# A Plan to Remake the Middle East
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uwwY_cQsyA)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, if and when Israel and Hamas reach a deal for a ceasefire, the United States
*  will immediately turn to a different set of negotiations over a grand diplomatic bargain
*  that it believes could rebuild Gaza and remake the Middle East.
*  My colleague, Michael Crowley, has been reporting on that plan and explains why those involved
*  in it believe they have so little time left to get it done.
*  It's Wednesday, May 8th.
*  Michael, I want to start with what feels like a pretty dizzying set of developments in this
*  conflict over the past few days.
*  Just walk us through them.
*  Well, over the weekend, there was an intense round of negotiations in an effort back by
*  the United States to reach a ceasefire in the Gaza war.
*  The latest ceasefire proposal would reportedly see as many as 33 Israeli hostages released
*  in exchange for potentially hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.
*  U.S. officials were very eager to get this deal.
*  A gesture for a ceasefire has been building ahead of a threatened Israeli assault on
*  Ra'aqa.
*  Because Israel has been threatening a military offensive in the southern Palestinian city
*  of Ra'aqa where a huge number of people are crowded.
*  Fleeing the violence to the north and now they're packed into Ra'aqa, exposed and vulnerable.
*  They need to be protected.
*  And the U.S. says it would be a humanitarian catastrophe on top of the emergency that's
*  already underway.
*  Right.
*  Breaking news this hour, very important breaking news.
*  An official Hamas source has told the BBC that it does accept a proposal for a ceasefire
*  deal in Gaza.
*  And for a few hours on Monday, it looked like there might have been a major breakthrough
*  when Hamas put out a statement saying that it had accepted a negotiating proposal.
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the ceasefire proposal does not meet
*  his country's requirements.
*  Benjamin Netanyahu says he will send a delegation of mediators to continue those talks.
*  But those hopes were dashed pretty quickly when the Israelis took a look at what Hamas
*  was saying and said that it was not a proposal that they had agreed to.
*  It had been modified.
*  And overnight, Israeli troops stormed into Ra'aqa, video showing tanks crashing over
*  a sign at the entrance of the city.
*  The Israelis launched a partial invasion of Ra'aqa.
*  Netanyahu says Hamas used the area to launch a deadly attack on Israeli troops over the
*  weekend.
*  And they have now secured a border crossing at the southern end of Gaza and are conducting
*  targeted strikes.
*  This is not yet the full scale invasion that President Biden has adamantly warned Israel
*  against undertaking.
*  But it is an escalation by Israel.
*  So, while all that drama might suggest that these talks are in big trouble, these talks
*  are very much still alive and ongoing.
*  And there is still a possibility of a ceasefire deal.
*  And the reason that's so important is not just to stop the fighting in Gaza and relieve
*  the suffering there.
*  But a ceasefire also opens the door to a grand diplomatic bargain, one that involves Israel
*  and its Arab neighbors and the Palestinians and would have very far reaching implications.
*  And what is that grand bargain?
*  Can you describe what you're talking about?
*  Well, it's incredibly ambitious.
*  It would reshape Israel's relationship with its Arab neighbors, principally Saudi Arabia.
*  But it's important to understand that this is a vision that has actually been around
*  since well before October 7th.
*  This was a diplomatic project that President Biden had been investing in and negotiating
*  actually in a very real and tangible way long before the Hamas attacks and the Gaza
*  War.
*  And President Biden was looking to build on something that President Trump had done, which
*  was a series of agreements that the Trump administration struck in which Israel and
*  some of its Arab neighbors agreed to have normal diplomatic relations for the first
*  time.
*  Right.
*  They're called the Abraham Accords.
*  That's right.
*  And, you know, Biden doesn't like a lot of things, most things that Trump did, but he
*  actually likes this because the idea is that they contribute to stability and economic
*  integration in the Middle East.
*  The U.S. likes Israel having friends and likes having a tight knit alliance against Iran.
*  President Biden agrees with the Saudis and with the Israelis that Iran is really the
*  top threat to everybody here.
*  So how can you build on this?
*  How can you expand it?
*  Well, the next and biggest step would be normalizing relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.
*  The Saudis have made clear that they want to do this and that they're ready to do this.
*  They weren't ready to do it in the Trump years.
*  But Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, has made clear he wants to do
*  it now.
*  So this kind of triangular deal began to take shape before October 7th, in which the U.S.,
*  Israel and Saudi Arabia would enter this three-way agreement in which everyone would get something
*  that they wanted.
*  And just walk through what each side gets in this pre-October 7th version of these negotiations.
*  So for Israel, you get normalized ties with its most important Arab neighbor and really
*  the country that sets the tone for the whole Muslim world, which is Saudi Arabia, of course.
*  It makes Israel feel safer and more secure.
*  Again, it helps to build this alliance against Iran, which Israel considers its greatest
*  threat.
*  And it comes with benefits like economic ties and travel and tourism.
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been very open, at least before October 7th, that
*  this was his highest diplomatic and foreign policy priority.
*  For the Saudis, the rationale is similar when it comes to Israel.
*  They think that it will bring stability.
*  They like having a more explicitly close ally against Iran.
*  There are economic and cultural benefits.
*  Saudi Arabia is opening itself up in general, encouraging more tourism.
*  But I think that what's most important to the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is what
*  he can get from the United States.
*  And what he has been asking for are a couple of essential things.
*  One is a security agreement whose details have always been a little bit vague, but I
*  think essentially come down to reliable arms supplies from the United States that are not
*  going to be cut off or paused on a whim, as he felt happened when President Biden stopped
*  arms deliveries in 2021 because of how Saudi was conducting its war in Yemen.
*  The Saudis were furious about that.
*  Saudi Arabia also wants to start a domestic nuclear power program.
*  They are planning for a very long term future, possibly a post oil future, and they need
*  help getting a nuclear program off the ground.
*  And they want that from the US.
*  And they want that from the US.
*  Now those are big asks from the US.
*  But from the perspective of President Biden, there are some really enticing things about
*  this possible agreement.
*  One is that it will hopefully produce more stability in the region.
*  Again, the US likes having a tight knit alliance against Iran.
*  The US also wants to have a strong relationship with Saudi Arabia.
*  Despite the anger at Mohammed bin Salman over the murder of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi,
*  The Biden administration recognizes that given the Saudis control over global oil production
*  and their strategic importance in the Middle East, they need to have a good relationship
*  with them.
*  And the administration has been worried about the influence of China in the region and with
*  the Saudis in particular.
*  So this is an opportunity for the US to draw the Saudis closer, whatever our moral qualms
*  might be about bin Salman and the Saudi government.
*  This is an opportunity to bring the Saudis closer, which is something the Biden administration
*  sees as a strategic benefit.
*  All three of these countries, big disparate countries that normally don't see eye to eye,
*  this was a win, win, win on a military, economic and strategic front.
*  That's right.
*  But there was one important actor in the region that did not see itself as winning.
*  And that was the Palestinians.
*  First it's important to understand that the Palestinians have always expected that the
*  Arab countries in the Middle East would insist that Israel recognize a Palestinian state
*  before those countries were willing to essentially make total peace and have normal relations
*  with Israel.
*  So when the Abraham Accords happened in the Trump administration, the Palestinians felt
*  like they'd been thrown under the bus because the Abraham Accords gave them virtually nothing.
*  But the Palestinians did still hold out hope that Saudi Arabia would be their savior.
*  And for years, Saudi Arabia has said that Israel must give the Palestinians a state
*  if there's going to be a normal relationship between Israel and Saudi Arabia.
*  Now the Palestinians see the Saudis in discussions with the US and Israel about a normalization
*  agreement.
*  And there appears to be very little on offer for the Palestinians.
*  And they are feeling like they're going to be left out in the cold here.
*  Right. And in the minds of the Palestinians, having already been essentially sold out by
*  all their other Arab neighbors, the prospect that Saudi Arabia, of all countries, the most
*  important Muslim Arab country in the region, would sell them out, had to be extremely painful.
*  It was a nightmare scenario for them.
*  And in the minds of many analysts and US officials, this was a factor, one of many, in Hamas's
*  decision to stage the October 7th attacks.
*  Hamas, like other Palestinian leaders, was seeing the prospect that the Middle East was
*  moving on and essentially, in their view, giving up on the Palestinian cause.
*  And that Israel would be able to have friendly normal relations with Arab countries around
*  the region, and that it could continue with hardline policies toward the Palestinians
*  and a refusal, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said publicly, to accept a Palestinian
*  state.
*  Right.
*  So, Michael, once Hamas carries out the October 7th attacks in an effort to destroy a status
*  quo that it thinks is leaving them less and less relevant, more and more hopeless, including
*  potentially this prospect that Saudi Arabia is going to normalize relations with Israel,
*  what happens to these pre-October 7th negotiations between the US, Saudi Arabia, and Israel?
*  Well, I think there was a snap assumption that these talks were dead and buried, that
*  they couldn't possibly survive a cataclysm like this.
*  Right.
*  But then something surprising happened.
*  It became clear that all the parties were still determined to pull off the normalization.
*  And most surprisingly of all, perhaps, was the continued eagerness of Saudi Arabia, which
*  publicly was professing outrage over the Israeli response to the Hamas attacks, but privately
*  was still very much engaged in these conversations and trying to move them forward.
*  In fact, what has happened is that the scope of this effort has grown substantially.
*  October 7th didn't kill these talks.
*  It actually made them bigger, more complicated, and some people would argue more important than ever.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Michael, walk us through what exactly happens to these three-way negotiations after October 7th
*  that ends up making them, as you just said, more complicated and more important than ever.
*  Well, it's more important than ever because of the incredible need in Gaza.
*  And it's going to take a deal like this and the approval of Saudi Arabia to unlock the
*  kind of massive reconstruction project required to essentially rebuild Gaza from the rubble.
*  Saudi Arabia and its Arab friends are also going to be instrumental in figuring out how
*  Gaza is governed and they might even provide troops to help secure it.
*  None of those things are going to happen without a deal like this.
*  Fascinating.
*  But this is all much more complicated now because the price for a deal like this has
*  gone up.
*  And by price you mean?
*  What Israel would have to give up.
*  From Saudi Arabia's perspective, you have an Arab population that is furious at Israel.
*  It now feels like a really hard time to do a normalization deal with the Israelis.
*  It was never going to be easy.
*  But this is about as bad a time to do it as there has been in a generation at least.
*  And I think that President Biden and the people around him understand that the status quo
*  between Israel and the Palestinians is intolerable and it is going to lead to chaos and violence
*  indefinitely.
*  So now you have two of the three parties to this agreement.
*  The Saudis and the Americans basically asking a new price after October 7th and saying to
*  the Israelis, if we're going to do this deal, it has to not only do something for the Palestinians,
*  it has to do something really big.
*  You have to commit to the creation of a Palestinian state.
*  Now I'll be specific and say that what you hear the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken,
*  say is that the agreement has to include an irreversible time bound path to a Palestinian
*  state.
*  We don't know exactly what that looks like.
*  But it's some kind of a firm commitment, the likes of which the world and certainly the
*  Israelis have not made before.
*  Something that was very much not present in the pre October 7th vision of this negotiation,
*  so much so that, as we just talked about, the Palestinians were left feeling completely
*  out in the cold and furious at it.
*  That's right.
*  There was no sign that people were thinking that ambitiously about the Palestinians in
*  this deal before October 7th.
*  And the Palestinians certainly felt like they weren't going to get much out of it.
*  And that has completely changed now.
*  So Michael, once this big new dimension after October 7th, which is the insistence by Saudi
*  Arabia and the US that there be a Palestinian state or a path to a Palestinian state, what
*  is the reaction specifically from Israel, which is, of course, the third major party
*  to this entire conversation?
*  Well Israel, or at least its political leadership, hates it.
*  This is just an extremely tough sell in Israel.
*  It would have been a tough sell before October 7th.
*  It's even harder now.
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is completely, unrepentantly open in saying that there's
*  not going to be a Palestinian state on his watch.
*  He won't accept it.
*  He says that it's a strategic risk to his country.
*  He says that it would in effect reward Hamas.
*  His argument is that terrorism has forced a conversation about statehood onto the table
*  that wasn't there before October 7th.
*  Sure, it's always in the background.
*  It's a perennial issue in global affairs.
*  But it was not something, certainly, that the US and Israel's Arab neighbors were actively
*  pushing.
*  Netanyahu also has, he governs with the support of very right-wing members of a political
*  coalition that he has cobbled together.
*  That coalition is quite likely to fall apart if he does embrace a Palestinian state or
*  a path to a Palestinian state.
*  Now, he might be able to cobble together some sort of alternative, but it creates a political
*  crisis for him.
*  And finally, I think in any conversation about Israel, it's worth bearing in mind something
*  you hear from senior US officials these days, which is that although there is often finger
*  pointing at Netanyahu and a desire to blame Netanyahu as this obstructionist who won't
*  agree to deals, what they say is Netanyahu is largely reflecting his population and the
*  establishment of his country, not just the right-wingers in his coalition who are clearly
*  extremists, but actually the prevailing views of the Israeli public.
*  And the Israeli public and their political leaders across the spectrum right now, with
*  few exceptions, are not interested in talking about a Palestinian state when there are still
*  dozens and dozens of Israeli hostages in tunnels beneath Gaza.
*  So it very much looks like this giant agreement that once seemed doable before October 7th
*  might be more important to everyone involved than ever, given that it's a plan for rebuilding
*  Gaza and potentially preventing future October 7th from happening.
*  But because of this higher price that Israel would have to pay, which is the acceptance
*  of a Palestinian state, it seems from everything you're saying that this is more and more out
*  of reach than ever before and hard to imagine happening in the immediate future.
*  So if the people negotiating it are being honest, Michael, are they ready to acknowledge
*  that doesn't look like this is going to happen?
*  Well not quite yet.
*  As time goes by, they certainly say it's getting harder and harder, but they're still trying.
*  They still think there's a chance.
*  But both the Saudis and the Biden administration understand that there's very little time left
*  to do this.
*  Well, what do you mean there's very little time left?
*  It would seem like time might benefit this negotiation in that it might give Israel distance
*  from October 7th to think potentially differently about a Palestinian state.
*  Potentially.
*  But Saudi Arabia wants to get this deal done in the Biden administration because Mohammed
*  bin Salman has concluded this has to be done under a Democratic president.
*  Why?
*  Because Democrats in Congress are going to be very reluctant to approve a security agreement
*  between the United States and Saudi Arabia.
*  It's important to understand that if there is a security agreement, that's something
*  Congress is going to have to approve.
*  And you're just not going to get enough Democrats in Congress to support a deal with Saudi Arabia,
*  who a lot of Democrats don't like to begin with because they see them as human rights
*  abusers.
*  But if a Democratic president is asking them to do it, they're much more likely to go along.
*  So Saudi Arabia fears that if Biden loses and Trump is president, that those same Democrats
*  would balk at this deal in a way that they wouldn't if it were being negotiated under
*  President Biden.
*  Exactly.
*  Now from President Biden's perspective, politically, think about a president who's running for
*  reelection, who is presiding right now over chaos in the Middle East, who doesn't seem
*  to have good answers for the Israeli-Palestinian question.
*  This is an opportunity for President Biden to deliver what could be, at least what he
*  would present as a diplomatic masterstroke that does multiple things at once, including
*  creating a new pathway for Israel and the Palestinians to coexist, to break through
*  the logjam, even as he's also improving Israel's relations with Saudi Arabia.
*  So Biden and the Crown Prince hope that they can somehow persuade Bibi Netanyahu that in
*  spite of all the reasons that he thinks this is a terrible idea, that this is a bet worth
*  taking on Israel's and the region's long-term security and future.
*  That's right.
*  Now, no one has explained very clearly exactly how this is going to work, and it's probably
*  going to require artful diplomacy, possibly even a scenario where the Israelis would agree
*  to something that maybe means one thing to them and means something else to other people.
*  But Biden officials refuse to say that it's hopeless, and they refuse to essentially take
*  Netanyahu's preliminary no's for an answer.
*  And they still see some way that they can thread this incredibly narrow needle.
*  Michael, I'm curious about a constituency that we haven't been talking about because
*  they're not at the table in these discussions that we are talking about here.
*  And that would be Hamas.
*  How does Hamas feel about the prospect of such a deal like this ever taking shape?
*  Do they see it as any kind of a victory and vindication for what they did on October 7th?
*  So it's hard to know exactly what Hamas's leadership is thinking.
*  I think they can feel two things.
*  I think they can feel on the one hand that they have established themselves as the champions
*  of the Palestinian people who struck a blow against Israel and against a diplomatic process
*  that was potentially going to leave the Palestinians out in the cold.
*  At the same time, Hamas has no interest in the kind of two-state solution that the US
*  is trying to promote.
*  They think Israel should be destroyed.
*  They think the Palestinian state should cover the entire geography of what is now Israel.
*  And they want to lead a state like that.
*  And that's not something that the US, Saudi Arabia, or anyone else is going to tolerate.
*  So what Hamas wants is to fight, to be the leader of the Palestinian people, and to destroy
*  Israel.
*  So they're interested in any sort of a peace process or statehood process.
*  It seems very clear from everything you've said here that neither Israel nor Hamas is
*  ready to have the conversation about a grand bargain diplomatic program.
*  And I wonder if that inevitably has any bearing on the ceasefire negotiations that are going
*  on right now between the two of them that are supposed to bring this conflict to some
*  sort of an end, even if it's just temporary.
*  Because if, as you said, Michael, a ceasefire opens the door to this larger diplomatic solution
*  and these two players don't necessarily want that larger diplomatic solution, doesn't that
*  inevitably impact their enthusiasm for even reaching a ceasefire?
*  Well, it certainly doesn't help.
*  This is such a hellish problem.
*  And of course, you first have the question of whether Israel and Hamas can make a deal
*  on these immediate issues, including the hostages, Palestinian prisoners, what the Israeli military
*  is going to do, how long a ceasefire might last.
*  But on top of that, you have these much bigger diplomatic questions that are looming over
*  them.
*  And it's not clear that either side is ready to turn and face those bigger questions.
*  So while for the Biden administration and for Saudi Arabia, this is a way out of this
*  crisis, these larger diplomatic solutions, it's not clear that it's a conversation that
*  the two parties that are actually at war here are prepared to start having.
*  Well, Michael, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you.
*  On Tuesday afternoon, under intense pressure from the US, delegations from Israel and Hamas
*  arrived in Cairo to resume negotiations over a potential ceasefire.
*  But in a statement, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made clear that even with
*  the talks underway, his government would, quote, continue to wage war against Hamas.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  In a dramatic day of testimony, Stormy Daniels offered explicit details about an alleged
*  sexual encounter with Donald Trump that ultimately led to the hush money payment at the center
*  of his trial.
*  The judge in the case rejected that request.
*  And...
*  In a speech on Tuesday honoring victims of the Holocaust, President Biden condemned what
*  he said was the alarming rise of anti-Semitism in the United States after the October 7 attacks
*  on Israel.
*  And he expressed worry that too many Americans were already forgetting the horrors of that
*  attack.
*  The Jewish community wants you to know, I see your fear, your hurt, your pain.
*  Let me reassure you, as your president, you're not alone.
*  You belong.
*  You always have and you always will.
