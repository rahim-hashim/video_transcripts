# How TikTok Became a Matter of National Security
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YAMUpWtVPE)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverdisy, and this is The Daily.
*  TikTok is one of the most popular apps in the country, used by one out of every three
*  Americans.
*  In recent weeks, the Biden administration has threatened to ban it.
*  Today, Sapna Maheshwari, on how an app known for videos of lip-syncing, dancing, and bread
*  baking is now seen by the U.S. government as a threat to national security.
*  It's Monday, March 20th.
*  So Sapna, you're a business reporter for the Times, and you cover TikTok, which is, of
*  course, an extremely popular app that lots of people are using.
*  And for many months now, it has been surrounded by lots of controversy.
*  And I want you to tell me about that.
*  Tell me what's happening.
*  Sure.
*  So TikTok is, of course, a super popular app.
*  It's full of short-form videos.
*  Teens love it.
*  They're on it all the time.
*  But TikTok, while it appears on your phone with apps like Instagram and Snapchat and
*  Twitter, stands apart from these companies because it's owned by a Chinese company called
*  ByteDance.
*  And that ownership has increasingly been raising skepticism and alarm bells with the U.S. government.
*  And just recently, the Biden administration reportedly told TikTok that it wants the company's
*  Chinese ownership to sell TikTok or face a possible ban in the U.S.
*  So a ban seems like a pretty drastic thing, Sapna.
*  Like, what is the fear here?
*  What's the government saying?
*  So basically, for a long time now, the government has been worried about national security
*  concerns tied to TikTok.
*  And when you look at TikTok and you look at what teens are watching, that may sound crazy on
*  the face of it. But because of the company's Chinese ownership, U.S.
*  officials have said that there is a chance that TikTok could be used by the Chinese
*  government to collect information on Americans or influence them through TikTok's
*  content. And this moment is really pivotal because the Biden administration is saying,
*  hey, this is a huge risk and we're doing something about it.
*  So, Sapna, how did we get here?
*  I mean, how did a Chinese company create one of the most beloved apps in America?
*  So we have to start with the company that owns TikTok, ByteDance, with a Y.
*  It's a company that makes apps and it was founded in 2012 by a Chinese entrepreneur
*  named Zhang Yiming.
*  This was a young man who was very much inspired by companies like Amazon, by people
*  like Mark Zuckerberg.
*  And he was looking at the contributions these people had made and was thinking, you know,
*  I want to make something like that, but from China, I'm going to make something that's
*  global, that transcends our borders and put China on the map.
*  So he wants to create products that everyone around the world would use, like be the
*  Chinese Mark Zuckerberg.
*  Yeah, exactly. And what's really interesting is he carried that dream into the ByteDance
*  corporate culture.
*  He would quote tech icons like Steve Jobs, and he was known for putting this motto on the
*  walls that said, always day one.
*  It was a motivational phrase that was taken directly from Amazon.
*  And you could see where his aspirations were going.
*  So, Sapna, how did he go about trying to achieve that dream?
*  What did he do?
*  So ByteDance starts out making popular apps in China, but everything really picks up a
*  few years later when he notices a breakout app in the U.S.
*  called Musically.
*  It was best known as an app where you could make short videos with music and it had this
*  cult following with American teenagers.
*  He took a real interest in this, saw how it was resonating with young people.
*  And after trying to imitate it a bit, he goes on to try and acquire it, which he does.
*  So he buys Musically in 2017 and then repackages it into a new app called TikTok.
*  And then he launches it in the U.S.
*  And that's kind of his stepping stone into an American audience.
*  OK, so he gets this foothold into the American market through this other app, Musically.
*  But there's a lot of apps out there, right?
*  Like, what does he do to make this one breakthrough?
*  There's all these different things that make TikTok so accessible.
*  People are really able to just take out their phone and start filming.
*  You can do things like reaction videos.
*  You can apply different clips of music or sounds to your videos, and then other users
*  can remix them. And TikTok is less about connecting with your family and friends and more
*  about getting you to watch all these short videos.
*  And it really sought to be more like television, less of a sort of traditional social media
*  app. When you open the app, you're immediately served this unending stream of really short
*  videos. And very quickly, the app starts paying attention to what you do next.
*  It looks at how long you watch that video, what second you switch away from it.
*  If you comment on that video, if you send it to a friend, it's keeping track of all of
*  that information and it's using that to quickly tailor the next video you see and the next
*  and the next after that. And its algorithm is excellent at figuring out what you liked
*  and serving you more of that.
*  OK, so its special sauce is its algorithm and the fact that it's serving up these short,
*  very tailored to my taste videos like potato chips that people are just eating and eating
*  So what happens out there in the world when people start using it?
*  So TikTok starts picking up a following.
*  People seem to really like the app.
*  But the real game changer comes in 2020 when, as we all know, the pandemic hit and it just
*  blows up. OK, I'm bored in the house and I'm in the house bored, bored in the house and
*  I'm in the house bored.
*  People are turning to TikTok for entertainment and they're discovering how easy it is to
*  make videos.
*  So I have a decent amount of experience making bread in high school.
*  I actually had.
*  They're doing all their quarantine activities on there.
*  They're making bread and playing with makeup.
*  So that's what I'm going to do first.
*  I'm just putting bronzer all over my nose.
*  But they're also doing quirkier things that start to take off as trends.
*  How to make pancake cereal.
*  They're making pancake cereal, which is mini pancakes poured into a cereal bowl and
*  eaten like cereal.
*  My dad's flipping them with toothpicks.
*  Like really small little pancakes.
*  Yes, it becomes super popular.
*  Different fashion trends take off.
*  Cottagecore probably credits some of its success to TikTok.
*  What is Cottagecore?
*  Put a finger down if you own more than three flower printed clothing items, have more
*  than two glass bottles in your room.
*  It's like this very whimsical pastoral aesthetic that makes it look like you just stepped
*  out of a cottage in the forest and you spend your time wearing flowy dresses and making
*  flower crowns.
*  The one good thing about this quarantine is that my wardrobe can now consist completely
*  of my vintage nightgowns.
*  And there's also all kinds of dance challenges.
*  There's a million examples, but one of them is the Savage Challenge from Megan The
*  Stallion.
*  One TikTok user choreographed a dance to it.
*  Another one started imitating it in their own videos.
*  And then all of a sudden, Savage goes viral and hits number one on the Billboard charts.
*  And so it starts really affecting the mainstream culture.
*  And you start to see some of the popular dancers or people who are just doing interesting
*  things on the platform start to become really famous.
*  Dancing was always a part of my life.
*  There's this one personality, Charli D'Amelio.
*  She started out making dance videos in her bedroom.
*  She gains a ton of fans.
*  And a year later, her family has their own Hulu show.
*  Whoa.
*  We're the D'Amelio.
*  And you really start to see TikTok play this role in the real world.
*  Interesting.
*  And then as TikTok gets more and more users, it starts to wade into the topic of current
*  events.
*  If you've been paying attention to the news, you know that Donald Trump is planning on
*  holding his first political rally post-quarantine.
*  And there's this notable event in June of 2020 where ahead of this big Trump rally,
*  Somebody on another TikTok post commented that he was offering two free tickets on his
*  campaign website.
*  A ton of TikTok users and Korean pop fans register for thousands of seats.
*  And the administration then gets ready for this event.
*  They prepare all this seating, overflow seating.
*  The event comes and it's largely empty.
*  There is a lot of Twitter traffic that says he was played by young people and K-pop fans.
*  I remember this.
*  Like all of these kids pranking the president of the United States, basically.
*  Exactly.
*  And they claim their victory on where else?
*  TikTok.
*  I think I've done theater shows in high school that have more of an audience than that.
*  You're playing.
*  And we'll do it again, baby.
*  So essentially that speaks to the muscle the app has, right?
*  That like, it's not just about, you know, bread baking or dancing.
*  It's also having an effect on politics.
*  Yes.
*  And it just keeps growing and growing.
*  And by August of 2020, TikTok was saying it had more than a hundred million active monthly
*  users in America.
*  So that's just huge, right?
*  I mean, one in three Americans using the thing.
*  At this point, it seems like ByteDance's founder kind of got what he wanted.
*  Right.
*  I mean, he's built this global tech company and all of these people are on it.
*  He's arrived.
*  Exactly.
*  But the problem is that as TikTok became this undeniable success story, it was also
*  catching the attention of the U.S.
*  government.
*  Lawmakers start talking about how maybe we should be taking a look at TikTok and the
*  fact that such a popular app is connected to China.
*  And then.
*  We're looking at TikTok.
*  We may be banning TikTok.
*  We may be doing some other things.
*  Trump starts talking about banning TikTok.
*  We are looking at a lot of alternatives with respect to TikTok.
*  And this is a really big moment.
*  He issues two executive orders.
*  One is effectively banning TikTok and the other forces ByteDance to sell TikTok to an
*  American company.
*  So the message is very clear.
*  And that is that TikTok is now being seen as a threat by the U.S.
*  government. And actually, as it turns out, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the
*  U.S., this really important government committee known as CFIUS that's in charge of
*  looking at deals that involve foreign companies, has already been investigating TikTok
*  for a while.
*  And Sapna, what exactly is it investigating?
*  So there's two big concerns around TikTok.
*  One is the data that they have on American users and the other is misinformation and
*  censorship. So let's look at the data part.
*  Think about all the information that you share with an app on your phone.
*  It's IP addresses, its location.
*  It could be your whole contacts list.
*  Right.
*  The concern here is that there's a Chinese law that requires private companies in China
*  to confidentially turn over information requested by the Chinese government.
*  So in other words, China could actually get data from 100 million Americans and it can
*  do it legally.
*  That's the concern.
*  And Sapna, what are we worried that China might do with that data?
*  Like, why is it bad that China would get American data?
*  So the fear is that the Chinese government could potentially use it to spy on certain
*  Americans, to harass or blackmail them.
*  This kind of data is so personal and sensitive that it could be misused in maybe ways that
*  we can't even conceive of.
*  And what about the second concern?
*  The other big concern is really about the actual videos that are getting shown on TikTok.
*  This is about content moderation and whether the Chinese government could potentially
*  harness TikTok to spread misinformation or censor certain content and basically influence
*  what Americans are thinking.
*  People are worried, for example, that the Chinese government could use TikTok to promote
*  or suppress certain content when it works in their favor, say, U.S.
*  elections or news about China.
*  But isn't this a problem with American companies, too?
*  I mean, Facebook famously has these problems with data and misinformation, right?
*  Yes, definitely. These are things that the U.S.
*  government is worried about with U.S.
*  companies. But the difference here is that this is a Chinese company and the fear is
*  that they have to answer to the Chinese government at the end of the day.
*  OK, so these are the things that the U.S.
*  government is worried about.
*  Data gathering on Americans, misinformation and censorship.
*  But does the Trump administration have proof that these things are actually happening?
*  So at this point, there's not a lot of proof that TikTok is actually mishandling data or
*  manipulating videos.
*  And Trump's attempts to ban TikTok also face legal challenges right away.
*  And courts say that he doesn't have the authority to ban the app.
*  And then it seems like a new day for TikTok when Biden takes office.
*  He shelves the plan to sell TikTok to American companies.
*  He revokes Trump's executive orders and he replaces them with a more general order to keep
*  investigating foreign controlled apps like TikTok.
*  It even seems like the Biden administration and TikTok could reach a deal around how to
*  address some of these national security concerns.
*  But then in 2022, there are some new revelations that show that some of these fears are
*  actually grounded in reality.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Sapna, you just told me that in 2022, we started to see some real there there when it
*  came to, you know, actual security risks from TikTok.
*  What were we seeing at that time?
*  So there's some reporting from BuzzFeed News that comes out that starts really exploring
*  the relationship between fight dance in China and TikTok in the United States.
*  BuzzFeed reports that China based employees of fight dance have repeatedly accessed the
*  data about U.S. TikTok users.
*  It shows that apparently employees of fight dance in China have been getting their hands
*  on the data of U.S.
*  users and this kind of data was accessed repeatedly by employees who are based in China,
*  potentially exposing Americans personal information to China's government.
*  And the reporting at BuzzFeed News makes this allegation based on internal recordings at
*  the company. Employees can be heard saying phrases like everything is seen in China and
*  also refer to Beijing based engineers as the master admin who have access to everything.
*  And a few months later, it emerges that fight dance employees actually went on to try and
*  track this journalist and figure out where she was getting these leaks.
*  I don't know when they first tried to track me.
*  Wow, so that does seem like the kind of thing that the U.S.
*  government was worried about, right?
*  That's right. And fight dance basically admitted that four of its employees had been
*  obtaining the data of this journalist using her IP address.
*  That means the company knows the IP address of my house, which I'd rather they didn't.
*  But but they say they fired these bad actors and these are isolated incidents and they
*  try to move on.
*  So it does feel vindicating to hear that the company has acknowledged that they did this
*  and that they're taking responsibility for it.
*  But at the end of the day, there is really no putting a genie back in the bottle.
*  Once it is accessed in Beijing, the idea that there's a clawback or way to control or limit
*  access, it just doesn't make sense.
*  And all of a sudden, this gives a lot of ammunition to lawmakers who have already been
*  concerned about TikTok.
*  This company should be banned.
*  I don't know why they're allowed to operate in the United States.
*  And around this time, everything just really starts escalating.
*  You have the FBI director warning that the Chinese government could use TikTok for
*  influence operations.
*  All of these things are in the hands of a government that doesn't share our values and
*  that has a mission that's very much at odds with what's in the best interest of the
*  United States. That should concern us.
*  A growing list of states just starts banning TikTok on any devices that come from the
*  government. Nebraska was first to do this in 2020, but now South Dakota, South Carolina,
*  Texas and Maryland all joining in just this week.
*  And what's unique here is that this is really a bipartisan effort.
*  Initially, the states that are trying to ban TikTok are led by Republican governors.
*  But before long, it includes Democrats, too.
*  At least 31 states, including Texas, have enacted some sort of TikTok ban, mainly on
*  government owned phones and computers.
*  And then Biden signs a ban of TikTok on all government provided federal devices.
*  The White House announcing Monday that government agencies have 30 days to delete TikTok
*  from their devices and systems.
*  The White House officials say the guidance is part of the administration's commitment to
*  protecting the American people's security and privacy.
*  Like, basically, the Biden administration is saying, you know, TikTok is dangerous enough
*  that if you have anything to do with the government, you shouldn't be using it on your
*  government held device.
*  Yeah, it's basically saying that it's a national security threat to have TikTok on a
*  phone that the government gave you.
*  And then around the same time, you have a bunch of different U.S.
*  lawmakers who start to introduce bills that are designed to essentially ban TikTok
*  nationally, even for the regular everyday users of TikTok.
*  OK, so there's this bipartisan flurry of bans of TikTok.
*  What's TikTok saying about all of this?
*  I think, first of all, that we take all these concerns very seriously.
*  We have been studying them.
*  And for the last couple of years, we've been working with CFIUS and with our engineers
*  to try and solve what we think is a very solvable problem.
*  So TikTok is saying that all of these accusations are really unfair and that it's
*  never turned over data to the Chinese government, that it's never manipulated what
*  Americans are watching to promote any Chinese government goals.
*  Now, for us, you know, no foreign government has asked us for U.S.
*  user data before. Really, they haven't.
*  And if they did, we would say no.
*  And they really step up their efforts in Washington.
*  They start meeting with lawmakers who have been critical of the app to defend themselves.
*  And at the same time, they've been negotiating this plan with the Biden administration
*  through this body that we talked about called CFIUS.
*  They have submitted this plan to this group that basically details how they can continue
*  to operate in the U.S. while addressing these national security concerns and remaining
*  under Chinese ownership.
*  And this plan is really detailed.
*  It's 90 pages long.
*  It describes how U.S.
*  user data will be stored, how it will prevent access from employees in China.
*  It says that there will be the special oversight and transparency around its content
*  recommendation algorithms.
*  And they are saying that they're going to spend billions of dollars on this plan, one
*  and a half billion dollars initially, and then up to a billion dollars annually after
*  that. And then just last week, the news emerges that the Biden administration is actually
*  pressuring the company's Chinese ownership to either sell or face a potential ban.
*  Right. Which, of course, brings us back to where we started this conversation.
*  Right. So the Biden administration doesn't seem to be convinced by TikTok's plan.
*  And now, in a way, it's trying to finish what Trump started.
*  Right. That's right.
*  But this time around, you have both Republicans and Democrats who are united in this
*  effort against TikTok, which is really different from 2020.
*  And there's even one interesting new bill that's gaining a lot of traction right now
*  called the Restrict Act that could give more power to the Biden administration to
*  potentially either ban or force a sale of the app.
*  So some people are looking to this as a potential game changer this time around for
*  taking action against TikTok.
*  OK, so the Biden administration could have more authority now than the Trump administration
*  had. It's possible, but experts think that the Biden administration is going to run
*  into a lot of the same problems that the Trump administration did.
*  You already have groups like the ACLU that have come out and said that a ban on
*  TikTok would threaten the First Amendment rights of Americans.
*  And then when it comes to a potential sale, there are just so many questions around
*  what that looks like.
*  TikTok could be incredibly expensive.
*  There may not be that many companies in the United States that could afford it.
*  You know, some of the companies that could afford it, like Google or Facebook, might
*  run into antitrust issues.
*  They may not want to take on a company like TikTok, even though it's so popular.
*  And there's also the question around what China will allow.
*  There could be rules from the Chinese government that prevent the export of TikTok's
*  algorithm, the thing that makes it so compelling and so popular.
*  And so it's going to be really fascinating to watch this play out because there's a
*  lot of uncertainty around the shape that this takes.
*  So, Stepna, stepping back here for a minute, I mean, it strikes me that, you know,
*  whether you see TikTok as a wholesome app meant for dancing and bread baking or a
*  security risk really depends on how you see the world right now.
*  And I think the way that the U.S.
*  sees the world right now increasingly is that China is a threat.
*  So, you know, in many ways, it seems sort of inevitable that the U.S.
*  is taking this approach, even though it's pretty weird, right?
*  Because this is an app where teenagers have fun and the U.S.
*  government is bringing down its entire weight on it.
*  Exactly. And I think that this debate around TikTok is really a barometer for the
*  tensions between the U.S.
*  and China right now.
*  The Biden administration seems to be looking at TikTok as a loaded gun.
*  And the U.S. is basically saying that it doesn't trust this kind of technology
*  company that's based in China to remain immune from the demands or influence of
*  the Chinese government.
*  And that's a really big deal for relations between the two countries.
*  It's interesting because we started this episode with a story of a Chinese
*  entrepreneur, right, who who wanted to create a truly global tech company, one
*  that could be as successful in the U.S.
*  as it was in China.
*  But if the U.S.
*  ends up banning TikTok or forcing the sale of TikTok, what does that say about
*  whether what the founder of this company wanted is even possible at this point,
*  not just for this company, but for any Chinese company?
*  Well, this is definitely challenging that dream.
*  And it raises a lot of questions around what kinds of social media companies and
*  technology companies can flourish in America in the future.
*  And it's worth noting that for years now, China has banned platforms like Facebook
*  or YouTube. And a lot of people never thought that that kind of thing would
*  happen in the U.S.
*  But that could be the road that we're going down.
*  Sapna, thank you.
*  Thanks.
*  On Thursday, TikTok CEO will testify in Congress before the House Energy and
*  Commerce Committee. He will face questions about TikTok's ties to China and
*  concerns that it delivers harmful content to young people.
*  The scheduled hearing comes after news outlets, including the New York Times,
*  reported that the Department of Justice is investigating the surveillance of
*  journalists by ByteDance last year.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  Over the weekend, former President Donald Trump warned his supporters that he
*  could be arrested as soon as tomorrow over a case stemming from the payment of
*  hush money to an adult film star during his 2016 campaign.
*  In a message posted on the social media platform, Truth Social, Trump urged
*  supporters to protest what he described as his impending indictment.
*  But the indictment is not a certainty.
*  Prosecutors in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, which is handling the
*  case, have signaled an indictment could be imminent, but have given no precise
*  timetable from when it might come.
*  And the Times reports that at least a year before the collapse of Silicon
*  Valley Bank, the Federal Reserve had warned the bank that its finances
*  appeared risky.
*  Despite those warnings, Silicon Valley Bank did not fix the problems.
*  Finally, Credit Suisse, the beleaguered Swiss bank, was taken over by a rival
*  bank on Sunday in a hastily arranged deal that was supported by the Swiss
*  government and intended to reassure investors.
*  UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse after Switzerland's central bank lent it 100
*  billion Swiss francs to support the purchase.
*  It was the most consequential fallout to date from the turmoil that spread from
*  the implosion of Silicon Valley Bank.
