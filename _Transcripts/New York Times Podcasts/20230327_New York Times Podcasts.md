*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Borrow.
*  This is Adali.
*  A few days ago, Republican officials in Utah went further than any other state to protect
*  children from the risks of social media.
*  My colleague, Natasha Singer, says that despite the unusualness of what Utah did, it may be
*  a sign of where the entire country is headed.
*  It's Monday, March 27.
*  Natasha, tell us about what happened late last week in Utah.
*  Last Thursday, in Utah, at three o'clock in the afternoon, local time.
*  Ladies and gentlemen, it is an honor to have all of you here today.
*  The governor held a ceremonial event in which he signed into law a package of bills that
*  will fundamentally change how children and teens in Utah use social media.
*  These are first of their kind bills in the United States.
*  These laws are designed to make kids safer online, but they go further than any other laws
*  in the land.
*  That's huge that Utah is leading out on this effort.
*  What he was doing was he had timed the event to a hearing in Congress on the fate of
*  TikTok.
*  And it was as if the governor of Utah was saying to Congress, you folks, while you're
*  blathering away about the harms of TikTok.
*  Here in Utah, we're actually going to do something about it.
*  Any legislators that are here can come up on any advocacy groups.
*  We're taking action while you folks are having a hearing.
*  Right.
*  He stood there and said, I am making some history here.
*  Exactly.
*  Other states may have similar laws, but this one is the most restrictive.
*  Okay.
*  So what exactly does this law actually do?
*  Well, the first thing it does is it prohibits social media companies from allowing people
*  under 18 to have an account unless they have the explicit permission of parents.
*  And that is going to affect people under 18 on a whole bunch of services, whether it's
*  Instagram or TikTok or Twitter.
*  Right.
*  In effect, it kind of is a default to no access unless a parent opts their child in.
*  Yes.
*  It's going to cut off young people in Utah from a large swath of the internet unless
*  their parents account by account, social media service by social media service approve.
*  Got it.
*  Okay.
*  What else does it do?
*  The second thing it does is it gives parents access to their child's accounts.
*  So that means what the students posted, videos, messages they sent, messages they received
*  from other people, what they searched for.
*  So even if a parent opts their child into social media under this law, that parent would
*  still have access to their child's direct messages, list of followers, pictures that
*  are posted pictures that are sent privately through direct messages.
*  Basically, any social media activity would have to be made available to a parent.
*  Correct.
*  The intimate messages they sent to their friends, the joky pictures, maybe they went
*  somewhere their parents didn't know.
*  Everything will be available to parents.
*  And it's like a law mandating that parents should have access to their kids' diaries.
*  Right.
*  And we know our buried under mattresses for a reason because parents aren't supposed
*  to see them.
*  Exactly.
*  So we're talking about how this law could change young people's relationship to the internet,
*  but it could also change the dynamics between parents and children.
*  Right.
*  And the third major thing this law does is it will require social media networks to block
*  access for minors in Utah to their accounts overnight.
*  Unless their parents change the setting.
*  During the hours when presumably you're supposed to be sleeping.
*  Exactly.
*  So Natasha, this is very clearly and by far the strictest and most significant effort
*  in the country to reign in the use of social media by minors.
*  And it's not a secret that parents have been craving away to limit their kids' access
*  to these kinds of platforms.
*  But what case did lawmakers in Utah make for such an expansive and sweeping set of restrictions
*  that you just described?
*  The people who wrote this law are people who like many parents across the country are concerned
*  that social media increases the risk of depression, anxiety, insomnia, the risk of cyberbullying,
*  the risk of predation by strangers.
*  And I think that there's another thing that concerned them, which is we all know that
*  social media platforms use these powerful algorithms and design techniques to hook users
*  and hijack their attention.
*  And the lawmakers behind this package of bills felt like children and teens do not have
*  the power to resist some of these powerful attention hijacking techniques.
*  Right.
*  I mean, we barely have the power to resist the attention hijacking qualities of these platforms.
*  You know, I spoke to Michael McEl who is the Utah Senator who was the sponsor of this
*  law.
*  And he said he was really, really concerned about a mental health crisis among youth in
*  the United States.
*  And he's a parent of two daughters.
*  And like many parents, he's following what's happening.
*  And he had read a report from the Centers for Disease Control that said that there was
*  high amount of depression, particularly among younger girls and suicidal thoughts in high
*  numbers, higher among young women than men.
*  And he feels that social media is playing a role in exacerbating this.
*  And so he wants to have parents have more involvement in social media to try to mitigate
*  what he sees as the harms.
*  And to be clear, this is not just a theoretical risk.
*  Correct me if I'm wrong.
*  There's a significant body of research that shows linkage between use of social media
*  and some of the conditions we just talked about, anxiety, depression.
*  There are a number of studies that link social media use by adolescents with mental health
*  issues.
*  And the strongest ones look at what they call problematic use of social media, which is
*  when young people are online for hours and hours on it and they feel withdrawal when they
*  stop.
*  And those have stronger correlations with mental health issues.
*  Got it.
*  So in that sense, the laws that were just passed and signed into law in Utah, they kind
*  of feel like some version of a parental fantasy come to life, right?
*  The government giving parents the option of essentially walling off these potentially
*  problematic platforms.
*  So I have to imagine many Utah parents perhaps welcomed these arguments and end this law.
*  I think they did.
*  Children are suffering from bullying on social media.
*  The Utah legislature held a hearing in January.
*  There are predators that are praying on them and trying to entice them away.
*  And there were parents who came and testified because they, like many people outside Utah,
*  feel overwhelmed by young people's use of these platforms.
*  We've just gotten to the point where this is a problem that parents don't have control
*  over anymore.
*  And they have concerns and they don't know how to deal with them.
*  And in a sense, this law is like a parent sitting on the shoulder of the kid.
*  And what about the opposition to this package of laws in Utah?
*  I have to imagine that it was equally intense.
*  The opposition was very intense.
*  The most intense came from tech industry trade groups that are funded by social media
*  and other platforms.
*  They objected to the age being 18 and under.
*  They felt like older teens do not need parental involvement.
*  They said it was a privacy problem for parents to have access to children's information.
*  They also argued that these companies have developed tools for parents.
*  Instagram has a number of tools that let parents, for example, set time limits for kids.
*  And TikTok has done things like turned off messages in the middle of the night.
*  And so the tech industry was arguing, they're already all these parental controls.
*  And yes, if there is diminished use of social media by 16 and 17-year-olds, that's very
*  prized advertising demographic.
*  So you can see that there are motivations both because they don't want the bureaucracy,
*  but second of all, they don't want anything chilling their revenue.
*  And then there were child development experts who argued that sometimes the students or
*  children or teens who are most in distress, who are going through emotional issues, identity
*  issues that they can't talk to their parents about, are the ones who most need to find support
*  and community online.
*  And then this might actually hinder them from getting the support they need, especially
*  if they were in a family that was uncomfortable or opposed to their views or if they were
*  an abusive family.
*  The child development expert argued that it would be very risky to allow those kind of
*  parents to see their children's social media posts.
*  Right.
*  I'm thinking of the example of a young person who's struggling with their sexuality and
*  wants to have conversations with kids going through a similar experience.
*  If a parent who disapproves of that sexual identity is suddenly peering in and under
*  of a law allowed to see every conversation, that's not going to be a place where that
*  kid gets to explore that issue, gets to go on any kind of journey with fellow kids.
*  Basically, it's a ruined place for exploration.
*  And it is one of the last places teens have, right?
*  Because there is a lot of surveillance at school, right?
*  There are apps that see what searches you make.
*  And so social media for some is the last refuge.
*  My name is Lucy Lone.
*  I'm 13 and I'm against a spill for a few reasons.
*  And we heard from young people in Utah who spoke about this idea.
*  My nerves won't be able to check in with friends who live out of state and family through social
*  media and see what they've been up to lately or talk to them often.
*  There was a 13 year old girl who talked about how this bill could end up cutting kids off
*  from their peers and making them feel more isolated.
*  And being that this is a bill only getting passed in Utah, Utah teens will feel very disconnected
*  from the world, which as a teenager can feel very frustrating and restricting.
*  It feels like the common thread within this opposition, which failed because this became
*  law, is not with the intent of the law, which is to make social media less problematic
*  for young people.
*  It's with the tactic, the sheer breath of this law and the feeling seems to be that it's
*  just went too far.
*  Absolutely.
*  I think no matter what part of the opposition you were on, they all felt that this law
*  was overly broad.
*  But Utah is only one place.
*  And we've already seen other places that have enacted laws that take a much more targeted
*  approach to the problem.
*  And they offer us a different, more targeted way of regulating this problem and even a different
*  way of conceiving of youth safety online.
*  We'll do it back.
*  So Natasha, what have these more targeted approaches that you just hinted at looked like
*  so far in trying to deal with social media and kids?
*  The targeted approaches take a different view.
*  While the Utah bill starts from thou shalt not, right?
*  It's prohibitive.
*  The more targeted approach looks at the structure of the social networks themselves.
*  And it is a kind of safety and privacy by design approach in which lawmakers elsewhere
*  are saying to the major tech platforms, you need to change the design.
*  So what do you think is the most important thing of your systems from the ground up to consider
*  the risks to children at every stage?
*  So give us examples of places and laws that do this thing you're describing.
*  I think there are two examples that are important here.
*  One is the United Kingdom which enacted protections for kids in 2021.
*  It was originally called the age appropriate design code.
*  But the notion is that safety and privacy for folks under 18 need to be baked in to every
*  feature that social media and other platforms that have children and youth on them use.
*  And that can be anything from, you know, there are these endless content streams that hijack
*  our attention.
*  And one of the arguments in the UK was, well, this endless scroll is really hard to stop,
*  especially if you're a young person.
*  And as this British law was going into effect, YouTube announced, first of all, that all
*  accounts for users age 13 to 17 would be private by default.
*  So they would not be public.
*  People couldn't see your videos.
*  And second of all, that they were turning off auto play by default for the youngest users.
*  Interesting.
*  And so the UK approach puts the responsibility on the companies to make the designs and the
*  features age appropriate for different ages of young people.
*  Right.
*  The idea here being that laws can make this technology better and safer for kids.
*  It doesn't have to, as you said, take it away entirely.
*  It can tinker and improve.
*  Yes.
*  I think we've seen that social media companies are reactive when people bring up problems,
*  but these laws, because they require fundamental changes by design, are trying to shift how
*  companies design new products and features to always consider younger people, because
*  kids and teens are on every platform, whether they're supposed to be there or not.
*  Right.
*  You would say that there were two important examples.
*  So what's the second?
*  The second is right here in the United States.
*  This California, which last September passed its own design code law to protect young people
*  online.
*  And among other things, it requires tech companies likely to have people under 18 as users
*  to turn on the highest privacy settings by default for those users and to turn off by
*  default any features that might put them at risk.
*  Right.
*  It imposes guardrails.
*  Exactly.
*  I mean, the way I think about the California law and even the UK law, they are product safety
*  laws like we have for cars, right?
*  Cars have to have seatbelts.
*  Cars have to have airbags.
*  And what these children's online safety laws are saying is that social media companies and
*  in California also gaming companies and others must have the equivalent of seatbelts and airbags
*  for minors online.
*  Whereas Utah's law, whereas Utah's law, right, is like kids can't drive the car unless
*  your parents say so.
*  Do we know if lawmakers in Utah ever considered these more targeted approaches that we're
*  talking about, the UK and California ones?
*  Well, there are some rules in the Utah bill that get at structural issues like the California
*  and UK laws.
*  There are rules that say that strangers should not be allowed to contact young people in
*  this Utah law.
*  But mainly this is a parental rights bill.
*  Right.
*  And it says kids can't go on these social media sites and have accounts without parental
*  permission and parents can have access to kids posts.
*  The Utah approach, it feels like fundamentally declares that social media is kind of irredeemable
*  when it comes to kids, right?
*  And it's so plagued with problems that cutting kids off entirely or requiring their parents
*  to op them in is the right answer.
*  And therefore, it seems to put less faith in the idea that these platforms can never get
*  better and be good for kids than what's happening in the UK and in California.
*  Does that feel right?
*  I think that the Utah law, in a way, puts social media in the same category as tobacco or
*  alcohol, right?
*  This is risky.
*  It's a controlled substance.
*  And so it basically says social media presents a huge risk and it needs to be controlled.
*  And parents need to be tightly involved and there needs to be age rules.
*  And I think that the California law has a California approach, which is the sky is
*  blue, we're optimistic, we are the technology state.
*  And we think that social media can have all kinds of benefits for kids.
*  And there is evidence that social media can be really beneficial for kids and for teens.
*  It can improve their sense of community and belonging and their quality of life and
*  it can decrease stress.
*  And so this California law is saying we're going to innovate structural changes that are
*  going to try to make these platforms safer for kids.
*  Got it.
*  What's one of the future of this sweeping landmark law in Utah?
*  Because it seems to raise two pretty obvious questions about its viability in the long
*  term.
*  And I think the first is, isn't it very likely to be challenged in court and isn't it
*  legally vulnerable to that challenge?
*  Yes, and yes.
*  So the concern is that the law could restrict the availability of information and stifle
*  important resources.
*  And so the thinking is that it could restrict access to content on social media that's
*  protected by the First Amendment.
*  Got it.
*  And the second question, of course, is even if this law does survive a legal challenge,
*  how enforceable are its restrictions in a world where children routinely outwit the parental
*  restrictions of almost every major technology that exists?
*  I mean, I remember as a kid lying to the websites that asked for my age, right?
*  All you have to do is scroll to the right year that you're supposed to have been born
*  to be the right age.
*  It was pretty easy to defeat.
*  So how is this Utah system supposed to work on a practical level that makes it not easily
*  work aroundable for digitally savvy kids?
*  So this law will require social media companies to verify the age of their users.
*  So you won't just be able to make up whatever age you want to be or whatever birth date
*  you want.
*  You will have to provide some kind of documentation.
*  And it will be up to Utah consumer protection to develop rules around this.
*  It could be that everybody on social media in Utah will have to provide their driver's
*  license or put five cents on their credit card or some other form of identity.
*  It does not have to be a government ID.
*  And yes, some kids may steal the driver's licenses out of their parents' wallets and
*  claim to be their parents.
*  Kids will find ways around it, but I think if they really institute this age verification,
*  then it will be much harder for younger kids to foil the law.
*  I'm curious how states beyond Utah are thinking about this landmark law.
*  And to the degree that they want to do something about minors and social media, whether they
*  are looking more to Utah as the model or the UK and California as the model.
*  So you have different states doing different things because you've got New York and New
*  Jersey and New Mexico and Maryland that have introduced laws that are similar to the California
*  law and the UK law.
*  And then you have Arkansas, which is introduced a bill that's similar to Utah, which requires
*  parental consent for minors.
*  And then you have Texas, which wants to go even further and is introduced a bill to ban
*  social media accounts for all minors.
*  Without even an opt-in function for parents.
*  Right.
*  It's like going to be like alcohol, no minors.
*  Wow.
*  And to me, the big question is what's going to happen at the federal level because even
*  from a tech industry standpoint, they don't want a patchwork of laws where in some states,
*  one thing and in another states, it's something else industries often want a national law
*  to standardize everything.
*  And parents want this too, right?
*  Parents are tearing their hair out and are worried about what their kids are doing online.
*  And I think many kids might want some of these rules like turning off access to social media
*  at night.
*  Right.
*  And so where do we think the federal solution might end up landing if there is a federal
*  solution?
*  And it'd be interesting to see if they meet in the middle because one of the remarkable
*  things is we know that we are in the middle of a virulent culture war where we have extreme
*  polar feelings.
*  And yet the protection and the concern about children and teens online is something that
*  everybody on both sides of the aisle is worried about parents and grandparents and even
*  teens themselves.
*  And I was talking to the senator in Utah who sponsored the bill we're talking about and
*  he's a Republican.
*  And he was saying that he listened to President Biden's state of the union.
*  And the president mentioned this.
*  The president said we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment
*  they're conducting on our children.
*  And then the president called for federal regulations to strengthen privacy protections
*  and other issues that could help protect kids online.
*  And so the state senator from Utah said he was listening to that and thinking he and
*  the president who have very different politics are on the same page.
*  So this might be one of those very rare issues that brings Republicans and Democrats together
*  in Congress as worried parents.
*  I think you're right.
*  I think there's a lot of good will here on both sides and I think that if there is a
*  child online safety bill that actually gets enacted by Congress, it is likely to have
*  elements of both of these different types of bills that we talked about.
*  It would be somewhere between we must have seatbelts and airbags and don't get into
*  the car at all.
*  Natasha, thank you very much.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need.
*  Senator Day.
*  On Sunday, President Biden approved the declaration of a major disaster in Mississippi after a powerful
*  tornado killed at least 26 people and nearly obliterated the town of Rolling Fork.
*  The tornado produced wingos of over 166 miles per hour that uprooted trees, shredded homes,
*  and reduced a fire station to a pile of rubble.
*  From what I've seen so far, it's surreal.
*  I've seen tornadoes hit throughout the nation, but to see this, to see the poems level and
*  businesses gone, it is unreal.
*  And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired his defense minister on Sunday, less
*  than a day after the minister called on Netanyahu to postpone a controversial plan to strengthen
*  his government's role in Israel's judiciary.
*  The defense minister, Yoav Galant, had warned that the plan was causing turmoil in Israel's
*  military and was therefore a threat to national security.
*  By firing him, Netanyahu signaled that he plans to proceed with the judicial overhaul,
*  despite widespread protests against it.
