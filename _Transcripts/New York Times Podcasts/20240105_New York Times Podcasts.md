# A Confusing New World for College Applicants
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLUN8WdnahI)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Last summer...
*  We begin tonight with the Supreme Court striking down affirmative action and reshaping college
*  admissions.
*  In a landmark ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned nearly 50 years of precedent and
*  banned the use of affirmative action in college admissions.
*  In a 6-3 decision, the justices ruled that Harvard University and the University of North
*  Carolina violated the Constitution.
*  In doing so, the court eliminated the single most powerful tool for ensuring diversity
*  on America's college campuses and forced college admissions officers and high school seniors
*  to figure out what the college admissions process should look like when race can no
*  longer be taken into account.
*  It's college application season, a stressful time for high school seniors and their parents.
*  But now, six months since affirmative action was repealed, things are even more uncertain
*  for many black students across the country.
*  Today, Daily producer Jessica Chung documents how, over the past year, both students and
*  college officials tried to navigate the new rules.
*  Friday, January 5th.
*  So this past July, just two weeks after the Supreme Court ended affirmative action, I
*  flew to Rochester, New York to meet some of the students who were part of this first historic
*  class to apply to college under an affirmative action ban.
*  Hello!
*  Hi there.
*  How's it going?
*  How are you all?
*  Good.
*  A group of about 90 high school seniors had also flown in from all across the country
*  to Nazareth University.
*  They were brought here by Peer Forward, a nonprofit that helps mostly black and Hispanic
*  students from low-income communities apply to college.
*  And they had gathered here for a workshop on how to make their college essay stand out.
*  We're going in now.
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  I ran into a small classroom with an instructor and five seniors who were sitting facing a
*  whiteboard scribbling into their spiral notebooks with tips on how to write the perfect college essay.
*  We're envisioning that no one else know who you are.
*  Hundreds of students.
*  They never met you.
*  They cannot see who you are.
*  So what makes you different?
*  The college essay is a high-stakes genre of writing that is supposed to capture everything
*  a 17-year-old is and was and everything he or she could offer to the college of their dreams.
*  Starting an essay strong.
*  And with that high-stakes genre are rules.
*  Rules about what to do.
*  That's a good thing that he just said a hook.
*  Write a hook.
*  What exactly do we mean by show and tell?
*  Show don't tell.
*  You guys remember when we were in third or fourth grade, we would have to bring an animal
*  in and we would have to do what?
*  Well, some schools had to bring an animal.
*  But you had to bring something in.
*  And rules about what not to do.
*  Many of the students told me about certain edicts around the college essay.
*  Don't write a sob story.
*  No COVID.
*  No dying grandparents.
*  These are topics that won't set you apart from the batch.
*  How can we help?
*  What are some words we should be using to help the reader visualize what we're saying?
*  But what about an applicant's race?
*  Historically, race could offer an edge to these students.
*  But in its ruling banning affirmative action, the Supreme Court said that colleges couldn't
*  do that anymore.
*  Using race as a factor in admissions is no longer legal.
*  And to play it safe, many of the schools these kids are applying to have decided to hide
*  what they call the race box.
*  Which means that while students might still check the box that corresponds with the race,
*  the schools will be blind to it.
*  So unlike any other applicants before them, this year's class of high school seniors
*  face a new dilemma.
*  With the race box gone, the question becomes, should students write about race, or should
*  they avoid it altogether?
*  And could writing about race actually work against them?
*  I think that was an awesome job.
*  So tomorrow...
*  But by the end of the session, the instructor never brought any of this up.
*  Hi guys.
*  I'm Jess.
*  So during their lunch break, I walked into the dining hall to ask students of color how
*  they were all thinking about this.
*  I was wondering...
*  Oh, thank you.
*  I walked over to a table strewn with pizza crusts and leftover french fries.
*  And at that table, I met two kids sitting next to each other.
*  Her name tags read Jordan Williams and Francesco Macias from the Bronx.
*  Some clubs I'm in is peer ministers, drama, matra.
*  Jordan told me he wants to be a corporate lawyer, and Francesco wants to be an electrical
*  engineer.
*  I've been really fascinated in electronics and how they work.
*  I really like to build stuff.
*  I like to design things for things.
*  Have you designed anything?
*  I made a mini Tesla coil.
*  A what?
*  He patiently explained to me that a Tesla coil is a tightly bound coil of wires that
*  can produce a spark.
*  He made it for his eighth grade science fair.
*  I was watching this documentary on Nikola Tesla.
*  And I saw it and I was like, hmm, maybe some people made a miniature model.
*  Francesco comes by his passion pretty naturally.
*  I was born here, but my parents are from Ecuador.
*  When his grandfather emigrated from Ecuador in the 1960s, he settled in Queens, doing
*  laundry at a hospital.
*  Francesco's dad grew up there and eventually became a technician for buildings around the
*  city.
*  So Francesco grew up tinkering and building stuff with his dad.
*  At one point, they built a computer he found on the sidewalk using spare parts from other
*  computers that were thrown away.
*  I guess it's just really affected my life.
*  When Francesco was 12, he started watching YouTube videos of engineers exploding coke
*  bottles and making roving hoverboards.
*  And when he looked at where many of these engineers went to college, time and again,
*  he saw one name.
*  MIT.
*  And that became his dream.
*  I really love engineering.
*  Francesco did everything right to make himself an attractive candidate.
*  He has a 4.0 and he has more extracurricular activities than he can possibly list on the
*  Common Application, which includes student body vice president, engineering club, community
*  service, woodworking, school theater, and he's a third degree black belt in Taekwondo.
*  But his test scores are lower than MIT's average.
*  And now he thinks the Supreme Court's decision on affirmative action won't give him the
*  boost normally given to Latino students like him.
*  I've been taking up the race, which I don't have that much of an upper hand.
*  With MIT's acceptance rate at just 4.8%, losing this upper hand feels like a big loss.
*  And so other parts of his application are rising to a new level of importance.
*  Most crucially, his essay.
*  So I'm going to have to write something that is about me.
*  He told me he's writing about his leather briefcase.
*  Because I found that bag at like a thrift store for $10.
*  That helped him conquer his shyness, helped him gain confidence and make friends.
*  But he was struggling with whether or not his story should include his race.
*  Do you think that you might consider working in your racial identity to your essay now
*  that you know that the box is gone?
*  I don't know.
*  Because on one part, it's like I can show who I am more.
*  But on the other hand, I don't want to sound too redundant.
*  And then it's like, it's kind of like when they tell you like, don't write about a sob
*  story because they read a sob story all the time.
*  I just want to write about me, myself.
*  And you don't want to talk about it?
*  Not really.
*  Why?
*  Because although, yeah, it's a part of my identity, but I don't really let it define
*  me in a sense.
*  So it's one of these things.
*  I mean, I'll ask questions from my other peers and the advisors to see what to do.
*  It is confusing, especially because other generations...
*  Jordan, the aspiring corporate lawyer, was sitting next to us, quietly listening this
*  whole time.
*  What did you write about?
*  I asked what was in his essay so far.
*  I wrote about one of my favorite movies and I related it to my life.
*  What's the movie?
*  Training Day.
*  He said the movie Training Day taught him to question conventional wisdom.
*  I always felt like there's a lot of pressure to follow in with the crowd.
*  But if you question why am I following this crowd when I can stand out myself?
*  So that's why I wrote about it.
*  Jordan told me more about himself.
*  He could have written about a lot of things.
*  As a black kid raised by a single mom, he knew his biological dad.
*  But his dad chose not to be an active part in Jordan's life.
*  And so he would get himself into trouble, succumbing to peer pressure.
*  But his grandfather encouraged him to set his own course in life and focus on school.
*  And now he's an honor roll student.
*  But none of that was in his Training Day essay.
*  No, not apparent in my essay at all.
*  Not apparent in my essay at all.
*  Would you consider working it in your essay?
*  Now I'm black?
*  Uh, now I don't think about it, yeah.
*  How would you do that?
*  I don't even know.
*  I don't even know.
*  That's, uh, I would probably have to like say that I'm a black kid from the Bronx, I guess.
*  I don't know.
*  That's crazy.
*  I didn't even think about that.
*  I'm sorry.
*  It's weird.
*  It's a weird situation.
*  Francesco and Jordan weren't the only ones confused.
*  As I talked to more students at the workshop, it was clear that the confusion over the ruling
*  was everywhere.
*  I am not really too educated on like what's happening in the government right now.
*  I don't really know what's going on.
*  They told me they were worried and uncertain of what it meant for them.
*  I was just like, damn, it's not going to help me, I guess.
*  It's not going to help you.
*  Because I was kind of hoping it would.
*  One of my essays were actually like surrounded by like my identity, my culture, being black
*  and like Nigerian.
*  And I feel like now that affirmations going on in colleges can actually say, well, you
*  don't really care about like your identity now.
*  And there was panic.
*  Over the news, it was being shared on Instagram.
*  It says here like in Missouri, the Attorney General directed all colleges to at least
*  stop considering race and scholarships.
*  About how the University of Missouri and the University of Kentucky would go beyond the
*  ruling and end race based scholarships.
*  Some of my peers saying, now I can't apply to this school or I have to change this option.
*  And in the absence of answers, some were making up their own, sometimes wrongly.
*  You think that students might redact that they were part of like NAACP?
*  Yes.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And so it's leading some students to hide their race.
*  So it was a plus before.
*  Now you feel like it's a minus to be black.
*  In the fear of that's too race related.
*  So now you're hiding that side of yourself to make others feel better in a way.
*  And with all of this misinformation floating around.
*  Lunch is over.
*  Okay.
*  Thanks.
*  You're welcome.
*  Have a good next session.
*  You too.
*  Thank you.
*  These questions and confusions eventually made their way inside the classroom.
*  Why is it that?
*  Into the next session.
*  When two students sparred over, if you don't indicate your race in your essay, would colleges
*  know at all?
*  When you fill out FAFSA, you still have to answer the race questions.
*  It's not going to be just out of the question entirely.
*  Not like race isn't a question at all.
*  And if you apply for financial aid, as students said, they would know.
*  Wouldn't they?
*  But then now the concern comes in is will they tackle that as well?
*  And if the schools knew their race, what would they do with that information?
*  There was a pause.
*  I waited for the adults in the room to give some sort of answer.
*  So we're going to, we're in our second session.
*  But no.
*  The writing coach gently guided their attention back to class.
*  Let's make sure that we're being attentive.
*  We want to be an active listener.
*  I eventually looked into this and the schools in fact wouldn't know a student's race from
*  financial aid forms.
*  But no one at the workshop told the kids this.
*  So the writing workshop continued business as usual.
*  Between classes, I had asked the head of Peerford, which is guiding all these kids, how their
*  guidance would change as a result of the affirmative action ban.
*  He said it doesn't.
*  He told me they were still waiting to hear more from colleges themselves about how the
*  ruling might change their admissions formula.
*  So after the workshop, I started reaching out to those admissions offices.
*  And it turns out the people charged with implementing the court's decision are just as confused
*  as the students applying.
*  We'll be right back.
*  After my trip to the writing workshop in Rochester, I wanted to get a better understanding
*  of how admissions offices around the country were going to change.
*  Out of the thousands of universities and colleges in the U.S., a small percentage, some put
*  the number around 10%, are actually affected by the decision.
*  The ones who are practicing affirmative action in the first place.
*  But the small percentage are the most selective in the United States.
*  Think the top 100 colleges in the U.S. News and World Report.
*  Colleges that are known for their outsize ability to help students from poor backgrounds
*  become high earners after graduation.
*  So these were the colleges I started to call.
*  Hi, how's it going?
*  Hey, Jeff, how are you?
*  Good, how are you?
*  Hey, Jeff.
*  Hi, how are you?
*  Gary, thank you so much for taking the time to talk.
*  How are you doing today?
*  I called over 30 people inside the admissions world.
*  So we're still trying to understand, you know, I would say the ruling specifically
*  for Carleton and we're working with our legal counsel to ask some of these specific questions.
*  Some admissions offices never responded to my requests.
*  Some admissions offices wanted to talk, but were vetoed by their general counsel.
*  Some would only talk to me off the record.
*  A college can be sued for many, many reasons in a time when there's a substantial movement
*  in the United States that seems to be reacting against even a mere idea of diversity.
*  And that's because colleges are treading this new terrain cautiously.
*  No school wants to end up in the legal battle like Harvard did, who was the defendant on
*  the case that led to the overturning of affirmative action.
*  The trial unearthed embarrassing discoveries about Harvard's notoriously opaque admissions
*  system, including something called a personal score, which admissions officers use to rank
*  traits like an applicant's self-confidence and likeability, and routinely scored Asian
*  applicants near the bottom.
*  And Harvard is still being investigated for its admission practices.
*  But the other admissions officers that did talk to me started to give me a sense of what
*  it's like inside the schools.
*  Hey, Matt.
*  Hello, hello.
*  Matt McGann is the Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid at Amherst College, a small
*  liberal arts college in Massachusetts.
*  It has an acceptance rate of 7%.
*  Because we do want to attract a diverse applicant pool, we do believe that a diverse student
*  body makes for a better residential liberal arts education.
*  Currently, about half of its student body are students of color.
*  Even before this decision, race was never by itself the reason why someone would be
*  admitted.
*  McGann told me that before the ruling, Amherst achieved this diverse student body in part
*  by considering race among a variety of factors.
*  Do you play a sport?
*  Do you play the French horn?
*  Did you grow up white and on a farm or black in an inner city?
*  Race was just one piece of the puzzle.
*  It was always one of many parts of a whole person review to better understand a student's
*  context, to better understand a student's life, but never it by itself, never a determining
*  factor.
*  What McGann told me is something I heard from every admissions office I talked to.
*  That race by itself is not determinative.
*  But the Supreme Court disagreed, saying that race was determinative for a significant percentage
*  of admitted black and Hispanic students at Harvard and UNC.
*  And now places like Amherst have lost their ability to consider race.
*  We're going from a time where we can consider everything that a student wants us to consider
*  to there being one aspect that remains important in society that we must ignore.
*  When the affirmative action cases got to the Supreme Court's door, McGann, along with
*  many administrators at Amherst, sent an amicus brief to the court and predicted that without
*  affirmative action, the number of black students on their campuses will drop from 7% to 2%.
*  I don't have a law degree, although the longer I do this, I feel like my legal expertise
*  certainly is increasing.
*  And after the court's ruling, McGann and his team at Amherst pored over the decision, which
*  came in the form of a 237-page PDF.
*  We didn't get the chance to ask the Supreme Court, like, right, so we do this, so what
*  now?
*  It's not a step-by-step manual, so we're left with the work to figure out how we make
*  sure that we're in compliance with everything.
*  But what does being in compliance mean exactly?
*  Unlike with sports, orchestra, and geographic status, race is now off the table.
*  But what if participating in an extracurricular, like the Black Student Union, has to do with
*  race?
*  How would that work?
*  And so just to get specific, like with an extracurricular activity, for instance, where
*  a student says that they were a member of the BSU, how could that have been considered
*  before the affirmative action ruling and what changes about it after?
*  So that cannot be put in the context of...
*  Well...
*  So understanding a student's participation in an activity through a lens of racial status
*  is something that, at the very least, cannot be as easily done anymore.
*  We're still working on our training and guideline language on how the admissions staff should
*  approach these questions.
*  We're still working on that.
*  All right.
*  Well, thank you so much for your time and good luck with the next admissions cycle.
*  And again, thank you for the time.
*  It's been an interesting conversation and I appreciate your thoughtful approach to it.
*  So best wishes.
*  Thanks, Chris.
*  Bye.
*  Ladina Amherst isn't the only one scratching his head over this ruling.
*  In several on and off the record conversations with current and former deans of admissions,
*  they expressed tremendous uncertainty about how all of this was going to work, how you
*  not consider a race when it can be so apparent in things like a student's extracurriculars,
*  their last name, their essay topic.
*  But as I continued to talk to admissions officers, I finally started to get somewhere.
*  They seemed to all point to a key passage in the decision that was in this moment of
*  darkness, a kind of North Star.
*  Chief Justice Roberts wrote it and it goes, nothing in this opinion should be construed
*  as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant's discussion of how race affected
*  his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise.
*  But he says, a benefit to a student who overcame racial discrimination, for example, must be
*  tied to that student's courage and determination.
*  Or a benefit to a student whose heritage or culture motivated him or her to assume a
*  leadership role or attain a particular goal must be tied to that student's unique ability
*  to contribute to the university.
*  In other words, the student must be treated on the basis of his or her experiences as an
*  individual, not on the basis of race.
*  So what does that mean?
*  Roberts says that if a student does write about race, you as the admissions officer
*  will now have to connect race to a lived experience, like overcoming discrimination.
*  Then you'd have to explain how overcoming discrimination uniquely connects to the mission
*  of the college, like how overcoming discrimination shows resilience and promise.
*  And these are the students that we're looking for.
*  The distinctions between race and race as a lived experience is a granular distinction,
*  and I wasn't sure how it would play out.
*  But by the fall, as colleges launched their applications on the Common App,
*  I began to notice a new kind of essay question pop up.
*  Over and over again, I kept seeing schools introduce new supplemental essay prompts
*  that draw words directly from Roberts' passage.
*  Prompts like, talk about lived experiences and how you could uniquely contribute to their campus.
*  It was a subtle change, but a change nonetheless.
*  For example, Brown University used to ask its applicants to write, quote,
*  about a time when you were challenged by a perspective that differed from your own.
*  Here, it allowed applicants to argue that by simply belonging to a minority group,
*  other students can learn from them and vice versa.
*  It relied on a previous Supreme Court precedent that says colleges can use affirmative action
*  to create a diverse learning environment.
*  But after the overturning of that precedent, Brown replaced it with a new prompt this year,
*  with words drawn directly from Roberts.
*  It read, share how an aspect of your growing up has inspired or challenged you,
*  and what unique contributions this might allow you to make to the Brown community.
*  The key change here is that there is now a right kind of race essay and a wrong kind.
*  And in the end, I found that at least 20 selective colleges,
*  including several in the Ivy League, had changed their essay questions this year,
*  using words from Roberts passage.
*  But the students this year will have a hard time understanding this distinction on their own.
*  The plaintiffs will look at any institution that doesn't see a dip and wonder,
*  were you like wink wink using a proxy, but really going against the law?
*  So, you know, I want to be really clear and I would want you to print that Colorado College
*  is going to follow the law. I know that it's an optimistic goal to try to maintain compositional
*  diversity. And we probably won't, to be honest with you, but I don't want to set a goal that
*  we will. You know, we've got to set aspirational goals. But you're right, that our numbers probably
*  will decline. In my conversations with admissions deans, they told me their schools were still
*  committed to diversity. But the schools are in a bit of a bind. If they produce the same level
*  of racial diversity in the incoming year as the year before the ruling, they put themselves at
*  legal risk. The anti-affirmative action opposition are on the lookout for schools that, behind the
*  closed doors of admissions offices, are practicing a kind of under the table affirmative action.
*  I talked to Jeff Brunzel, who was the dean of admissions at Yale, but is now working with
*  Morehouse College to figure out what this new world of admissions is starting to look like.
*  He crunched the numbers. He estimates that there will be a 20 to 30 percent drop in black
*  enrollment in the top 100 colleges. He says he expects HBCUs, like Morehouse, to catch some of
*  those 20 to 30 percent. But it's unclear how many of those students those colleges can actually
*  support. And as for Latino students, no one I talked to has speculated on where they might wind up.
*  I asked McGann at Amherst, given all of this, whether students of color applying this year
*  will have a harder time getting into schools. Schools like Amherst.
*  I would hope that that student would know that nothing about this changes who they are.
*  And it's incumbent upon colleges. It's not the student's job. The student should present themselves
*  as wholly and fully and as best they can. And it's on the colleges to lawfully consider
*  and have an admission process that allows them to live up to their mission.
*  Okay, I have it on the recording thing.
*  Okay, great. And you're holding it to your ear like you're on the phone.
*  Just weeks before Francesco submitted his application to MIT, I called him after school.
*  To start, I would just love to know how you're feeling about the applications you have so far.
*  Oh, I really like it. I feel that it speaks to who I am.
*  I wanted to know where he landed, whether he ended up mentioning race in his application essay.
*  I don't think I did. I did try to stay away from it.
*  He says even though race is still a big part of who he is,
*  it's not the thing he wants admissions officers to see.
*  I don't want to be categorized saying, oh, he's an Hispanic. Then saying like, oh, look at what
*  he's done. He's done this. He's done that. I was actually speaking to one of my friends about it.
*  We were saying it's essentially being like, I guess confined to like a box.
*  That's like, oh, what race are you? Like Hispanic, right? And I've tried for my races.
*  I'm not saying like, oh, I'm ashamed, but specifically pertaining to college application,
*  I want to show them who I am as a person. What my dreams are, what I like, what are my aspirations,
*  who I am. When you think about someone boxing you in
*  because they know your racial background, what do you think that boxing in is or what do you think
*  that boxing in means? Yeah, I want to be confined by saying, oh, they have this preconceived notion
*  of me being Hispanic. Okay. And I don't know their attitudes or their feelings, but
*  whether I like it or not, there are people in the world who don't
*  like my race or just they have different opinions. And that's okay. People
*  have their right to have their own opinions, but I want to go in saying who I am. So if I ever were
*  to be confined in that box, essentially an issue for me. It's a way to play safe. Yeah, just play
*  it safe. You know, in a world where affirmative action was still practiced by colleges and by
*  admissions officers, where it would actually be a favor to you. Would you have mentioned
*  your racial background? If it were an advantage to me, then I'd take it. But now that it's gone,
*  I'd rather play it safe. His decision is fueled in part by the same narrative I heard from the
*  other students at the workshop six months ago, which is this feeling of increasing distrust.
*  Francesco knew that affirmative action guaranteed that his race could only help him. But now that
*  that protection is gone, he's worried that the discrimination he sees everywhere else in the world
*  could now enter the admissions process. Because at the end of the day, the world is not a kind place
*  as much as I don't like it. I got to deal with it, especially heading into the adult world.
*  It's kind of scary and confusing. But I'm also trying to keep an open mind and just figure my
*  way out through this world, this new world I'm entering. A few weeks ago, I met up with Jordan,
*  who if you remember, was working on his essay on the movie Training Day. He ended up scrapping
*  that all together. He said he thought more about the court's ruling. And unlike Francesco, he
*  decided he would not only mention his race, but he was going to dedicate the topic of his essay
*  to his identity. About growing up as a black kid in the Bronx, he said. If the Supreme Court
*  ruling says race doesn't matter, he's saying race matters to me. And this is how.
*  And that's the choice a generation of 17 year olds is having to make in a moment as formative
*  as applying to college. Do they choose to define themselves by their race like Jordan? Or do they
*  hide their race like Francesco? And while that choice may or may not mean the difference
*  between getting in and not, it will almost certainly shape
*  how they see themselves and how they think the world sees them.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for
*  the bombing attack that killed 84 people in Iran on Wednesday, a claim that, according to the Times,
*  aligns with an intelligence assessment by American officials. The claim is significant because some
*  Iranian leaders had initially sought to blame Israel for the attack, raising fears that Israel's
*  war in Gaza could widen into a regional conflict. Now that ISIS has said it was responsible,
*  that possibility seems less likely. And new documents released by Congressional Democrats
*  show that during Donald Trump's presidency, his businesses received at least 7.8 million dollars
*  from 20 foreign governments, most of it from China. The transactions offer concrete evidence
*  that Trump engaged in the kind of conduct that congressional Republicans alleged that President
*  Biden did, as they try, so far without success, to build a case for impeaching him.
