*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Babaro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Last summer, we begin tonight with a Supreme Court striking down affirmative action and
*  reshaping college admissions.
*  In a landmark ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned nearly 50 years of precedent and
*  banned the use of affirmative action in college admissions.
*  In a 6-3 decision, the Justice's rule that Harvard University and the University of
*  North Carolina violated the Constitution.
*  In doing so, the Court eliminated the single most powerful tool for ensuring diversity
*  on America's college campuses and forced college admissions officers and high school seniors
*  to figure out what the college admissions process should look like when race can no longer
*  be taken into account.
*  This college application season is stressful time for high school seniors and their parents.
*  But now, six months since affirmative action was repealed, things are even more uncertain
*  for many black students across the country.
*  Today, Daily Producer Jessica Chung documents how over the past year, both students and
*  college officials tried to navigate the new rules.
*  It's Friday, January 5th.
*  So this past July, just two weeks after the Supreme Court ended affirmative action, I flew
*  to Rochester, New York.
*  To meet some of the students, we're part of this first historic class to apply to college
*  under an affirmative action band.
*  Hello.
*  Hi there.
*  How's it going?
*  I'm good.
*  I'm good.
*  I'm good.
*  The group of about 90 high school seniors had also flown in from all across the country
*  to Nazareth University.
*  They were brought here by peer forward, nonprofit that helps mostly black and Hispanic students
*  from low income communities apply to college.
*  And they had gathered here for a workshop on how to make their college essay stand out.
*  Falling in now.
*  Okay.
*  We're moved into a small classroom with an instructor and five seniors who are sitting
*  facing a white board, scribbling into their spiral notebooks with tips on how to write
*  the perfect college essay.
*  We're envisioning that no one else know who you are.
*  Hundreds of students, they never met you, they cannot see who you are.
*  So what makes you different?
*  The college essay is a high-sleeve genre of writing that is supposed to capture everything
*  you 17 year old is and was and everything he or she could offer to the college of their
*  dreams.
*  Starting an essay strong.
*  And with that high-stay genre, our rules.
*  Rules about what to do.
*  That's a good thing that he just set a hook.
*  Write a hook.
*  What exactly do we mean by show and tell?
*  Show don't tell.
*  You guys remember when we were in third or fourth grade, we would have to bring an animal
*  in and we would have to do what some schools had to bring in.
*  But you had to break something in.
*  And rules about what not to do.
*  Many of the students told me about certain edicts around the college essay.
*  Don't write a sob story.
*  No COVID.
*  No dying grandparents.
*  These are topics that won't set you apart from the batch.
*  How can we help?
*  What are some words we should be using to help the reader visualize what we're saying?
*  But what about an applicant's race?
*  Historically, race could offer an edge to these students.
*  But in its ruling banning affirmative action, the Supreme Court said that colleges couldn't
*  do that anymore.
*  Using race as a factor in missions is no longer legal.
*  And to play it safe, many of the schools these kids are applying to have decided to hide
*  what they call the race box.
*  Which means that while students might still check the box that corresponds to the race,
*  the schools will be blind to it.
*  So unlike any other applicants before them, this year's class of high school seniors face
*  a new dilemma.
*  With the race box gone, the question becomes, should students write about race?
*  Or should they avoid it altogether?
*  And could writing about race actually work against them?
*  I think that was an awesome job.
*  So tomorrow.
*  But by the end of the session, the instructor never brought any of this up.
*  Hi guys.
*  I'm Jess.
*  So during their lunch break, I walked into the dining hall to ask students of color how
*  they were all thinking about this.
*  I was wondering, oh thank you.
*  I walked over to a table, strewn with pizza crusts, and left over french fries.
*  And at that table, I met two kids sitting next to each other.
*  Her name tags read Jordan Williams and Francesco Macias from the Bronx.
*  Some of the clubs I'm in is here, Ministers, Drama, Montreux.
*  Jordan told me he wants to be a corporate lawyer.
*  And Francesco wants to be an electrical engineer.
*  Because I was really fascinated in electronics and how they worked.
*  I really like to build stuff.
*  I like to design things for things.
*  Have you designed anything?
*  I made a mini Tesla coil.
*  Oh what?
*  He patiently explained to me that a Tesla coil is a tightly bound coil of wires that can
*  produce the spark.
*  He made it for his eighth grade science fair.
*  I was watching this documentary on Nikola Tesla.
*  And I saw it on tape.
*  Maybe some people made a miniature model.
*  Francesco comes by his passion pretty naturally.
*  I was born here by my parents on the people.
*  When his grandfather emigrated from Ecuador in the 1960s, he settled in Queens, doing laundry
*  at a hospital.
*  Francesco's dad grew up there and eventually became a technician for buildings around
*  the city.
*  So Francesco grew up tinkering and building stuff with his dad.
*  At one point, they built a computer he found on the sidewalk, using spare parts from
*  other computers that were thrown away.
*  I guess it's just really affected my life.
*  When Francesco was 12, he started watching YouTube videos of engineers exploding coke bottles
*  and making roving hoverboards.
*  And when he looked at where many of these engineers went to college, time and again, he saw
*  one name, MIT.
*  And that became his dream.
*  I really love engineering.
*  Francesco did everything right to make himself an attractive candidate.
*  He's a 4.0 and he has more extracurricular activities than he can possibly list on the
*  common application, which includes student body vice president, engineering club, community
*  service, woodworking, school theater, and he's a third degree black belt in Taekwondo.
*  But his test scores are lower than MIT's average.
*  And now he thinks the Supreme Court's decision on affirmative action won't give him the
*  boost normally given to Latino students like him.
*  Not that taken on the race, which I don't have that much of an upper hand.
*  With MIT's acceptance rate at just 4.8%, losing this upper hand feels like a big loss.
*  And so other parts of his application are rising to a new level of importance, most crucially
*  his essay.
*  So I'm going to have to write something that is about me.
*  He told me he's writing about his leather briefcase.
*  I found that bag at like a thrift store for $10.
*  That helped him conquer his shyness, helped him gain confidence, and make friends.
*  But he was struggling with whether or not his story should include his race.
*  Do you think that you might consider working in your racial identity to your essay now that
*  you know that the box is gone?
*  I don't know.
*  Because I'm one part of it.
*  It's like I can show who I am.
*  More.
*  Well, on the other hand.
*  I don't want to sound too redundant.
*  It's like when they tell you don't write about a sob story because they read a sob story
*  all the time.
*  I just want to write about me myself.
*  And you don't want to talk about it?
*  Not really.
*  Why?
*  Because.
*  Although, yeah, it's a part of my identity, but I don't really let it.
*  I mean, in a sense.
*  So it's one of these things.
*  I mean, all questions from other peers and the advisors see what to do.
*  It is confusing, especially because of the two generations.
*  Jordan, the aspiring corporate lawyer, was sitting next to us, quietly listening this
*  whole time.
*  Um, what'd you write about?
*  I asked what was in his essay so far.
*  I've got about one of my favorite movies I've related it to in my life.
*  What's the movie?
*  Training Day.
*  He said the movie Training Day taught him the question conventional wisdom.
*  I always felt like there's a lot of pressure.
*  It's a foul in the crowd, but if you question, why am I following you just crowd when I can
*  stand out myself?
*  So that's why I wrote about it.
*  Jordan told me more about himself.
*  He could have written about a lot of things.
*  As a black kid raised by a single mom, he knew his biological dad, but his dad chose not
*  to be an active part in Jordan's life.
*  And so he would get himself into trouble, succumbing to peer pressure.
*  But his grandfather encouraged him to set his own course in life and focus on school.
*  And now he's an honor roll student.
*  But none of that was in his training day essay.
*  No, not appearing in my essay at all.
*  I'm appearing to myself.
*  Would you consider working it in your essay?
*  I'm black.
*  Uh, now I don't think about it yet.
*  How would you do that?
*  I don't even know.
*  I don't even know.
*  I would probably have to say that I'm a black kid from the Bronx, I guess.
*  I don't know.
*  That's crazy.
*  I didn't even think about it.
*  It's weird.
*  It's a weird situation.
*  Francesco and Jordan weren't the only ones confused.
*  Because I talked to more students at the workshop, it was clear that the confusion over the
*  ruling was everywhere.
*  I am not really too educated on what's happening in the government right now.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't really know what's going on.
*  They told me they were worried and uncertain of what it meant for them.
*  I was just like them.
*  I guess.
*  It's not going to help me, I guess.
*  It's not going to help you.
*  Because I was kind of hoping it wouldn't.
*  But one of my essays were actually around about my dancing, my culture, being black and
*  like Nigerian.
*  And I feel like now that a firm that actually gone college can actually say, well, you don't
*  really care about like you're a deaf and you know.
*  And there was panic.
*  Over news, it was being shared on Instagram.
*  It says here like in Missouri, in a tiny general direct to all colleges, to be at least
*  not considering race and scholarships.
*  About how the University of Missouri and the University of Kentucky would go beyond
*  the ruling and end race-based scholarships.
*  Some of my peers saying, now I can apply to this school or now I have to change this
*  option.
*  And in the absence of answers, some were making up their own.
*  Sometimes wrongly.
*  You think that students might redact that they were part of like NAACP and.
*  Yes.
*  Oh wow.
*  And so it's leading some students to hide their race.
*  So it was a plus before.
*  Now you feel like it's a minus.
*  Yes.
*  In the fear of that's too race related.
*  So now you're hiding that side of yourself to make others feel better in a way.
*  And with all of this misinformation floating around.
*  Lunch is over.
*  Okay.
*  Thanks.
*  You all know.
*  Have a good accession.
*  You too.
*  I mean, thank you.
*  These questions and confusions eventually made their way inside the classroom.
*  Why is it bad?
*  Into the next session.
*  When two students sparred over, if you don't indicate your race in your essay, would colleges
*  know at all?
*  When you fill out fast, but you still have to enter the race questions.
*  It's not going to be just out of the question entirely.
*  Not like races in a question at all.
*  And if you apply for financial aid, as students said, they would know.
*  When they.
*  But then now the concern comes in is will they topple that as well?
*  Because they're already having.
*  And if the schools knew their race, what would they do with that information?
*  There was a pause.
*  I waited for the adults in the room to give some sort of answer.
*  So we're going to wear in our second session.
*  But no.
*  The writing coach gently guided their attention back to class.
*  Let's make sure that we're being attentive.
*  We want to get active listener.
*  I eventually looked into this.
*  And the schools in fact wouldn't know what students raised from financial aid forms.
*  But no one at the workshop told the kids this.
*  So the writing workshop continued business as usual.
*  Between classes, I had asked the head of peer forward, which is guiding all these kids,
*  how their guidance would change as a result of the affirmative action ban.
*  He said it doesn't.
*  He told me they were still waiting to hear more from colleges themselves, but how the ruling
*  might change their admissions formula.
*  So after the workshop, I started reaching out to those admissions offices.
*  And it turns out the people charged with implementing the court's decision are just
*  as confused as the students applying.
*  We'll be right back.
*  After my trip to the writing workshop in Rochester, I wanted to get a better understanding
*  of how admissions offices around the country are going to change.
*  Out of the thousands of universities and colleges in the US, a small percentage, some put the
*  number around 10 percent, are actually affected by the decision.
*  The ones who are practicing affirmative action in the first place.
*  But the small percentage are the most selective in the United States.
*  Think the top 100 colleges in the US News and World Report.
*  These are the colleges that are known for their outsizability to help students from poor
*  backgrounds become high earners after graduation.
*  So these were the colleges.
*  I started to call.
*  Hi, how's it going?
*  Hey Jeff, how are you?
*  Good, how are you?
*  Hey Jeff, how are you?
*  Gary, thank you so much for taking the time to talk.
*  How are you doing today?
*  I called over 30 people inside the admissions world.
*  So we still kind of understand, you know, I would say the ruling specifically for Carlton
*  and working with our legal counsel to ask them any specific questions.
*  Some admissions offices never responded to my requests.
*  Some admissions offices wanted to talk, but were vetoed by their general counsel.
*  Some would only talk to me off the record.
*  The college can be sued for many, many reasons in a time when there's a substantial movement
*  in the United States that seems to be reacting against even the mere idea of diversity.
*  And that's because colleges are treading this new terrain cautiously.
*  No school wants to end up in the legal battle like Harvard did, with the defendant on the case
*  that led to the overturning of affirmative action.
*  The trial on earth embarrassing discoveries about Harvard's notoriously opaque admission
*  system, including something called a personal score, which admissions officers used to rank
*  traits like an applicant's self-confidence and likeability, and routinely scored Asian
*  applicants near the bottom.
*  And Harvard is still being investigated for its mission practices.
*  But the other admissions officers that did talk to me started to give me a sense of what
*  it's like inside the schools.
*  Hey Matt.
*  Hello, hello.
*  Matt McGann is the Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid at Amherst College, a small liberal arts
*  college in Massachusetts.
*  It has an acceptance rate of 7%.
*  Because we do want to attract a diverse applicant pool, we do believe that a diverse student
*  body makes for a better residential liberal arts education.
*  Currently, about half of its student body are students of color.
*  Even before this decision, race was never by itself the reason why someone would be admitted.
*  McGann told me that before the ruling, Amherst achieved this diverse student body in part
*  by considering race among a variety of factors.
*  Do you play a sport?
*  Do you play the French horn?
*  Did you grow up white and on a farm or black in an inner city?
*  Race was just one piece of the puzzle.
*  It was always one of many parts of a whole person review to better understand a student's
*  context, to better understand a student's life, but never it by itself never a determining
*  factor.
*  What McGann told me is something I heard from every admissions office I talked to.
*  That race by itself was not determinative.
*  But the Supreme Court's agreed saying that race was determinative for a significant percentage
*  of admitted black and Hispanic students at Harvard and UNC.
*  And now places like Amherst have lost her ability to consider race.
*  We're going from a time where we can consider everything that a student wants us to consider
*  to there being one aspect that remains important in society that we must ignore.
*  When the affirmative action cases got to the Supreme Court's door, McGann, along with many
*  administrators at Amherst, sent an amicus brief to the court and predicted that without
*  affirmative action, the number of black students on their campuses would drop from 7% to 2%.
*  I don't have a law degree, although the longer I do this, I feel like my legal expertise
*  certainly is increasing.
*  And after the court's ruling, McGann and his team at Amherst poured over the decision,
*  which came in the form of a 237-page PDF.
*  You know, we didn't get the chance to ask the Supreme Court, so we do this.
*  So what now?
*  Like, it's not a step-by-step manual, so we're left with the work to figure out how we make
*  sure that we're compliance with everything.
*  But what does being in compliance mean exactly?
*  Unlike with sports, orchestra, and geographic status, race is now off the table.
*  But what if participating in an extracurricular, like the black student union has to do with
*  race?
*  How would that work?
*  And so just to get specific, like, with an extracurricular activity, for instance, for a student,
*  says that they were a member of the BSU.
*  How could that have been considered before the affirmative action ruling and what changes
*  about it after?
*  Okay.
*  So that cannot be put in the context of, well, so understanding a student's participation
*  in an activity through a lens of racial status is something that the very least cannot
*  be as easily done anymore.
*  We're still working on our training and guideline language on how the admission staff should
*  approach these questions.
*  We're still working on that.
*  All right.
*  Well, thank you so much for your time and good luck with the next admission cycle and,
*  again, thank you for the time.
*  It's been an interesting conversation and I appreciate your thoughtful approach to it.
*  So that's wishes.
*  It's the right choice.
*  The Dina Amherst isn't the only one scratching his head over this ruling.
*  In several on and off the record conversations with current and former deans of emissions,
*  they expressed tremendous uncertainty about how all of this is going to work, how you
*  not consider a race, when it could be so apparent in things like a student's extracurriculars,
*  their last name, their essay topic.
*  But as I continued to talk to admissions officers, I finally started to get somewhere.
*  They seemed to all point to a key passage in the decision that was in this moment of darkness
*  and kind of North Star.
*  Chief Justice Roberts wrote it, and it goes, nothing in this opinion should be construed
*  as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant's discussion of how a race affected
*  his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise.
*  But he says, a benefit to a student who overcame racial discrimination, for example, must
*  be tied to that student's courage and determination, or a benefit to a student whose heritage or
*  culture motivated him or her to assume a leadership role or attain a particular goal
*  must be tied to that student's unique ability to contribute to the university.
*  In other words, the student must be treated on the basis of his or her experiences as
*  an individual, not on the basis of race.
*  So what does that mean?
*  Roberts says that if a student does write about race, you as the admissions officer will
*  now have to connect race to a lived experience, like overcoming discrimination.
*  Then you'd have to explain how overcoming discrimination uniquely connects to the mission
*  of the college, like how overcoming discrimination shows resilience and promise, and these are
*  the students that we're looking for.
*  The distinction between race and race as a lived experience is a granular distinction,
*  and I wasn't sure how it would play out.
*  But by the fall, as colleges launched their applications on the Common App, I began
*  to notice a new kind of essay question pop up.
*  Over and over again, I kept seeing schools introduce new supplemental essay prompts that
*  draw words directly from Roberts' passage.
*  Just like talk about lived experiences and how you could uniquely contribute to their
*  campus.
*  It was a subtle change, but a change nonetheless.
*  For example, Brown University used to ask his applicants to write, quote,
*  about a time when you were challenged by a perspective that differed from your own.
*  Here, it allowed applicants to argue that by simply belonging to a minority group,
*  other students can learn from them in vice versa.
*  It relied on a previous Supreme Court precedent that says colleges can use affirmative action
*  to create a diverse learning environment.
*  But after the overturning of that precedent, Brown replaced it with a new prompt this
*  year, with words drawn directly from Roberts.
*  It read, share how an aspect of your growing up has inspired or challenged you.
*  And what unique contributions this might allow you to make to the Brown community.
*  The key change here is that there is now a right kind of race essay and a wrong kind.
*  And in the end, I found that at least 20 selective colleges, including several in the Ivy
*  League, had changed their essay questions this year, using words from Roberts' passage.
*  But the students this year will have a hard time understanding the distinction on their
*  own.
*  The plaintiffs will look at any institution that doesn't see a dip in wonder.
*  Were you like wink, wink using a proxy, but really going against the law?
*  So, you know, I want to be really clear.
*  And I would want you to print that Colorado College is going to follow the law.
*  I know that it's an optimistic goal to try to maintain compositional diversity.
*  And we probably won't to be honest with you.
*  But I don't want to set a goal that we will.
*  We've got to set aspirational goals.
*  But you're right, that our numbers probably will decline.
*  In my conversations with admissions scenes, they told me their schools were still committed
*  to diversity.
*  But the schools aren't a bit of a bind.
*  If they produce the same level of racial diversity in the incoming year, as the year before
*  the ruling, they put themselves at legal risk.
*  The anti-affirmative action opposition are on the lookout for schools that, behind the
*  closed doors of admissions offices, are practicing a kind of under the table affirmative action.
*  I talked to Jeff Brunzel, who was the dean of admissions at Yale, but is now working
*  with Morehouse College to figure out what this new world of admissions is starting to look
*  like.
*  He crunched the numbers.
*  He estimates that there will be a 20 to 30 percent drop in black enrollment in the
*  top 100 colleges.
*  He says he expects HBCUs, like Morehouse, to catch some of those 20 to 30 percent.
*  But it's unclear how many of those students, those colleges can actually support.
*  And that's for Latino students.
*  No one I talked to has speculated on where they might wind up.
*  I asked McGann at Amherst, given all of this, whether students of color applying this year
*  have a harder time getting into schools, schools like Amherst.
*  I would hope that that student would know that nothing about this changes who they are.
*  And it's incumbent upon the colleges.
*  It's not the students job.
*  The student should present themselves as wholly and fully and as best they can.
*  And it's on the colleges to baffily consider and have a admission process that allows
*  them to live up to their mission.
*  Okay, I have it on the recording thing.
*  Okay, great.
*  And you're holding it to your ear like you're on the phone.
*  Just weeks before Francesco submitted his application to MIT.
*  I call him after school.
*  To start, I would just love to know like how you're feeling about the applications you have
*  so far.
*  I really like it.
*  I feel that it speaks to I am.
*  I wanted to know where he landed, whether he ended up mentioning race in his application
*  essay.
*  No, I don't think I did.
*  I did try to stay away from it.
*  He says even though race is still a big part of who he is, it's not the thing he wants
*  in missions officers to see.
*  I don't want to be categorized saying, oh, he's in Hispanic.
*  Then saying like, oh, look at what he's done.
*  He's done this.
*  He's done that.
*  I was actually speaking to one of my friends about it.
*  We were saying it's essentially like, I guess confined to like a box.
*  And I said, oh, what race are you like Hispanic?
*  Right?
*  And I've tried for my race.
*  I'm not saying like, oh, I'm ashamed.
*  But specifically pertaining to college application, I want to show them who I am as a person.
*  What my dreams are, what I like, what are my aspirations, who I am.
*  When you think about someone boxing you in because they know your racial background, what
*  do you think that boxing is or what do you think that boxing in means?
*  Yeah, I want to become fine by saying, oh, they have this preconceived notion of me being
*  Hispanic.
*  Okay.
*  And I don't know their attitudes or their feelings.
*  But whether or not there are people in the world who don't like my race or just they have
*  differing opinions.
*  And that's okay.
*  People have their right to have their own opinions.
*  But I want to go in saying who I am.
*  So if I ever were to become fine in that box, essentially an issue for me.
*  It's a way to play safe.
*  Yeah, just play it safe.
*  You know, in a world where affirmative action was still practiced by colleges and by admissions
*  officers where it would actually be a favor to you, would you have mentioned your racial
*  background?
*  If it were an advantage to me, then I take it.
*  But now that it's gone, I'd rather play it safe.
*  His decision is fueled in part by the same narrative I heard from the other students
*  at the workshop six months ago, which is this feeling of increasing distrust.
*  Francesco knew that affirmative action guaranteed that his race could only help him.
*  But now that that protection is gone, he's worried that the discrimination he sees everywhere
*  else in the world could now enter the admissions process.
*  Because at the end of the day, the world is not a kind place as much as I don't like it.
*  But I got to deal with it, especially heading into the adult world.
*  It's kind of scary and confusing.
*  But I'm also trying to keep an open mind and just figure my way out through this world,
*  this new world I'm entering.
*  A few weeks ago, I met up with Jordan, who if you remember, was working on his essay
*  on the movie Training Day.
*  He ended up scrapping that all together.
*  He said he thought more about the court's ruling, and unlike Francesco, he decided he
*  would not only mention his race, but he was going to dedicate the topic of his essay to
*  his identity, about growing up as a black kid in the Bronx, he said.
*  If the Supreme Court ruling says race doesn't matter, he's saying race matters to me, and
*  this is how.
*  And that's the choice of generation of 17-year-olds, having to make in a moment as formative as applying
*  to college.
*  Do they choose to define themselves by their race like Jordan, or do they hide their
*  race like Francesco?
*  And while that choice may or may not mean the difference between getting in and not,
*  it will almost certainly shape how they see themselves, and how they think the world sees
*  them.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the bombing attack that killed 84 people
*  in Iran on Wednesday, a claim that according to the Times aligns with an intelligence
*  assessment by American officials.
*  The claim is significant because some Iranian leaders had initially sought to blame Israel
*  for the attack, raising fears that Israel's war in Gaza could widen into a regional conflict.
*  Now that ISIS has said it was responsible, then it possibility seems less likely.
*  And new documents released by congressional Democrats show that during Donald Trump's
*  presidency, his businesses received at least $7.8 million from 24 in governments, most
*  of it from China.
*  The transactions offer concrete evidence that Trump engaged in the kind of conduct that
*  congressional Republicans alleged that President Biden did as they tried so far without success
*  to build a case for impeaching him.
*  Today's episode was reported and produced by Jessica Chung with help from Will Reade.
*  It was edited by Lindsay Garrison and Michael Benoit.
*  That checked by Susan Lee contains original music by Mary Luzano, Pat McCusker and Rowan
*  Yamisto, and was engineered by Alyssa Moxley.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Lanzberg, of Wonderly.
*  This is it for the day away.
*  I'm Michael Babar.
*  See you on Monday.
