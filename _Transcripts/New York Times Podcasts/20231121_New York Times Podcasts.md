*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavrini-C, and this is The Daily.
*  Israel's war against Hamas has caused large-scale destruction in Gaza, and a death toll that
*  now stands at nearly 13,000 people, according to Gaza Health officials.
*  Now, as the war enters its seventh week, Israel finds itself under intense pressure from allies
*  and from critics to justify its strategy.
*  Today, my colleague Patrick Kingsley goes inside Gaza with the Israeli military to a hospital
*  that's at the heart of Israel's argument.
*  It's Tuesday, November 21st.
*  So Patrick, late Thursday night, you were one of five journalists who were invited
*  by the Israeli military to go inside Gaza to see, really, for the first time, what things
*  looked like on the ground.
*  So tell me how this trip came about and what your questions were going into it, what you wanted to understand.
*  The context was that Israel had just taken control of parts or most of a hospital that has been
*  at the center of the discourse about Israel's invasion of Gaza, and basically become a proxy
*  for a wider debate about the conduct of Israel's air strikes and its invasion.
*  Right.
*  The hospital, as she for is the largest in Gaza, and Israel has since the start of its invasion
*  maintained that it conceals a secret Hamas military base and that therefore the hospital,
*  even though it is a civilian institution, must be captured in order to defeat Hamas and remove
*  Hamas' military capabilities.
*  The war, as we know, has caused catastrophic loss of civilian life.
*  Around 13,000 people, according to the Garcin Health Ministry, have been killed since the start
*  of the war in Gaza.
*  Many of them are civilians, many of them children, and to Palestinians and to many international
*  observers, that is evidence of Israel's indiscriminate targeting of civilians.
*  But to Israel, there's such a high civilian death toll because of Hamas, because Hamas
*  embeds itself, they say, within civilian infrastructure, in or near schools or hospitals,
*  and therefore Israel, in response to the devastating raid on many of its southern towns and villages
*  on October 7th that killed, and estimated 1200 people, has no choice but to target
*  civilian areas.
*  And the issue for hospital is the embodiment of this debate, because it's the largest hospital
*  in Gaza, and if Israel can prove that it was a military infrastructure, then many Israelis
*  think that it will help justify and help sustain international support for its invasion.
*  But if they can't, then to Palestinians and others, it will prove their point that Israel's
*  conduct of the war is illegal and unjustified.
*  So, in a way, the hospital is about more than just a hospital, right?
*  It's about the logic that Israel is applying in the broader war.
*  Absolutely.
*  So, that was the context in which I woke up last Thursday, and we had a lot of questions,
*  and the Israeli military agreed, later in the afternoon, to take me to see the hospital.
*  It was not a decision we took lightly, not least because they did not want to take pictures
*  of the inside of one of the military vehicles that we were traveling in, and they didn't
*  want us to take pictures of the faces of most of the soldiers we were going with.
*  And we were only going to be able to see the places that they wanted us to see,
*  and we weren't going to be able to talk to any Palestinians.
*  So, there were plenty of restrictions on our visit, but we decided it was worth it,
*  because very few journalists have been able to enter Gaza since the start of the war.
*  Those that are in Gaza have had their movements greatly restricted by airstrikes,
*  the Israeli invasion itself, as well as restrictions placed by Hamas.
*  Dozens of Palestinian journalists have died trying to report on what's going on,
*  and we felt that whatever limited window we could get onto what was going on in Gaza
*  in particular at the hospital would be worth it.
*  Just...
*  Walk from there, walk there.
*  New York Times.
*  New York Times, okay.
*  So, tell me the story of going inside Gaza to see this hospital.
*  We started off inside Israel itself at the village of Berri.
*  We are just getting into Hamas, about to leave the Israeli village of Berri,
*  which was one of the villages that was overrun by Hamas, and it's allies on October 7th.
*  We're driving in this Israeli military jeep, on a bumpy farm road.
*  At a certain point we were then taken to a second military vehicle, this time an open-sided jeep.
*  We're joining a long, long convoy of dozens of military vehicles.
*  We then switched our phones on the flight mode, so that after entering Gaza,
*  our phones couldn't be picked up by any digital surveillance systems.
*  We're just crossing the border between Israel and Gaza.
*  In Gaza we just pass through a gate in the fence that divides the Gaza strip from the state of Israel.
*  And so several hours after we arrived at the Kibbutz-Berry,
*  we were finally rumbling into Gaza through a gap in the same fence that Hamas penetrated on October 7th,
*  this time heading into Gaza rather than out of it,
*  and this time heading into darkness.
*  Just the dim lights of the vehicles in the Israeli Army convoy.
*  And above us, the star of the sky.
*  In every village in town we then passed through, there was almost no light coming from the windows.
*  So the convoy was a sort of silent juggernaut making its way through a silent dark landscape.
*  The first village we went to, we didn't see much damage, but...
*  We're now passing a building that looks totally bombed out.
*  As we kept on going.
*  We had three floors.
*  The walls are almost totally destroyed.
*  We could see buildings that felt like someone had taken a bite out of them.
*  The roof appears to have fallen onto the ground floor and the walls are given away.
*  Village after village seemed in total ruin.
*  It's just ruined after ruined destroyed house after destroyed house.
*  Rubble, the coal rubble.
*  It was a kind of ghostly scene, not like the Gaza that I've come to know over the last decade of visits.
*  There was no Palestinian to be seen.
*  More than a million, we understand, a fled south,
*  leaving most villages and most towns mostly empty.
*  You know what kind of building this is to meet?
*  I don't know.
*  I'll tell, I guess.
*  Gaza is a place of noise, it's a place of light, it's a place of life outside of walls.
*  But on this night, shortly after midnight on Friday morning, it felt like a place of death.
*  The last time I was here in the late summer, there were beach resorts, cafes, people swimming in the sea, people drinking juice, drinking coffee.
*  You don't know it's cafes.
*  Watching the sunset.
*  Now I'm surrounded by ruins.
*  So what happened next?
*  We got out of our jeep and...
*  I'm now walking into the Meeha.
*  She's an armoured vehicle, a bit like a tank, but without a gun turret.
*  We entered a heavily armoured personnel carrier.
*  A small ramp.
*  And that showed that while Israel seems to have got the middle section of Gaza roughly under its control,
*  it's still fighting active battles in Gaza City, and they wanted to put us in this personnel carrier in order to guard against ambush.
*  And several minutes later, the city was in a hurry, and the city was in a hurry.
*  We were in this personnel carrier in order to guard against ambush.
*  And several minutes later, we arrived on the edge of Al-Shiva Hospital.
*  And this was a destination, the final destination of our grief journey into northern Gaza.
*  We're now leaving the armoured vehicle, stepping out into the jet flag night.
*  So the doorway to the armoured personnel carrier slowly went down a bit like a drawbridge to a medieval castle.
*  I'm glad by special forces.
*  Creating a gangway from the inside of the vehicle to the ground.
*  We're told by malicious spokesman that we've now entered the hospital.
*  To be honest, I didn't notice.
*  We picked our way from the street through the rubble of a ruin building.
*  And we were ushered into a ruin on the edge of the hospital grounds.
*  The hospital is not just a single building, it's a sort of roughly square shaped complex.
*  And we arrived in what we were told was previously a cafeteria.
*  And there we met Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hex.
*  Who's the international spokesman for the Israeli Army?
*  The watchers there.
*  They were not safe here, you might hear some firing.
*  And we picked our way through the debris and out closer to the centre of the hospital complex towards a shaft.
*  This is one of the entruses shafts.
*  Large wide shaft.
*  This is a Hamas tunnel.
*  They said that they had discovered earlier that day underneath a car that they said had contained weapons and explosives and had belonged to Hamas militants.
*  I just wanted you to get the visual.
*  It's just important that you see this.
*  And the shaft was several yards deep.
*  It had the remains of a metal staircase descending into it.
*  We could see electrical cables descending into the shaft.
*  We couldn't see where the shaft was leading to.
*  But the military said this is the start of the Hamas underground complex that is underneath the hospital.
*  What is it telling us that there's a spiral staircase going down into the ground?
*  It's interesting, but it doesn't prove anything.
*  It doesn't prove that there is a command centre.
*  What would you say it is?
*  I would say it's a spiral staircase leading into the ground.
*  Where to?
*  I don't know, I don't know.
*  It's the middle of the earth.
*  For them, this was proof positive that something untoward was going on within the grounds of Shifa.
*  It was proof positive that there was a military command centre.
*  And it became a subject of dispute because we journalists can't just take people's word for it.
*  We have to see for our own eyes what the shaft is leading to.
*  It could be anywhere. It could be a path to lead us.
*  We have to see that it leads to a tunnel that leads to a command centre that has weapons in it and so on.
*  And what we were seeing was simply not that.
*  It was something that seemed odd.
*  Why would there be a shaft with a staircase leading down into the ground on the grounds of a hospital?
*  But without further information, without further images, without being able to go down to the bottom of the shaft and proceed further,
*  we could not conclude more than that.
*  So is the idea that you can't go further down the spiral staircase because there might be explosives?
*  Because it could be BB-TRA and BB-TRA and BB-TRA. It just takes time.
*  We'll do it. We'll get them.
*  And the military, the senior officers told us, that was impossible for now.
*  It keeps us a long time to find this and we've been pressed for the last 36 hours.
*  Why we didn't come with a big victory picture and show the command centre. This is going to take time.
*  And they are very frustrated with the outside world, that the outside world cannot see this for what they believe it to be.
*  But for now, we felt that this was only a shaft.
*  A shaft that is maybe suspicious but inconclusive.
*  I think that's the right summary.
*  The shaft is odd. It's intriguing.
*  We can imagine what it might lead to but it stops short so far of being inconclusive evidence of anything.
*  But so we can't go into the hospital.
*  And so we pushed them for other evidence. We pushed them to take us into other places in the hospital complex.
*  They said they couldn't do that for now for a bunch of reasons including that they fear that Hamas fighters were still in parts of the hospital.
*  They were looking for the help of the hospital that they did not fully control and that some government from within parts of the hospital fight on them when they first entered our hospital compound.
*  And for them this again was more proof of what they've been saying along that Hamas fights from within the hospital.
*  It's not Israel that's to blame for attacking a hospital or a place that's supposed to be off limits during a war but it's Hamas and it's allies who have broken international law by entering it in the first place.
*  This is additional equipment that we find.
*  We also asked if we could see some of the weapons and IEDs and so on that they said that they collected.
*  They showed us to a shelf where some of them were naturally anyone can put a bunch of weapons on a shelf.
*  And so this in itself is not proof even if they were really were taken from other locations in the hospital.
*  It's not something that we as an international newspaper can accept as proof.
*  Right.
*  It's all due to nothing but we're good enough for you.
*  You left.
*  You're a 10L, you see a 10L, it's underground.
*  What else do you need?
*  This caused a back and forth because they were desperately hoping that this would be enough to convince international reporters but inevitably it wasn't.
*  Can we meet Dr Abbas Almeer?
*  You can.
*  And while you were at Shifa, did you see patients?
*  Did you see doctors or even the civilians who were taking shelter there?
*  We saw none.
*  Because I can't go near the hospital.
*  We asked to visit them and we were told it was too dangerous to enter that section of the hospital.
*  We gave some fuel and you can see lights are still on.
*  So they're taking the fuel?
*  I don't know.
*  But the soldiers pointed to how there were some lights on in the hospital and the situation there remained tenable.
*  But we knew from other reporting that there was a desperate situation inside.
*  Hundreds of thousands of displaced people who fled to the hospital for their safety.
*  Hundreds of wounded and injured people, some of them on live support machines and more than 30 premature babies who were at risk of dying.
*  But you didn't see any of that.
*  No.
*  Okay, so at the end of your time at the hospital, it seems like what you've learned is that the Israeli military thinks they have some evidence of a command center.
*  But it's this shaft, which is kind of unclear what it is or where it goes.
*  There is certain that Hamas has been shooting at them from within the Shifa complex.
*  That suggests that they are to some extent operating in the civilian place.
*  Though you don't see evidence of that either.
*  Like basically some evidence of some things, but nothing all that conclusive about any part of it.
*  Exactly, not yet.
*  And when we got back into the armored personnel carrier.
*  Can you ask the request for my permission?
*  And rumbled back through the sudden neighborhoods of Gaza City.
*  All these questions that had been in my mind at the start of the journey remained there.
*  The question of whether there was conclusive proof that Hamas had been using this hospital as a military command center.
*  And as we stood amid such a disfigured and damaged landscape.
*  Why and whether such disfigurements, such damage was necessary and justified.
*  And that question led to a wider discussion with the commanding officer of the brigade that has captured that part of Gaza.
*  So I've come to Gaza many times.
*  And this would be the area where I would go for my morning run every day.
*  I'd go up the beach, see the cafes, see the swimming.
*  Now I can't even recognize it.
*  And when I asked the commanding officer of the brigade, Colonel Alad Suri, this...
*  Can you explain, in justifiably, the scale of the destruction.
*  These cafes are gone.
*  The beachfront resorts have gone.
*  The lifeguard and towers have gone.
*  The apartment blocks are all shut out.
*  Why was that so necessary?
*  Was every apartment full of terrorists?
*  Was it every building?
*  Every junction here was full with enemy that fired on us.
*  So I'm sure it's a beautiful place.
*  I'm sure it could be a beautiful place.
*  But they are firing on us.
*  So we have no other option.
*  We are in a war.
*  This is a war zone.
*  And it's full with enemy ammunition, IDs, RPGs everywhere.
*  Mortars that they are firing from this neighborhood to Israel.
*  Mortars, I know, it's a beautiful place.
*  It could be.
*  But they are firing from here to Tel Aviv.
*  Did you also see this when you were here?
*  He responded in a way that suggested my question came from a place of luxury, of privilege and of moral luck.
*  His point was fundamentally that the Israeli soldiers that he commanded had had no choice but to fire back at the places where the Hamas fight his war.
*  And by extension, destroy or damage the buildings in which Hamas was hiding.
*  I think we can all understand the need to take out rocket launches and places where Hamas members firing on Israel.
*  But is every part of this area, and it's basically all gone?
*  Did it all of it have to be taken out?
*  Every place that fire on Israeli soldiers need to be taken out.
*  Yes, we are in a war, sir.
*  It is what it is.
*  How much?
*  And they could live here.
*  The people, Gaza's people, not Hamas, Gaza's civilians, beautiful life.
*  But it was not what they choose.
*  And this was a microcosm of his wider point, which was that.
*  While to me this looked like a deskcape, a hellscape, ruined upon ruin,
*  that that fundamentally was something that Hamas had brought on itself.
*  This is fundamentally the Israeli case.
*  Yes. And it's a refrain that you hear in Israel over and over.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Patrick, we were just talking about your visit inside Shifa Hospital.
*  And in that visit, you saw suggestive but not conclusive evidence of Israel's claim that there's a Hamas.
*  And that there's a Hamas command center under it.
*  What has happened since your visit?
*  Since my visit, they've released more evidence.
*  They have shown two more videos of the shaft that we visited.
*  But this time, they've shown us what the shaft leads to.
*  And the shaft seems to lead to a tunnel.
*  A tunnel that extends perhaps dozens of meters underneath the ground
*  until it reaches a metal door.
*  And that's when the videos that they have released stop.
*  And has the times independently confirmed that this is, in fact, from Shifa, this video?
*  Yes. We've confirmed both our video investigation team has confirmed that this video is from Shifa.
*  And we can see from the images ourselves, me and my colleagues who were down there on Friday morning,
*  that this was the same shaft that we looked at.
*  That's not the only bit of evidence that Israeli army has produced since we've been sent.
*  They've also released a close circuit television footage that shows people dragging in someone under duress into the entrance of one of the buildings of the Shifa hospital.
*  And it also shows them wheeling someone who looks badly injured through on a gurney, through the corridors of Shifa hospital.
*  Israeli army says that these people were people that were kidnapped on October 7th,
*  and that this is more evidence that Hamas used the Shifa hospital as some kind of military command center.
*  And the times has also verified the location.
*  What we haven't done is confirm the exact timings of those videos.
*  And the videos themselves do have the date of October 7th in the top left hand corner.
*  So bringing the hostages into the hospital could actually mean that Hamas is using it as some kind of base of some sort.
*  Exactly. There's a counter-argument that says that just because they brought injured people into the hospital,
*  that doesn't mean that the hospital is being used as some kind of military nerve center.
*  And that's why people perhaps were injured and needed to be treated.
*  The counter-argument to that is that at least one of those people does not seem to be badly injured.
*  And secondly, there is more than one hospital in Gaza.
*  In fact, there's schools of hospitals.
*  And if Hamas or their allies were really concerned about rushing people to have medical treatment,
*  they could have gone to any number of other medical centers in hospitals that are closer to Israel than Shifa.
*  Patrick, to the question that we started this conversation with,
*  the question of whether there is proof of these really claimed that there is a command center under the hospital,
*  there is more evidence, but it does still seem to stop short of conclusive proof, right?
*  That's right. Lots of intriguing evidence is coming out.
*  But from a journalistic point of view, if this was a New York Times investigation,
*  our editors would say to us, go back and gather more evidence.
*  And not the conclusive slam dunk that you're saying that it is.
*  And indeed, that is what our editors are saying right now.
*  We're still saying that this stopped short so far of conclusive proof of military command center underneath the hospital.
*  But is it tunnel with a big metal door that goes down deep into the earth,
*  not pretty damning of Hamas, though?
*  I mean, why would there be a tunnel under a hospital at all?
*  That's a very good question.
*  And one that we're all asking, and they don't seem to be that many innocent explanations for why that would be.
*  All that said, this still is full short of conclusive proof,
*  and we need to wait days, possibly weeks, for further evidence to be presented.
*  So in a world where this is the extent of the evidence of the claim that Hamas is underground there at the hospital,
*  what does it mean about the broader underlying justification for hitting a lot of the civilian places that they have been hit?
*  If this is it, if this is all we're ever going to see in terms of evidence, what does it mean?
*  I think it means that in the outside world, the battle line that have already been drawn between Israel and its supporters and the Palestinians and their supporters will not really shift.
*  And it's going to remain a subject of debate.
*  And more broadly, it means that the debate over whether Israel has been indiscriminately targeting civilian infrastructure or whether Hamas has been betting itself within civilian institutions is not really going to be shifted because both sides are going to dig in and say that they have enough evidence to prove their point.
*  Okay, so let's consider the reverse. In a world where we do eventually see conclusive proof of a command center underneath shift of hospital, what will it mean specifically about how Israel thinks about the total death toll?
*  Israel will say that it buttresses their argument that they are not totally to blame for such a high civilian death toll.
*  They will say that look, Hamas was embedded within Gaza's largest hospital.
*  Is it any surprise that when we had to take action following Hamas's raid on Israel on October 7th, our response had a civilian toll.
*  Do you think it still begs the question about Israel's calculus when it comes to civilian deaths? And of course, the reason I ask you this is that Israel's stated goal and really the goal in any military conflict is supposed to be to target militants, right?
*  Enemies, not civilians. But if the ratio is far, far more civilians are dying versus Hamas militants, that's pretty meaningful.
*  I think this question boils down to how many civilian deaths is too many civilian deaths. And there are many people who look at what's going on in Gaza and say that even one civilian death is too many.
*  But to others, including many in Israel, the question really is about whether Israel is taking precautions to minimize the loss of civilian life when attempting the very difficult task of targeting the civilian deaths.
*  And that's the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question
*  of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question to President Clinton said that whip ball they dealt with
*  sinks to military death,
*  for leaders, that Gleiche says that the educate students in measure school will have drill jobs with an BACK treatmentров
*  ellos person to be black allows them on both sides will take a standing
*  literally anywhere and everywhere.
*  And so that everything is a potential target.
*  But because the stated goal of Israel is to eliminate Hamas, it seems like the only logical
*  outcome of that is basically the total destruction of Gaza.
*  And of course, even more civilians dying in the process.
*  Yes.
*  And that's why when I went in on early on Friday morning, we saw such devastation, village
*  up to village of collapse buildings, rubble, roads completely churned up, apartment blocks,
*  largely destroyed.
*  It looked like a hellscape and largely unlivable.
*  So Patrick, are you getting any indication that any of this, you know, the large numbers
*  of deaths, the destruction that you yourself witnessed in Gaza is making these realies
*  at all, queasy or uncomfortable with their overall strategy of targeting Hamas within civilian
*  areas.
*  I mean, is there any indication that they're considering whether there might be a different
*  way to do all of this?
*  Some other way where the toll on civilians is less severe.
*  Are there other tactics being contemplated?
*  I think they're not just being contemplated, but we are seeing those actions to some extent
*  being carried out on the ground, not in a way that feels meaningful to many of Israel's
*  critics, but nevertheless, they are taking place.
*  An example of that is the operation to capture sheep for hospital.
*  Following a lot of American pressure, Israel decided to send in only a small force to capture
*  certain parts of it and to search certain parts of it, rather than sending in overwhelming
*  force that might have created a blood bath.
*  And while this is small consolation to many Palestinians and indeed the people who were inside
*  the hospital who have not had anything like proper treatment in the last few weeks, this
*  was in Israel's eyes.
*  And indeed, I think in the eyes of some of its allies, as an example of Israel trying
*  to temper what it was doing.
*  Interesting.
*  What about the question of hostages?
*  Is all of this strategy to destroy Hamas and its military capability jeopardize that
*  other major goal?
*  Getting those 240-some odd hostages back?
*  How does that factor into the strategy at this point?
*  On the one hand, the further the Israel pushes inside Gaza, the greater the chance of street
*  fighting and even subterranean fighting between Israeli soldiers and Hamas fighters becomes.
*  And as that likelihood rises so true, the hostages might be killed in the crossfire.
*  And that's why there are protests, not huge numbers of protesters, but there are protesters
*  inside Israel who want a ceasefire in order to save the lives of hostages.
*  The flip side though, the further Israel goes inside Gaza, the more intelligence it's
*  able to pick up about the location of the hostages.
*  The light clearer is that it might be able to rescue some of those hostages.
*  And thirdly, the light clearer is that Hamas might feel more pressured to release some
*  hostages in order to secure a ceasefire that would buy Hamas some time to regroup, to rebuild
*  its remaining infrastructure, to get fuel in, to get food in both for civilian population,
*  but also probably for its own purposes.
*  And what we have now, negotiations conducted through mediators between Israel and Hamas
*  about the release of some of those hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners inside
*  Israeli jails.
*  Those negotiations we understand are closer to reaching some kind of conclusion, but it
*  could be days if not another week before those negotiations actually do bear fruit.
*  What's your best guess about where the Israeli strategy goes?
*  What's going to happen?
*  I think it's likely we're going to have a ceasefire at some point in the next week that would
*  allow for some hostages to be exchanged for some Palestinian prisoners inside Israeli
*  jails.
*  But even if that doesn't happen, again, it seems likely that Israel is going to head south.
*  That's where Israel believes that the Hamas leadership, including Yakis, Sinwa, the head
*  of Hamas in Gaza is hiding.
*  There's also some talk that that's actually where most of the hostages are.
*  And that is going to compound a devastating humanitarian crisis in the south.
*  Right, because most of the people from the north had fled to the south, right?
*  So the south is now housing the majority of the Gaza population.
*  Exactly.
*  The population of southern Gaza has probably doubled.
*  We've got around two million people in this relatively small pocket of land.
*  There are reports of diseases spreading.
*  People are scavenging for food and mortar every day because of such a shortage.
*  It's a really desperate situation as it is.
*  And with an invading army heading into that mess, it is expected to get a whole lot worse.
*  What we could see to mitigate that, albeit only in relative terms, is for another transfer
*  of the population back up to the north.
*  Where too is really unclear because, as I saw large parts of northern Gaza, I decimated
*  and it's not entirely clear where people would go if they went back north to where they
*  have been living.
*  The question is, come back to what?
*  In many cases, they will be coming back to ruins.
*  Patrick, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Monday, a Federal appeals court drastically weakened the Voting Rights Act, issuing
*  a ruling that would effectively bar private citizens and civil rights groups from filing
*  lawsuits under a central provision of the law.
*  The ruling, made by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, found that only the
*  Federal Government could bring a legal challenge under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, a
*  crucial part of the law that prohibits election or voting practices that discriminate against
*  Americans based on race.
*  The opinion is almost certain to be appealed to the Supreme Court, where the current conservative
*  majority has a mixed record when it comes to cases on voting rights.
*  Today's episode was produced by Astha Chetervady, Stella Tan and Carlos Prieto, with help from
*  Summer to Mod.
*  It was edited by Paige Cowatt and Patricia Willens, contains original music by Mary and
*  Luzano, Dan Powell, and Rowan Nemisto, and was engineered by Chris Wood.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Lansford of Wonder Lane.
*  That's it for the Daily.
*  I'm Sabrina Tavernese.
*  See you tomorrow.
