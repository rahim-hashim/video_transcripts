# Abortion United Evangelicals and Republicans. Now That Alliance Is Fraying.
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAiOKaTdPJA)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  The Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the country, voted
*  at its annual gathering last week to condemn IVF fertility treatments.
*  Today, my colleague Ruth Graham, on the story behind the vote, the Republican scramble it
*  prompted, and what it could eventually mean for the rest of the country.
*  It's Monday, June 17th.
*  So Ruth, you write about religion for the Times, and you were covering the big annual
*  meeting of Southern Baptists last week.
*  And they made a pretty big decision.
*  Tell us about it.
*  The Southern Baptist Convention, it's the biggest Protestant denomination in the United
*  States.
*  They have almost 13 million members, more than 45,000 churches.
*  It's a huge group.
*  And they also consider these resolutions on what they see as important cultural and political
*  topics.
*  And those discussions are really important because, you know, Southern Baptists know
*  their political power, and they are basically a barometer of evangelical sentiment in the
*  U.S.
*  You know, what they say kind of indicates what the typical evangelical cares about in
*  any given moment.
*  And fun for reporters, they all meet once a year in this giant gathering that any church
*  can send delegates to.
*  The delegates are called messengers.
*  So this year, that meeting was in Indianapolis.
*  There were almost 11,000 messengers there in the convention center.
*  And one of the important political topics they took on this year was something they
*  have never discussed as a full body before, and that's the ethics of in vitro fertilization.
*  Okay, so this very important conference of Southern Baptist takes up IVF.
*  In other words, you know, the medical procedure that allows people to get pregnant through
*  fertilization in a lab.
*  So what do they say?
*  So a lot of Southern Baptists historically have not taken issue with IVF per se at all.
*  They view it as a technology used to create life.
*  It's used by families who desperately want to be parents, and they view that as a positive
*  thing.
*  But the procedure does involve typically the production of more embryos than will be used
*  by the couple that created them.
*  And those embryos end up sometimes discarded, sometimes frozen indefinitely, sometimes donated,
*  but not sort of used in the way that they were originally created to be used.
*  So some Southern Baptists do take issue with discarding those excess embryos.
*  And the reason is they say life begins at conception, this is sort of a core anti-abortion
*  belief.
*  The moment that the sperm meets the egg, that is the stuff of life.
*  There's a verse in Psalms, you created my inmost being, you knit me together in my mother's
*  womb.
*  And you'll hear that cited in Christian anti-abortion spaces a lot as evidence that God cares about
*  and views as fully human, human beings at the very moment of conception.
*  And that would include these frozen embryos.
*  Right.
*  If you truly believe that life begins at conception, you probably would not agree to abortion at
*  any stage of gestation.
*  And that same logic would apply to IVF.
*  So when this issue gets raised at the conference, what happens?
*  What are people saying?
*  So there's a resolution that comes to the floor.
*  Resolutions in Southern Baptist language are non-binding.
*  This would not be a ban.
*  It's just a statement of concern that's meant to summarize Southern Baptist opinion on this
*  particular topic.
*  So the language that's proposed calls on Southern Baptist to reaffirm the value of human life.
*  And then it narrows in on human life in an embryonic stage.
*  And it urges them to just use reproductive technologies, fertility treatments that are
*  consistent with that view of human life.
*  What does that mean?
*  They're actually walking a pretty fine line here.
*  They stop short of saying that a Southern Baptist should never use IVF under any circumstances.
*  They're calling attention to these excess embryos and saying that, you know, Baptists
*  really should only use reproductive technology with attention to life at this embryonic stage.
*  And the resolution also goes so far as to ask Baptists to call on their governments
*  to restrain these kind of technologies that violate the dignity of, you know, as they
*  put it, quote, frozen embryonic human beings.
*  So they're also actually asking people to pressure their governments to respect this
*  position, basically.
*  That's right. It's light on specifics, but that's the suggestion.
*  But Ruth, why did they decide to raise this issue now?
*  I mean, IVF obviously has been around for a long time.
*  Right. So back in February, there was a case that reached the Alabama Supreme Court that
*  had started when a group of families in the state filed this wrongful death claim over
*  a mistake at a fertility clinic where their frozen embryos were accidentally destroyed.
*  They sue and the state Supreme Court ends up ruling not only in their favor, but says
*  really clearly that frozen embryos should be considered children.
*  So the chief justice writes, even before birth, all human beings have the image of God and
*  their lives cannot be destroyed without effacing his glory.
*  So really putting out this religious argument for human life in embryonic form.
*  So that case lands like a bomb.
*  The stunning decision from Alabama's Supreme Court has enormous and immediate consequences
*  for fertility care.
*  And it really caught a lot of people off guard, you know, all along the spectrum.
*  A third fertility clinic in Alabama has shut down after the state Supreme Court ruled embryos
*  are children.
*  The court offered no clear roadmap for what is and isn't legal.
*  And it just places this question about the ethics and the legal aspects and all of this.
*  It just puts IVF into the national conversation.
*  We're concerned that with the new ruling, we may have to limit fertilization of eggs,
*  which will limit success of treatment, limit efficiency, increase cost and, of course,
*  risk to patients.
*  It's a stressful process already, and I don't need the added stress of and no woman does
*  of whether or not this might be moral to go through to have children when this is my only
*  path.
*  And there's this really strong backlash to the idea that embryos should be protected
*  with the force of the law as full human beings, because IVF is broadly popular, including
*  among many Republican voters.
*  Alabama House of Representatives and the Senate have passed a law that restores access to
*  in vitro fertilization.
*  Doctors at clinics have told ABC News the new language will give them enough reassurance
*  to resume IVF without facing legal risks.
*  Ultimately, the state legislature, the Republican governor, you know, work really quickly to
*  reinstate it in the state.
*  But it opens up this new conversation among conservative evangelicals who are broadly
*  anti-abortion.
*  And they're starting to think, you know, should we think about this IVF conversation in the
*  same way that we've thought about abortion?
*  Should we be pushing on this more?
*  So most of the country takes the lesson from the Alabama case that IVF is not something
*  to be interfered with.
*  But for some in the evangelical community, they take the opposite lesson, it sounds like.
*  That's right.
*  For some evangelicals, this feels like the perfect moment to bring IVF into the abortion
*  conversation and start to turn the tide against it.
*  One of these people is an ethicist in Kentucky.
*  His name is Andrew Walker.
*  He works at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.
*  It's a major Southern Baptist seminary in Louisville.
*  And he's been wanting to bring IVF into sort of the mainstream Southern Baptist consciousness
*  for a while.
*  He first started writing about it about five years ago.
*  He actually published an essay in a sort of mainstream evangelical publication about it,
*  got a lot of pushback, never felt it was the right moment to bring a resolution to the
*  meeting.
*  But he's had this tucked in the back of his mind because he has this pretty clear conviction
*  that IVF does not comport with Christian anti-abortion values.
*  So when the Alabama ruling happens and the backlash and the broader conversation, Andrew
*  Walker thinks, you know, this is the moment.
*  So he calls his friend and mentor, Dr. Al Mohler, who's the president of the seminary
*  where they both work.
*  And he says, let's do it.
*  Let's start crafting a resolution for the meeting this year.
*  And we'll see if it gets forward.
*  We'll see if it gets discussed.
*  We'll see if it gets approved.
*  But we've got to strike while the iron is hot here.
*  And did Baptists like Walker understand that a resolution like this would have potentially
*  quite bad implications for mainstream Republican politicians?
*  Like wasn't that the lesson of Alabama?
*  Yes.
*  And I talked with both Dr. Walker and Dr. Mohler about this.
*  And they both said they were completely aware of that.
*  They didn't love it.
*  But they both felt that that was not their highest priority.
*  That was not their highest responsibility.
*  And if anything, you know, Dr. Mohler said this in particular, he wanted to nudge Republicans
*  on the issue.
*  He actually said he wanted to do more than nudge Republicans.
*  He wanted to call them out.
*  And so this would be a really high profile way to show to Republicans, look, we've got
*  of mainstream Southern Baptists in a room here who are all expressing collective alarm
*  and opposition to IVF as it's commonly practiced.
*  Okay, so Baptist leaders nevertheless put this proposal to a vote on the floor.
*  Tell us about how that went when they put this proposal in front of thousands of other
*  evangelicals.
*  It was really dramatic.
*  We're in this cavernous convention hall where over the course of the last few days, there's
*  been singing of hymns, people have heard sermons, there's been prayers, they've sent missionaries
*  out.
*  You know, they've been sort of together in the work of making their convention what they
*  want it to be.
*  Microphone 3A, would you give us your name, your church, and proceed with your discussion?
*  Yes, Daniel Taylor, Messenger for all the charity Baptists.
*  And then there's this incredibly dramatic discussion and debate about the ethics of
*  something so personal.
*  Thank you, Mr. President.
*  I rise to speak in favor of this amendment out of both a heart for the unborn and for
*  those stricken with infertility.
*  Anyone is allowed to come to the microphone under Southern Baptist rules.
*  And you had two men come to the microphone to share really personal stories.
*  For my friends, the initial steps of IVF yielded six viable embryos.
*  Four of the embryos were implanted and two were frozen for a time.
*  Only one survived to term, their son and my godson.
*  Because of him, I thank God for IVF.
*  One has a godson born via IVF.
*  I have a son because of IVF.
*  I have another son 20 weeks old in my wife's womb because of IVF.
*  The other has one child and his wife pregnant with a second via IVF.
*  I am for the sanctity of life and for the sanctity of embryos.
*  I am against the idea that this technology is so wicked that it cannot be employed.
*  And both spoke about just loving these children and seeing the technology as a blessing from
*  God.
*  I thank the authors of the resolution and the committee for the opportunity for the
*  to be a voice of biblical truth and clarity in this pressing cultural issue.
*  A woman came to the microphone sort of on the other side.
*  In addition to my living children, I am the mother of four babies that I never got to
*  hold.
*  Two of those babies we adopted as embryos.
*  Nothing in the process of IVF upholds the sanctity of life.
*  There is no way to describe the treatment of embryos at any point in the IVF process
*  as ethical or dignified.
*  To share that she had participated in embryo adoption, meaning that she had another family's
*  embryos implanted in her womb to try to bring those pregnancies to fruition.
*  And in this case, she miscarried both times, but she had done that out of a sense of really
*  moral obligation to these embryos as human life.
*  And it was quiet.
*  I mean, people are really listening to these really personal stories and wrestling with
*  them.
*  This is personal for a lot of people in that room.
*  But at the end of all this, it's time to vote on the resolution.
*  So in the end, the language has been really carefully crafted to kind of bring Southern
*  Baptists along on this argument.
*  So it affirms that God loves all children no matter the circumstances of their conception.
*  It expresses empathy for couples trying to conceive.
*  It says it's a good and positive thing to want to have children, to expand your family.
*  And then it arrives at this point of saying that IVF, as it's commonly practiced, is not
*  an ethical option for Southern Baptists in most circumstances.
*  So this resolution comes to a vote to the thousands of people in that room.
*  They're all sitting in folding chairs.
*  They raise their little orange ballots in favor or against.
*  And the resolution passes overwhelmingly.
*  So this resolution ultimately passes.
*  But how important is it really if it's just an expression of sentiment?
*  It's not actually a directive to do something.
*  It's hugely significant.
*  This is the first major public statement that this group of influential evangelicals, frankly
*  influential Republican voters have made on this issue.
*  And it really sets them up on a collision course with mainstream Republicans.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Ruth, you said that this vote really sets evangelicals on a collision course with mainstream
*  Republicans.
*  What did that look like?
*  So mainstream Republicans in the wake of the Alabama ruling have really circled the wagons
*  to try to show that they are not only totally comfortable with IVF, but are going to go
*  to great lengths to preserve it.
*  And they see it as pro-family.
*  They know that's how most of their constituents view it.
*  They want to really show that they see that as totally separate from the conversation
*  about abortion and that they are going to be the ones to preserve access to IVF.
*  So on the very same day this happened in Indianapolis, in Washington...
*  I want to yield to the Senator from Alabama, Senator Britt.
*  Thank you so much.
*  Senator Katie Britt of Alabama, she's an evangelical Christian.
*  She gets up on the floor of the Senate and gives this impassioned speech supporting IVF.
*  I was proud to join my colleague from Texas in introducing the IVF Protection Act.
*  She, with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, has put forward this bill that they say is intended
*  to protect IVF access by blocking Medicaid funding to states that ban it outright.
*  Democrats say that actually would not have done anything to fix the problem and there
*  are these kind of jockeying bills.
*  But still she gets up on the Senate floor.
*  As a mom, I know firsthand that there's no greater joy in this life than that of being
*  a mother.
*  IVF helps aspiring parents...
*  And speaks as a mom, as she puts it, in defense of IVF.
*  IVF access is fundamentally pro-family.
*  She's wearing this really prominent cross necklace and she talks about how supporting
*  IVF is pro-family, that that's the pro-family point of view.
*  We all have loved ones, whether they're family members or friends who have become parents
*  or grandparents through IVF.
*  And she puts out a statement the same day with Senator Cruz and it's signed by all of
*  her Republican colleagues, including Josh Hawley, Marcia Blackburn, you know, every
*  conservative across the spectrum in the Senate signs onto this support for IVF.
*  So even the most conservative Republicans in Congress are coming out with this position
*  that's really at odds with evangelicals.
*  That's right.
*  IVF is hugely popular, fertility treatments are widely used, you know, including by evangelicals.
*  Most people don't even think negatively about this stuff, let alone want to ban it.
*  So it's a real dilemma for Republicans to watch evangelicals potentially turn in this
*  direction.
*  So there's pressure from the Southern Baptist Convention on mainstream Republicans, which
*  I have to imagine is making Democrats pretty happy.
*  I mean, I saw President Biden out there with a fundraising email the day that the Southern
*  Baptists voted.
*  That's right.
*  I mean, Democrats are really leaning into reproductive rights right now.
*  They're putting abortion measures on ballots in November.
*  They know that's going to attract their voters.
*  It's going to attract independents.
*  They're pointing out these restrictions.
*  They're talking about this stuff.
*  And the vote last week from the Southern Baptist is another suggestion that there's this movement
*  out there that doesn't just want to regulate at 15 weeks, not just at 12 weeks, not just
*  at six weeks, but, you know, all the way down to the embryo in the lab.
*  So I think Democrats see an opportunity here to exploit this growing divide between evangelicals
*  and Republicans, at least on this issue.
*  And this is all going to be all the more salient ahead of a very important presidential election.
*  I mean, we're really hurtling down the tracks toward a big decision point for people.
*  Yeah, that's exactly right.
*  The Republican Party and American evangelicals have been in lockstep really since the 1970s.
*  And you know, now for Republicans, there's this question about whether or not it's still
*  politically advantageous for them to follow where the anti-abortion movement is going
*  on this stuff because they're pushing into places that are really deeply unpopular among
*  the American population overall.
*  You know, the anti-abortion movement itself at this point is pretty divided on where it's
*  going to go next.
*  So, you know, we saw the Supreme Court last week on Thursday, you know, they maintained
*  access to the abortion pill.
*  You know, there were divisions even within the anti-abortion movement over whether or
*  not to bring that case forward.
*  Some within that movement were skeptical of it.
*  So you're seeing sort of confusion and disagreement even internally on where to go after the overturning
*  of Roe v. Wade.
*  Ruth, what about the broader population of evangelical Christians?
*  You know, there were 10,000 people at the Southern Baptist Conference voting on this.
*  But what about everybody else?
*  Where are they on this?
*  I think that's still a really open question at this point.
*  You know, I talked to this young pastor from Georgia at the meeting who was saying, you
*  know, I don't want to go back to the people in my church and tell them that the creation
*  of their children and grandchildren comes from these immoral means and the language
*  of the resolution was careful around that, but it's still going to be really hard to
*  get that across and to just translate it for the people in the pews.
*  And if you're an ordinary Southern Baptist, kind of reading the headlines and even reading
*  the text of this, it's a tough one.
*  At the same time, you know, talking with Andrew Walker about this, who co-wrote the resolution,
*  you know, he acknowledged that a lot of Southern Baptists have not really thought about this
*  stuff in terms of ethics and morality and connected it to the abortion question.
*  But when he has one-on-one conversations with people about the topic and sort of walks them
*  through basically the logic of the resolution, you know, he said almost everyone comes away
*  from those conversations with at the very least a sort of skepticism and, you know,
*  a level of critical thinking around fertility treatments that they didn't come in with.
*  And that suggests that there's at least sort of an openness to thinking differently about
*  fertility treatments.
*  And, you know, the reason all this matters is obviously evangelicals are this hugely influential
*  voting bloc.
*  They're used to having the power to turn their theological beliefs into policy.
*  And when they come together, you get this political force, you know, the same political
*  force that worked for decades over a lot of obstacles and was eventually successful in
*  overturning Roe v. Wade.
*  Now, IVF is different than abortion.
*  IVF is extremely popular, including at this point among evangelical Christians.
*  But if we find out that evangelicals are persuadable on IVF, you know, it doesn't just have implications
*  for their personal spiritual lives.
*  If this is the beginning of a moral awakening on IVF, and that's a big if, that would have
*  real implications for the rest of the country.
*  Ruth, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Friday, the Supreme Court struck down a ban on bump stocks, which enable semi-automatic
*  rifles to fire at speeds rivaling those of machine guns.
*  The decision, by a vote of six to three, split along ideological lines, had the effect of
*  erasing one of the government's rare firearm regulations that came from a mass shooting.
*  Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority, said that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
*  Firearms and Explosives had exceeded its power when it prohibited the device by issuing
*  a rule that classified bump stocks as machine guns.
*  And tens of thousands of demonstrators crowded onto streets in France on Saturday to denounce
*  the rise of the country's far right as the nation prepared to vote in snap elections
*  set to take place later this month.
*  French President Emmanuel Macron shocked the country last week by announcing that he was
*  dissolving the lower house of parliament after his party was clobbered by far-right opponents
*  in a vote to seat the next European parliament.
*  Critics, including some in Macron's own party, warned that the president's move to call
*  snap elections opened the door to empowering the far right in France for the first time
*  since World War II.
