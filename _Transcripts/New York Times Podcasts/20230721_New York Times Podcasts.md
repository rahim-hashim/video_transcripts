*  From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Kietrowf. This is the Daily.
*  This weekend, with Hollywood and turmoil over declining ticket sales and a massive labor
*  strike, all eyes are turning to Barbie, a new film that is trying to pull off a seemingly
*  impossible task. That task is to take a doll best known for reinforcing conventional
*  stereotypes of women and somehow rebrand it as a symbol of feminism, all without coming
*  off as a shameless ad for the doll's maker, Mattel.
*  Today journalist Willa Paskin on her conversation with the film's director, Greta Gerwig, about
*  how she approached that challenge and why America remains so endlessly fascinated by Barbie.
*  It's Friday, July 21st.
*  Willa, you wrote about Barbie and the making of Barbie, the film for The New York Times
*  magazine, which is what we're here to talk about.
*  But just to start, talk to me about your relationship to Barbie.
*  I wish that I could say that I had a really intimate relationship with Barbie or a sort of
*  profound one, but I don't really. I played with Barbies when I was a kid, but I can't
*  say that they were particularly memorable. They were just one of many dolls. I probably
*  have thought about them more as a parent than I ever did as a child.
*  Why more is a mother? I'm not yet a mom, but I'm going to be soon.
*  So this could be useful for me.
*  I have felt that when it comes to Barbies resistance is sort of futile. I did not buy any
*  Barbies. That was sort of intentional. Yet there are, I think, over a dozen Barbies
*  in our house and how other people have purchased them and they've wandered into the house.
*  I think the statistic is something like 90% of three to 10-year-old girls own a Barbie.
*  In America, three to six-year-old girls, on average, they have 12 each. That's insane.
*  Yeah, I think this is like the thing about Barbie is like, you cannot escape Barbie and
*  there's an element of that that was true even before the movie. Barbie is a doll that has
*  existed for way, way, way, way longer than most alls for over six years and she's really
*  embedded in lots of really important ways we think about girlhood and womanhood.
*  So Barbie is also in my house. I think I don't know if it had just been up to me that I
*  would have let her in but I decided it was worse to make a deal out of it and so my kids
*  play with Barbie. It sounds like that this is maybe something you're not all together
*  overjoyed about but it's inevitable. So why invite more Barbie into your life? What seemed
*  interesting to you, Willa, about writing about Barbie the film?
*  Well, I mean, it was interested in all of these feelings about Barbie that I have and
*  I think actually a lot of people have and also how that plays into making a movie about
*  Barbie, which is this huge piece of IP. IP stands for intellectual property and it's basically
*  all Hollywood does now, which is to take something that people know already exists and make
*  a movie about it. Everything has to be pre-sold. It has to be a Marvel character. It has
*  to be some other toy and I think with most of those products or those movies, the thing
*  that's compelling about it is everybody knows them and lots of people love them, right?
*  And the thing about Barbie that's sort of interesting is that everybody knows Barbie
*  but not everybody loves Barbie. Barbie comes with a lot of baggage. So there are absolutely
*  people that love her but there are people who hate her and I was just really interested
*  in why you'd make a movie like that and how do you make a huge blockbuster entertainment
*  that's about something that people have such complicated feelings about.
*  Okay, so let's talk about those feelings. Where should we start in talking about the
*  complications of Barbie? Well, I think this goes right to Barbie's origin. So Barbie was
*  created by Ruth Handler who was a Jewish business woman who already co-owned a toy company
*  with her husband Elliot that was called Mattel that was founded in 1945 and sort of the
*  story like the origin story of Barbie is that she was sitting in a room, Eve's dropping
*  listening in on her daughter Barbara who was named Barbie playing with paper dolls with
*  a friend and they were just spending hours and hours putting these dolls in different
*  outfits and thinking about their futures and careers and just sort of like imagining
*  them as grown women and she realized that there was not a three-dimensional doll that let
*  girls do the same. There's basically only baby dolls that encourage them to practice
*  being moms and Ruth Handler was a business woman in 1945, you know, like she's talked
*  about not like loving being a housewife and I think she sort of was like we should
*  make this doll that let's girls explore all the different ways that they can be adults,
*  adult women that isn't just motherhood. So the story also goes that she was in Switzerland
*  on a trip, family trip and she came across this doll that's called the Bill the Lily.
*  It looks a ton like a Barbie because Barbie was modeled on it and it was at the time
*  this sort of doll that was based on a character in a German comic strip who was sort of like
*  a slatter and like a promiscuous harlot and this doll was sort of meant it was like an
*  accessory for grown men like it was well, you know, one of the things they could do it
*  was have in their car like sort of like playboy silhouette mud flaps and she saw this doll
*  that was like sort of like had this Vava loom figure but was sort of the right proportions
*  to dress and bought three one for her daughter and two for her and sort of took it back
*  to California as proof of concept and the doll came out in 1959 and basically became a
*  hit like right away.
*  If I'm getting this right, Barbie is the brainchild of a female executive who made the doll
*  after hearing her daughter imagining the careers of her paper dolls but this doll, Barbie,
*  is based on a sexy blonde German comic strip character.
*  There are a few contradictions there.
*  Right, the contradictions are like baked right in.
*  They never end and they run all through the 1960s.
*  In the 1960s you see things like Barbie gets a dream house and even a sliding door that
*  really opened.
*  And she gets a dream house in 1962 like when women couldn't like was very rare for women
*  to be able to get credit cards and their own mortgages.
*  And she goes to the moon as an astronaut before a Neil Armstrong ever goes to the moon.
*  So all those things are happening and then at the same time there's a slumber party Barbie
*  that comes out in the mid 1960s and she comes with a scale that stuck at 110 pounds and
*  a book called the Hadelose Weight and the instructions are literally just don't eat.
*  That's horrible.
*  And also like going with that is sort of like the impossible proportions, this idea that
*  like she couldn't really stand because her breasts are too big.
*  Her head couldn't be held up because her neck is too slender.
*  Her liver couldn't fit inside of her body.
*  You know, like if this person were embodied, she couldn't be because it's impossible to
*  look like Barbie.
*  And this is sort of what we are giving to little girls to play with and holding up as
*  this model of what they can be when they grow up.
*  Yeah, you have all these kind of awful stereotypes and standards about women and their
*  bodies kind of baked into this doll while also having her occupy the oval office.
*  Right, exactly.
*  You know, so by the 1970s when the feminist movement is really taking off, this sort of
*  critique of Barbie solidifies as just like, no, this is everything society and men want
*  us to be this sort of like glammed up male gay is ready, hot to try, blonde, thin, high
*  healed woman.
*  And women are so much more than that, this is so limiting.
*  And there's a march in 1970, you know, like an equity march and women are marching saying,
*  like we are not a Barbie doll.
*  How did Mattel respond to all this feminist critique?
*  I mean, I think they basically sort of brushed to the side.
*  There were some minor changes like in the early 70s, Barbie initially always her eyes had
*  been sort of downcast into the side.
*  And in the early 70s, she starts to look out at you like she becomes a subject, not
*  an object, which is tied to the existence of the feminist movement.
*  I think even if they wouldn't have said that.
*  But basically like they just continued the doll kept selling like they just didn't have
*  to take it seriously.
*  They were the only doll like this on the market.
*  Barbie was just sort of indomitable.
*  And that continued into the 2000s.
*  And then basically in the 2000s, the contradictions that were always inherent in Barbie sort of became
*  unsustainable.
*  But you start to see initially is like the existence of their first real competitor,
*  which were Bratz dolls.
*  Like Barbie just sort of started to lose its footing.
*  And by the mid 2010s, it was actually very dire.
*  Like Mattel's own research about it was really bad.
*  People thought the doll was vapid and stand for anything.
*  They saw that mothers weren't comfortable giving Barbies as birthday presents.
*  And like, you know, birthday presents is sort of supposed to be a reflection of your
*  values and moms were feeling uncomfortable mirroring Barbie.
*  And then there was other really incredible anecdote, which is that there was a study not done
*  by Mattel that found that when little girls played with Barbies, they sought themselves
*  less capable of a number of careers than they did after playing with a Mrs. Potato Head.
*  It was like the control in the study.
*  So Barbies association with a very particular way of being a woman started to sort of be
*  a problem for them in a way that had been lurking for decades, but sort of really like came
*  to the surface.
*  And I think they were like actually for the first time, existentially worried about the future
*  of the doll.
*  So what does Mattel do about this existential threat?
*  They change.
*  They realize they have to change.
*  So they start to, in 2015, they start to roll out a lot of different Barbies.
*  They roll out more than 100 different hairs and skin colors and they make Barbies feet
*  flat.
*  And then in 2016, they start to, they released three different shaped Barbies, like a
*  Kirby Barbie, a petite Barbie, a tall Barbie.
*  They release Barbies based on feminist trailblazers.
*  So like you have a Billie Jean King Barbie and a Rosa Parks Barbie.
*  And so all of these changes put Barbie on better footing, but Mattel, the parent company
*  was still really struggling.
*  Mattel is a huge company.
*  They own a lot of different toy brands, like Fisher prices them hot wheels.
*  Like there's a lot of toys that Mattel makes.
*  And in the mid 2010s, they were really struggling.
*  And by 2018, they gone through three CEOs.
*  They had lost half a billion dollars.
*  And it's at that point that they hired a man named Enon Crise who is a Israeli born businessman
*  who's background is not in toys, but is in entertainment.
*  And like crucially to the existence of the Barbie movie, he had like a very straightforward
*  plan for what to do, which is basically cost and sort of sort out the back end of what
*  was going on at Mattel.
*  And also to stop thinking about themselves as a manufacturing company and to think about
*  themselves instead as an IP company that manages franchises.
*  So to answer this fundamental question that you've asked, which is why make a Barbie movie,
*  this is kind of it.
*  Mattel is trying to pivot into becoming a company that is about selling their IP.
*  And they also need a brand reinvention.
*  They want to try to sell Barbie to 2023 women.
*  Yeah, I mean, I should say here that Mattel had been trying to make a Barbie movie since
*  2009, but because Barbie is this contradictory character that people have strong feelings
*  about, they kind of knew they had to thread this needle, right?
*  Where it's like, you can't do a satire of Barbie, right?
*  Because like that's not going to sell Barbie.
*  But you kind of can't just also do the propaganda Barbie because they couldn't have it be boring.
*  So they had to like kind of figure out something slightly outside the box.
*  And also because of Barbie's baggage, they wanted, they needed a woman to do it.
*  They needed a woman with credibility to do it.
*  And so about six weeks into his new tenure as CEO, Yunnan Kriz, took a meeting with Margot
*  Robby, the actress who had been keeping an eye on the Barbie rights for a long time and
*  had a relationship with Warner Brothers.
*  And they had a meeting and they decided they wanted to make Barbie.
*  And they put together the short list of directors that they wanted to do it.
*  And at the top of it was the director of Greta Gerwig.
*  And why Greta Gerwig?
*  Well, so Greta Gerwig became known to the American public at large as an actress.
*  Patch is the kind of guy who buys a black leather tout and is like, I love it.
*  She was originally in a set of movies that are sort of goofily called mumble-core movies,
*  but are sort of like smaller independent, realistic, chatty, slice of life movies.
*  And she kind of had her breakout in a movie that she made with her partner Noah Bombak
*  called Francis Ha.
*  It's so funny when people have kids and they're all, I used to be so focused on me and now
*  I'm totally not.
*  It's like, no.
*  It's still you.
*  It's half you.
*  It's a mini-you.
*  I mean, you made it.
*  She had became a director in 2017 with Lady Bird.
*  Lady Bird.
*  Is that your given name?
*  Yeah.
*  Why is it in quote?
*  Well, I gave it to myself.
*  It's given to me by me.
*  OK.
*  A great movie, those sort of based on her coming of age in Sacramento.
*  Those nominated for Oscars and then she sort of leveled up and did an adaptation of Little
*  Women, which was also really well received.
*  And if I had my own money, which I don't, that money would belong to my husband the moment
*  we got married.
*  And if we had children, they would be his, not mine.
*  They would be his property.
*  So don't sit there and tell me that marriage isn't an economic proposition because it is.
*  So she's like this really smart creative person with Oscar nominations and indie credentials
*  and feminist credentials.
*  And they approached her about doing the Barbie movie.
*  So I can't understand why Mattel would want to have this smart Oscar nominated female
*  director make this movie.
*  And my question is, why would this young Oscar nominated indie filmmaker who is seen
*  as someone who makes movies about women's voices in a kind of 2023 way?
*  Why would she want to make a movie about Barbie?
*  Natalie, that is exactly what I wanted to know.
*  And so when I met up with her, that's what I got to ask her.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Willa tell us about this meeting with Greta Gerwig and why she decided to make this movie.
*  Sure.
*  So I met Greta at a production studio in Midtown, Manhattan.
*  But we can keep going right now too.
*  If you don't mind, I just want to have like a-
*  And we sort of just sat at a table in a nice office space.
*  I actually had brought some Barbies of my children's, it's like props.
*  I thought maybe something interesting would happen.
*  And like I started with where you sort of start, right?
*  Which is like, did you play with them when you were little?
*  I did what's your relationship to Barbie and growing grew up in Sacramento and she loved
*  Jal's.
*  I loved Jal's in general and I did love Barbie.
*  She has a sort of sense memory of standing in a toy's arous like beholding Barbies.
*  And there was something about like the really big box that's meant a really big dress with
*  a really big hair.
*  I loved looking at them.
*  She played with them.
*  She says it was too late, like until she was about 14.
*  They knew because people were already drinking at parties.
*  Yeah.
*  And I was like, you are not cool.
*  I remember what it was like to kind of begin to go through puberty and suddenly dolls
*  are not magical anymore and everything about you feels wrong.
*  And at the same time, she was also aware of like the critique of Barbie because her mother
*  was not wild about Barbies for all of the feminist reasons we've already discussed.
*  So like most of them just sort of crept into the house as Barbies have a tendency to do
*  as like hand me downs.
*  So Greta's mom may be a skeptic, but Greta is enamored with them.
*  She's a fan.
*  I mean, I think it's complicated.
*  Like I think she will tell you that she loves Barbie, but I don't think it's because
*  she can't see that there's complications to Barbie.
*  And I think it was actually that Barbie is this contradictory complex symbol that is what
*  interested in her.
*  So obviously she had to like feel warmly enough about the doll from a tell to feel comfortable
*  like having her do this.
*  You know, they're not signing their prize property over to just someone who's going to like
*  tear it apart, but it's not that she doesn't understand that there is a complex conversation
*  that's been going on about Barbie for a long time.
*  I mean, she said to me like people ask what's the story about Barbie and the story about
*  Barbie is the fight that we've been having about Barbie.
*  I don't think that wasn't important to her.
*  So does that tension inform the way Greta is thinking about actually making the film?
*  I think so.
*  Like I think she talks about Margot Robbie coming to see her.
*  That's when I am going to really sit down and start trying to wrap my head around what
*  is this because I am like not knowing what it was going to be at all.
*  I had very much that sense of the panic of like a blank canvas.
*  But just knowing that like a kind of needed to deal with the conflict around Barbie.
*  I wasn't sure how I was going to go about it.
*  And I started reading a lot and researching a lot about like...
*  She ended up reading about Ruth Handler who we talked about who in addition to creating
*  Barbie ended up having breast cancer and would go on to have two mastectomies.
*  And for the woman who invented Barbie to have a double mastectomy because she had breast
*  cancer, I thought there was something like so incredibly human and poignant about that.
*  Even this is some idea of big breasted perfection.
*  Something about that like was a point of entry for her.
*  There was something quite beautiful to me of like taking something that is like the Queen
*  of Plastic and giving her something real or taking something that could be you know corporate
*  behemoth and making it something so tangible and homemade and personal and charming and
*  committed and surreal and strange.
*  It was like the most satisfying flipping of it.
*  And I suppose that felt worth it to me.
*  So for Greta there's really two things going on here that are really driving her decision
*  to do this.
*  The first is that she doesn't have quite as much baggage attached to Barbie as some people
*  do.
*  The second is that she really sees that as an artist she has the opportunity to do something
*  interesting with Barbie.
*  Yeah, I think that's right.
*  But will it there's also something else here too right?
*  I mean making Barbie the movie this summer blockbuster.
*  It's obviously the chance for this filmmaker to be behind something huge.
*  Yeah, I mean I think she was like very matter of fact about that.
*  She is like consciously leveling up as like a director as an artist as a business woman
*  in Hollywood.
*  Like she is very conscious that to kind of get better at what she does and what she's interested
*  in she has like keep making bigger and bigger movies.
*  So she has like more expertise and more experience.
*  This movie has a hundred million dollar bigger budget that little women which had like double
*  the budget of Lady Bird.
*  And also the thing is like, girl, I can describe this as like a both and kind of experience.
*  And I think that is true and it extends to her and Mattel which is that like their interest
*  really genuinely aligned here like she wanted to make a movie about this subject.
*  She wanted to be a big movie and they needed somebody like her to do that and to like make
*  that appealing like they gave her an extraordinary amount of creative freedom which is like unusual
*  almost for any director and like particularly for a female director.
*  They gave her just a lot of latitude with a really big project.
*  Can you give me a few examples of what that actually looks like of what it looks like
*  to have, Greta Gerwig make a Barbie movie with creative freedom?
*  So I want to kind of like answer that question in two ways.
*  And one is just to say like very quickly set up the movie with this little spoilers as
*  I possibly can.
*  But basically like in the movie there's Barbie land and there is the real world and
*  Barbie land is plastic and pink and everything is perfect and the real world is the real
*  world.
*  And through a series of mishaps Barbie ends up in the real world and has to learn a bunch
*  of things.
*  But Gerwig and her colleagues like really nerded out on like the granular details of Barbie
*  land like obsessed about every detail and like really really wanted it all to be tangible
*  and touchable and feel like the toy you know like fake but real.
*  And they obsessed about every detail.
*  And then there's also like what does it mean creative freedom like someone says you're
*  making a movie from a town in Warner Brothers you know it's a big project there's lots of
*  collaborators there's always going to be notes and feedbacks or suggestions about scenes
*  that would be cut for time.
*  I was like I can't cut that this whole thing that's for me.
*  I remember saying this to the student or someone and someone I was like if I cut that scene
*  I don't know why I'm making this movie.
*  If I don't have that scene I don't know what it is or what I've done.
*  But my sense is that she was like pleasantly puzzled and surprised by like how much she
*  was allowed to do her thing.
*  It's like use this assignment to go wild and to make something beautiful and big and
*  and our kick.
*  As a filmmaker it is those moments of like getting to work with an IP like Barbie that you
*  do get the ability to make something insane.
*  Also a little bit like I was getting away with something.
*  Without spoilers I'm wondering with all this creative license that she has does the film
*  address all of those complications baked into Barbie that we've been talking about.
*  I mean it certainly addresses some of them like there's a scene in the movie where like
*  a character delivers to Barbie like the entire critique of Barbie that she's been making
*  women feel bad for 50 years.
*  But I think that Gerwig was interested also in humanizing Barbie.
*  This is sort of like the slippery, traumatic trick of the movie which is a kind of like
*  sidesteps the extent to which Barbie might still be playing some part in making little girls
*  feel like they have to look a certain way or be a certain size or be a certain kind of
*  woman.
*  And I think the way that Gerwig sort of sidesteped that is because I think she thinks about
*  the whole movie is like almost like metatextually like writing the wrongs of Barbie.
*  She talked about this explicitly like if Barbie has made people feel bad like they're
*  not good enough the only thing I could think to do was to make people feel good enough.
*  But obviously that does like sidestep this part of the doll right.
*  She has historically done this and may still be doing this even if she's not doing it
*  in the movie.
*  And did you ask her about that side stepping do you know if she did that on purpose?
*  I mean, I think she was like is very aware that she's making like a fun summer movie.
*  And so I think she sort of was like this isn't supposed to be a lecture.
*  And so she she knows like all of the faux pas.
*  I think she felt like getting into every single one was sort of like pulling the whole
*  thing down and sort of needed to be like more buoyant and life and like a movie people
*  want to see.
*  And it seems fair to say that maybe it's too much to expect of a summer blockbuster
*  like this to get into all of that.
*  But at the end of the day humanizing Barbie is also obviously hugely beneficial for
*  Mattel right.
*  I mean, this kind of works out for them.
*  This is a rebrand of Barbie.
*  It has us all talking about the doll and it's kind of sending us this message that this
*  complicated version of Barbie that we had all of this baggage attached to is not the
*  real story here.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it's a win win.
*  Like I think everyone I'm gonna tell is really really happy about the film.
*  And I think for like people of a certain age, this idea that like you can make something
*  that would sell some other product is like distasteful.
*  But the fact is that like so many movies are that now and additionally like Star Wars,
*  which was based on original idea is that now.
*  And so it gets harder and harder to sort of draw some hard line in the sand about what's
*  like really it can you shouldn't do if you're an artist and what you should.
*  And like I think basically it's like if you're interested in the thing you're making and
*  if actually turns out 98% of people in the world know it and are interested in are gonna
*  be like hyped to see what you did like those are all really compelling reasons to make
*  something for a filmmaker now I think of any gender or stature.
*  Right.
*  There's a way in which she's just making a very pragmatic decision as a young ambitious
*  filmmaker and Hollywood right now.
*  Right.
*  Well, you've been saying this has been a win win for Greta Gerwig and for Mattel, but
*  the movie is just about to come out.
*  How do we know it's a success?
*  So you're totally right.
*  Like I can now see the future.
*  I do not know how much money this movie is gonna make it is tracking to make $150 million
*  or so dollars, which is like triple what it was supposed to make like even three weeks
*  ago.
*  And so much of that is like because of just the wall to wall barbie everything, which is
*  all being driven by the movie.
*  I mean like it is insanely and escapable right now.
*  It's like at pinkberry.
*  It's at the gap.
*  I mean, it's selling insurance.
*  It's selling candles.
*  I mean, this is part of like the whole plan on Mattel's side of like how this was gonna
*  work that it's like going to put the doll in front of everybody, but not just the doll,
*  right?
*  Like the whole brand, it's gonna be for people that aren't just kids.
*  It's gonna like hugely expand its demographic appeal.
*  And like that is what they wanted to happen.
*  And there's always people that are gonna find that eye rolling and always people who are
*  gonna want in.
*  And this is like why barbie is powerful.
*  You know, she's 60 years old and every single person in the world knows who she is.
*  And that's feelings about her and like that's just sort of irresistible at this moment
*  in time for everyone who makes stuff to get a piece of.
*  Yeah, I mean, just in making this episode, I googled Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig
*  and Google turned pink and sparkly.
*  Barbie has taken over Google.
*  Yes, of course it has.
*  What hasn't it taken over?
*  So this movie has kind of put barbie back into the spotlight, into the white hot center
*  of things with all of her contradictions and baggage.
*  It sounds like you're not gonna be getting rid of your barbies in your house any time
*  soon.
*  I mean, who could get rid of their barbies right now?
*  Impossible.
*  Willa, thanks for coming on the show.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Thursday, Russia launched a third day of aerial attacks on Ukraine's ports that appeared
*  to be aimed at crippling the country's ability to export grain.
*  One of the attacks destroyed 60,000 tons of grain waiting to be loaded onto ships.
*  The assault comes just days after Russia withdrew from a year-long agreement that had
*  allowed Ukraine to ship its grain to dozens of countries despite a Russian naval blockade.
*  The U.S. now fears that Russia's next target will be civilianships carrying grain to and
*  from Ukraine.
