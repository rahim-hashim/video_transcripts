# Can Barbie Be Rebranded as a Feminist Icon?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWwIvTH_AUQ)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Ketroff.
*  This is The Daily.
*  This weekend, with Hollywood in turmoil over declining ticket sales and a massive labor
*  strike, all eyes are turning to Barbie, a new film that is trying to pull off a seemingly
*  impossible task.
*  That task is to take a doll best known for reinforcing conventional stereotypes of women
*  and somehow rebrand it as a symbol of feminism, all without coming off as a shameless ad for
*  the doll's maker, Mattel.
*  Today, journalist Willa Paskin on her conversation with the film's director, Greta Gerwig, about
*  how she approached that challenge and why America remains so endlessly fascinated by
*  Barbie.
*  It's Friday, July 21st.
*  Willa, you wrote about Barbie and the making of Barbie, the film, for the New York Times
*  Magazine, which is what we're here to talk about.
*  But just to start, talk to me about your relationship to Barbie.
*  I wish that I could say that I had a really intimate relationship with Barbie or a sort
*  of profound one, but I don't really.
*  I played with Barbies when I was a kid, but I can't say that they were particularly memorable.
*  They were just one of many dolls.
*  I probably have thought about them more as a parent than I ever did as a child.
*  Why more as a mother?
*  I'm not yet a mom, but I'm going to be soon, and so this could be useful for me.
*  Yeah, I have felt that when it comes to Barbie's resistance, it's sort of futile.
*  I did not buy any Barbies, and that was sort of intentional.
*  And yet there are, I think, over a dozen Barbies in our house now.
*  Other people have purchased them and they've wandered into the house.
*  I think the statistic is something like 90% of three to 10-year-old girls own a Barbie.
*  And in America, three to six-year-old girls, on average, they have 12 each.
*  That's insane.
*  Yeah, I think this is the thing about Barbie is like...
*  You cannot escape Barbie.
*  And there's an element of that that was true even before the movie.
*  Like...
*  Barbie is a doll that has existed for way, way, way, way longer than most dolls for,
*  you know, over six years.
*  And she's really like embedded in lots of really important ways we think about girlhood
*  and womanhood.
*  So Barbie is also in my house.
*  I think I don't know if it had just been up to me that I would have let her in,
*  but I decided it was worse to make a deal out of it.
*  And so my kids play with Barbie.
*  It sounds like this is maybe something you're not all together overjoyed about,
*  but it's inevitable.
*  So why invite more Barbie into your life?
*  What seemed interesting to you, Willa, about writing about Barbie the film?
*  Well, I mean, I was interested in all of these feelings about Barbie that I have
*  and that I think actually a lot of people have,
*  and also how that plays into making a movie about Barbie,
*  which is this huge piece of IP.
*  IP stands for intellectual property,
*  and it's basically all Hollywood does now,
*  which is to take something that people know already exists
*  and make a movie about it.
*  Everything has to be pre-sold, it has to be a Marvel character,
*  it has to be some other toy.
*  And I think with most of those products or those movies,
*  the thing that's compelling about it is everybody knows them
*  and lots of people love them, right?
*  And the thing about Barbie that's sort of interesting
*  is that everybody knows Barbie, but not everybody loves Barbie.
*  Like, Barbie comes with a lot of baggage,
*  so there are absolutely people that love her,
*  but there are people who hate her.
*  And I was just really interested in, like,
*  why you'd make a movie like that,
*  and how do you make a huge blockbuster entertainment
*  that's about something that people have
*  such complicated feelings about?
*  OK, so let's talk about those feelings.
*  Where should we start in talking about the complications of Barbie?
*  Well, I think this goes right to Barbie's origins.
*  So Barbie was created by Ruth Handler,
*  who was a Jewish businesswoman who already co-owned a toy company
*  with her husband, Elliot, that was called Mattel,
*  that was founded in 1945.
*  And sort of the story, like the origin story of Barbie,
*  is that she was sitting in a room, eavesdropping,
*  listening in on her daughter, Barbara, who was named Barbie,
*  playing with paper dolls with a friend.
*  And they were just spending hours and hours
*  putting these dolls in different outfits
*  and thinking about their futures and careers,
*  and just sort of, like, imagining them as grown women.
*  And she realized that there was not a three-dimensional doll
*  that let girls do the same.
*  There was basically only baby dolls
*  that encouraged them to practice being moms.
*  And Ruth Handler was a businesswoman in 1945, you know?
*  She's talked about not loving, being a housewife.
*  And I think she sort of was like,
*  we should make this doll that lets girls explore
*  all the different ways that they can be adults,
*  adult women that isn't just motherhood.
*  So the story also goes that she was in Switzerland
*  on a trip, a family trip,
*  and she came across this doll that's called the Build Lily.
*  It looks a ton like a Barbie, because Barbie was modeled on it.
*  And it was at the time, this sort of doll
*  that was based on a character in a German comic strip
*  who was sort of like a slattern, like a promiscuous harlot.
*  And this doll was sort of meant,
*  it was like an accessory for grown men.
*  Like it was, wow, you know,
*  one of the things they could do, it was having their car,
*  like sort of like Playboy silhouette mudflaps.
*  And she saw this doll that was like,
*  sort of like had this va-va-voom figure,
*  but was sort of the right proportions to dress
*  and bought three, one for her daughter and two for her,
*  and sort of took it back to California
*  as proof of concept.
*  And the doll came out in 1959
*  and basically became a hit like right away.
*  Barbie, you're beautiful.
*  You make me feel.
*  My Barbie doll is really real.
*  If I'm getting this right,
*  Barbie is the brainchild of a female executive
*  who made the doll after hearing her daughter
*  imagining the careers of her paper dolls.
*  But this doll, Barbie, is based on a sexy,
*  blonde German comic strip character.
*  It just, there are a few contradictions there.
*  Right, the contradictions are like baked right in.
*  They never end and they run all through the 1960s.
*  So.
*  What's going on here?
*  A housewarming.
*  Right.
*  Now Mattel's famous Barbie has a brand new dream house.
*  In the 1960s, you see things like Barbie gets a dream house.
*  And even a sliding door
*  that really opened.
*  And she gets a dream house in 1962,
*  like when women couldn't,
*  like it was very rare for women to be able to get credit cards
*  and their own mortgages.
*  Have you heard what's happened?
*  Barbie's changed.
*  And she goes to the moon as an astronaut
*  before Neil Armstrong ever goes to the moon.
*  So all those things are happening.
*  And then at the same time,
*  there's a slumber party Barbie that comes out
*  in the mid 1960s and she comes with a scale
*  that's stuck at 110 pounds and a book
*  called How to Lose Weight.
*  And the instructions are literally just don't eat.
*  That's horrible.
*  And also like going with that is sort of like
*  the impossible proportions.
*  This idea that like she couldn't really stand
*  because her breasts are too big.
*  Her head couldn't be held up because her neck is too slender.
*  Her liver couldn't fit inside of her body.
*  You know, like if this person were embodied,
*  she couldn't be because it's impossible to look like Barbie.
*  And this is sort of what we are giving to little girls
*  to play with and holding up as this model
*  of what they can be when they grow up.
*  Yeah, you have all these kind of awful stereotypes
*  and standards about women and their bodies
*  kind of baked into this doll
*  while also having her occupy the Oval Office.
*  Right, exactly.
*  Superstar body.
*  You know, so by the 1970s,
*  when the feminist movement is really taking off,
*  this sort of critique of Barbie solidifies
*  as just like, no, this is everything society and men
*  want us to be this sort of like glammed up, male gaze ready,
*  hot to trot, blonde, thin, high-heeled woman.
*  Superstar Barbie doll comes with necklace, earrings,
*  ring, shoes, and gown.
*  And women are so much more than that.
*  This is so limiting.
*  And there's a march in 1970, you know, like an equity march
*  and women are marching saying like, we are not a Barbie doll.
*  How did Mattel respond to all this feminist critique?
*  I mean, I think they basically sort of brushed it aside.
*  There were some minor changes like in the early 70s,
*  Barbie initially always her eyes had been sort of downcast
*  into the side.
*  And in the early 70s, she starts to look out at you.
*  Like she becomes a subject, not an object,
*  which is tied to the existence of the feminist movement,
*  I think, even if they wouldn't have said that.
*  But basically like they just continued,
*  the doll kept selling.
*  Like they just didn't have to take it seriously.
*  They were the only doll like this on the market.
*  Barbie was just sort of indomitable.
*  And that continued into the 2000s.
*  And then basically in the 2000s, the contradictions
*  that were always inherent in Barbie
*  sort of became unsustainable.
*  What you start to see initially is
*  like the existence of their first real competitor, which
*  were Bratz dolls.
*  Like Barbie just sort of started to lose its footing.
*  And by the mid 2010s, it was actually very dire.
*  Like Mattel's own research about it was really bad.
*  People thought the doll was vapid,
*  didn't stand for anything.
*  They saw that mothers weren't comfortable giving Barbies
*  as birthday presents.
*  And like birthday present is sort of
*  supposed to be a reflection of your values.
*  And moms were feeling uncomfortable mirroring Barbie.
*  And then there's this other really incredible anecdote,
*  which is that there was a study not done by Mattel that
*  found that when little girls played with Barbies,
*  they thought themselves less capable of a number of careers
*  than they did after playing with a Mrs. Potato
*  head, who was like the control and the study.
*  So Barbie's association with a very particular way
*  of being a woman started to sort of be a problem for them
*  in a way that had been lurking for decades,
*  but sort of really like came to the surface.
*  And I think they were like actually for the first time
*  existentially worried about the future of the doll.
*  So what does Mattel do about this existential threat?
*  They change.
*  They realize they have to change.
*  So they start to, in 2015, they start
*  to roll out a lot of different Barbies.
*  They roll out more than 100 different hairs and skin
*  colors.
*  And they make Barbies feet flat.
*  And then in 2016, they release three different shaped Barbies,
*  like a curvy Barbie, a petite Barbie, a tall Barbie.
*  They release Barbies based on feminist trail,
*  So like you have a Billie Jean King Barbie and a Rosa Parks
*  Barbie.
*  And so all of these changes put Barbie on better footing,
*  but Mattel, the parent company, was still really struggling.
*  Mattel is a huge company.
*  They own a lot of different toy brands,
*  like Fisher prices them, Hot Wheels.
*  Like there's a lot of toys that Mattel makes.
*  And in the mid-2010s, they were really struggling.
*  And by 2018, they'd gone through three CEOs.
*  They had lost half a billion dollars.
*  And it's at that point that they hired a man named Enon
*  Kries, who is a Israeli-born businessman whose background
*  is not in toys, but is in entertainment.
*  And like crucially to the existence of the Barbie movie,
*  he had like a very straightforward plan
*  for what to do, which is basically cut costs
*  and sort of sort out the back end of what
*  was going on at Mattel.
*  And also to stop thinking about themselves
*  as a manufacturing company and to think about themselves
*  instead as a manufacturing company.
*  And to think about themselves instead as an IP company
*  that manages franchises.
*  So to answer this fundamental question
*  that you've asked, which is why make a Barbie movie,
*  this is kind of it.
*  Mattel is trying to pivot into becoming a company that
*  is about selling their IP.
*  And they also need a brand reinvention.
*  They want to try to sell Barbie to 2023 women.
*  I should say here that Mattel had
*  been trying to make a Barbie movie since 2009.
*  But because Barbie is this contradictory character
*  that people have strong feelings about,
*  they kind of knew they had to thread this needle, right?
*  Where it's like you can't do a satire of Barbie, right?
*  Because that's not going to sell Barbie.
*  But you kind of can't just also do the propaganda Barbie,
*  because they couldn't have it be boring.
*  So they had to kind of figure out something slightly
*  outside the box.
*  And also, because of Barbie's baggage,
*  they needed a woman to do it.
*  They needed a woman with credibility to do it.
*  And so about six weeks into his new tenure as CEO,
*  Enan Kries took a meeting with Margot Robbie, the actress who
*  had been keeping an eye on the Barbie rights for a long time
*  and had a relationship with Warner Brothers.
*  And they had a meeting, and they decided
*  they wanted to make Barbie.
*  And they put together the short list of directors
*  that they wanted to do it.
*  And at the top of it was the director Greta Gerwig.
*  And why Greta Gerwig?
*  Well, so Greta Gerwig became known to the American public
*  at large as an actress.
*  Patch is the kind of guy who buys a black leather couch
*  and is like, I love it.
*  She was originally in a set of movies that are sort of goofily
*  called mumblecore movies, but are
*  sort of like smaller, independent, realistic, chatty
*  slice of life movies.
*  And she kind of had her breakout in a movie
*  that she made with her partner Noah Bombach called Francis Ha.
*  It's so funny when people have kids and they're all,
*  I used to be so focused on me, and now I'm totally not.
*  It's like, no, it's still you.
*  It's half you.
*  It's a mini you.
*  I mean, you made it.
*  She had became a director in 2017 with Lady Bird.
*  Lady Bird.
*  Is that your given name?
*  Yeah.
*  Why is it in quotes?
*  Well, I gave it to myself.
*  It's given to me by me.
*  OK.
*  It's a great movie that was sort of based on her coming of age
*  in Sacramento.
*  That was nominated for Oscars, and then she sort of leveled up
*  and did an adaptation of Little Women, which was also
*  really well received.
*  And if I had my own money, which I don't,
*  that money would belong to my husband
*  the moment we got married.
*  And if we had children, they would be his, not mine.
*  They would be his property.
*  So don't sit there and tell me that marriage
*  isn't an economic proposition because it is.
*  So she's like this really smart, creative person
*  with Oscar nominations and indie credentials
*  and feminist credentials.
*  And they approached her about doing the Barbie movie.
*  So I can understand why Mattel would
*  want to have this smart, Oscar nominated female director
*  make this movie.
*  But my question is, why would this young, Oscar nominated
*  indie filmmaker who is seen as someone who makes movies
*  about women's voices in a kind of 2023 way,
*  why would she want to make a movie about Barbie?
*  Natalie, that is exactly what I wanted to know.
*  And so when I met up with her, that's what I got to ask her.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Willa, tell us about this meeting with Greta Gerwig
*  and why she decided to make this movie.
*  Sure.
*  So I met Greta at a production studio in Midtown Manhattan.
*  But we can keep going right now, too.
*  If you don't mind, I just want to.
*  And we sort of sat at a table in a nice office space.
*  I actually had bronchitis.
*  And I was like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.
*  And I was like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.
*  And I was like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.
*  And I was like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.
*  I actually had brought some Barbies of my children's
*  as like props.
*  I thought maybe something interesting would happen.
*  And it started with where you sort of start, right?
*  Did you play with them when you were little?
*  What's your relationship to Barbie?
*  And Grewig grew up in Sacramento.
*  And she loved dolls.
*  I love dolls in general.
*  And I did love Barbie.
*  She has a sort of sense memory of standing in a Toys R Us,
*  beholding Barbies.
*  And there was something about the really big box
*  that's meant a really big dress with really big hair.
*  I loved looking at them.
*  She played with them.
*  She says it was too late, like until she was about 14.
*  Because I knew because people were already
*  drinking at parties.
*  And I was like, you are not cool.
*  I remember what it was like to kind of begin
*  to go through puberty.
*  And suddenly, dolls are not magical anymore.
*  And everything about you feels wrong.
*  And at the same time, she was also
*  aware of the critique of Barbie.
*  Because her mother was not wild about Barbies
*  for all of the feminist reasons we've already discussed.
*  So most of them just sort of crept into the house,
*  as Barbies have a tendency to do as hand-me-downs.
*  So Greta's mom may be a skeptic.
*  But Greta is enamored with them.
*  She's a fan.
*  I mean, I think it's complicated.
*  I think she will tell you that she loves Barbie.
*  But I don't think it's because she can't see that there's
*  complications to Barbie.
*  And I think it was actually that Barbie
*  is this contradictory complex symbol that
*  is what interested her.
*  So obviously, she had to feel warmly enough about the doll
*  for Mattel to feel comfortable having her do this.
*  They're not signing their prize property over to just someone
*  who's going to tear it apart.
*  But it's not that she doesn't understand
*  that there is a complex conversation that's
*  been going on about Barbie for a long time.
*  I mean, she said to me, people ask,
*  what's the story about Barbie?
*  And the story about Barbie is the fight
*  that we've been having about Barbie.
*  I don't think that wasn't important to her.
*  So does that tension inform the way
*  Greta is thinking about actually making the film?
*  I think so.
*  I think she talks about Margot Robbie coming to see her.
*  That's when I am going to really sit down and start
*  trying to wrap my head around, what is this?
*  And not knowing what it was going to be at all.
*  I had very much that sense of the panic of a blank canvas.
*  But just knowing that it needed to deal
*  with the conflict around Barbie.
*  I wasn't sure how I was going to go about it.
*  And I started reading a lot and researching a lot about like.
*  She ended up reading about Ruth Handler, who we talked about,
*  who in addition to creating Barbie,
*  ended up having breast cancer and would go on
*  to have two mastectomies.
*  And for the woman who invented Barbie
*  to have a double mastectomy because she had breast cancer,
*  I thought there was something like so incredibly human
*  and poignant about that, given that this is some idea
*  of big breasted perfection.
*  Something about that like was a point of entry for her.
*  There was something quite beautiful to me
*  of like taking something that is like the queen of plastic
*  and giving her something real or taking something
*  that could be a corporate behemoth
*  and making it something so tangible and homemade
*  and personal and charming and committed
*  and surreal and strange that it was like
*  the most satisfying flipping of it.
*  And I suppose that felt worth it to me.
*  Worth it to me.
*  Yeah.
*  So for Greta, there's really two things going on here
*  that are really driving her decision to do this.
*  The first is that she doesn't have quite as much baggage
*  attached to Barbie as some people do.
*  And the second is that she really sees that as an artist,
*  she has the opportunity to do something
*  interesting with Barbie.
*  Yeah, I think that's right.
*  But Willa, there's also something else here too, right?
*  I mean, making Barbie the movie this summer blockbuster,
*  it's obviously the chance for this filmmaker
*  to be behind something huge.
*  Yeah, I mean, I think she was like very matter of fact
*  about that.
*  She is like consciously leveling up as like a director,
*  as an artist, as a business woman in Hollywood.
*  Like she is very conscious that to kind of get better
*  at what she does and what she's interested in,
*  she has to keep making bigger and bigger movies.
*  So she has more expertise and more experience.
*  This movie has $100 million bigger budget than Little Women,
*  which had like double the budget of Lady Bird.
*  And also the thing is like,
*  Greta can describe this as like a both and kind of experience.
*  And I think that is true.
*  And it extends to her and Mattel,
*  which is that their interests really genuinely aligned here.
*  Like she wanted to make a movie about this subject.
*  She wanted to be a big movie.
*  And they needed somebody like her to do that
*  and to like make that appealing.
*  Like they gave her an extraordinary amount
*  of creative freedom, which is like unusual
*  almost for any director.
*  And like particularly for a female director,
*  they gave her just a lot of latitude
*  with a really big project.
*  Can you give me a few examples
*  of what that actually looks like,
*  of what it looks like to have Greta Gerwig
*  make a Barbie movie with creative freedom?
*  So I wanna kind of like answer that question in two ways.
*  And one is just to say like very quickly set up the movie
*  with as little spoilers as I possibly can.
*  But basically like in the movie, there's Barbie land
*  and there is the real world.
*  And Barbie land is plastic and pink
*  and everything is perfect.
*  And the real world is the real world.
*  And through a series of mishaps,
*  Barbie ends up in the real world
*  and has to learn a bunch of things.
*  But Gerwig and her colleagues like really nerded out
*  the granular details of Barbie land,
*  like obsessed about every detail
*  and like really, really wanted it all to be tangible
*  and touchable and feel like the toy,
*  like fake but real.
*  And I remember we were looking at all these different panels
*  of painted skies because I wanted everything
*  to be authentically artificial.
*  And they obsessed about every detail.
*  Is there water?
*  No, is there wind?
*  Only if it makes their hair look good.
*  Is it, you know.
*  And then there's also like,
*  what does it mean creative freedom?
*  Like someone says, you're making a movie
*  for Mattel and Warner Brothers.
*  You know, it's a big project.
*  There's lots of collaborators.
*  There's always gonna be notes and feedback.
*  There were suggestions about scenes
*  that would be cut for time.
*  I was like, I can't cut that.
*  That's the whole thing.
*  That's for me.
*  I remember saying this to the studio
*  or someone at some point I was like,
*  if I cut that scene,
*  I don't know why I'm making this movie.
*  If I don't have that scene,
*  I don't know what it is or what I've done.
*  But my sense is that she was like pleasantly puzzled
*  and surprised by like how much
*  she was allowed to do her thing.
*  It's like, use this assignment to go wild
*  and to make something beautiful and big and anarchic.
*  As a filmmaker, it is those moments
*  of like getting to work with an IP like Barbie
*  that you do get the ability to make something insane.
*  Also a little bit like I was getting away with something.
*  And without spoilers,
*  I'm wondering with all this creative license that she has,
*  does the film address all of those complications
*  baked into Barbie that we've been talking about?
*  I mean, it certainly addresses some of them.
*  Like there's a scene in the movie
*  where like a character delivers to Barbie,
*  like the entire critique of Barbie,
*  that she's been making women feel bad for 50 years.
*  But I think that Gerwig was interested also
*  in humanizing Barbie.
*  This is sort of like the slippery magic trick of the movie,
*  which is it kind of like sidesteps the extent
*  to which Barbie might still be playing some part
*  in making little girls feel like they have to look
*  a certain way or be a certain size
*  or be a certain kind of woman.
*  And I think the way that Gerwig sort of sidestepped that
*  is because I think she thinks about the whole movie
*  as like almost like meta textually,
*  like writing the wrongs of Barbie.
*  Like she talked about this explicitly.
*  Like if Barbie has made people feel bad,
*  like they're not good enough,
*  the only thing I could think to do
*  was to make people feel good enough.
*  But obviously that does like sidestep
*  this part of the doll, right?
*  She has historically done this and may still be doing this,
*  even if she's not doing it in the movie.
*  And did you ask her about that sidestepping?
*  Do you know if she did that on purpose?
*  I mean, I think she was like,
*  is very aware that she's making like a fun summer movie.
*  And so I think she sort of was like,
*  this isn't supposed to be a lecture.
*  And so she knows like all of the faux pas.
*  I think she felt like getting into every single one
*  was sort of like pulling the whole thing down
*  and sort of needed to be like more buoyant and life
*  and like a movie people wanna see.
*  And it seems fair to say that maybe it's too much to expect
*  of a summer blockbuster like this to get into all of that.
*  But at the end of the day,
*  humanizing Barbie is also obviously hugely beneficial
*  for Mattel, right?
*  I mean, this kind of works out for them.
*  This is a rebrand of Barbie.
*  It has us all talking about the doll
*  and it's kind of sending us this message
*  of this complicated version of Barbie
*  that we had all of this baggage attached to
*  is not the real story here.
*  Yeah, I think it's a win-win.
*  Like I think everyone at Mattel
*  is really, really happy about the film.
*  And I think for like people of a certain age,
*  this idea that like you can make something
*  that would sell some other product is like distasteful,
*  but the fact is that like so many movies are that now.
*  And additionally, like Star Wars,
*  which was based on the original idea is that now.
*  And so it gets harder and harder to sort of draw
*  some hard line in the sand about what's like really icky
*  and you shouldn't do if you're an artist and what you should.
*  And like, I think basically it's like,
*  if you are interested in the thing you're making,
*  and if actually it turns out 98% of people in the world
*  know it and are interested in it
*  and are gonna be like hyped to see what you did.
*  Like those are all really compelling reasons
*  to make something for a filmmaker now, I think,
*  of any gender or stature.
*  Right, there's a way in which she's just making
*  a very pragmatic decision as a young ambitious filmmaker
*  in Hollywood right now.
*  Right.
*  Willow, you've been saying this has been a win-win
*  for Greta Gerwig and for Mattel,
*  but the movie is just about to come out.
*  How do we know it's a success?
*  So you're totally right.
*  Like I cannot see the future.
*  I do not know how much money this movie is gonna make.
*  It is tracking to make 150 million or so dollars,
*  which is like triple what it was supposed to make
*  like even three weeks ago.
*  And so much of that is like because of just the wall
*  to wall Barbie everything,
*  which is all being driven by the movie.
*  I mean, like it is insanely inescapable right now.
*  It's like at Pinkberry, it's at the Gap.
*  I mean, it's selling insurance.
*  It's selling candles.
*  I mean, this is part of like the whole plan on Mattel's side
*  of like how this was gonna work.
*  That it's like going to put the doll in front of everybody,
*  but not just the doll, right?
*  Like the whole brand,
*  it's gonna be for people that aren't just kids.
*  It's gonna like hugely expand its demographic appeal.
*  And like that is what they wanted to happen.
*  And there's always people that are gonna find
*  that eye rolling and always people who are gonna want in.
*  And this is like why Barbie is powerful.
*  You know, she's six years old
*  and every single person in the world knows
*  who she is and has feelings about her.
*  And like, that's just sort of irresistible
*  at this moment in time for everyone who makes stuff
*  to get a piece of.
*  Yeah, I mean, just in making this episode,
*  I Googled Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig
*  and Google turned pink and sparkly.
*  Barbie has taken over Google.
*  Yes, of course it has.
*  What hasn't it taken over?
*  ["Sweet Home Alone"]
*  ["Sweet Home Alone"]
*  So this movie has kind of put Barbie back
*  into the spotlight, into the white hot center of things
*  with all of her contradictions and baggage.
*  It sounds like you're not gonna be getting rid
*  of your Barbies in your house anytime soon.
*  I mean, who could get rid of their Barbies right now?
*  Impossible.
*  ["Sweet Home Alone"]
*  Willa, thanks for coming on the show.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  ["Sweet Home Alone"]
*  We'll be right back.

*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Thursday, Russia launched a third of the world's
*  On Thursday, Russia launched a third day
*  of aerial attacks on Ukraine's ports
*  that appeared to be aimed at crippling the country's ability
*  to export grain.
*  One of the attacks destroyed 60,000 tons of grain
*  waiting to be loaded onto ships.
*  The assault comes just days after Russia withdrew
*  from a year-long agreement that had allowed Ukraine
*  to ship its grain to dozens of countries
*  despite a Russian naval blockade.
*  The US now fears that Russia's next target
*  will be civilian ships carrying grain to and from Ukraine.
