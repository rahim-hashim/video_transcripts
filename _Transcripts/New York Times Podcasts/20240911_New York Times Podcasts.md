# Harris Baits Trump Inside Their Fiery Debate
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JDBK1t-xo)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Boborjo.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, in their first and possibly only presidential debate, Kamala Harris dominated and enraged
*  Donald Trump and made a night that could have been about her record, instead into a night
*  about his temperament.
*  My colleague, political correspondent Jonathan Swan, walks us through how it unfolded.
*  It's Wednesday, September 11th.
*  Jonathan, good evening.
*  Michael, how are you?
*  I'm okay.
*  I mean, it's late.
*  It's very late.
*  It is damn near midnight and we appreciate you being willing to stay up with us.
*  Always happy to be here.
*  So Jonathan, this debate was described beforehand by you in the paper of record in the Times
*  as the most important 90 minutes in American politics in generations.
*  So I just want to ask you why even before it began, in your estimation, it merited that
*  string of superlatives?
*  Well, now you say it.
*  I think we might have gone a bit overboard on that because the Biden debate, you know,
*  and he dropped out.
*  So that probably that one goes down, you know, no, I'm being a little facetious.
*  Look, the reason it was so unusually important is that so rarely these days do you have a
*  candidate that there are so many voters who are still curious about them and haven't made
*  up their minds about them and what more hungry for more information about them that they're
*  still very malleable in terms of voter opinion, as Kamala Harris is right now, that you cannot
*  find a voter in America who doesn't have an opinion about Donald Trump.
*  It's very, very hard to anyway, but somewhere in the realm of 30 percent of voters want
*  to know more about Kamala Harris, are curious about her, want to see if she presents as
*  plausible as a commander in chief, want to see what her ideas are for dealing with inflation
*  in the economy and are generally up for grabs.
*  So both sides, both the Trump campaign and the Harris campaign, viewed this debate in
*  almost exactly the same way, which was it is an opportunity to define Kamala Harris
*  for that slice of undecided voters in the seven key battleground states that are going
*  to decide this election.
*  And how in your mind were each of these candidates hoping to do that very specific task, define
*  Vice President Harris here?
*  Well, the Trump team had a very clear goal.
*  He spent quite a lot of time preparing for this debate.
*  Their goal was to force Kamala Harris to own her partnership with Joe Biden, a very unpopular
*  president, and force her to own the most unpopular aspects of his record, of their record in
*  office, in particular, high prices, the situation at the southern border, chaos around the world.
*  What they were trying to avoid is for her to present herself as the change candidate.
*  They want her to be seen as the incumbent, as someone who is a fixture of the current
*  leadership in this country that undecided voters are very, very frustrated with.
*  On her side, their job was to present the exact opposite, was to present herself without
*  throwing Joe Biden under the bus completely, but a break, something new, the future, an
*  optimistic breath of fresh air.
*  Trump is the past, a change candidate in a change election, and also to present herself
*  as someone that people could see as being a president or a commander in chief, someone
*  who passes what Trump has thought of as the plausibility test.
*  So that's how each side saw the debate going into it.
*  And I wonder who you think accomplished those objectives best.
*  She did.
*  That's about as short an answer as I've ever received on the show.
*  And we're going to make you explain that.
*  So let's talk about what actually happened during these 90 minutes of this debate and
*  how those two strategies, in her case, it seems, did play out and his perhaps didn't.
*  Take us into the debate room.
*  So let's now welcome the candidates to the stage, Vice President Kamala Harris and President
*  Donald Trump.
*  Well, the first moment that struck me was right at the beginning when she walked over
*  to Donald Trump.
*  Kamala Harris, let's have a good debate.
*  Have fun.
*  Thank you.
*  And shook his hand.
*  Welcome to you both.
*  It's wonderful to have you.
*  It's an honor to have you both here tonight.
*  Which might seem unremarkable, but in the context of Trump and debates, it was sort
*  of a power move.
*  There was all of this discussion behind the scenes before Trump's debate with Biden, where
*  Trump was discussing with his advisors, should I shake his hand?
*  Shouldn't I shake his hand?
*  I mean, Trump is someone who thinks a lot about visuals, about optics, about domination,
*  things like that.
*  So it's definitely something that he would have thought about.
*  I don't know what his thinking was going into this particular debate, but that was a move
*  that I thought, oh, interesting.
*  She's come here to play and perhaps also come here to try to get under his skin a little
*  bit.
*  Right.
*  The get go, literally before a word is uttered.
*  Yeah.
*  And then we get the first question.
*  I want to begin tonight with the issue that voters repeatedly say is their number one
*  issue, and that is the economy and the cost of living in this country.
*  The ABC moderator, David Muir, asks Kamala Harris, the question that Donald Trump really
*  wants or his team going into this wanted it to be the question that defined the whole
*  night, which is.
*  And your opponent on the stage here tonight often asks his supporters, are you better
*  off than you were four years ago?
*  Would you say that voters are better off now than they were four years ago?
*  When it comes to the economy, do you believe Americans are better off than they were four
*  years ago?
*  So I was raised as a middle class kid.
*  Kamala Harris, she starts out, her voice is sort of a little jittery.
*  She sounds nervous.
*  We know that we have a shortage of homes and housing and the cost of housing is too expensive
*  for too many people.
*  And she basically avoids the question.
*  My passion, one of them is small businesses.
*  I was actually my mother raised my sister and me, but there was a woman who helped raise
*  us.
*  We call her our second mother.
*  She was a small business owner.
*  I love our small businesses.
*  She starts with what sounds like a really canned remarks about, you know, I was raised
*  as a middle class kid.
*  I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people.
*  You know, very cliched sort of political rhetoric.
*  And that is why I imagine and have actually a plan to build what I call an opportunity
*  economy.
*  And she starts rattling off some of her policies.
*  My plan is to give a $50,000 tax deduction to start up small businesses, knowing they
*  are part of the backbone of America's economy.
*  And you sort of think, OK, where's she going with this?
*  And then she sort of pivots to this attack against Trump at the end.
*  My opponent, on the other hand, his plan is to do what he has done before, which is to
*  provide a tax cut for billionaires and big corporations.
*  As you know, the guy who's only out for rich people who wants to cut taxes for billionaires.
*  And that's where her first answer ends.
*  Economists have said that that Trump sales tax would actually result for middle class
*  families in about $4,000 more a year because of his policies and his ideas about what
*  should be the backs of middle class people paying for tax cuts for billionaires.
*  I mean, what she's trying to do here is she's trying to present Donald Trump as a guy who's
*  fighting for only himself and his rich friends and contrast herself as someone who grew up
*  middle class, who's fighting for the middle class and who cares about you, the voter.
*  And as you said, this is her objective in this debate to begin to clearly define herself
*  on her own terms.
*  Exactly.
*  Which in this case also means not wanting to talk about whether the economy is better
*  now than it was four years ago.
*  What she's doing is tap dancing.
*  She's tap dancing around it and trying to find an angle to turn this back on offense.
*  And what about Trump's answer on this key issue of the economy?
*  What does he have to say?
*  Trump started out fine.
*  It was a rambling answer, but he basically hit her on the things that we've come to expect
*  him to attack her on.
*  We've had a terrible economy because inflation has, which is really known as a country buster.
*  It breaks up countries.
*  Attacked her on inflation.
*  He defended his tariffs, being tough on China.
*  I took in billions and billions of dollars, as you know, from China.
*  In fact, they never took the tariff off because there was so much money they can't.
*  And then he pivoted to immigration.
*  On top of that, we have millions of people pouring into our country from prisons and
*  jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums.
*  Started attacking her, yes, with hyperbolic claims about criminality and the dangers of
*  undocumented migrants.
*  They are taking over the towns.
*  They're taking over buildings.
*  They're going in violently.
*  And also hyperbolic claims about his own economic record.
*  I created one of the greatest economies in the history of our country.
*  I'll do it again and even better.
*  But it was delivered in a fairly calm manner and exactly the kind of messages that his
*  team has been hoping that he would make.
*  And then we get to the issue of abortion.
*  I want to turn to the issue of abortion.
*  President Trump, you've often touted that you were able to kill Roe v. Wade.
*  This was the first turning point in the debate.
*  Trump gets the first question on abortion.
*  Vice President Harris says that women shouldn't trust you on the issue of abortion because
*  you've changed your position so many times.
*  Therefore, why should they trust you?
*  Well, the reason I'm doing that vote is because the plan is, as you know, the vote is they
*  have abortion in the ninth month.
*  And you can see he's very uncomfortable with it.
*  They even have and you can look at the governor of West Virginia, the previous governor of
*  West Virginia, not the current governor, is doing an excellent job.
*  But the governor before.
*  It's an issue that he's told people privately he thinks could cost him the election.
*  And he starts pivoting around talking about he said the baby will be born and we will
*  decide what to do with the baby.
*  In other words, we'll execute the baby babies being executed after they're born.
*  Then he sort of rolls back around into a states rights argument.
*  Now, Ohio, the vote was somewhat liberal.
*  Kansas, the vote was somewhat liberal, much more liberal than people would have thought.
*  But each individual state is voting.
*  He's kind of all over the place.
*  And then the follow up question goes to Kamala Harris.
*  There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born.
*  Madam Vice President, I want to get your response to President Trump.
*  Donald Trump hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention
*  that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade.
*  And they did exactly as he intended.
*  Now, in over 20 states, there are Trump abortion bans, which make it criminal for a doctor
*  or nurse to provide health care.
*  In one state, it provides prison for life.
*  At this point in the debate, I sort of started to think, OK, she's really finding her footing.
*  You could see the confidence come through in her voice.
*  You want to talk about this is what people wanted?
*  Women who want to carry a pregnancy to term, suffering from a miscarriage, being denied
*  care in an emergency room because the health care providers are afraid they might go to
*  jail and she's bleeding out in a car.
*  And she pretty quickly went to personal stories.
*  She was not talking in an academic way about this issue.
*  A 12 or 13 year old survivor of incest being forced to carry a pregnancy to term.
*  They don't want that.
*  She was emotional in the way she talked about it, talking about a government that would
*  be monitoring your miscarriages.
*  Understand, in his project 2025, there would be a national abortion monitor that would
*  be monitoring your pregnancies, your miscarriages.
*  And she reframed the issue as an issue of freedom.
*  I think the American people believe that certain freedoms, in particular the freedom to make
*  decisions about one's own body, should not be made by the government.
*  Which is another word that the Democrats have been trying to reclaim for themselves
*  from Republicans.
*  Would you veto a national abortion ban if it came to your desk?
*  Well, I won't have to because again, two things.
*  Number one, she said...
*  The other thing that happened here that was really notable is Trump is asked a direct
*  question whether he would veto a national abortion ban if it came to his desk.
*  And the questioner, Lindsey Davis, says, you know...
*  But if I could just get a yes or no, because you're running me, JD Vance has said that
*  you would veto if it did come to your desk.
*  Your running mate, JD Vance, said that you would veto it if it came to your desk.
*  Well, I didn't discuss it with JD, in all fairness.
*  And Trump says, well, wait a second, I didn't discuss it with JD.
*  And I don't mind if he has a certain view, but I think he was speaking for me, but I
*  really didn't.
*  Look, we don't have to discuss it because...
*  So Trump sort of starts wriggling around and suddenly it's Trump that's uncomfortable and
*  the dynamic seems to have shifted.
*  Right, so this is the moment when it feels like Vice President Harris's debate prep has
*  been very extensive and is starting to kind of emerge on the stage.
*  Yeah, and you really see this in the next line of questioning.
*  We're going to turn now to immigration and border security.
*  We know it's an issue that's...
*  Harris is asked a tough question about immigration, which is obviously one of the most unpopular
*  aspects of the Biden and Harris administration.
*  This past June, President Biden imposed tough new asylum restrictions.
*  We know the numbers since then have dropped significantly.
*  But my question to you tonight is why did the administration wait until six months
*  before the election to act?
*  And would you have done anything differently from President Biden on this?
*  So I'm the only person on this stage who has...
*  She does two things very quickly.
*  She goes straight on to offense.
*  She talks about how she's the only person on this stage who's prosecuted transnational
*  criminal organizations.
*  Then she attacks Trump for getting Republicans to kill an immigration bill that would have
*  put more border agents on the border.
*  Donald Trump got on the phone, called up some folks in Congress and said, kill the
*  bill. And you know why?
*  Because he'd prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem and understand.
*  And then she introduces this very interesting line where she talks about Trump's
*  rallies and some of the strange things he mentions at his rallies, like he talks about
*  Hannibal Lecter and windmills causing cancer.
*  And she drops this line, which is just a clear, blatant troll.
*  And what you will also notice is that people start leaving his rallies early out of
*  exhaustion and boredom.
*  She says people start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom.
*  And you can see Trump sort of twitching.
*  Trump is, I've covered him since 2015.
*  He's not exactly a sort of psychologically complicated character.
*  It takes about two minutes of observing him to know that one of the things he cares most
*  about are his crowd sizes.
*  Right. And he just takes the bait.
*  Explain that. He just takes the bait.
*  Well, there's a follow up question that's put to him about why he tried to kill the
*  border bill.
*  First let me respond to the rallies.
*  She said people start leaving.
*  People don't go to her rallies.
*  There's no reason to go.
*  And the first thing he says is, well, let me respond on the rallies.
*  And he says people don't go to her rallies and they like going to my rallies.
*  And we have the biggest and the most incredible.
*  But from that moment on, he starts on this rant.
*  What they have done to our country by allowing these millions and millions of people to
*  come into our country that is infused with anger and irritation.
*  A lot of towns don't want to talk about it because they're so embarrassed by it.
*  And it leads him into undisciplined territory.
*  In Springfield, they're eating the dogs, the people that came in.
*  They're eating the cats.
*  They're eating. They're eating the pets of the people that live there.
*  And this is what's happening in our country.
*  And it's a shame.
*  So in that same answer, he starts talking about how Haitian migrants in Springfield,
*  Ohio, are eating dogs and cats, which is a debunked Facebook rumor that has been flying
*  around right wing circles.
*  And he actually gets fact checked.
*  I just want to clarify here, you rig up Springfield, Ohio, and ABC News did reach out
*  to the city manager there.
*  He told us there had been no credible reports of specific claims of pets being harmed,
*  injured or. And Trump doubles down on it.
*  People on television say my dog was taken and used for food.
*  So maybe he said that.
*  And maybe that's a good thing to say for a city manager.
*  One of the key goals of the Harris team was to get under Trump's skin and to bring out the
*  more unhinged version of himself to remind voters why they voted him out in 2020.
*  And this moment was the first time in the debate where I thought, oh, she's actually
*  succeeding. Right.
*  I mean, and it's worth noting that he's become derailed at a time when he's being offered a
*  chance to talk about one of the strongest issues for him in this campaign, immigration.
*  And in the process, ends up doing the very thing Harris has warned the audience that he
*  does at his rallies, which is make these completely outlandish, unfounded claims about
*  migrants eating domestic pets.
*  It is an extraordinary moment because on an issue where Trump should be dominant, she has
*  managed to get under his skin and he ends up doing great damage to himself.
*  And she sees the moment.
*  Talk about extreme.
*  And she says, talk about extreme.
*  This is perfectly teed up moment for her to say, look how extreme this guy is.
*  And what's clear at this still fairly early point in the debate is that she's gotten under
*  his skin and she's running the debate on her terms.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Jonathan, it really feels like this theme of Kamala Harris trying to and succeeding in
*  getting under Donald Trump's skin really ends up kind of permeating the rest of this
*  debate.
*  Yeah. So they continue on the theme of immigration.
*  Let me continue on immigration.
*  It was what you wanted to talk about earlier.
*  So let's get back to your deportation proposal.
*  And David Muir asks Trump about what he's called the immigration policy.
*  And David Muir asks Trump about what he's called the largest domestic deportation
*  operation in American history.
*  How would you deport 11 million undocumented immigrants?
*  I know you basically asked him how are you going to do this?
*  You know, you say you're going to deport 11 million people.
*  Look like will authorities be going door to door in this country?
*  Yeah, it is much higher because of them.
*  They allowed criminals, many, many millions of criminals and Trump doesn't really ask
*  questions. You know, it's this really huge number of migrants, many, many millions more
*  than anyone thinks.
*  And then he starts talking about how crime is through the roof.
*  And then he gets fact checked again.
*  President Trump, as you know, the FBI says overall violent crime is actually coming down
*  in this country. But excuse me, the FBI defrauded.
*  They were defrauding statements.
*  And Trump gets derailed a little here.
*  He says that the FBI figures are fraudulent.
*  And then Kamala Harris seizes the opportunity.
*  She's clearly prepared for this.
*  Well, I think this is so rich coming from someone who has been prosecuted
*  for national security crimes, economic crimes,
*  election interference has been found liable for sexual assault.
*  And his next big court appearance is in November at his own criminal sentencing.
*  She seizes the opportunity to bring up all of Trump's indictments.
*  Now, this is something that Trump had prepared for in his private sessions.
*  He'd been doing them with some of his aides.
*  Matt Gaetz, the Florida congressman, had been needling Trump, bringing up his criminal
*  convictions, doing exactly what she does here.
*  But you can see, I think, I mean, I don't want to get too much inside Trump's head, but
*  just watching him, he was still so angry about the crowd size
*  comment and everything that had come before.
*  He was basically angry Trump.
*  But those are cases it's called weaponization never happened in this country.
*  They weaponized the Justice Department.
*  And he then says, well, no, this is all a weaponization of justice.
*  Biden and Harris are responsible for every single prosecution against him.
*  Which we should say is factually inaccurate.
*  Right.
*  There's no evidence whatsoever that they've had any involvement in any of the cases.
*  This is the one that weaponized, not me.
*  She weaponized.
*  I probably took a bullet to the head because of the things that they say about me.
*  And he ends this section by basically blaming Biden and Harris for the assassination
*  attempt against him.
*  A pretty extraordinary, completely unsubstantiated claim.
*  Right.
*  And there's no evidence that the shooter was motivated by any Democratic
*  claims that he heard about Donald Trump.
*  And so he's kind of at this point, angry Trump, as you have labeled him, he's
*  kind of lost the plot here in his effort to define her.
*  Yeah.
*  He's lashing out, but nowhere in this section of questioning, has he made a
*  coherent case that she owns the Biden record, that she's irresponsible for inflation.
*  He's getting trapped in all of these little cul-de-sacs that she keeps drawing for him.
*  And the moderators would seem to do Trump a favor in this section of the debate.
*  They ask her about her history of changing positions.
*  Vice President Harris, in your last run for president, you said you wanted to
*  ban fracking.
*  Now you don't.
*  You wanted mandatory government buyback programs for assault weapons.
*  Now your campaign says you don't.
*  And once again, she doesn't really answer the question.
*  I know you say that your values have not changed.
*  So then why have so many of your policy positions changed?
*  So my values have not changed.
*  And I'm going to...
*  Right.
*  Kamala Harris has come up with this very sort of gauzy, cliched answer.
*  My values haven't changed.
*  And at no time has she actually explained why she changed those positions.
*  And instead of really pressing this issue on her, Trump gets caught up in something
*  that she slipped into that answer again to get under his skin.
*  The values I bring to the importance of home ownership, knowing not everybody got
*  handed $400 million on a silver platter and then filed bankruptcy six times.
*  She talks about how Trump was given all this money by his father on a silver platter
*  and, you know, whatever.
*  And of course, that's the thing that Trump opens his answer with.
*  President Trump, your response?
*  Well, first of all, I wasn't given $400 million.
*  I wish I was.
*  My father was a Brooklyn builder, Brooklyn, Queens, and a great father.
*  And I learned a lot from him, but I was given a fraction of that, a tiny fraction.
*  And it takes him four or five sentences to even get to fracking.
*  Even surprised.
*  So we don't have to talk about that.
*  Fracking?
*  She's been against it for 12 years.
*  So again, she's just putting these little nuggets in her answers, which are just
*  designed to trigger Trump and time and time again, it's working.
*  Lindsay, thank you.
*  We have an election in just 56 days and I want to talk about the peaceful transfer
*  of power, which of course this anger from Trump really permeates the rest of the
*  debate. In particular, he gets asked about January 6th.
*  Is there anything you regret about what you did on that day?
*  I had nothing to do with that other than they asked me to make a speech.
*  I showed up for a speech.
*  I said, is pressed on whether he regrets anything about that day.
*  He doesn't say that.
*  It would have never happened if Nancy Pelosi and the mayor of Washington did
*  their jobs.
*  He sort of rewrites the history of January 6th.
*  He then gets caught up on an issue where his aides never want him to talk about.
*  Mr. President, for three and a half years after you lost the 2020 election, you
*  repeatedly falsely claimed that you won, many times saying you won in a landslide.
*  In the past couple of weeks leading up to this debate, you have said, quote, you
*  lost by a whisker.
*  Which is relitigating the results of the 2020 election.
*  Are you now acknowledging that you lost in 2020?
*  No, I don't acknowledge it at all.
*  I said that sarcastically, you know that.
*  It was said, oh, we lost by a whisker.
*  That was said sarcastically.
*  Look, there's so much proof.
*  All you have to do is look at it and they should have sent it back to the
*  legislature's not conceding that he lost.
*  And it culminates in this moment.
*  You talk about a threat to democracy.
*  He got 14 million votes and they threw him out of office where he accuses her of
*  being a threat to democracy by overthrowing Biden.
*  And you know what?
*  I'll give you a little secret.
*  He hates her.
*  He can't stand her.
*  And he makes this wild assertion that Biden hates her.
*  It sort of comes out of nowhere, but it's been building for a while and it sort of
*  reaches a, I guess, a point of absurdity at that moment.
*  Right.
*  And it's here at the peak of Trump's kind of personal fury at Harris that he's
*  given a chance to change this approach.
*  Mr.
*  President, you recently said of vice president Harris, quote, I didn't know she
*  was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black and now
*  she wants to be known as black.
*  The moderators ask him about remarks he has made in the past, which everyone
*  understands to be problematic about her racial identity.
*  I want to ask a bigger picture question here tonight.
*  Why do you believe it's appropriate to weigh in on the racial identity of your
*  opponent?
*  Yeah.
*  So he gets asked this question by David Muir and Trump knows this question's coming.
*  I mean, I was at a press conference with him in Mar-a-Lago a few weeks ago and I
*  asked him this question and he was irritated by it and he knows it's bad
*  politically.
*  So he quickly moved on.
*  And here tonight in the debate, he starts out by sort of brushing it off.
*  I don't care what she is.
*  I don't care.
*  Uh, you make a big deal out of something.
*  I couldn't care less.
*  Whatever she wants to be is okay with me.
*  You're making a big deal about it.
*  I don't care.
*  And then he trips up.
*  Well, I don't know.
*  I mean, all I can say is I read where she was not black that she put out.
*  He falls back into it and he says, I read somewhere she was not black.
*  And then I read that she was black and that's okay.
*  Either one was okay with me.
*  That's up to her.
*  So even in this moment where it's perfectly teed up for him, he just goes
*  back into these self-destructive patterns.
*  Vice President Harris, your thoughts on this?
*  I think it's, I mean, honestly, I think it's a tragedy that we have someone who
*  wants to be president who has consistently over the course of his career
*  attempted to use race to divide the American people.
*  I thought Harris's answer here was really interesting because until
*  tonight when she's asked about this, she has this canned line where she brushes
*  it off, she says, oh, it's just the same tired playbook from Trump.
*  But tonight she actually seized the moment to make another point, a different point,
*  which was it's a tragedy that he's tried to use race to divide the American people.
*  He was investigated because he refused to rent property to black families.
*  And she brought up the DOJ case against the Trump business for refusing
*  to rent property to black families.
*  She brings up his full page ad.
*  In the New York Times calling for the execution of the five young black and
*  Latino boys who were innocent, the Central Park Five.
*  This is the same individual who spread birther lies about the first black
*  president of the United States.
*  She brings up the birther claims about Barack Obama and she kind of closes with this idea.
*  We don't want a leader who is constantly trying to have Americans
*  point their fingers at each other.
*  A very sort of Barack Obama type message about we all have the same dreams and
*  aspirations and tries to present herself as the unifier there.
*  So what are you thinking at this point?
*  Well, I was sort of thinking that at this point she sort of pulled off a coup,
*  which is that she's avoided basically answering any substantive questions about
*  her own policy backflips, about her association with Biden, about, you know,
*  their economic record.
*  She's gone on offense on every issue and she's managed to catch Trump in a trap on
*  pretty much every question, pretty much every response.
*  She's embedded something in there, a sentence or a line that has unraveled
*  Trump and got him on an angry tear.
*  And so you get to basically the end of the debate.
*  I built one of the greatest economies in the history of the world and I'm going to
*  build it again.
*  And you see Donald Trump sort of remember why he was there in the first place.
*  But they're destroying our economy.
*  They have no idea what a good economy is.
*  Which is, oh, whoops.
*  I have to actually remind people that this is Kamala Harris's administration too.
*  And remember this, she is Biden.
*  You know, she's trying to get away from Biden.
*  I don't know the gentleman.
*  She says, she is Biden.
*  You know, so he makes this last ditch effort where he says, she is Biden.
*  She is Biden.
*  He repeats it.
*  Right.
*  And, you know, at this last moment remembers to tie her to Joe Biden and all these
*  other parts of the Biden administration that are unpopular.
*  But at this point, it's kind of late in the game for Trump to figure out what, as
*  you said, he was originally supposed to be up to from the start.
*  It is.
*  The worst president, the worst vice president in the history of our country.
*  President Trump, thank you.
*  And that is our ABC News presidential debate from here in Philadelphia, the
*  National Constitution Center.
*  I'm Lindsay Davis.
*  And I'm David Muir.
*  Thank you for watching here in the U S and all over the world and from all of
*  us here at ABC News.
*  Good night.
*  And, you know, when you look at the debate overall, he was fine for the first 15
*  minutes.
*  He was angry and unraveling for let's call it the middle 40, at least.
*  And then sort of got his footing back at the end.
*  I think there'll be a lot of analysis saying how catastrophic it was.
*  Really?
*  That word you think will be used?
*  I think you were already seeing a lot of commentary to that effect.
*  I don't see it quite like that.
*  I see it as basically a huge missed opportunity for Trump.
*  This was Trump's chance to define Kamala Harris.
*  Might be his only chance, by the way.
*  We still don't know if the Harris and Trump teams will agree on the
*  terms of another debate.
*  So it was a huge missed opportunity for Donald Trump and even Trump allies
*  privately, I don't think this, I know this, will acknowledge that she passed
*  that minimum test that she needed to present herself as a plausible president.
*  And he missed the opportunity to define her as a radical leftist, as someone who
*  owns every bit of the Biden record that you don't like.
*  Hmm.
*  I guess this explains why you so crisply assessed this very early on as a debate
*  where she achieved her goal and he not so much.
*  I spent so much time talking to particularly the Trump people before the
*  debate, I knew how they thought about this debate and I could tell within
*  probably half an hour that this was not going how they wanted it to go.
*  Just think about it from their perspective.
*  There's eight weeks left in this race.
*  It's an absolute toss up of a race and there's a huge number of undecided
*  voters who are up for being shaped about their view of Kamala Harris.
*  They're never going to have potentially another opportunity like this.
*  At best they'll get one more close to the election, but this was their
*  opportunity before a huge audience to define who she is.
*  And he flubbed it.
*  Well Jonathan, thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to nerdy.
*  Moments after Tuesday night's debate, Kamala Harris was endorsed by one of
*  the country's most celebrated and influential pop culture icons, Taylor Swift.
*  Swift called Harris a gifted leader and in a jab at Trump's running, Senator
*  JD Vance signed her endorsement as quote, childless cat lady, a reference to
*  comments made by Vance about women without children and the European
*  Union's highest court has delivered a major defeat to both Apple and Google.
*  It ordered Apple to pay more than $14 billion in assets to the country's
*  $15 billion in unpaid taxes to the government of Ireland and ordered Google
*  to pay a fine of more than $2 billion for giving preferential treatment to
*  its own products over that of its rivals.
*  The rulings were a victory for European governments in a years long campaign to
*  regulate big tech, a battle that American regulators are just beginning to wage.
