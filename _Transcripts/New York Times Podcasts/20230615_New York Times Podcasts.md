*  From The New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tevernici, and this is The Daily.
*  This morning, fierce reaction after the PGA Tour's announcement that it's merging with
*  its Saudi-funded rival, Liv Galfe.
*  The news of this partnership, a shock to players, media and fans hammered out.
*  In a stunning reversal last week, Galfe's premier circuit, the PGA Tour, announced it was
*  partnering with its upstart rival, a controversial league backed by Saudi Arabia.
*  A country that has never won an Olympic gold medal.
*  Saudi Arabia has suddenly emerged as a major player in global sport.
*  Whether it's gobbling up golf rites or signing yet another global soccer star, many
*  roads now seem to lead to re-at.
*  They invested very heavily in golf, Formula One, WWE, they've had boxing there.
*  Now, Saudi Arabia, along with its long record of human rights abuses, has a powerful new
*  seat at the table of international sports, a major success in a year's long effort to
*  win influence.
*  Today, my colleague, Alan Blinder, explains what was behind this surprising turn, what it
*  means for Saudi Arabia, and for the business of sports.
*  It's Thursday, June 15th.
*  So Alan, I have to tell you that a group of producers at the daily were very interested
*  and became in fact quite obsessed with the question of Saudi backed golf.
*  This is the reason why they're so excited.
*  And the team got very excited.
*  And here we are sitting with you doing a podcast about the Saudi backed league, this live
*  league.
*  For those of us who don't know anything about golf like me, explain why this was such
*  a big deal.
*  So until last year, there was an absolutely unquestionably pre-imminent group in golf.
*  It's called the PGA tour.
*  It was where the biggest stars played.
*  They had played there for eons.
*  If you wanted to make it big in pro golf, make money, be a star, you went to the PGA tour,
*  play a lot of tournaments in the US.
*  And then there's this new league that shows up.
*  This live golf operation.
*  It's funded by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund.
*  It showers players with money.
*  And suddenly the PGA tour, for the first time in a long time, maybe even ever, has a real
*  challenger.
*  Now, the PGA tour has essentially been a monopoly for a long time and they weren't going to give
*  it up easily.
*  And then it shocked us last week when they popped up on Tuesday morning and essentially said
*  they were merging.
*  And why does it matter, Alan?
*  Like why does it matter that these two merged?
*  It matters a great deal because Saudi Arabia has spent years trying to establish prestige
*  on the global stage to be a big player around the world, not just in sports, but culturally
*  economically and the like.
*  And look, Saudi Arabia is a country that is oil rich.
*  Its economy is built around oil and natural resources.
*  It's got a human rights record that has been slammed all around the world for almost
*  time in memorial.
*  With good reason, they were responsible for the killing of Jamal Kishogit, the Washington
*  Post-Columnus.
*  Yeah, I mean, there's a long history of human rights abuses that have colored a lot of perceptions
*  of Saudi Arabia.
*  But this merger, I mean, this was essentially unimaginable a year ago.
*  And here we are now with the Saudis poised to have enormous sway over one of the world's
*  biggest sports for years and years to come.
*  Okay.
*  So Saudi Arabia, getting a seat at the table in a big way, how did this deal come together?
*  Where did it all start?
*  Well, a few years ago, the Saudis have the sovereign wealth fund.
*  It's one of the world's largest.
*  They wanted to diversify their economy.
*  They wanted to be about more than oil.
*  So they decide to get into sports as one of their investments.
*  And golf is one of them.
*  Initially, they reach out to the PGA tour.
*  They see is there some kind of alliance to be made, a partnership to be made, and the
*  tour essentially ignores them.
*  Yeah, it did not sit well in Riyadh.
*  It turns out.
*  And why?
*  Why did the PGA tour close the door in their face?
*  Well, they didn't need them.
*  They thought we control the game's highest, mostly elite levels.
*  We've got a gazillion dollars already.
*  It seemed we don't need your help.
*  We've got everything as fine as it is.
*  And that's just kind of the arrogance you sometimes see in professional sports.
*  So the PGA tour essentially rebuffs the Saudis, but they don't give up on this idea that
*  they could play a big role in golf.
*  And it turns out there is a hugely receptive audience to this kind of idea among some of
*  the world's top players.
*  And why are the players so receptive?
*  For decades and decades, there have been arguments in golf about the economic structure,
*  how people get paid, how they make money, how the wealth is spread around.
*  And the PGA tour had been pretty content not to really mess with what was working for
*  them, but that didn't mean the players were happy with it.
*  And there was a lot of discontent bubbling up among the players.
*  There was a lot of nerves, a lot of anger, a lot of frustration.
*  And what was that anger and frustration about?
*  So the traditional way of winning money through professional golf, she played these golf
*  tournaments and really you only make money if you do well.
*  You don't get a baseline salary just for being a member of the PGA tour historically.
*  And you don't even just get a salary for showing up or a payment for showing up.
*  You have to perform well enough to play the full term.
*  Wow.
*  So it's not like baseball or football where you have a contract and you get money just
*  by being part of a team.
*  Yeah.
*  It is essentially pay for performance in professional golf.
*  Now there are guys who would, you know, they make money through some sponsorship deals,
*  equipment deals, that kind of thing.
*  But the PGA tour money, the money that comes from actually playing the sport, was contingent
*  on how well you played.
*  So that meant only a handful of players were making the truly big bucks.
*  There are people who are early career golfers, people who are never going to rise to tiger
*  woods level start them who they don't make much money.
*  Some of them lose money on playing golf.
*  Okay.
*  So this steps the Saudis and what do they do with this discontent?
*  How do they use it?
*  Well, they decide to start their own league, which becomes live golf as we know it now.
*  And they know that in order to take on the establishment, take on the PGA tour, this
*  entrenched monopoly, they've got to get players.
*  There is no way around that.
*  So they think big because they're the Saudis and they have the money to do this.
*  They think big about people like tiger woods and Phil Mickelson and Rory McAurray and Brooks
*  Keppga.
*  They want the biggest names to play the game.
*  Okay.
*  So do they get any of these guys?
*  Well, the rumors start coming fast and furious, all of our professional golf, who might be
*  willing to join, live, who might be willing to leave the PGA tour.
*  And then in February of 2022, it really burst out into the open when Phil Mickelson, who
*  is by all accounts one of the finest golfers ever to play the game, won the Masters Tournament,
*  won the PGA Championship, won the British Open.
*  He's quoted in a new book that was coming out of the time, essentially saying that it
*  didn't matter what the Saudis baggage was.
*  He was interested.
*  Yeah, let me just quote for you directly what Mickelson said to this book author.
*  Their scary mother, then he added a swear word to get involved with it.
*  We know they killed Gashogi and have a horrible record on human rights that execute people
*  over there for being gay.
*  Knowing all of this, why would I even consider this?
*  Because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to reshape how the PGA tour operates.
*  So he's kind of saying this is a very bad regime, but I hate the PGA more.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  And in fact, he really goes on this extended rant about the PGA tour.
*  He's got essentially a greatest hits list of grievances that he's been nursing for a long
*  time.
*  And he talks about how their manipulates him, their coercive.
*  They strung our people.
*  He says, Jayman, a hand of commissioner, you know, is a decent guy, but he won't do what's
*  right for the players in the end.
*  And then he talks about how the Saudi money has given the players the leverage they have
*  always wanted.
*  So Saudi dictators helping golfers get leverage over PGA dictators.
*  That's effectively what he's saying.
*  Yeah, they're pretty much sums it up.
*  So how does the Gulf world react?
*  Well, it was about as ferocious of a reaction as you can imagine.
*  Saudi Gulf league, Bill Mikkelsen, holy cow.
*  He's facing some backlash, losing a big sponsor over his comments he made supporting a Saudi
*  back golf tour.
*  Sponsors are furious.
*  People are condemning Mikkelsen left and right.
*  Several PGA stars, including Rory McElroy blasted Mikkelsen's comments.
*  I thought they were naive, selfish, egotistical, ignorant.
*  You know, watching Papparez there react in Justin Thomas, it's almost like the sort
*  of laughing at Phil as if he sort of lost his mind.
*  You know, he eventually apologizes issues of statement says, I'm going to take some time
*  away, work on myself.
*  He is in essentially full retreat at that moment.
*  So he is like being shamed in the dog house.
*  It is golf's version of being canceled.
*  And a lot of people around golf watch this.
*  They see this guy who's been a reliable, bankable superstar for years and years and years.
*  And they say, if Phil Mikkelsen can't withstand this, if he's getting hit this hard, what happens
*  if I sign up for this new Saudi league?
*  And that leads to the question, can live work?
*  Can they survive?
*  Can they get the players they need?
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Alan, you just told us that everybody's watching this upstart golf league that's going
*  up against the mighty PGA.
*  I mean, this is kind of not a dangerous challenge, right?
*  So what actually happens?
*  Don't give decides to host its first big tournament.
*  And of course, just outside of London.
*  And from really the very earliest stages, it's very clear just how different live is going
*  to be from the PGA tour and the establishment tours.
*  So in traditional golf, you play 72 whole tournaments over four days.
*  Live was using a format that had 54 holes.
*  That's where the live name comes from, the Roman numeral for 54 is LIV.
*  Oh, huh.
*  And it's shorter.
*  It's shorter.
*  I mean, it's a day less of golf.
*  Right.
*  What a relief.
*  Okay, what else?
*  Golf is such a grind that you feel like you're all out there by yourself and sometimes
*  you're not playing well.
*  It can really weigh on you.
*  And usually the focus of a golf tournament is solely on the individual competition.
*  In terms of live golf, you have 12 different teams.
*  Live in its format included the team competition as well.
*  I mean, you guys both played incredible.
*  Your team is awesome.
*  You're the youngest team.
*  What do you have to say to the other team?
*  Even just the vibe of the place is different beyond the game itself.
*  There it is.
*  We promised you an A-Six.
*  Well, a chase, Kecka has to live it.
*  You know, at a traditional golf tournament, you've got players looking really serious.
*  They're in slacks, polo shirts.
*  Oh, and short shot.
*  At a live event, you can see players in shorts.
*  This is up tomorrow.
*  Live tour players will be on the way shorts.
*  The first league and tour to make it official.
*  Trust me, the idea of pro golfers wearing shorts counts as a radical thing.
*  Okay, so when you think of a golf tournament, you likely think of silence when the players
*  are hitting their shots.
*  Noise is not welcome in professional golf.
*  You know, in some terms, they actually hold the signs up to remind people to hush, except
*  the live.
*  Our approach is to treat it like an NBA game or an NHL game or an NFL game, where the
*  entire course is integrated like an arena.
*  One of the slogans was actually, live, it's golf, but louder.
*  Golf but louder.
*  I mean, you had to differentiate yourself.
*  If you were going to go up against the PGA tour, you could not just do the same old same
*  old.
*  It's really different from the buttoned up masters in their khakis.
*  Who's playing?
*  Like who came to play at the tournament?
*  Well, Phil Mickelson resurfaced.
*  I love this game of golf.
*  I've seen the good that it's done.
*  And I see the opportunity for live golf to do a lot of good for the game throughout the
*  world.
*  And I'm excited to be about a part of this opportunity.
*  Oh, wow.
*  So he signed.
*  Yeah, Phil Mickelson signs.
*  I understand that many people have very strong opinions and may disagree with my decision.
*  And it's a big deal because this is the guy who took all the heat and he decided I'm
*  going to play and go forward anyways.
*  At this time, this is an opportunity that gives me a chance to have the most balance in
*  my life going forward.
*  And I think this is going to do a lot of good for the game.
*  So he's in the field.
*  This mother major tournament winners for something that was in its infancy.
*  They drew a pretty good crop of players out there.
*  Okay.
*  So they've pulled off their first event.
*  They've established themselves.
*  What happens next?
*  The thing that they desperately needed was a lot of attention.
*  I mean, they were getting attention for their funding sources.
*  They were getting attention for the politics surrounding it.
*  But they were not really getting a lot of attention for golf.
*  They didn't have a TV deal at the time.
*  If you wanted to watch this thing, you would watch it on YouTube.
*  Oh, wow.
*  So they also need places to play.
*  And a lot of the really great courses in the US were very close to the PGA tour.
*  They wanted nothing to do with live golf.
*  So you start looking at the list of courses in the country that can suit champion chip level
*  golfers.
*  And there aren't many.
*  But you know who had a lot of them with Donald Trump in the Trump organization.
*  Make golf great again.
*  Why former US president and presidential presidential?
*  Hopefully, Donald Trump backs the Saudi funded live golf series.
*  Two live events will be hosted at Trump golf courses, starting with one next weekend at
*  his bed, Mr. New Jersey course.
*  So in July.
*  The live road show rolls into Trump's place in New Jersey.
*  And that, you know, if you don't have a TV deal, then you've at least got a former president
*  wandering around your events.
*  Can you help me appreciate your decision to host this event?
*  Well, I've known these people for a long time in Saudi Arabia.
*  And what they're doing for golf is so great.
*  What they're doing for the players is so great.
*  The salaries are going to go way up.
*  And you know what?
*  The cameras came.
*  The reporters came.
*  It's not too often you see former presidents basically endorsing sports leagues.
*  And you have really the best players in the world.
*  Many of the best players in the world and soon you'll probably have a whole of them.
*  Okay, so throughout all of this, what's PGA doing?
*  Oh, they're absolutely seething.
*  They are furious at the thought that players would ever consider going to this new upstart
*  league.
*  But they also know there's not all that much they can really do about it.
*  Really all the PGA realizes it can do is threaten players.
*  They can say, if you cross the Rubicon, if you go play for live, you can't play PGA
*  tour events going forward.
*  You'll be suspended.
*  But can they even do that?
*  Well, this was always going to end up in a courtroom.
*  And that is exactly where it went.
*  A handful of live players sued the PGA tour.
*  They said that the tour was trampling on their rights, all sorts of questions, but whether
*  the PGA tour was abusing monopoly power and more court filings than I would care to mention.
*  Okay, so the player sue, which on some level makes sense, right?
*  It's like, why do you PGA get to be the final word on golf?
*  You've controlled the game, but the truth is you're this stodgy, old, unchanging thing
*  that isn't really paying us very much.
*  And so we're going to check out this upstart.
*  Yeah.
*  And they look, golfers had the idea that they should be free to pick where they play when
*  they play there.
*  And they thought they should be able to move back and forth between these tours pretty
*  much it will.
*  The PGA tour were one of absolutely none of that.
*  Right.
*  So the PGA tour, they're desperate to keep players because let's face it, having good
*  players is what gets people to come to tournaments.
*  It's what gets people to watch on TV.
*  It is what makes this whole operation work.
*  So the PGA says, okay, we're going to increase our prize money.
*  We're going to start in some instances promising that in your first season you can make a certain
*  amount of money.
*  Like they start trying to throw some bones to people to say, if you're loyal to us, we
*  will make this work for you.
*  The problem is the PGA tour is not made of money.
*  They don't have the bottomless pockets, so to speak, of a Saudi wealth fund.
*  Right.
*  And look, the PGA tour knew this from the start.
*  They have said they could never compete dollar for dollar with a sovereign wealth fund.
*  I mean, take Dustin Johnson, who is this incredible golfer.
*  He had played on the PGA tour for 15 seasons.
*  In that whole 15 season run, he had had 75 million in earnings.
*  He makes the jump over to live.
*  By the end of the first season of live, he had made more than $35 million in prize money.
*  Holy moly, that is money.
*  Yeah, I mean, look, the arms race of money has come to professional golf, and it came with
*  very, very little warning in the grand scheme of things.
*  So the reality is the PGA tour, it starts to feel the financial sting of this.
*  They are suddenly showing out many, many, many millions of dollars more than they had anticipated
*  doing.
*  Okay.
*  So PGA can't keep up with the Saudis and the money department, so that's not on their
*  side.
*  But do they have anything going for them at all?
*  They've got a few things.
*  They've got the argument of history where the PGA tour, we've been around.
*  You know us.
*  You like us.
*  We should tolerate us.
*  We should get that.
*  And then there's also this element the PGA tour keeps using of, look where the money is
*  coming from for live golf, and they really wrap themselves in this cloak of morality and
*  say, you know, our money is pure.
*  It comes from TV deals.
*  It comes from traditional sponsorships.
*  It's American money for the most part.
*  The PGA tour commissioner at one point says, have you ever had to apologize for being
*  a member of the PGA tour?
*  Meaning our red blooded American money has none of that Saudi stain.
*  That's exactly the implication.
*  There are family members of 9-11 victims coming out and questioning how could any golf
*  for sleep at night if he takes money from Saudi Arabia.
*  There are some protests.
*  This whole thing, it goes from just being an economic spat in golf to having these really
*  frayed emotional implications and storylines associated with it.
*  So the PGA tour is howling with moral outrage.
*  But eventually we learn that the two actually started meeting and talking about, could there
*  be a way to work together?
*  So publicly moral outrage, privately, something entirely different.
*  That's what it came to.
*  It all started when a member of the PGA tour's board messaged the governor of the Saudi
*  sovereign wealth fund and said, I'd like to set up a call and hopefully a meeting with
*  you.
*  And then they were off to the races.
*  I'm not sure I can convey just how secretive this deal was until it was announced.
*  You know, there were members of the PGA tour board who did not know about it.
*  Really?
*  Until right before it was announced.
*  This was a handful of people who cut a deal and then told the world, this is the new
*  world order in golf.
*  And the complexity of what we were dealing with, it's not uncommon that the circle of
*  information is very tight.
*  And the PGA tour commissioner who was central to all these negotiations, he suddenly
*  finds himself on defense.
*  And I recognize everything that I've said in the past and in my prior position.
*  He goes and holds this press conference.
*  And he says, I know you're going to think I'm a hypocrite.
*  And anytime I've said anything, I said it with the information I had at that moment.
*  And I said it based on someone that's trying to compete for the PGA tour in our players.
*  They said, I know you're going to think that I just did this dirty deed.
*  I accept those criticisms.
*  But this is what I thought the game needed to survive.
*  I mean, it was very much a business argument.
*  It put us in a position where again, we're in control.
*  We have an investor.
*  And ultimately, you know, for the game, we're moving forward constructively.
*  And if you look at the values of the game, I think that's what the situation warranted.
*  The PGA tour, for the longest time they got to claim this was a battle of morality.
*  This was about the integrity of the game.
*  The Saudi element made them a convenient bokeh man.
*  But they ceded that argument last week.
*  Alan, now that you've taught me all about golf, I'm kind of curious what it means for the
*  game.
*  Like, is it totally changed?
*  What happens to golf?
*  So the wealth funds governor is about to be the chairman of this new company that's been
*  created.
*  And the Saudis essentially hold the purse strings for men's professional golf.
*  You know, at this point, you can't really say it was a complete conquering of golf by
*  the Saudis because the PGA tour still has a big and consequential role.
*  But if I had told you a year ago that we would be at this point now, people would have
*  laughed me out of the room.
*  I mean, the Saudis have long wanted to be seen as not a pariah nation, you know, President
*  Biden had condemned them as a pariah.
*  The PGA tour deal doesn't instantly lift the whole cloud off Saudi Arabia.
*  No sports deal is ever going to do that.
*  But it's a part of a process of being accepted by Western society.
*  It's a form of soft power.
*  That was always the idea behind some of these sports investments we're seeing out of the
*  Persian Gulf.
*  And now the Saudis have a pretty good playbook for how to do this in other sports if they
*  want to.
*  They saw flaws in an economic model that were apparent for all to see.
*  And they capitalized on it.
*  It took advantage of them.
*  And that could be a recipe for trouble for other sports around the world.
*  Like upstart with deep pockets, disrupts, establish monopolistic power that took for granted
*  its position for a very long time.
*  Yeah, I mean, just like you would see a startup in Silicon Valley challenging an entrenched
*  player, we see how it can happen in sports.
*  We see how you can do it with billions of dollars from a sovereign wealth fund.
*  And if you're a sports executive, you're thinking, how do I make sure that I can't be caught
*  asleep at the wheel because in a lot of ways, it's what the PGA tour was.
*  The PGA tour thought it was invincible.
*  What we have now learned is that it only takes year or so of really public badgering and
*  a whole lot of money.
*  And then the PGA tour is no longer invincible.
*  Alan, thank you.
*  My pleasure.
*  Today, the PGA tour will begin their first major tournament since the deal was announced.
*  This year's US Open.
*  It follows a sudden announcement by the PGA tour that its commissioner, J. Monahan,
*  was, quote, recouporating from a medical situation and that he would temporarily step
*  aside.
*  It did not give a timeline for his return.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should note today.
*  On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, the first pause after raising
*  them 10 times in a row over many months.
*  Fed officials said they were pausing to assess how the economy is reacting to the rapid
*  campaign to slow demand and to control inflation.
*  But Fed officials remain concerned about inflation, indicating on Wednesday that they may make
*  two more rate increases this year.
*  And Southern Baptists, the largest Protestant denomination in the country that is often seen
*  as a bellweather for American evangelicalism, finalized the expulsion of two churches led
*  by female pastors at a Daniel convention.
*  The move may explicit a ban on women in leadership and marked a win for the ultra conservative
*  wing of the denomination, which is fighting against what it sees as liberal drift.
