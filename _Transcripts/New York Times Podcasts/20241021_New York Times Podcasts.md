# What Happens in Vegas Could Decide the Election
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv6hPQgKMsU)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  For millions of Americans, the housing crisis defines the U.S. economy.
*  In the swing state of Nevada, it could soon define the election.
*  My colleagues, politics reporter Jenny Medina and Daily producers Carlos Prieto and Claire
*  Tennesgetter traveled there to understand what happens when the promise of the American
*  dream slips away.
*  It's Monday, October 21st.
*  So we are at the point in the election where there are so few days left that we're literally
*  counting them down.
*  And as we do that, we are closing in here on the show on the issues that really seem
*  to be driving and defining the election in the key swing states that will ultimately
*  determine whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris wins the White House.
*  And Jenny, you have been reporting out of Nevada.
*  So just to begin with, put that state into the broader electoral picture for us.
*  So we're in a coin flip election nationally, and Nevada really is a coin flip state.
*  At this point, either party could win by just the slimmest of margins.
*  And that's interesting because Democrats have really counted on Nevada for their wins for
*  the last 20 years.
*  The last Republican to win was George Bush in 2004.
*  And when Obama won in 2008, Nevada was a major victory for Democrats.
*  And has remained ever since.
*  Basically, Democrats have never lost it since 2004.
*  Right.
*  And a lot of Democrats thought that that heralded this future for them, that they were the party
*  of diversity, that they were the party of the working class.
*  And in a lot of ways, no state epitomized that more than Nevada, where the overwhelming
*  majority of voters do not have a college degree.
*  There's a very large Hispanic population, and there's also a really significant Asian
*  and black population.
*  And so for Democrats, it's a state that matters not only for its six electoral votes, but
*  maybe even more so for its symbolism.
*  And it's also a place that Democrats worry about every single cycle, because they keep
*  eking out these wins, but by an increasingly shrinking margin.
*  Okay.
*  And what does Nevada mean to Republicans in this moment?
*  Well, I think for Republicans, it's a lot of the same thing.
*  There is this symbolism that it represents for them.
*  Trump has spent a lot of time in Nevada, both this year and in the 2020 cycle.
*  And he has a lot of devotees there.
*  And there's also this idea that's been percolating, and we've seen for four years now, of Trump
*  making inroads with working class voters who are not white.
*  Trump did well with many of these voters in 2020 and might do even better this time around.
*  And so for Trump, if he wins this prize of Nevada, he'll be able to say, look, I am helping
*  us become the party of the working class.
*  I am helping us become a more diverse party.
*  You all criticize me for these things that I say and accuse me of being racist, but I'm
*  actually getting more of these voters who you thought were never possible.
*  And based on the time that you've spent there, what is the animating issue for voters in
*  Nevada this year?
*  Without question, the animating issue is the economy.
*  This is a place that has always had a lot of boom and bust cycles, but COVID completely
*  obliterated the Las Vegas economy.
*  It really hurt a lot of people, and we're still seeing the effects of that.
*  And when we talk about the economy now, what voters say first is housing, just how much
*  it costs to live there.
*  Right.
*  That doesn't necessarily surprise me because we've talked so much on the show about the
*  nationwide housing crunch.
*  And put simply, it's that there is not enough housing and the housing that exists is too
*  expensive.
*  What exactly is the picture of the housing problem in Vegas?
*  I tend to think of it as a place actually with a tremendous amount of housing.
*  Right.
*  Traditionally, Vegas has been exactly that.
*  The thing to know about Las Vegas is that it was this sprawling place where people flock
*  to for their little slice of the American dream.
*  It's really an exciting time for all of us here in the valley because of all those new
*  developments, especially for home buyers.
*  You can even see what this...
*  It was a big expanse of desert.
*  There were always new houses being built.
*  Clark County coming in at number two on the list of the hottest zip codes across the country.
*  And people could afford those houses without having a huge salary.
*  As long as you get on the right websites and you find the right postings, you can find
*  housing pretty much within a week.
*  But during and after the pandemic, that really started to shift.
*  A home buying frenzy happening now in Las Vegas.
*  Local viewers will say the pandemic has dramatically changed the local housing market.
*  You had a lot of people moving in to Las Vegas.
*  It's a gorgeous area.
*  Everybody seems nice.
*  And it's a lot cheaper to live here than California.
*  150,000 people moved to Nevada from California alone.
*  Fascinating.
*  Housing prices in Las Vegas continue to skyrocket.
*  So you had rents going up, interest rates going up, and all of the sudden, this place
*  that was once affordable started to feel just like California, like the very places people
*  were trying to leave.
*  And just how expensive does housing become in the state?
*  So when we're talking about the state, what we're really focusing on is Clark County,
*  Vegas and all the surrounding suburbs.
*  70% of the population of Nevada lives in Clark County.
*  We're just trying to talk to people about their business and the economy in Las Vegas.
*  Do you mind if we ask you a couple questions?
*  I've spent a lot of time over the last year talking with voters in Clark County.
*  And a couple of weeks ago, I went back with daily producers, Carlos Prieto and Claire
*  Tennesquaddo to hear from voters about what the housing crisis has looked like.
*  Do you mind if we ask you a couple questions?
*  And what did you find?
*  Two-bedroom, it is $1,200 a month.
*  So just last year, I was paying $700.
*  Basically, everybody that you talk with will tell you a story about how much their rent
*  has increased.
*  $900.
*  Wow.
*  It's gone up a lot after the pandemic.
*  And they'll explain that compared to what they were paying in 2019 or even 2021, their
*  rent has effectively doubled or even tripled today.
*  Do you remember what your rent, what they wanted to increase it to?
*  Almost three grand, I think.
*  It had been around $1,300.
*  Remember five years ago, you could rent a house, a house for $725.
*  And now for $1,200, all you can get is a studio.
*  People talk about signing six-month leases and watching their rent go up at least $100
*  every six months.
*  So how much of your income goes to rent specifically?
*  Basically, all of it.
*  Literally all of it.
*  People talk about looking for houses for months or even years on end and not being able to
*  afford the down payment.
*  Everybody has that story of housing woe.
*  Actually, when I got over here, I was very young.
*  So I was able to work hard with my ex-husband and buy a house.
*  And now it's like, you can't do that.
*  So we ended up visiting somebody who really typifies what a lot of people are going through
*  in Las Vegas, who feels like that dream of Las Vegas has not materialized for him.
*  It has not been a bridge to the middle class.
*  Hi.
*  Hello.
*  Hi.
*  Armando?
*  Yes.
*  How are you?
*  Jenny.
*  Nice to meet you.
*  How are you?
*  I'm good.
*  Thank you so much.
*  His name is Armando Garcia.
*  He's 26 years old.
*  And we met him at the rental home he shares with his partner, two roommates and a few
*  pets.
*  We sat down in his living room, which is a very simple space.
*  There's not a lot of decorations or furniture around.
*  There's just a Dungeons and Dragons game on the coffee table.
*  And remind me again, I know you told me, but I can't recall.
*  How much do you pay for rent here total?
*  The base rent is $2,000.
*  And then water and trash can fluctuate from like $200 to $400.
*  And then electricity and gas, we pay separately from our rent.
*  And that fluctuates even more.
*  And tell me a little bit about how hard it is or isn't to make rent.
*  It's been difficult.
*  Currently at my job, I work $20 an hour plus commission.
*  And my other roommates also work like $16 an hour to $20 an hour.
*  One of them works salary.
*  And we're still like struggling to keep up with our rent.
*  And he started telling us about his life and this difficult housing saga.
*  He's been going through.
*  My dad's from Acapulco.
*  And my mom's from Mexico.
*  Armando's parents are both from Mexico.
*  They moved to San Diego, where he was born.
*  My family moved to Las Vegas in the summer of 2005.
*  My uncle was opening up a sandwich shop and he wanted my dad to help with the business.
*  So we moved here.
*  And when they first got there, Armando remembers it being a lot more difficult than his parents
*  had hoped or expected it would be.
*  My dad was working as a cook.
*  And then I remember my parents started cleaning things at night.
*  They worked multiple jobs.
*  And they were also constantly struggling to figure out how to pay the rent.
*  But they kept encouraging him to try to do what they couldn't.
*  And my parents were like, you should try to buy a house.
*  They kept saying, even from the time he was a teenager, Armando, buy a home, buy a home.
*  You can do it.
*  Buy a home.
*  And then eventually I moved out.
*  And then he decides to move out of his parents' house and in with roommates.
*  And then I started working at the call center, which was $16 an hour.
*  He has what he describes as a pretty decent paying job.
*  And he feels like it's pretty stable.
*  I had the ability to make a savings.
*  And he thinks he might be able to put enough money away to actually be able to do what
*  his parents keep encouraging him to do, to buy a home.
*  But then the pandemic comes and he shuffles through a couple of jobs.
*  And at the same time, his rent keeps going up higher and higher each month.
*  And the bills feel further and further out of reach.
*  And then I had to like use my credit cards more so that I would have cash.
*  So he's living paycheck to paycheck and racking up debt.
*  So I got to the point where I was just like, I'm not paying my credit cards.
*  I'm just keeping the money that I have to pay for food and rent.
*  And this keeps going on for a while.
*  Eventually he and his roommates move from the apartment to a house to save a little
*  bit of money, but he's still barely making ends meet.
*  And then earlier this year, things change really quickly and a lot starts to unravel.
*  We three of us had lost our jobs and we all had to find jobs within like two weeks.
*  He loses a job and is without a paycheck for two weeks.
*  And for him and for his roommates, that's really catastrophic.
*  They fell behind on rent very quickly.
*  Their landlord took them to eviction court.
*  They come back with an eviction order.
*  And so then we kind of just had like a week.
*  And they're all really preparing to have to leave the home.
*  So he put everything in storage.
*  And it's really scary for them.
*  He tried to comfort one of his roommates who was just really freaked out and kind of panicking,
*  thinking that she might be either couch surfing or living in her car.
*  I remember like every day for two weeks, I had to like hold her while she cried.
*  She could not imagine what a future would look like where we were homeless.
*  And it ended up being where I had to borrow a thousand dollars from my mom,
*  a thousand dollars from my uncle to make three months of rent.
*  So they barely escape eviction.
*  And really the only way they manage to do so is because Armando cobbles together
*  some small loans from two different family members.
*  But Armando is really shaken.
*  He's gone from thinking a few years ago that it was possible for him to buy a house
*  to now realizing that he's in just as a precarious position
*  or an even more precarious position than his parents were ever in.
*  And to the degree that the American dream has always been grounded in this idea that
*  you will do better than your parents, this has to be exceptionally disillusioning.
*  Yes. And that dream that he had inherited from his parents of buying a house has completely vanished.
*  Do you want to move out to your own place with your partner at some point? Is that a dream?
*  It'd be nice.
*  But I think the dream of having my own home is not a dream I've had since I was 21.
*  Why not?
*  Because I think it just feels too bold to have that dream.
*  I could dream and in the dream hypothetically like we're stable enough to own it.
*  But like what always kind of like dampens the daydream is that to me now it just feels unrealistic.
*  It doesn't feel like I can like daydream about it for very long because it just
*  feels like I have realism around me all the time.
*  And in a lot of ways his story might sound extreme, but it's really not that unique.
*  We spoke to a local real estate agent in Vegas who grew up there and had seen all of this up
*  close. And he said that for most people who work in Las Vegas without a college degree,
*  what used to be attainable, what used to be very possible, no longer is.
*  You just can't get what your parents might have been able to get 10 or 20 years ago.
*  This is what is infuriating many people who live in Las Vegas and have lived here for years.
*  There are people all over Las Vegas and other parts of the country who are really struggling
*  with this basic idea of making rent or finding a place to live for good.
*  Even parents who I speak with who own a home worry constantly that their kids won't have a place to
*  live. It's a really basic thing that we often take for granted, but that many people are now
*  struggling with more than before. And so for those people, they're looking at this presidential
*  election through the lens of a housing crisis. They're not worried about anything else to the
*  degree that they are worried about finding a place to live comfortably and stably.
*  And so what they want to know is how can you address this? Are you going to do anything to
*  change my basic experience of living in America? Can you possibly restore my faith in the American
*  dream even? Because I think when you don't have a stable place to live, it really shatters your
*  faith in that. It really makes you question what the government is doing and what kind of safety
*  and stability there is in this country. And that's a real challenge that Donald Trump and
*  Kamala Harris face in making their case to voters right now. They're trying to navigate
*  this level of frustration and distrust in two very different ways.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Jenny, given the dynamics that you just outlined, how has the presidential race,
*  the campaign, played out in Nevada?
*  So there is absolutely no ignoring the presidential campaign in Nevada.
*  Their Bidenomics led to the highest inflation in 40 years.
*  Everywhere you go, any restaurant you're in where there is a TV on,
*  you see an ad from one candidate or another.
*  Kamala's for they them. President Trump is for you.
*  There are billboards everywhere, every radio station.
*  We need Kamala Harris.
*  You're going to be fed some sort of political app.
*  I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message.
*  And the candidates have come in and out of the state multiple times.
*  Hello, Las Vegas. Hello, Las Vegas.
*  And every single time they come, they're there to talk about the economy.
*  We had the greatest economy in history.
*  And for Donald Trump, he has really hammered home the message that this is Democrats' fault.
*  People are saying to themselves, were we better off four years ago or are we better off now?
*  And it wasn't even close.
*  Any economic pain that you are feeling is because something that Democrats did or did not do.
*  We also need to build more housing in America.
*  And Harris, for her part, has been a little bit more specific.
*  So we will cut the red tape and work with the private sector to build three million new homes.
*  She has gone out there and given speeches a couple of times talking about
*  how much more housing needs to be built.
*  Provide first-time home buyers with $25,000 down payment assistance.
*  About tax credits and more specific ideas of how she can try to help change the situation.
*  So Harris is more explicitly talking about housing in a state where, based on your reporting,
*  housing is the driving issue.
*  Is that disparity in the two candidates' focus on housing mattering?
*  And how are voters generally responding to these two competing messages?
*  So, of course, like in every other state, there are people who are just viewing this in the same
*  way they always have.
*  In a partisan lens, there are the people who voted for Trump and will stick with him again.
*  There are people who voted for Biden and are sticking with Harris.
*  But there's a small group of people who are not really tuning into this until right now,
*  who are undecided, and they are the people who will matter the most on election day.
*  Right, the coveted, persuadable voter.
*  Absolutely.
*  The persuadable voter.
*  And in Las Vegas, that typically means a non-college educated voter,
*  most likely Black or Latino, and most likely living paycheck to paycheck.
*  And after talking to dozens of these voters in the last several weeks,
*  I think about them as in three different buckets.
*  And what are those buckets?
*  The first group of those voters are people who describe themselves as progressives,
*  who have been longtime committed Democrats, but now feel like the party has abandoned them
*  and are considering voting for some kind of third-party candidate by writing somebody in.
*  And I think Armando, who couldn't afford his rent anymore,
*  he describes himself in just that way.
*  Are you voting in this year's election?
*  I am.
*  Can I ask you about who you plan to vote for and why?
*  It's difficult. I'd like to vote for the Green Party.
*  Armando says there's a tiny chance he might change his mind and vote for Harris.
*  Like a 2% chance.
*  But if the election were today, he would write in Jill Stein or somebody else and take a very
*  ideologically committed vote and sort of hope for some kind of political revolution, so to speak.
*  These are voters who it seems are ready to cast a protest vote against the entire system,
*  Democratic and Republican.
*  And that's not really that surprising in Nevada. Remember, this is where Bernie Sanders won
*  in the 2020 Democratic caucus, but it's also the smallest group of these voters.
*  What is the second group?
*  The second group is what you might think of as Trump-Turners.
*  These are mostly people who voted for Obama in the past,
*  but felt like his promises of hope and change and the Democratic promise of hope and change
*  has basically been empty for them.
*  There's a lot of this sense of what we face now is worse, we are worse off,
*  we're going in the wrong direction.
*  And maybe we should just go back to what we had under the Trump administration.
*  Do you mind if I ask you a couple questions?
*  That's okay, but I just speak too much English.
*  It's fine if you want to tell me, answer me in Spanish, that's fine too.
*  For example, we met a woman named Kenya who was selling herbal supplements.
*  And she voted for Joe Biden in 2020, but she's seen her family struggle financially.
*  She says a lot of her family members have been looking for a home for a while
*  and just can't afford to buy one.
*  And she thinks, look, maybe Trump is the better businessman
*  who can make her bottom line feel better.
*  Then we went to a baseball field where I had been just a month before
*  and at that time had spoken to a lot of voters who were undecided.
*  But this time I was surprised by how many people there
*  were very enthusiastically voting for Trump.
*  What do you all like about him?
*  What do you see?
*  He's a businessman.
*  You get to run a country like a business.
*  So who are you voting for in the fall?
*  Probably Trump.
*  I'm voting for Trump.
*  Everybody hates me when I say this, but I would personally vote for Trump.
*  Yeah.
*  Can I ask you who you're voting for?
*  Trump.
*  You're voting for Trump?
*  Yes.
*  Okay.
*  I prefer Trump over what we have.
*  Okay.
*  Basically, they want change.
*  And in Trump's message of a broken system that he says he will repair,
*  sounds like they're finding that change.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  And Jenny, what's the third group of these persuadable voters?
*  So the third group of voters are kind of the most interesting to me.
*  Maria, can I ask you a little bit about politics?
*  Will you vote in November?
*  I won't this time.
*  I didn't plan on voting.
*  Really, to be honest with you.
*  I don't think I will vote.
*  You don't think you will vote?
*  No.
*  And those are people who have voted in the past or who at least think about voting.
*  I'm tired of it all.
*  You know, I'm just burnt out.
*  But say this time they are just not going to vote at all.
*  I am a Democrat.
*  Same garbage, different package.
*  Democrats and Republicans, they don't do nothing no more for us.
*  We met those people at a swap meet.
*  We met them at grocery stores.
*  I feel like no matter who we vote for, they're going to choose who they want to choose.
*  To be honest, that's just how I feel.
*  And I've met them again and again over months going to Nevada.
*  I used to promise things I would say.
*  It's not that I expect to fix the world in one night or one day, but it's like I don't see anything.
*  I don't see nothing coming out for us.
*  These are people who have voted for Democrats in the past but feel like the system just isn't
*  working and just don't see the point anymore.
*  Just don't feel like there's any reason to do what they've done in the past and sitting out
*  as their form of protest.
*  A different form of protest than Armando, for example.
*  Right. A different form of protest.
*  They just feel frustrated and want to voice this frustration.
*  Is it fair to say that you're not voting because you're angry?
*  No, I'm not angry.
*  I'm disappointed.
*  I'm disappointed.
*  Yeah.
*  Angry?
*  No.
*  I mean, Jenny, what you're really describing here in all of these encounters you had with
*  voters in Nevada is a profound cynicism, right?
*  It feels deeply connected to their eroding economic circumstances, primarily housing,
*  but it sounds like not just housing.
*  By and large, what you're finding would seem to generally cut against the Democrats.
*  Yes, absolutely.
*  I think what I have found over the last several months in Nevada over this entire year
*  is just a really profound sense of cynicism that is essentially defining the electorate there.
*  There is so much anger over the economy and so much a feeling of broken promises.
*  People feel very, very frustrated and very, very hopeless, and it hurts people's day-to-day lives.
*  What they thought Vegas was supposed to mean for them, what Vegas meant to their
*  families, what Vegas meant for the possibilities, all seems to have evaporated,
*  and they lay that fairly or not at the feet of Democrats.
*  There's a case to be made that rather than this being a Biden-Harris Democratic Party
*  problem just based on the fact that they are the incumbent administration, that this cynicism
*  is something that Democrats are struggling with and have been struggling with for a really long time
*  because the Democratic Party does see itself as the party of institutional solutions,
*  going all the way back to the New Deal, up through Obamacare.
*  If you are a cynical voter inclined to distrust the government as the vehicle for solving your
*  problem, then the Democratic brand is one you're very likely to be wary of.
*  It's a whole lot easier to run against the system.
*  Who has better mounted a campaign against the system than Donald Trump?
*  I think it's important to remember that many of these voters once believed in that system.
*  They really believed that government, in fact, they might still believe that government was
*  supposed to have a positive impact in their lives, but they don't feel like it has.
*  That's the promise that they feel is broken. That's what's leading them to their cynicism.
*  You say that government is supposed to work for me and I don't actually see that coming true.
*  You say that government is supposed to improve my life and my children's life
*  and in fact, I feel like my children are going to be worse off than I am.
*  That sort of overwhelming feeling of things aren't going to get better,
*  things aren't getting better. And this sort of feeling of giving up,
*  of thinking I keep trying and trying and it's not getting better.
*  So what do I have to lose by just blowing up the system?
*  And in Nevada, working class voters, voters without a college degree and Latino voters
*  are some of the fastest growing segments of voters overall.
*  And if those voters have become so cynical that they decide to blow up the system,
*  it could mean that Trump wins the state.
*  And that's completely emblematic of what we see going on nationally.
*  Of Latino voters voicing frustration over the Democratic Party,
*  of working class voters voicing frustration over the Democratic Party,
*  of this feeling that the American dream might be out of reach
*  for people that once really had a possibility.
*  And if that cynicism becomes a defining feature of this year's election,
*  it will be a big part of what could hand the White House to Donald Trump.
*  Well, Jenny, thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to another day.
*  Over the weekend, any hope that the death of Hamas's leader
*  might help end the region's war quickly evaporated.
*  In Israel, a drone from Lebanon crashed near the private residence of Israel's Prime Minister
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, raising the possibility that Hezbollah sought to target him.
*  In Lebanon, Israel claimed its airstrikes had killed three Hezbollah commanders.
*  And in Gaza, Palestinian authorities said that a major Israeli airstrike
*  had killed or wounded dozens of people.
*  And North Carolina has become the second battleground state
*  to set a record on the first day of early voting.
*  Residents of the state cast more than 350,000 ballots on Thursday
*  and another 150,000 on Friday.
*  Earlier last week, first day voting records were also shattered in Georgia.
