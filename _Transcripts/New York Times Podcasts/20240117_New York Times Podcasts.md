*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tevernice and this is The Daily.
*  Many American colleges have stopped requiring standardized tests like the SATs on the theory
*  that they heard diversity, but new research suggests that colleges may have made a mistake.
*  Today, my colleague David Leighenhart on the War on the SATs and why colleges are still reluctant to bring them back.
*  It's Wednesday, January 17th.
*  So David, ever since the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions,
*  it's opened up this larger conversation around the college admissions process, you know,
*  what's fair and what tools do we have to create diverse student bodies now?
*  And recently, you've been reporting on the SATs in this context. Tell us why you decided to focus
*  on the SATs in particular. There's been a radical change with standardized tests in this country,
*  both the SATs and the ACTs, which many students also take when applying to college.
*  And for years, people have not liked the SAT. I mean, I'm sure you remember taking it Sabrina.
*  It's not fun to take. Who likes the SAT? Yeah, I mean, I can still remember the dark jam I went
*  and sat in, anxiously, 35 years ago. And on top of the inherent unpleasantness of standardized tests,
*  I think a lot of people, particularly on the political left, have worried that standardized tests
*  are an enemy of diversity. And so there's been this criticism bubbling up and then comes COVID.
*  And during the pandemic, it was basically impossible for teenagers to go out and take these standardized tests.
*  And so one college after another announced, you no longer have to take the SAT or ACT to apply here.
*  They went test optional as they called it. And is this most colleges? Yes, nearly all colleges.
*  And when the college is announced, if they said this is a temporary move,
*  but almost all colleges have remained test optional. So that's a really big change in college
*  admissions. Right. And I got interested in that change to understand what has it meant that
*  colleges have moved away from these standardized tests that they required for decades.
*  It also turns out that there's been some new research looking at what is the use of the SAT?
*  What does it tell you about applicants? And in part, because of that new research, and in part
*  because of the experiences that colleges have had with an admission system that doesn't include
*  standardized tests, there are now a bunch of people in higher education who are saying, we made a
*  mistake and we should bring back our test requirements. Okay, so let's talk about the case to bring it back.
*  Now you were actually on the show last summer and you talked about some of this new research,
*  remind us briefly of those findings, David, and tell us where the SATs come into them.
*  So this in-depth study looking at college admissions that was released last summer ended up
*  finding that the richest applicants have huge advantages in college admissions. And a lot of
*  people have assumed that the SAT must be one of the advantages that richer applicants have.
*  Because think about it, if you're rich, you can take test prep classes. Right. You can take the SAT
*  multiple times. You also might go to a private school or a top public school that's going to prepare
*  you better for the test. There are all kinds of ways in which you might have an advantage on the SAT
*  because of wealth. But it turns out that many of the other aspects of the admissions process
*  are more tilted toward the rich than standardized tests. Think about extracurricular activities.
*  Who can pay to take music lessons? Who can pay to travel to foreign countries and participate in
*  the projects that expand their horizons? Right. Cures for cancer in a summer project. Exactly.
*  Who can pay to participate on travel sports teams? And it's not just extracurriculars. Think
*  about all of the editing that highly educated affluent parents do of their children's colleges.
*  Think about the quality of a school recommendation that you're going to get if you go to a private
*  school, as opposed to a public school where the guidance counselor has 500 students who they're
*  advised. Right. And so actually standardized tests, a single test that everybody must take the same
*  test. End up being less tilted toward the wealthy than many other aspects of the process like
*  extracurriculars and essay writing and school recommendations. So let's pause and unpack that a little
*  bit, David, because I think it'll be surprising for listeners. I mean, SATs, you think test prep,
*  you think advantage parents pouring money, pouring time, pouring effort into this test prep,
*  doesn't that confer advantage on the wealthy? Well, first, I should make clear, there are gaps
*  along racial and economic lines in average SAT scores. Upper income students do better on average
*  than lower income students. White and Asian students do better on average than black and Latino
*  students. And this is probably the main point that the critics of the test make. They say,
*  look at these gaps. The test must be biased. But let's start with test prep. The evidence
*  suggests that test prep actually causes only a tiny part of these gaps, maybe not that different
*  from zero. And the way to see that is to look at other tests that millions of students across
*  the country take, but don't take test prep for it. And maybe the best known one is called the
*  NAPE. Its nickname is the nation's report card. It's a test nationwide that elementary school
*  students and middle school students take. There's a good chance that you or your students have taken
*  the NAPE in your state, but that they called it something other than the NAPE locally. Okay.
*  And so no one takes NAPE test prep because for an individual student, the NAPE doesn't really
*  matter. It's instead used to see which school districts are doing well, which states are doing well.
*  It's a tool for states in local school district to see how they're doing.
*  That's exactly right. When you see headlines once a year come out about how much fourth graders
*  or eighth graders have learned in the United States, that comes from the NAPE. And what's really
*  striking is that the economic gaps that is between how richer and poorer students do and the racial
*  gaps are incredibly similar on the NAPE as they are to the SAT. And so that is another way of saying
*  test prep just isn't that big a deal. Okay. So there are these gaps in both the SATs and the NAPE's
*  these other important national tests. And their gaps, as you said, along economic and racial lines.
*  So if it isn't test prep that's actually driving the gaps, then I guess the question is what is?
*  And I'm thinking it has something to do with inequality in America. Yes. The tests are picking up
*  real inequities in American life. Think about it. We live in a society with enormous economic
*  and racial inequality. You see this in nearly every measure of American life, home ownership,
*  life expectancy, poverty, the black poverty rate, for example, is substantially higher than the
*  white and Asian poverty rate. Now, does that mean that the poverty rate statistic is biased? Of course
*  not. It means we live in an unequal society. The problem is the underlying reality. It's not
*  the statistic. And I think in the debate over standardized tests, a lot of people have conflated
*  those two things. They've said there are these racial and economic gaps. Therefore, the tests
*  must be biased. As opposed to there are these racial and economic gaps because there are racial and
*  economic gaps in almost everything in American life. In other words, the SATs are actually mirroring
*  back American reality, showing this deep problem that we have, effectively they're the messenger.
*  Right? And you're saying, don't shoot it. That's right. But if there are these gaps, why should we
*  use the SATs in college admissions? First of all, almost nobody is suggesting that the SATs should
*  be the only factor or even the dominant factor in college admissions. What the advocates for it
*  are saying is that it should be one factor. And the key thing here is that the SAT and the ACT
*  turn out to be a very good predictor of how students are going to do in college academically,
*  especially at the most selective colleges. The data shows that students who do better on the SAT
*  are going to have higher GPAs in college on average. The SAT and the ACT also predict what kind of
*  graduate schools these students are going to go to, which is a sign that they did better overall
*  in college. In fact, SATs turn out to be a significantly better predictor than high school grades do.
*  And why is the test better at predicting success than high school grades?
*  First of all, high schools are incredibly different. An A at one high school isn't the same thing as
*  an A at another high school. And second of all, something important has changed here, which is
*  grade inflation. High school students just get much higher grades than they used to. And so these
*  college admissions officers are left looking at transcripts where nearly all the students are
*  getting nearly all A's. They can't make decisions based only on that. Standardized tests are more
*  rigorous because there's more of a distribution and because everyone's taking the same test, got it.
*  And one of the key arguments for using the test is that there are kids from disadvantaged
*  backgrounds who do really well on the SAT and ACT. There are lower income kids who do well,
*  there are black and Hispanic kids who do well. And one of the arguments of the test advocates
*  is that those are specifically the kids who are being hurt in a system where they don't take the
*  test. They are not being given a chance to show their potential in a way that high school grades
*  just can't capture as well. There are too many students getting A's for any one of these colleges
*  who admit. So if they just are going to use grades, they're going to have to do a whole lot of
*  guesswork. They're going to have to say, we think this kid with straight A's is more promising than
*  this other kid with straight A's. Whereas when they combine the two, they say, oh look, we're looking
*  at these five kids, all of them from disadvantaged backgrounds, all of them have close to straight A's.
*  But look at these two or this one who really stand out on the standardized test. No, they didn't do
*  quite as well as a kid who went to a private school or a public magnet school, but they did well.
*  And that is a sign of enormous potential. And if you don't have the SAT and admissions officers
*  have told me this directly, if you don't have the SAT, you really have to guess which one of those
*  kids is likely to do the best at these colleges. Interesting. And it is a particular problem for kids
*  from disadvantaged backgrounds because these admissions officers have a much better sense of exactly
*  what the classes and the grades and the transcripts mean at these magnet schools and these private
*  schools that every year have multiple applicants to these schools. It's the high schools that don't
*  have that many applicants to the school when they're looking at these kids who have straight A's. And
*  they're choosing among kids all of whom have approaching straight A's at different high schools
*  that the standardized tests can be particularly helpful in saying that is the kid who is likely
*  could thrive on our campus. So in theory, this sounds like a useful strategy, right? But are
*  colleges actually using the SATs in this way? Well, MIT is a really interesting example here. And MIT
*  is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It's one of the most selective colleges in America.
*  It is also one of the only colleges that reinstated its requirement that applicants take the SAT
*  for the ACT. It's a very short list. And part of the reason that they did was when they went and they
*  studied the last 15 years, they found that the students who they had admitted despite having
*  lower test scores just didn't do as well there. And not only that, but they found that they could
*  admit a highly diverse class while using the SAT as one of the factors. So the current first-year
*  class at MIT, which was admitted using an SAT or ACT requirement, is about 30% black or Latino.
*  It is well more than 50% students of color. It's about 20% students who receive Pell grants, which
*  is the largest federal financial aid program, which means that MIT is more economically diverse than
*  a lot of other elite classes. And what the dean of admissions Stuart Schmill told me, he said,
*  look, using A's alone were not enough for us to admit a class. There are just too many kids who
*  get A's and we couldn't be sure that it was telling us that they could actually do MIT work. But when
*  we combined grades with standardized tests with other parts of the application, when we gave kids
*  credit for overcoming adversity, often economic adversity, but we also looked for kids who done
*  really well on the SAT. We were able to admit a class that was both diverse and extremely well-prepared
*  academically. So David, essentially what you're saying here is that the humble and hated SAT
*  is imperfect, but is the only one real yardstick we have in an imperfect system and doesn't need
*  to harm diversity if you use it in conjunction with other things. But my mind is going back to the
*  beginning of our conversation. You said that the test is still not being used by a lot of colleges
*  out there. Have they seen this data? Are they going to act accordingly? They have seen this data for
*  the most part. And that raises a fascinating question, Sabrina, which is given the data, why haven't
*  they gone back to using the SAT? We'll be right back.
*  Okay, so given the evidence you've laid out from me, David, why aren't schools eager to bring
*  back the SATs? I think it's important to say that actually most Americans are in favor of using
*  standardized tests. There's been some polling on this. 85% of Americans say that standardized tests
*  should be a factor in college admissions, a large majority of every racial group says they should
*  be a factor in college admissions. But colleges are of course not a cross-section of America.
*  In our polarized society, colleges are one of the places that are most strongly connected to
*  the political left in this country. So on the left, standardized tests have been for some time
*  unpopular and have become increasingly so. In part, because COVID gave colleges an opportunity
*  to rethink this. But in part because they think that it is an enemy of diversity, right? That is
*  correct. That one of the most passionate beliefs of the political left is the importance of diversity
*  and particularly racial diversity. And many people on college campuses have a genuine fear and a
*  reasonable fear that standardized tests could be used to reduce the diversity of their campuses.
*  Now these fears that the tests could reduce diversity on campus have a connection to the history
*  of these tests, although it's a somewhat nuanced history. So college standardized tests were
*  invented in the early 20th century as part of the progressive movement in this country. And that
*  was a complicated movement. It also had major strains of racism, eugenics in that movement.
*  And today we tend to think of racism in terms of skin color and particularly in terms of white
*  black. At the time, none of these elective colleges were entertaining the idea of admitting meaningful
*  numbers of black Americans. The race debate at time was actually quite different. And it is true
*  that some of the people who were designing the test expected that the tests would show that
*  Anglo-Saxons would do better than Jews and Southern Europeans. This was an era of debate about
*  American immigration policy. That was the flavor of the day of elites who were racist that people from
*  Southern Europe, Italians, Jews, Greeks would not be able to do as well. That's correct. Now some of
*  the other early advocates and inventors of the test had a different view. These were administrators
*  at Harvard who were worried that the American elite was drawing from too narrow a pool of people,
*  white Anglo-Saxon Protestants, and that if America was truly going to be a world leader,
*  it needed a stronger elite. And it actually needed to use these standardized tests to find students
*  who weren't naturally going to be at a place like Harvard. But in fact, deserved to be. In fact,
*  we're extremely talented. And they thought that the standardized tests could actually diversify
*  the students at these elite schools. So truly a very mixed history with this test in terms of the
*  intentions. Very mixed. You had people who both saw them as a way to restrict opportunity,
*  and you had people pushing for them who saw them as a way to expand opportunity. But today, critics
*  of the tests tend to emphasize only one half of that history. And part of the reason that they do
*  is they see a real connection to today. They say, look, the people who created these tests were racist.
*  And there are real gaps today by economic class and by race. And they connect these two. And they say,
*  this is just not something that we should be using. But I wonder based on what you told me with the
*  MIT example and how the SAT can be used to create diverse student bodies. Are colleges looking at that
*  and starting to say, maybe we shouldn't be so concerned? Maybe we should reconsider bringing the
*  SATs back. Yes, some of them are right now. But they're also anxious. And part of the reason they're
*  anxious is the Supreme Court decision last year that forbids colleges from using race in college
*  admissions. So in the wake of that decision, it's very clear that people on the political right,
*  some of the same people who brought that lawsuit that led to the Supreme Court decision are going to
*  be scouring the college admissions process. And looking for signs that colleges have deviated from
*  what the Supreme Court has said that they can do. A system that uses SATs has the potential to give
*  risk to those conservative critics. They can say, hey, wait a minute. Why did you admit this kid
*  of one race who has a 1400 when you rejected this kid of another race with a 1500? Whereas a system
*  without standardized tests is just fuzzier. It's more subjective. And it potentially creates less
*  legal jeopardy for colleges. And in fact, if I remember correctly, it was also precisely the
*  argument the plaintiffs in the Harvard case were bringing before the Supreme Court, right?
*  Yeah. Hey, I got a high score. And they didn't let me in because of my ethnicity.
*  It was one part of their argument, but it was an important part.
*  And how big of a legal risk is this for these colleges?
*  I think we don't yet know. Remember, the idea of using the SAT and college admissions is not just
*  a hypothetical MIT is doing it. Georgetown is doing it. Some of the top public universities in the
*  country are doing it. They all say they are doing it. They are creating diverse classes. And they
*  are doing it while following the law. And if when the evidence continues to emerge and it becomes
*  clear, oh, it is possible to use the SAT and still have diverse classes, my instinct is the legal
*  risk may not be as big as college's fear, but I just don't think we know yet.
*  So on the one hand, schools have all of these reasons for not wanting to require the SATs.
*  But on the other, you have this data showing that SATs can be pretty useful for college admissions,
*  which makes me wonder, is there a cost to schools not using the SATs?
*  Well, it depends who you ask. So critics of the test would say there really isn't that much of a
*  cost that in these schools, we're talking about phenomenally qualified applicants, even those who
*  would do somewhat worse on the standardized test. These students are not going to drop out for
*  the most part of these schools. They're still going to graduate and they're going to have successful
*  lives. And what the critics of the test say is once you start using the test, it's really hard not
*  to overuse the test because it's a number. And instead of obsessing over modest differences
*  between how people do on this test and modest differences and how they might do at college,
*  we should instead see schools as engines of social mobility and we should ensure they're
*  admitting a diverse class of qualified students and not worry too much about whether they're
*  admitting the very most qualified students. Just work harder to find the best students and not
*  obsess over that number. Yeah, and work harder to educate them once they're there.
*  And what the advocates for the test would say is look, these are the world's finest universities.
*  Part of their mission is to develop new cures for diseases that are killing people
*  and develop new forms of energy that help reduce the damage from climate change.
*  They have a mission of excellence and part of that mission is to go find the students
*  who are going to be able to do that work best, to do the research, to become the researchers of
*  tomorrow and educate them and set them up to succeed. And so this actually gets at something
*  really fascinating, which is I think one of the criticisms of higher education from the political
*  center and the political right have been that higher education doesn't care that much about
*  excellence anymore. And the standardized tests have become part of this criticism.
*  The critics of higher ed have said, look, there is this test that can tell you who will do better
*  in school and yet you are ignoring. And that has become wrapped up in this whole larger political
*  debate that we're having right now about higher education.
*  So there's an incredibly basic question at the heart of all of this, which is what is higher
*  education actually for? Like what's the end goal of it? Is it to make classrooms more diverse
*  and to alleviate inequality in America? Or is it to create merit-based places where talented
*  students can individually reach their full potential?
*  Yes, and almost everyone in higher education would say the answer is both.
*  And I'll tell you my reading of the evidence is that both is reasonable. I do think that colleges
*  can be both diverse and excellent. But there's no question that there are some tensions here.
*  And in particular, there's no question that a system with standardized tests runs the risk
*  of reducing diversity and a system without standardized tests runs the risk of reducing excellence.
*  So those two things are intention and we're living in a pretty important moment in higher education
*  right now. So what's the answer? What's going to happen?
*  We're going to find out soon. Schools are looking right now at their admissions policies.
*  They're looking at this new evidence on the SAT and ACT. They're trying to figure out whether to
*  reinstate their test requirements or to remain test optional. They're trying to respond to the
*  Supreme Court decision on admissions. And it's clearly a really tumultuous time in higher education.
*  It's also a really fascinating time because schools are trying to decide what do we want to be?
*  David, thank you. Thanks so much, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. The US military struck targets in Yemen on Tuesday.
*  The third attack on the Houthis since a US-led air-enabled barrage last week.
*  The American strike destroyed four missiles that posed a threat to ships in the Red Sea.
*  The Houthis, backed by Iran, are firing on ships in protest against the war in Gaza.
*  And the US and its allies are scrambling to keep the critical pathway for global trade open.
