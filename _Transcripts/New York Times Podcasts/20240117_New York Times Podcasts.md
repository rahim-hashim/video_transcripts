# The Messy Fight Over the SAT
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MS-tFVwc7Q)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Many American colleges have stopped requiring standardized tests, like the SATs, on the
*  theory that they hurt diversity.
*  But new research suggests that colleges may have made a mistake.
*  My colleague David Leonhardt, on the war on the SATs, and why colleges are still reluctant
*  to bring them back.
*  It's Wednesday, January 17th.
*  So David, ever since the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions,
*  it's opened up this larger conversation around the college admissions process.
*  What's fair, and what tools do we have to create diverse student bodies now?
*  And recently, you've been reporting on the SATs in this context.
*  Tell us why you decided to focus on the SATs in particular.
*  There's been a radical change with standardized tests in this country, both the SATs and the
*  ACTs, which many students also take when applying to college.
*  For years, people have not liked the SAT.
*  I'm sure you remember taking it, Sabrina.
*  It's not fun to take.
*  Who likes the SAT?
*  Yeah.
*  I can still remember the dark gym I went and sat in anxiously 35 years ago.
*  And on top of the inherent unpleasantness of standardized tests, I think a lot of people,
*  particularly on the political left, have worried that standardized tests are an enemy of diversity.
*  And so there's been this criticism bubbling up, and then comes COVID.
*  During the pandemic, it was basically impossible for teenagers to go out and take these standardized
*  tests.
*  And so one college after another announced, you no longer have to take the SAT or ACT
*  to apply here.
*  They went, that's optional, as they called it.
*  And is this most colleges?
*  Yes, nearly all colleges.
*  And when the colleges announced it, they said this is a temporary move.
*  But almost all colleges have remained test optional.
*  So that's a really big change in college admissions.
*  And I got interested in that change to understand what has it meant that colleges have moved
*  away from these standardized tests that they required for decades.
*  It also turns out that there's been some new research looking at what is the use of the
*  SAT?
*  What does it tell you about applicants?
*  And in part because of that new research, and in part because of the experiences that
*  colleges have had with an admissions system that doesn't include standardized tests, there
*  are now a bunch of people in higher education who are saying we made a mistake and we should
*  bring back our test requirements.
*  OK, so let's talk about the case to bring it back.
*  Now you were actually on the show last summer and you talked about some of this new research.
*  Remind us briefly of those findings, David, and tell us where the SATs come into them.
*  So this in-depth study looking at college admissions that was released last summer ended
*  up finding that the richest applicants have huge advantages in college admissions.
*  And a lot of people have assumed that the SAT must be one of the advantages that richer
*  applicants have.
*  Because think about it, if you're rich, you can take test prep classes.
*  You can take the SAT multiple times.
*  You also might go to a private school or a top public school that's going to prepare
*  you better for the test.
*  There are all kinds of ways in which you might have an advantage on the SAT because of wealth.
*  But it turns out that many of the other aspects of the admissions process are more tilted
*  toward the rich than standardized tests.
*  Think about extracurricular activities.
*  Who can pay to take music lessons?
*  Who can pay to travel to foreign countries and participate in projects that expand their
*  horizons?
*  Right.
*  Tours for Cancer and a summer project.
*  Exactly.
*  Who can pay to participate on travel sports teams?
*  And it's not just extracurriculars.
*  Think about all of the editing that highly educated affluent parents do of their children's
*  college essays.
*  Think about the quality of a school recommendation that you're going to get if you go to a private
*  school as opposed to a public school where the guidance counselor has 500 students whom
*  they're advising.
*  And so actually standardized tests, a single test that everybody must take, the same test,
*  end up being less tilted toward the wealthy than many other aspects of the process like
*  extracurriculars and essay writing and school recommendations.
*  So let's pause and unpack that a little bit, David, because I think it will be surprising
*  for listeners.
*  I mean, SATs, you think test prep, you think advantage parents pouring money, pouring time,
*  effort into this test prep.
*  Doesn't that confer advantage on the wealthy?
*  Well, first, I should make clear there are gaps along racial and economic lines in average
*  SAT scores.
*  Upper income students do better on average than lower income students.
*  White and Asian students do better on average than black and Latino students.
*  And this is probably the main point that the critics of the tests make.
*  They say, look at these gaps, the test must be biased.
*  But let's start with test prep.
*  The evidence suggests that test prep actually causes only a tiny part of these gaps, maybe
*  not that different from zero.
*  And the way to see that is to look at other tests that millions of students across the
*  country take, but don't take test prep for.
*  And maybe the best known one is called the NAEP.
*  Its nickname is the nation's report card.
*  It's a test nationwide that elementary school students and middle school students take.
*  There's a good chance that you or your students have taken the NAEP in your state, but that
*  they called it something other than the NAEP locally.
*  And so no one takes NAEP test prep because for an individual student, the NAEP doesn't
*  really matter.
*  It's instead used to see which school districts are doing well, which states are doing well.
*  It's a tool for states and local school districts to see how they're doing.
*  That's exactly right.
*  You see headlines once a year come out about how much fourth graders or eighth graders
*  have learned in the United States.
*  That comes from the NAEP.
*  And what's really striking is that the economic gaps that is between how richer and poorer
*  students do and the racial gaps are incredibly similar on the NAEP as they are to the SAT.
*  And so that is another way of saying test prep just isn't that big a deal.
*  OK, so there are these gaps in both the SATs and the NAEPs, these other important national
*  tests, and they're gaps, as you said, along economic and racial lines.
*  So if it isn't test prep that's actually driving the gaps, then I guess the question
*  is what is?
*  And I'm thinking it has something to do with inequality in America.
*  Yes, the tests are picking up real inequities in American life.
*  Think about it.
*  We live in a society with enormous economic and racial inequality.
*  You see this in nearly every measure of American life.
*  Home ownership, life expectancy, poverty.
*  The black poverty rate, for example, is substantially higher than the white and Asian poverty rate.
*  Now does that mean that the poverty rate statistic is biased?
*  Of course not.
*  It means we live in an unequal society.
*  The problem is the underlying reality.
*  It's not the statistic.
*  And I think in the debate over standardized tests, a lot of people have conflated those
*  two things.
*  They've said there are these racial and economic gaps, therefore the tests must be biased,
*  as opposed to there are these racial and economic gaps because there are racial and economic
*  gaps in almost everything in American life.
*  In other words, the SATs are actually mirroring back American reality, you know, showing this
*  deep problem that we have.
*  Like effectively, they're the messenger, right?
*  And you're saying don't shoot it.
*  That's right.
*  But if there are these gaps, why should we use the SATs in college admissions?
*  First of all, almost nobody is suggesting that the SATs should be the only factor or
*  even the dominant factor in college admissions.
*  What the advocates for it are saying is that it should be one factor.
*  And the key thing here is that the SAT and the ACT turn out to be a very good predictor
*  of how students are going to do in college academically, especially at the most selective
*  colleges.
*  The data shows that students who do better on the SAT are going to have higher GPAs in
*  college on average.
*  The SAT and the ACT also predict what kind of graduate schools these students are going
*  to go to, which is a sign that they did better overall in college.
*  In fact, SATs turn out to be a significantly better predictor than high school grades do.
*  And why is the test better at predicting success than high school grades?
*  First of all, high schools are incredibly different.
*  An A at one high school isn't the same thing as an A at another high school.
*  And second of all, something important has changed here, which is grade inflation.
*  High school students just get much higher grades than they used to.
*  And so these college admissions officers are left looking at transcripts where nearly all
*  the students are getting nearly all A's.
*  They can't make decisions based only on that.
*  Standardized tests are more rigorous because there's more of a distribution and because
*  everyone's taking the same test.
*  Got it.
*  And one of the key arguments for using the test is that there are kids from disadvantaged
*  backgrounds who do really well on the SAT and ACT.
*  There are lower income kids who do well.
*  There are black and Hispanic kids who do well.
*  And one of the arguments of the test advocates is that those are specifically the kids who
*  are being hurt in a system where they don't take the test.
*  They are not being given a chance to show their potential in a way that high school
*  grades just can't capture as well.
*  There are too many students getting A's for any one of these colleges who admit.
*  So if they just are going to use grades, they're going to have to do a whole lot of guesswork.
*  They're going to have to say, we think this kid with straight A's is more promising than
*  this other kid with straight A's.
*  Whereas when they combine the two, they say, oh, look, we're looking at these five kids,
*  all of them from disadvantaged backgrounds.
*  All of them have close to straight A's.
*  But look at these two or this one who really stand out on the standardized test.
*  No, they didn't do quite as well as a kid who went to a private school or a public magnet
*  school, but they did well.
*  And that is a sign of enormous potential.
*  And if you don't have the SAT, and admissions officers have told me this directly, if you
*  don't have the SAT, you really have to guess which one of those kids is likely to do the
*  best at these colleges.
*  And it is a particular problem for kids from disadvantaged backgrounds because these admissions
*  officers have a much better sense of exactly what the classes and the grades and the transcripts
*  mean at these magnet schools and these private schools that every year have multiple applicants
*  to these schools.
*  It's the high schools that don't have that many applicants to the school when they're
*  looking at these kids who have straight A's and they're choosing among kids, all of whom
*  have approaching straight A's at different high schools, that the standardized tests
*  can be particularly helpful in saying that is the kid who is likely to thrive on our
*  campus.
*  So in theory, this sounds like a useful strategy, right?
*  But are colleges actually using the SATs in this way?
*  Well, MIT is a really interesting example here.
*  And MIT is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
*  It's one of the most selective colleges in America.
*  It is also one of the only colleges that reinstated its requirement that applicants take
*  the SAT or the ACT.
*  It's a very short list.
*  And part of the reason that they did was when they went and they studied the last 15
*  years, they found that the students whom they had admitted, despite having lower test
*  scores, just didn't do as well there.
*  And not only that, but they found that they could admit a highly diverse class while
*  using the SAT as one of the factors.
*  So the current first year class at MIT, which was admitted using an SAT or ACT requirement,
*  is about 30 percent Black or Latino.
*  It is well more than 50 percent students of color.
*  It's about 20 percent students who receive Pell Grants, which is the largest federal
*  financial aid program, which means that MIT is more economically diverse than a lot of
*  other elite classes.
*  And what the Dean of Admissions, Stuart Schmill, told me is he said, look, using A's alone
*  were not enough for us to admit a class.
*  There are just too many kids who get A's and we couldn't be sure that it was telling us
*  that they could actually do MIT work.
*  But when we combined grades with standardized tests, with other parts of the application,
*  when we gave kids credit for overcoming adversity, often economic adversity, but we also
*  looked for kids who'd done really well on the SAT, we were able to admit a class that was
*  both diverse and extremely well prepared academically.
*  So, David, essentially what you're saying here is that the humble and hated SAT is imperfect,
*  but is the only one real yardstick we have in an imperfect system and doesn't need to
*  harm diversity if you use it in conjunction with other things.
*  But, you know, my mind is going back to the beginning of our conversation.
*  You said that the test is still not being used by a lot of colleges out there.
*  Have they seen this data?
*  Are they going to act accordingly?
*  They have seen this data for the most part.
*  And that raises a fascinating question, Sabrina, which is given the data, why haven't they
*  gone back to using the SAT?
*  We'll be right back.
*  OK, so given the evidence you've laid out for me, David, why aren't schools eager to bring back
*  the SATs?
*  I think it's important to say that actually most Americans are in favor of using standardized
*  tests. There's been some polling on this.
*  Eighty five percent of Americans say that standardized tests should be a factor in college
*  admissions. A large majority of every racial group says they should be a factor in college
*  admissions. But colleges are, of course, not a cross-section of America.
*  In our polarized society, colleges are one of the places that are most strongly connected to
*  the political left in this country.
*  So on the left, standardized tests have been for some time unpopular and have become
*  increasingly so, in part because COVID gave colleges an opportunity to rethink this.
*  But in part because they think that it is an enemy of diversity, right?
*  That is correct. That one of the most passionate beliefs of the political left is the
*  importance of diversity and particularly racial diversity.
*  And many people on college campuses have a genuine fear and a reasonable fear that
*  standardized tests could be used to reduce the diversity of their campuses.
*  Now, these fears that the tests could reduce diversity on campus have a connection to the
*  history of these tests, although it's a somewhat nuanced history.
*  So college standardized tests were invented in the early 20th century as part of the
*  progressive movement in this country.
*  And that was a complicated movement.
*  It also had major strains of racism, eugenics in that movement.
*  And today we tend to think of racism in terms of skin color and particularly in terms of
*  white, black. At the time, none of these selective colleges were entertaining the idea of
*  admitting meaningful numbers of Black Americans.
*  The race debate at the time was actually quite different.
*  And it is true that some of the people who were designing the test expected that the
*  tests would show that Anglo-Saxons would do better than Jews and Southern Europeans.
*  This was an era of debate about American immigration policy.
*  That was the flavor of the day of elites who were racist, that people from Southern
*  Europe, Italians, Jews, Greeks, would not be able to do as well.
*  That's correct. Now, some of the other early advocates and inventors of the test had a
*  different view. These were administrators at Harvard who were worried that the American
*  elite was drawing from too narrow a pool of people, white Anglo-Saxon Protestants, and
*  that if America was truly going to be a world leader, it needed a stronger elite and it
*  actually needed to use these standardized tests to find students who weren't naturally
*  going to be at a place like Harvard, but in fact deserve to be.
*  In fact, we're extremely talented.
*  And they thought that the standardized tests could actually diversify the students at
*  these elite schools.
*  So truly a very mixed history with this test in terms of the intentions.
*  Very mixed. You had people who both saw them as a way to restrict opportunity and you had
*  people pushing for them who saw them as a way to expand opportunity.
*  But today, critics of the tests tend to emphasize only one half of that history.
*  And part of the reason that they do is they see a real connection to today.
*  They say, look, the people who created these tests were racist.
*  And there are real gaps today by economic class and by race.
*  And they connect these two and they say this is just not something that we should be using.
*  But I wonder, based on what you told me with the MIT example and how the SAT can be used to
*  create diverse student bodies, are colleges looking at that and starting to say maybe we
*  shouldn't be so concerned?
*  Maybe we should reconsider bringing the SATs back?
*  Yes, some of them are right now, but they're also anxious.
*  And part of the reason they're anxious is the Supreme Court decision last year that forbids
*  colleges from using race in college admissions.
*  So in the wake of that decision, it's very clear that people on the political right, some
*  of the same people who brought that lawsuit that led to the Supreme Court decision, are going to
*  be scouring the college admissions process and looking for signs that colleges have
*  deviated from what the Supreme Court has said that they can do.
*  A system that uses SATs has the potential to give brist to those conservative critics.
*  They can say, hey, wait a minute, why did you admit this kid of one race who has a 1400 when
*  you rejected this kid of another race with a 1500?
*  Whereas a system without standardized tests is just fuzzier, it's more subjective and it
*  potentially creates less legal jeopardy for colleges.
*  And in fact, if I remember correctly, it was also precisely the argument the plaintiffs in
*  the Harvard case were bringing before the Supreme Court, right?
*  Hey, I got a high score and they didn't let me in because of my ethnicity.
*  It was one part of their argument, but it was an important part.
*  And how big of a legal risk is this for these colleges?
*  I think we don't yet know.
*  Remember, the idea of using the SAT in college admissions is not just a hypothetical.
*  MIT is doing it.
*  Georgetown is doing it.
*  Some of the top public universities in the country are doing it.
*  They all say they are doing it.
*  They are creating diverse classes and they are doing it while following the law.
*  And if when the evidence continues to emerge and it becomes clear, oh, it is possible to use
*  the SAT and still have diverse classes.
*  My instinct is the legal risk may not be as big as colleges fear, but I just don't think we
*  know yet.
*  So on the one hand, schools have all of these reasons for not wanting to require the
*  SATs. But on the other, you have this data showing that SATs can be pretty useful for
*  college admissions, which makes me wonder, is there a cost to schools not using the
*  SATs?
*  Well, it depends who you ask.
*  So critics of the test would say there really isn't that much of a cost that in these
*  schools we're talking about phenomenally qualified applicants, even those who would do
*  somewhat worse on the standardized test.
*  These students are not going to drop out for the most part of these schools.
*  They're still going to graduate and they're going to have successful lives.
*  And what the critics of the test say is once you start using the test, it's really hard
*  not to overuse the test because it's a number.
*  And instead of obsessing over modest differences between how people do on this test and
*  modest differences in how they might do at college, we should instead see schools as
*  engines of social mobility and we should ensure they're admitting a diverse class of
*  qualified students and not worry too much about whether they're admitting the very most
*  qualified students.
*  Just work harder to find the best students and not obsess over that number.
*  Yeah, and work harder to educate them once they're there.
*  And what the advocates for the test would say is, look, these are the world's finest
*  universities. Part of their mission is to develop new cures for diseases that are killing
*  people and develop new forms of energy that help reduce the damage from climate change.
*  They have a mission of excellence.
*  And part of that mission is to go find the students who are going to be able to do that
*  work best, to do the research, to become the researchers of tomorrow and educate them and
*  set them up to succeed.
*  And so this actually gets at something really fascinating, which is, I think, one of the
*  criticisms of higher education from the political center and the political right have been
*  that higher education doesn't care that much about excellence anymore.
*  And the standardized tests have become part of this criticism.
*  The critics of higher ed have said, look, there is this test that can tell you who will do
*  better in school.
*  And yet you are ignoring it.
*  And that has become wrapped up in this whole larger political debate that we're having
*  right now about higher education.
*  So there's an incredibly basic question at the heart of all of this, which is what is
*  higher education actually for?
*  Like, what's the end goal of it?
*  Is it to make classrooms more diverse and to alleviate inequality in America?
*  Or is it to create merit based places where talented students can individually
*  reach their full potential?
*  Yes, and almost everyone in higher education would say the answer is both.
*  And I'll tell you, my reading of the evidence is that both is reasonable.
*  I do think that colleges can be both diverse and excellent.
*  But there's no question that there are some tensions here.
*  And in particular, there's no question that a system with standardized tests runs the
*  risk of reducing diversity and a system without standardized tests runs the risk of
*  reducing excellence.
*  So those two things are in tension and we're living in a pretty important moment in
*  higher education right now.
*  So what's the answer?
*  What's going to happen?
*  We're going to find out soon.
*  Schools are looking right now at their admissions policies.
*  They're looking at this new evidence on the SAT and ACT.
*  They're trying to figure out whether to reinstate their test requirements or to
*  remain test optional.
*  They're trying to respond to the Supreme Court decision on admissions.
*  And it's clearly a really tumultuous time in higher education.
*  It's also a really fascinating time because schools are trying to decide what do we
*  want to be.
*  David, thank you.
*  Thanks so much, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  The U.S. military struck targets in Yemen on Tuesday, the third attack on the Houthis
*  since a U.S.-led air and naval barrage last week.
*  The American strike destroyed four missiles that posed a threat to ships in the Red
*  Sea. The Houthis, backed by Iran, are firing on ships in protest against the war in
*  Gaza. And the U.S.
*  and its allies are scrambling to keep the critical pathway for global trade open.
