# A Terrorist Attack in Russia
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2prryDGW2GE)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernese, and this is The Daily.
*  A terrorist attack on a concert hall near Moscow Friday night killed more than 100 people
*  and injured scores more.
*  It was the deadliest attack in Russia in decades.
*  Today, my colleague Anton Trinovsky, on the uncomfortable question it raises for Russia's
*  president Vladimir Putin, has his focus on the war in Ukraine left his country more vulnerable
*  to other threats?
*  It's Monday, March 25th.
*  So, Anton, tell us about this horrific attack in Russia.
*  When did you first hear about it?
*  So it was Friday night around 830 Moscow time that we started seeing reports about a terrorist
*  attack at a concert hall just outside Moscow.
*  I frankly wasn't sure right at the beginning how serious this was because we have seen
*  quite a lot of attacks inside Russia over the last two years since the full-scale invasion
*  of Ukraine.
*  And it was hard to make sense of right away.
*  But then within a few hours, it was really looking like we were seeing the worst terrorist
*  attack in or around the Russian capital in more than 20 years.
*  On Friday night, Krakow City Hall was the venue for a concert by an old-time Russian
*  rock group called Picnic.
*  It was a sold-out show.
*  Thousands of people were expected to be there.
*  And before the start of the concert, it appears that four gunmen in camouflage walked into
*  the venue and started shooting.
*  We started seeing videos on social media, just incredibly awful graphic footage of these
*  men shooting concertgoers at point-blank range.
*  In one of the videos, we see one of them slitting the throat of one of the concertgoers.
*  And then what appears to have happened is that they set the concert hall on fire.
*  Russian investigators said they had some kind of flammable liquid that they lit on fire
*  and basically tried to burn down this huge concert hall with wounded people in it.
*  Some of these people ended up trapped as the building burned.
*  As eventually the roof of this concert hall collapsed, and it seems as though much of
*  the casualties actually came as a result of the fire as opposed to as a result of the shooting.
*  The actual attack, it looks like, didn't take more than 15 to 30 minutes, at which point
*  the four men were able to escape.
*  They got into a white Renault sedan and fled the scene.
*  It took the authorities clearly a while to arrive.
*  The attackers were able to spread this horrific violence for, as I said, at least 15 minutes
*  or so.
*  So among other things, there's a lot of questions being raised right now about why the official
*  response took so long.
*  And you said the perpetrators got away.
*  What happened next?
*  So it looks like they were caught at some point hours after the attack.
*  On Saturday morning, the Kremlin said that 11 people had been arrested in connection
*  to the attack, including all four perpetrators.
*  They were taken into custody, according to the Russian authorities, in the Bransk region
*  of Russia, roughly a five-hour drive from the concert hall in southwestern Russia, also
*  pretty close to the border with Ukraine.
*  Obviously, we have to take everything that the Russian authorities are saying with a
*  grain of salt.
*  And as we've been reporting on this throughout the weekend, we have very much tried to verify
*  all the claims that the Russian authorities are making independently.
*  And so our colleagues in the Visual Investigations Unit of the Times have been working very hard
*  on that.
*  And what we can say, based on the footage of the attack that was taken by many different
*  individuals and posted to social media, it very much looks like the four men who were
*  detained, who Russia says were the attackers.
*  In fact, are the same people who are seen doing the shooting in those videos of the
*  attack, judging by their clothes, judging by their hairstyle, judging by their build
*  and other identifying characteristics that our colleagues have been looking at.
*  So it does appear that by Saturday morning, the men who directly carried out this attack
*  had been taken into custody.
*  Wow. So the Russian government actually apprehended the perpetrators, according to our reporting
*  work that our colleagues have done.
*  So who are these guys?
*  We don't know much about them.
*  The Russian government says that none of them are Russian citizens.
*  After the arrest, throughout the weekend, videos, short clips of interrogations of these
*  men have been popping up on the Telegram social network, clearly leaked or provided by Russian
*  law enforcement.
*  You see these men bloodied, hurt.
*  And is this Russian interrogators abusing them?
*  Yes, that is very much what it looks like.
*  And it's also notable that the Russian authorities aren't even hiding it.
*  Two of the suspects in those videos are heard speaking Tajik.
*  So that's the language spoken in Tajikistan, a Central Asian country, but also in some
*  of the surrounding countries, including Afghanistan.
*  At the end of the day, this is still a very much a developing situation.
*  And there's a ton that we don't know.
*  But hours after the attack, the Islamic State, ISIS, took responsibility.
*  They then really tried to emphasize this by even releasing a video on Saturday showing
*  the attack taking place as it was filmed apparently by one of the attackers.
*  And US intelligence officials have told our colleagues in Washington that they indeed
*  believe this to be true, that they believe that this ISIS offshoot did carry out this
*  attack.
*  Wow.
*  So the Americans actually think that ISIS, the extremist group that we know so well from
*  Iraq and Syria, carried out this attack.
*  Yes.
*  And all of this is really remarkable because just a few weeks ago, on March 7th, the United
*  States actually warned publicly that something just like this could happen.
*  The US embassy in Moscow issued a security alert urging US citizens to avoid large gatherings
*  over the next 48 hours.
*  They said that the embassy is monitoring reports that extremists have imminent plans to target
*  large gatherings in Moscow to include concerts.
*  Crazy.
*  That is a very specific warning.
*  Absolutely.
*  And of course, the statement mentioned that specific 48 hour timeframe, but nevertheless,
*  it feels really significant.
*  And did the Russian authorities respond to that?
*  They did.
*  And frankly, they responded mostly by ridiculing it.
*  This is all obviously happening against the backdrop of the worst conflict between Moscow
*  and the West since the depths of the Cold War.
*  And so Vladimir Putin actually publicly dismissed this warning.
*  He called it blackmail in a speech that he gave just three days before the attack last
*  Tuesday.
*  So despite the specificity publicly, at least the Russian authorities did not take it seriously.
*  That is remarkable.
*  And so three days later, this huge attack happens.
*  Where is Putin in all of this?
*  And who is he blaming?
*  What's his version of events?
*  So he's coming off this Russian election season, as you know, where he declared this very stage
*  managed victory and after that had been taking a victory lap of sorts.
*  But Putin doesn't appear on camera until around 19 hours after the attack.
*  At that point, Russian state television airs a five minute speech by Putin.
*  Dear citizens of Russia, I am addressing you...
*  He's sitting at this nondescript desk surrounded by two Russian flags, but it's not clear where
*  he is located at that point.
*  It doesn't look like he's at the Kremlin.
*  And Anton, what does he say?
*  The whole country, the whole nation is mourning with you.
*  On March 24, he declares the horror of this attack.
*  He declares Sunday a national day of mourning.
*  He says the most important thing is to make sure that the people who did this aren't able
*  to carry out more violence.
*  He also says that the four men who carried out the attack were captured as they were
*  moving toward Ukraine.
*  And he claims that based on preliminary information, as he put it, there were people on the Ukrainian
*  side who were going to help these men cross the border safely.
*  And remember, this is an extremely dangerous militarized border given that Russia and Ukraine
*  have been in a state of full-scale war for over two years now.
*  And as he ends the speech, he says that Russia will punish the perpetrators, whoever they
*  may be, whoever may have sent them.
*  So what's important about all that is, first of all, that Putin is not the only one who
*  Putin did not mention the apparent Islamic extremist connection here that Western officials
*  have been talking about and that is in front of all of us, given that Islamic State has
*  claimed responsibility for the attack.
*  But he does set the stage for blaming Ukraine for this horrific tragedy, even though it
*  seems that Putin and the Russian government may be alone in thinking that.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Anton, the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for this attack, but Putin ignores that and
*  kind of obliquely points the finger at Ukraine.
*  What do we actually know about who did this?
*  Well, let's start with the group that claimed responsibility for this attack.
*  That's ISIS, the Islamic State.
*  And in particular, US officials are talking about a branch of ISIS called ISIS-K or Islamic
*  State Khorasan, which is an Islamic State affiliate that's primarily active in Afghanistan
*  and that in recent years has gained this reputation for extreme brutality.
*  They might be best known in the US for being the group behind the Kabul airport bombing
*  back in 2021, right after the Taliban took over when thousands of Afghans were trying
*  to escape.
*  That was a bombing that killed 13 American troops and 171 civilians, and it really raised
*  ISIS-K's profile.
*  So this terrorist group is mainly based in Afghanistan.
*  What do they want with Russia?
*  So what's notable is our colleague Eric Schmidt in Washington talked to an expert over the
*  weekend who said ISIS-K has really developed an obsession with Russia and Putin over the
*  last two years.
*  They say Russia has Muslim blood on its hands.
*  So it looks like the primary driver in this enmity against Russia is Russia's alliance
*  with Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, who is also a sworn enemy of ISIS.
*  And Russia intervened, of course, on Assad's behalf in the Syrian civil war starting back
*  in 2015.
*  But it's not just Syria.
*  So the experts we've talked to say that in the ISIS-K propaganda, you also hear about
*  Russia's wars in the southern region of Chechnya in the 1990s and the early 2000s, and also
*  even about the Soviet Union's war in Afghanistan throughout the 1980s.
*  There's this really long arc of Russia's and the Soviet Union's wars in Muslim regions
*  that appears to be driving this violent hatred of Russia on the part of ISIS-K.
*  Okay, so ISIS-K is pointing not only to Russia's actions in Syria, but actually further back
*  into Russian history, even Soviet history, to its war in Chechnya and then to the Soviet
*  war in Afghanistan.
*  Yet Putin, in his speech, ignores the group entirely and instead points in the direction
*  of Ukraine.
*  Is there a chance that this attack could have been carried out by Ukraine?
*  Well, look, it is true that Ukraine has carried out attacks inside Russia that put Russian
*  civilians at risk.
*  There have been several bombings that American officials have ascribed to parts of the Ukrainian
*  government.
*  Perhaps most famously, there was the bombing that killed Daria Dugina, the daughter of
*  a leading Russian ultranationalist, back in the summer of 2022.
*  That was a bombing that happened just outside Moscow.
*  And of course, there have been various drone strikes by Ukraine against things like Russian
*  energy infrastructure, even just in the last few weeks.
*  But we really don't see any evidence right now of any connection of the Ukrainian state
*  to this attack.
*  US officials tell us they don't see anything and we haven't in our own reporting come across
*  such a connection either.
*  And there is, of course, the context of the US has said very clearly that they don't want
*  to see Ukraine carrying out big attacks inside Russia.
*  American officials have said that doing so is counterproductive, could lead to the risk
*  of greater escalation by Putin in his war.
*  And we're in an extremely sensitive time right now when it comes to US support for Ukraine.
*  The US of course has given all these weapons, tens of billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine.
*  But right now, $60 billion in aid are stuck in US Congress.
*  And you would think that Ukraine wouldn't want to do anything right now.
*  That could risk that.
*  That could risk that.
*  Exactly.
*  I mean, also, let's just say, I mean, this was an incredibly horrific attack.
*  And we haven't seen anything from Ukraine in the way they've carried themselves in defending
*  against Russia in this war that would make us think they would be capable of doing something
*  like this.
*  Anton, just to step back for a moment.
*  I mean, it's interesting, you know, because this attack, it really doesn't remotely fit
*  into Putin's obsession about where the threat is coming from in the world to Russia, right?
*  His obsession is Ukraine.
*  And this kind of short circuits that.
*  Absolutely.
*  I mean, Russia has had a real Islamic extremism problem for decades, going back to the 1990s,
*  to those brutal wars against Chechen separatists that were a big part of Putin coming to power
*  and developing his strongman image.
*  So it's really remarkable how we've arrived at this turning point here for Putin, where
*  he used to be someone who really portrayed himself as the man keeping Russians safe from
*  terrorism.
*  Now, the threat of terrorism coming from Islamic extremists doesn't really fit into that narrative
*  that Putin has, because now Putin's narrative is all about the threat from Ukraine and the
*  that the most important thing to do now for Russian national security is to win the war
*  against Ukraine.
*  And does a security failure here have anything to do with Russia actually being obsessed
*  with Ukraine?
*  Like it's kind of taken its eye off the ball?
*  Well, look, the Russian Domestic Intelligence Agency, the FSB, they're the ones who are
*  supposed to keep the country safe from terrorism.
*  And that has also been the agency that has been charged with asserting control over the
*  territories in Ukraine that Putin has occupied.
*  And the FSB has been spending all this time hunting down dissidents of Putin.
*  Just a few hours before the attack on Friday, Russia officially classified the so-called
*  LGBT movement, as they put it, on their list of terrorists and extremists.
*  So terrorists in the current Putin narrative are anyone who disagrees with him, who criticizes
*  the war, and who doesn't fit into the Kremlin's conception of so-called traditional values,
*  which has become such a big Putin talking point.
*  So the FSB has been pretty busy, but not in terms of Islamic terrorism, in terms of its
*  own people.
*  Exactly.
*  I don't know for sure, obviously, how the FSB is apportioning its resources, but there's
*  a lot of reason to believe that as the leadership of that organization has been looking at Putin's
*  priorities in Ukraine, and in terms of cracking down on dissent domestically, they could well
*  have lost sight of the risks of actual terrorism inside Russia.
*  Which is pretty remarkable, right, Anton?
*  As you and I know, and we've spoken a lot about on the show, a big part of the reason
*  that Putin actually appeals is argument to Russians, is that he's the security guy.
*  Think what you will about him.
*  He's the guy who's fundamentally going to keep you safe.
*  And here we have this attack.
*  That's right.
*  And so he needs to continue making the case that he knows how to keep Russia safe.
*  And that's why my colleagues and I have been watching a lot of Russian state TV this weekend.
*  This ISIS claim of responsibility barely comes up.
*  And when it does come up, it's often being referred to as fake news.
*  Instead, Russian propaganda is already assuming that it was Ukraine and the West that did
*  this.
*  We'll see if the Russian public buys that.
*  But if you look at the way the last two years have gone in Russia, I think you have to draw
*  the conclusion that Russian propaganda is extremely powerful.
*  I think if this message continues, it's quite likely that very many Russians will believe
*  that Ukraine and the West had something to do with this attack.
*  And so the worry now, as we look ahead, is that Putin could end up using this to try
*  to escalate his war even further, which shows us why this is such a tenuous and perilous
*  moment because at the same time, this attack reminds us that Russia faces other security
*  risks.
*  And as Putin deepens that conflict with the West, he may be doing so at the cost of introducing
*  even more instability inside the country.
*  Anton, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  Late Sunday night, the four men suspected of carrying out the concert hall attack were
*  arraigned in a court in Moscow and charged with committing an act of terrorism.
*  All four are from Tajikistan but worked as migrant laborers in Russia.
*  They range in age from 19 to 32 and face a maximum sentence of life in prison.
*  Also on Sunday, Russian authorities said that 137 bodies had been recovered from the charred
*  remains of the concert hall, including those of three children.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  In January, I underwent major abdominal surgery in London and at the time, it was thought
*  that my condition was non-cancerous.
*  The surgery was successful.
*  However, tests after the operation found cancer had been present.
*  In a video message on Friday, Catherine, Princess of Wales, disclosed that she'd been diagnosed
*  and has begun chemotherapy, ending weeks of fevered speculation about her absence from
*  British public life.
*  This of course came as a huge shock and William and I have been doing everything we can to
*  process and manage this privately.
*  In her message, Middleton did not say what kind of cancer she had or how far it had progressed
*  but emphasized that the diagnosis has required meaningful time to process.
*  It has taken me time to recover from major surgery in order to start my treatment.
*  But most importantly, it has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte
*  and Louis in a way that's appropriate for them and to reassure them that I'm going to be okay.
