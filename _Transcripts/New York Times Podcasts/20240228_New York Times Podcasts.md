# An Arms Race Quietly Unfolds in Space
**New York Times Podcasts:** [February 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0MFNvKTyBc)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, U.S. officials now acknowledge a growing fear that Russia may be trying to put a nuclear
*  weapon into Earth's orbit.
*  But as my colleague Eric Lipton explains, their real worry is that America could lose
*  the battle for military supremacy in space.
*  It's Wednesday, February 28th.
*  Eric, this story began in a pretty unusual way.
*  I actually watched it unfold on social media in real time, and it started with a very cryptic
*  message from a member of Congress.
*  So just tell us about that.
*  Sure.
*  Well, Representative Mike Turner, who's chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, put out
*  a message saying,
*  Today, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has made available to all
*  members of Congress information.
*  He had information concerning a serious national security threat.
*  And it was an unusual kind of a statement from the chairman of the House Intelligence
*  Committee.
*  He's requesting that President Biden declassify all information relating to this threat so
*  that Congress, the administration, and our allies...
*  And so he didn't really tell us what this was about, but he...
*  He just told us to be very scared.
*  Yes.
*  And it immediately set off a scramble of national security reporters to try to figure out what
*  that message meant.
*  And pretty quickly,
*  Congressman Turner is referring to a foreign military capability, and that foreign military
*  is the Russian military.
*  Reporters heard that this had to do with Russia and with a new type of military threat.
*  And what exactly was this new kind of military threat?
*  The intelligence that our New York Times colleagues have collected is that Russia is preparing
*  to put a weapon in space that would blow up a nuclear device.
*  And when it did that, it would be used to target United States surveillance satellites.
*  Okay.
*  So here, we need to slow down and explain what that means, why it's so alarming, why
*  nukes would ever be in space.
*  So just kind of disentangle all of that.
*  I think that few Americans realize just how vital space is to the military defense of
*  the United States.
*  For decades, the United States has been building effectively school bus-sized satellites that
*  cost massive amounts of money.
*  They're these exquisite systems that just sit there in space and provide incredible
*  information.
*  And we rely upon all of the assets that we have for navigation, for communication, for
*  missile defense, for missile targeting.
*  And it's something that is one of the great powers that the United States has to have
*  all of this equipment floating around above us.
*  The real flaw in the United States military space system is that there aren't very many
*  of them.
*  And you don't have to take out too many of them to severely disable the United States
*  capacities.
*  Got it.
*  So back to this Congressman Turner and his message.
*  Why would the Russians need a nuclear element to their efforts to challenge America's satellite
*  programs in space?
*  Russia sees potentially a nuclear weapon as a way to take out large numbers of satellites
*  in an instant.
*  Wow.
*  It would fry them.
*  It would destroy them.
*  It would create all kinds of debris in space.
*  And I think what's really going on here is the Russians in the early stages of their
*  invasion of Ukraine were really frustrated that they were not able to really block the
*  ability of the Ukrainian military to continue to communicate.
*  That's because the Ukrainian military was relying on SpaceX and Elon Musk and his network
*  of Starlink satellites to continue to operate.
*  And it was actually in late 2022 when the Russians said, you know what, those American
*  satellites are getting in our way and we may choose to target those satellites in the future.
*  And I think that's what might be going on right now.
*  Got it.
*  Russia has decided that a way for it to achieve any kind of military advantage over the U.S.
*  and have success in things like its invasion of Ukraine is to be able to threaten the United
*  States satellite infrastructure in space in such a way that might make it hard for the
*  U.S. to effectively fight back against Russia.
*  That's right.
*  Russia's been using what they call GPS jammers to disrupt the signals from satellites that
*  are coming down in Ukraine on the ground as they're fighting the war.
*  But everything from the location of the soldier on the ground to when there's a missile that's
*  launched that's targeted in the United States to how a ship communicates with another ship,
*  everything goes through space.
*  And I think that's one of the weakest points that the United States has.
*  And it's the ability to mess up or disable their space-based communications targeting
*  surveillance.
*  Hmm.
*  You're saying that when a rival like Russia thinks about how it could actually and efficiently
*  take out America's eyes and ears of our entire military, it turns out there's really only
*  one answer and that's by doing it in space.
*  Right.
*  It doesn't matter how big and powerful the weapons systems are.
*  If they can't target and they can't communicate, they're basically useless.
*  Okay.
*  So if you believe that Russia could put a nuclear weapon in space that could hurt our
*  ability to have eyes and ears on what they're doing, that would be very scary.
*  But how confident are we that Vladimir Putin can in fact put a nuclear weapon in space
*  that's capable of doing that?
*  Given that in fact there's already been nuclear tests in space in the 1960s, the idea of them
*  doing this is not out of the realm of technical possibilities.
*  It would be a violation of an international treaty, but Russia hasn't shown much concern
*  about violating international treaties.
*  So I don't think technically it would be that much of a challenge.
*  It would destabilize the world because suddenly you'd have nuclear weapons in space and it
*  would cross a line that so far no one has crossed.
*  But the notion, can it be done?
*  I think it could be done.
*  And I guess the question is not just can it be done, but how confident is the US that
*  Russia intends to do it and how quickly?
*  That's really unclear.
*  And I think that there's a lot of speculation even about exactly what this weapon might
*  be.
*  It could be a nuclear powered anti-satellite device that blows out satellites, but just
*  be nuclear powered.
*  It could be a nuclear weapon in space that explodes and blows out anything anywhere nearby.
*  We don't know when this potential Russian weapon is going to go up into orbit or whether
*  or not in fact it ever really will.
*  But what this does show a bit is that it's a bit of a Hail Mary by Russia, a way to try
*  to exert its influence in space at a moment when Russia is actually a declining power
*  relative to the other nations in the world.
*  Just explain that.
*  How can Russia be a declining power right now in space?
*  Russia is not launching nearly as frequently as it had been.
*  And its whole infrastructure around building new satellites is in decline, particularly
*  compared to China, which is launching at a crazy pace right now and putting up all kinds
*  of new commercial communication systems, but also devices that could become offensive weapons
*  against the United States.
*  So at the end of the day, when I talk to people at the Pentagon, despite the noise that Russia's
*  making about potentially putting a nuclear weapon in space, the biggest threat to United
*  States in space is actually China.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Eric, we started off talking about the threat that it seemed Russia posed to the
*  United States because of its willingness to potentially put a nuclear weapon in space.
*  Now you're saying that for the US military, the real threat in space is China.
*  So just explain that.
*  China as of at least the last decade, as part of a overall significant surge in its military
*  capacity, space has been an incredibly intense focus.
*  It has been launching at a really rapid pace, far ahead of Russia.
*  And it's not only putting communication satellites up there, but it's putting systems that could
*  potentially grab onto, move and disable American military satellites.
*  Well, how does that work?
*  How does something that they launch into space grab onto an American satellite?
*  Well, in January 2022, China put a satellite into space that had an arm that reached out
*  and grabbed another satellite that was there in geosynchronous orbit and it dragged it
*  to a different location.
*  So basically they found a way to put a tow truck up in space and showed that if they
*  wanted to, they can move any satellite.
*  That's right.
*  They showed that they had the ability to not only send satellites up there, but to send
*  trucks that had the capacity to grab onto maybe an enemy's surveillance system and basically
*  put it into a dead zone.
*  Another thing that China did was in 2007, this is quite a while ago, they launched the
*  missile up to about 530 miles, which is far into space, and they destroyed another satellite
*  that was in orbit and it created an incredible cloud of space debris, the largest amount
*  of space debris ever tracked.
*  And it was quite a worrisome thing for the United States to see that China has the capacity
*  to launch missiles from the ground that would destroy satellites and blow them up in low
*  Earth orbit.
*  Got it.
*  So both examples that you just described are much more targeted than what Russia is contemplating.
*  Moving one satellite or using a missile to take one out.
*  But the upshot is that China can disrupt our eyes and ears in space in a probably better,
*  more efficient way than Russia.
*  And you're saying given how much stuff they put up in space, they're more likely to already
*  be able to do it than Russia, which is still trying to get to that point.
*  Right.
*  The big difference between Russia and China right now is a space threat is that China
*  is moving rapidly on both offensive and defensive systems.
*  China is talking about building a state network of 13,000 satellites.
*  On a scale that's just completely outside of what Russia is attempting to do.
*  China is investing a lot more money and it's moving much faster right now to put new systems
*  in space and those systems are both going to threaten United States satellites and also
*  have a kind of a surveillance that would almost rival the United States.
*  So I want to understand where the US sits in all of this because when it comes to space,
*  it feels like the thing that would make the US military so anxious about a rival's advancements
*  in space is if we couldn't match them or we couldn't properly respond to them.
*  So what is the US readiness right now to basically match or fight back against whatever Russia
*  and China are doing in space?
*  Everyone I talked to from the Pentagon and also former Pentagon officials all agree that
*  the United States maintains clear dominance in space.
*  It has more satellites for surveillance and missile targeting and missile defense than
*  any other nation.
*  So both the United States and China have moved in a really rapid way into a new domain and
*  that is low Earth orbit.
*  That's about no greater than 1200 miles off the surface of the Earth and it's the area
*  where SpaceX has put more than 5000 satellites for its Starlink system.
*  That's the focus right now is the flood dead zone with lots of relatively cheap, quickly
*  manufactured, easy to replace satellite systems and the United States wants to put at least
*  1000 satellites into low Earth orbit for its military purposes in the next several years.
*  Among the many concerns that the American military has is that China is moving so rapidly
*  right now to build out its own system that unless the United States really accelerates
*  what it's doing that soon China could be close to matching what the US has in space and the
*  China now has enough surveillance capacity in space to target American military capacity
*  in any type of a conflict.
*  I mean imagine you know the scenario where China decides to invade Taiwan and the United
*  States decides that it's going to help defend Taiwan.
*  If all of our military assets are immediately visible to China they could be targeted even
*  before they got to the Taiwan Straits or even before they got within range to have a military
*  engagement and simultaneously China's offensive space weapons were disabling American satellites
*  so that the United States could no longer communicate.
*  That's the fear that the military has right now is both of those things could suddenly
*  happen if the United States is not building up its own space capacity and its space weapons
*  to disable Chinese satellites.
*  Guys so the worry and it's very specific is that if China can achieve the same level
*  of military prowess in space as the US then the US loses any power it has to deter China
*  from doing something like invade Taiwan because we know and they know that we know that they
*  can basically shut down our systems before and during that invasion and make it impossible
*  for us to stop them.
*  It would severely degrade military capacity if they could wipe out a good share of our
*  satellites and they're racing to try to avoid that.
*  So Eric what does it look like for the US to race to avoid China meeting America's capabilities
*  where they currently are.
*  I mean how does the US military do that.
*  Basically it would need to either slow China down or the US itself would need to speed
*  up and race ahead of China.
*  There's two primary things that are happening right now.
*  One is to build out US offensive systems to disable Chinese or Russian satellites.
*  So that includes jamming systems.
*  They just signed a new contract to build new devices that could jam Chinese or Russian
*  satellites and disrupt their signals.
*  User systems that could destroy satellites from the ground or from space and also other
*  systems that they just like the Chinese have built a tug in space.
*  The United States potentially is going to build its own systems that could grab and
*  disable other satellites in space.
*  The second piece of this plank is to build out a massive investment in space capacity
*  by the United States to build a whole new architecture in low Earth orbit with hundreds
*  if not more than a thousand satellites that will be so many so redundant that you couldn't
*  effectively disable the United States military capacity because even if you were to shoot
*  out a certain number of them there would be yet more of them.
*  Sort of like Starlink right now the SpaceX Starlink if it loses a certain number of its
*  5,800 satellites they just switch and they rebuild the network among the remaining satellites.
*  Actually everyone knows that the next time there's a major war with a major power that
*  there's going to be offensive activity in space and both sides are preparing for that.
*  Wow.
*  I mean what you're clearly describing is a new space race.
*  A space race that's about which of these three global superpowers can take out the others'
*  satellites and use their satellites offensively and defensively to achieve military supremacy.
*  Yeah that's right.
*  And I think that there's a new space race that's underway right now and it is more intense
*  than at any time since really the 1960s when the United States and Russia were testing
*  weapons in space for the first time.
*  And it is very intense and the increase in spending on space right now radically exceeds
*  anything that the Navy or the traditional Air Force or the Army is doing.
*  More dollars are pouring into space defense right now as a percentage increase.
*  It's more than any other part of the military.
*  Eric, this makes me wonder how much the US in its efforts to do those two things you
*  just described out in space is ultimately reliant on contractors, the private sector,
*  and in particular Elon Musk, right?
*  This guy who has put so many satellites up in the sky but who's mercurial and unique
*  to put it diplomatically.
*  So is the US plan for staying ahead of both Russia and China to ultimately put more and
*  more power in the hands of Elon Musk?
*  Right now there's no question that SpaceX and Elon Musk plays an extraordinarily dominant
*  role in the ability to launch to orbit and the military is excessively reliant on SpaceX.
*  So at this moment it's an uncomfortable domination by SpaceX.
*  Of the 9,400 objects in orbit right now, 5,235 of them are SpaceX Starlink satellites.
*  So almost all of the satellites in orbit that from any nation in the world are Elon Musk.
*  But the Department of Defense realizes that it can't be so reliant upon one company for
*  launch.
*  And so the Pentagon is also signing contracts with small launch companies to quickly be
*  able to put military satellites into space with just a few days notice.
*  And so there's a lot of money that's being spent to build out this capacity.
*  Right.
*  So what you're really saying is that this new space race is going to come with and foster
*  a new space military industrial complex that's going to be the recipient of many billions,
*  maybe trillions of dollars in taxpayer money.
*  That's right.
*  I mean, the United States is already in the middle of an incredible explosion in the commercial
*  space industry because the number of commercial launches is growing at a really crazy rate.
*  And in the entire world right now, there are approximately 10,000 objects in orbit.
*  And within the next 10 years, the expectation is going to be something like 25,000 satellites
*  in orbit.
*  So there's a huge boom right now in the space industry globally.
*  So Eric, when I step back, it feels like the inevitable outcome of this new space race,
*  weapons space race, is a very potentially expensive version of what we already have,
*  which is that famous concept of mutually assured destruction.
*  Right.
*  It's this idea that all three of these countries have nuclear weapons and it keeps us all in
*  check.
*  Russia, China, the US, we don't attack each other directly because we all fear that the
*  other country attacked would fire back in obliterating ways that would never make it
*  worth it.
*  And so isn't that kind of where we're headed with this battle over space?
*  All three countries are going to be spending a tremendous amount of money eventually to
*  reach some kind of loose parody that prevents us all from doing something really horrible
*  to the other country.
*  I mean, I sort of reject your premise.
*  And I think that in fact, the thing that the United States is concerned about is it has
*  had such a massive advantage in space for so long and it's been so central to our global
*  military supremacy.
*  And suddenly if you have another nation that's kind of walking in and becoming your rival
*  in that environment, I mean, that's really worrisome to the American military and they're
*  determined to prevent China from matching the United States military capacity in space.
*  You're saying this is not about the three countries ever achieving parody.
*  It's about the US ensuring that parody is never achieved because if it's achieved, then
*  everything changes.
*  Right.
*  I think that basically the Pentagon wants to ensure that it can maintain dominance in
*  space and not just parody because space-based dominance is so vital to the way that the
*  United States military has operated for years now.
*  Well, Eric, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to another day.
*  On Tuesday, President Biden summoned House and Senate leaders to the White House in an
*  attempt to avoid the latest potential government shutdown.
*  That shutdown, which could begin at midnight on Saturday, would be the result of strident
*  demands from House Republicans who have attached right-wing policies to basic spending bills
*  that have made them impossible to pass in the Senate.
*  We believe that we can get to agreement on these issues and prevent a government shutdown.
*  And that's our first responsibility.
*  As he left the White House, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed optimism that
*  a shutdown would be averted.
*  And we have been working in good faith around the clock every single day for months and
*  weeks and over the last several days, quite literally around the clock to get that job
*  done.
*  And in a rebuke to President Biden, more than 100,000 Democratic voters in Michigan cast
*  protest ballots that declared themselves uncommitted to express disapproval of the president's
*  handling of the war in Gaza.
*  That number far exceeded the goal of 10,000 uncommitted ballots that activists had set
*  for themselves and could spell trouble for Biden in the general election.
*  Michigan is a key swing state where Biden defeated Donald Trump in 2020.
