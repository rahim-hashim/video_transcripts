*  Hey, it's Michael.
*  Our politics show, The Runup, is back today with a new season.
*  And if you're wondering why we're relaunching a politics show a year and a half before
*  the presidential election, actually the host, my colleague, Aset Herndon, has a really good
*  answer for that.
*  To listen, search for The Runup, wherever you get your podcasts.
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro.
*  This is Adelaide.
*  Vice President Kamala Harris' trip last week to Africa was designed to send a simple
*  message to its governments and people.
*  China is not your friend.
*  We are.
*  Today, my colleague, Abtila Teef, to hear on why the United States is picking this moment
*  to make that case and what it has to lose if African countries choose China.
*  It's Thursday, April 6.
*  Abdi, tell us about this very high profile trip that the Vice President made last week
*  to Africa.
*  So this past week, Vice President Kamala Harris visited three different African countries.
*  That is Ghana, Tanzania and Zambia.
*  I am incredibly honored to be with you here in Ghana.
*  As soon as she stepped off the plane, she really got started on this charm offensive that
*  was meant to bring into the fall to woo the leaders and the people of the different nations
*  that she visited.
*  I am optimistic about the future of the world because of you.
*  The woman who will shatter every glass ceiling, the entrepreneur who will identify the next
*  digital breakthrough.
*  She talked about the continent's young people and the potential that they have in shaping
*  the future of the world.
*  And one of the ways that she showed that was by talking and meeting a lot of young people,
*  including artists.
*  I am very excited that this artist, this incredible artist, is going to be part of my playlist.
*  She even posted a Spotify list of her favorite African music and met with artists, including
*  one named Amr√©e.
*  I just can't thank you enough for the inspiration that you are providing.
*  I can't thank you enough.
*  You're so many people.
*  And perhaps the most notable stop on this trip was a really personal one that she did in Zambia.
*  It is wonderful to be in Zambia and to be back in Zambia.
*  She gave a speech talking about her family's ties to the country.
*  My grandfather was a civil servant in India.
*  And in 1966, shortly after Zambia's independence, he came to Lusaka.
*  Her grandfather worked there as a public servant for India.
*  And Vice President Kamala Harris would visit him as a child.
*  And I remember being here and in just how it felt and the warmth and the excitement that
*  was present.
*  But Kamala Harris' visit is just one in the latest string of top American officials who
*  have visited the continent this year.
*  Just over the past several months, we've had Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken.
*  We've had First Lady Jill Biden come through the Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.
*  And before that, we had the United States ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas Greenfield,
*  who also visited several African nations.
*  I have to say that's quite a line up.
*  I can't really remember the last time I heard a roster of diplomatic visits that deep
*  all in a span of just a few months.
*  I think the big elephant in the room is China and the feeling among American officials
*  and the Biden administration that the United States has ceded a lot of ground to China
*  when it comes to its engagement in Africa.
*  Explain that.
*  So over the past two decades, China has become the major trading partner for many countries
*  in the continent.
*  It is the largest fund of infrastructure projects in many African countries.
*  A lot of those African countries are also home to rare earth minerals, which the United
*  States and China both need in this big technological tussle that they are engaged in.
*  And China has already been digging a lot of those.
*  They've been processing and exporting them essentially, locking out the United States.
*  China has also been a major provider of educational scholarships to a lot of young African students.
*  And so I think there's a feeling within the United States that he is a young continent
*  that has the potential to shape geopolitics and wild economies in the decades to come.
*  And yet the United States has let China become the dominant force in those countries.
*  Got it.
*  Basically, the Biden administration realizes that in some sense, the future is Africa.
*  And China now owns that future.
*  Exactly.
*  How did we get to this place where the US has seeded so much ground in Africa to China?
*  So this begins around 1999, 2000, the time of the millennium.
*  And China came up with this policy that we call the going out policy.
*  And basically, a lot of it was about encouraging Chinese companies to go and invest
*  abroad.
*  And it was also an opportunity to bring a lot of the mineral resources that China needed,
*  which were abroad back home.
*  And we see the engagement between Africa and China quickly accelerate.
*  And then in 2013, China announced this incredibly ambitious project that ensured that it's
*  ties to the continent will be changed forever.
*  This program, which is called the Belt and Road Initiative, is an infrastructure project
*  that mirrors the Silk Road.
*  And it aims to stretch basically across the globe.
*  And it's coming in to Africa, particularly to build all these highways and ports and
*  railways that essentially will connect ports to the inland, you know, that would connect
*  cities to the rural areas.
*  We're talking about a total investment of hundreds of billions of dollars.
*  Wow.
*  And so, very quickly, as the money from the Belt and Road program floods into African
*  cities and African countries, what you start seeing is their visibility.
*  They're very direct.
*  They're in your face.
*  And very quickly, people are sort of like able to see and say, oh, yeah, this was actually
*  built for us by China.
*  China did this.
*  China did that.
*  And you quickly noticed how much China was changing cities across the continent.
*  So China is literally building Africa's infrastructure.
*  Absolutely.
*  You know, even in cities like Nairobi where I am based, particularly over the past decade,
*  the way this city has completely transformed is very much, you know, synonymous with China
*  and its arrival in the continent.
*  I used to, for instance, like study at a university on the other side of Nairobi and basically
*  the road that would go to that university was like a two-lane road.
*  And now it's one of the biggest highways in this region.
*  It's up to like eight different lanes.
*  And so whenever you think about how the traffic in Nairobi was so bad in the past and how
*  all these highways and expressways that are opening up across the city, everybody just
*  thinks about China.
*  Everybody just thinks, oh, yeah, it used to take me these many hours to get to one place.
*  But thank God for China.
*  And I'll be where was the United States during all of this as China is making these enormous
*  investments that are clearly creating a tremendous amount of influence for it across Africa.
*  The US has always been there.
*  I think we shouldn't discount the fact that the United States is still the continent's
*  largest aid donor, right?
*  And the fact that, you know, they continue to be very pivotal in providing emergency food
*  investments in healthcare.
*  But I think in many ways over the past two to three decades, the US has treated Africa
*  less as a strategic partner and more as a problem to be solved.
*  And the focus particularly has shifted towards dealing with a continent through a terrorism
*  and a security lens.
*  Explain that.
*  So for instance, you have the example of like countries like Somalia where there's been
*  an ongoing civil war for decades and then the arrival of the terrorist group of Shabab
*  and all the troubles that they've caused in this region and beyond.
*  And so the relationship that the United States has with neighboring countries, including
*  Kenya or Ethiopia or Djibouti is all about like how do we partner up to sort of like tackle
*  this?
*  How do we make sure that the militaries in this region are professionalized?
*  How do we help law enforcement build up intelligence infrastructure that would deny Shabab
*  haven in the region?
*  Got.
*  So the US has focused on building an infrastructure to fight terrorism, not on the kind of infrastructure
*  projects that China is focused on, which is the kind of bread and butter bridges, airports
*  and dams that so many of these countries need.
*  Exactly.
*  And these countries they do need the security support that would sort of like deter a lot
*  of these terrorist groups.
*  But on a day-to-day basis, these big infrastructure projects that China is bringing, they're loved.
*  They become these symbols, right?
*  That a lot of people look at and appreciate.
*  And that's sort of like the conversation that you hear, reverberating in many places
*  across the continent.
*  So presumably the United States has recognized what you're describing here for some time
*  that China has been to put it undiplomatically eating America's lunch in Africa.
*  So when does the US decide that this is a problem that it has to do something about by dispatching
*  all these top American officials, including Vice President Harris?
*  So the real wake-up call comes after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
*  And during that time, like, you know, the United States rallied countries across the world
*  at the United Nations General Assembly to basically condemn the war.
*  And a courted war has been requested.
*  We shall now begin the war in process.
*  And China, of course, did not condemn the war.
*  They did not vote for the resolution.
*  Those in favour of draft resolution please signify those against abstentions.
*  But also...
*  The result of the war is as follows.
*  In favour, 41 against five abstentions, 35.
*  Nearly half of African countries abstained all were absent from the vote to condemn Russia.
*  Interesting.
*  Which suggested a growing reluctance in many nations to accept an American narrative of
*  what's right and what's wrong.
*  Because in this moment, it feels like African countries are in a sense choosing more of a Chinese
*  narrative of this Russian war in Ukraine than the American narrative of the Russian war in Ukraine.
*  Exactly.
*  And, you know, a lot of African countries or the leadership in those countries were basically
*  putting out statements or lines of thinking that said that, you know, this is not our war.
*  And this is not our problem.
*  And we are going to continue trading with China.
*  We're going to continue trading with Russia as the Ugandan president, Euromisevini said,
*  you know, we don't believe in being enemies of somebody else's enemy.
*  And so it becomes very clear that whatever influence that the United States had in the continent
*  had quickly been ceded to a lot of other countries, including mainly China.
*  So not long after this, it's only been about a year we have Vice President Harris
*  hopscotching across Africa, not exactly a one-to-one cause and effect, but clearly the
*  US was spooked by what you just described and started to act.
*  But what makes the United States, what makes the Biden administration think that they can
*  now ever catch up after essentially 20 years of losing ground to China?
*  So after 20 years, the relationship between China and Africa as much as it's been beneficial
*  and deepening, it's also coming under extreme scrutiny.
*  It's coming under scrutiny from public officials, from young people in those countries, from
*  rights groups, and one country where this is all playing out and where the United States
*  feels that it can compete with China, claw back some influence, is the country where Vice
*  President Kamala Harris ended her trip.
*  And that is Zambia.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Abdi, what has China's relationship with Zambia looked like and how has it created
*  what the United States now sees as an opportunity to regain ground in Africa?
*  Zambia is one of the largest producers in the world for copper and one of the largest
*  producers of cobalt in Africa, which as we know is used in batteries and electrical vehicles,
*  something that both the United States and China want.
*  And as China's engagement in the continent through other 2000s picked up, one of the things
*  that Zambia did was that it turned to China in order to borrow and pay for the huge infrastructure
*  projects that they wanted at the time.
*  And the Chinese come into the country, they build dums, railway, airports, hospitals,
*  so there are all these projects that are being planned.
*  Zambia is facing tough questions over its foreign debt levels.
*  And the debts quickly start to pile up.
*  From investors who think the real numbers may be more than double, but the government has
*  discused.
*  Soon enough, they spiral out of control and even at one point reaching more than 100% of
*  the country's economy.
*  Wow.
*  The International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday that corruption had inflated the cost
*  of numerous high profile projects in Zambia.
*  And there are all these reports around corruption with illicit finance that come out hundreds
*  of millions of dollars taken out of some of these projects.
*  Do we have the figures in the Chinese minds?
*  We don't have any figures in the mining industry.
*  It's crazy.
*  And the fact that China is involved in all of this and how that was impacting the economy,
*  inflation rates are going up.
*  They are destroying our generation.
*  Where are we going to be?
*  Where are children going to be?
*  A lot of young people in the country because of this debt crisis are jobless.
*  The government wherever you are, take this opportunity to listen to us, the Zambia.
*  They are disgruntled and not happy.
*  And around that time, you know, like the International Monetary Fund starts getting
*  worried that the country is at high risk of debt distress.
*  And even as this disgruntlement goes on, we hit a pivotal moment in 2020.
*  Zambia is inadvertently making history for all the wrong reasons.
*  As it becomes the first Samp-Saharan country to default.
*  And Zambia became the first African country to default on its debt due to the coronavirus
*  pandemic.
*  And what ends up being the fallout from that default?
*  The fallout from that is that that happens literally a year to a major election because
*  of the other disgruntlement across the country what President Edgar Lungo starts doing is that
*  these are an increasingly brutal crackdown in human rights.
*  We see opposition leaders, journalists, activists all being targeted.
*  The president, his rival, Hakainda Hitchilema, reigned on this platform that he will end
*  corruption, that he will restore the rule of law, that he will fix the economy.
*  So Zambia's one change.
*  I mean, it's written on the walls.
*  Change is written in the air.
*  And young people across the country come out in droves to actually vote for him.
*  We all want to see things in truth.
*  That is why we're braving this sun at everything else to come and stand in the cues to vote.
*  I love Hitchilema because he's an economist.
*  I think he's going to bring development to this country and he wins.
*  Hitchilema Hakainda S to be president-elect of the Republic of Zambia.
*  This is 16th day of August 2021.
*  And that when shows that there is this deep fission in the relationship that China had
*  worked so hard to build a nurture and the United States now sees an opportunity there that
*  they are able to like step in.
*  And it feels important that unlike over the past 20 years when China is associated with many
*  good things, you know, a new bridge, a new dam, a new airport here in Zambia, China becomes
*  associated with something quite bad, which is corruption and a government that the people have
*  rejected.
*  Exactly.
*  And Western leaders have increasingly voiced fears about China's intentions in Africa and
*  said that they were predatory largely because they think that this model of like giving so
*  much money and loans to African country is meant to be exploiting them so that when the debt
*  continues to grow and these countries are not able to pay, China would willingly take oil
*  or any other minerals in payment.
*  They will continue to do trade in those countries.
*  That's why like there's a lot of concern particularly coming from the United States and
*  directed to his China Africa relations where they say this model is not working and Zambia
*  is an example of that.
*  So given everything you have just described, that's happened in Zambia at the hands of this
*  aggressive Chinese involvement.
*  How does the U.S., how does Vice President Harris think about the U.S. upper tuner there
*  as a result?
*  So Vice President Kamala Harris announces a raft of programs in Zambia which are more or
*  less like a lot of the things that the United States had already been doing in Zambia.
*  These include agreements or commitments related to trade and economic transformation, investments
*  in health such as fighting malaria and HIV AIDS.
*  But I think what was really different this time round was that Harris calling out basically
*  China and saying that China needs to come to the table to be able to restructure Zambian
*  debt and she basically used her podium in Zambia to point to the reality of what was happening
*  in Zambia as a question to the tail and saying that America is a better partner than China
*  for Zambia.
*  And that is no doubt the message that Vice President Harris is trying to project over the entire
*  continent, right?
*  I mean, she might be visiting three countries, but the message that is emerging from each
*  is China is not really your friend.
*  China brings problems.
*  We are a better alternative.
*  But the question still remains, is it possible for the U.S. to successfully persuade these
*  governments that the U.S. is a viable alternative when China has become so intimately bound up
*  in the lives, the airports and the streets of these countries over the past 20 years?
*  Yeah.
*  So the United States, because of the relationship it has with a lot of these countries, you
*  know, might be able to convince some of them or make some inroads at some point along
*  the way.
*  But I think the way China and its political, economic dominance has spread across the continent
*  is something that will be very hard to rectify quite quickly.
*  American officials landing in a lot of these African countries are landing in airports that
*  were expanded, either fully or partly with Chinese money.
*  They are getting into meetings in buildings where China has built and sometimes even has
*  the China flag, you know, thanking China for building the building.
*  Right.
*  So that's very hard and it will take what I think is consistent engagement with these countries
*  over several different administrations, prioritizing Africa and engagement with Africa at
*  multiple levels before they're able to sort of like come to par with what China and China's
*  place in the continent looks like now.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  I'm curious if you are in African country right now and I'm sure in your reporting you
*  are speaking to the leaders of these countries, does this competition from these two superpowers,
*  China and the US for investment and for attention and influence, is this a welcome development?
*  I mean, does this empower these governments because perhaps they can now play the US and
*  China off of each other or is this just the latest chapter in a very long and familiar
*  story of large outside countries trying to exploit these African countries?
*  And how are these African leaders seeing this moment?
*  I think African leaders are seeing this moment as an opportunity for them to showcase and
*  to say what they mean at the global stage, particularly when you have multiple powers
*  interested in their resources, interested in the trade and the consumption that their young
*  people will be able to do, interested in seeing wanting and craving even like their support
*  when it comes to global issues including like the war in Ukraine or human rights issues.
*  So it's a shifting moment in the continent where we are seeing African leaders publicly
*  push out their policies to both the superpowers at the same time.
*  For instance, like, you know, the Zambian president, he's firmly and publicly actually talked
*  about how he's willing to work with the United States as much as he's willing to work with
*  China.
*  Which is very interesting and it may mean that these African countries, they could become
*  the very rare and perhaps enviable examples of nations in the world that will not allow
*  themselves to be overly influenced by just China or just the US.
*  In some ways, they will demand that both countries play a role in their lives, but that one
*  not have necessarily the upper hand.
*  And perhaps that could spare them some of the exploitation that we have come to expect
*  from these relationships.
*  Yes.
*  Well, one of the words that I continue to hear from African leaders that I speak to
*  is the word agency.
*  You know, these African leaders, they talk a lot about agency.
*  They talk a lot about being allowed to like trade with China and like work on health
*  and development with the United States.
*  There is this sense of like, why should we pick a side?
*  This is a largely developing continent.
*  There are different partners who are able to come in and solve different issues.
*  We will welcome them all.
*  As one official put it to me, he said that, you know, China will come and build the hardware
*  and the United States will come and build the software.
*  And both of those will complement each other and then benefit the people of the country.
*  And they are not naive.
*  They know that the relationship they have with one side or the other will be fraught and
*  complicated and complex.
*  But for now, where they stand, they sense an opportunity and they want to take that opportunity.
*  Well, Abdi, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate that.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  In a surprise defection with major implications, a democratic state lawmaker in North Carolina
*  has switched parties and given Republicans veto-proof supermajorities in both chambers
*  of its legislature.
*  The lawmaker, Trisha Kotham, said she was leaving the Democratic Party over policy disagreements.
*  Because she said she had been bullied by fellow Democrats for failing to fall in line with
*  North Carolina's Democratic governor, Roy Cooper.
*  It became very clear to me early on in January that you better vote in line with everything
*  that her Cooper tells you to do.
*  All of this sense of control, I will not be controlled by anyone.
*  Her defection may now allow North Carolina Republicans to, among other things, restrict
*  abortion and voting rights across the state.
*  And on Wednesday, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy stepped into the growing feud between the United
*  States and China over Taiwan by meeting with Taiwan's president in California.
*  McCarthy became America's most senior elected official to meet with a Taiwanese president
*  on American soil since the United States established diplomatic relations with China in 1978.
*  China argues that such meetings undermine its claims of control over Taiwan.
