# America Has a Problem in Africa: China
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq3Bcy0CisE)
*  Hey, it's Michael. Our politics show, The Run-Up, is back today with a new season. And
*  if you're wondering why we're relaunching a politics show a year and a half before the
*  presidential election, actually, the host, my colleague, Astead Herndon, has a really
*  good answer for that. To listen, search for The Run-Up wherever you get your podcasts.
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro. This is a daily.
*  Vice President Kamala Harris' trip last week to Africa was designed to send a simple message
*  to its governments and people. China is not your friend. We are.
*  Today, my colleague, Abdi Latif Dahir, on why the United States is picking this moment
*  to make that case and what it has to lose if African countries choose China.
*  It's Thursday, April 6th.
*  She tell us about this very high profile trip that the vice president made last week
*  to Africa.
*  So this past week, Vice President Kamala Harris visited three different African countries.
*  That is Ghana, Tanzania and Zambia.
*  As soon as she stepped off the plane, she really got started on this charm offensive
*  that was meant to bring into the fold to woo the leaders and the people of the different
*  nations that she visited.
*  I am optimistic about the future of the world because of you. The woman who will shatter
*  every glass ceiling, the entrepreneur who will identify the next digital breakthrough.
*  She talked about the continent's young people and the potential that they have in shaping
*  the future of the world. And one of the ways that she showed that was by talking and meeting
*  a lot of young people, including artists.
*  I am very excited that this artist, this incredible artist is going to be part of my playlist.
*  She even posted a Spotify list of her favorite African music and met with artists, including
*  one named Amre.
*  I just can't thank you enough for the inspiration that you are providing.
*  Please, I can't thank you enough.
*  So many people.
*  And perhaps the most notable stop on this trip was a really personal one that she did
*  in Zambia.
*  It is wonderful to be in Zambia and to be back in Zambia.
*  She gave a speech talking about her family's ties to the country.
*  My grandfather was a civil servant in India. And in 1966, shortly after Zambia's independence,
*  he came to Lusaka.
*  Her grandfather worked there as a public servant for India.
*  And Vice President Kamala Harris would visit him as a child.
*  I remember being here and just how it felt and the warmth and the excitement that was present.
*  Hmm.
*  But Kamala Harris's visit is just one in the latest string of top American officials who
*  have visited the continent this year.
*  Just over the past several months, we've had Secretary of State Antony Blinken, we've
*  had First Lady Jill Biden come through, the Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.
*  And before that, we had the United States Ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield,
*  who also visited several African nations.
*  I have to say, that's quite a lineup.
*  I can't really remember the last time I heard a roster of diplomatic visits that deep, all
*  in a span of just a few months.
*  I think the big elephant in the room is China and the feeling among American officials and
*  the Biden administration that the United States has ceded a lot of ground to China when it
*  comes to its engagement in Africa.
*  Explain that.
*  So over the past two decades, China has become the major trading partner for many countries
*  in the continent.
*  It is the largest fund of infrastructure projects in many African countries.
*  A lot of those African countries are also home to rare earth minerals, which the United
*  States and China both need in this big technological tussle that they are engaged in.
*  And China has already been digging a lot of those.
*  They've been processing and exporting them, essentially locking out the United States.
*  China has also been a major provider of educational scholarships to a lot of young African students.
*  And so I think there's a feeling within the United States that here's a young continent
*  that has the potential to shape geopolitics and wild economies in the decades to come.
*  And yet the United States has let China become the dominant force in those countries.
*  Got it.
*  So basically, the Biden administration realizes that in some sense, the future is Africa and
*  China now owns that future.
*  Exactly.
*  Abdi, how did we get to this place where the U.S. has ceded so much ground in Africa to
*  China?
*  So this begins around 1999 or 2000, the time of the millennium.
*  China came up with this policy called the Going Out Policy.
*  And basically, a lot of it was about encouraging Chinese companies to go and invest abroad.
*  And it was also an opportunity to bring a lot of the mineral resources that China needed,
*  which were abroad, back home.
*  And we see the engagement between Africa and China quickly accelerate.
*  And then in 2013, China announced this incredibly ambitious project that ensured that its ties
*  to the continent will be changed forever.
*  This program, which is called the Belt and Road Initiative, is an infrastructural project
*  that mirrors the Silk Road and it aims to stretch basically across the globe.
*  And it's coming in to Africa, particularly, to build all these highways and ports and
*  railways that essentially will connect ports to the inland, that would connect cities to
*  the rural areas.
*  We're talking about a total investment of hundreds of billions of dollars.
*  And so very quickly, as the money from the Belt and Road program floods into African
*  cities and African countries, what you start seeing is their visibility.
*  They're very direct.
*  They're in your face.
*  And very quickly, people are sort of like able to see and say, oh, yeah, this was actually
*  built for us by China.
*  China did this.
*  China did that.
*  And you quickly noticed how much China was changing cities across the continent.
*  So China is literally building Africa's infrastructure.
*  Absolutely.
*  You know, even in cities like Nairobi, where I am based, particularly over the past decade,
*  the way this city has completely transformed is very much synonymous with China and its
*  arrival in the continent.
*  I used to, for instance, like study at a university on the other side of Nairobi.
*  And basically, the road that would go to that university was like a two-lane road.
*  And now it's one of the biggest highways in this region.
*  It's up to like eight different lanes.
*  Wow.
*  And so whenever you think about how the traffic in Nairobi was so bad in the past and how
*  there are all these highways and expressways that are opening up all across the city,
*  everybody just thinks about China.
*  Everybody just thinks, oh, yeah, it used to take me this many hours to get to one place.
*  Thank God for China.
*  And Abhi, where was the United States during all of this, as China is making these enormous
*  investments that are clearly creating a tremendous amount of influence for it across Africa?
*  The US has always been there.
*  I think we shouldn't discount the fact that the United States is still the continent's
*  largest aid donor.
*  Right.
*  And the fact that they continue to be very pivotal in providing emergency food investments
*  in health care.
*  But I think in many ways over the past two to three decades, the US has treated Africa
*  less as a strategic partner and more as a problem to be solved.
*  And the focus particularly has shifted towards dealing with the continent through a terrorism
*  and a security lens.
*  Explain that.
*  So for instance, you have the example of countries like Somalia, where there's been an
*  ongoing civil war for decades and then the arrival of the terrorist group of Shabab and
*  all the troubles that they've caused in this region and beyond.
*  And so the relationship that the United States has with neighboring countries, including
*  Kenya or Ethiopia or Djibouti, is all about how do we partner up to sort of tackle this?
*  How do we make sure that the militaries in this region are professionalized?
*  How do we help law enforcement build up intelligence infrastructure that would deny Al-Shabab
*  haven in the region?
*  Got it. So the US is focused on building an infrastructure to fight terrorism, not on
*  the kind of infrastructure projects that China is focused on, which is the kind of bread
*  and butter bridges, airports and dams that so many of these countries need.
*  Exactly. And these countries, they do need the security support that would sort of deter
*  a lot of these terrorist groups.
*  But on a day to day basis, these big infrastructure projects that China is bringing, they're
*  loved. They become these symbols that a lot of people look at and appreciate.
*  And that's sort of like the conversation that you hear reverberating in many places
*  across the continent.
*  So presumably the United States has recognized what you're describing here for some time,
*  that China has been, to put it undiplomatically, eating America's lunch in Africa.
*  So when does the US decide that this is a problem that it has to do something about
*  by dispatching all these top American officials, including Vice President Harris?
*  So the real wake up call comes after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
*  And during that time, like, you know, the United States rallied countries across the
*  world at the United Nations General Assembly to basically condemn the war.
*  A recorded vote has been requested.
*  We shall now begin the voting process.
*  And China, of course, did not condemn the war.
*  They did not vote for the resolution.
*  Those in favor of draft resolution, please signify those against abstentions.
*  But also the result of the vote is as follows in favor 41 against five abstentions, 35.
*  Nearly half of African countries abstained or were absent from the vote to condemn
*  Russia.
*  Interesting.
*  Which suggested a growing reluctance in many nations to accept an American
*  narrative of what's right and what's wrong.
*  Right. Because in this moment, it feels like African countries are, in a sense,
*  choosing more of a Chinese narrative of this Russian war in Ukraine than the
*  American narrative of the Russian war in Ukraine.
*  Exactly. And, you know, a lot of African countries or the leadership in those
*  countries were basically putting out statements or lines of thinking that said
*  that, you know, this is not our war and this is not our problem.
*  And we are going to continue trading with China.
*  We're going to continue trading with Russia.
*  As the Ugandan president, Yurma Seviny said, you know, we don't believe in being
*  enemies of somebody else's enemy.
*  And so it becomes very clear that whatever influence that the United States had in
*  the continent had quickly been ceded to a lot of other countries, including mainly
*  China.
*  So not long after this, it's only been about a year.
*  We have Vice President Harris hopscotching across Africa.
*  Not exactly a one-to-one cause and effect, but clearly the U.S.
*  was spooked by what you just described and started to act.
*  But what makes the United States, what makes the Biden administration think that they
*  can now ever catch up after essentially 20 years of losing ground to China?
*  So after 20 years, the relationship between China and Africa, as much as it's been
*  beneficial and deepening, it's also coming under extreme scrutiny.
*  It's coming under scrutiny from public officials, from young people in those countries,
*  from rights groups.
*  And one country where this is all playing out and where the United States feels that
*  it can compete with China, claw back some influence, is the country where Vice President
*  Kamala Harris ended her trip.
*  And that is Zambia.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Abdi, what has China's relationship with Zambia looked like and how has it created
*  what the United States now sees as an opportunity to regain ground in Africa?
*  Zambia is one of the largest producers in the world for copper and one of the largest
*  producers of cobalt in Africa, which, as we know, is used in batteries and electrical
*  vehicles, something that both the United States and China want.
*  And as China's engagement in the continent throughout the 2000s picked up, one of the
*  things that Zambia did was that it turned to China in order to borrow and pay for the
*  huge infrastructure projects that they wanted at the time.
*  And the Chinese come into the country.
*  They build dams, railway, airports, hospitals.
*  So all these projects that are being planned.
*  Zambia is facing tough questions over its foreign debt levels.
*  And the debts quickly start to pile up.
*  From investors who think the real numbers may be more than double, what the government
*  has disclosed.
*  Soon enough, they spiral out of control and even at one point reaching more than 100
*  percent of the country's economy.
*  Wow.
*  The International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday that corruption had inflated the cost of
*  numerous high profile projects in Zambia.
*  And there are all these reports around corruption with illicit finance that come out,
*  hundreds of millions of dollars taken out of some of these projects.
*  Do we have the figures in the Chinese mines?
*  Do we know that?
*  We don't have any figures in the mining industry.
*  It's crazy.
*  And the fact that, you know, China is involved in all of this and how that was impacting
*  the economy. Inflation rates are going up.
*  They are destroying our generation.
*  Where are we going to be?
*  Where are children going to be?
*  A lot of young people in the country, because of like, you know, this debt crisis, are
*  jobless.
*  Government, wherever you are, take this opportunity to listen to us, the Zambias.
*  They're disgruntled, they're not happy.
*  And around that time, you know, like the International Monetary Fund starts getting
*  worried that the country is at high risk of debt distress.
*  And even as this disgruntlement goes on, we hit a pivotal moment in 2020.
*  Zambia is inadvertently making history for all the wrong reasons as it becomes the first
*  sub-Saharan country to default.
*  When Zambia became the first African country to default on its debt during the
*  coronavirus pandemic.
*  And what ends up being the fallout from that default?
*  The fallout from that is that that happens literally a year to a major election because
*  of all the disgruntlement across the country.
*  What President Ed Galungu starts doing is that there's an increasingly brutal crackdown
*  on human rights.
*  We see opposition leaders, journalists, activists all being targeted.
*  The president, his rival, Hakeinde Hichilema, reign on this platform that he will end
*  corruption, that he will restore the rule of law, that he will fix the economy.
*  So Zambia is one change.
*  I mean, it's written on the walls, change is written in the air.
*  And young people across the country come out in droves to actually vote for him.
*  We all want to see things improve.
*  That is why we're braving this sun and everything else to come and stand in the
*  queue to vote.
*  I love HH because he's an economist.
*  Okay, I think he's going to bring development to this country.
*  And he wins.
*  Hichilema Hakeinde is to be president-elect of the Republic of Zambia.
*  This is 16th day of August 2021.
*  And that win shows that there is this deep fissure in the relationship that China had
*  worked so hard to build and nurture.
*  And the United States now sees an opportunity there that they are able to like step in.
*  Right.
*  And it feels important that unlike over the past 20 years, when China is associated
*  with many good things, you know, a new bridge, a new dam, a new airport here,
*  in Zambia, China becomes associated with something quite bad, which is corruption and
*  a government that the people have rejected.
*  Exactly.
*  And Western leaders have increasingly voiced fears about China's intentions in Africa
*  and said that they were predatory largely because they think that this model of like
*  giving so much money and loans to African country is meant to be exploiting them so
*  that when the debt continues to grow and these countries are not able to pay, China
*  would willingly take oil or any other minerals in payment.
*  They will continue to do trade in those countries.
*  That's why like there's a lot of concern, particularly coming from the United States
*  and directed towards China-Africa relations, where they say this model is not working.
*  And Zambia is an example of that.
*  So given everything you have just described that's happened in Zambia at the hands of
*  this aggressive Chinese involvement, how does the U.S., how does Vice President Harris
*  think about the U.S.
*  opportunity there as a result?
*  So Vice President Kamala Harris announces a raft of programs in Zambia, which are more
*  or less like a lot of the things that the United States had already been doing in Zambia.
*  These include agreements or commitments related to trade and economic transformation,
*  investments in health, such as fighting malaria and HIV AIDS.
*  But I think what was really different this time around was that Harris calling out
*  basically China and saying that China needs to come to the table to be able to restructure
*  Zambian debt.
*  And she basically used her podium in Zambia to point to the reality of what was happening
*  in Zambia as a question of detail and saying that America is a better partner than China
*  for Zambia.
*  And that is no doubt the message that Vice President Harris is trying to project over
*  the entire continent, right?
*  I mean, she might be visiting three countries, but the message that is emerging from each
*  is China is not really your friend.
*  China brings problems.
*  We are a better alternative.
*  But the question still remains.
*  Is it possible for the US to successfully persuade these governments that the US is
*  a viable alternative when China has become so intimately bound up in the lives, the
*  airports and the streets of these countries over the past 20 years?
*  Yeah, so the United States, because of the relationship it has with a lot of these
*  countries, might be able to convince some of them or make some inroads at some point
*  along the way.
*  But I think the way China and its political, economic dominance has spread across the
*  continent is something that will be very hard to rectify quite quickly.
*  American officials landing in a lot of these African countries are landing in airports
*  that were expanded either fully or partly with Chinese money.
*  They are getting into meetings in buildings where China has built and sometimes even has
*  the China flag, thanking China for building the building.
*  So that's very hard.
*  And it will take what I think is consistent engagement with these countries over several
*  different administrations, prioritizing Africa and engagement with Africa at multiple
*  levels before they're able to sort of like come to power with what China and China's
*  place in the continent looks like now.
*  I'm curious if you are an African country right now, and I'm sure in your reporting
*  you are speaking to the leaders of these countries.
*  Does this competition from these two superpowers, China and the US, for investment and
*  for attention and influence, is this a welcome development?
*  I mean, does this empower these governments because perhaps they can now play the US and
*  China off of each other?
*  Or is this just the latest chapter in a very long and familiar story of large outside
*  countries trying to exploit these African countries?
*  And how are these African leaders seeing this moment?
*  I think African leaders are seeing this moment as an opportunity for them to showcase and
*  to say what they mean at the global stage, particularly when you have multiple powers
*  interested in their resources, interested in the trade and the consumption that their
*  young people will be able to do, interested in seeing wanting and craving even like
*  their support when it comes to global issues, including like the war in Ukraine or
*  human rights issues.
*  So it's a shifting moment in the continent where we're seeing African leaders publicly
*  push out their policies to both these superpowers at the same time.
*  For instance, like, you know, the Zambian president, he's firmly and publicly actually
*  talked about how he's willing to work with the United States as much as he's willing
*  to work with China.
*  Which is very interesting.
*  And it may mean that these African countries, they could become the very rare and perhaps
*  enviable examples of nations in the world that will not allow themselves to be overly
*  influenced by just China or just the U.S.
*  In some ways, they will demand that both countries play a role in their lives, but that one
*  not have necessarily the upper hand.
*  And perhaps that could spare them some of the exploitation that we have come to expect
*  from these relationships.
*  Yes.
*  One of the words that I continue to hear from African leaders that I speak to is the word
*  agency.
*  You know, these African leaders, they talk a lot about agency.
*  They talk a lot about being allowed to like trade with China and like work on health and
*  development with the United States.
*  And there is this sense of like, why should we pick a side?
*  This is a largely developing continent.
*  There are different partners who are able to come in and solve different issues.
*  We will welcome them all.
*  As one official put it to me, he said that, you know, China will come and build the
*  hardware and the United States will come and build the software.
*  And both of those will complement each other and then benefit the people of the country.
*  And they are not naive.
*  They know that the relationship they have with one side or the other will be fraught
*  and complicated and complex.
*  But for now, where they stand, they sense an opportunity and they want to take that
*  opportunity.
*  Well, Abdi, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  In a surprise defection with major implications, a Democratic state lawmaker in North
*  Carolina has switched parties and given Republicans veto proof supermajorities in
*  both chambers of its legislature.
*  Modern day Democratic Party has become unrecognizable to me and to so many others
*  throughout this state and this country.
*  The lawmaker, Tricia Cotham, said she was leaving the Democratic Party over policy
*  disagreements and because she said she had been bullied by fellow Democrats for failing
*  to fall in line with North Carolina's Democratic governor, Roy Cooper.
*  It became very clear to me early on in January that you better vote in line with everything
*  Governor Cooper tells you to do.
*  All of this sense of control.
*  I will not be controlled by anyone.
*  Her defection may now allow North Carolina Republicans to, among other things, restrict
*  abortion and voting rights across the state.
*  And on Wednesday, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy stepped into the growing feud between the
*  United States and China over Taiwan by meeting with Taiwan's president in California.
*  McCarthy became America's most senior elected official to meet with a Taiwanese president
*  on American soil since the United States established diplomatic relations with China in
*  1978.
*  China argues that such meetings undermine its claims of control over Taiwan.
