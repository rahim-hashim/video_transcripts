*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverny-Sea, and this is the Daily.
*  A devastating fire in Johannesburg last week is raising troubling questions about chaos
*  and dysfunction in Africa's richest city.
*  Today, my colleague, Lindsay Choutel, on how the city that was once a symbol of the hope
*  of post-aportite South Africa is now an emblem of just how bad the breakdown has become.
*  It's Friday, September 8th.
*  So, Lindsay, tell me about the fire you've been reporting on in Johannesburg,
*  which as it turns out, is the deadliest residential fire in South African history.
*  The last Thursday at about one o'clock in the morning,
*  smoke began to rise from the downtown building, and by the time I woke up,
*  massive blows in the Johannesburg CBD this morning, it is a very quickly developing story that
*  was all over the news. The firefighters rushed to the five-story building,
*  now they are still searching through the building for more victims.
*  And the death target surprising hour by hour, when I first turned on the TV,
*  it was about 20 people, then it was 40 people, then it was 60 people,
*  and then by the end of the day, it was 77 people, and I rushed on to the side,
*  and the bodies were laid out in the street.
*  You can literally see that the bodies have been covered with metal sheeting,
*  with blankets.
*  People who had run out of the building were sitting there in shock on the sidewalk,
*  and it was just a scene of such devastation.
*  This is the building itself, you can see that it's burned from the back,
*  it's burned from the front, and up here you can see some of the residents
*  who were desperately trying to get out, had left a mattress there,
*  and were jumping from the top floors.
*  Even though the fire had been brutal under control by the morning,
*  by the time the sun came up,
*  the whistle smoke coming from the building, and there were just crowds and crowds of people,
*  and what we realised is that these weren't onlookers,
*  these were people who lived inside this building.
*  So up to about 600 people, possibly even more,
*  just standing there, the entire lives just in ruin and in ambence quite frankly.
*  And as someone who's from Johannesburg,
*  how did you understand what had happened, what did it look like to you?
*  It felt horribly inevitable.
*  So we have had a series of disasters in Johannesburg,
*  and we've kind of just quickly moved on from them.
*  For example, a few weeks ago, a street quite literally exploded in downtown Johannesburg,
*  cars flew up into the air, and thank goodness there were very few fatalities.
*  And you would think that seeing a giant crack on a main road would shock people,
*  but it didn't.
*  By day two, people had to turn to their homes, they carried on, they cordoned off the road,
*  and that tells you something about what Johannesburg is as a city.
*  In the last few years, you've seen Johannesburg slowly decaying,
*  becoming worse and worse every day.
*  And for those of us particularly South Africans,
*  what we're wondering is if the economic capital of the most prosperous part of the country,
*  which is one of the most advanced economies in Africa,
*  if you can't keep that city running, what does the rest of this country look like,
*  and what is the hope for the rest of the country quite frankly?
*  Okay, so let's talk about that.
*  How did Johannesburg get here? Walk me through it, bring me back to those hopeful early days.
*  So Johannesburg is a relatively young city.
*  It was when Golda discovered here in 1886 that everybody rushed here,
*  and everybody from Eastern Europe all the way to China came to find their lives here
*  and to make their fortunes here.
*  It was an incredibly diverse city, but ironically it's also where apartheid began.
*  That is the system of segregation with black and white and all races were kept separately.
*  And this is where Nelson Mandela, the iconic freedom fighter began this fight against apartheid,
*  and this is with the sight of so much violence and political struggle and pain.
*  It is my great pleasure to announce the president of the Republic of South Africa,
*  Mr. Nelson, Kolyshata Mandela.
*  Then came 1994.
*  Out of the experience, upon an extraordinary human disaster,
*  that lost a too low,
*  mass deporned society,
*  of which all humanity will be found.
*  The apartheid ends as South Africa becomes a democracy,
*  and Johannesburg sits at the center of that crown jewel of what South Africa could be.
*  Neighborhoods are integrating schools, integrating,
*  and for better or for worse,
*  shopping malls are popping up all over during the early 90s, late 2000s.
*  They've got glass ceilings and cinemas.
*  A big Mac has made it to South Africa.
*  And there's a McDonald's.
*  Hamburg a giant is planning to open another restaurant this month than 15 more next year.
*  And in downtown Johannesburg at this time,
*  even though white businesses and white families fled the inner city, feared in crime,
*  they were replaced with migrants who came from all over the continent,
*  from as far as Nigeria, Ethiopia,
*  Mozambique, Zimbabwe,
*  where all come bringing their hopes to Johannesburg.
*  And so it becomes this multicultural, diverse economic powerhouse
*  that just draws people from everywhere.
*  And that in 2010,
*  the decision was taken after only one round of open.
*  FIFA announces a virtual 2010 FIFA World Cup
*  will be organized in South Africa.
*  The first African World Cup will be held in South Africa.
*  It's the 19 people, it's everything is freedom, it's everything I just love it.
*  And it's a real sense of optimism,
*  because the stadiums are going up, the hotels are going up.
*  Very well done to South Africa.
*  I've never thought they could do it, but they did it man, they did it.
*  I feel it for them.
*  And it's this beautiful moment of what South Africa could be.
*  We feel safe on the trains and coming here.
*  It's a good vibe at the moment, hopefully it can carry on after that.
*  But beyond the World Cup, things began to fall apart.
*  And that's where the disappointment begins to sit in.
*  So walk me through that, what changed?
*  So at this point, the party of Nelson Mandela,
*  the African National Congress, is still in power.
*  But we're beginning to see a different side of that party.
*  This party that had these grand visions of South Africa
*  becomes myad in corruption scandals from top to bottom,
*  from the presidency all the way down to your local street counsellor.
*  But what that means is that the money that should have been spent on building schools,
*  on paying for university tuition, on building hospitals has disappeared.
*  Unemployment is rising, there's an economic crisis that is growing.
*  And it turns into the sense of desperation that also drives violent crime in the city.
*  And perhaps the most material way South Africans are feeling it,
*  is that we literally find ourselves in the dark.
*  Around about 2012, 2013, rolling blackouts become worse and worse.
*  And South Africans learn to live with the fact that the country's unable to supply electricity,
*  and that it's just one of the many things that was unable to supply.
*  And by 2019, particularly here in Johannesburg,
*  there was a backlash against the African National Congress,
*  when the voters decided that they would not keep the ANC in power and voted them out.
*  And what happened when they were voted out? Like, what did that mean for Johannesburg?
*  Well, what that meant was political chaos.
*  So smaller parties suddenly became kingmakers,
*  parties that many South African voters had never even heard of,
*  they were at the bottom of the ballot,
*  and suddenly they became the swing vote.
*  And these parties were unable to form coalition governments,
*  but those coalition governments were so rickety that Johannesburg has had six mayors
*  in the last two years alone.
*  Wow. A mayor for each season.
*  Precisely. I bid you, if you asked any job worker who the mayor is,
*  they're not quite sure themselves.
*  And so at this point, what that means is,
*  who do you call when you're in trouble?
*  Who do you call when services aren't working?
*  A couple of weeks ago, the copper cables on my street were stolen.
*  Copper cables have become a great underground business,
*  and the people rip out the copper wiring and sold off a scrap metal.
*  And that means that in your street,
*  you will not have electricity in my case for up to a week.
*  Wait, the copper cable in your street was stolen?
*  Like from city power lines?
*  From city power lines.
*  So what happens is because we have these rolling blackouts,
*  there is no electricity running through the copper cables,
*  and that is the perfect time to rip them out of the ground,
*  to rip them out of power stations,
*  and to sell them cut scrap metal.
*  And it's not just the copper theft.
*  It is the trash collection,
*  and the heaps of trash that are piling up around the city.
*  There are these huge, crater-sized hot holes,
*  and terrifyingly in a city with high crime,
*  the street lines don't work in so many neighborhoods.
*  And that's what led me to start reporting on the decay of Johannesburg,
*  and just exactly what was happening.
*  And back in May, my colleague, Joao Silver,
*  the photographer and I, actually in up at 80 Albert Street,
*  which is the building that is now burnt and become the center of such an awful tragedy.
*  And what I found was hijacked building.
*  Okay, what exactly is a hijacked building?
*  Like I think of a plane or a car when you use the word hijacked.
*  And that's nearly exactly what it is.
*  So what happens is that you have a building that is seen as vulnerable,
*  a building where the landlord is missing,
*  where it's clear that there are no,
*  there's nobody taking care of this building.
*  And so what you'll find is that groups of criminals,
*  or groups of gangs sometimes,
*  will walk into a building
*  and start taking over rooms.
*  And they'll take over room.
*  There's a wheel of here now.
*  And the people who do love there,
*  or people who want to move in,
*  they start collecting rent.
*  So the landlord is completely kicked out.
*  And people, criminals, will collect rent for these buildings,
*  in which there is often no running water, no electricity,
*  no fire escapes, no trash collection.
*  And the worst part is that there are dozens of them around the city.
*  So it's almost as if these people, the hijackers,
*  are kind of taking the building hostage, right?
*  Like they have seized it,
*  and they're extracting rent from people.
*  Precisely.
*  You can quite literally steal a building
*  and have it function as a residential building
*  without any oversight from the city
*  and without any response from the city.
*  Wow, that is wild.
*  That is wild.
*  And what happens is that a fit of the building
*  that has been hijacked,
*  is that it affects the entire block.
*  And so the people who are living inside,
*  because there's a mix of people, right?
*  But the easiest is for criminals to move into these buildings.
*  And so people walking past these buildings,
*  who often be mugged, they will be shot.
*  But there are also people who can't afford to love anywhere else.
*  And so they're living in these conditions as well.
*  So it's a mix of the exploitation of Johannesburg's working poor,
*  those people who came to Jobord,
*  who tried and build a life
*  and found that they can't even afford accommodation.
*  And how many of these buildings are there in Johannesburg?
*  The number itself varies.
*  The highest estimate is that it could be as many as 600.
*  But that includes empty lots and houses,
*  because just as you can steal a building,
*  you can also quite literally steal someone's house.
*  So what was this building like inside when you went in May?
*  So I will be completely honest.
*  I didn't go quite inside.
*  Oh no.
*  So the people living across the road warned us
*  that we would absolutely be robbed
*  if we went near this building.
*  And so we watched people going in and out
*  and we saw this heap of trash right at the entrance.
*  We saw another heap of trash
*  and the other side of the building sagging on the ease.
*  The windows were broken.
*  It was pitch dark.
*  It was the middle of the day,
*  but it was pitch dark inside the building,
*  because there was no light.
*  And there were rats scaring around.
*  And of course, my colleague, Joao Solva,
*  who is a well-known war photographer.
*  Indeed.
*  Went back the next day,
*  because he was determined to take a look inside.
*  And he got only as far as the lobby.
*  If my colleague, Joao Solva,
*  only went as far as the lobby,
*  Joao Solva is one of the most fearless people.
*  I know we were together in Afghanistan.
*  It must have been pretty bad.
*  It was a case of he didn't know who was behind which door.
*  And that's where the threat would be.
*  So Joao walks around the lobby
*  and he sees exposed wire.
*  He sees doors hanging off the hinges.
*  And he just remarked over and over
*  just how dark and unsafe the building itself was.
*  But in the aftermath of the fire,
*  we've gotten the closest sense of what happened behind those closed doors,
*  which we were all wasn't able to go,
*  talking to the survivors,
*  people who lived inside this building,
*  and how they feared for their lives,
*  and how even they saw that this was an inevitability.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Lindsay, you finally find out what it's like to live in this building
*  because you've talked to some of the people who lived there.
*  What did they say?
*  Actually, it's like a dream.
*  So the morning after the fire,
*  I go to a community center nearby
*  that is housing many of the survivors.
*  And in one of the halls,
*  women have been sleeping on donated mattresses with blankets.
*  Can I come closer?
*  Yes.
*  And on one of those rolled up mattresses,
*  I find a young woman and her mother.
*  Her mother's name is Pearl.
*  She's in her early fifties.
*  And she's like me and my own.
*  Just us.
*  And next to her is her daughter.
*  The building we used to live at,
*  is another hijack one.
*  They had just moved from one hijack building
*  where it had become too unsafe for them
*  because of the criminality in that building,
*  into this building here.
*  And how long were you living in the building?
*  It's the third building.
*  They'd been there for a couple months,
*  but they said that life was hell.
*  It was bad, it was bad to have hit the bike.
*  Sometimes during the night,
*  we'd have to wake up and lie in our stomach
*  because they were gunshots, right in the patsy?
*  It was bad, it was bad.
*  Sometimes at night, we'd hear ghosts screaming.
*  And you guys were playing the big stuff.
*  Yes, that's the worst part.
*  They shared a room that was designed
*  for just two women on single beds.
*  They were about four women in that room.
*  They pay more than a thousand rand
*  for this little corner of a room,
*  which is about $50 just over.
*  And they get this money from Pearl,
*  who cleans the streets,
*  and from her daughters tuition fee
*  that she gets from the state as a college student.
*  They had no running water,
*  and so would use water from the fire hydrant
*  or collect water from an open drain.
*  Whenever you had to pee or leave yourself,
*  you had to go like four feet away
*  and go to cut, is it?
*  They had no toilets,
*  and so they would walk up to the shopping mall,
*  two to three blocks up the road during the day,
*  and at night when it became too unsafe,
*  they would relieve themselves in buckets
*  and keep it in the room.
*  I had to be at home by 5.
*  The luggage is not dark yet.
*  The daughter could not get into the building after dark,
*  not because she was afraid of what was happening outside.
*  And we have people who love you inside the building.
*  But because of inside the building,
*  she would rush home and lock herself in the room before sunset.
*  Because the day I had no electricity,
*  I was using wood inside the apartment list.
*  The only way to keep the room warm
*  is to make a small fire in the room,
*  and they knew this was a fire hazard,
*  and it was an awful choice that they had to make every day.
*  They knew that this building was going to be life-threatening.
*  And how did they describe the night of the fire?
*  So on the night of the fire,
*  the daughter had been studying late,
*  and it was too unsafe to go home,
*  so she stayed with a friend,
*  and she was just her mum at home,
*  and her mum, Paul, says,
*  roundabout after 1 a.m.
*  She'd gotten up and she wanted to relieve herself.
*  Then I had decided that time was great.
*  And she says quite frankly,
*  there's something felt off.
*  So there was a sense of foreboding,
*  and she began to pray.
*  Then after I prayed,
*  when I was about to go back to sleep in my bed,
*  I had something like a cell of a gun outside.
*  And what she remembers there after is suddenly,
*  she heard screaming,
*  saying, the shirt has been,
*  the shirt has been,
*  and people were banging on the doors,
*  and said, there's a fire, there's a fire in the building.
*  And what it seemed is that,
*  in one of the shacks on the ground floor,
*  or in the lot outside,
*  there seems to have been a fire.
*  And of course, we don't know exactly what the cause is just yet,
*  but we do know that that fire spread rapidly
*  because of the materials within this abandoned stripped building.
*  Then I just took my clothes,
*  I took it a bit,
*  then I walked out,
*  I locked it in the bed like eight hours playing in my heart,
*  they've got just protect me,
*  just show me the way.
*  Paul says she got out of her room,
*  but she locked the door because she's hoping
*  that she's able to come back at some point.
*  And she grabs what she can.
*  She says she didn't have time to grab her door to schoolbooks,
*  and she runs outside,
*  and as she's running, she takes the risk of running down the stairs.
*  We know a lot of people who are too afraid as the fire leapt up,
*  and they jumped out of the third floor.
*  Paul is one of the lucky ones that made it down the stairs,
*  but she says on one of the floors, there was a locked door.
*  Some people are screaming, they crying.
*  And she heard banging and banging,
*  and she says it was sound that she will never forget
*  of a man screaming on the other side of a locked door,
*  and she had to make that choice.
*  She should go and try and free him.
*  I never thought of myself.
*  I had to save myself, but I know that I have a childhood dream.
*  If I die, she'll be left alone.
*  I thought it was right in my mind that
*  you know what you cannot die in this fire.
*  You have to save yourself for this child.
*  It's the choice of,
*  does she save herself for her daughter,
*  who she loves for?
*  Or does she run and try and save this man,
*  who she doesn't know because of the truth,
*  that she doesn't really know her neighbors.
*  People, when I spoke to them outside, they said,
*  we didn't really know who we were living next door to,
*  because people were in and out.
*  There were no ones when their clothes were running for our lives.
*  We didn't know how far they'd say fire,
*  and what is going to happen, maybe their built-in was going to explode.
*  We just ran out.
*  She makes the choice,
*  and she runs in the opposite direction
*  from the man that we're screaming.
*  And when she finally makes it out into the street,
*  she looks back at the building as a flame.
*  So I was sitting there,
*  some of the people thrown themselves from the roof,
*  second floor,
*  third floor,
*  people are dying in front of us.
*  And people are jumping,
*  and some of them are falling to their deaths,
*  and as she's saying this,
*  she shakes her head and tears,
*  it's just filling her eyes.
*  But her daughter,
*  she's hardening herself at this point.
*  She says that quite frankly,
*  she just wants to move on from 80 Albert Street.
*  I feel like all these people I believed
*  that what happened happened because
*  they were looking for my way out.
*  You're looking at them and they're free,
*  and they're relieved,
*  they're down inside,
*  because it was hell.
*  She doesn't want to have that memory.
*  You said that people clearly knew
*  that a fire like this was possible,
*  that these hijack buildings,
*  you know, are a phenomenon,
*  and that there are over 600 of them,
*  you called this inevitable in some ways.
*  So who's at fault here?
*  You know, when I got to the scene,
*  I asked the mayor of that same question.
*  I said,
*  people have been calling you about this building
*  for years to my records,
*  at least since May.
*  So who is at fault here?
*  And he said,
*  while his administration is new,
*  everyone is at fault.
*  And that is a catch-all,
*  because that means that no one person
*  will be held accountable here.
*  Because what this building represents
*  is a series of failures within the city,
*  and a series of failures within the country quite frankly.
*  So my colleague John Illigo found a trove of documents
*  that showed emails between
*  city and environmental officials sending emails
*  to people in the health department,
*  their colleagues in public safety,
*  their colleagues in the Johannesburg property company,
*  which was the state-owned entity
*  that ran this company.
*  And they said,
*  we have had inspections here,
*  at least from 2017,
*  they listed all the problems with the building,
*  and they said that this is a bad building.
*  It is turning into an emergency situation
*  and we should do something about it.
*  What we did not find is what exactly people did about it.
*  Residents who live across the road,
*  those are the people that I interviewed back in May already,
*  said that they had also called the police.
*  They called the police when they heard screams.
*  They called the police when they thought there was a murder,
*  when they saw a woman being thrown off the third or fourth floor.
*  And the police would come,
*  they would be a raid,
*  but then laugh at the truth and it would just go right back
*  to the way things were.
*  And so there are all these failures at every step,
*  and when city officials were doing this sort of tour
*  around the disaster,
*  giving police conferences,
*  giving police briefings,
*  blaming each other,
*  I asked one of the city officials,
*  when was the last time you were inside this building?
*  When was the last time there was an inspection?
*  And he said to me,
*  it was in 2019,
*  because we couldn't risk going into a hostile environment.
*  A hostile environment where people lived.
*  So stepping back for a minute here, Lindsay,
*  you know, going back to something we talked about at the beginning
*  of our conversation,
*  Johannesburg as the symbol of hope and optimism
*  that really all of us had about South Africa back in 1994.
*  And now,
*  here we have this.
*  And I mean, you know,
*  I don't want to read too much into it.
*  We just had our own disastrous fire in the state of Hawaii.
*  But it does seem safe to say
*  that this fire has shown Johannesburg
*  to be a symbol of something else.
*  What would you say it is?
*  I think Johannesburg at this point is
*  a symbol of the disappointment
*  of what South Africa could have been.
*  Johannesburg has all these precincts in which the city tried to
*  bold and create
*  and make it safe and livable.
*  But even as I was driving here,
*  I would see a developed building
*  and next door was a hijack building.
*  Every time there is one step forward,
*  there are two to three steps back.
*  And to be sure,
*  there are great gleaming stretches of the city
*  that still show the old promise.
*  But more and more for so many people,
*  the city just doesn't hold the promise that it used to.
*  Lindsay, as someone from Johannesburg,
*  whose life has spanned this period,
*  how do you see it?
*  You know, I grew up between a part of Soweto
*  and Johannesburg suburbs.
*  I was bused into school back and forth every day.
*  I've traveled from one end of Johannesburg
*  and what I've loved about the city
*  is its innovation, its diversity,
*  its sense of energy.
*  And what I am finding is that
*  the spirit of the city is slowly waning and struggling.
*  The city is struggling to rise above this political disaster.
*  It's struggling to rise above decades of neglect.
*  And it's struggling to rise above
*  what is becoming a national problem in South Africa,
*  where it seems as if there is no clear path forward.
*  And it seems as if the people who have been interested
*  in steering the city
*  and steering the country into this future
*  that everybody dreamed about in 1994
*  are unable to do it.
*  And so, for the people that I have been talking to,
*  what they're seeing this is, is a leaderless city.
*  And that question is important because
*  we are months away from a pivotal election.
*  Next year is not only the 30-year anniversary
*  of democracy in South Africa.
*  It's also an election year,
*  where some pundits are saying that they believe
*  that the ANC will go to its lowest margin yet.
*  It will still win.
*  But what we're seeing then is that likely
*  that it will be at its weakest.
*  And so, what we're questioning then is,
*  who steps into that gap?
*  And what I think is that the lesson here
*  is rather than relying on a political party
*  to step into that gap,
*  what I have seen in the days after the fire
*  is South Africans and immigrant communities
*  coming together to try and help each other,
*  to feed each other, to find homes
*  for each other, to help each other,
*  for the beauty they did.
*  And so, what I hope is that South Africans
*  will find the humanity in what has truly been
*  an absolute tragedy.
*  And I hope that unlike the previous times
*  that Johannesburg doesn't just move on from this one.
*  Lindsay, thank you.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Thursday.
*  Let me tell you something, New Yorkers.
*  Never in my life have I had a problem.
*  That I did not see an Indian too.
*  I don't see an Indian too.
*  New York Mayor Eric Adams escalated his rhetoric
*  over the influx of migrants to the city,
*  claiming in stark terms that the crisis was existential.
*  This issue will destroy New York City.
*  Adams, a Democrat in his second year in office,
*  has clashed with leading members of his party
*  as New York City has struggled to provide housing
*  and services to the migrants who now number 110,000.
*  For months he has criticized President Biden
*  and New York's governor, Kathy Hoekle,
*  for failing to help the city.
*  But his comments on Thursday were the most ominous yet,
*  and drew praise from Republicans and condemnation
*  from some Democrats.
*  And Peter Navarro, a trade adviser
*  to former President Donald Trump,
*  was convicted on Thursday of criminal contempt of Congress
*  over his defiance of a subpoena
*  from the House Committee investigating the January 6th attack
*  on the Capitol.
*  The verdict in federal district court in Manhattan
*  made Mr. Navarro the second top adviser of Trump's
*  to be found guilty of contempt for defying the committee's inquiry.
*  Stephen Bannon, a former strategist for Mr. Trump,
*  was convicted of the same offense last summer.
