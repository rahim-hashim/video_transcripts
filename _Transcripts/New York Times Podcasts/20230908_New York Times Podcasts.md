# A Tragic Fire and Broken Promises in South Africa
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jih4J2H9GEc)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  A devastating fire in Johannesburg last week is raising troubling questions about chaos
*  and dysfunction in Africa's richest city.
*  Today, my colleague, Lindsay Chutel, on how the city that was once a symbol of the hope
*  of post-apartheid South Africa is now an emblem of just how bad the breakdown has become.
*  It's Friday, September 8th.
*  So, Lindsay, tell me about the fire you've been reporting on in Johannesburg, which,
*  as it turns out, is the deadliest residential fire in South African history.
*  So, last Thursday, at about 1 o'clock in the morning, smoke began to rise from the downtown
*  building.
*  And by the time I woke up—
*  Massive blaze in the Johannesburg CBD this morning.
*  It is a very quickly developing story that—
*  It was all over the news.
*  People rushed to the five-story building.
*  Now, they are still searching through the building for more victims.
*  And the death toll kept rising hour by hour.
*  When I first turned on the TV, it was about 20 people.
*  Then it was 40 people.
*  Then it was 60 people.
*  And then by the end of the day, it was 77 people.
*  And I'd rushed down to the site, and the bodies were laid out in the street.
*  You can literally see that the bodies have been covered with metal sheeting, with blankets.
*  People who had run out of the building were sitting there in shock on the sidewalk.
*  And it was just a scene of such devastation.
*  This is the building itself.
*  You can see that it's burned from the back.
*  It's burned from the front.
*  And up here, you can see some of the residents who were desperately trying to get out had
*  left a mattress there and were jumping from the top floors.
*  Even though the fire had been brought under control by the morning, by the time the sun
*  came up, there was still smoke coming from the building.
*  And there were just crowds and crowds of people.
*  And what we realized is that these weren't onlookers.
*  These were people who lived inside this building.
*  So up to about 600 people, possibly even more, just standing there their entire lives just
*  in ruin and in embers, quite frankly.
*  And as someone who's from Johannesburg, how did you understand what had happened?
*  What did it look like to you?
*  It felt horribly inevitable.
*  So we have had a series of disasters in Johannesburg.
*  And we've kind of just quickly moved on from them.
*  For example, a few weeks ago, a street quite literally exploded in downtown Johannesburg.
*  Cars flew up into the air and thank goodness, there were very few fatalities.
*  And you would think that seeing a giant crack on a main road would shock people, but it didn't.
*  By day two, people had to turn to their homes.
*  They carried on.
*  They cordoned off the road.
*  And that tells you something about what Johannesburg is as a city.
*  In the last few years, we've seen Johannesburg slowly decaying, becoming worse and worse
*  every day.
*  And for those of us, particularly South Africans, what we're wondering is if the economic capital
*  of the most prosperous part of the country, which is one of the most advanced economies
*  in Africa, if you can't keep that city running, what does the rest of this country look like?
*  And what is the hope for the rest of the country, quite frankly?
*  OK, so let's talk about that.
*  How did Johannesburg get here?
*  Walk me through it.
*  Bring me back to those hopeful early days.
*  So Johannesburg is a relatively young city.
*  It was when gold was discovered here in 1886 that everybody rushed here and everybody from
*  Eastern Europe all the way to China came to find their lives here and to make their fortunes
*  here.
*  It was an incredibly diverse city, but ironically, it's also where apartheid began.
*  That is the system of segregation where black and white and all races were kept separately.
*  And this is where Nelson Mandela, the iconic freedom fighter, began this fight against
*  apartheid.
*  And this is with the sight of so much violence and political struggle and pain.
*  It is my great pleasure to announce the president of the Republic of South Africa, Mr Nelson
*  Khoili-Lalla Mandela.
*  Then came 1994.
*  Out of the experience of an extraordinary human disaster that lasted too long must be
*  borne a society of which all humanity will be proud.
*  Apartheid ends and South Africa becomes a democracy.
*  And Johannesburg sits at the centre of that.
*  It's the crown jewel of what South Africa could be.
*  Neighbourhoods are integrating, schools are integrating and for better or for worse, shopping
*  malls are popping up all over during the early 90s, late 2000s.
*  They've got glass ceilings and cinemas.
*  The Big Mac has made it to South Africa.
*  And there's a McDonald's.
*  The hamburger giant is planning to open another restaurant this month and 15 more next year.
*  And in downtown Johannesburg at this time, even though white businesses and white families
*  fled the inner city, feared in crime, they were replaced with migrants who came from
*  all over the continent, from as far as Nigeria, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, would all
*  come bringing their hopes to Johannesburg.
*  And so it becomes this multicultural, diverse economic powerhouse that just draws people
*  from everywhere.
*  And then in 2010.
*  The decision was taken after only one round of voting.
*  FIFA announces that
*  The 2010 FIFA World Cup will be organised in South Africa.
*  The first African World Cup will be held in South Africa.
*  It's uniting people, it's everything, it's freedom, it's everything, I just love it.
*  Everything is a real sense of optimism, because here stadiums are going up, hotels are going
*  up.
*  Very well done to South Africa.
*  I never thought they could do it, but they did it, man, they did it.
*  And it's this beautiful moment of what South Africa could be.
*  We feel safe on the trains and coming here.
*  It's a good vibe at the moment.
*  Hopefully it can carry on after that.
*  But beyond the World Cup, things began to fall apart.
*  And that's where the disappointment begins to set in.
*  So walk me through that.
*  What changed?
*  So at this point, the party of Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress, is still in
*  power.
*  But we're beginning to see a different side of that party.
*  This party that had these grand visions for South Africa becomes mired in corruption scandals
*  from top to bottom, from the presidency all the way down to your local street councillor.
*  But what that means is that the money that should have been spent on building schools,
*  on paying for university tuition, on building hospitals has disappeared.
*  Unemployment is rising, there's an economic crisis that is growing, and it turns into
*  the sense of desperation that also drives violent crime in the city.
*  And perhaps the most material ways that Africans are feeling it is that we literally find ourselves
*  in the dark.
*  Around about 2012, 2013, rolling blackouts become worse and worse.
*  And South Africans learn to live with the fact that the country is unable to supply
*  electricity.
*  And that is just one of the many things that was unable to supply.
*  And by 2019, particularly here in Johannesburg, there was a backlash against the African National
*  Congress when voters said that they would not keep the ANC in power and voted them out.
*  And what happened when they were voted out?
*  Like, what did that mean for Johannesburg?
*  Well, what that meant was political chaos.
*  So smaller parties suddenly became kingmakers, parties that many South African voters had
*  never even heard of.
*  They were at the bottom of the ballot.
*  And suddenly, they became the swing vote.
*  And these parties were then able to form coalition governments.
*  But those coalition governments were so rickety that Johannesburg has had six mayors in the
*  last two years alone.
*  Wow, a mayor for each season.
*  Precisely.
*  I bet you if you asked any JoBurger who the mayor is, they're not quite sure themselves.
*  And so at this point, what that means is, who do you call when you're in trouble?
*  Who do you call when services aren't working?
*  Couple weeks ago, the copper cables on my street were stolen.
*  Copper cables have become a great underground business.
*  And so people rip out the copper wiring and it's sold as scrap metal.
*  And that means that in your street, you will not have electricity, in my case, for up to
*  a week.
*  Wait, the copper cable in your street was stolen?
*  Like from city power lines?
*  From city power lines.
*  So what happens is because we have these rolling blackouts, there is no electricity
*  running through the copper cables.
*  And that is the perfect time to rip them out of the ground, to rip them out of power stations
*  and to sell them scrap metal.
*  And it's not just the copper theft.
*  It is the trash collection and the heaps of trash that are piling up around the city.
*  There are these huge crater sized potholes.
*  And terrifyingly in a city with high crime, the streetlights don't work in so many neighborhoods.
*  And that's what led me to start reporting on the decay of Johannesburg and just exactly
*  what was happening.
*  And back in May, my colleague, Joelle Silver, the photographer and I actually end up at
*  80 Albert Street, which is the building that is now burned and become the center of such
*  an awful tragedy.
*  And what I found was a hijacked building.
*  Okay.
*  What exactly is a hijacked building?
*  Like I think of a plane or a car when you use the word hijack.
*  And that's nearly exactly what it is.
*  So what happens is, is that you have a building that is seen as vulnerable, a building where
*  the landlord is missing, where it's clear that there's nobody taking care of this building.
*  And so what you'll find is that groups of criminals or groups of gangs sometimes will
*  walk into a building and start taking over rooms.
*  And they'll take over a room, they'll say, we live here now.
*  And under the threat of violence, the people who do live there or people who want to move
*  they start collecting rent.
*  So the landlord is completely kicked out and people, criminals will collect rent for these
*  buildings in which there is often no running water, no electricity, no fire escapes, no
*  trash collection.
*  And the worst part is that there are dozens of them around the city.
*  So it's almost as if these people, the hijackers are kind of taking the building hostage, right?
*  Like they have seized it and they're extracting rent from people.
*  Precisely.
*  You can quite literally steal a building and have it function as a residential building
*  without any oversight from the city and without any response from the city.
*  Wow, that is wild.
*  That is wild.
*  And it is what happens is that effect of the building that has been hijacked is that it
*  affects the entire block.
*  And so the people who are living inside, because it's a mix of people, right?
*  But the easiest is for criminals to move into these buildings.
*  And so people walking past these buildings will often be mugged, they will be shot.
*  But there are also people who can't afford to live anywhere else.
*  And so they're living in these conditions as well.
*  So it's a mix of the exploitation of Johannesburg's working poor, those people who came to Joburg
*  to try and build a life and find that they can't even afford accommodation.
*  And how many of these buildings are there in Johannesburg?
*  The number itself varies.
*  The highest estimate is that it could be as many as 600.
*  But that includes empty lots and houses, because just as you can steal a building, you can
*  also quite literally steal someone's house.
*  So what was this building like inside when you went in May?
*  So I will be completely honest, I didn't go quite inside.
*  Oh, no.
*  I so the people living across the road warned us that we would absolutely be robbed if we
*  went near this building.
*  And so we watched people going in and out and we saw this heap of trash right at the
*  entrance.
*  We saw another heap of trash on the other side of the building sagging on the ease.
*  The windows were broken.
*  It was pitch dark.
*  It was the middle of the day, but it was pitch dark inside the building because there was
*  no light.
*  And there were rats scurrying around.
*  And of course, my colleague, Joao Silva, who is a well-known war photographer, went back
*  the next day because he was determined to take a look inside.
*  And he got only as far as the lobby.
*  If my colleague, Joao Silva, only went as far as the lobby, Joao Silva is one of the
*  most fearless people I know.
*  We were together in Afghanistan.
*  It must have been pretty bad.
*  It was a case of he didn't know who was behind which door.
*  And that's where the threat would be.
*  Yeah.
*  So Joao walks around the lobby and he sees exposed wire.
*  He sees doors hanging off the hinges.
*  And he just remarked over and over just how dark and unsafe the building itself was.
*  But in the aftermath of the fire, we've gotten a closer sense of what happened behind those
*  closed doors where Joao wasn't able to go talking to the survivors, people who lived
*  inside this building, and how they feared for their lives and how even they saw that
*  this was an inevitability.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Lindsay, you finally find out what it's like to live in this building because you've
*  talked to some of the people who live there.
*  What did they say?
*  I'm sleeping.
*  I'm sleeping.
*  I'm sleeping.
*  So the morning after the fire, I go to a community center nearby that is housing many of the
*  survivors.
*  And in one of the halls, women have been sleeping on donated mattresses with blankets.
*  Can I come in also?
*  Yes.
*  And on one of those rolled up mattresses, I find a young woman and her mother.
*  Her mother's name is Pearl.
*  She's in her early 50s.
*  It's like me and my mom.
*  Just us.
*  And next to her is her daughter.
*  The building we used to live at then is another hijacked one.
*  They had just moved from one hijacked building where it had become too unsafe for them because
*  of the criminality in that building into this building here.
*  And how long were you living in the building?
*  Since the third month.
*  They'd been there for a couple months, but they said that life was hell.
*  Here goes screaming.
*  And you guys were paying with interest?
*  Yes.
*  That's the worst part.
*  They shared a room that was designed for just two women on single beds.
*  There were about four women in that room.
*  They pay more than a thousand rand for this little corner of a room, which is about $50
*  just over.
*  And they get this money from Pearl, who cleans the streets, and from her daughter's tuition
*  fee that she gets from the state as a college student.
*  They had no running water and so would use water from the fire hydrant or collect water
*  from an open drain.
*  Whenever you had to pee or relieve yourself, you had to go like four feet away, go to the
*  cancer center.
*  They had no toilets, and so they would walk up to the shopping mall two to three blocks
*  up the road during the day.
*  And at night, when it became too unsafe, they would relieve themselves in buckets and keep
*  it in the room.
*  I had to be at home by five, as long as it's not dark yet.
*  The daughter could not get into the building after dark, not because she was afraid of
*  what was happening outside.
*  You'd have people rob you inside the building.
*  But because of inside the building.
*  She would rush home and lock herself in the room before sunset.
*  Because of that, I had no electricity.
*  I was using wood inside the apartment.
*  Yes.
*  The only way to keep the room warm is to make a small fire in the room.
*  And they knew this was a fire hazard, and it was an awful choice that they had to make
*  every day.
*  So they knew that this building was going to be life-threatening.
*  And how did they describe the night of the fire?
*  So on the night of the fire, the daughter had been studying late and it was too unsafe
*  to go home.
*  So she stayed with a friend.
*  And it was just her mum at home.
*  And her mum, Pearl, says round about after 1 a.m., she'd gotten up and she wanted to
*  relieve herself.
*  Ten past one.
*  Then I have decided that I must pray.
*  And she says, quite frankly, that something felt off.
*  So there was a sense of foreboding, and she began to pray.
*  Then after I prayed, when I was about to go back to sleep in my bed, I heard something
*  like the sound of a gun outside.
*  And what she remembers thereafter is suddenly she heard screaming.
*  Saying, the shelter is burning, the shelter is burning.
*  And people were banging on the doors and saying, there's a fire, there's a fire in the building.
*  And what it seemed is that in one of the shacks on the ground floor or in the lot outside,
*  there seems to have been a fire.
*  And of course, we don't know exactly what the cause is just yet.
*  But we do know that that fire spread rapidly because of the materials within this abandoned
*  stripped building.
*  Then I just took my coat.
*  I took a duvet.
*  Then I walked out.
*  I locked the back door.
*  I was praying in my heart that, oh, may God just protect me.
*  Just show me the way.
*  Pearl says she got out of her room, but she locked the door because she's hoping that she's
*  able to come back at some point.
*  And she grabs what she can.
*  She says she didn't have time to grab her door to schoolbooks.
*  And she runs outside.
*  And as she's running, she takes the risk of running down the stairs.
*  We know a lot of people were too afraid as the fire leapt up and they jumped out of the
*  third floor.
*  Pearl is one of the lucky ones that made it down the stairs.
*  But she says on one of the floors, there was a locked door.
*  Some pot was banging there, crying.
*  And she heard banging and banging.
*  And she says it is sound that she will never forget of a man screaming on the other side
*  of a locked door.
*  And she had to make that choice.
*  Does she go and try and free him?
*  She doesn't have a key.
*  I never, I never, I just thought of myself.
*  I had to save myself because I know that I have a child to live.
*  If I die, she will be left alone.
*  That's what was running in my mind that you know what, you cannot die in this fire.
*  You have to save yourself for this child.
*  It's the choice of, does she save herself for her daughter, who she lives for?
*  Or does she run and try and save this man who she doesn't know?
*  Because the truth is, she doesn't really know her neighbours.
*  And so many of the people, when I spoke to them outside, they said,
*  we didn't really know who we were living next door to because people were in and out.
*  Then no one went there because we were running for our lives.
*  We didn't know how far is the fire and what is going to happen.
*  Maybe the building is going to explode.
*  We just ran out.
*  She makes the choice and she runs in the opposite direction from the man who is screaming.
*  And when she finally makes it out into the street, she looks back and the building is aflame.
*  So I was standing there.
*  Some of the people were throwing themselves from the roof.
*  Second floor, third floor.
*  People are dying in front of us.
*  And people are jumping and some of them are falling to their deaths.
*  And as she's saying, she shakes her head and tears are just filling her eyes.
*  But her daughter, she's hardening herself at this point.
*  She says that, quite frankly, she just wants to move on from 8th year Albert Street.
*  I feel like all these people are relieved that what happened happened
*  because they were looking for a way out.
*  You're looking at them and they're free and they're relieved deep down inside because it was hell.
*  She doesn't want to have that memory.
*  You said that people clearly knew that a fire like this was possible.
*  That these hijacked buildings are a phenomenon and that there are over 600 of them.
*  You called this inevitable in some ways.
*  So who's at fault here?
*  You know, when I got to the scene, I asked the mayor that same question.
*  I said, people have been calling you about this building for years to my records, at least since May.
*  So who is at fault here?
*  And he said, while his administration is new, everyone is at fault.
*  And that is a catchall because that means that no one person will be held accountable here
*  because what this building represents is a series of failures within the city
*  and a series of failures within the country, quite frankly.
*  So my colleague John Elego found a trove of documents that showed emails
*  between city environmental officials sending emails to people in the health department,
*  their colleagues in public safety, their colleagues in the Johannesburg Property Company,
*  which was the state-owned entity that ran this company.
*  And they said, we have had inspections here at least from 2017.
*  They listed all the problems with the building.
*  And they said that this is a bad building.
*  It is turning into an emergency situation and we should do something about it.
*  What we did not find is what exactly people did about it.
*  Residents who live across the road, those are the people that I interviewed back in May already,
*  said that they had also called the police.
*  They called the police when they heard screams.
*  They called the police when they thought there was a murder,
*  when they saw a woman being thrown off the third or fourth floor.
*  And the police would come.
*  There would be a raid.
*  But then life would turn to normal.
*  And it would just go right back to the way things were.
*  And so there are all these failures at every step.
*  And when city officials were doing the sort of tour around the disaster,
*  giving press conferences, giving press briefings, blaming each other,
*  I asked one of the city officials, when was the last time you were inside this building?
*  When was the last time there was an inspection?
*  And he said to me, it was in 2019 because we couldn't risk going into a hostile environment,
*  hostile environment where people lived.
*  So stepping back for a minute here, Lindsay,
*  going back to something we talked about at the beginning of our conversation,
*  Johannesburg as the symbol of hope and optimism that really all of us had about South Africa back in 1994.
*  And now here we have this.
*  And I mean, I don't want to read too much into it.
*  We just had our own disastrous fire in the state of Hawaii.
*  But it does seem safe to say that this fire has shown Johannesburg to be a symbol of something else.
*  What would you say it is?
*  I think Johannesburg at this point is a symbol of the disappointment of what South Africa could have been.
*  Johannesburg has all these precincts in which the city tried to build and create and make it safe and livable.
*  But even as I was driving here, I would see a developed building and next door was a hijacked building.
*  Every time there is one step forward, there are two to three steps back.
*  And to be sure, there are great gleaming stretches of the city that still show the old promise.
*  But more and more for so many people, the city just doesn't hold the promise that it used to.
*  Lindsay, as someone from Johannesburg whose life has spanned this period, how do you see it?
*  You know, I grew up between a part of Soweto and Johannesburg suburbs.
*  I was bussed into school back and forth every day.
*  I've traveled from one end of Johannesburg.
*  And what I've loved about the city is its innovation, its diversity, its sense of energy.
*  And what I am finding is that the spirit of the city is slowly waning and struggling.
*  The city is struggling to rise above this political disaster.
*  It's struggling to rise above decades of neglect.
*  And it's struggling to rise above what is becoming a national problem in South Africa,
*  where it seems as if there is no clear path forward.
*  And it seems as if the people who have been entrusted in steering the city and steering the country
*  into this future that everybody dreamed about in 1994 are unable to do it.
*  And so for the people that I have been talking to, what they're seeing this is a leaderless city.
*  And that question is important because we are months away from a pivotal election.
*  Next year is not only the 30-year anniversary of democracy in South Africa.
*  It's also an election year, where some pundits are saying that they believe
*  that the ANC will go to its lowest margin yet.
*  It will still win. But what we're seeing then is that likely that it will be at its weakest.
*  And so what we're questioning then is who steps into that gap.
*  And what I think is that the lesson here is rather than relying on a political party to step into that gap,
*  what I have seen in the days after the fire is South Africans and immigrant communities coming together
*  to try and help each other, to feed each other, to find homes for each other, to help each other bury their dead.
*  And so what I hope is that South Africans will find their humanity in what has truly been an absolute tragedy.
*  And I hope that unlike the previous times that Johannesburg doesn't just move on from this one.
*  Lindsay, thank you.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. On Thursday.
*  Let me tell you something, New Yorkers. Never in my life have I had a problem that I did not see an end to.
*  I don't see an end to this.
*  This issue will destroy New York City.
*  As New York City has struggled to provide housing and services to the migrants who now number one hundred and ten thousand.
*  For months he has criticized President Biden and New York's governor, Kathy Hochul, for failing to help the city.
*  But his comments on Thursday were the most ominous yet and drew praise from Republicans and condemnation from some Democrats.
*  And Peter Navarro, a trade adviser to former President Donald Trump, was convicted on Thursday of criminal contempt of Congress over his defiance of a subpoena from the House Committee investigating the January 6th attack on the Capitol.
*  The verdict in federal district court in Manhattan made Mr. Navarro the second top adviser of Trump's to be found guilty of contempt for defying the committee's inquiry.
*  Stephen Bannon, a former strategist for Mr. Trump, was convicted of the same offense last summer.
