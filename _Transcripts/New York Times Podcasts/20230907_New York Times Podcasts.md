# Why One Drug Company Held Back a Better Drug

*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernice and this is The Daily.
*  For decades, drug companies have argued that patents are critical to bringing new drugs
*  to market.
*  Today, my colleague Rebecca Robbins, on a case that suggests they can also create perverse
*  incentives to hold new drugs back.
*  It's Thursday, September 7.
*  Rebecca, you report on the pharmaceutical industry and you've been reporting on a case involving
*  a big name American drug company.
*  Tell me about that reporting.
*  Yes, Sabrina.
*  We all know that prices are really high for many drugs in the United States.
*  In some respects, that is by design.
*  The way the system works is we rely on for-profit companies to spend a lot of money to develop
*  and bring to market new drugs.
*  In return for spending that money for taking all those risks, they get to have a monopoly
*  the last few years.
*  That allows them to sell their medications for lots of money and keep those prices high.
*  There are laws and regulations that protect that monopoly.
*  Part of the rationale for this system is that the promise of these profits creates incentives
*  for the company to produce new and better drugs to help more people.
*  But recently, my colleague, Cheryl Gastelberg and I came across a case that I think raises
*  serious questions about whether the system is always getting the best medications to patients
*  as quickly as possible.
*  Where does that story start?
*  I want to start with the story of a patient named David Swisher.
*  I read by Khario.
*  I'm good.
*  Thank you so much for your time.
*  Today, David is a 66-year-old retiree.
*  He's living in Florida after retiring from a long career in the airline industry that took
*  him all over the country for different jobs.
*  And so, back in 1997.
*  I was living in Texas, South of Houston.
*  And I just turned 40.
*  David started feeling ill.
*  And it was very intense.
*  I mean, it was like you're aching from head to toe.
*  I kept going into the emergency room for a week, telling him, I have to feel bad.
*  It's something's wrong.
*  I have to flew.
*  After the third time I went in, they're really, really not feeling good.
*  Someone was smart enough to send me upstairs and say, let's do a work over on this
*  guy and see what's going on.
*  And finally, after two nights in the hospital, one of the young interns, she came in and
*  she just says, well, we figured out what's wrong with you.
*  It turned out that he had HIV.
*  What was going through your head at that moment?
*  That I was going to drop dead.
*  And when he got his diagnosis, his mind immediately turned to worst fears.
*  I'd lived through all that epidemic from, the December of the year from 1978 until 1984.
*  And it just got so gloomy and dark.
*  He had a huge number of friends that he lost.
*  It was a really, really painful time.
*  I feel like 80% of my friends had died in a six-year period.
*  And all of them were under 30.
*  It just, they're coming on Friday and say, David, I parked my car on a bad spot.
*  And I left the keys in your desk.
*  Can you move my car so I can, you know, it doesn't get totally, and then bring it up to me
*  in the hospital on Monday.
*  Okay, so no problem.
*  I'd go move the vehicle, go up on Sunday night to see him and find out they were dead.
*  So when David got his HIV diagnosis in the mid 1990s, he thought it was a death sentence.
*  But it turns out it wasn't.
*  And that's because, by that point, drug companies were making huge strides in treating HIV
*  with powerful new medications.
*  But the first versions of these drugs had some really tough side effects.
*  They were really challenging for patients to take.
*  In my mind, I'm thinking, that's fine.
*  I'll be alive.
*  You know, that's much better.
*  I feel alive and the option, which wasn't good.
*  But I was allowed to go back to work and I was pretty much, you know, I'd lost some weight.
*  I didn't look really healthy, but I was able to read in a way and continue.
*  But over time, the medications became easier to take, fewer side effects, more convenient.
*  I went from a cocktail of a bunch of pills to one pill a day.
*  And in 2004, a drug company called Gilead released a drug called Truvada.
*  You may have heard of it today.
*  It's used for both preventing HIV and treating it.
*  I remember it was a big deal when it came out.
*  Exactly.
*  It was a huge deal.
*  And that's because it was really effective.
*  Many patients had less severe side effects on Truvada.
*  And it was more convenient to take.
*  It really became a game-chatur in the fight against AIDS.
*  And the key ingredient in Truvada is a version of something called Tenoffa Beer.
*  It prevents the HIV virus from replicating.
*  This doctor said to me, he says, well, you're doing well on the three medications you're
*  on.
*  But the drug rep has really been pushing this, touting it really as the medical medication.
*  It's all about convenience.
*  It's one pill.
*  All you got to do is take one pill.
*  So I started taking the Truvada.
*  That's where it started.
*  So David did well on this pill for a while.
*  But then something started to change for him.
*  He felt different.
*  I would say between 2006 and 2011, it had gotten progressively worse.
*  Just really achy.
*  Like achy inside my bones and just really like someone to kind of beat me up, you know,
*  just achy all over.
*  So it's...
*  And so after a long time trying to figure out what was going on, David's primary care doctor
*  had an idea.
*  He suggested bordering a scan of David's bones.
*  Okay, so we did it.
*  And so I sat there and he came in and he says, well, it's like bones of a 90-year-old woman.
*  I've never seen anyone at your age have such severe osteoporosis.
*  So at this point, your man is 62 being told you have the bones of a 90-year-old.
*  How did it feel to hear that?
*  Frightening.
*  All the primary care said was it's quite possible that it's toxicity from some of the medications
*  that you may be taking.
*  The conclusion he and his doctors came to was that even though Travato was treating David's
*  HIV and keeping him alive, it also appeared to be the most likely cause of the side effects,
*  the weakness in his bones and also some kidney issues he was experiencing.
*  So what does he do?
*  Well, fortunately for David, in 2016, Gilead released a new HIV drug.
*  This new drug contained a newer version of Tenoffivir.
*  Again, that's the active ingredient in Travato, the medication that appeared to be making David's
*  sick.
*  But this new formulation of Tenoffivir was different.
*  The tweak in the formulation of Tenoffivir turned out to be a big deal.
*  It ended up meaning that the medication didn't carry the same side effects that David had
*  been experiencing.
*  So David switched over to Gilead's newer version of the drug and his health began to
*  improve.
*  But David had spent years suffering from side effects he attributes to Travato.
*  He even took an early retirement because he felt he wasn't able to work anymore.
*  So he wanted to know what exactly had gone wrong with Travato.
*  So I googled kidney decline and severe osteoporosis.
*  David did some googling and he came across an advertisement from lawyers who were looking
*  for patients, patients who had experienced side effects like the ones he had.
*  These lawyers were suing Gilead and David was eligible to join the lawsuits.
*  And I thought about it really reluctantly.
*  I had never seen anybody so I was thinking that.
*  First of all, I wouldn't really know how to go about it.
*  And is that something that I wanted to get into or did I just want to let the medicines
*  do their work?
*  David was reluctant at first to reach out to these lawyers.
*  He was taking the new drug.
*  It seemed to be working much better for him.
*  But it just really got me mad.
*  But he was also angry that Travato, the drug he'd taken for years and years, appeared
*  to have hurt him so much.
*  And he was also angry at Gilead.
*  So David ultimately decided to join the lawsuits.
*  He became one of some 26,000 patients who were suing Gilead.
*  And what are they arguing in the lawsuit?
*  And on what grounds are they suing Gilead?
*  Warriors for these patients have put together a number of claims.
*  They're arguing the usual sorts of things you see in personal injury lawsuits.
*  That Gilead was aware of the problems and did not adequately warn patients about these
*  potential side effects.
*  But they're also making a more unusual claim.
*  They say that the newer version of Tenoffivir, that's the one David eventually switched
*  over to, that didn't have the same bone and kidney side effects, could have been made
*  available to patients about a decade earlier than it was.
*  So what does that mean?
*  There was a newer version that's better and they just held it?
*  That's right.
*  They say that Gilead had been working on this newer version in the early 2000s.
*  They also claim that even though there was good reason at the time to think that the
*  newer version would turn out to be safer, that it wouldn't have those same kidney and
*  bone side effects.
*  Gilead still decided to delay bringing it to market.
*  So they're arguing that the company actually had a newer version that was safer that they
*  withheld.
*  But why would they do that?
*  Well, the theory is that it was all about maximizing profits.
*  Okay, so explain what you mean by that.
*  Well, it all goes back to this system that I was talking about.
*  This is for profit system of drug development.
*  A central part of that is patents, which protect a drug company's intellectual property.
*  Patents are really the lifeblood of the pharmaceutical industry.
*  So the way it works is when a drug company develops a product, they can and do file for lots
*  of patents.
*  And together, these patents create a monopoly, which lasts for years.
*  That means other companies cannot sell a generic version of the same drug.
*  And so prices stay high because whichever company controls the patents faces no competition.
*  And what's the rationale for that?
*  The thinking is if you were to do all this research and spend all this money to bring
*  a drug to market and then immediately your competitors could just come in and sell knockoff
*  copies of your hard work so you couldn't make money.
*  Well, then you wouldn't have much of an incentive to do that innovation in the first place.
*  And I think there's broad agreement that a lot of times that system works really well.
*  But critics say there are also downsides to this system.
*  For one, it keeps drug prices higher for longer.
*  And in David's case, his lawyers are arguing that the system created an incentive, pergilia
*  to delay bringing its innovation to the market.
*  That was the newer drug that would have been safer for David.
*  So Gilead had a monopoly on the older version of the drug.
*  That's the one that was in the medication that David took.
*  And that monopoly was due to expire in 2017.
*  So that meant that Gilead had full protection against competition until then and could keep
*  prices high.
*  And the plaintiff's lawyers argue that Gilead intentionally decided not to release the
*  newer, potentially safer version of the drug so that it could make more money.
*  Okay, so the plaintiffs are saying that we've been suffering from these side effects, which
*  you Gilead knew about.
*  And all the while, you had a new drug that didn't have those side effects, but you didn't
*  release it because you didn't want to effectively eat into the profit that the first drug was
*  still bringing in.
*  That's right.
*  And what did Gilead say?
*  And what was their response about this allegation that they intentionally withheld the drug for
*  profit?
*  So Gilead denies the allegation completely.
*  The company acknowledges that they did delay the drug's development.
*  In fact, they publicly acknowledged in 2004 when they made the decision.
*  They put out a press release announcing that they had decided to stop developing the drug.
*  But the company says that had nothing to do with profit.
*  The real reason they said at the time and they say now is that the newer version wasn't
*  sufficiently different from the older version to justify moving it forward.
*  And on its face, that's a completely reasonable reason to not move forward with a drug.
*  It doesn't make sense to bring to market two virtually identical versions of the same
*  thing.
*  But as this lawsuit has unfolded and moved through the court system, the lawyers for the
*  patients who are suing have, as part of the normal discovery process, managed to get their
*  hands on internal company documents from around the time in early 2000s when Gilead executives
*  were making decisions around the development for this newer version of the drug.
*  And those documents give a really rare view of what was going on behind the scenes of what
*  the company executives were considering.
*  And I think they suggest that Gilead's version of the Vence doesn't reflect the whole story.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Rebecca, you told us that the plaintiffs in this case are arguing that Gilead with held
*  a safer drug from the market in order to maximize their profits.
*  Gilead denies this.
*  But now the plaintiffs lawyers have their hands on all of these internal documents.
*  So what do we actually know about what happened here?
*  So the documents give us a really fascinating look inside this drug company at a time when
*  executives were making decisions about these medications.
*  So let's go back to the year 2001.
*  That was the year that the FDA approved the original version of Tenoffivir.
*  And in those early years, the evidence began to accumulate that some patients, very small
*  fraction of the overall number, but some patients, did develop side effects, typically problems
*  with their bones, their kidneys, that appeared to be caused at least in part by the older
*  version of Tenoffivir.
*  But Gilead was not just banking on the original formulation of this drug.
*  Like companies typically do.
*  Gilead scientists were tinkering in the lab with other very similar compounds.
*  The idea was that if you make small changes tinker with molecules, you might find some
*  dramatically improved drug or learn something important or have a backup in case the product
*  that was being prioritized didn't pan out.
*  Okay.
*  So the molecules stood out pretty quickly.
*  The company's scientists identified this newer version as having potential in its own
*  right.
*  Maybe it should be developed on its own merits as a new potential blockbuster in the drug
*  company's pipeline.
*  And I assume this is the version of the drug that the lawsuit talks about, right?
*  So what was so exciting about this new version?
*  Yeah.
*  So early studies conducted an animals and an laboratory.
*  It indicated that this new formulation was much better than the original version at
*  delivering Tenoffivir to the cells in the body.
*  It was targeting.
*  And that meant that way less of it was leaking into the bloodstream where it would travel
*  to kidneys and bones and cause this toxicity.
*  And the early studies showed also that it could be given at a lower dose.
*  Now it's important to say the Gilead scientists did not have definitive proof at this point
*  that the newer formulation of the drug was safer in humans.
*  You would have to run bigger clinical trials to know for sure.
*  But there was some pretty strong early evidence that this was promising.
*  That was echoed in an internal memo from 2002 that said the newer version, quote, may
*  translate into a better side effect profile and less drug-related toxicity.
*  End quote.
*  That's huge, right?
*  I mean, that wouldn't mean that this new formulation was likely not to cause those
*  awful side effects we heard David and so many others had.
*  Right.
*  So at the time, there was a lot of optimism within the company about this newer version.
*  It appeared to be full steam ahead with this drug.
*  Companies scientists were updating the research community at conferences, executives were keeping
*  investors at rest.
*  The company was running projections looking at how much money the drug could make.
*  And in 2002, the company began the first human clinical trial of the newer version to
*  evaluated safety.
*  In that same year, you can see in the documents that a Gilead employee mapped out a development
*  timeline for the newer version.
*  In the timeline projected that the company could get the newer version to market as quickly
*  as 2006.
*  So that would have been just a few years after David had started on the old version of
*  the drug.
*  Exactly.
*  But that's not what ended up happening.
*  Even though there had been all this excitement among Gilead scientists about the newer version
*  of the drug, at some point around 2003, company executives started to sour on rushing it
*  to market.
*  And Gilead did not follow through on those plans that could have brought it to market
*  by around 2006.
*  Why?
*  So these internal documents indicate that executives started to worry that releasing the
*  newer version of the drug would eat into the market share for the older version of the
*  drug.
*  OK.
*  Now, the phrase they used was cannibalize.
*  Because then the new drug would, quote, ultimately cannibalize and, quote, the market for the older
*  drug.
*  Gilead would essentially be competing with itself.
*  So that's pretty explicit.
*  That's right.
*  And remember, Gilead, at this time, knew it had a monopoly on selling the older version
*  of the drug that would last until 2017.
*  So there was still a lot of runways, still a lot of time for Gilead to earn money from
*  this franchise.
*  Right.
*  This is a rare golden ticket.
*  They want to keep it as long as it'll go.
*  Exactly.
*  So instead of pushing forward on this newer version of the drug, the documents indicate
*  that the company was formulating a plan.
*  It was called a patent extension strategy.
*  And it's repeatedly referred to that way in the documents.
*  What the company wanted to do was find a way to maintain its monopoly, to maintain sales
*  beyond the expiration of the monopoly on the first drug.
*  And the internal documents from 2003 showed that the company ultimately planned to time
*  the release of the newer version of the drug, right when it would be optimal to switch patients
*  over from the older drug.
*  This is right before the patent was expiring.
*  One memo says, the development of the newer version, quote, is timed such that it is
*  launched in 2015.
*  And quote, notice that a drug like that isn't going to take 12 years to develop.
*  So this is a business analyst at the company proposing delaying the release of the newer
*  version.
*  And so in 2004, Gilead halted the development of the newer version of the drug.
*  Okay.
*  So to recap, these documents suggest that company executives didn't want to squander any of
*  this precious patent.
*  They wanted to be able to keep prices high for as long as possible to maximize profits.
*  And so they halted the development of a new potentially better drug, which is really
*  the opposite of what the whole patent system is meant to do.
*  That's the allegation.
*  Now the documents don't explicitly say that the reason for halting development was because
*  the company was following any sort of strategy to try to maximize profits.
*  But the documents do provide context around the business considerations Gilead was thinking
*  about at the time.
*  And the plaintiffs say that the way the chronology ultimately played out, the way things ended
*  up unfolding validates their accusation.
*  What we know is that the newer version of the drug sat on a shelf for years, despite
*  those early signs that it might turn out to be safer for some patients.
*  Gilead kept selling the older version that became a blockbuster, bringing in billions of
*  dollars and keeping millions of patients alive.
*  And then in 2010, Gilead decided to resurrect the newer version of the drug.
*  They did the clinical trials.
*  They went through the regulatory process and they released it in 2015.
*  So they followed through their plan to extend the pact, the one they talked about in the
*  documents.
*  It appears that way.
*  Now Gilead said this had nothing to do with following through on any sort of patent
*  extension strategy.
*  They said the reason they changed their mind about whether the newer drug made sense to move
*  forward with.
*  The situation for patients had changed by then.
*  One consideration was that long-term HIV survivors were getting older.
*  They were more susceptible to bone and kidney problems.
*  And it made sense to have a safer option for them.
*  And when the newer version came out, Gilead positioned it as just as effective as Trabada,
*  but gentler on the bones and kidneys.
*  In other words, it doesn't have the same side effects David suffered from.
*  So when the patent on the older version expired in 2017 and drug makers offering generic
*  versions were able to come in with their own products, the price of Trabada ultimately
*  went way down from about $22,000 a year to under $400 a year.
*  Gilead successfully switched a lot of patients from older version to the newer version.
*  And those patients are still exposed to the higher price.
*  That's a sticker price of $26,000 a year.
*  And the switch to the newer version was really, really successful.
*  Today, Gilead drugs containing the newer version account for half the market for HIV treatment
*  and prevention.
*  And it makes sense that people switched over, right?
*  Because this new version of the drug has fewer side effects.
*  Well, it's a little more complicated, actually.
*  The newer version doesn't have the old side effects, but it does have its own side effects.
*  It can cause weight gain and elevated cholesterol levels in some patients.
*  So I think the reality is that the older version is safer for some patients, and the newer
*  version is safer for other patients.
*  But the lawyers in David's case say that if both versions of the drug had been available
*  on the market, at least patients and their doctors would have had the option to choose
*  which version would best suit their needs based on those risks.
*  So you might switch patients who were experiencing kidney and bone issues over to the newer version.
*  Okay.
*  However the mode is, what happened in the end was that the company did make enormous
*  profits because the release of the new drug ended up being perfectly timed, right?
*  So how common is this?
*  Like is this a strategy that you see a lot in the pharmaceutical industry?
*  So under the current system, there are a ton of complicated ways that companies essentially
*  extend their monopolies and maximize their profits.
*  So the phenomenon that we saw play out with Gilead's versions of Tenoffa Beer is called
*  product hopping.
*  And that's because you're hopping patients from the older version of the drug over to the
*  newer version of the drug just before the patent for the older drug runs out.
*  But there are other common strategies too.
*  One is called patent thickening.
*  Patent thickening?
*  That's right.
*  The idea here is to file so many patents on all sorts of things.
*  The dosage, the delivery method, even things like a safety program to ensure that the drug
*  is safely distributed.
*  And the idea is to make it as hard as possible for generic competitors to find their way through
*  like a thicket.
*  It's hard to navigate a thicket.
*  Like a thicket, an actual thicket of patents.
*  That's right.
*  The idea is that it's so costly, so time consuming for a smaller company to wade through that
*  thicket of patents that they might give up.
*  They might decide it's too risky that they would face lawsuit or not be able to keep
*  the product on the market.
*  And companies do all sorts of things to try to fight off generic competition.
*  They'll reach deals with generic competitors to minimize the impact of generic competition
*  or sometimes sue them claiming that companies are infringing on their patents.
*  So these strategies you're describing, they don't seem to have that much to do with creating
*  new treatments.
*  They seem more about using pretty powerful legal and financial muscles to flood the zone
*  in a way that blocks competition.
*  But in the case of Gilead and Tenoff of year, that meant not just blocking another company
*  from entering the market, but actually hitting pause on developing a new drug, their own
*  drug that could be less harmful.
*  It feels ethically squishy.
*  That's right.
*  There are definitely legal questions here, but there's also an ethical question.
*  Oftentimes when you see product hopping, there's not a ton of consequence about when the
*  newer version is released.
*  Oftentimes it's even criticized for being a tiny tweak, something that isn't important,
*  something that doesn't improve outcomes, doesn't improve quality of life for patients.
*  But I think what's distinctive about this case is the allegation that the timing of the
*  release of the newer version of the drug resulted in harm to patients.
*  The stakes here had an impact for patients' health.
*  Not only for their pocketbooks.
*  Right.
*  And I think that's one of the questions that's going to be addressed as the courts decide
*  whether or not these lawsuits can move forward.
*  It seems like the argument both in court but also ethically rests on whether Gilead way
*  back in the early 2000s actually knew that this newer drug would come out ahead when weighing
*  the pros and cons.
*  They had reason to believe it might turn out to be gentler on the bones and kidneys, but
*  it was still really early days in the research.
*  So you could at the time reasonably conclude that the signal just wasn't strong enough for
*  Gilead to have an ethical imperative to put the drug on a fast track.
*  Yeah, but the question isn't it?
*  How much evidence was enough evidence for Gilead to have a responsibility to move the drug
*  forward?
*  So what kind of impact could a decision in this case have?
*  So Gilead's lawyers say in legal filings that this could set a dangerous precedent, this
*  argument that the plaintiffs' lawyers are making.
*  They are saying that if any company can be held liable for not releasing a product on
*  a specific timetable, that could jeopardize innovation.
*  And the concern here is that if drug companies could be sued for not releasing products
*  immediately, then they would be less likely to take the risks, spend huge amounts of money,
*  to run clinical trials if they could get in trouble if they didn't get the timing just
*  right.
*  Right, I mean, when you think about it, it is kind of strange, like a court ordering
*  a company to release its product before it wants to.
*  Exactly.
*  For instance, you probably wouldn't see Apple being held liable for not releasing its
*  latest iPhone quickly enough.
*  And I think there's precedent in past cases suggesting Gilead has a pretty strong
*  defense here.
*  You know, when these sorts of patent strategies are challenged in court, drug companies
*  often end up winning.
*  On the other hand, this isn't an iPhone.
*  It's a drug, right?
*  Kind of different category.
*  Right.
*  The critics here of Gilead say that drugs can't be treated like other products, that it's
*  a matter of life and death, not just a question of when people get the newest version of the
*  iPhone.
*  So is there a way to change the incentives for companies?
*  Well, one avenue is cases like Davids, which could set a precedent for better or for worse,
*  depending on your perspective.
*  We'll see how that plays out in the courts.
*  But as for policy changes, federal lawmakers regularly introduce bills that aim to crack
*  down on various aspects of patent gaming.
*  But those haven't gained much traction so far.
*  And there are lots of reasons for that.
*  The industry lobbies hard against regulation.
*  But another consideration is that policy makers are worried about interfering with the
*  system that we have set up.
*  The system that in a lot of cases has been extraordinarily successful at producing breakthrough
*  therapies.
*  And I think this is what is so hard about regulating the pharmaceutical industry.
*  We want to strike a balance between the benefits the system brings and the ways that it
*  can sometimes harm patients.
*  We don't want to create incentives that discourage companies from coming up with breakthrough therapies.
*  We want to create the space where companies will take the risks to bring the next truvada
*  to market.
*  But we also don't want to have a system where companies prioritize profits over patients,
*  where safer medications get delayed for business reasons, and patients suffer.
*  We want to discourage companies from gaming the system.
*  Rebecca, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  The Biden administration announced it would prohibit drilling in 13 million acres of the
*  National Petroleum Reserve and cancel all existing leases in the Arctic National Wildlife
*  Refuge.
*  It was Biden's most aggressive move yet to protect millions of acres of pristine Alaskan wilderness
*  from oil and gas exploration.
*  It would not stop the enormous Willow Oil Drilling Project in the same vicinity that Biden
*  approved earlier this year and that climate activists oppose.
*  And the Special Counsel investigating Hunter Biden said on Wednesday that he planned to
*  indict the president's son on a gun charge before the end of the month.
*  In a three-page update filed in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, David Weiss laid
*  out plans to bring charges related to Biden's purchase of a pistol in 2018.
*  When prosecutors say he lied on a federal form by stating that he was not using drugs
*  at the time.
*  The move was prompted by the acrimonious collapse of a plea deal between Biden and federal
*  prosecutors in July.
*  Today's episode was produced by Eric Crunky and Will Read.
*  It was edited by Liz O'Bailan and Paige Cowatt, fact-checked by Nicole Pesalca and Susan
