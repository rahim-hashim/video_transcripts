# The Voters Willing to Abandon Biden Over Gaza

*  Okay, so now I welcome everyone. My name is Mona Mauri and I think it's so inspiring that we have
*  people from so many different professions and paths of life and ethnicities
*  joining us here today to do the phone banking. We really want to send a strong
*  message using our voting power to let Biden know that we strongly reject his
*  aiding and abetting and funding of the genocide and war in Gaza.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavern, you see, and this is the daily.
*  This is Abda Rahman, Hamad. I'm calling for Michigan.
*  Hi, this is Ian with the Michigan Unlimited Campaign and we want to see
*  foreign Gaza now. Is this Hussein?
*  In the past few weeks, activists in Michigan began calling voters in the state
*  asking them to protest President Biden's support for Israel by not voting for him
*  in the Democratic primary. Are you planning to vote in the Democratic primary
*  because we are asking folks to vote uncommitted?
*  Michigan has one of the largest Arab-American populations in the country
*  and the activists are trying to turn its anger over Gaza into a political force.
*  Biden is not listening to us, so this is a right time to give him message before
*  the general election, okay?
*  One that could be decisive in this critical swing state where winning in
*  November will likely be a matter of the slinest of margins.
*  You are going to be voting uncommitted, okay?
*  I'm amazing. I'm sorry.
*  Free Palestine, that's right.
*  Wait, can you ask three of your friends to do that as well?
*  Today, my colleague Jennifer Medina on how Israel's war in Gaza
*  is changing politics in Michigan.
*  It's Tuesday, February 27.
*  So Jenny, the Democratic primary in Michigan is today
*  and it's an election that typically wouldn't matter very much, right?
*  I mean, Joe Biden, of course, is the incumbent and he's already pretty much
*  sealed the deal to be the nominee.
*  So why are you covering it?
*  Yes, it's true that a primary with an incumbent president is typically
*  pretty unimportant and there's normally a low turnout.
*  And even in this primary, Joe Biden is absolutely expected to win.
*  And so there's a little surprise most of the time,
*  but this year we have this whole new wild factor
*  and that's the war in Gaza.
*  And the war has created enormous anger in a state like Michigan,
*  where there are tens of thousands of voters potentially looking for a way to
*  voice their anger in the primary election.
*  So enormous anger at the war in Gaza in a state like Michigan.
*  So tell me about that. What is it about Michigan?
*  So Michigan is this interesting state.
*  First of all, it's been a swing state for a very long time,
*  but also in the context of the war in Gaza,
*  it's really interesting because of the demographics.
*  Michigan has one of the largest Arab American populations in the country.
*  We're talking something in the ballpark of 200,000 Arab Americans.
*  And that's a group of people who have been angry with US policy toward Israel for decades.
*  But because of the war in Gaza, it's something totally different.
*  It's bringing anger to the fore like never before.
*  Yeah, and it's not just Arab Americans who are angry.
*  Right, it's become a central issue for Democrats on the left.
*  As the war in Gaza has reached on and the death toll has risen,
*  we've seen more and more people speak out against Biden for supporting Israel.
*  And they've begun to threaten to withhold their vote for him because of that support.
*  And we've seen this coalition led by Arab American voters in Detroit
*  begin to concentrate their anger on the Michigan primary.
*  And they're asking a few different things.
*  Some organizers are telling voters that they should check an uncommitted box on the primary ballot,
*  essentially saying none of the above.
*  And other people urged voters to write in free Palestine or free Gaza.
*  And there's lots of different ways they could protest,
*  but there's a group that really coalesces around this idea of uncommitted.
*  And the bottom line for them is they want to send a message to Biden saying,
*  if he doesn't change policy, he will have a real problem on his hands for the election in November.
*  Right. Okay, so speaking of November, let's play this out here.
*  Let's say nothing changes after the primary.
*  What happens if these same voters don't support Biden in the general election in November?
*  I think there's no question it would be a huge problem for Biden.
*  Arab Americans are a group of voters that have largely supported Democrats in the past.
*  And it's pretty unlikely that a majority of them would move to Trump.
*  But more realistically, it's definitely possible that they just sit out the election or vote for
*  a third party candidate. And in a state like Michigan, that would be a huge deal with huge consequences.
*  Biden won in 2020 with only roughly 150,000 votes.
*  And in 2016, Clinton lost by just 11,000 votes.
*  If even a portion of Arab American voters decide not to vote for Biden,
*  it could have huge consequences for the state and even the country.
*  Wow, so huge stakes. Yes. And the question really becomes how big is this movement and how deep
*  does that anger run?
*  Oh, there it is. Well, I know. Oh, it's right next to a potential.
*  So I went to Detroit along with producers, us at Chaturveini and Claire Tennis Getter,
*  to really understand how this strategy was resonating in the Arab American community.
*  Were those rank and file voters really rallying around this effort, this urge to register their
*  anger by voting against Biden at the ballot box? We are outside the Islamic Center of Detroit,
*  where they are about to start new prayers. So we started with going to a mosque for Friday prayers.
*  And this is just outside of Dearborn in Detroit. And there are hundreds of people gathered there
*  for new and Friday prayers. Latifa? Yeah. And we met up with a woman Latifa Jamal,
*  who was handing out flyers, urging people to abandon Biden.
*  And the level of frustration and dismay and the trail
*  was just clearly evident. That's not for Biden? Yeah, I know. I'm in the group.
*  And of the roughly 50 or so people we heard from,
*  only one person said that he was sticking with Biden. Wow, I love love Biden.
*  I know after he was doing in Gaza, I'm sorry about this is a wait. Did you vote for him in 2020?
*  Almost everyone we heard from outside the mosque said they voted for Biden in 2020,
*  but now said they weren't so sure. Is there anything he could do to gain back your vote?
*  So when we asked people what Biden could do to win back their vote, of course, stop this massacre.
*  Many said ceasefire at a minimum. I don't think so unless he goes send the army
*  and create a Palestinian state and reimburse all every Palestinian. But many said they wanted more.
*  We know how Biden has reacted in the situation now. We can't think about what ifs.
*  For me at least I can't survive and stand that. I need to get him out.
*  So Jenny, I guess, you know, listening to you talk to people,
*  it feels a little tricky to me because the US obviously, you know, is an important and powerful
*  ally of Israel, but it is a separate country from Israel. So I guess I'm wondering, you know,
*  how the people you were talking to process that. I mean, Biden is fundamentally not the
*  boss of Netanyahu. You know, the US doesn't have the power to actually stop the war and stop the
*  bombing. I think for many of these voters, it's not all that complicated. They see this through the
*  lens of US support for Israel, not just support of the war now, but also decades of policy of
*  billions of dollars of aid going toward Israel. That aid is mostly unconditional.
*  And even though in recent weeks you've seen Biden shift his rhetoric a little bit, he spoke
*  from the White House calling Israel's reaction over the top. These voters see that rhetoric
*  is basically empty and they see nothing short of a fundamental policy shift as enough.
*  And what has the Biden administration been saying in the face of this criticism? I mean,
*  is Biden responded? I think his administration has tried. They sent White House officials and
*  foreign policy officials to do listening sessions where they kind of apologize and express regret
*  for some of the past actions, basically saying they should have done more to indicate that they value
*  Palestinian lives. And then just this week and Democrat Rocana, a congressman from California,
*  went and tried to sort of step in unofficially for the Biden campaign and try to sort of reassure
*  voters. But I don't know that any of that has done much reassuring at all because the level of
*  anger that they have just goes beyond wanting to be heard. They don't think listening as enough
*  and they want to see action. Okay, so it's clear from your reporting that a lot of people are very
*  upset with Biden. But I guess that raises the question about the alternative, about Trump.
*  I mean, this is the president who brought the country the Muslim ban as we remember from the
*  early days of his term. And you know, it's also the guy who broke with years of American tradition
*  on where the US Embassy in Israel should be based. I mean, he moved it to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.
*  So the question in my mind is, do you think at the end of the day, Jenny, when all of these
*  voters are staring at their options, that they'll ultimately just hold their nose and vote for Biden?
*  So there's really two groups of people.
*  There's the people who are voting and focused on today, on voting and committed and registering
*  a threat and are leaving open the possibility of going back to Biden come November.
*  But then there's a whole nother group of people and it's a large group of people who are already
*  saying, forget it. I'm done. I'm definitely not going to vote for Biden in November.
*  They understand the stakes, they understand the consequences, and still they've made up their mind.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Jenny, you said that you talked to Democratic voters in Michigan who said that they were not
*  going to vote for Biden, really no matter what, despite the prospect of Trump.
*  How did they talk about that?
*  So I went to speak with a long time Democrat and Palestinian American activists who lives in the
*  suburbs of Detroit. Hi. Her name is Terri Ahual. She is 67 years old and she lives with her husband
*  Bob Morris and their dog, JV.
*  And almost from the moment you walk in their home, it becomes clear that being a Democrat is a central
*  part of her identity. It's clear from the books that she has on her coffee table.
*  My husband with President Kennedy and his father.
*  It's clear from the walls of photos that she and Bob have, which is just a sort of who's who in
*  Democratic politics stretching back decades, really.
*  I have done and as you see President Bill Clinton at the time.
*  You call it a wall of politicians, but there are Democrats.
*  Democrats. We don't have really, yeah.
*  I always want for the first, they just happen to be Democrats.
*  And we sat down in their dining room.
*  Terri, can you just start by telling us a little bit about your childhood, what life was like
*  where you were? So I grew up in Romala, which is West of Jerusalem.
*  And Terri told us about growing up in Romala in the West Bank. And she said it was basically a
*  calm, happy childhood until she was about 10 years old. And that's where I call
*  introduction to hell. In 1967, the Arab-Israeli War broke out and Terri's family and neighbors
*  sheltered together in her house. We ended up with 30 people in our basement and it's a very small
*  basement. And all of a sudden the bomb starts, you know, the scream starts and all of a sudden
*  and it just kind of like boom, boom, boom. And then the radio and then people start praying.
*  And they were crowded together in that basement as tanks rolled in.
*  There is no way to describe the horror that you see, the crying, the smell, the fear.
*  After the war, Terri's parents grew really anxious about her and her sister's safety.
*  So eventually they were sent to live with her uncle in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan.
*  And when she gets there, she got a job in a local restaurant. She eventually graduates from high
*  school. And then after just a few years, she falls into politics, basically by accident.
*  A Democrat asks her if she wants to volunteer for a candidate running for the state house.
*  And almost immediately she just loves it.
*  But I stuff enveloped like my life depended on it. I will come in and they say you want to come
*  in at five o'clock in the morning and lick stamps. I will come in at five o'clock in the morning
*  and lick stamps. I suffer bored in here.
*  At this point, Terri throws herself headfirst into politics. She's volunteering on local elections.
*  And she's also getting involved with national democratic politics.
*  So I was one of the first people that pushed for Bill Clinton, worked on his campaign.
*  I was working my regular job and working basically after five till
*  11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, whatever to get Bill Clinton elected.
*  And what's she trying to accomplish with these campaigns?
*  I think it's two things. On the local level, she recognizes the immediacy of government and
*  action to create real change in her own backyard. And then I think with some of these more
*  national campaigns, she's really hoping to push for change for Palestinians and influence
*  the democratic party's foreign policy.
*  Boy, so I'm a believer that you cannot just stand on the outside and scream,
*  why don't you work within the system and within the system, things will change.
*  And then like many Democrats, she's really shocked when Trump wins and enters office.
*  Horror, horror, horror.
*  I look at Trump and I tremble with fear.
*  She's horrified the day he gets elected.
*  The day he got elected, I really could not.
*  She is shocked by the Muslim ban.
*  I was just petrified. You know, my nephew whose name is Muhammad is going to be injured
*  because of all the hate that is directed at them.
*  She's horrified by the decision to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
*  Just when you think he cannot get any lower, he gets lower.
*  So in 2020 comes around after Biden becomes the democratic nominee.
*  Terry spends a lot of time and effort calling up friends and family members and acquaintances,
*  trying to convince them to show up and vote for Biden in the presidential election.
*  And then I just said, let's work and start convincing all the people that were in
*  opposition. So what was that pitch? Give me the pitch that you gave to people at that time.
*  It's either Biden or Trump. And Trump is hates Muslim, hates Europe, hate everybody.
*  If you're not white, you're not going to be a person that is going to be represented.
*  And so it was not that Biden is a quality.
*  There is a bad and terrible. We don't want the terrible.
*  It's not that she's this huge Biden supporter.
*  But when Biden becomes the democratic nominee, she supports him.
*  And when he announces he's going to run again in 2024, she still supports him.
*  But then October 7th happens.
*  Right. And so for Terry, she immediately thinks back to her experience in 1967
*  and anticipates what she thinks will be an aggressive Israeli response.
*  Immediately after I knew because I lived through what Israel does when the Palestinian perpetrate
*  violence, I knew there was going to be hell to be paid.
*  And Jenny, just Terry talk about the role of Hamas in this war. I mean, the fact that Hamas
*  perpetrated this violent attack on Israel on October 7th.
*  So Terry kept talking about how she really thinks of herself as a pacifist.
*  And so I asked her about this.
*  Does any of you, any part of you put the blame on Hamas?
*  Yes, because they used, they used violence. So yes.
*  But to me, the question that I would ask, should the Palestinian indigenous people of that land
*  do they have the right to defend themselves?
*  And she said quite clearly that she disagrees with the use of violence.
*  But it's also clear that she feels quite conflicted and really sees Palestinians as in an impossible
*  position. If you are the desperate person in Gaza who have no options, what would you do?
*  And then as the weeks and the war dragged on and Israel continued its bombardment,
*  she really became very angry with her own country, with Biden's response to the war.
*  Every human beings like matter, but he diminished the tragedy of Palestinian by him going and
*  embracing Netanyahu.
*  Almost immediately, she's really enraged by Biden's decision to fight Israel very quickly,
*  to embrace Netanyahu and to offer basically unequivocal support for the war.
*  I kept saying he will self-correct. Somebody or the policy makers will change.
*  But she tries to be patient and she sort of has this expectation that Biden is going to change
*  his mind or withdraw some support.
*  And as the time went by, it got even worse.
*  And as it becomes more and more clear that that's not going to happen,
*  everything Israel wants they get.
*  What does that say that my life doesn't matter?
*  She really begins to think that's it. I can't vote for him, not in the primary and not in November.
*  You want my vote. You cannot kill my people in my name.
*  As simple as that.
*  How do you wrestle with the fact that that decision could help Trump win?
*  It's a very hard decision, but it is not me who's putting Trump in place.
*  It's the president himself.
*  I'm not at fault that people like me are not going to vote for him.
*  It's his policy and his action.
*  So don't put the blame on me.
*  Put it on him.
*  He knows that my vote will be for him if his actions are different.
*  And so is that me basically saying I demand more of my leaders?
*  Yeah. Why not?
*  I mean, you're saying, look, this isn't my fault.
*  This isn't, it's not because of me, Biden should change.
*  Is there anything that you think that Trump is going to do better for Palestinians?
*  I have zero confidence in Trump period.
*  There's not one ayoda of anything I want from Trump.
*  I want him to go away.
*  But I am sad for our country that we do not have viable alternatives on both sides.
*  But it's the system that we have.
*  Yes.
*  It's the only system that we have.
*  And it's a system that you participated in.
*  Yes.
*  Enthusiastically for decades.
*  Absolutely.
*  So I have two bad candidates.
*  So what is my alternative?
*  I don't have alternatives.
*  I am not representing.
*  I know I'm in a place where I am going nowhere.
*  That's how hopeless what I stand.
*  Jenny, it's really striking that, you know, four years ago, Terry looked at this exact
*  same choice and felt pretty clear that to her,
*  Trump was a worse option than Biden.
*  I mean, so much so that she campaigned for Biden, right?
*  But now she looks at the two and sees them as equally bad options.
*  Like, that's a pretty remarkable shift, not least because, you know,
*  these are two very different leaders when it comes to the Palestinian issue.
*  Trump is much closer to the Netanyahu government and a whole range of things.
*  Things that she probably be pretty opposed to.
*  So how does she sink that in her mind?
*  I think for Terry, she really sees not that much difference between Biden and Trump.
*  She sees this as sort of cell teas that don't matter in the long run
*  because of what's happening in Gaza.
*  This person hates me.
*  This person want me killed.
*  That's all what it is.
*  But Terry understands that not everybody sees it that way.
*  And that's clear even in her own conversations with her husband, Bob.
*  And it's worth noting here that Bob's family is Jewish.
*  But he says there's really no daylight between him and Terry on the Israeli Palestinian conflict.
*  And maybe the only thing they disagree about is the role of President Biden.
*  And then Bob and I, we talked.
*  So they remembered this fight they had on the drive back home from Thanksgiving with Bob's family.
*  We're driving on the freeway leaving T.C.
*  And what trigger it is something on the radio and they said Biden and Palestine at the same time.
*  I think Biden was saying something about compassion.
*  And they say they heard someone say something about Biden.
*  But in the meantime, he was doing things with Gaza.
*  And I scull like I basically said to Bob.
*  I just don't understand how horrible about human being he is.
*  And Terry remembers just a rough day.
*  He's such a hypocrite.
*  And I was probably saying, you know, the Supreme Court and Trump, you know, or something else.
*  And I don't bite anymore.
*  And I don't and then he blew up.
*  And Bob remembers getting really emotional.
*  I just had a breakdown.
*  I said, I just can't take it anymore.
*  And I mean, when I say I had a breakdown, I haven't driven the damn car.
*  And I'm starting to cry.
*  And what's going through your mind, T.C. Bob?
*  There's nobody I love more on this earth than Terry.
*  But if I say anything, I'm a bad guy.
*  And Terry understands you felt really bad.
*  We're 95% on everything except he sees Biden via the prison of the Supreme Court.
*  I'm looking at it from the prison of Palestine.
*  I mean, it sounds like you're saying you're already seeing things crumble.
*  And you're saying this is our last chance before things crumble.
*  Well, to be fair, I want to bite my run.
*  I did want him to be a one-term one.
*  You did?
*  Yes.
*  I wanted him.
*  I truly thought he could be a guy who writes the ship.
*  And in some ways he has.
*  Biden did get successful legislation passed in a bipartisan way.
*  And some of his legislation is really good.
*  But he wasn't as good as I had hoped.
*  But why do you why will you stick with him?
*  Donald Trump.
*  I mean, I am very concerned about our democracy.
*  I think it is entirely possible.
*  The Democrats could win the House and the Senate.
*  And the presidency this time.
*  And that can make a big, big difference in terms of how we can make some positive changes.
*  And that's a whole by I guess I have a short-term pessimist and a long-term optimistic, you know.
*  So he sees things and I see I see potential.
*  He doesn't.
*  He sees, okay, this is our system.
*  This is how it's always been.
*  I'm looking at it.
*  It's about time to really fix the system that we have.
*  It's a system that's not working for the majority of American.
*  We are not represented.
*  But it sounds like what you're saying is the system is already broken.
*  And the only way to fix it is to break it more.
*  No, I don't believe in breaking.
*  I believe in building the destruction is not my intention here.
*  I mean, I cannot tell you how sad and disheartening that I have to do this.
*  Because that is the last thing I want to do.
*  To basically say, I know I told you the last time.
*  Biden is not the best, but he is not Trump.
*  And please, please vote for him.
*  And now I'm telling you, refrain because maybe, maybe, they would start seeing us as a human being deserving of a living.
*  Terry really sees this election in very stark terms.
*  It's not just about November.
*  It's about the future of her party.
*  But when it comes to the future of her party, she's basically a single issue voter, right?
*  I mean, the Supreme Court climate change, those things just don't matter to her as much as this other issue, the Palestinian issue.
*  And she's willing to risk all of that in this election for that issue.
*  Right.
*  So I think Terry would turn that right around and say that it's President Biden who is taking the risk here.
*  From her perspective, he is the one who is willing to lose the election over his continued support for Israel.
*  I am conflicted to the tilt.
*  But my political engagement, my being in the system, is not as important to me as saving the children that are dying.
*  I know.
*  Terry, thank you so, so much.
*  Thank you.
*  Pleasure.
*  Thank you.
*  Pleasure.
*  Pleasure.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you so much, Terry.
*  So Jenny, it really seems like the fight that Terry and Bob are having, you know, this conflict inside their marriage,
*  is a lot like what's happening inside the Democratic Party right now.
*  I mean, these are the battle lines, right?
*  And the question is, what does this mean for the election?
*  Like how many Terry's and how many Bob's are there out there?
*  Whose view is going to prevail?
*  And who's going to win?
*  Exactly.
*  We really don't know.
*  And the Michigan primary is really the first test of all of this.
*  The organizers of the uncommitted campaign say they're hoping for something like 10,000 votes,
*  which is roughly how much Clinton lost the state by.
*  But that's actually quite a small number because we've always seen some percentage of uncommitted in a Michigan primary.
*  So for this to really make an impact for it really to worry the Biden White House,
*  we'd probably need to see something with tens of thousands of votes.
*  And Michigan is not the only place we're going to see this play out.
*  There will be similar debates, I think, in Georgia, in Pennsylvania, maybe even other swing states.
*  And really no matter what happens, regardless of whether Terry's or the bombs prevail in this election,
*  the truth is the fight in the Democratic Party is really just beginning.
*  This is going to have a profound impact on the party.
*  Younger voters attitudes towards Israel is very different and they are becoming a bigger voting force.
*  So the politics are changing and that has the potential to really reshape America's decades-long
*  foreign policy in the Middle East.
*  Jenny, thank you. Thank you so much.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what I'll tune in to know today.
*  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.
*  On Monday, the Supreme Court heard arguments in two first amendment cases, challenging laws in
*  Florida and Texas, which aimed to limit internet companies' ability to moderate content on their
*  platforms. The platforms do not have a first amendment right to apply their censorship policies
*  in an inconsistent manner and to censor and de-platform certain users. I welcome your questions.
*  Lawyers for the States defended the laws, saying that big internet companies and the platforms
*  they run are essentially public forums and therefore should not be allowed to discriminate
*  based on political views. For example, against conservatives.
*  She interferes with editorial discretion. It compels speech. It discriminates on the basis
*  content, speaker, and viewpoint. Lawyers for the tech companies that own the social media sites
*  say that it is unconstitutional under the first amendment to force companies to publish views
*  against their will. The cases are likely to shape the future of speech on the internet.
*  Rulings are likely to come this spring. And Manhattan prosecutors on Monday asked a judge to
*  approve a gag order seeking to stop former president Donald Trump from attacking witnesses
*  or exposing jurors' identities in a case involving hush money Trump allegedly paid to a porn star.
