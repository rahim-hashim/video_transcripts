# Can India Become the Next Global Superpower?

*  Hey everybody, it's Sabrina.
*  Before we get started today, I just wanted to let you know that our colleagues over at
*  the run-up have started releasing their second season.
*  The show is hosted by Asdeh Hernden, and every week it dives deeply into questions about
*  American politics.
*  Like this week's show, it's a two-parter featuring back-to-back interviews, first with my pillow
*  CEO and election denier, Michael and Dell, and then with R&C Chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel.
*  These conversations give us a look inside the two opposing wings of the Republican party,
*  as they jostle for control going into next year's elections.
*  So that's the run-up.
*  They do a great job.
*  They make a great show.
*  Find them wherever you listen to us.
*  And subscribe.
*  Okay, here's today's show.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverny C, and this is the Daily.
*  The title of world's most populous country is expected to change later this month.
*  For the first time in at least three centuries, China is no longer the world's most populous
*  country.
*  India is in fact the brink of hitting a breathtaking milestone.
*  This month, India overtook it.
*  Alongside its population of 1.4 billion, India's geopolitical and economic footprint is also
*  growing.
*  Today, Alex Trevelli, the Times's South Asia business correspondent, explains what that new
*  status means for India's future.
*  And whether India will be able to use it as China once did, to become an economic superpower.
*  So what does this mean when it comes to the influence of India on the global economic
*  stage?
*  I mean, could it surpass China?
*  It's Thursday, April 27.
*  So Alex, you've been covering the economy in India for many years now.
*  And I really wanted to talk to you because something kind of remarkable has happened,
*  which is that India has overtaken China as the world's most populous country.
*  According to the UN, there are upwards of 1.4 billion people in each country with India
*  now bit ahead.
*  And so all of this kind of begs the question, will India be the next China?
*  That is really the question, Sabrina, that is being asked by so many people.
*  I think more outside of India and China than inside of them, but we're feeling the pressure
*  here too.
*  Will India be China?
*  Well, they have this incredible thing in common in terms of their population, their next-door
*  neighbors.
*  They both have ancient histories.
*  And a lot of these broad strokes are much more like than any other country in the world
*  is like either.
*  But as anyone who's visited these places know they're utterly different.
*  They're almost literally worlds apart.
*  But there's kind of motivation here to seeing India become China or become like China in
*  some ways.
*  And that's because of the meaning that China has taken on for the rest of the world since
*  1990.
*  Since 1990, China has turned its enormous population, the sort of scale that that represents as a country,
*  as a national economy, to its advantage in a way that was pretty much unimaginable before.
*  They turned all of these people into low-cost labor, to transform China into becoming the
*  factory of the world.
*  And in so doing, there's been, by almost any measure, the greatest production of mass
*  wealth over these past 30, 40 years from the Chinese economy that has ever been measured
*  anywhere in the history of the world.
*  The number of people who were deeply impoverished in the China of 1990, people who are now enjoying
*  middle-income lives, measured by a global standard, were talking about hundreds of millions of
*  people.
*  And that's not only a terrific reduction in poverty, such as India should hope to achieve for
*  itself, India is still being barely a lower middle-income country.
*  This is also what made China an indispensable part of the world economy.
*  Right.
*  And there are various factors around the world right now that have a lot of countries
*  and companies rooting for India to displace China as a location for production, as a new consumer
*  class, as a new geopolitical force between the Ukraine war, between COVID responses, between
*  tensions ramping up over the tech industry in Taiwan.
*  There is a lot of hope in some quarters, certainly, that India might become the next China.
*  In all of these big world-shaking ways.
*  Okay, so what's the answer?
*  Will India become the next China?
*  Like will they be able to leverage their huge population in the way that China did?
*  Okay, I don't have a crystal ball, but there are big, big differences between India and
*  China.
*  And some of these differences, three of them I'm thinking of in particular, make us question
*  whether India could ever become something like China, whether there is any other China,
*  but China.
*  And for a start, India's economy is just not shaped at all the way that China's is, that
*  China's was in 1990.
*  In fact, it's not even shaped the way that industrializing economies that we've seen in the past,
*  before China's astonishing success were structured.
*  So tell me more about that.
*  At the simplest level, there are not enough good jobs in India.
*  That's not to say Indians are sitting around without jobs or unemployed in great numbers,
*  but they don't have the kind of jobs that you'd need to catch up with China, to catch up
*  with the kind of growth rates that India wants.
*  Now, you've got an unusually, most people would say unhealthily large reliance on the services
*  part of the economy.
*  And then you have this traditionally very large part of the economy devoted to agriculture.
*  And then you've got the industrial or manufacturing sector, but that is relatively small.
*  And it's not been growing.
*  It's been stuck around 14, 15% of the economy for a long time.
*  China's by contrast is almost twice as high.
*  And it creates a very, very different sort of economic dynamic.
*  So this relatively small proportion of manufacturing is a problem for India.
*  The reason is that manufacturing makes jobs.
*  The kind of jobs that bring broader base of income earning, which means better consumer spending
*  down the line.
*  It also tends to mean exports, which is great for the currency and India's trade balances.
*  There are very few countries in the world that have managed to swing quickly from being
*  poor agrarian societies to being middle income industrial powers, even high income.
*  And they pretty much all went this route with export-driven manufacturing taking the lead.
*  Now India, frustratingly, has kept that at the low constant rate, despite a lot of efforts
*  from a lot of different governments to hike up the mix of manufacturing.
*  And it's especially frustrating for India at this moment I would offer because we are
*  talking about the vast number of young people entering the workforce.
*  Meaning?
*  It's nominally bigger than China, right, in terms of population.
*  But actually the graph, the sort of curve of the population by age makes India look even more attractive
*  because it has a huge number of people in their 20s and in their 30s, somewhat fewer in their 40s.
*  And there are a lot of young people who are about to enter the workforce too.
*  China, by contrast, mainly because of that one child policy, has just gone into population decline.
*  And its population is going to be getting older.
*  India has workers, neither does it have too many children, nor does it have too many retirees.
*  You've really got a population profile that's perfectly aged to enter a bunch of great jobs.
*  And you don't have enough available.
*  Okay, so the problem is not enough jobs and in particular not enough manufacturing jobs.
*  Even though they have plenty of people to fill those kind of jobs, that's the problem right now in India.
*  So why then is it that India doesn't have a big manufacturing sector if they have the workers to fill it?
*  The biggest reason that India is not going to become China in terms of manufacturing right now is that China is China.
*  It's a very difficult competitor for India.
*  There's virtually no way to crack that market the way that there was when China walked in and took the crown.
*  That's really got to be the biggest problem.
*  But then there are other problems.
*  You look and see as labor in China has become more expensive as the country's got richer.
*  And as manufacturer, especially of lower value goods, have looked elsewhere,
*  they tend to find what they're looking for more easily in smaller countries, in Vietnam and Bangladesh.
*  And why is that?
*  Why are they more attracted to India?
*  Well, it's a million dollar question.
*  There are probably a few answers.
*  One is India is so big that it has a lot of competing interests.
*  It hasn't been able to just concentrate on like Bangladesh has garment assembly.
*  Okay.
*  In Bangladesh, business and government, everyone is lock step.
*  And we're going to be a world-beating garments manufacturer.
*  India has a lot of different competing interests.
*  So for example, when foreign companies come in like Amazon or Walmart,
*  often they're faced off in their own fierce competitions with other big local companies.
*  And then the local partners will go to town seeking advantage with the government
*  and the foreign company tends to find itself at a disadvantage.
*  Got it.
*  In other words, when a big foreign company wants to come in,
*  local Indian companies can kind of gang up against it like that?
*  Yeah, they can use their pull some companies with some connections, definitely have advantages.
*  And this is true of whole industries also.
*  But I want to say there are all sorts of signs that things are changing and rapidly.
*  In a country this size, there are so many things changing rapidly all the time.
*  It's hard to know with a stick.
*  But Apple made news just recently opening its first retail outlets in India.
*  Never mind the retail outlets though.
*  They are actually interesting and show signs of promise.
*  But what's really amazing is just how quickly Apple has moved some fraction of its production outside of China.
*  Just three years ago, I think it was that 98% of all iPhones in the world were being made in China.
*  India was making 1%.
*  Putting together the actual phone, they very, very quickly turned that up.
*  And last I looked this year, analysts think that India is producing 7% of the world's phone supply.
*  Big jump.
*  Another 1% for Brazil and all the rest still in China.
*  But it leads some people to say that India might have a quarter of that global market by the end of this decade.
*  There are at the same time shoe manufacturers that are bypassing Vietnam as they move from China to India around Chennai.
*  That's happening just now.
*  And the rapid progress, the rapid way in which the world's equation with China is changing makes it very hard to write off the possibility that India will gobble up a large chunk of that pie.
*  What we can't tell you right now is whether those are symbolic steps towards progress or if it's a wave coming.
*  Okay, so you said there were three big differences that matter between India and China.
*  What's the next big difference?
*  Okay, the next one is very striking.
*  Although it's a little bit hard to distinguish from the problem with jobs.
*  This is the fact that in India, far too few women are in the workforce.
*  Now, if you look at China, you've got more than 60% of all women of working age are in the formal workforce.
*  That's slightly more than in America.
*  And both of these countries are significantly above the world average.
*  One of the most daunting things about India's situation in the world at this time is that its rate is one of the very lowest in the world.
*  It's barely 20% of all working age women who are working.
*  20% is so low, right?
*  It's so low that there are only a few countries fewer than a dozen that have lower rates starting with Yemen, Libya, and a few countries around the Gulf.
*  There are no serious productive economies that have rates like that.
*  And especially if we're looking at the sort of scale effect that India's possibly enormous workforce is going to give it in decades ahead,
*  it simply can't advance in accordance with its numbers if women are no part of the picture.
*  So why exactly does India have so few women in the workforce?
*  Well, that's a very tricky question to answer and very important one to get right.
*  The fact is there are not enough women in the workforce now because there are not enough jobs for them.
*  But then the question is why are there not enough jobs for women?
*  It's a bit of a chicken in the egg puzzle.
*  Right.
*  If there are simply not enough jobs in the workplace,
*  and at every level of society starting with the family, women enjoy a lower status,
*  then they're going to be the part of society that's last to enter the workforce.
*  And they're going to enter at the lowest value end of it.
*  Women are working like mad in this country, but they're working on farms, they're working in homes,
*  they're working in peace work that doesn't get picked up by the economic measures of formal employment.
*  So that means that India's workforce, its total stock of jobs,
*  would need to increase many times before we started to really pick up that very, very low,
*  20-some percent rate of female participation in the workforce.
*  Right.
*  So in other words, women are last in line for formal jobs.
*  That's right.
*  They're last in line for formal jobs, and it looks like a very, very long line.
*  But that's not the only reason that we don't have lots of women working in the formal economy.
*  There's this other amazing fact, and it's kind of disheartening.
*  The richer India has gotten, the rate of women in the workforce has actually gone down.
*  Not up.
*  You'd expected to go up.
*  It went up in these other countries we're looking at.
*  So the rate of women working has gone down, not up, as India's gotten richer.
*  Why is that?
*  Well, we don't really know.
*  There are competing explanations.
*  Some of them take into account various cultural factors.
*  One thing right off the bat is that for some families,
*  it's regarded as being prestigious to have a woman working at home, or at least it's the
*  opposite of prestigious to have her out working in the market.
*  So once a family can afford to keep a woman at home, whether she's a wife, mother, daughter,
*  they might pressure her to instead do work at home and stay away from the grubby
*  marketplace.
*  Right.
*  At the same time, it's very clear that the role of women in society has been improving in many ways
*  in India.
*  It's gotten better in that women are filling up colleges and universities, earning degrees
*  at almost the same rate that men are, and many important parts of the education ecosystem.
*  But that's not really the part that's going to make up the bulk of the workforce.
*  Got it.
*  What's the third and last difference between India and China here?
*  Well, that would be the political transformation underway in India.
*  This is a big one, and it's kind of a wild card.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So politics.
*  So India is of course a hugely different place than China politically.
*  It's the biggest democracy in the world.
*  China is not.
*  Talk to me about that difference, and why that difference matters when it comes to their
*  economies.
*  Okay.
*  Well, let's talk about India and China as two independent sovereign nations.
*  As it happens, they both started life at about the same time, 1947, 1949.
*  Let's say as the People's Republic of China.
*  And they've been totally different ever since.
*  India is the world's biggest democracy.
*  China, apart from not being a democracy, has this consolidated communist authoritarian state.
*  So it's just a very different process.
*  It has a different process for making decisions, gathering information, executing decisions.
*  And that matters because when making big, painful decisions and imposing them on the country,
*  a government like China's has a much easier time and acts with much greater speed.
*  So for instance, what we used to call land reform was a very important part of China's economic
*  development generation or two ago.
*  That meant going to the landlords with biggest states, breaking up their properties and
*  handing them off to peasants.
*  That required a government acting with a decisiveness and brutality that's very hard to
*  muster in a democracy.
*  Today, the spirit is much less one of land reform than of commissioning highways,
*  dams, infrastructure projects, or just setting aside land for a factory.
*  In China, the People's Republic is theoretically the owner of all land in the country.
*  It can just decide what to do and it gets done.
*  In India, politicians are falling down all over the place trying to weadle bits of land that
*  will be useful for whatever kind of development priority and it takes them forever to do so.
*  Hmm.
*  Cannot steamroll the same way.
*  Yeah, not at all the same way.
*  I mean, look, in 1979, China more or less invented Shenzhen, which was then a dismal
*  little village next to Hong Kong.
*  Now it's a city of, I think, 17 million.
*  It's one of the most expensive and prosperous in the whole country.
*  India also has what are called special economic zones, but they're the size of villages.
*  They're in the middle of nowhere.
*  You can hardly name the biggest one.
*  There's no shunjun being invented by the government snapping its fingers.
*  Right.
*  And labor laws, for instance, are equally malleable in the hands of Chinese leadership.
*  996, that is for blue collar and white collar workers alike, working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
*  6 days a week is a norm in the most bustling parts of China.
*  You won't find that anywhere in India, except where all kinds of laws are being broken.
*  And those are not pretty places.
*  Okay.
*  So India's political reality for decades, and really since it's modern founding, right?
*  In an economic context is just much harder than China's.
*  Yeah.
*  But we now have an Indian government under Prime Minister Modi that is more ambitious than any
*  that's come before it, at least for generations.
*  And what it's trying to do is really remake India in a whole lot of ways.
*  What they never quite say, but what a lot of people suspect is that
*  India's leadership has been very impressed with what China has done over the past 30 years.
*  And that Mr. Modi is very envious of what Shijun Ping is able to do.
*  And he is at any rate, whatever the inspiration, consolidating power,
*  like no Indian leader has, at least since the 1970s.
*  For instance, state governments in India are very powerful. Mr. Modi has made it a priority
*  for his party to win as many state governments as possible.
*  When they can't win them, they often buy the opposition politicians so that they change party.
*  And his party ends up controlling those state governments anyway.
*  And there are other sneakier things that are nonetheless, at this point, quite obvious.
*  A lot of the courts make judgments that are very favorable to Mr. Modi's government.
*  A lot of newspapers are owned by businessmen with whom he's friends.
*  A lot of institutions that sit outside of those spaces find themselves subject to special police
*  raids to having foreign funding cut off to being shut down.
*  The traditional checks on executive power in India are falling away.
*  It's certainly, despite its continuing elections, got a lot of the hallmarks of
*  country that's becoming less democratic, less indecisive in the way that democracies are.
*  So Prime Minister Modi is essentially trying to reshape Indian politics to give more power
*  to the central government, to give more power to himself and his party.
*  Which would look more and more like China, right?
*  But is reshaping the Indian government to look more like China's going to work?
*  I mean, at least in terms of its ability to control the economy?
*  Well, there's one more factor that we have to add.
*  One more part of the new India, as envisioned by Mr. Modi, that we have to take into account.
*  And that makes India very different than China.
*  The program, the ideological program that Mr. Modi and his colleagues come to power with
*  sees the Hindu population of India.
*  It's 80, some percent majority, as being the primary India.
*  And in particular, the Muslim population, which is the largest minority, about 14% of the country,
*  is being shown its way to second-class status.
*  Now, that presents all kinds of problems.
*  India is a much more diverse country than China at that ethnic level.
*  So, re-envisioning India as an ethno nation, that is a very hard thing to imagine.
*  It opens the door to an unknown, which we don't have in the Chinese case.
*  So you're saying that part of Modi's ideology is, of course, the centralization of power,
*  but also advancing a Hindu nationalist vision for India, despite what that might mean for the economy.
*  Yes, I think, despite what that might mean for the economy, although Prime Minister Modi and his
*  champions might say that there's no reason to think that it's going to pose any problem to the
*  economy. After all, the state which he governed before he came to govern all of India,
*  had tons of problems between the Hindu majority and the Muslim minority.
*  And yet, its economy is boomed throughout with really admirable GDP growth.
*  And now, liberals have decried the rise of Hindu primacy and the degradation of some minorities as
*  they see it. But it's not yet clear that that's an economic hurdle as such.
*  There's a comparison you might draw to the position of the weakers and Kazakhs and other Muslim
*  minorities in China's Xinjiang region, who have been quite horribly and obviously persecuted
*  in a number of ways. But that represents a tiny fraction of 1% of China's population.
*  In the Indian case, we're talking about an aggrieved minority, which adds up to something more like
*  one in six, one in seven of all Indians. Oh, so much, much bigger. It's a much bigger minority.
*  And the number of aggrieved citizens that you're making as you embark on this project is just much
*  greater. It's a different kettle of fish entirely. Okay, so it's possible Modi's commitment to a Hindu
*  ethno state and making Muslim second class could represent a kind of unknown vulnerability. But it's
*  also possible that it wouldn't have a negative impact on the economy, right? Like, yes, bad for
*  democracy. No, not necessarily bad for the economy. That, I think, is certainly the case. It is
*  the case, in other words, that we don't know what effect that'll have on the economy. And I think
*  frankly that when America, its State Department, its business interests look at India, hopefully as a
*  possible partial replacement for China. They don't want to think about these questions to do with
*  the state of India's democracy or India's minorities. They're content to concentrate on economic
*  progress, the rebuilding of the infrastructure, a lot of old hurdles being overcome, and set aside
*  the questions about political liberties and the nature of the democracy. We don't really know how
*  those are going to affect the economy. I just want to flag that it's a great big unknown. India's
*  changing in this way. It's changing from its script to the past 75 years. And that opens the
*  door to all kinds of uncertainties. Right. So that's why you said earlier that India's politics really
*  is a wild card. Yeah, exactly. So Alex, all of these factors that you've outlined kind of make
*  me think that we already know the answer to the question we posed at the top, which was will India
*  be the next China? And the answer, it feels like to me, is no, right? Well, yeah, I think that's true.
*  There's a lot of reason to think that India will not be the next China. In fact, when you look at
*  either these countries or both of these countries in a much detail, the question seems almost absurd.
*  But I want to say for all these two countries having common and for all they don't have in common,
*  the world is no longer 1990. So nobody is going to do what China did starting in 1990. India is not
*  going to do that in 2023, nor would it want to. The world is a fundamentally different place now
*  than it was those 33 years. And in a lot of ways, for better and for worse, from India's point of
*  you. Now, for one thing, becoming the world's factory is no longer quite the brass ring that it
*  was back then. Manufacturing is the less important part of the world than it was in 1990.
*  The shape of the world is different. In fact, services, which we sometimes look down on because many
*  of them are low down the food chain, used to be the case you couldn't export any of them.
*  There are very different part of the world economy than they used to be. The prospect of Indians
*  doing tons of work for the rest of the world, both from India and abroad, sending home remittances,
*  is much more plausible now than it would have been a generation ago. The internet has made that
*  possible and the shrinking work forces and the developed economies to use just a couple of examples.
*  And it's got this extremely what they call an aspirational class of young people who want to go
*  abroad, who want to do these service type jobs. And you've got a lot of entrepreneurs also who are
*  very good at chiseling out niches around the world's economies. So I think it's fair to say India
*  is not going to follow the tracks laid by China. And I think that is seeming clearer to me every year.
*  But that's not to say that it will not experience tremendous growth. In fact, it may very well experience
*  tremendous growth. We've got to hope so. Those hundreds of millions who have yet to leave some level
*  of poverty, those many, many millions of young people who need better employment, they all need India
*  to grow, to grow quickly. There's not a lot of time to waste. But whatever form of growth
*  India's takes, it will be its own thing. Like China, India will be big, important when India shakes
*  a leg, the world will feel it. Of that I'm convinced. We just don't know what shaped the country will
*  be like, but we can say with some confidence it won't be just China all over again.
*  Alex, thank you. Thanks, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. On Wednesday, the House narrowly passed a Republican bill
*  to raise the debt ceiling and cut government spending in an effort to force President Biden to
*  negotiate over slashing the budget or risking a debt default. The legislation would raise the
*  debt ceiling into next year in exchange for a nearly 14% cut in Biden's landmark spending programs.
*  The action was largely symbolic. The bill will not pass the Democratic Lids Senate,
*  but it was seen as an effort by Republicans to strengthen their negotiating position over the debt
*  limit. Without action by Congress to raise the limit, the US government faces a default as early
*  as this summer. And Disney sued Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, claiming he had used his power to punish
*  the company after it had opposed legislation in Florida that banned classroom discussion of
*  sexual orientation and gender identity. The lawsuit filed in federal court made a first amendment
*  claim, accusing DeSantis of a, quote, relentless campaign to weaponize government power against Disney
*  in retaliation for expressing a political viewpoint.
