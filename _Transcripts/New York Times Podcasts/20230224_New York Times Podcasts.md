*  My name is Igor Luzenko.
*  I am 44.
*  I am a reconnaissance specialist in Ukrainian army in one of the military bases, not far
*  from the frontline now.
*  During the first stage of war in February and March, you just go and meet a lot of people
*  and you try to talk to everyone to be friends with everyone who you see because you have
*  an emotional need to speak to someone.
*  And the operators of the mortars were very nice guys and we became close with them.
*  And we lost the contact for a couple of weeks and when we tried to ask where the mortar
*  guys are, I remember the eyes of one of the persons from that unit.
*  We didn't talk a shatter, we just looked at each other and we understood that we know
*  our friends died.
*  We don't have to use some words, we just shared the same grief just with the side with
*  each other.
*  Then I decided that the time when you are trying to be friends with everyone who you see
*  in your position is just better not to know much about them.
*  Now I have a rule not to be so close friends with people on war because if you lose your
*  close friends, if the marshmallow pieces and if you lose just your war mates.
*  So it's kind of a way to protect yourself from more grief than you already have.
*  In the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernice and this is the Daily.
*  For much of the past year, the war in Ukraine was mostly defined by Ukrainian success.
*  In battle after battle, Ukraine had unexpectedly and improbably kept winning.
*  But now a year in, that momentum has slowed.
*  Russia has hit back, throwing tens of thousands of draftees at the Ukrainian front lines, causing
*  casualties on both sides to soar and forcing Ukrainians to come to terms with a new reality.
*  That the war is unlikely to be over anytime soon.
*  Today, I talk to Ukrainians about the ways that the war has changed their lives.
*  It's Friday, February 24th.
*  Hello.
*  Hi, Maximey Tsubrina.
*  How are you doing?
*  Hi, Tsubrina.
*  I'm Mel and how are you?
*  Good.
*  Good.
*  So Maximey, could you introduce yourself for me?
*  Okay.
*  My name is, as you know, Maximey.
*  My nickname is Maus.
*  I'm 44 years old and before the war, I was a lawyer and had my own practice and I lived
*  in the same city.
*  Now it's a new year.
*  Wow.
*  And what about your family?
*  Do you have a wife, kids?
*  Yeah, I have a wife.
*  I have two kids.
*  My daughter is 22 years old and my junior son is 11 years old.
*  Oh, 11.
*  I very miss him.
*  My bad.
*  What's his name?
*  Mikhail Michael.
*  Michael.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh.
*  Maxime, tell me about your recent military experience.
*  On the military service, I became in April of 2022.
*  When I came to Zami, I have no experience.
*  The experience in this case, that's why I must learn a lot of new things for me.
*  But as I know right now, I have a good practice in this.
*  So you joined the military and you've been fighting.
*  Where has the battle been most intense?
*  It was the beginning of December.
*  We spent a couple of days already in the forest, near Kremlin.
*  And for that day, it was a couple of days, maybe two or three days, when Russian forces
*  were trying to capture us.
*  Fifteen on us was on duty.
*  It was in the forest.
*  It was a hole in the earth.
*  A hole in the earth?
*  Yeah.
*  We call it the Blindash.
*  So it's a military shelter?
*  Yeah, yeah, correct.
*  And when I was a soldier, who was on duty, so the couple of Russian soldiers came in
*  on our position.
*  And they screaming, Russians, Russians, we didn't expect that they came to our position
*  so close.
*  So, I was 13 meters on scene.
*  And they started shooting on us.
*  We started shooting on them.
*  In that time, I just tried to make my job and try to stay alive.
*  I didn't think about nothing.
*  They started to fall down.
*  Some of them was killed, most screaming, just falling down the ground, the soul.
*  Life is over.
*  Another part of them continued to shoot on us.
*  After that, way after way after way.
*  They continued to move, move, move, shoot and move.
*  They didn't try to hide from the fire, our fire.
*  Like zombie.
*  For me, it was, I'm an actor in horror movie.
*  I don't feel that it's real.
*  And all of these continents, quite a long time, two and a half hour.
*  That's just unbelievably long for a firefight.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  We lost 95% of our munitions.
*  If you ran out of ammunition and the Russians captured you, what would you do?
*  Kill myself.
*  Kill myself with the grenade.
*  You were prepared to do this?
*  At that time, yes.
*  And after that fight, we continued to look around us.
*  We were waiting another group of Russian soldiers.
*  But it's ended.
*  They didn't come.
*  Yeah.
*  Just he as cream, helped, helped a couple of minutes.
*  Russian soldier was dying.
*  And that's all.
*  After that, it was full silence.
*  Only wind in the forest, in the trees.
*  You know, sometimes I still hear this scream.
*  And it was helped, helped, helped in Russian, in the dream.
*  A couple of times.
*  It was a nightmare.
*  I heard the sound.
*  I heard his scream.
*  And I wake up.
*  It's not a very usual thing for a human being to kill a chisel, for normal human being.
*  Do you think the war will be over soon?
*  No.
*  Maybe I've run.
*  No, I hope I am wrong.
*  Did you think the war would be over soon at the beginning of it when it first started?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  What made you change?
*  The war.
*  The house looked like.
*  And what did I saw?
*  Maybe I opened my eyes.
*  Maybe I understand something about war.
*  It will be a most, most happy man in the world if this war ended tomorrow.
*  For example.
*  Yeah.
*  And even from the week or months, I don't know, but soon.
*  But I understand it.
*  I'm unreal.
*  Maxine, thank you for talking to me.
*  You're welcome.
*  Hello.
*  Hi.
*  Hi, Ira.
*  How are you doing?
*  Hi.
*  Can you hear me?
*  I can hear you.
*  I can hear you.
*  And Ira, can you introduce yourself?
*  I am Ira Nazibuk.
*  I am from Kiev.
*  And I have 24 years old.
*  Now I am very not far from Bachmut.
*  Do you know about Bachmut?
*  I do know about Bachmut.
*  Are you on the front lines in Bachmut?
*  Yeah, but not exactly in the Bachmut, but near.
*  On the front line near Bachmut.
*  And I am the paramedic on the cause of our creation.
*  We are exactly the team that going to the front line and taking the person is in
*  yours from that place where it happened.
*  And I am in my car right now.
*  So now I'm just trying to be quiet to listen what is going on outside.
*  Ira, do you hear fighting?
*  Is there fighting happening now?
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  Yes.
*  I'm just waiting for the commander and for his tasks.
*  If somebody will have injuries, we will have work.
*  Ira, remember back for me to a time when you saved someone's life.
*  Tell me that story.
*  This is, you know, like many stories and nothing special.
*  But I guess there was this person who like,
*  injure on the right hand.
*  It was from the like drawn.
*  Yeah, so he has like really huge here injures with the many,
*  many, many, many of that part of the bombs, you know, in his hands,
*  a massive bleeding.
*  And we just help him to the hospital.
*  But after that he write me, do you remember me?
*  You've located me.
*  So however you I just want to have a video call with you.
*  And I said, man, no, not today, no video calls.
*  I just immigrated you know, I saw that maybe he wants to have like communication with me.
*  And I don't like such things.
*  So that's why I still don't know him.
*  No, no worries.
*  See you.
*  Take care and blah, blah, blah.
*  So what he said, please I'm very asking you, you need to have a call.
*  Video call with me.
*  And I said, oh my god, okay, just for a minute.
*  And he said, yes, okay, just for a minute.
*  And he called me and he said, I need to show you somebody.
*  And he showed me his daughter, six years old daughter.
*  She's like a very tiny girl and she was just smiling to me.
*  And she just said, I miss Ira, I just want to tell you, thank you for my,
*  that you saved the life of my father.
*  And that was my very strong moment.
*  Sometimes here in the world, everything is very depressive.
*  But in that moment, all my sadness, tiredness is like just gone.
*  And I'm just like staying there and feel that I can, I know why I'm doing this.
*  And I can do more and more and stay for how much that guys need me.
*  When I remember the story, I just feel like I have a sunshine inside of me.
*  Wow.
*  You know, after all this months of the war, I just really feel like I don't have emotions like enough.
*  This is something that was me and I really don't like it.
*  I just want to stay that person to take up what happened before the war.
*  Very easy going. I had every Friday night with my friends that we were with drink, wine.
*  And it was perfect life.
*  I loved myself and I loved everything that going on with everything.
*  With my boyfriend, with my life, with my job, with the Friday nights.
*  And it was the person I loved, it was me.
*  And I don't know if it's clear right now to understand, but I'm telling you this and I'm smiling right now because that was crazy, perfect life.
*  Now I just want to come back and to feel the same, to feel all these perfect things from a living life.
*  That's why I love this life.
*  And I just sometimes feel very lonely because of this because I come back to my parents' cities where I had a lot of friends and we had coffee together.
*  And I said to my mom, I said here, you know, I just don't know.
*  I can ask somebody to go with, you know, to have a coffee with me because everybody is dying.
*  You said to your mom, how can I ask somebody to have coffee with me? Everybody's died.
*  You mean because so many of your friends had died?
*  Exactly, yes.
*  And I just don't know who I can ask for this.
*  About how many of your friends died in this war, Ira?
*  If we can say from the 2014, I guess it can be 16 person.
*  16?
*  Yes.
*  Oh, you're that's a lot of people.
*  Yes, that's something that hard me the most in this war.
*  Yeah.
*  This is the feeling like people of my age.
*  This is very hard to explain the feeling that I lose my youngest.
*  Yes, I know what I know good for it.
*  Feeling that you lose your youth.
*  Yes, my youngest, yeah.
*  Yes, you're right.
*  Okay, just a moment.
*  Just like me, answer my commander.
*  Yes.
*  It sounds like you need to go.
*  Yeah, I'm very sorry, but I need to say to my team that we will have on your desk.
*  Got it.
*  Ira, thank you so much for talking to me.
*  It's nothing good, like.
*  Bye.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Hello.
*  Hi, Olga, it's Sabrina.
*  Hi, hello.
*  Sabrina, hello.
*  Hi, hello.
*  Hello.
*  So, Olga, let's begin.
*  Tell me your name, your age, and where you are right now.
*  My name is Olga Brzul, and I'm 40 years.
*  I'm currently based in Vienna, because, as you know, Ukraine is still under Shelling.
*  And I gave a promise to my husband that I will protect our daughter.
*  She's nine years old.
*  Her name is Zaharia.
*  And he asked me to stay for a while somewhere in a safe place.
*  Got it.
*  Olga, I'm going to ask you some questions about Victor.
*  How did you meet you and Victor?
*  We actually meet on the first of January.
*  And it was a very funny story, because Victor called me.
*  We had mutual friends, and he got my number, but we actually haven't seen each other at all.
*  We just heard something about it.
*  And I even don't know.
*  I've asked him why he decided to call me.
*  I actually can't explain.
*  I just had the number and it all went up.
*  And just called, and like, hi, what about meeting?
*  I have some champagne, what about meeting?
*  I said that it's a joke.
*  And I said, yes, of course, he just came to my flat, and I was surprised, because I said that it was a joke.
*  And actually, yeah.
*  And like, we talked a lot, we loved a lot.
*  We were kids.
*  We were 23 years old.
*  And as usual, you need some time to understand that this guy is good for you, yeah?
*  But I was really surprised that we have so many common favorite things.
*  I mean, music, film, books, art.
*  And like, after that, we just started to meet each other.
*  And very fast, we actually started to live together.
*  And after eight years, I just asked, what are you thinking about having a baby?
*  Because like, eight years is quite long.
*  And he told me that I think that having babies is a very good idea.
*  And yes, we were very happy young parents, because like, it was kind of an adventure for us.
*  And tell me your occupation, your job before the war?
*  I'm actually a film creator.
*  I've organized film festival.
*  And Vita, he was a film editor on different artistic films.
*  And actually, it was quite strong blue for us.
*  It's like our...
*  How to say it?
*  Our air, yeah.
*  It was quite popular activity for us to spend our evenings
*  by discussing different films and our impressions.
*  And actually, sometimes we had different opinions.
*  And for us, it was quite, you know, usual thing to fight.
*  Because of the films.
*  We had a joke that normal families is usually fight trying to find proper refrigerator.
*  But we instead of fight to find the common impressions regarding the film.
*  But then, as you know, when the war started, Vita told that he would go to this military record in military services.
*  And he told me that, of course, he feels fear and it's normal.
*  But it's not like that point of history when he can wait and to hesitate.
*  And then he was sent to the war.
*  And after that, it's very important not to panic during the communication with your husband when he is at war.
*  Because it's quite difficult for them to stay there.
*  They don't sleep.
*  They can't eat normally.
*  They underpression all the time.
*  And when you explain to your husband that you are worried that you are an anxiety, that you can't sleep,
*  it doesn't help them to fight.
*  And actually, I also was trying to talk with him about books, literature, history, and especially films.
*  We have one favorite film which is called Apocalypse Is Now, which is made by Coppola.
*  And Vita told me that he definitely would have another impression of the film after this war experience,
*  that the film can express all that human being experienced in the war line.
*  And he told me that it's quite important for him to hear all these pieces of
*  like previous life, this peaceful life, because it helps him to believe that war is not only the reality in which he now exists.
*  Yeah.
*  And during this nine months in war, we only had one chance to see each other.
*  It was at the end of August.
*  I had my birthday.
*  I had my 40s.
*  Your 40s?
*  Yeah.
*  And asked Vita to find like a day or two to meet us.
*  And we met in Rivena.
*  I came from Vienna.
*  We spent two, three days together.
*  And it was a very happy moment in my life, because I took my daughter.
*  And it was actually our last meeting.
*  It was 20s of August.
*  It was sunny and warm, beautiful day.
*  And I was in the bus when I saw him and my daughter is a hardy, so he actually ran to him and hug him.
*  He was with this flower, with this sun flower, you know, with this our traditional flower.
*  And he was in his military form.
*  And we were very, very happy.
*  And that's actually, it was a little bit difficult, because like, you all the time want to cry,
*  but you can't, because you don't want to cry during these three days.
*  Like, because you don't know when you will have this meeting will happen again.
*  And so we went to the park, we played with our water lots.
*  And then actually, we also went to the cinema, of course, because,
*  I forgot for us, it's important because cinema is a part of our life.
*  And watched a very strange entertainment film, because as usually we watch our art house films,
*  but at that moment, it had no matter what kind of film we, for us it was a desire to catch this feeling of our normal life before the Russian invasion.
*  And it was a little bit surrealistic feeling that, you know, the ordinary life is surrounding you,
*  kids, young families, teenagers, and among all these normal realities you and your husband in a military form,
*  you know that war is going on, but in this part of Ukraine you can't feel it, because it's not on the frontline.
*  And only the sounds of sirens somehow reminds you that it's war.
*  Right.
*  And there was like counting all the time, the minutes and hours to the end of our meeting,
*  because I knew that we had two and a half days, and you know, the time ran very fast.
*  Yeah.
*  And then it was December, it was cold, it was difficult, but he told me that he's trying to be strong,
*  that he's really believed that he will come back home, that he will hold me in the harrier,
*  that I should believe that he will come back.
*  And sometimes he even apologized that he can't support me at this moment, that he had to be on the war.
*  He never told me anything about the chance of his death.
*  He always told me that he will come back, and here promised me that everything will be okay in the future,
*  that I have to believe in this.
*  So, 30th of December, I wrote him in the morning and didn't receive anything.
*  And during the whole day I was sending him messages, he said, please send me this,
*  just something, tell me, because you do not answer me.
*  And I had this terrible feeling that maybe something happened.
*  And then in the evening I got a call from a soldier, and he told me that the waiter died,
*  because he even said that he died because of this missile attack.
*  When I got this call, it was maybe the most terrible and terrifying call in my life.
*  I had also to tell this news to my daughter, then to Vita's parents, to my parents, to Vita's sister.
*  And on the first of January we celebrate our anniversary.
*  So, like in today's we should celebrate this 17 year anniversary.
*  And now I will never have new year anymore.
*  I think I will never have this celebration again.
*  And next day I got this message.
*  Vita sent his friend Sasha message when he was alive.
*  When Vita was on the front line on the south of Ukraine.
*  And in this message Vita asks Sasha to tell me and the Harrier that Vita loves.
*  He always will be with us.
*  That he actually was right to go to the front line and to defend Ukraine.
*  And that he asks Sasha to tell me that Vita loves me because he can't send this message to me.
*  You know, they're not to make me panic, you know, because he's still all the time right to create the atmosphere that he will come back.
*  And next day I was in the train.
*  I was moving to Kiev to...
*  to...
*  to organize funeral and so on.
*  And we played his favorite songs with dance to relax.
*  It was like very crazy.
*  But I know that he wanted to have a party because in his Texas he also told me that when he come back there will be a good party.
*  And we will dance in order to recover after this shocking and bloody war.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  A new report issued Thursday by the National Transportation Safety Board confirmed that the derailment of a Norfolk Southern train in East Palestine, Ohio, carrying hazardous chemicals,
*  was caused by a wheel bearing that overheated.
*  The train derailed earlier this month and the hazardous gases on board were burned off to avoid the threat of an explosion.
*  Since then, federal and state officials have said tests have found the water and air to be safe to breathe and drink.
*  But residents continue to report an array of lingering symptoms and have questions about whether it will be safe to continue to live there in the long term.
*  And former film producer Harvey Weinstein was sentenced to 16 years in prison Thursday for committing sex crimes in Los Angeles.
*  He'll serve the sentence on top of the 23 year term he received in New York in 2020.
*  Thursday's sentencing all but insures the 70 year old will spend the rest of his life in prison.
*  Today's episode was produced by Claire Tennis-Sketter, Shannon Lynn, Rob Zipco, and Nina Filman.
