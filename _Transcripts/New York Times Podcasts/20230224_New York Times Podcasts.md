# A Year of War in Ukraine
**New York Times Podcasts:** [February 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHY36oDnhyc)
*  My name is Igor Lutsenko. I am 44. I am a reconnaissance specialist in the Ukrainian
*  Army in one of the military bases not far from the frontline now. During the first stage
*  of war in February and March, you just go and meet a lot of people and you try to talk
*  to everyone, to be friends with everyone who you see because you have an emotional need to
*  speak to someone. And the operators of the mortars were very nice guys and we became close with them.
*  Then we lost the contact for a couple of weeks and when we tried to ask where the mortars guys,
*  I remember the eyes of one of the person from that unit. We didn't talk to each other, we just
*  looked at each other and we understood that we know our friends died. We don't have to use some
*  words, we just shared the same grief just with the side with each other. Then I decided that
*  that time when you are trying to be friends with everyone who you see in your position,
*  it's just better not to know much about them. Now I have a rule not to be so close friends with
*  people on war because if you lose your close friends, it's much more pity than if you lose
*  just your war mates. So it's kind of a way to protect yourself from more grief than you already have.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi and this is The Daily.
*  For much of the past year, the war in Ukraine was mostly defined by Ukrainian success. In battle
*  after battle, Ukraine had unexpectedly and improbably kept winning. But now, a year in,
*  that momentum has slowed. Russia has hit back, throwing tens of thousands of draftees at the
*  Ukrainian front lines, causing casualties on both sides to soar and forcing Ukrainians to come to
*  terms with a new reality, that the war is unlikely to be over anytime soon. Today,
*  I talk to Ukrainians about the ways that the war has changed their lives.
*  It's Friday, February 24th.
*  Hello.
*  Hi, Maksim, it's Sabrina. How are you doing?
*  Hi, Sabrina. I'm well and how are you?
*  Good. Good. So Maksim, could you introduce yourself for me?
*  Okay. My name is, as you know, Maksim. My nickname is Mouse. I'm 44 years old and before the war,
*  I was an LOR and have my own practice and I live in the same city where I am now. It's Dnipro.
*  Wow. And what about your family? Do you have a wife, kids?
*  Yeah, I have a wife. I have two kids. My daughter is 22 years old and my junior son,
*  he is 11 years old. I very miss him.
*  I bet. What's his name? Michael.
*  Michael. Yeah.
*  Maksim, tell me about your recent military experience.
*  In the military service, I became in April of 2022. When I came to the army, I have not a lot
*  experience in this case. That's why I must learn a lot of new things for me. But as I know right
*  now, I have a good practice in this.
*  So you joined the military and you've been fighting. Where has the battle been most intense?
*  It was the beginning of December. We spent a couple of days already in the forest near Kremlin.
*  Before that day, it was a couple of days, maybe two or three days when the Russian forces
*  were trying to capture us. 15 of us were on duty. It was in the forest. It was a hole in the earth.
*  So it's a military shelter. Yeah, yeah, correct. And when our soldier
*  who was on duty saw a couple of Russian soldiers coming on our position.
*  And they're screaming Russians, Russians. We didn't expect that they came to our position so close.
*  30 meters unseen. And they start shooting on us. We start shooting from them. In that time,
*  I just trying to make my job and trying to stay alive. I didn't think about nothing.
*  They started falling down. Some of them were killed. No screaming. Just falling down on the ground.
*  That's all. Life is over. Another part of them continued to shoot on us.
*  After that, way after way, way after way.
*  They continued to move, move, move, shoot and move. And didn't try to hide from the fire, our fire.
*  Like a zombie. For me, it was... I'm an actor in a horror movie. I don't feel that is real.
*  And all of this continues quite a long time. Two and a half hours.
*  That's just unbelievably long for a firefight. Yeah, yeah. We lost 90-95% of our ammunition.
*  If you ran out of ammunition and the Russians captured you, what would you do?
*  Kill myself.
*  Kill myself with a grenade. You were prepared to do this?
*  At that time, yes. And after that fight, we continued to look around us.
*  We were waiting for another group of Russian soldiers.
*  But it's ended. They didn't come. Yeah.
*  I just hear a scream. Help, help. A couple of minutes. Russian soldier was dying. And that's all.
*  After that, it was full silence. Only wind in the forest, in the trees.
*  You know, sometimes I still hear this scream. It was, help, help. Help, help in Russian.
*  In the dream. A couple of times. It was a nightmare. I heard this sound. I heard his scream.
*  And I wake up. It's not very usual thing for human being to kill each other. For normal human being.
*  Do you think the war will be over soon? No. Maybe I'm wrong. No, I hope I'm wrong.
*  Did you think the war would be over soon? At the beginning of it? When it first started?
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What made you change?
*  The war. How it looked like. And what did I saw? Maybe I opened my eyes.
*  My eyes.
*  Maybe I understand something about war.
*  I will be a most, most happy man in the world if this war ended tomorrow, for example.
*  And even from the week or month, I don't know. But soon.
*  But I understand that it's unreal.
*  Maxim, thank you for talking to me. You're welcome.
*  Hello. Hi. Hi, Ira. How are you doing? Hi, can you hear me? I can hear you. I can hear you.
*  And Ira, can you introduce yourself? I am Irina Tsibuk. I am from Kiev. And I have 24 years old.
*  Now I am very not far from Bakhmut. Do you know about Bakhmut? I do know about Bakhmut.
*  Are you on the front lines in Bakhmut? Yeah, but like not exactly in the Bakhmut, but very near.
*  On the frontline near Bakhmut? And I am the paramedic on the
*  cause of evacuation. We are exactly the team that going to the frontline and taking
*  the person's insurance from that place where it happened. And I am in my car right now. So now
*  I'm just trying to be quiet to listen to what is going on outside. Ira, do you hear fighting? Is
*  there fighting happening now? Yeah, for sure. Yes. I'm just waiting for the commander and for his
*  tasks. If somebody will have injuries, we will have work. Ira, remember back for me to a time
*  when you saved someone's life. Tell me that story. This is, you know, like many stories and
*  nothing special. But I guess there was this person who like injured on the right hand.
*  It was from the drone. Yeah, so he has like really huge injuries with the many, many, many
*  of that part of the bombs, you know, in his hands. Massive bleeding. And we just help him to the
*  hospital. But after that, he write me, do you remember me? You evicted me. So how are you? I
*  just want to have a video call with you. And I said, man, no, not today. No video calls. I just
*  evocated you. You know, I saw that maybe he wants to have like communication with me and I don't
*  like such things. So that's why I told him, no, no worries. See you. Take care and blah, blah,
*  blah. So what he said, please, I'm asking you, you need to have a video call with me.
*  I said, oh my God, okay, just for a minute. And he said, yes, okay, just for a minute. And he
*  called me and he said, I need to show you somebody. And he showed me his daughter, six years old,
*  daughter. She's like very tiny girl. And she was just smiling to me. And she just said,
*  hi, Miss Ira, I just want to tell you thank you for my, that you saved the life of my father.
*  And that was, oh my God, very strong moment.
*  Sometimes here in the war, it's, everything is very depressive. But
*  in that moment, all my sadness, tiredness is just gone. And I'm just like staying there and feel
*  that I can, I know why I'm doing this and I can do more and more and stay for how much that guys
*  need me. When I remember the story, I just feel like I have a sunshine inside of me.
*  You know, after all this months of the war, I just really like feel like I don't have
*  emotions like enough. So this is something that war did with me and I really don't like it.
*  I just want to stay that person that I have been before the war.
*  Very easy going. I am like, had every Friday night with my friends that we, where we drink
*  wine. And it was, it was perfect life. I loved myself and I loved everything that going on
*  with everything with my boyfriends, with my life, with my job, with the Friday nights. And it was,
*  it was the person I loved. It was me.
*  And I don't know if it's clear right now to understand, but I'm telling you this and I'm
*  smiling right now because that was crazy, perfect life. Now I'm just want to come back and to feel
*  the same, to feel all these perfect things from living life. This is, that's why I love this life.
*  And I just sometimes feel very lonely because of this, because I come back to my parents cities
*  where I have had a lot of friends and we had coffee together. And I said to my mom, I said,
*  you know, I just don't know how I can ask somebody to go with, to have a coffee with me because
*  everybody's died. You said to your mom, how can I ask somebody to have coffee with me? Everybody's
*  died. You mean because so many of your friends had died? Exactly. Yes. And I just like,
*  don't have, don't know whom I can ask for this. About how many of your friends died in this war
*  era? If we can say from the 2014, I guess it can be 16 person. 16. Yes. Oh, yeah, that's a lot of
*  people. Yes. Yes. That's like something that hurt me the most in this war. Yeah.
*  This is the feeling like people of my age, this very hard to explain, like feeling that I lose
*  my youngest. Yes. I don't know how I love it for it. Feeling that you lose your youth. Yes, my
*  youngness. Yeah. Just a moment. Okay. Just a moment. Just let me answer my commander. Yes.
*  Okay. It sounds like you need to go. Yeah, I'm very sorry, but I need to
*  send to my team that we will have a new task. Got it. Eera, thank you so much for talking to me.
*  It's nothing. Good luck. Bye.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Hello? Hi, Olga. It's Sabrina. Yeah. Hi. Hello, Sabrina. Hello. Hi. Hello. Hello. So, Olga,
*  let's begin. Tell me your name, your age and where you are right now.
*  My name is Olga Birzul and I'm 40 years. I'm currently based in Vienna because, as you know,
*  Ukraine is still under shelling. And I gave a promise to my husband that I will protect
*  our daughter. She's nine years old. Her name is Zaharia. And he asked me to stay for a while
*  somewhere in a safe place. Got it. Olga, I'm going to ask you some questions about
*  Victor. How did you meet you and Victor? We actually met on the first of January.
*  And it was a very funny story because Victor called me. We had mutual friends and he got
*  my number, but we actually haven't seen each other at all. We just heard something about it.
*  And I even don't know. I asked him why he decided to call me. He told me that I actually
*  can't explain. I just had your number. And they told me why not. And just called. And like,
*  hi, what about meeting? I have some champagne about meeting. I thought that it's a joke. And
*  they said, yes, of course. He just came to my flat. And I was surprised because I thought that
*  it was a joke. And we talked a lot. We loved a lot. We were kids. We were 23 years old. And
*  as usual, you need some time to understand that this guy is good for you. But I was really
*  surprised that we have so many common favorite things. I mean, music, film, books, art.
*  And like, after that, we just started to meet each other. And very fast, we actually started to live together.
*  And after eight years, I just asked, what are you thinking about having a baby? Because like,
*  eight years is quite long. And he told me that I think that having a baby is a very good idea.
*  Yeah. And yes, we were very happy young parents because like, it was kind of an adventure for us.
*  And tell me your occupation, your job before the war.
*  I'm actually a film curator. I organized film festival. And Vitya, he was a film editor on
*  different artistic films. And actually, it was a quite strong glue for us. It's like our,
*  how to say it, our air. Yeah. It was quite popular activity for us to spend our evenings
*  by discussing different films and our impressions. And actually, sometimes we had different opinions.
*  And for us, it was quite, you know, usual thing to fight because of the films. We had a joke that
*  normal families as usual fight trying to find proper refrigerator. But we, instead of it,
*  fight to find the common impressions regarding the film. But then, as you know, when the war started,
*  Vitya told that he would go to this military, recruiting military services. And he told me that,
*  of course, he feels fear and it's normal, but it's not like that point of history when he can
*  wait and to hesitate. And then he was sent to the war. And after that, it's very important not to
*  panic during the communication with your husband when he's at war, because it's quite difficult for
*  them to stay there. They don't sleep. They can't eat normally. They're under pressure all the time.
*  And when you explain to your husband that you are worried, that you are in anxiety, that you can't
*  sleep, it doesn't help them to fight. And actually, I also was trying to talk with him about books,
*  literature, history, and especially films. We have one favorite film, which is called Apocalypse Now,
*  which is made by Coppola. And Vitya told me that he definitely would have another impression of
*  the film after this war experience, that the film can express all that human being
*  experienced in war line. And he told me that it's quite important for him to hear all these pieces of
*  previous life, this peaceful life, because it helps him to believe that war is not only the reality
*  in which he now exists. And during these nine months in war, we only had one chance to see each
*  other. It was at the end of August. I had my birthday. I had my 40th. And I asked Vitya to
*  find like a day or two to meet us. And we met in Rivne. I came from Vienna. We spent together three
*  days. And it was a very happy moment in my life because I took my daughter. And it was actually
*  our last meeting. It was the 20th of August. It was a sunny and warm, beautiful day. And I was in
*  a bath when I saw him and my daughter, Zahara, I saw him. Actually, we ran to him and hugged him.
*  He was with this flower, with this sunflower, you know, this our traditional flower. And he was in
*  his military form. And we were very, very, very happy. But actually, it was a little bit difficult
*  because like you all the time want to cry, but you can't because you don't want to cry during
*  three days. Like because you don't know when this meeting will happen again. And so we
*  went to the park. We played with our daughter a lot. And then actually, we also went to the cinema,
*  of course, because for us it's important because cinema is a part of our life. And
*  watched a very strange entertainment film because as usually we watch our art house films.
*  But at that moment, it had no matter what kind of film. For us, it was
*  a desire to catch this feeling of our normal life before the Russian invasion.
*  And it was a little bit surrealistic feeling that, you know, the ordinary life is surrounding you.
*  Kids, young families, teenagers, and among all this normal reality, you and your husband
*  in a military form. You know that war is going on, but in this part of Ukraine, you can't feel it
*  because it's not on the front line. And only the sounds of sirens somehow remind you that it's war.
*  Right. And I was like counting all the time, the minutes and hours to the end of our meeting,
*  because I knew that we had two and a half days. And as you know, the time ran very fast. Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And then it was December. It was cold. It was difficult. But he told me that he's trying to be
*  strong, that he really believes that he will come back home, that he will hold me in the hurry,
*  that I should believe that he will come back. And sometimes he even apologized that he can't
*  support me at this moment, that he had to be on the war. He never told me anything about
*  the chance of his death. He always told me that he will come back. And he promised me that everything
*  will be okay in the future, that I have to believe in this. So, 30th of December,
*  I wrote him in the morning and didn't receive anything. And during the whole day, I was sending
*  him messages, Peter, please send me this plus, just something, tell me, because you do not answer me.
*  And I had this terrible feeling that maybe something happened. And then in the evening,
*  I got a call from a soldier. And he told me that he died.
*  Because he is, I even can say that he died because of this missile attack.
*  When I got this call, it was maybe the most terrible and terrifying call in my life.
*  I had also to tell this news to my daughter, then to Vita's parents, to my parents,
*  to Vita's sister. And on the 1st of January, we celebrate our anniversary. So like in two days,
*  we should celebrate the 17th year anniversary. And now I will never have New Year anymore.
*  I think I will never have this celebration again. And the next day, I got this message.
*  Vita sent his friend, Sasha, a message when he was alive, when Vita was on the front line
*  on the south of Ukraine. And in this message, Vita asks Sasha to tell me and Zahary that Vita
*  loves us, that he always will be with us, that he actually was right to go to the front line and to
*  defend Ukraine. And that he asks Sasha to tell me that Vita loves me because he can't send this
*  message to me in order not to make me panic, you know, because he still all the time tried to create
*  the atmosphere that he will come back. And next day,
*  I was in the train, I was moving to Kiev to organize funeral and so on. And we played his
*  favorite songs, we danced, we hugged. It was like very crazy. But I know that he wanted to
*  have a party because in his taxes, he also told me that when he come back, there will be a good
*  party and we will dance in order to recover after this shocking and bloody war.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. A new report issued Thursday by the National Transportation
*  Safety Board confirmed that the derailment of a Norfolk Southern train in East Palestine, Ohio,
*  carrying hazardous chemicals, was caused by a wheel bearing that overheated. The train derailed
*  earlier this month and the hazardous gases on board were burned off to avoid the threat of an
*  explosion. Since then, federal and state officials have said tests have found the water and air to
*  be safe to breathe and drink. But residents continue to report an array of lingering symptoms
*  and have questions about whether it will be safe to continue to live there in the long term.
*  And former film producer Harvey Weinstein was sentenced to 16 years in prison Thursday for
*  committing sex crimes in Los Angeles. He'll serve the sentence on top of the 23-year term
*  he received in New York in 2020. Thursday's sentencing all but ensures the 70-year-old
*  will spend the rest of his life in prison. Today's episode was produced by Claire Tennis-Getter,
*  Shannon Lin, Rob Zipko, and Nina Feldman. It was edited by Liz O'Balen with help from Lisa Chow,
