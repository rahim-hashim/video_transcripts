# The Legal Strategy Behind the Latest Trump Indictment
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdZ8yjeQMEk)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, to win a conviction against Donald Trump for trying to subvert the 2020 election,
*  special counsel Jack Smith is applying laws in ways they've never been used before.
*  My colleague Charlie Savage has been studying last week's indictment to better understand
*  Smith's legal strategy and the ways that Trump may try to counter it.
*  It's Tuesday, August 8th.
*  Charlie, welcome back.
*  We like to turn to you as The Times' in-house legal mind after indictments because you make
*  sense of them.
*  Well, thank you.
*  It's lovely to be back.
*  I want to start by talking about the legal strategy behind this latest indictment of
*  former President Trump and its strengths and its weaknesses.
*  When this indictment came out last week, the first thing we all noticed about it was how
*  it was structured.
*  Just to remind listeners, it does not this indictment lay out a bunch of charges and
*  then evidence that would back up those charges.
*  Instead, it just tells one big long story about what Trump did in his efforts allegedly
*  to overturn the 2020 election and says, trust us.
*  This grand story means he committed all these alleged crimes.
*  I want to start there.
*  What that structure tells us about the legal strategy behind this indictment.
*  I do think that we can infer some insights into what strategy Jack Smith is developing
*  here from the structure of this indictment.
*  You're right that it is not the standard indictment where you have a few discrete actions and
*  then that's attached to one charge and then there's some different actions and that's
*  attached to a different charge.
*  It is a long narrative about all the myriad ways that Trump and his accused co-conspirators
*  tried to engineer a way for him to stay in power despite losing the 2020 election.
*  It says that entire narrative of fraudulent electors in the different states pressuring
*  the Justice Department to say there was fraud when they weren't seeing it, pressuring Mike
*  Pence to disrupt the counting of Biden's electoral votes on January 6 and so forth.
*  All of that adds up to three different criminal statutes from which they have four counts.
*  The same set of facts are being looked at from each of these criminal perspectives.
*  It's like the entire narrative can be charged this way, can be charged that way, is chargeable
*  this other way and so they're putting everything into these different pots rather than breaking
*  it up into discrete segments.
*  Got it and just remind us how this grand narrative, this one big story in the eyes of Jack Smith,
*  the special counsel merits the charges that are included in it.
*  So the three statutes that are charged, conspiracy to defraud the government, conspiracy to obstruct
*  an official proceeding and then closely related actual obstruction and attempted obstruction,
*  and then finally a conspiracy to disenfranchise voters are all different ways of looking at
*  the same story.
*  They're independent criminal lenses to bring upon the same set of actions.
*  For example, recruiting slates of fraudulent electors to send to Washington and appear
*  alongside the actual state certified electors that Biden won from these swing states like
*  Georgia, Arizona and so forth.
*  One way of looking at that is this was defrauding government.
*  This was saying these are legitimate electors even though they had not been chosen through
*  the official procedures, they had not been certified by the governors, but they were
*  showing up and purporting to be something they were not.
*  The fact that they were showing up and the idea was that Pence would either count them
*  instead or use their presence as an excuse to stop the proceedings and the stuff back
*  to the states was going to obstruct, disrupt, impair Congress from getting through its joint
*  session to count the electoral votes.
*  So it's obstruction of an official proceeding conspiracy.
*  And the fact that people in those states had voted for Biden and had sent legitimate electors
*  certified by those governors to go vote for Biden and cast their electoral college votes
*  in that direction was going to be impaired by the fact that these other people were showing
*  up and their actual legitimate chosen representatives in the electoral college were not going to
*  be able to complete the election by casting their votes for Biden.
*  So it is a conspiracy to disenfranchise the voters who had participated in that election.
*  The same thing is criminal in Jack Smith's argument here.
*  Three or four different ways, and he's bringing them all in parallel.
*  So what exactly should we infer about the special counsel's overarching legal strategy
*  based on this decision, quite deliberate, of using the same story to undergird each
*  of these charges?
*  There's a phrase that lawyers use sometimes called built in suspenders, which is there's
*  different ways to keep your pants from falling down.
*  You could put a belt on, you could put suspenders on, maybe you put them both on.
*  And then if one fails, the other is still there.
*  And that's, I think, inferrable as one of the strategic choices that Jack Smith has
*  made here.
*  This is an unprecedented situation.
*  We have never had a conspiracy to disrupt the electoral college so that someone who
*  lost a presidential election gets to stay in power anyway.
*  Therefore, there is no precedent for bringing these statutes to this situation.
*  We don't know how courts are going to interpret it.
*  We don't know what jurors are going to do with it.
*  We don't know if appeals courts, the Supreme Court may have second thoughts if there's
*  a verdict that's under review.
*  And there's complexities raised by all of them.
*  And so by bringing the same set of facts in four different ways under three different
*  criminal statutes, Jack Smith is creating redundant layers as a safety net.
*  He's got suspenders, he's got a belt, he's even got some duct tape holding those pants
*  up so that if something collapses at some point down the process, the risk that the
*  whole thing collapses goes down.
*  In a way, it sounds like you're saying, Charlie, that the special counsel anticipates
*  based on the novelty of this case that one of these charges, maybe even two of these
*  charges might not survive, maybe in the courtroom or on appeal.
*  And he is going to make sure that there are options throughout each phase of this case
*  so that something is left at the end to, he hopes, charge and convict Donald Trump.
*  I think that's right.
*  I mean, I don't think he would have brought any of these charges if he didn't think that
*  most likely in his head, at least, a jury will convict and it will be sustained on appeal.
*  But as a matter of legal and political reality, there's a chance that there's a holdout juror
*  on one or two of them, there's a mistrial on those charges, or that an appeals court
*  decides that this statute just wasn't written for this purpose and is stretched too far
*  and they throw out a guilty verdict on this one or that one.
*  The more lenses he's bringing to bear on this, the more likely that one of them is sustained
*  through the end of the process and he wins a conviction that is the final result.
*  Aaron Norris Charlie, if this is intended to be an all-encompassing
*  legal strategy full of layers and belts and suspenders, I'm curious about what was left out
*  of this indictment, why Jack Smith chose not to charge Trump with some things we have heard
*  about a lot since January 6th, one of them being incitement, the other being sedition
*  related to what happened at the Capitol. And those were charges you might have expected
*  to have been brought against Trump if they were brought against people who showed up at the Capitol
*  that day. What's your understanding of why the special counsel didn't choose to use them in his
*  built-in suspenders approach? Jack Smith
*  So you're absolutely right that the other striking thing about the structure of this indictment is
*  what's missing from it. And what's missing from it is not just charges on incitement or
*  insurrection or seditious conspiracy, but actually large amounts of evidence about the violent events
*  minute by minute that happened on January 6 itself. Stuff that is dozens and dozens of pages in
*  the House January 6th Committee report is just not here even though it's obviously available evidence.
*  And the January 6th Committee had recommended charging Trump with inciting the violence and
*  with a sedition and yet Jack Smith didn't do so. So obviously, I don't know why Jack Smith for sure
*  didn't do that. He's not talking to me. But I think we can infer that the reason is that is a sticky
*  wicket for several reasons. The first of which is the First Amendment. Trump gives this inflammatory
*  speech, but at the same time, there's elements of it that are ambiguous. He's saying, you know,
*  peacefully protest or something at one point, even though every other point seems like he's
*  there to tell them to fight like hell or they're not going to have a country anymore, etc. Right.
*  And when you're going to charge someone with inciting a riot or inciting an insurrection
*  or something like that, inciting violence, unlawful violence, you have to meet a really high bar
*  because of the First Amendment. The speech has to be directed to or inciting or producing imminent
*  lawless action and likely to incite or produce such action. And Trump would have an awful lot
*  to argue about. And his defense team would have an awful lot to argue about if that was the focus
*  of the trial. They could point to all the ambiguous components of his speech where he never actually
*  say go riot. He said go show them, you know. And on top of that, the government has already charged
*  oath keepers and proud boys defendants with planning the violence ahead of time. And in some
*  cases already down at the Capitol and starting to raise havoc with the cops at the barricades
*  as Trump was still giving his speech. And so the defense could talk about that too. What do you
*  mean he decided the riot? The violence was already happening and the people who were the leaders of
*  the violence had planned days ahead of time to do that. And you've charged that in court, haven't
*  you? How can you say this speech that Trump gave caused that? Right. So that is a weaker area for
*  Jack Smith to take his case into. Again, he hasn't told me what he's thinking, but from just talking
*  to lots of criminal law experts on the outside of what is going on here, he stayed away from the part
*  that would have been relatively weaker and could have jeopardized his larger case. But all that said
*  about belts and suspenders and so forth, it's clear that this is a novel case. This is an unusual
*  situation with charges that have not been tested in this context before. And there are going to be
*  ways that Trump and his defense team can attack it. We'll be right back.
*  Charlie, let's talk through Donald Trump's potential avenues of defense against this
*  indictment and the charges that it contains and evaluate their potential strengths and weaknesses.
*  Sure. Well, one set of defenses that his lawyers have already made clear they are playing with and
*  are likely to mount centers on the First Amendment. Trump had a right to say these things to the
*  public. He had a right to say these things to Pence. You can't criminalize free speech,
*  political speech. Jack Smith seems to anticipate this defense. And in the indictment, he opens
*  with a rebuttal to it. There's an unusual preamble in the indictment that reads like the opening
*  statement a prosecutor would bring in trial. He says, look, Trump had every right to object
*  to the election results. He had every right to file lawsuits challenging them. He had every right
*  to say what he wanted about them. He even had a right to lie about them. But what he didn't have
*  a right to do were these unlawful actions aimed at impeding, obstructing, disenfranchising and so
*  forth. And this is where things get complicated. First of all, in the realm of the things coming
*  out of Trump's mouth, I think we have to distinguish between his public speech and his
*  private speech. Public speech being what is he saying on Twitter? What's he saying at rallies?
*  That's one thing. Private speech being what is he saying to Republican officials? What's he saying
*  to the Secretary of State in Georgia when he says, got to find me 12,000 votes? What is he saying to
*  the Attorney General of the Justice Department when he's saying, I want you to just say that you see
*  fraud here, even if you don't? And what's he saying to Vice President Pence when he's saying,
*  I want you to not count these Biden electors or throw it back to the states. And you're too honest
*  if you think you can't do that. And so you have a free speech in this country, but you don't have
*  the right to solicit a crime. So the private speech Jack Smith is framing as something that's
*  not protected by the First Amendment. He's soliciting crime. Yep. But where this gets
*  extra complicated is Jack Smith spends a lot of time in this indictment talking about what Trump
*  was saying publicly. He says at one point that it was integral to his criminal plans. He was
*  creating the atmosphere of public suspicion in which this effort to engineer a reversal of the
*  election was going to take place. He was creating tremendous pressure on these Republican officials
*  by stoking anger at them among Republican voters. And so Jack Smith, it seems to me,
*  is a little bit trying to have this both ways in terms of the right to say these things publicly
*  and whether that's what's being included in the criminal offense or not here. And I don't know
*  what's going to happen as that plays out in pre-trial or in the trial itself. Okay, I want
*  to make sure I understand this. The speech emanating from Donald Trump that seems most legally problematic,
*  the private speech, the time he calls up the Secretary of State of Georgia or Mike Pence and
*  says do something that might ultimately be illegal in this indictment that is mingled with
*  the public speech emanating from Trump. You know, him telling the public that he won the election
*  when he didn't, that feels more legally protected, less legally problematic. You're saying Jack Smith
*  contends that both of these forms of speech are in the service of a conspiracy. And in the end,
*  that might create an opening for Trump to wage a potentially successful First Amendment defense.
*  The fact that these are both in this indictment and treated as legally problematic.
*  I think that's right. You know, I guess if Jack Smith were on the podcast with us here, he would
*  say, well, look, if Trump had only said these things publicly and hadn't privately tried to
*  engineer fraud, disenfranchisement, obstruction, then we wouldn't be here. But he did. And they
*  are relevant to the criminal action that is charged here. Right. He might say you can't
*  really disentangle these two forms of speech. I think he does. In fact, he says they were
*  integral to his criminal plans. So that's potential defense. Number one, First Amendment. What's
*  the next potential Trump defense? So the most difficult and most interesting defense centers
*  around intent. Everyone agrees prosecutors are going to have to prove that Trump had
*  the requisite criminal intent to be convicted of these crimes. What you're thinking, what your
*  motive is, is a crucial element of whether you committed the crime. And this gets complicated.
*  We have heard a lot of people say, for example, well, if Trump really believed that he had won
*  the election, if he had deluded himself into thinking the only way he could have possibly
*  lost was through voter fraud. This was clearly a rigged election. And therefore, his efforts to
*  fight the certification of Joe Biden's Electoral College victory to overturn those results in
*  those states that he had convinced himself he must have actually won, could not have been corrupt.
*  It was undertaken with good intentions. He was trying to fix a problem, protect democracy,
*  not destroy democracy. The kind of delusion defense. If he didn't believe he'd lost,
*  then how could he possibly be guilty of having criminal intent? That's right. Is that a strong
*  defense for Trump potentially? Well, it turns out that we already know what happens when people in
*  this context raise that defense because a number of January 6 rioters who have already been
*  prosecuted have gone to the judge and said, I lacked corrupt intent when you've accused me
*  of obstructing that joint session of Congress because I genuinely believed Trump had won the
*  election. And it has not worked. Judges have said, it doesn't matter whether in your own head,
*  your motive was pure here because you committed other crimes to advance that goal. In their case,
*  you committed trespassing, you assaulted cops, you vandalized government property.
*  These things are illegal. You knew those were illegal. And so the fact that you believed Trump
*  won the election was irrelevant to that. So how does that apply to Trump? Trump obviously himself
*  did not trespass on the Capitol, punch a cop, break a window. But according to Jack Smith's
*  indictment here, he did commit simultaneously other crimes en route to obstructing that
*  proceeding. He conspired to disenfranchise voters. He conspired to defraud the government.
*  And so in that way, this indictment we've been talking about that has one story that's charged
*  many different ways is also interwoven with itself. These other crimes are necessary
*  for corrupt obstruction to be met, even if the jury or at least one member of the jury is not
*  convinced that Trump knew he was lying about everything. So Trump's lawyers might spend a lot
*  of time trying to establish for the judge and the jury in this case that he really believed
*  everything he was doing was right. He believed he lost. He believed he was a patriot clinging
*  to power because he deserved to. But at the end of the day, a judge, a jury might treat him the same
*  way it has the January 6 rioters and say, that doesn't matter. It's not relevant because you
*  committed other crimes along the way. If Judge Chutkin, the judge assigned to this case,
*  responds to that argument in the same way that judges in the District of Columbia have been
*  responding in the rioter cases, she would issue an instruction to the jury that tells them,
*  if you think Trump committed other crimes along the way, that is enough to show corrupt intent,
*  regardless of what he personally believed. Got it. Is there anything else that Trump might
*  argue in his defense against this indictment? Let me add just one more third. This is the advice
*  of counsel defense. There are situations in which a person who is genuinely ignorant of the law
*  consults a lawyer. The lawyer says, oh, you can do X. And it turns out the lawyer is wrong.
*  And the person will then say, you cannot accuse me of committing this crime because I didn't
*  intentionally break the law. I was relying in good faith on the counsel's advice. Therefore,
*  I didn't intend to do anything bad. I did not have bad intentions. I was trying to obey the law.
*  Just listening to my lawyers. Just listening to my lawyer, doing what the options were that that
*  person told me. So here, Trump had a ton of lawyers who worked for the government in the White House
*  telling him this can't be done. This is crazy. This violates the Electoral Count Act. The vice
*  president doesn't have the authority to unilaterally pick who won the presidential election.
*  This is illegal. But he had a lawyer, John Eastman, who was telling him what he wanted to hear,
*  which was this is totally you can do this. Here's my theory. It works. Let's do it. So can Trump
*  point to John Eastman's advice and say, I'm not a lawyer. Here's a respected lawyer. This used to
*  be respected now facing disbarment proceedings. How was I to know? Now there's going to be
*  challenges here. One is there are limits on when you can successfully invoke the advice of counsel
*  defense. The client has to have told the lawyer all the relevant facts. The theory has to be
*  reasonable. And so in a situation when lots of other lawyers, serious government professional
*  lawyers who are on your team, politically appointed lawyers, are saying this is not a
*  reasonable theory, can you just march through until you find somebody who tells you what you
*  want to hear that would undermine the effectiveness of this defense, perhaps in the minds of the jury?
*  I know this involves a little bit of guesswork on your part, but based on your reporting,
*  do you anticipate that Trump will make multiple defense arguments so that he has his own set of
*  belt and suspenders? If one of these defense arguments fails, he can rely on another.
*  Absolutely. That is a common defense strategy. Throw everything against the wall and see what
*  sticks. I think we can anticipate that everything we've been talking about here, the defense will
*  throw at it, both in motions to dismiss before the trial and then at the trial, assuming there is a
*  trial, and in appeals after the trial, if there's a guilty verdict, all these arguments will come
*  back and be recycled again and again, and probably some others that we haven't thought of yet,
*  just to see if something, somewhere gets traction. You've now done this kind of legal analysis after
*  each one of the indictments brought against Trump. In the past few months, there are now three of them.
*  Of course, the one involving hush money payments in New York, the classified documents case brought
*  by Jack Smith in Florida, and this 2020 election case brought by Jack Smith in Washington.
*  This case is talked about as by far the most important and consequential of those three
*  indictments. And that makes me wonder if, based on your reporting, it is seen as the strongest case
*  legally. So I think there's two ways of thinking about that. And I'm especially thinking about this
*  case, the election case, and the documents case, also a federal case brought by the special counsel.
*  In terms of the law and the facts, it seems pretty clear that the documents case is stronger. It is
*  simple. It is using a statute that has been used before, is tested, and there's just lots of evidence.
*  There's cooperating witnesses, there's surveillance video, there's boxes on photographs,
*  there's text messages. So that's a very easy case to make to a jury. Whereas the election case,
*  as we've discussed, is these statutes that weren't quite written with this situation in mind,
*  never been tested against this situation because this situation has never arisen before.
*  All kinds of complexities about intent and these defenses that we've talked about, which makes it
*  relatively more complicated and a harder sell to a jury. On the other hand, there are factors outside
*  of the four corners of these two indictments that cut the other way. The documents case is assigned
*  to a judge who has a conservative background that Trump appointed and who in the past, famously,
*  has ruled in his favor in ways that were later overturned because they were so outlandish. And
*  the jury pool in Florida will be drawn from people who live around Palm Beach County and Fort Pierce,
*  relatively a lot of Republicans there who may be sympathetic to Trump and may be therefore more
*  skeptical, looking for ways to have reasonable doubt or at least a hung jury. The election case
*  was assigned to a Democratic appointed judge appointed by Obama with a liberal background
*  who has been one of the toughest sentencers against January 6 rioters, Tonya Tuchkin,
*  perhaps the worst judge that Trump could have drawn. If he got maybe the best judge he could
*  have drawn in Florida and the worst judge in D.C. And D.C. is a place where there's lots of Democrats
*  relatively speaking to South Florida and therefore a jury pool that may be less inclined to be
*  sympathetic to this particular defendant. And so that may make this case stronger.
*  You have just laid out some real serious cross currents.
*  That's right. And that's how this gets complicated. Your question is, is this the strongest case?
*  Jack Smith has clearly tried to make this as strong a case as he can. But in the end,
*  it comes down to the facts, the law, the evidence, the defense, the judge, and the jury.
*  Charlie, once again, thank you very much. My pleasure.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. On Monday, one of America's largest trucking companies,
*  Yellow, filed for bankruptcy, a decision that will lead to the loss of about 30,000 jobs
*  and create potentially serious disruptions to the country's supply chain.
*  Yellow, a 99-year-old company, is involved in about 50,000 shipments a day and recorded revenue
*  of more than $5 billion last year. But it took on enormous debt from a series of mergers,
*  became embroiled in a prolonged labor dispute with its unionized workers, and during the pandemic,
*  needed a $700 million loan from the U.S. government to stay afloat. It's now unclear whether that loan
*  will ever be repaid. Today's episode was produced by Mujzadeh, Olivia Nath, and Michael Simon-Johnson
