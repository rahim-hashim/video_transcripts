*  My name is Nick Casey.
*  I'm a writer for the New York Times magazine.
*  Mexico is in the middle of a war against drug traffickers.
*  But there's a second conflict there that you might not know about.
*  It's a war to silence Mexico's free press.
*  Last year, Mexico was one of the deadliest places in the world for journalists to work.
*  Second only to Ukraine.
*  One journalist have faced phone hacks, death threats, beatings, torture, and in one case,
*  a pair of grenades launched at their newsroom.
*  Because no one has figured out how to protect journalists where they work, Mexico is resorted
*  to the extreme step of hiding reporters in safe houses across the country.
*  What's behind these threats is pretty simple.
*  Many of the reporters under threat were investigating the government that was supposed to protect
*  them.
*  Many in the government for years have been on the payroll of Mexico's drug cartels.
*  Now imagine you're a reporter in Mexico.
*  How do you do your job when you can't distinguish between the crime fighters and the criminals?
*  Is this prosecutor I'm speaking to involved with a crime that I'm reporting?
*  And what will he do to me for writing about it?
*  It's a hall of mirrors.
*  In Mexico, you're on your own.
*  This week's Sunday read is my story about a local newsroom in Mexico called the Michoacán
*  Monitor.
*  The Monitor was a small news outlet, just one editor and a few of his friends, and they
*  decided to investigate corruption in their city government.
*  Soon they started getting threats.
*  And as you'll hear in this story, some of these threats became real.
*  But these did not deter Armando de Nadez, the editor and chief of the monitor.
*  And so even after the photographer of the monitor was murdered outside the newsroom by two
*  masked salons, de Nadez took to Facebook live to address the killing.
*  In the broadcast, a visibly shaken de Nadez sits alone in front of a microphone.
*  His phone, a pen and a reporter's notebook sit on the table.
*  The Michoacán Monitor team has been suffering a series of death threats.
*  Today these threats were carried out and one of our members was murdered today.
*  A few minutes ago, they made an attempt on his life.
*  He lost his life a few minutes ago.
*  That's the way it is at the Michoacán Monitor.
*  I can't talk much.
*  I can't say much.
*  All I can do is tell our colleagues' family that we're not going to lead things like
*  this.
*  We're going to take things to the bitter end.
*  We're not armed.
*  We don't have weapons.
*  Our only defense is a pen, a pencil, and a notebook.
*  The Facebook live continues, and Linadez says that he knows who was behind the killing.
*  He goes on to say that he's going to continue to report on corruption despite someone being
*  killed in his newsroom.
*  It's a spectacular decision.
*  This wasn't the first small newsroom to be attacked this way in Mexico.
*  Clearly this means the end.
*  Everyone goes into hiding.
*  But with Linadez, you have the case of someone who was just so grounded in what he did and
*  what he believed in the power of journalism to change things in a democracy that he decided
*  he wasn't going to leave and he wasn't going to give up.
*  In the end, at the Monitor, you're talking about ordinary reporters with little money
*  or protection.
*  People who thought they could make a contribution by exposing corruption in their town.
*  But what they came up against was something much bigger and much more armed than they
*  were.
*  So here's my article.
*  Who hired the hitmen to silence Cetacuo?
*  Recorded by Anthony Ray Paris.
*  On October 19, 2021, Armando Linadez Lopez was writing up notes from an interview when
*  his cell phone buzzed with a non-known number.
*  Linadez, 49 in stocky with black hair that was just starting to show grey streets, ran
*  an online news site in a small Mexican city called Cetacuo.
*  He knew his beat so intimately that calls from unfamiliar phone numbers were rare.
*  But the man on the other end, spoken away that was instantly familiar.
*  Linadez had come to know that pitched menacing tone from years of run-ins with every kind
*  of Mexican gangster.
*  This is Commander Eagle, the voice-end.
*  I'm from the Halleys School, New Generation, Gertel.
*  Cetacuo, in the hills of the state of Mijrakan, had for years mostly been known for its fertile
*  avocado orchards and the pine oak forest where tourists came to see the annual arrival of
*  the monarch butterflies.
*  But its central location had made it increasingly attractive to the jug trade.
*  Linadez grew marijuana and opium poppy, the source of heroin, in nearby mountains.
*  And in recent years, international drug cartels had been using Mijrakan as a way station
*  for methamphetamine and fentanyl shipments.
*  Linadez's rise as a journalist coincided with the drug loom, and he watched its devastating
*  effects on Cetacuo.
*  Severed heads dumped in front of a car dealership, business owners kidnapped for ransom, and
*  a government that seemed unwilling or unable to do anything about it.
*  If Mexico ever hoped to escape the violence that was devouring it, Linadez often said,
*  the press would need to pursue the politicians who enabled the crime.
*  And so in 2019, he and a few friends founded a new site called Mijrakan, publishing
*  it downstairs from a lot of office.
*  As the city's main and perhaps only, Mijrakan, Linadez quickly came to dominate the local
*  conversation, typically publishing big reports on Monday or Tuesday.
*  Contract fraud, rives in police shakedowns, and spending the rest of the week posting supporting
*  documents on Twitter and Facebook.
*  On Fridays, he would retreat to a little studio at the back of the newsroom to talk live
*  with his sources for his weekly webcast.
*  The big story in 2021 was Juan Antonio Xtlaua Corriuela, Cetacuo's boyish and popular
*  mayor, who 12 years earlier was arrested by federal agents after his name appeared on
*  the payroll of a local drug cartel.
*  The case against the mayor fell apart, and he stayed in politics, heading off to various
*  federal jobs.
*  He had recently made a successful bid to take back the mayor's office, this time with
*  men totalling high-power rifles that face his covered in ski masks, standing watch
*  at campaign events.
*  Linadez's sources said the men were from the Highly School New Generation cartel.
*  And now, a commander of that cartel was on the other end of his cell phone, wanting to
*  speak.
*  Linadez put two fingers over the receiver and gestured to another reporter in the newsroom
*  to come over quickly.
*  He needed him to tape the call.
*  Linadez grabbed a notebook and pen, putting the phone on speaker.
*  Who's this?
*  He said.
*  The caller got straight to his point.
*  Monitor Michoacán needed to stop taking shots at the local government and the prosecutor's
*  office.
*  Linadez interrupted.
*  He said the outlet didn't take sides.
*  His job was to document events, nothing more.
*  But the caller did not want to debate the role of journalism in a democracy.
*  He said Linadez would hear from him again and then hung up.
*  Two weeks later, Linadez was at home when his phone bust, this time with a much more direct
*  message on WhatsApp.
*  You were told to stop trashing the government.
*  The text said, I'm trying to be your friend.
*  But if I can't, you're going to have problems with us.
*  Stop trashing the prosecutor.
*  Linadez stared at the message on his phone, unsure of what to do next.
*  The Monitor was investigating claims that the city government was overpaying crony contractors
*  from municipal lighting projects and it also done reporting that showed ties between the
*  Haleesco cartel and the prosecutor's office.
*  He knew that the threat was serious and that the promised problems almost certainly meant
*  death as another local reporter told me.
*  Killing a journalist is very easy and very cheap.
*  Linadez also knew the government was likely to do little to protect him and his colleagues.
*  Attacks on reporters in Mexico were almost never solved by investigators who were often
*  themselves either terrified of or in league with the killers.
*  The journalists were on their own.
*  There was a phrase the editor had long repeated in the newsroom.
*  We have only our pens to defend ourselves.
*  He said his phone was tied.
*  The Monitor would keep publishing just as it always had.
*  Who's who enlives?
*  The world has become an increasingly dangerous place for reporters.
*  But outside the war in Ukraine, no place is more deadly for them than Mexico.
*  Since the central government began its brutal and chaotic war on drugs in 2006, at least
*  128 reporters have been killed there, according to the committee to protect journalists,
*  13 of them last year alone, a chilling record.
*  Mexican journalists have faced phone hacks, death threats, beatings, torture and in one
*  case, grenade attacks on their newsroom.
*  They face these perils in part because the authorities whose job it is to protect them
*  have in many instances long been infiltrated by the cartels.
*  Hernado García Luna, Mexico's former secretary of public security, for example, was convicted
*  in the United States this year for taking millions of dollars in bribes from Masinaloa cartel
*  in the early 2000s when he was head of the Mexican equivalent of the FBI.
*  And in 2014, police officers in the rural city Iguala kidnapped 43 students on buses
*  headed for a march in Mexico City and handed them over to a drug cartel that mistakenly
*  assumed they were part of an attack from arrival.
*  This year, a trove of text messages showed that nearly every branch of government in
*  the region, including soldiers, the police and a local mayor, were communicating with the
*  cartel, which killed the students and incinerated some of them in a crematory.
*  Unable to protect journalists where they work, Mexico resorted to hiding them in safe
*  houses across the country.
*  After years of increasing entanglement with criminal groups, the Mexican government is in
*  some sense in a battle with itself, with case after case in which the government is,
*  where it least appears to be, has involved in the crime as an impunishment.
*  Sometimes the connection is clear.
*  In 2017, Miroslav Abredch-Veldusea, a journalist in Mexico's northern state Iguala, was shot
*  dead by a drug gang after years of reporting on corruption and criminal groups.
*  A former mayor, Bredch, had reported on, Ugua, Medjulz, Algaraz, later admitted to passing
*  along recordings of the journalists and members of the gang that killed her and was sentenced
*  to eight years in prison for his role in her death.
*  The concerns about government complicity often fall on death fears.
*  In 2014, Provene Espinoza, a 31-year-old photographer, began receiving threats after the news magazine,
*  Proceso, published a picture he took of Javier Duarte de Ojoa, then governor of the state
*  of Veda Cruz, in an article declaring it, a lawless state.
*  In 2015, after fleeing Veda Cruz, Espinoza was shot to death with four others in an apartment
*  in Mexico City.
*  At least 17 reporters from Veda Cruz were killed while Duarte held office, a gruesome record.
*  The former governor is now in prison on organized crime charges, but he has never been indicted
*  in connection with any of the killings.
*  Of 105 investigations of killings of journalists in Mexico since 2010, only six resulted in homicide
*  sentences according to human rights watch.
*  Apart from defending journalists, some of the country's most prominent officials have turned
*  on them.
*  In 2021, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador added a new weekly segment to his morning press
*  briefing called, Who's Who, In Lies?
*  In December, he took aim at three reporters, including Ciro Gomez Leiva, a prominent television
*  anchor saying that, if you listen to them too much, you could even get a brain tumor.
*  The next day, Gomez Leiva was driving home from his broadcast when two men on a motorcycle
*  opened fire on his car.
*  The anchor survived only because the car was equipped with bullet-resistant glass windows.
*  Armando Linares knew that investigating the local government could be risky on many
*  levels.
*  At his last news outfit, a daily broadsheet called El Dispertar.
*  He had spent months looking into connections between the State Prosecutor's Office and
*  the drug gangs it was supposedly pursuing.
*  His colleagues had warned him that the newspaper was dependent on ads from the local government.
*  Soon enough, the state attorney general called a meeting with the newspaper's owner seeking
*  to shut down the reports.
*  When he not has heard about the meeting, he confronted the owner and soon left the paper.
*  Several of his colleagues told me, though it was unclear if he had been fired or resigned
*  out of protest.
*  One former colleague described Linares to me as the kind of street reporter who was so plugged
*  in that he sometimes showed up at crime scenes before the police.
*  But he also had had drinking problems and years before went to rehab for drug addiction.
*  He was married but hadn't lived in the same house as his wife and three children, years.
*  Joel Vera Terrasas, his colleague at Monitor Mijuakan, told me that reporting is what saved
*  Armando from Armando, from his demons.
*  When Vera, a prominent attorney in Cita Cuarro spotted Linares in a traditional Mexican
*  sweat lodge on the outskirts of town after he parted ways with El Dispertar.
*  He said he could see the toll the last months had taken on his friend.
*  And so Vera made Linares a proposal.
*  He would bankroll a new outlet in town with Linares at the helm.
*  On a Monday morning in 2019, the staff of Monitor Mijuakan gathered in its newsroom, a small
*  office downstairs from Vera's law firm.
*  Among those there was Roberto Toleda Barrella, a former bus driver who signed up to work
*  as the outlet's cameraman and photographer.
*  Wilberto Sebastián Hulling, a lawyer in Vera's office, was hired as a part-time researcher.
*  Vera would take care of the business ends and write his own weekly column.
*  And Linares, as Vera had promised, was now the outlet's editor and lead writer.
*  Vera eventually bought a suit and matching shoes for Linares and insisted that he wear
*  them to interviews.
*  But other than that, Vera Toledares, he wouldn't interfere with his work.
*  Linares now had a type of freedom he hadn't felt before.
*  Something few journalists in Mexico have ever enjoyed.
*  He was in charge of his own outlet and was editorially independent.
*  No vendas tu pluma, he told the newsroom, don't sell your pen.
*  I fear for my life.
*  In the two years that monitor Mijuakan had been publishing over the course of dozens of
*  investigations, Linares had never received such a direct threat as the ones leveled by
*  the mysterious call and WhatsApp message.
*  Vera decided to seek help from the authorities, but no one in the newsroom trusted officials
*  in Citacuoro.
*  Instead, Vera traveled with Linares to Mexico City, where they met officials from the Federal
*  Prosecutor's Office devoted to crimes against free speech.
*  The unit sits under Mexico's Attorney General's Office, which has broad powers to help protect
*  journalists, including offering referrals for extraction into the government's safe houses.
*  For an hour, Vera explained to an official the work the money Dord had been doing and
*  the threats they had received.
*  He provided a list of nine politicians among MCC Tacuoro's mayor and local prosecutor,
*  who the newsroom believed could have been behind the threat.
*  The official Vera told me seemed unmoved by the story, saying such threats happened often,
*  and the matter would probably blow over.
*  Vera and Linares left the office empty handed, no referral for extraction or any other protective
*  measure.
*  Linares told no one else in Citacuoro about the threats, not even his wife.
*  He continued his investigations, publishing stories about the inflated municipal lighting
*  contracts and the detective who Linares' sources claimed was charging crime victims up
*  to 10,000 vessels, roughly $480 at the time to investigate.
*  If there's no money, there are no investigations.
*  He wrote,
*  Soon the situation with the eagle escalated, the cartel boss called again to demand a little
*  support payment to the group, and then again, and again.
*  The requested amount varied with each call, but the eagle eventually settled on the sum
*  of 500,000 vessels, roughly $24,000.
*  Linares and Vera realized that they were now trapped in the same kind of extortion scheme
*  that they had spent the years reporting on.
*  They stalled for time, and Vera called in acquaintance who was a martial arts instructor
*  for some security advice.
*  The instructor suggested installing video cameras, as well as a second door at the entrance
*  of the newsroom, which could be opened by a buzzer only after arrivals passed through
*  the first.
*  The doors would be made of steel, reinforced to withstand bullets.
*  Even if intruders made it past the first door, they would find a locked door between themselves
*  and the newsroom.
*  Vera knew the payment couldn't be avoided if he wanted the newsroom to remain safe.
*  He and his wife withdrew money from their savings, and some of the staff set up a collection
*  from friends.
*  In mid-December, Linares settled on a date to make the handoff, but the location of the
*  rendezvous was unusual.
*  The eagle wanted to meet at the blasso in front of the mayor's office.
*  The wads of money didn't fit into an envelope, and so Linares found a paper bag to stuff 500,000
*  vessels into.
*  At 10am, Toledo arrived with the bag of cash as Linares watched from a corner and saw
*  Asteon from a parked car.
*  Two men from the cartel arrived, parking and slots reserved for government employees.
*  Their faces recovered, and it was impossible to tell whether the eagle had come or sent
*  two of his lieutenants.
*  Whatever the payment achieved, it did not prevent the arrival of another far more menacing,
*  and it was a fake Facebook account posted Linares's WhatsApp profile picture which showed
*  him standing with a woman.
*  That was somewhat worrying.
*  Even more worrying was that the post claimed that the woman in the photo was related to
*  a leader of Gardelez Unidos, a rival of the eagle's cartel, and that Linares was in
*  league with them.
*  The danger was immediately clear to everyone in the newsroom.
*  In the past, before deadly hits against journalists, mysterious messages often surfaced linking reporters
*  to cartel groups.
*  Sometimes Mexican officials even played up the supposed connections with little evidence.
*  This allowed the killing to look like another hit among cartel members and offered an easy
*  excuse to avoid an investigation.
*  Let us sat with the other members of the newsroom for a moment, deliberating about what to do.
*  Linares headed to the transmission room.
*  Toledo followed him in, flipping on the switches of the camera as the two prepared a Facebook
*  live broadcast.
*  Linares was wearing a yellow puffer jacket in a face mask, which he pulled off before
*  he began to speak.
*  Good evening friends of monitor Michoacán.
*  He began.
*  He explained the mysterious Facebook post and said the woman had nothing to do with
*  any criminal group.
*  The fake online profiles were meant to spread disinformation and distract from the actual
*  news that they were publishing.
*  Using the usual logic, we know these attacks come directly from our public officials.
*  Linares continued.
*  In the last days and weeks, there have been killings of journalists who have exposed corrupt
*  governments.
*  He said, the same thing could happen here in Citacoaro.
*  He added, today I can tell you this.
*  I fear for my life and I will be seeking federal protection.
*  Mexico has very strict gun laws, but many people do carry them illegally.
*  That fall, where the had gone epistol from a friend.
*  He tried to give the gun to Linares who turned him down.
*  He approached Toledo next.
*  Take it Roberto, Vera said, you carry it, you're the one on the street.
*  But Toledo declined too.
*  He shot photos, he reasoned, not bullets.
*  No boss, you keep it.
*  He said, handing the gun back to Vera.
*  If they come, then I will take the bullet for you.
*  We're here from City Hall.
*  Toledo started the morning of January 31, 2022 with a stop at the prosecutor's office.
*  The monitor had a running tally of surprise visits it made to various municipal buildings
*  to see if workers were present during their posted office hours.
*  As usual, there wasn't much to see, so Toledo took a photo of the empty desks.
*  His cell phone rang and it was Vera on the line with a request.
*  Could Toledo bring a couple of bottles of coke back to the office?
*  The photographer stopped at a corner store, then headed back in the direction of the newsroom.
*  At the same time, several men on motorcycles approached monitor Michoacán and parked on
*  a side street with a view of the entrance.
*  Two of the men walked up to the building as Toledo, coax in hand, rang the buzzer.
*  Speaking through the inner calm, Vera asked the strangers why they were there.
*  We're here from City Hall, one of the men said, but this looked nothing like an official
*  visit.
*  One of the men wore a grey hoodie with the hood pulled down low and the other was in a
*  baseball cap.
*  Only their eyes could be seen above their face masks.
*  Vera buzzed Toledo through the first door and the two men came in behind him.
*  Sebastian cracked open the second door, then shed it immediately when he saw guns.
*  Agali, Agali!
*  Called the man in the hoodie.
*  Do it.
*  Gunfire rang out.
*  Paolo raised his arms at a instinct as though he could block the bullets.
*  They tore through his forearms and pierced his torso.
*  Vera watched all this, petrified through the closed circuit video cameras.
*  Then he shook himself and grabbed his gun from his desk, heading to the front of the newsroom.
*  He crouched down, taking a firing position with his finger on the trigger.
*  Another volley of bullets rang out, hitting the door several times.
*  The door helped.
*  There were more words outside than the sound of a motorcycle speeding away.
*  Finally, Vera put down his gun.
*  Someone called an ambulance, so Asdian rushed outside.
*  For a second Toledo still seems very much himself.
*  His black running shoe still on his feet, his cigarettes and big pen still in his bucket.
*  Yet he was in a pool of blood.
*  There were three bullet holes in his stomach and others in his arms, his sternum and his
*  shoulder.
*  Bullet fragments were lodged in his heart, liver and intestines.
*  He was saying something, but no one could hear him.
*  Veda drew closer.
*  They got me.
*  Was all the hurt.
*  They got me.
*  Veda's rushed to Lethal to the hospital.
*  For a moment there was only silence in the newsroom.
*  Leighnatt has walked in the door, having rushed back from an interview in another part
*  of town.
*  Except for him in Toledo, everyone was at their desks when the gunmen arrived.
*  Veda's pistol would have been no match for them, but I thought that they had broken
*  through the entire newsroom would have been dead.
*  It was the only hopeful thought that Veda could muster at that moment.
*  And even that bit of solace was shattered when the phone rang.
*  Toledo had died on his way to the hospital.
*  Then came another blow.
*  Detectives from the prosecutor's office, the very people Linares had made his career
*  denouncing as corrupt, were now setting up crime scene tape and collecting shells.
*  The officials asked for a statement and Linares refused, saying he didn't trust them.
*  Then he went into his office, cried, collected himself and finally approached Veda.
*  We can do a broadcast, he said in a low voice.
*  Veda looked at Linares announcing the shooting online felt like a terrible idea.
*  No, leave it be, he said, they finished us.
*  They finished us, oh man, no broadcast.
*  This will only bring us problems.
*  But Linares didn't care.
*  He went into the transmission room and started flipping on the switches to the computers
*  and microphones.
*  They came so naturally to him.
*  A process so wrought the firm moment he forgot that his camera operator was dead, the light
*  of Roberto.
*  He called down before he realized his mistake.
*  My friends were going to broadcast now and it will be brief.
*  He said into the camera.
*  Today a member of our team has been assassinated.
*  His website had investigated the city's political elite and had received death threats in return.
*  He said, now the newsroom had paid the price, but they would not stop work, he said.
*  They had a list of names of those behind the attack and soon he warned, information
*  will be flowing.
*  We're not armed, we don't carry weapons.
*  Our only defense is a pen, a pencil, and a notebook.
*  He said, raising the spiral pad that sat next to him.
*  I regret this is how things are.
*  That there are attempts to destroy freedom of expression and the right to true and timely
*  information.
*  I have pointed the finger at some people and some politicians and today I will say it
*  again.
*  I will keep reporting.
*  I will keep after these people and he added, we will take this to the bitter end.
*  The people will protect me.
*  The United's broadcast had barely begun to circulate on social media when another report
*  emerged.
*  Investigators on the scene had found two notes written on colorful poster board left beside
*  Toledo's body.
*  One of them signed by the Halleís School New Generation cartel said, this is what happens
*  to lawyers who take on the cases of La Familia Mijrocana, a rival cartel.
*  Veda found himself suddenly on the defensive.
*  Many lawyers throughout Mexico had worked with drug traffickers at times legally by defending
*  members in court against charges, but sometimes illegally by setting up shell companies to
*  launder drug proceeds, for example.
*  Veda had represented a number of business interests in Cidadquo over the years, including
*  one of its bus companies, but never he said anything affiliated with organized crime.
*  If there had been any links, he told me, it would have been apparent to the journalists
*  at the monitor, their newsroom shared an office with his firm.
*  It became clear to Veda that the notes were part of a broader campaign that evening, when
*  Xlavaque himself gave an interview to reporters on Milenio Televichyong, a national cable news
*  network.
*  Iíd like to first make some clarifications, the mere set of the killing.
*  The preliminary information that we have is that this wasnít a journalist.
*  As the mayor spoke, he repeated several times that the attack had occurred at a legal office,
*  and he never mentioned the monitor by name.
*  Ector Samarro, one of the reporters, looked skeptical, saying that Toledo had worked
*  at the monitor.
*  The mayor replied that he hadnít found Toledoís name registered with the journalist guilt.
*  The other reporter, Paola Parquette, pointed out that Toledo had received death threats
*  from the work he had done.
*  I donít know if he got threats or not.
*  The mayor replied.
*  Reporters from Mexico City began to call Veda for comment.
*  Had Toledo not been a journalist after all, what did Veda make of the messages that seemed
*  to have been left for him by the cartel?
*  The questions angered him.
*  If these journalists in the cap had covered Cidacguaro before this, they would have seen
*  Toledo at work when he was alive.
*  But the monitor had been one of the few outlets on the ground, and the only one investigating
*  the mayorís office.
*  If Xtlawak and his city officials had in fact ordered the attack to stop the negative coverage,
*  then claiming Toledo wasnít a journalist was simply a means to obscure the motive.
*  Veda thought about the messages left by the attackers.
*  Crime scene evidence in Mexico was typically confidential before a trial.
*  Yet many reporters now seem to know about the notes claiming that Veda was working with
*  a drug cartel.
*  Veda suspected it was the prosecutorís office that was leaking the information to discredit
*  them.
*  The monitor, rudderless in the hours since the attack on its newsroom, was no longer in
*  control of the news cycle in Cidacguaro.
*  The government was.
*  And the narrative was this.
*  The attack on the newsroom had nothing to do with its journalism.
*  The story seemed to be solidifying at the highest level.
*  That afternoon, Jesús Ramirez Guévas, the spokesman for Lopez Obrador, had condemned
*  the assassination of the journalist Roberto Toledo in a statement from the presidentís
*  office.
*  But that evening, he issued a new statement.
*  According to judicial investigations, the citizen Roberto Toledo, who was assassinated
*  today, worked as an assistant in a lawyerís office, not as a journalist.
*  Veda decided that he would have to leave the task of correcting the record for another
*  day.
*  So long as he and his team were in Cidacguaro, their lives remained in danger.
*  He called the Inaris and said they needed to leave town immediately.
*  We would be letting them win.
*  Linares sent.
*  By then, the federal government had offered Linares the possibility of extraction into his
*  safe house, but putting himself in the hands of one branch of government to protect
*  himself from another seemed not just absurd, but like a potentially deadly gamble.
*  Veda was insistent.
*  Whoever attacked the newsroom had already won.
*  When he told me Joachán could no longer safely publish, he said, no story was worth their
*  lives.
*  But Linares argued that his life wasnít in danger.
*  Donít be a fool.
*  Veda replied.
*  He was yelling now.
*  What would I do, Linares asked?
*  How would I make my living?
*  Veda, realizing that his friends would be crushed if he lost his work, back down.
*  Linares lived alone with two dogs.
*  On some days his sources were his only human contact.
*  Veda and Sahuasdhyán left Cidacguaro, deciding they would try to persuade Linares to join
*  them later.
*  Linares, acting on his vow to take this to the bitter end, had spent the afternoon lining
*  up a long series of television and radio interviews in which he linked the local government to
*  the killing.
*  In one, Linares repeated his claim that the mayorís office had been behind the threats, adding
*  that just a half hour before his phone rang with another one.
*  He did not hide the fact that he had decided to remain in Cidacguaro.
*  Some people of our team decided to leave today, but some of us have to stay to continue
*  this battle.
*  He said.
*  As the days passed, Veda persuaded Linares to make a statement to the federal authorities
*  in Mexico City.
*  It would be to the same federal officials who sent them back empty handed after the previous
*  threats, but Linares realized there were few other options.
*  For about an hour, he gave his statement to investigators at the Free Speech Crimes Unit,
*  offering a list of officials in Cidacguaro, who he said were behind the threatening messages.
*  He noted that the cartel had been clear in every call that the threat had come because
*  the monitor was screwing the government, and to level he said again was a journalist.
*  I want to state that I am scared, that I fear that they will come and attack me.
*  He concluded.
*  Thatís all I wish to have.
*  The authorities again seemed unmoved.
*  Linares was offered a referral to leave Cidacguaro, but when he turned it down, he was not given
*  other measures, like a government bodyguard or a panic button, typically provided to journalists
*  who choose to stay in their home town.
*  The officials thanked him for his testimony and said they would be in touch if they had
*  more questions.
*  After the interview, Linares and Veda, who had come along to support him, went to a coffee
*  shop near the prosecutorís office, but had tried one more time to persuade him to leave
*  Cidacguaro.
*  Linares said he would make it where he was.
*  He had a following there, especially in the indigenous community.
*  The people will protect me, he said.
*  Later that month, investigators released Tolesoís remains from custody, and Veda paid the expenses
*  for them to be returned to his home state, Morelos, about a four-hour drive from Cidacguaro.
*  Veda, in hiding, watched over his zoom call as a mariachi band played.
*  Tolesoís son lifted his phone so Veda could see the coffin of his friend, lowered into
*  the ground.
*  Alone in the newsroom, Linares tried to create assemblances of normalcy.
*  He did a broadcast from the central plaza in the nearby town of Campo, to interview the
*  mayor about remodeling the roof of the town hall.
*  He drove to the north of Cidacguaro to report from the crime scene of a night time shooting,
*  but he remained scared, and Veda remained frightened for him.
*  Finally, in March, a friend managed to change Linaresís mind.
*  It would take just a few days to put together the money, and then he would flee.
*  No one will thank you.
*  On March 15, two men on the motorcycle began to prowl the area around Linaresís home.
*  He was just before lunchtime, and a nearby food vendor was hawking tacos and corn.
*  The motorcycle headed one direction, slowly, along north doctor Emilio got a sea of street,
*  and then a minute later doubled back.
*  The man riding on the back stepped off.
*  He was looking for Linares, he said to one of the neighbors.
*  He was a soccer fan and wanted to publish something in monitor Michoacán.
*  Someone must have pointed to Linaresís door.
*  At around 6 pm, Linares posted an article about a motorcycle accident, then headed home.
*  As he approached his door, a man walked toward him wearing a black suit, and a red dye.
*  The man greeted Linares, who looked up and greeted him back.
*  They shook hands, and spoke for a moment before heading inside Linaresís apartment.
*  About 5 minutes later, the man in the suit was seen running from the building.
*  Weíll never know what the two men discussed.
*  Weíll never know exactly when the man in the red tie drew the gun he was hiding, and fired
*  at Linares.
*  The police found his body riddled with eight rounds.
*  It was 43 days after Dolevoís murder.
*  Now in hiding, Veda felt helpless.
*  He had been told by the police not to speak out about the monitor to avoid attracting
*  attention from criminal groups.
*  Yet he needed somewhere to put his anger.
*  So many times he and Linares had discussed the importance of reporting done in the public
*  interest.
*  They once called themselves soldiers of journalism and civil rights.
*  They felt there had been an understanding that should the monitor come and to threat
*  those whom they had stood up for would come to their defense.
*  There would be marches, signs hung at the mayorís office.
*  There would be something they thought.
*  And yet, at his moment of need, Linares died alone and scared, himself accused of ties
*  to drug traffickers.
*  You can write an article, and give your life, and no one will thank you.
*  Veda told me, ìIs it worth publishing if it puts your life at risk?î
*  I am still thinking about that question.
*  We said letís do it.
*  Letís go.
*  But now I wonder.
*  Was this worth two dead colleagues?
*  The day after Linaresís death, Veda decided to close Money Doored Me, Dr. Ghan.
*  There would be no more visits to Town Hall and no more broadcasts from the transmission
*  room.
*  There would be no website beyond the Facebook page.
*  The years of investigations in Cita Cuadro would disappear from the internet.
*  Those who had attacked them.
*  And one, news was spreading about the murder of Linares.
*  Another local journalist began to hear rumors that more reporters would be killed.
*  Just seeing motorcycles circling the neighborhood, the journalist fled.
*  Soon afterward another local journalist did the same.
*  The press corps in Cita Cuadro was doing the doing.
*  Linaresís funeral was held the day after his killing, at a funeral home a few blocks
*  from the municipal cemetery.
*  It was a hot day for March, and the scent of roses and lilies hung in the air.
*  Most of the seats in the chapel were empty.
*  Veda sent a wreath.
*  He and Sebastian once again watched a livestream from their government safe houses.
*  Linares's wife, Rosalina Pedrasa, attended along with her children.
*  When a cameraman from a national news station approached her for an interview, she said
*  she would talk, just not on camera.
*  He knew that his life was in danger, but his passion for speaking the truth pushed
*  him never to shut up.
*  She sent.
*  The few people who had arrived didnít remain long, filing out to allow Linares's family
*  one last moment with his coffin.
*  They too left, leaving a handful of reporters who had come to cover the funeral.
*  Minus later, four unknown men arrived at the funeral, one wore leather jacket and a
*  ski mask to cover his face.
*  During a gun, he approached the reporters and said, ìIf you donít get out of here in
*  two minutes, youíre going to be sorry.î He didnít fire.
*  The journalist left the funeral.
*  I was not the mastermind.
*  In February, just after the anniversary of Dolellís death, I met Veda in Mexico City.
*  I had been talking to him for several months.
*  We would meet over Zoom after he had breakfast and talked for an hour or two before making
*  plans to speak again.
*  We sent each other Christmas greetings, asked after each otherís families.
*  But when I asked him if we could meet at his safe house, he said he preferred to travel
*  to the capital.
*  Veda wanted his location to remain unknown, even to me.
*  The buzzer rang at the office where we had agreed to meet and Veda walked in, holding
*  a large stack of legal documents.
*  In the years since he fled Sitacuerl, he had become a kind of private investigator, trying
*  to gather what information he could about the deaths of Linares de Centolegl.
*  He was forced to live in the shadow of incredible uncertainty.
*  On one hand, he said, he believed it was Sitacuerlís local government officials who orchestrated
*  the killings of his colleagues.
*  On the other hand, the federal government was running the safe house that he was living
*  in now.
*  Veda insisted that neither could be trusted to solve the murder cases.
*  There had been no arrests and little sign of investigation.
*  I want to show you who signed the government is on.
*  Veda said.
*  He pulled out a document, sliding it across the table, a judicial decision about a wire
*  tap that federal investigators asked for before Linaresís death.
*  But the authorities hadnít only asked to listen to the phones of the cartelman who had threatened
*  them.
*  He wanted to tap the phones of Veda and Linares.
*  A judge rejected the request, saying the victims of a crime shouldnít be surveilled this way.
*  Veda was convinced the investigators were trying to gather dirt on him and Linares that would
*  undermine them somehow.
*  Weíve been victimized twice now.
*  First directly by the attack, the deaths everything.
*  And then the state is trying to cast doubt on us.
*  He said, they should be investigating these politicians, not Armando and me.
*  The next morning, I took a bus to the Special Prosecutorís Unit in charge of crimes against
*  free speech.
*  The same office where Veda and Linares filed their original complaints.
*  Much had changed since their initial visit when they returned to Citacuaro, I am t-handed.
*  With two journalists killed at the same outlet, the monitorís case had become one of the
*  most notorious to reach the office in years.
*  Ricardo Sanchez Perez del Poso, the young prosecutor who has the office, greeted me formally
*  and offered a description of the inner workings of his unit.
*  The department had been charged with, among other tasks, taking over investigations of attacks
*  on journalists when local investigators or elected officials might themselves be complicit.
*  He said that in this particular case, a group of experts had reviewed the work of monitor
*  Michoacán, the threats and the evidence from the crime scene.
*  What came next took me by surprise.
*  We determined that we are not taking on the case.
*  He said of Dolayl's death.
*  Our analysis determined that nothing he published, wrote or gave an opinion on as a journalist
*  was linked to the circumstances of his homicide.
*  It was the same for Linares.
*  I stopped the prosecutor for a moment.
*  I told him I had a copy of the state prosecutorís case file and it contained a page upon page
*  of threats from an alleged cartel commander saying the monitor needed to stop criticizing
*  the government, or there would be consequences.
*  There were screenshots of Linaresís phone with the WhatsApp messages.
*  Sanchez seemed surprised that I had the documents and warned that they were confidential.
*  He said again that there was little evidence the crime had to do with journalism and no
*  need for him to take over the case.
*  Michoacán's state prosecutor was handling the case instead.
*  That appeared to conclude the conversation.
*  But as he packed up to head to a hearing, I reminded Sanchez that the threats against
*  the monitor were sent to stop the corruption investigations of the same prosecutorís office
*  that was now assigned to solve their killings.
*  The office investigating the case had repeatedly been named as one of the suspects in the
*  attack by Linares.
*  Could they really be trusted to solve a crime that the newspaper had accused them of being
*  behind?
*  Sanchez said he was only following the law.
*  I canít change whatís in the Constitution.
*  He told me on his way out.
*  The state prosecutorís office never replied to my requests for an interview.
*  But he still outwacked the mayor, agreed to answer my written questions about Linaresís
*  accusations that he had ordered the attacks.
*  I was not the mastermind or the man behind the threats against monitor Michoacán or any
*  other media outlet.
*  And for that matter, I have no relationship with any person who calls himself the eagle.
*  Islaoac wrote.
*  In fact, he wrote no investigator had ever questioned him in the case.
*  Islaoac offered his condolences to the victims and said monitor Michoacánís criticism of
*  the local government had on occasion pointed to legitimate problems he tried to fix as
*  mayor.
*  His office later sent a statement calling most of the claims made by the outlet, a lie.
*  As for the armed cartel gunman who were seen at events during his campaign, Islaoac
*  wrote, ìThe election had been a fair one.
*  And if such an assertion about links to armed groups carried any weight, the election
*  would have gone, the other way.î
*  He had long been a target of dirty politics by his opponents, he wrote, including during
*  his initial arrest for supposedly working with a cartel in 2009.
*  The former secretary of public security who spearheaded his arrest was now being detained
*  in the United States for his collaboration with cartel groups, the mayor wrote, referring
*  to the case of Hernado García Luna while he himself remained a free man.
*  I knew the mayor's statement was true in at least one regard.
*  Mexicoís government had been corrupted at almost nearly every level.
*  Mexico is a hall of mayors to any journalist.
*  It is so hard to tell who is telling the truth because the line between crime fighter and
*  criminal has become so blurred it often ceases to exist.
*  The people who were supposed to clarify that line with the local reporters at monitor Michoacán.
*  But of course, they too were gone.
*  Ciedacguaro is a zone of silence.
*  The recent months have only left more cases piling up.
*  Angelí aeth the body of Luis Martín Sanchez in years.
*  A correspondence for the newspaper La Horna was found dead with signs of violence according
*  to authorities in the state of Náñarí.
*  A week later, Nelson Matos Benia, a photographer and editor in Acabulco, was shot dead in his
*  car.
*  I knew Matos from when he shot photos for an article I wrote about drug gang hits in
*  2011.
*  One afternoon in August, I was scanning the local papers in Mexico when it came across
*  the headline.
*  The police had captured a suspect in the notices killing.
*  It appeared to have happened somewhat by accident.
*  He was caught with two other gang members when their truck was seen speeding in front of
*  a police station.
*  When the police ran his name, Carlos Herardo Sanchez-Mendosa, to the system, they found an arrest
*  warrant from the Michoacán prosecutor's office seeking him in connection with the murder.
*  The authorities said he had gone by the alias O2 as a member of the Halleís Goenú Generation
*  cartel.
*  Not long afterward, I received a message from Celastiane, the researcher at Monitor Michoacán,
*  who was on the other side of the door when Roberto Toledo was shot.
*  We had been in communication several times during my reporting and I wanted to know if the
*  news had given him any sense of calm.
*  It hadnít.
*  Maybe Sanchez had pulled the trigger, he said, but if he was the hitman, then who ordered
*  the attack?
*  The arrest wasnít the only reason Celastiane had asked to speak that evening.
*  He wanted to tell me that the government agency in charge of the safe house that he was
*  staying in had notified him that he would no longer need the protection.
*  The decision had happened before Sanchez's arrest, so it was far from clear how the government
*  concluded that the threat was gone.
*  Celastiane paused on the other end of the line as though the news needed to sink in
*  for him as well.
*  He had been in hiding for the better part of two years and his wife and three-year-old
*  son were leading the same precarious life with him.
*  He had felt a higher calling to be a journalist, but that vanished long ago, replaced now by
*  a simple desire for survival.
*  In many ways it was the same in Cedacuoar itself now.
*  A few reporters had stepped in to fill the vacuum left by those who fled and someone had
*  even started posting regularly again on Morning Doored Mijwakanís Facebook page.
*  But the tone was different.
*  The pigeons of Cedacuoar also formed part of the image of our city, was what ran over
*  a series of photos of birds in the city's main square.
*  There were no signs of the muck-raking the outlet was known for.
*  Cedacuoar is his own of silence now.
*  Sebastiane said.
*  So Sebastiane was no longer a reporter, but he retained the gallows humour that has become
*  so common among journalists in Mexico.
*  He would challenge the decision to end most of his protection, he said.
*  But even if he lost his safehouse, he would still have his government issued panic button.
*  When the hitman comes and wants to kill me again, Iíll tell him.
*  Just give me a minute please, hitman.
*  Let me press my panic button.
