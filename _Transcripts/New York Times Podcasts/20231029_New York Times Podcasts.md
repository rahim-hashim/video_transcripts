# The Sunday Read: ‘Who Hired the Hitmen to Silence Zitácuaro?’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ2drLynwpU)
*  My name is Nick Casey. I'm a writer for the New York Times magazine. Mexico is in the
*  middle of a war against drug traffickers. But there's a second conflict there that
*  you might not know about. It's a war to silence Mexico's free press.
*  Last year, Mexico was one of the deadliest places in the world for journalists to work,
*  and not only to Ukraine. Mexican journalists have faced phone hacks, death threats,
*  beatings, torture, and in one case a pair of grenades launched at their newsroom.
*  Because no one has figured out how to protect journalists where they work,
*  Mexico has resorted to the extreme step of hiding reporters in safe houses across the country.
*  What's behind these threats is pretty simple. Many of the reporters under threat were investigating
*  the government that was supposed to protect them. And many in the government for years have been
*  on the payroll of Mexico's drug cartels. Now, imagine you're a reporter in Mexico. How do you
*  do your job when you can't distinguish between the crime fighters and the criminals? Is this
*  prosecutor I'm speaking to involved with a crime that I'm reporting? And what will he do to me for
*  writing about it? It's a hall of mirrors. In Mexico, you're on your own.
*  This week's Sunday read is my story about a local newsroom in Mexico called the Michoacan Monitor.
*  The Monitor was a small news outlet, just one editor and a few of his friends, and they decided
*  to investigate corruption in their city government. Soon they started getting threats. And as you'll
*  hear in the story, some of these threats became real. But these did not deter Armando Linares,
*  the editor-in-chief of the Monitor. And so even after the photographer of the Monitor was murdered
*  outside the newsroom by two masked assailants, Linares took to Facebook Live to address the killing.
*  In the broadcast, a visibly shaken Linares sits alone in front of a microphone. His phone,
*  a pen, and a reporter's notebook sit on the table. The Michoacan Monitor team has been suffering a
*  series of death threats. Today these threats were carried out and one of our members was murdered
*  today. A few minutes ago, they made an attempt on his life. He lost his life a few minutes ago.
*  That's the way it is at the Michoacan Monitor. I can't talk much.
*  I can't say much. All I can do is tell our colleagues' family that we are not going to
*  lead things like this. We are going to take things to the bitter end. We're not armed.
*  We don't have weapons. Our only defense is a pen, a pencil, and a notebook.
*  The Facebook Live continues. Linares says that he knows who was behind the killing. He goes on
*  to say that he's going to continue to report on corruption despite someone being killed in
*  his newsroom. It's a spectacular decision. This wasn't the first small newsroom to be attacked
*  this way in Mexico. Usually this means the end. Everyone goes into hiding. But with Linares,
*  you have the case of someone who is just so grounded in what he did and what he believed
*  in the power of journalism to change things in a democracy that he decided he wasn't going to
*  leave and he wasn't going to give up. In the end, at the Monitor, you're talking about ordinary
*  reporters with little money or protection, people who thought they could make a contribution by
*  exposing corruption in their town. But what they came up against was something much bigger and much
*  more armed than they were. So here's my article, Who Hired the Hitmen to Silence Sitakwaro? Read
*  by Anthony Rey Perez. On October 19th, 2021, Armando Linares Lopez was writing up notes from
*  an interview when his cell phone buzzed with an unknown number. Linares, 49 and stocky with
*  black hair that was just starting to show gray streaks, ran an online news site in a small Mexican
*  city called Sitakwaro. He knew his beats so intimately that calls from unfamiliar phone
*  numbers were rare. But the man on the other end spoke in a way that was instantly familiar.
*  Linares had come to know that pitched, menacing tone from years of run-ins with every kind of
*  Mexican gangster. Sitakwaro, in the hills of the state of Michoacan, had for years mostly been
*  known for its fertile avocado orchards and the pine oak forest where tourists came to see the
*  annual arrival of the monarch butterflies. But its central location had made it increasingly
*  attractive to the drug trade. Farmers grew marijuana and opium poppy, the source of heroin,
*  in nearby mountains. And in recent years, international drug cartels had been using
*  Michoacan as a way station for methamphetamine and fentanyl shipments.
*  Linares' rise as a journalist coincided with the drug boom, and he watched its devastating
*  effects on Sitakwaro. Severed heads dumped in front of a car dealership, business owners
*  kidnapped for ransom, and a government that seemed unwilling or unable to do anything about it.
*  If Mexico ever hoped to escape the violence that was devouring it,
*  Linares often said the press would need to pursue the politicians who enabled the crime.
*  And so in 2019, he and a few friends founded a new site called Monitor Michoacan,
*  publishing it downstairs from a law office. As the city's main, and perhaps only,
*  muckraker, Linares quickly came to dominate the local conversation,
*  typically publishing big reports on Monday or Tuesday, contract fraud,
*  bribes and police shakedowns, and spending the rest of the week posting supporting documents
*  on Twitter and Facebook. On Fridays, he would retreat to a little studio at the back of the
*  newsroom to talk live with his sources for his weekly webcast.
*  The big story in 2021 was Juan Antonio Ixtlahuac Orihuela, Sitakwaro's boyish and popular mayor,
*  who 12 years earlier was arrested by federal agents after his name appeared on the payroll
*  a local drug cartel. The case against the mayor fell apart, and he stayed in politics,
*  heading off to various federal jobs. He had recently made a successful bid to take back
*  the mayor's office, this time with men toting high-power rifles, their faces covered in ski
*  masks, standing watch at campaign events. Linares' sources said the men were from
*  the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, and now a commander of that cartel was on the other end
*  of his cell phone, wanting to speak. Linares put two fingers over the receiver and gestured
*  to another reporter in the newsroom to come over quickly. He needed him to tape the call.
*  Linares grabbed a notebook and pen, putting the phone on speaker.
*  Who's this? he said.
*  The caller got straight to his point. Monitor Michoacan needed to stop taking shots at the
*  local government and the prosecutor's office. Linares interrupted. He said the outlet didn't
*  take sides. His job was to document events, nothing more. But the caller did not want to
*  debate the role of journalism in a democracy. He said Linares would hear from him again,
*  and then hung up. Two weeks later, Linares was at home when his phone buzzed, this time with a
*  much more direct message on WhatsApp. You were told to stop trashing the government. The text
*  said, I'm trying to be your friend, but if I can't, you're going to have problems with us.
*  Stop trashing the prosecutor. Linares stared at the message on his phone, unsure of what to do
*  next. The monitor was investigating claims that the city government was overpaying crony
*  contractors for municipal lighting projects and had also done reporting that showed ties
*  between the Jalisco Cartel and the prosecutor's office. He knew that the threat was serious and
*  that the promised problems almost certainly meant death, as another local reporter told me. Killing
*  a journalist is very easy and very cheap. Linares also knew the government was likely to do little
*  to protect him and his colleagues. Attacks on reporters in Mexico were almost never solved by
*  investigators, who were often themselves either terrified of or in league with the killers. The
*  journalists were on their own. There was a phrase the editor had long repeated in the newsroom,
*  we have only our pens to defend ourselves. He set his phone aside. The monitor would
*  keep publishing, just as it always had. Who's Who in Lies
*  The world has become an increasingly dangerous place for reporters, but outside the war in Ukraine,
*  no place is more deadly for them than Mexico. Since the central government began its brutal
*  and chaotic war on drugs in 2006, at least 128 reporters have been killed there, according to
*  the Committee to Protect Journalists, 13 of them last year alone. A chilling record.
*  Mexican journalists have faced phone hacks, death threats, beatings, torture, and in one case,
*  grenade attacks on their newsroom. They face these perils in part because the authorities
*  whose job it is to protect them have in many instances long been infiltrated by the cartels.
*  Gennaro Garcia Luna, Mexico's former Secretary of Public Security, for example, was convicted
*  in the United States this year for taking millions of dollars in bribes from the Sinaloa
*  cartel in the early 2000s, when he was head of the Mexican equivalent of the FBI. And in 2014,
*  police officers in the rural city, Iguala, kidnapped 43 students on buses headed for a
*  march in Mexico City and handed them over to a drug cartel that mistakenly assumed they were
*  part of an attack from a rival. This year, a trove of text messages showed that nearly every branch
*  of government in the region, including soldiers, the police, and a local mayor, were communicating
*  with the cartel, which killed the students and incinerated some of them in a crematory.
*  Unable to protect journalists where they work, Mexico resorted to hiding them in safe houses
*  across the country. After years of increasing entanglement with criminal groups, the Mexican
*  government is in some sense in a battle with itself, with case after case in which the
*  government is, or at least appears to be, as involved in the crime as in the punishment.
*  Sometimes the connection is clear. In 2017, Miroslava Brech-Veldusea, a journalist in Mexico's
*  northern state, Chihuahua, was shot dead by a drug gang after years of reporting on corruption
*  and criminal groups. A former mayor Brech had reported on, Hugo Amedxultz Alcaraz, later
*  admitted to passing along recordings of the journalist to members of the gang that killed
*  her and was sentenced to eight years in prison for his role in her death.
*  But concerns about government complicity often fall on deaf ears. In 2014, Rubén Espinosa,
*  a 31-year-old photographer began receiving threats after the news magazine Proceso published a
*  picture he took of Javier Duarte de Ochoa, then governor of the state of Veracruz, in an article
*  declaring it a lawless state. In 2015, after fleeing Veracruz, Espinosa was shot to death
*  with four others in an apartment in Mexico City. At least 17 reporters from Veracruz were killed
*  while Duarte held office. A gruesome record. The former governor is now in prison on organized
*  crime charges, but he has never been indicted in connection with any of the killings. Of 105
*  investigations of killings of journalists in Mexico since 2010, only six resulted in
*  homicide sentences, according to Human Rights Watch. Far from defending journalists, some of
*  the country's most prominent officials have turned on them. In 2021, President Andrés Manuel López
*  Obrador added a new weekly segment to his morning press briefing called, Who's Who in Lies.
*  In December, he took aim at three reporters including Ciro Gómez Leyva, a prominent television
*  anchor saying that, if you listen to them too much, you could even get a brain tumor. The next day,
*  Gómez Leyva was driving home from his broadcast when two men on a motorcycle opened fire on his
*  car. The anchor survived only because the car was equipped with bullet-resistant glass windows.
*  Armando Linares knew that investigating the local government could be risky on many levels.
*  At his last news outfit, a daily broadsheet called El Despertar, he had spent months looking into
*  connections between the state prosecutor's office and the drug gangs it was supposedly pursuing.
*  His colleagues had warned him that the newspaper was dependent on ads from the local government.
*  Soon enough, the state attorney general called a meeting with the newspaper's owner seeking to
*  shut down the reports. When Linares heard about the meeting, he confronted the owner and soon left
*  the paper, several of his colleagues told me, though it was unclear if he had been fired or
*  resigned out of protest. One former colleague described Linares to me as the kind of street
*  reporter who was so plugged in that he sometimes showed up at crime scenes before the police.
*  But he also had had drinking problems and years before went to rehab for drug addiction. He was
*  married but hadn't lived in the same house as his wife and three children in years.
*  Joel Vera-Terrazas, his colleague at Monitor Michoacán, told me that reporting is what
*  saved Armando from Armando, from his demons. When Vera, a prominent attorney in Zitacuaro,
*  spotted Linares at a traditional Mexican sweat lodge on the outskirts of town after he parted
*  ways with El Despertar, he said he could see the toll the last months had taken on his friend.
*  And so Vera made Linares a proposal. He would bankroll a new outlet in town with Linares at the helm.
*  On a Monday morning in 2019, the staff of Monitor Michoacán gathered in its newsroom,
*  a small office downstairs from Vera's law firm. Among those there was Roberto Toleda Barrera,
*  a former bus driver who signed up to work as the outlet's cameraman and photographer.
*  Wilbert Sebastián Holen, a lawyer in Vera's office, was hired as a part-time researcher.
*  Vera would take care of the business end and write his own weekly column, and Linares,
*  as Vera had promised, was now the outlet's editor and lead writer.
*  Vera eventually bought a suit and matching shoes for Linares and insisted that he wear
*  them to interviews. But other than that, Vera told Linares he wouldn't interfere with his work.
*  Linares now had a type of freedom he hadn't felt before, something few journalists in Mexico have
*  ever enjoyed. He was in charge of his own outlet and was editorially independent.
*  No vendas tu pluma, he told the newsroom. Don't sell your pen.
*  I fear for my life.
*  In the two years that Monitor Michoacán had been publishing, over the course of dozens of
*  investigations, Linares had never received such a direct threat as the ones levelled by the
*  mysterious call and WhatsApp message. Vera decided to seek help from the authorities,
*  but no one in the newsroom trusted officials in Sitacuero.
*  Instead, Vera traveled with Linares to Mexico City, where they met officials from the Federal
*  Prosecutor's Office devoted to crimes against free speech. The unit sits under Mexico's Attorney
*  General's Office, which has broad powers to help protect journalists, including offering referrals
*  for extraction into the government safe houses. For an hour, Vera explained to an official the
*  work the Monitor had been doing and the threats they had received. He provided a list of nine
*  politicians, among them Sitacuero's mayor and local prosecutor, who the newsroom believed could
*  have been behind the threat. But the official Vera told me seemed unmoved by the story, saying
*  such threats happened often and the matter would probably blow over. Vera and Linares left the
*  office empty-handed, no referral for extraction or any other protective measure.
*  Linares told no one else in Sitacuero about the threat, not even his wife. He continued his
*  investigations, publishing stories about the inflated municipal lighting contracts and a
*  detective who, Linares' sources claimed, was charging crime victims up to 10,000 pesos,
*  roughly $480 at the time, to investigate. If there's no money, there are no
*  investigations, he wrote. Soon the situation with the eagle escalated. The cartel boss called again
*  to demand a little support payment to the group, and then again and again. The requested amount
*  varied with each call, but the eagle eventually settled on the sum of 500,000 pesos, roughly
*  $24,000. Linares and Vera realized that they were now trapped in the same kind of extortion scheme
*  that they had spent years reporting on. They stalled for time, and Vera called an
*  acquaintance who was a martial arts instructor for some security advice. The instructor suggested
*  installing video cameras, as well as a second door at the entrance of the newsroom, which could be
*  opened by a buzzer only after arrivals passed through the first. The doors would be made of
*  steel, reinforced to withstand bullets. Even if intruders made it past the first door,
*  they would find a locked door between themselves and the newsroom.
*  Vera knew the payment couldn't be avoided if he wanted the newsroom to remain safe.
*  He and his wife withdrew money from their savings, and some of the staff set up a collection from
*  friends. In mid-December, Linares settled on a date to make the handoff,
*  but the location of the rendezvous was unusual.
*  The eagle wanted to meet at the plaza in front of the mayor's office.
*  The wads of money didn't fit into an envelope, and so Linares found a paper bag to stuff 500,000
*  pesos into. At 10 a.m., Toledo arrived with a bag of cash as Linares watched from a corner
*  and saw Astean from a parked car. Two men from the cartel arrived, parking in slots reserved
*  for government employees. Their faces were covered, and it was impossible to tell whether
*  the eagle had come or sent two of his lieutenants. Whatever the payment achieved,
*  it did not prevent the arrival of another, far more menacing, threat.
*  A fake Facebook account posted Linares' WhatsApp profile picture,
*  which showed him standing with a woman. That was somewhat worrying. Even more worrying
*  was that the post claimed that the woman in the photo was related to a leader of Carteles Unidos,
*  a rival of the eagle's cartel, and that Linares was in league with them.
*  The danger was immediately clear to everyone in the newsroom. In the past, before deadly
*  hits against journalists, mysterious messages often surfaced linking reporters to cartel groups.
*  Sometimes Mexican officials even played up the supposed connections with little evidence.
*  This allowed the killing to look like another hit among cartel members and offered an easy
*  excuse to avoid an investigation. Vera sat with the other members of the newsroom for a moment,
*  deliberating about what to do. Linares headed to the transmission room. Toledo followed him in,
*  flipping on the switches of the camera as the two prepared a Facebook live broadcast.
*  Linares was wearing a yellow puffer jacket and a face mask, which he pulled off before he began
*  to speak. Good evening, friends of Monitor Michoacan. He began. He explained the mysterious
*  Facebook post and said the woman had nothing to do with any criminal group. The fake online profiles
*  were meant to spread disinformation and distract from the actual news that they were publishing.
*  Using the usual logic, we know these attacks come directly from our public officials.
*  Linares continued. In the last days and weeks, there have been killings of journalists who have
*  exposed corrupt governments. He said the same thing could happen here in Sitacuaro. He added,
*  today I can tell you this. I fear for my life and I will be seeking federal protection.
*  Mexico has very strict gun laws, but many people do carry them illegally. That fall,
*  Vera had gotten a pistol from a friend. First, he tried to give the gun to Linares,
*  who turned him down. He approached Toledo next.
*  Take it, Roberto. Vera said, you carry it. You're the one on the streets. But Toledo declined, too.
*  He shot photos, he reasoned, not bullets. No, boss, you keep it, he said,
*  handing the gun back to Vera. If they come, then I will take the bullet for you.
*  City Hall
*  We're here from City Hall. Toledo started the morning of January 31,
*  2022 with a stop at the prosecutor's office. The monitor had a running tally of surprise visits
*  it made to various municipal buildings to see if workers were present during their posted office
*  hours. As usual, there wasn't much to see, so Toledo took a photo of the empty desks.
*  His cell phone rang and it was Vera on the line with a request.
*  Could Toledo bring a couple of bottles of Coke back to the office?
*  The photographer stopped at a corner store, then headed back in the direction of the newsroom.
*  At the same time, several men on motorcycles approached Monitor Michoacan and parked on a
*  side street with a view of the entrance. Two of the men walked up to the building as Toledo,
*  Coke's in hand, rang the buzzer. Speaking through the intercom,
*  Vera asked the strangers why they were there.
*  We're here from City Hall, one of the men said, but this looked nothing like an official visit.
*  One of the men wore a gray hoodie with the hood pulled down low, and the other was in a baseball
*  cap. Only their eyes could be seen above their face masks.
*  Vera buzzed Toledo through the first door, and the two men came in behind him.
*  Sebastián cracked open the second door, then shut it immediately when he saw guns.
*  Hágale, hágale! called the man in the hoodie. Do it.
*  Gunfire rang out. Toledo raised his arms out of instinct as though he could block the bullets.
*  They tore through his forearms and pierced his torso.
*  Vera watched all this, petrified, through the closed-circuit video cameras.
*  Then he shook himself and grabbed his gun from his desk, heading to the front of the newsroom.
*  He crouched down, taking a firing position with his finger on the trigger.
*  Another volley of bullets rang out, hitting the door several times.
*  The door held. There were more words outside, and the sound of a motorcycle speeding away.
*  Finally, Vera put down his gun.
*  Someone called an ambulance. Sebastián rushed outside. For a second Toledo still seemed very
*  much himself, his black running shoes still on his feet, his cigarettes and big pen still in his
*  pocket. Yet he was in a pool of blood. There were three bullet holes in his stomach, and others in
*  his arms, his sternum, and his shoulder. Bullet fragments were lodged in his heart, liver,
*  and intestines. He was saying something, but no one could hear him. Vera drew closer.
*  They got me, was all they heard. They got me.
*  Paramedics rushed Toledo to the hospital. For a moment, there was only silence in the newsroom.
*  Linares walked in the door, having rushed back from an interview in another part of town.
*  Except for him and Toledo, everyone was at their desks when the gunmen arrived.
*  Vera's pistol would have been no match for them, Vera thought.
*  If they had broken through, the entire newsroom would have been dead.
*  It was the only hopeful thought that Vera could muster at that moment.
*  But even that bit of solace was shattered when the phone rang.
*  Toledo had died on his way to the hospital.
*  Then came another blow. Detectives from the prosecutor's office, the very people Linares
*  had made his career denouncing as corrupt, were now setting up crime scene tape and collecting
*  shells. The officials asked for a statement, and Linares refused, saying he didn't trust them.
*  Then he went into his office, cried, collected himself, and finally approached Vera.
*  We can do a broadcast, he said in a low voice.
*  Vera looked at Linares, announcing the shooting online felt like a terrible idea.
*  No, leave it be, he said. They finished us. They finished us, old man. No broadcast.
*  This will only bring us problems. But Linares didn't care. He went into the transmission room
*  and started flipping on the switches to the computers and microphones. They came so naturally
*  to him, a process so wrought that for a moment he forgot that his camera operator was dead.
*  Delight Roberto. He calmed down before he realized his mistake.
*  My friends were going to broadcast now and it will be brief, he said into the camera.
*  Today a member of our team has been assassinated. His website had investigated the city's political
*  elite and had received death threats in return, he said. Now the newsroom had paid the price.
*  But they would not stop work, he said. They had a list of names of those behind the attack and
*  soon he warned. Information will be flowing. We're not armed. We don't carry weapons.
*  Our only defense is a pen, a pencil, and a notebook, he said, raising the spiral
*  pad that sat next to him. I regret this is how things are. That there are attempts to
*  destroy freedom of expression and the right to true and timely information.
*  I have pointed the finger at some people and some politicians. And today I will say it again.
*  I will keep reporting. I will keep after these people. And he added, we will take this
*  to the bitter end.
*  The People Will Protect Me
*  Liunaris' broadcast had barely begun to circulate on social media when another report emerged.
*  Investigators on the scene had found two notes, written on colorful poster board
*  left beside Toledo's body. One of them, signed by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, said,
*  This is what happens to lawyers who take on the cases of La Familia Michoacana, a rival cartel.
*  Vera found himself suddenly on the defensive. Many lawyers throughout Mexico had worked with
*  drug traffickers, at times legally, by defending members in court against charges, but sometimes
*  illegally, by setting up shell companies to launder drug proceeds, for example.
*  Vera had represented a number of business interests in Sitacuaro over the years,
*  including one of its bus companies. But never, he said, anything affiliated with organized crime.
*  If there had been any links, he told me, it would have been apparent to the journalists at the
*  monitor. Their newsroom shared an office with his firm.
*  It became clear to Vera that the notes were part of a broader campaign that evening,
*  when Ixlahuac himself gave an interview to reporters on Milenio Televisión,
*  a national cable news network.
*  I'd like to first make some clarifications, the mayor said of the killing.
*  The preliminary information that we have is that this wasn't a journalist. As the mayor spoke,
*  he repeated several times that the attack had occurred at a legal office,
*  and he never mentioned the monitor by name. Hector Zamarrón, one of the reporters,
*  looked skeptical, saying that Toledo had worked at the monitor.
*  The mayor replied that he hadn't found Toledo's name registered with the journalist's guild.
*  The other reporter, Paula Parquet, pointed out that Toledo had received death threats from the
*  work he had done. I don't know if he got threats or not, the mayor replied.
*  Reporters from Mexico City began to call Vera for comment. Had Toledo not been a journalist
*  after all? What did Vera make of the messages that seemed to have been left for him by the
*  cartel? The questions angered him. If these journalists in the capital had covered Zitacuaro
*  before this, they would have seen Toledo at work when he was alive. But the monitor had been one
*  of the few outlets on the ground and the only one investigating the mayor's office.
*  If Ixlahuac and his city officials had in fact ordered the attack to stop the negative coverage,
*  then claiming Toledo wasn't a journalist was simply a means to obscure the motive.
*  Vera thought about the messages left by the attackers. Crime scene evidence in Mexico
*  was typically confidential before a trial. Yet many reporters now seemed to know about the notes
*  claiming that Vera was working with a drug cartel. Vera suspected it was the prosecutor's office that
*  was leaking the information to discredit them. The monitor, rudderless in the hours since the
*  attack on its newsroom, was no longer in control of the news cycle in Zitacuaro.
*  The government was. And the narrative was this. The attack on the newsroom had nothing to do
*  with its journalism. The stories seemed to be solidifying at the highest level.
*  That afternoon, Jesús Ramírez Cuevas, the spokesman for López Obrador, had condemned
*  the assassination of the journalist Roberto Toledo in a statement from the president's office.
*  But that evening, he issued a new statement. According to judicial investigations, the citizen
*  Roberto Toledo, who was assassinated today, worked as an assistant in a lawyer's office,
*  not as a journalist. Vera decided that he would have to leave the task of correcting the record
*  for another day. So long as he and his team were in Zitacuaro, their lives remained in danger.
*  He called Linares and said they needed to leave town immediately.
*  We would be letting them win, Linares said. By then, the federal government had offered
*  Linares the possibility of extraction into a safe house. But putting himself in the hands of one
*  branch of government to protect himself from another seemed not just absurd,
*  but like a potentially deadly gamble. Vera was insistent. Whoever attacked the newsroom
*  had already won. Monitor Michoacán could no longer safely publish, he said. No story was
*  worth their lives. But Linares argued that his life wasn't in danger.
*  Don't be a fool, Vera replied. He was yelling now.
*  What would I do? Linares asked. How would I make my living?
*  Vera, realizing that his friends would be crushed if he lost his work, backed down.
*  Linares lived alone with two dogs. On some days, his sources were his only human contact.
*  Vera and Sebastián left Sitacuaro, deciding they would try to persuade Linares to join them later.
*  Linares, acting on his vow to take this to the bitter end, had spent the afternoon lining up
*  a long series of television and radio interviews in which he linked the local government to the
*  killing. In one, Linares repeated his claim that the mayor's office had been behind the threats,
*  adding that just a half hour before, his phone rang with another one. He did not hide the fact
*  that he had decided to remain in Sitacuaro. Some people of our team decided to leave today,
*  but some of us have to stay to continue this battle, he said.
*  As the days passed, Vera persuaded Linares to make a statement to the federal authorities in
*  Mexico City. It would be to the same federal officials who sent them back empty-handed
*  after the previous threats, but Linares realized there were few other options.
*  For about an hour, he gave his statement to investigators at the Free Speech Crimes Unit,
*  offering a list of officials in Sitacuaro who he said were behind the threatening messages.
*  He noted that the cartel had been clear in every call that the threat had come because
*  the monitor was screwing the government, and Toledo, he said again, was a journalist.
*  I want to state that I am scared, that I fear that they will come and attack me, he concluded.
*  That's all I wish to add.
*  The authorities again seemed unmoved. Linares was offered a referral to leave Sitacuaro,
*  but when he turned it down, he was not given other measures, like a government bodyguard
*  or a panic button typically provided to journalists who choose to stay in their hometowns.
*  The officials thanked him for his testimony and said they would be in touch if they had more
*  questions. After the interview, Linares and Vera, who had come along to support him,
*  went to a coffee shop near the prosecutor's office. Vera tried one more time to persuade
*  him to leave Sitacuaro. Linares said he would make it where he was. He had a following there,
*  especially in the indigenous community. The people will protect me, he said.
*  Later that month, investigators released Toledo's remains from custody and Vera paid the expenses
*  for them to be returned to his home state, Morelos, about a four-hour drive from Sitacuaro.
*  Vera, in hiding, watched over his Zoom call as a mariachi band played. Toledo's son lifted his
*  phone so Vera could see the coffin of his friend lowered into the ground.
*  Alone in the newsroom, Linares tried to create a semblance of normalcy. He did a broadcast from
*  the central plaza in the nearby town Ocampo to interview the mayor about remodeling the roof of
*  the town hall. He drove to the north of Sitacuaro to report from the crime scene of a nighttime
*  shooting. But he remained scared, and Vera remained frightened for him.
*  Finally, in March, a friend managed to change Linares' mind.
*  It would take just a few days to put together the money, and then he would flee.
*  No one will thank you.
*  On March 15th, two men on a motorcycle began to prowl the area around Linares' home.
*  It was just before lunchtime, and a nearby food vendor was hawking tacos and corn.
*  The motorcycle headed one direction, slowly, along north Dr. Emilio Garcia Street,
*  and then a minute later doubled back. The man riding on the back stepped off.
*  He was looking for Linares, he said to one of the neighbors.
*  He was a soccer fan and wanted to publish something in Monitor Michoacán.
*  Someone must have pointed to Linares' door.
*  At around 6 p.m., Linares posted an article about a motorcycle accident, then headed home.
*  As he approached his door, a man walked toward him wearing a black suit and a red tie.
*  The man greeted Linares, who looked up and greeted him back. They shook hands,
*  then spoke for a moment before heading inside Linares' apartment.
*  About five minutes later, the man in the suit was seen running from the building.
*  We'll never know what the two men discussed. We'll never know exactly when the man in the red tie
*  drew the gun he was hiding and fired it at Linares. The police found his body riddled with eight
*  rounds. It was 43 days after Toledo's murder. Now in hiding, Vera felt helpless. He had been
*  told by the police not to speak out about the monitor to avoid attracting attention from
*  criminal groups. Yet he needed somewhere to put his anger. So many times he and Linares had
*  discussed the importance of reporting done in the public interest. They once called themselves
*  soldiers of journalism and civil rights. They felt there had been an understanding
*  that should the monitor come under threat, those whom they had stood up for would come to their
*  defense. There would be marches, signs hung at the mayor's office. There would be something,
*  they thought. And yet, at his moment of need, Linares died alone and scared, himself accused
*  of ties to drug traffickers. You can write an article and give your life, and no one will thank
*  you. Vera told me. Is it worth publishing if it puts your life at risk?
*  I'm still thinking about that question. We said let's do it. Let's go. But now I wonder,
*  was this worth two dead colleagues?
*  The day after Linares' death, Vera decided to close Monitor Michoacan. There would be no more
*  visits to town hall and no more broadcasts from the transmission room. There would be no website
*  beyond a Facebook page. The years of investigations in Sitacuero would disappear from the internet.
*  Those who had attacked them had won. News was spreading about the murder of Linares.
*  Another local journalist began to hear rumors that more reporters would be killed. After seeing
*  motorcycles circling the neighborhood, the journalist fled. Soon afterward, another local
*  journalist did the same. The press corps in Sitacuero was dwindling.
*  Linares' funeral was held the day after his killing, at a funeral home a few blocks from
*  the municipal cemetery. It was a hot day for March, and the scent of roses and lilies hung in the air.
*  Most of the seats in the chapel were empty. Vera sent a wreath. He and Sebastián, once again,
*  watched a live stream from their government safe houses.
*  Linares' wife, Rosa Elena Pedraza, attended along with her children. When a cameraman from a national
*  news station approached her for an interview, she said she would talk, just not on camera.
*  He knew that his life was in danger, but his passion for speaking the truth pushed him never
*  to shut up. She said. The few people who had arrived didn't remain long, filing out to allow
*  Linares' family one last moment with his coffin. They too left, leaving a handful of reporters who
*  had come to cover the funeral. Minutes later, four unknown men arrived at the funeral.
*  One wore a leather jacket and a ski mask to cover his face. Holding a gun, he approached the
*  reporters and said, If you don't get out of here in two minutes, you're going to be sorry.
*  He didn't fire. The journalists left the funeral home.
*  I was not the mastermind. In February, just after the anniversary of Toledo's death,
*  I met Vera in Mexico City. I had been talking to him for several months. We would meet over Zoom
*  after he had breakfast and talk for an hour or two before making plans to speak again.
*  We sent each other Christmas greetings, asked after each other's families, but when I asked
*  him if we could meet at his safe house, he said he preferred to travel to the capital.
*  Vera wanted his location to remain unknown, even to me.
*  The buzzer rang at the office where we had agreed to meet, and Vera walked in,
*  holding a large stack of legal documents.
*  In the years since he fled Sitacuaro, he had become a kind of private investigator,
*  trying to gather what information he could about the deaths of Linares and Toledo.
*  He was forced to live in the shadow of incredible uncertainty. On one hand, he said, he believed it
*  was Sitacuaro's local government officials who orchestrated the killings of his colleagues.
*  On the other hand, the federal government was running the safe house that he was living in now.
*  Vera insisted that neither could be trusted to solve the murder cases.
*  There had been no arrests and little sign of investigation.
*  I want to show you whose side the government is on, Vera said. He pulled out a document,
*  sliding it across the table, a judicial decision about a wiretap that federal
*  investigators asked for before Linares' death. But the authorities hadn't only asked to listen
*  to the phones of the cartel man who had threatened them. They wanted to tap the phones of Vera
*  and Linares. A judge rejected the request, saying the victims of a crime
*  shouldn't be surveilled this way. Vera was convinced the investigators were
*  trying to gather dirt on him and Linares that would undermine them somehow.
*  We've been victimized twice now. First, directly by the attack. The deaths, everything.
*  And then the state is trying to cast doubt on us. He said,
*  they should be investigating these politicians, not Armando and me.
*  The next morning, I took a bus to the special prosecutors unit in charge of crimes against
*  free speech, the same office where Vera and Linares filed their original complaints.
*  Much had changed since their initial visit when they returned to Sitacuaro empty-handed.
*  With two journalists killed at the same outlet, the monitor's case had become one of the most
*  notorious to reach the office in years. Ricardo Sánchez Pérez del Pozo, the young prosecutor
*  who heads the office, greeted me formally and offered a description of the inner workings of
*  his unit. The department had been charged with, among other tasks, taking over investigations of
*  attacks on journalists when local investigators or elected officials might themselves be complicit.
*  He said that in this particular case, a group of experts had reviewed the work of Monitor
*  Michoacan, the threats and the evidence from the crime scene. What came next took me by surprise.
*  We determined that we are not taking on the case, he said of Toledo's death. Our analysis determined
*  that nothing he published, wrote or gave an opinion on as a journalist was linked to the
*  circumstances of his homicide. It was the same for Linares. I stopped the prosecutor for a moment.
*  I told him I had a copy of the state prosecutor's case file and it contained page upon page of
*  threats from an alleged cartel commander saying the Monitor needed to stop criticizing the
*  government or there would be consequences. There were screenshots of Linares' phone with the
*  WhatsApp messages. Sánchez seemed surprised that I had the documents and warned that they were
*  confidential. He said again that there was little evidence the crime had to do with journalism
*  and no need for him to take over the case. Michoacan's state prosecutor was handling the
*  case instead. That appeared to conclude the conversation. But as he packed up to head to a
*  hearing, I reminded Sánchez that the threats against the Monitor were sent to stop the
*  corruption investigations of the same prosecutor's office that was now assigned to solve their
*  killings. The office investigating the case had repeatedly been named as one of the suspects in
*  the attacks by Linares. Could they really be trusted to solve a crime that the newspaper had
*  accused them of being behind? Sánchez said he was only following the law. I can't change what's
*  in the Constitution, he told me on his way out. The state prosecutor's office never replied to
*  my requests for an interview. But Ixtlahuac, the mayor, agreed to answer my written questions
*  about Linares' accusations that he had ordered the attacks. I was not the mastermind or the man
*  behind the threats against Monitor Michoacan or any other media outlet, and for that matter,
*  I have no relationship with any person who calls himself the Eagle, Ixtlahuac wrote. In fact,
*  he wrote no investigator had ever questioned him in the case. Ixtlahuac offered his condolences
*  to the victims and said Monitor Michoacan's criticism of the local government had on occasion
*  pointed to legitimate problems he tried to fix as mayor. His office later sent a statement
*  calling most of the claims made by the outlet a lie. As for the armed cartel gunmen who were seen
*  at events during his campaign, Ixtlahuac wrote, the election had been a fair one, and if such
*  an assertion about links to armed groups carried any weight, the election would have gone the other
*  way. He had long been a target of dirty politics by his opponents, he wrote, including during his
*  initial arrest for supposedly working with a cartel in 2009. The former secretary of public
*  security who spearheaded his arrest was now being detained in the United States for his collaboration
*  with cartel groups, the mayor wrote, referring to the case of Genaro Garcia Luna while he himself
*  remained a free man. I knew the mayor's statement was true in at least one regard. Mexico's
*  government had been corrupted at almost nearly every level. Mexico is a hall of mirrors to any
*  journalist. It is so hard to tell who is telling the truth because the line between crime fighter
*  and criminal has become so blurred it often ceases to exist. The people who were supposed
*  to clarify that line were the local reporters at Monitor Michoacán, but of course, they too
*  were gone. Sitacuaro is a zone of silence.
*  The recent months have only left more cases piling up. On July 8th, the body of Luis Martín Sanchez
*  in Gies, a correspondence for the newspaper La Jornada, was found dead with signs of violence,
*  according to authorities in the state of Nayarit. A week later, Nelson Matos Peña,
*  a photographer and editor in Acapulco, was shot dead in his car. I knew Matos from when
*  he shot photos for an article I wrote about drug gang hits in 2011. One afternoon in August,
*  I was scanning the local papers in Mexico when I came across a headline. The police had captured
*  a suspect in Linadis' killing. It appeared to have happened somewhat by accident. He was caught
*  with two other gang members when their truck was seen speeding in front of a police station.
*  When the police ran his name, Carlos Gerardo Sánchez Mendoza, through the system,
*  they found an arrest warrant from the Michoacán Prosecutor's Office seeking him in connection
*  with the murder. The authorities said he had gone by the alias O2 as a member of the Jalisco New
*  Generation Cartel. Not long afterward, I received a message from Sebastián, the researcher at
*  Monitor Michoacán, who was on the other side of the door when Roberto Toledo was shot.
*  We had been in communication several times during my reporting, and I wanted to know if the news
*  had given him any sense of calm. It hadn't. Maybe Sánchez had pulled the trigger, he said,
*  but if he was the hitman, then who ordered the attack?
*  The arrest wasn't the only reason Sebastián had asked to speak that evening. He wanted to tell me
*  that the government agency in charge of the safe house that he was staying in had notified him that
*  he would no longer need their protection. The decision had happened before Sánchez's arrest,
*  so it was far from clear how the government concluded that the threat was gone.
*  Sebastián paused on the other end of the line, as though the news needed to sink in for him as well.
*  He had been in hiding for the better part of two years, and his wife and three-year-old son were
*  leading the same precarious life with him. He had felt a higher calling to be a journalist,
*  but that vanished long ago, replaced now by a simple desire for survival.
*  In many ways, it was the same in Cidad Cuero itself now.
*  A few reporters had stepped in to fill the vacuum left by those who fled,
*  and someone had even started posting regularly again on Morneito de Michoacán's Facebook page.
*  But the tone was different. The pigeons of Cidad Cuero also form part of the image of our city,
*  was what ran over a series of photos of birds in the city's main square.
*  There were no signs of the muckraking the outlet was known for.
*  Cidad Cuero is a zone of silence now, Sebastián said.
*  Sebastián was no longer a reporter, but he retained the gallows humor that has become so
*  common among journalists in Mexico. He would challenge the decision to end most of his
*  protection, he said, but even if he lost his safe house, he would still have his government issued
*  panic button. When the hitman comes and wants to kill me again, I'll tell him,
*  just give me a minute please hitman. Let me press my panic button.
