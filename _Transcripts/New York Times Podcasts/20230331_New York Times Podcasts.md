*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro.
*  This is a daily.
*  Today.
*  All right.
*  We're going to break in with this Fox News alert here.
*  We have just gotten word.
*  Former President Donald Trump has been indicted.
*  For the first time in U.S. history,
*  a former president has been indicted on criminal charges.
*  Is this, of course, is unprecedented?
*  The former president accused of paying $130,000 in hush money
*  to storming Daniels in the weeks before the 2016 presidential
*  election.
*  My calling, Ben Protess, on the case against Donald Trump.
*  And what happens next?
*  I just hung up with the former president.
*  And I asked that he planned to turn himself in.
*  He said, you take care, John.
*  And then he hung up on me.
*  It's Friday, March 31st.
*  Ben, it is late.
*  It is after 9pm.
*  It's been a very long day for you.
*  I know you're tired.
*  Thank you for making time for us.
*  My pleasure.
*  I want to begin, Ben, by just observing the enormity
*  of what has just happened.
*  Because for the past six years, we've
*  lived through an endless cycle of investigations
*  into Donald Trump.
*  Investigations into alleged campaign collusion with Russia,
*  investigations into tax evasion, January 6,
*  the mishandling of classified documents.
*  All of those could have theoretically
*  led to criminal charges, but so far haven't.
*  This time, in this investigation, it has.
*  And it feels huge.
*  It is huge.
*  I mean, I think everybody uses the word
*  unprecedented with this president.
*  There have been so many unprecedented things.
*  But in our 250 years of this country,
*  we've never had a president sitting
*  or a former who's been indicted.
*  And the fact that we now have that is remarkable.
*  It is unexpected in many ways.
*  Despite all the investigations you mentioned,
*  he's always managed to escape.
*  And now we've sort of burst that bubble.
*  And now that he's indicted, what is going to happen
*  in the next few hours, the next few days?
*  So we expect him to surrender to authorities
*  in Manhattan early next week.
*  Basically, what that means is that like any felony defendant,
*  he's going to be escorted into the bowels
*  of the New York State Courthouse in Laura Manhattan.
*  And he's going to be fingerprinted.
*  He's going to be photographed.
*  And he's going to have to wait there
*  until ultimately he's arraigned in a court.
*  Well, let's just spend a little bit of time
*  with the indictment itself in the simplest terms.
*  What exactly has Trump been charged with here?
*  So the story I broke a few hours ago with my colleagues,
*  including Willie Rashbaum and Jonah Bromwich,
*  basically says that the grand jury
*  has indicted Mr. Trump.
*  But the indictment is going to remain under seal
*  until he is arraigned in court.
*  So we don't get to know the specifics.
*  We don't get to know the charges.
*  But what we do know from our reporting
*  is that there are more than 2,000 charges.
*  Wow.
*  It's a huge number of charges.
*  Yeah.
*  And we also know that the Manhattan District Attorney, Alvin Bragg,
*  has built a case that likely centers on the accusation
*  that Mr. Trump falsified business records.
*  These are business records from his company.
*  And he did this a few years ago during the 2016
*  presidential campaign over a payment
*  to a porn star story Daniels.
*  Right.
*  A story we all know very well.
*  In fact, a story we know probably a lot better
*  than we wish we did.
*  But just remind us of the very basic elements of that story,
*  Stormy Daniels and Trump.
*  So flashback to 2006, Donald and Stormy meet,
*  according to Stormy, they have sex,
*  and they keep in touch over the ensuing months,
*  fast forward to the 2016 presidential campaign
*  about a decade later.
*  Right.
*  Trump and his people are suddenly afraid
*  that Stormy is going to tell all.
*  And that her story is going to be hugely damaging,
*  not just his personal life.
*  He was married at the time of the encounter with Miss Daniels,
*  but also to his campaign, which was already
*  reeling from other accusations.
*  Right.
*  So basically, Michael Cohen, who was Mr. Trump's fixer
*  at the time, comes up with $130,000 of his own money
*  to buy her silence.
*  He pays the $130,000 in hush money to basically ensure
*  that she's not going to tell her story.
*  And she does indeed keep quiet about it.
*  Trump, of course, wins the election.
*  And everything seems like it's dead and buried,
*  except that in 2018, federal prosecutors
*  in the Southern District of Manhattan
*  figure this out after the Wall Street Journal published
*  the story exposing the payoff to Miss Daniels.
*  And the federal prosecutors and the FBI
*  suddenly are now investigating Mr. Cohen,
*  and they're upending his life.
*  And in the course of that, they drilled down
*  these $130,000 payment to Miss Daniels.
*  And what they find out is that this payment was essentially
*  an illegal campaign donation to the Trump campaign.
*  And the reason for that is that when you're buying her silence,
*  you're helping the campaign, right?
*  You're keeping out a damaging piece of information
*  from voters' attention right before the election.
*  Right.
*  So that is an unrecorded and very excessive campaign donation
*  and Mr. Cohen pleads guilty.
*  And in this very dramatic moment, stands up in court
*  while he's pleading guilty and points the finger at the president
*  and says, I did this because I was directed to do it
*  by Mr. Trump.
*  Hmm.
*  And what remind us becomes of that finger pointing
*  by Cohen to the president of the United States?
*  So it's ultimately revealed that Trump reimbursed Cohen
*  for the money.
*  And Cohen goes on a publicity tour,
*  telling anyone who would listen, including Congress
*  and the prosecutors, that this was all orchestrated by Trump.
*  And the Trump knew that it was improperly covered up
*  in internal documents at the company.
*  But legally speaking, there's not much the prosecutors can do
*  because there's a longstanding justice to barman policy
*  that says you can't indict a sitting president.
*  Right.
*  So essentially from the public view,
*  that's where this hits a dead end.
*  Right.
*  I remember that really well.
*  It kind of ends as a salacious curiosity
*  involving the president that doesn't really
*  seem to be going anywhere.
*  So walk us through how and why this case of all cases
*  and this Manhattan district attorney of all prosecutors
*  ends up reviving this case that seemed very dead
*  because Trump was president and how
*  we get to this indictment, the first and only criminal
*  indictment of Donald Trump.
*  OK, so the feds closed the book on their case.
*  And just down the street is the Manhattan District Attorney's
*  Office.
*  They opened their own investigation into the Hush Money.
*  Originally, you have the DA Sy Vance, who initially opened
*  the investigation.
*  And the course of that, he subpoenaed Trump's tax returns.
*  They end up looking into a broader array
*  of Trump's business practices.
*  They looked into whether he lied on his financial statements.
*  And that was the case that everybody sort of thought
*  they were going to bring, not the Hush Money case,
*  but the new DA Alvin Bragg.
*  He sworn in early 2022.
*  And he inherits this case that was going to be focused
*  on Donald Trump's business practices
*  and whether he basically lied about his finances
*  for years and years.
*  He looks at that case and he says, yeah, Trump,
*  maybe he lied and falsified his financial records,
*  but we just don't have it yet.
*  We can't quite prove it.
*  And Bragg sort of decides, pump the brakes.
*  Well, the only problem is when he decided to pump the brakes,
*  he got a tremendous amount of blowback.
*  And everybody was wanting to know,
*  including in deep blue liberal Manhattan,
*  why did you, Alvin Bragg, the DA, we just elected,
*  not one who indict Donald Trump?
*  Right.
*  And in the course of the last few months,
*  the zombie case comes back.
*  This Hush Money case comes back from the dead once again.
*  And sure enough, over the course of the last several months,
*  they start examining new potential new theories
*  and how to revive the case.
*  And they impanel a grand jury in January.
*  And that's the same grand jury that just indicted him.
*  And then what made Bragg and made the lawyers in his office
*  think that this zombie case was worth pursuing?
*  What evidence did they have that made them want
*  to try to bring these charges?
*  They clearly feel that they have a deep body of evidence.
*  And a lot of that hinges on Michael Cohen.
*  So Cohen has met with the district attorney's office
*  20 times.
*  Wow.
*  He is testified for the grand jury twice for hours and hours.
*  And his story under oath is that Trump orchestrated this
*  and was aware of all of the illegal aspects of the Hush Money deal.
*  And how does the evidence that they have accumulated bring them
*  to charges?
*  I know we don't know the charges, but to the degree
*  that you based on your reporting, think you understand the charges.
*  Help us understand how what Michael Cohen has been telling
*  the district attorney might create these charges.
*  It all comes down to how Michael Cohen was reimbursed
*  for the money he paid Stormy Daniels.
*  So the Hush Money was paid by Cohen,
*  but he was paid back by Trump.
*  And while President sign checks to Cohen
*  paying back for all that money, and internally
*  in the Trump organization, they have these records that falsely
*  say that the money had to do with legal expenses
*  and that it had to do with a retainer agreement that Cohen had
*  with them.
*  The problem was, of course, there was no retainer agreement.
*  It was totally bogus.
*  There are no legal expenses, at least not in 2017
*  when he was repaid.
*  This all had to do with Hush Money that Cohen had paid
*  Stormy Daniels.
*  And so if the whole thing was work affiction,
*  and if the whole thing was according to Cohen fraudulent,
*  then that's what the district attorney
*  is going to build his case route.
*  OK, so the alleged crime here, what is behind this indictment,
*  we think, is the fraudulent claim of what this money was for.
*  It's in actuality paying off Daniels,
*  but Trump lies and says he's just paying his lawyer's fees.
*  Correct.
*  And so the case could be built not just on Cohen's testimony,
*  but on the checks themselves, the Trump side,
*  and on the documents that show that the Trump organization
*  improperly and falsely recorded for these payments
*  as legal expenses, which is just not true.
*  And so ultimately, the case is very likely
*  to come down to the falsification of those business records,
*  which in the state of New York is a crime.
*  And it is a felony if you're using those false business records
*  to commit or conceal a second crime.
*  In this case, probably an election law violation.
*  OK, explain that.
*  So they might be able to prove a crime of financial fraud
*  from Trump lying about what this money was for allegedly.
*  What might be the second crime that would make this all a felony?
*  Sure.
*  So if the first crime is lying about what the money was for,
*  and these false business records, the second crime very well
*  could be that he was using those false business records
*  to cover up a campaign finance crime.
*  And in this case, that would be that Cohen paid money
*  to Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet about a potential affair
*  and alleged affair.
*  And that was essentially a huge contribution to Trump's campaign.
*  And the problem is that contribution was not recorded anywhere.
*  And it was way in excess of what you're
*  allowed to donate to a campaign.
*  And in New York state, there are campaign finance laws
*  just like there are federally.
*  And if it ran a foul of those laws,
*  that could be the second crime that the Trump organization
*  and that Trump were essentially covering up.
*  So the second crime involved here, which
*  could be the one that makes that financial crime a felony,
*  sounds familiar.
*  And that is because it is the crime that Michael Cohen
*  already pled guilty to.
*  Exactly.
*  So then important question, how strong a case is this,
*  based on your reporting?
*  I mean, I wouldn't call it a slam dunk,
*  but put yourself in the shoes of a juror in Manhattan,
*  who is evaluating a payment to a porn star that was covered up
*  and lied about that potentially affected
*  the outcome of the 2016 election.
*  Did I mention Manhattan, where people don't love the poor
*  president?
*  Yes.
*  And I think that the prosecution feels pretty strongly
*  that it has a provable case.
*  That does not mean, however, that it does not have its challenges.
*  We'll do it back.
*  Then right before the break, you said that the district attorney's office
*  thinks it has a reasonably strong case,
*  but that there are challenges that it faces in bringing it.
*  So what are those challenges?
*  Yeah.
*  So the first part of the case is not so hard.
*  It's the bread and butter of the DA's office.
*  They're bringing the accusation that Trump and his company essentially
*  falsified business records.
*  Nothing strange about that.
*  But to make that case a felony, as we discussed,
*  you have to have that second charge.
*  And that's a little bit trickier.
*  What do you mean?
*  Why?
*  So if we're right, and the second crime is a campaign finance violation,
*  then what's tricky here is that you have New York State prosecutors
*  building a case in part around a violation of New York State election law,
*  basically that this was an illegal campaign donation to the Trump campaign.
*  But it was not a state campaign, right?
*  It was a presidential campaign.
*  It was a federal campaign.
*  So you're having this unusual, potentially unprecedented,
*  mixing of New York State election law and a federal campaign.
*  Right.
*  It's not as clean as most cases might be where it's state law,
*  alleged state crime.
*  This is a little bit funkier, you're saying.
*  It's a little bit funkier.
*  And as far as we can tell, this has never been tested.
*  Because remember in the Michael Cohen case,
*  that was entirely a federal case.
*  Those were federal charges and dealing with a federal campaign.
*  Here, we're talking about state charges,
*  dealing with a federal campaign.
*  Right.
*  And listen, when you're bringing criminal charges against
*  the former president of the United States,
*  who's now running once again, it is challenging to bring a case
*  that has never before been tested through the courts.
*  That doesn't mean that they won't win.
*  That doesn't mean that there's not a lot of evidence suggesting
*  that he will be convicted.
*  It just means it's a challenge.
*  Right.
*  What should we make of the fact that this grand jury
*  brought this indictment?
*  I mean, does that tell us anything about the strengths of the case
*  or is that a misreading of how important and clear
*  a grand jury indictment actually is?
*  Well, the adage is that a grand jury will indict a ham sandwich.
*  And Donald Trump has many things he's not a ham sandwich.
*  But this is still a lower bar, a lower threshold.
*  Basically, you needed a majority of the grand jurors
*  to vote in favor of indicting him.
*  Whereas, obviously, you need a unanimous jury to convict him.
*  And a trial, you're going to have to prove the case
*  beyond a reasonable doubt.
*  And here, it's a lower standard.
*  So you should not infer just from his indictment
*  that he is going to be convicted.
*  But I do think what it does show is that they were able
*  to convince the majority of these jurors
*  that this case should be brought.
*  And certainly, they built a case that suggests
*  that the president potentially committed these crimes.
*  Then I think that a question on a lot of people's minds
*  as they absorb this indictment and everything you have just said
*  is why did the Manhattan D.A. decide to bring this case?
*  It's an old case.
*  It involves this intimate, pottery, personal story.
*  And from what you're saying, it's built
*  on a pretty untested legal theory.
*  And it could fail.
*  So why this one?
*  Well, in terms of whether or not to bring the case at all,
*  I think that if the D.A. were asked this question,
*  he would say that the rule of law applies to anyone.
*  It doesn't matter if you're the former president,
*  or someone off the street.
*  It's that the law needs to be upheld.
*  And if they have the facts and the evidence
*  to prove their case that they should proceed.
*  Right.
*  But of course, the very nature of this case
*  then is what invites Republicans to say that it's a witch
*  on, right?
*  Because it involves an affair because it's old.
*  Because it comes from a democratic district attorney
*  who already experienced blowback for not bringing
*  a different set of charges.
*  Bragg has to know that all of this is setting him up
*  to seem to many Republicans like a partisan who's out
*  to get Trump.
*  Well, the Republicans are going to say
*  that this is a witch hunt no matter what the case is.
*  And let's be honest, Bragg, the D.A.'s case,
*  may not be the last case that we see against Donald Trump.
*  We may see future indictments of him
*  unrelated to this in different jurisdictions.
*  But all that's going to really matters
*  what people in the jury box think
*  and they're the ones who ultimately decide his fate.
*  Right.
*  Well, let's turn to the next phase of all of this.
*  Because as you already hinted at the next few days,
*  the next few weeks, they're going to be very strange.
*  But the real drama, of course, is going to be this trial.
*  And assuming that Trump doesn't plead guilty
*  and there's no reason to think he will,
*  what would the timetable for that trial be?
*  We have this potential extraordinary timetable.
*  If we know one thing about Donald Trump's legal strategy,
*  it's delay, delay, delay.
*  And so I think that this could be likely delayed well into 2024.
*  We could be looking at a trial nine months, 12 months away.
*  And of course, that would raise this extraordinary prospect
*  of having a trial unfolding against the backdrop
*  of a presidential campaign, a campaign in which
*  the defendant very well could be either the leading contender
*  or even the nominee of his party.
*  And if Trump has found guilty in a trial, in the middle of a campaign,
*  what kind of a sentence could he be looking at potentially?
*  If a jury finds him guilty, it'll be entirely up
*  to the judge to decide what to do.
*  The judge would not need to impose prison sentence,
*  but he could face up to four years in prison.
*  Wow.
*  So it is possible that we could have a convicted former president
*  headed for some prison sentence running for president
*  in the middle of 2024.
*  Correct.
*  But to be clear, you do not need to have a clean criminal record
*  to be able to hold the office of the presidency.
*  In other words, Trump could be convicted
*  and still be reelected.
*  Correct.
*  Under the Constitution, that's the deal.
*  It's like unprecedented on top of unprecedented on top
*  of unprecedented.
*  Everything about this case feels totally historic.
*  And that's because it is.
*  Well, Ben, thank you very much for appreciate it.
*  Thank you.
*  In a statement released on Thursday night,
*  Trump called the indictment, quote,
*  political persecution and election interference
*  at the highest level in history,
*  called the Manhattan District Attorney
*  who brought the case against him, a disgrace,
*  and described himself as a completely innocent person.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Thank you.
*  Here's what else you need to know day.
*  Today is a tough and a tragic day for Kentucky,
*  for the Fort Campbell, and for the 101st.
*  Nine soldiers have died after the US Army helicopters
*  they were riding in collided during a training mission
*  along the border of Tennessee and Kentucky,
*  whose governor Andy Beshear spoke about the accident
*  on Thursday.
*  The crash, which occurred late Wednesday night,
*  involved two black hawk assault helicopters
*  that took off from Fort Campbell.
*  The cause of the collision is under investigation.
*  We are blessed to live in the freest country
*  in the history of planet Earth, but we must remember
*  that that freedom relies on those who are willing to serve,
*  some of which pay the ultimate price.
*  And Russia has detained an American journalist
*  for the Wall Street Journal, accusing him
*  without providing any evidence of espionage
*  in a major escalation of its wartime tactics
*  against foreign media.
*  The reporter, Evan Gerskavitch, who is based in Moscow,
*  is believed to be the first American journalist
*  held as an accused spy inside Russia
*  since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
*  The journal, vehemently denied Russia's claims
*  that Gerskavitch is a spy and called for his immediate release.
