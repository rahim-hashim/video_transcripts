# The Indictment of Donald Trump
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vopEC32egGw)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is a daily.
*  Today.
*  All right, we're going to break in with this Fox News alert here.
*  We have just gotten word former President Donald Trump has been indicted.
*  For the first time in U.S. history, a former president has been indicted on criminal charges.
*  This of course is unprecedented.
*  The former president accused of paying $130,000 in hush money to Stormy Daniels in the weeks
*  before the 2016 presidential election.
*  My colleague Ben protested on the case against Donald Trump.
*  And what happens next?
*  I just hung up with the former president and I asked does he plan to turn himself in?
*  He said, you take care, John.
*  And then he hung up on me.
*  This Friday, March 31st.
*  Ben, it is late.
*  It is after nine p.m.
*  It's been a very long day for you.
*  I know you're tired.
*  Thank you for making time for us.
*  My pleasure.
*  I want to begin, Ben, by just observing the enormity of what has just happened.
*  Because for the past six years, we've lived through an endless cycle of investigations
*  into Donald Trump.
*  Investigation into alleged campaign collusion with Russia, investigations into tax evasion,
*  January 6th, the mishandling of classified documents.
*  All of those could have theoretically led to criminal charges, but so far haven't.
*  This time, in this investigation, it has.
*  And it feels huge.
*  It is huge.
*  I mean, I think everybody uses the word unprecedented with this president.
*  There have been so many unprecedented things, but in our 250 years of this country, we've
*  never had a president sitting or former who's been indicted.
*  And the fact that we now have that is remarkable.
*  It is unexpected in many ways.
*  Despite all the investigations you mentioned, he's always managed to escape.
*  And now we've sort of burst that bubble.
*  And now that he's indicted, what is going to happen in the next few hours, the next
*  few days?
*  So we expect him to surrender to authorities in Manhattan early next week.
*  Basically what that means is that, like any felony defendant, he's going to be escorted
*  into the bowels of the New York State Courthouse in lower Manhattan, and he's going to be fingerprinted.
*  He's going to be photographed.
*  And he's going to have to wait there until ultimately he's arraigned in court.
*  Well let's just spend a little bit of time with the indictment itself.
*  In the simplest terms, what exactly has Trump been charged with here?
*  So the story I broke a few hours ago with my colleagues, including Willy Raschbaum and
*  Jonah Bromwich, basically says that the grand jury has indicted Mr. Trump, but the indictment
*  is going to remain under seal until he is arraigned in court.
*  So we don't get to know the specifics.
*  We don't get to know the charges.
*  But what we do know from our reporting is that there are more than two dozen charges.
*  Wow.
*  It's a huge number of charges.
*  Yeah.
*  And we also know that the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has built a case that
*  likely centers on the accusation that Mr. Trump falsified business records.
*  These are business records from his company.
*  And he did this a few years ago during the 2016 presidential campaign over a payment
*  to a porn star, Stormy Daniels.
*  Right.
*  A story we all know very well.
*  In fact, a story we know probably a lot better than we wish we did.
*  But just remind us of the very basic elements of that story, Stormy Daniels and Trump.
*  So flashback to 2006.
*  Donald and Stormy meet.
*  According to Stormy, they have sex and they keep in touch over the ensuing months.
*  Fast forward to the 2016 presidential campaign about a decade later.
*  Right.
*  Trump and his people are suddenly afraid that Stormy is going to tell all and that
*  her story is going to be hugely damaging, not just to his personal life.
*  He was married at the time of the encounter with Ms. Daniels, but also to his campaign,
*  which was already reeling from other accusations.
*  Right.
*  So basically, Michael Cohen, who was Mr. Trump's fixer at the time, comes up with $130,000
*  of his own money to buy her silence.
*  He pays the $130,000 in hush money to basically ensure that she's not going to tell her story.
*  And she does indeed keep quiet about it.
*  Trump, of course, wins the election and everything seems like it's dead and buried.
*  Except that in 2018, federal prosecutors in the Southern District of Manhattan figure
*  this out after the Wall Street Journal published the story exposing the payoff to Ms. Daniels.
*  And the federal prosecutors and the FBI suddenly are now investigating Mr. Cohen and they're
*  upending his life.
*  And in the course of that, they drill down on the $130,000 payment to Ms. Daniels.
*  And what they find out is that this payment was essentially an illegal campaign donation
*  to the Trump campaign.
*  And the reason for that is that when you're buying her silence, you're helping the campaign,
*  right?
*  You're keeping out a damaging piece of information from voters' attention right before the election.
*  So that is an unrecorded and very excessive campaign donation.
*  And Mr. Cohen pleads guilty and in this very dramatic moment stands up in court while he's
*  pleading guilty and points the finger at the president and says, I did this because I was
*  directed to do it by Mr. Trump.
*  And what, remind us, becomes of that finger pointing by Cohen to the president of the
*  United States?
*  So it's ultimately revealed that Trump reimbursed Cohen for the money and Cohen goes on a publicity
*  tour telling anyone who would listen, including Congress and the prosecutors, that this was
*  all orchestrated by Trump and that Trump knew that it was improperly covered up in internal
*  documents at the company.
*  But legally speaking, there's not much the prosecutors can do because there's a long
*  standing Justice Department policy that says you can't indict a sitting president.
*  So essentially from the public view, that's where this hits a dead end.
*  Right.
*  I remember that really well.
*  It kind of ends as a salacious curiosity involving the president that doesn't really seem to
*  be going anywhere.
*  So walk us through how and why this case of all cases and this Manhattan district attorney
*  of all prosecutors ends up reviving this case that seemed very dead because Trump was president
*  and how we get to this indictment, the first and only criminal indictment of Donald Trump.
*  Okay, so the feds closed the book on their case and just down the street is the Manhattan
*  district attorney's office.
*  They opened their own investigation into the hush money.
*  Originally you had the DA, Cy Vance, who initially opened the investigation.
*  In the course of that, he subpoenaed Trump's tax returns.
*  They end up looking into a broader array of Trump's business practices.
*  They looked into whether he lied on his financial statements and that was the case that everybody
*  sort of thought they were going to bring.
*  Not the hush money case, but the new DA Alvin Bragg.
*  He's sworn in early 2022 and he inherits this case that was going to be focused on Donald
*  Trump's business practices and whether he basically lied about his finances for years
*  and years.
*  He looks at that case and he says, yeah, Trump, maybe he lied and falsified his financial
*  records, but we just don't have it yet.
*  We can't quite prove it.
*  And Bragg sort of decides, pump the brakes.
*  Well, the only problem is when he decided to pump the brakes, he got a tremendous amount
*  of blowback and everybody was wanting to know, including in deep blue liberal Manhattan,
*  why did you, Alvin Bragg, the DA we just elected, not want to indict Donald Trump?
*  And in the course of the last few months, the zombie case comes back.
*  This hush money case comes back from the dead once again.
*  And sure enough, over the course of the last several months, they start examining new potential
*  new theories and how to revive the case and they impale a grand jury in January.
*  And that's the same grand jury that just indicted him.
*  And then what made Bragg and made the lawyers in his office think that this zombie case
*  was worth pursuing?
*  What evidence did they have that made them want to try to bring these charges?
*  They clearly feel that they have a deep body of evidence and a lot of that hinges on Michael
*  Cohen.
*  So Cohen has met with the district attorney's office 20 times.
*  He has testified before the grand jury twice for hours and hours.
*  And his story under oath is that Trump orchestrated this and was aware of all of the illegal
*  aspects of the hush money deal.
*  And how does the evidence that they have accumulated bring them to charges?
*  I know we don't know the charges, but to the degree that you based on your reporting think
*  you understand the charges, help us understand how what Michael Cohen has been telling the
*  district attorney might create these charges.
*  It all comes down to how Michael Cohen was reimbursed for the money he paid Stormy Daniels.
*  So the hush money was paid by Cohen, but he was paid back by Trump.
*  And Trump, while president, signed checks to Cohen paying back for all that money.
*  And internally in the Trump Organization, they have these records that falsely say that
*  the money had to do with legal expenses and that it had to do with a retainer agreement
*  that Cohen had with them.
*  The problem was, of course, there was no retainer agreement.
*  It was totally bogus.
*  There were no legal expenses, at least not in 2017 when he was repaid.
*  This all had to do with hush money that Cohen had paid Stormy Daniels.
*  And so if the whole thing was a work of fiction and if the whole thing was, according to Cohen,
*  fraudulent, then that's what the district attorney is going to build his case around.
*  OK, so the alleged crime here, what is behind this indictment, we think, is the fraudulent
*  claim of what this money was for.
*  In actuality, paying off Daniels.
*  But Trump lies and says he's just paying his lawyer's fees.
*  Correct.
*  And so the case could be built not just on Cohen's testimony, but on the checks themselves
*  that Trump signed and on the documents that show that the Trump Organization improperly
*  and falsely recorded for these payments as legal expenses, which is just not true.
*  And so ultimately, the case is very likely to come down to the falsification of those
*  business records, which in the state of New York is a crime and it is a felony if you're
*  using those false business records to commit or conceal a second crime, in this case, probably
*  an election law violation.
*  OK, explain that.
*  So they might be able to prove a crime of financial fraud from Trump lying about what
*  this money was for, allegedly.
*  What might be the second crime that would make this all a felony?
*  Sure.
*  The first crime is lying about what the money was for and these false business records.
*  The second crime very well could be that he was using those false business records to
*  cover up a campaign finance crime.
*  And in this case, that would be that Cohen paid money to Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet
*  about a potential affair, an alleged affair, and that that was essentially a huge contribution
*  to Trump's campaign.
*  The problem is that contribution was not recorded anywhere and it was way in excess of what
*  you're allowed to donate to a campaign.
*  And in New York state, there are campaign finance laws just like there are federally.
*  And if it ran afoul of those laws, that could be the second crime that the Trump organization
*  and that Trump were essentially covering up.
*  So the second crime involved here, which could be the one that makes that financial crime
*  a felony, sounds familiar and that is because it is the crime that Michael Cohen already
*  pled guilty to.
*  Exactly.
*  So Ben, important question.
*  How strong a case is this based on your reporting?
*  I mean, I wouldn't call it a slam dunk, but put yourself in the shoes of a juror in Manhattan
*  who is evaluating a payment to a porn star that was covered up and lied about that potentially
*  affected the outcome of the 2016 election.
*  Did I mention Manhattan, where people don't love the former president?
*  Yes.
*  And I think that the prosecution feels pretty strongly that it has a provable case.
*  That does not mean, however, that it does not have its challenges.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Ben, right before the break, you said that the district attorney's office thinks it has
*  a reasonably strong case, but that there are challenges that it faces in bringing it.
*  So what are those challenges?
*  Yeah.
*  So the first part of the case is not so hard.
*  It's the bread and butter of the DA's office.
*  They're bringing the accusation that Trump and his company essentially falsified business
*  records.
*  Nothing strange about that.
*  But to make that case a felony, as we discussed, you have to have that second charge.
*  And that's a little bit trickier.
*  What do you mean?
*  Why?
*  So if we're right and the second crime is a campaign finance violation, then what's
*  tricky here is that you have New York state prosecutors building a case in part around
*  a violation of New York state election law, basically that this was an illegal campaign
*  donation to the Trump campaign.
*  But it was not a state campaign, right?
*  It was a presidential campaign.
*  It was a federal campaign.
*  So you're having this unusual, potentially unprecedented mixing of New York state election
*  law and a federal campaign.
*  Right.
*  It's not as clean as most cases might be where it's state law, alleged state crime.
*  This is a little bit funkier, you're saying.
*  It's a little bit funkier.
*  And as far as we can tell, this has never been tested.
*  Because remember, in the Michael Cohen case, that was entirely a federal case.
*  Those were federal charges and dealing with a federal campaign.
*  Here we're talking about state charges dealing with a federal campaign.
*  Right.
*  When you're bringing criminal charges against the former president of the United States,
*  who's now running once again, it is challenging to bring a case that has never before been
*  tested through the courts.
*  That doesn't mean that they won't win.
*  That doesn't mean that there's not a lot of evidence suggesting that he will be convicted.
*  It just means it's a challenge.
*  Right.
*  What should we make of the fact that this grand jury brought this indictment?
*  Does that tell us anything about the strength of the case?
*  Or is that a misreading of how important and clear a grand jury indictment actually is?
*  Well the adage is that a grand jury will indict a ham sandwich.
*  And Donald Trump has many things, he's not a ham sandwich.
*  But this is still a lower bar, a lower threshold.
*  Basically you needed a majority of the grand jurors to vote in favor of indicting him.
*  Whereas obviously you need a unanimous jury to convict him.
*  And at trial you're going to have to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.
*  From here it's a lower standard.
*  So you should not infer just from his indictment that he is going to be convicted.
*  But I do think what it does show is that they were able to convince a majority of these
*  jurors that this case should be brought.
*  And certainly they built a case that suggests that the president potentially committed these
*  crimes.
*  Ben, I think that a question on a lot of people's minds as they absorb this indictment and everything
*  is why did the Manhattan DA decide to bring this case?
*  It's an old case, it involves this intimate, tawdry personal story.
*  And from what you're saying it's built on a pretty untested legal theory.
*  And it could fail.
*  So why this one?
*  Well in terms of whether or not to bring the case at all, I think that if the DA were asked
*  this question he would say that the rule of law applies to anyone.
*  It doesn't matter if you're the former president or someone off the street.
*  It's that the law needs to be upheld and if they have the facts and the evidence to prove
*  their case that they should proceed.
*  Right.
*  But of course the very nature of this case, Ben, is what invites Republicans to say that
*  it's a witch hunt.
*  Because it involves an affair, because it's old, because it comes from a Democratic district
*  attorney who already experienced blowback for not bringing a different set of charges.
*  Bragg has to know that all of this is setting him up to seem to many Republicans like a
*  partisan who's out to get Trump.
*  Well the Republicans are going to say that this is a witch hunt no matter what the case
*  is.
*  And let's be honest, Bragg, the DA's case may not be the last case that we see against
*  Donald Trump.
*  We may see future indictments of him unrelated to this in different jurisdictions.
*  But all that's going to really matter is what people in the jury box think and they're the
*  ones who ultimately decide his fate.
*  Right.
*  Well let's turn to the next phase of all of this.
*  Because as you already hinted at, the next few days, the next few weeks, they're going
*  to be very strange.
*  But the real drama, of course, is going to be this trial.
*  And assuming that Trump doesn't plead guilty and there's no reason to think he will, what
*  would the timetable for that trial be?
*  We have this potential extraordinary timetable.
*  If we know one thing about Donald Trump's legal strategy, it's delay, delay, delay.
*  And so I think that this could be likely delayed well into 2024.
*  We could be looking at a trial nine months, 12 months away.
*  And of course, that would raise this extraordinary prospect of having a trial unfolding against
*  the backdrop of a presidential campaign, a campaign in which the defendant very well
*  could be either the leading contender or even the nominee of his party.
*  And if Trump is found guilty in a trial, in the middle of a campaign, what kind of a sentence
*  could he be looking at, potentially?
*  If a jury finds him guilty, it'll be entirely up to the judge to decide what to do.
*  The judge would not need to impose prison sentence, but he could face up to four years in prison.
*  Wow.
*  So it is possible that we could have a convicted former president headed for some prison sentence
*  running for president in the middle of 2024.
*  Correct.
*  But to be clear, you do not need to have a clean criminal record to be able to hold the
*  office of the presidency.
*  In other words, Trump could be convicted and still be reelected.
*  Correct.
*  Under the Constitution, that's the deal.
*  It's like unprecedented on top of unprecedented on top of unprecedented.
*  Everything about this case feels totally historic, and that's because it is.
*  Well Ben, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you.
*  In a statement released on Thursday night, Trump called the indictment, quote, political
*  persecution and election interference at the highest level in history, called the Manhattan
*  district attorney who brought the case against him a disgrace and described himself as a
*  completely innocent person.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Today is a tough and a tragic day for Kentucky, for the Fort Campbell and for the hundred
*  and first nine soldiers have died after the U.S.
*  Army helicopters they were riding in collided during a training mission along the border
*  of Tennessee and Kentucky, whose governor, Andy Beshear, spoke about the accident on
*  Thursday.
*  The crash, which occurred late Wednesday night, involved two Black Hawk assault helicopters
*  that took off from Fort Campbell.
*  The cause of the collision is under investigation.
*  We are blessed to live in the freest country in the history of planet Earth, but we must
*  remember that that freedom relies on those who are willing to serve, some of which pay
*  the ultimate price.
*  And Russia has detained an American journalist for the Wall Street Journal, accusing him
*  without providing any evidence of espionage in a major escalation of its wartime tactics
*  against foreign media.
*  The reporter, Evan Gurskavich, who is based in Moscow, is believed to be the first American
*  journalist held as an accused spy inside Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
*  The Journal vehemently denied Russia's claims that Gurskavich is a spy and called for his
*  immediate release.
