# Trump Wins Broad Immunity
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YUElG_O328)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that former President Trump is entitled to broad immunity
*  from criminal prosecution for actions that he took while in office.
*  My colleague Adam Liptak explains how that ruling will weaken the federal case against
*  Trump for trying to overturn the last election, and will dramatically expand the power of
*  the presidency itself.
*  It's Tuesday, July 2nd.
*  Adam, within the past few days, former President Trump experienced a major political victory
*  at the first presidential debate against President Biden, who did quite badly, and now Trump
*  has won a major legal victory at the Supreme Court.
*  He's having a good week, and the Supreme Court on Monday severely undermined a case that
*  really troubles former President Trump.
*  And so he's got political victories, and he might even say that he's got a constitutional
*  victory because the court in large part embraced his version of presidential power.
*  Okay, and we're going to get to all the details of this ruling.
*  I want to remind listeners about the origins of this case.
*  It begins with the events leading up to January 6th, and it has had a pretty long journey
*  to the high court.
*  Right, the special counsel, Jack Smith, indicted former President Trump for what Smith said
*  were Trump's efforts to subvert the 2020 election.
*  That case was chugging along until Trump's lawyers went to the district court and said,
*  wait a second, the president has constitutional immunity from prosecution, at least for his
*  official acts.
*  And that argument was rejected by the trial judge, by a unanimous three-judge panel of
*  the D.C. circuit.
*  And then it goes to the Supreme Court, where people, and I got to say including me, didn't
*  think Trump had the best chance of prevailing.
*  But when the case was argued, the right side of the court, the sixth justice conservative
*  supermajority, seemed quite taken by Trump's arguments.
*  And what was it about Trump's arguments that seemed to find sympathetic ears among the
*  conservative justices once the case reached the court that these lower court judges completely
*  rejected?
*  The conservative justices looked at the case as presenting an abstract question about the
*  scope of presidential power and the role of the president in the constitutional structure.
*  And that was quite different from what the lower courts had thought about.
*  They were looking at the particular facts of the case and asking whether Trump's alleged
*  conduct was so unprecedented that you have to focus on those allegations.
*  Whatever the general idea is about presidential power, these lower court judges thought there
*  needs to be an exception when the former president is accused of having used his office to undermine
*  democracy itself.
*  Got it.
*  Right.
*  Okay.
*  I think that brings us to Monday's ruling.
*  So tell us how the justices ended up weighing these two very different arguments.
*  The justices split six-three along the usual lines, which is to say the six Republican
*  appointees in the majority, the three Democratic appointees in dissent, and the majority more
*  or less adopts the Trump view.
*  It says we're talking about a case that will affect any occupant of the Oval Office.
*  This is not a Donald Trump case, that the Constitution requires an energetic, vigorous,
*  independent president who is not concerned about being potentially criminally prosecuted
*  for things he did in office.
*  So what they rule is that the president has immunity for his official conduct, and that
*  official conduct is defined quite broadly to the outer perimeter of his official duties.
*  And the court draws some distinctions.
*  There are some core activities of the presidency, commander in chief, the pardon power, and
*  so on, where it truly is absolute.
*  And they give an example of that kind of truly absolute power.
*  If you're discussing with your own attorney general what official actions to bring, even
*  in connection with the election, that's absolutely immune.
*  Other official conduct, they say, is presumptively immune, but even that is a really high standard
*  because they say what they mean by presumptive immunity is that prosecutors have to show
*  that the prosecution wouldn't endanger or even get near any official conduct.
*  So the bottom line is, so long as it's official conduct, there is a very, very high barrier
*  to any kind of prosecution.
*  Okay, so that is an extremely broad sounding level of immunity that the Supreme Court has
*  just conferred on the day-to-day official actions of a president.
*  So I want to further define this concept of official acts, especially this phrase of
*  the outer perimeter of official duties and understand just how wide that perimeter is.
*  And let me be super specific because as this case has made its way up to the Supreme Court,
*  the hypothetical that is evoked time and again is of a president using his or her official
*  authority to perhaps order the assassination of a political rival and then claim, well,
*  that was an official act because as president, I have power over the military.
*  Does this ruling seem to apply that immunity to an action like that?
*  So the majority doesn't deal with that precise scenario, but the logic of it is that if it's
*  part of the president's official duties, he's commander in chief, he's the chief law enforcement
*  officer, and if it's a plausible application of his official responsibilities, then yes,
*  he would be immune even for things as wild as ordering an assassination.
*  So this immunity is entirely separate and apart from whatever the motivation of the
*  president is in taking an official act that might ordinarily be seen as criminal and prosecutable.
*  So Michael, Chief Justice Roberts actually answers in so many words the question you
*  just asked.
*  He says, in dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the president's
*  motives.
*  Such an inquiry would risk exposing even the most obvious instances of official conduct
*  to judicial examination on the mere allegation of improper purpose.
*  So they really want to insulate the president from prosecution and from courts second guessing
*  the president's thinking.
*  Wow.
*  I mean, a truly profound view of the president's power and immunity from criminal prosecution.
*  Why would the majority embrace that really, really robust view of presidential power and
*  legal immunity?
*  What's the legal theory that Roberts and the majority lay out to justify it?
*  They say that the Constitution contemplates a very powerful chief executive, that it imbues
*  him with power, that it makes him the head of one of the three branches of government,
*  and that ideas like the separation of powers insulate him from either Congress passing
*  laws that would subject him to criminal prosecution or the courts deciding whether he has crossed
*  lines into illegality.
*  It feels like that view of presidential immunity is all about getting out of the president's
*  way, keeping the legal system out of the president's hair, and it would seem to assume a general
*  law abiding this and even, dare I say, morality from the presidency.
*  It doesn't seem to really want to grapple with the idea that a president would blatantly
*  stray into open lawlessness in his or her official acts.
*  Roberts writes that this is the first time a prosecutor is taught to charge a former
*  president with a crime.
*  He seems to say that that means there's something wrong with this prosecution.
*  Another way to look at it, Michael, is that this may be the first president who did engage
*  in the kind of, as you put it, lawless conduct that would demand accountability, at least
*  after he leaves office.
*  We have been talking about official acts and the immunity that this decision confers on
*  them from a president, Adam.
*  What does this ruling say about unofficial acts?
*  And what even is an unofficial act according to this ruling that, if done, might subject
*  a president to criminal prosecution?
*  So the decision doesn't get into or give particular examples of unofficial private conduct, but
*  it's not hard to think about it.
*  I mean, there are things that are completely divorced from the president's official duties.
*  Let's assume Trump was involved in a business deal that gave rise to illegality, didn't
*  pay his taxes, was involved in a car accident.
*  So there is a narrow category of things, but they are all, the Supreme Court suggests,
*  wholly divorced from, entirely separate from, outside the outer perimeter of the president's
*  official conduct.
*  All to say there is a sphere of decision making that could get a president prosecuted, criminally
*  charged after they leave office, but it sounds quite narrow.
*  That's right.
*  The majority leaves very little room to hold former presidents accountable for asserted
*  criminal conduct.
*  And the dissent is very aware of this.
*  I mean, this gives you a sense of just how big a deal this decision is.
*  Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in her dissent, says the majority has done the following.
*  The relationship between the president and the people he serves has shifted irrevocably.
*  In every use of official power, the president is now a king above the law.
*  So if you think about it as a matter of like constitutional theory, the gap between the
*  majority and the dissent could not be bigger.
*  The disagreement about whether former presidents can be held to account is enormous.
*  But the dissent is also keenly aware of a practical point that this ruling will make
*  the possibility of prosecuting former President Trump ever, and certainly before the coming
*  election, very, very difficult.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Adam, let's turn to the very specific question of how, as you just said before the
*  break, this Supreme Court ruling is going to make it harder for the special counsel
*  to prosecute Trump for seeking to overturn the 2020 election.
*  Right.
*  So as we've been saying, Michael, the basic question is, is the conduct official or unofficial?
*  And the Supreme Court sets out some guidelines, some ideas about what falls on which side
*  of the balance, but it says it's not going to do the work itself.
*  It's going to send back to the trial judge, Judge Tanya Chutkin, who's been supervising
*  this case, what the Supreme Court says is a difficult and fact intensive and presumably
*  time consuming job in which she will have to decide what is absolutely immune from prosecution,
*  what is official conduct that is presumptively immune from prosecution, and what is purely
*  private conduct.
*  And the Supreme Court draws some faint lines and it starts to say that, well, one thing
*  we know is absolutely immune from prosecution is the president's communications with the
*  Justice Department.
*  The Justice Department reports to him that's official.
*  And of course, that would seem important because President Trump communicated a good deal with
*  his Department of Justice in his effort to interfere with the 2020 election.
*  I recall him trying to install a favored attorney general towards the end of his presidency,
*  who he thought would do his bidding in the effort to overturn the election.
*  So that seems like a pretty big sphere to exempt from the special counsel's prosecution.
*  Quite right.
*  But I guess I'd say that if you put aside what happened and the particulars of it and
*  Donald Trump and that shadow Attorney General Jeff Clark, most people, if you were to ask
*  them the abstract question of is the president of the United States allowed to appoint his
*  own attorney general might say, yes, that's part of his official duties.
*  So you can disagree given the particular circumstances here.
*  But viewed as an abstract question, it's not wholly crazy to think that's official.
*  OK.
*  What other guidance does the court give in terms of what is immune or not immune in the
*  special counsel's January 6th case?
*  Another example is former President Trump's communications with his vice president, Mike
*  Pence.
*  And there the sense is that that's probably immune.
*  But the court says it's complicated.
*  We're going to presume it's immune.
*  And maybe the prosecutors can come up with some way of overcoming that presumption.
*  But it sure seems to be sending the signal that there too, that's official and therefore
*  exempt from prosecution.
*  And again, that's meaningful as a piece of evidence in the special counsel's case because
*  President Trump was repeatedly pressuring his vice president to not sign off on the
*  transfer of power from Trump to Biden.
*  And he was constantly pushing Pence to agree to a scheme of alternative delegates who might
*  keep Biden from becoming the president.
*  So right.
*  So in these two areas already, and we've just talked about two, the court seems to be cutting
*  major pieces out of the indictment and out of the case against Donald Trump.
*  I'm curious what actions the president took around January 6th that this ruling specifies
*  as not being subject to this immunity.
*  So the majority opinion doesn't say for sure that any particular act is unofficial conduct
*  and therefore prosecutable.
*  But it does suggest that it's at least possible that say some of what Trump said on January
*  6th might be unofficial conduct, that some of his contacts with, say, state election
*  officials, not part of his administration, might be unofficial conduct.
*  But it will be up to prosecutors to overcome a presumption that all of that is official
*  conduct and it will be up to the trial judge to decide who's right.
*  But all of this is the beginning of a very long process.
*  Right.
*  That word long process is important because when it comes to the January 6th prosecution,
*  we have always understood the special counsel's desire to bring this case and have it adjudicated
*  before Donald Trump could win reelection and use his power as president to theoretically
*  intervene in and interfere with the prosecution of him as president.
*  What critics of Donald Trump have long hoped for is that there would be before the election
*  a trial not only to hold Trump criminally accountable as they think he should be, but
*  also to let the American people have a look at all of the evidence against Trump in this
*  sphere.
*  And that prospect seems to be evaporating before our eyes.
*  In short, this ruling clearly kneecaps much of the January 6th prosecution against Trump.
*  It may even end that prosecution if Trump gets reelected.
*  And just to go back to the majority's logic in this ruling that it's so much bigger than
*  Trump and it's so much bigger than the January 6th case, it's about presidential power.
*  I wonder if that means the majority is kind of willfully ignoring the reality of what
*  their ruling on Monday means for the specific case before them, the January 6th prosecution,
*  or perhaps just not caring about that.
*  I think there's a bunch of things that the court, maybe properly, maybe not, doesn't
*  seem to care about.
*  It doesn't care about the fact that its public approval ratings have dropped precipitously,
*  and this case is not going to help among major parts of the American public.
*  It doesn't seem to care that two members of the majority, Justices Clarence Thomas and
*  Samuel Alito, have faced calls for their recusal.
*  And it doesn't care about the election.
*  It doesn't view this as an election case.
*  It views this as a major case on presidential power.
*  And it's made almost no efforts to send it back to the trial court in time for it to
*  have a trial before the election.
*  It expedited the case a little bit, but not very much, issued its decision on the very
*  last day of the term.
*  And all of this speaks to a court that views itself as deciding important but quite abstract
*  legal questions.
*  Well, if we take the conservative majority at its word, Adam, and believe that they are
*  making this big abstract ruling in the name of preserving or expanding presidential power
*  and protections, it strikes me that Donald Trump is benefiting mightily from the Supreme
*  Court's inclination to see its decisions as affecting all presidents, not just him.
*  And assuming, as it seems to do in this ruling, that your average president is going to be
*  law-abiding rather than law-challenging or violating.
*  It is certainly a gift to Donald Trump.
*  And the majority would say he's the incidental beneficiary of an important broad ruling about
*  presidential power.
*  It would be easier to take that point of view seriously if the gift came from the entire
*  Supreme Court rather than from a part of the Supreme Court, precisely the six justices
*  named by Republican presidents over the vehement objections of the three justices named by
*  Democratic presidents.
*  So I would like to think that this is a good faith dispute unrelated to the particular
*  consequences in the particular case about Donald Trump.
*  But that lineup challenges my wish to think that both sides are operating in perfect
*  good faith.
*  Another way to think about this ruling, if you step way back, is that it's kind of a
*  Supreme Court saying that when you elect a president, you have to accept, dear American
*  people, that the Constitution gives them a tremendous amount of power and legal latitude
*  to kind of do what they want under this rubric of official acts.
*  And we, the Supreme Court, are going to make it pretty hard to hold that president criminally
*  responsible for their actions.
*  So voters need to think really carefully about who they want to possess this level of immunity.
*  I mean, the ruling doesn't say that, of course, but it's the only logical conclusion to come
*  to.
*  I think that's right.
*  And it's also the case that the court authentically wants to protect every president, including
*  Joe Biden.
*  Let's assume a world in which Biden loses, Trump wins, and Trump follows through on thinly
*  veiled threats to exact retribution from his political rivals and tries to prosecute Biden.
*  This ruling would very much protect Biden.
*  And Chief Justice Roberts writes that presidents take many controversial and unpopular acts
*  that are not hard to characterize as criminal.
*  Do you want the next president to be prosecuting the former one that's never been part of the
*  American legal tradition?
*  So this is good, I suppose, for outgoing presidents who will not be prosecuted by their political
*  rivals over what they did in office.
*  But it does a second thing.
*  It emboldens the next president and the president after that to test the boundaries of presidential
*  power because they'll know that the Supreme Court has said there is almost nothing they
*  can do in an arguably official way that will ever cause them to be prosecuted criminally
*  after they leave office.
*  Well, Adam, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  On Monday afternoon, both President Biden and former President Trump issued statements
*  reacting to the court's ruling.
*  Trump celebrated the decision, calling it, quote, a big win for our constitution and
*  democracy.
*  The Biden campaign denounced it, saying that the court had, quote, handed Donald Trump
*  the keys to a dictatorship.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Hurricane Barrel, the first category four storm to ever materialize this early in the
*  hurricane season, made landfall Monday on Karaku, a small island north of Grenada.
*  The result was extraordinary devastation across the island.
*  Hurricane Barrel shocked meteorologists because it strengthened from a tropical depression
*  into a major hurricane in just 42 hours, a direct result of higher than normal water
*  temperatures throughout the region.
*  And House Republicans have sued the U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland in an effort to obtain
*  audio recordings of President Biden's interview with a special counsel who raised questions
*  about Biden's memory and mental fitness.
*  If successful, the lawsuit would give Republicans embarrassing audio to use against Biden at
*  a time when his debate performance has put his age at the center of the presidential
*  race.
