# Biden, Trump and a Split Screen at the Texas Border
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnO2dD9MFZE)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  On Thursday, the two presumptive nominees for president, Joe Biden and Donald Trump,
*  traveled to Texas, where they gave dueling speeches on what is shaping up to be perhaps
*  the most important issue in the 2024 election.
*  The flow of migrants across the border.
*  Today, my colleague, White House correspondent, Zolan Kenno-Youngs, on Biden's risky bid
*  to take Trump's biggest advantage and use it against him.
*  It's Friday, March 1st.
*  So Zolan, both President Biden and former President Trump visited the border in Texas
*  on Thursday, and you know, it's 6 p.m., they just finished talking.
*  And it was kind of this split screen performance, right?
*  These dueling speeches, one after the other.
*  Tell us what happened.
*  Well, these dueling trips to the border really do show us that we are in the general election
*  at this point.
*  The fact that both of the likely nominees chose to travel to the border really does
*  show you just how much immigration has rise to be one of the most important concerns amongst
*  voters.
*  And recent polling also shows that.
*  And that coincides with a record number of crossings at the southwest border.
*  And it's not just limited to states along the border, but you have migrant surges in
*  cities throughout the United States.
*  It's increasingly becoming a huge political vulnerability for the White House.
*  And you see the former president trying to seize on that vulnerability.
*  OK, so that's why these two men go down there.
*  What do they say when they're down there?
*  Describe the scene for me.
*  What you saw were two different leaders who, in very different ways, tried to convince
*  Americans that they are best suited to address this humanitarian issue.
*  That's great, Governor.
*  Thank you very much, everybody.
*  This is an honor to be with you.
*  So for the former president, he goes to Eagle Pass, Texas, standing just near the Rio Grande.
*  He's near a makeshift border barrier topped with razor wire as well.
*  So you see the optics of trying to look tough on the border.
*  And he once again tried to seize on this issue to stoke division and hate.
*  A man, an alien in Louisiana, was arrested for brutally raping a 14-year-old girl while
*  holding a knife to her throat.
*  And he then allegedly robbed a man who was getting out of his car in front of his home
*  and repeatedly stabbed him in the face, in the back, in the face many, many times.
*  And he even used sort of warlike language when describing this issue.
*  And I'll say this.
*  It's a military operation.
*  He called it a military operation.
*  I mean, we have a military...this is like a war.
*  So you definitely saw the former president sort of return to that anti-immigration strategy
*  to attack Democrats.
*  It's an honor to have your support and your endorsement and likewise, me to you.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Great to be here.
*  Thank you.
*  So essentially today we saw Trump being Trump on immigration, you know, doubling down on
*  the same demagoguery that he's been using really since he first declared his run for
*  the presidency back in 2016.
*  Right.
*  The rhetoric is familiar, but let's be clear what the former president is planning if he's
*  elected would go even further than the policies that we saw when he was in office.
*  My colleagues have reported already that former President Trump is drawing up policies that
*  take his immigration crackdown even further.
*  He's planning on sending agents out into the country to round up undocumented immigrants,
*  scale up as well, giant camps to detain undocumented immigrants, reinstitute travel bans as well,
*  including the travel bans that were against Muslim majority countries when he was in office.
*  They're even considering trying to end birthright citizenship, which basically says that babies
*  born in the United States to undocumented parents would be entitled to American citizenship.
*  Without a doubt, while former President Trump's remarks today may seem familiar, you should
*  know that what he's planning if he's elected to office would take his anti-immigration
*  agenda a step further.
*  Okay, so that's the Trump side of the split screen.
*  What did Biden do?
*  So in a way, when you look at President Biden's remarks, it was very different.
*  Hello, folks.
*  Good afternoon.
*  For one, he wasn't in front of barriers or razor wire.
*  He was inside a government facility standing alongside border patrol agents outlining a
*  bill that was recently negotiated in the Senate.
*  Then months ago, my team began a serious negotiation in a bipartisan group of senators, Democrat
*  leading conservative Republicans.
*  This legislation would have enacted some of the more conservative changes to the border
*  that we've seen in decades.
*  It's the toughest set of border security reforms we've ever seen in this country.
*  It's pretty basic.
*  Rapidly turning away migrants at the border, also making it more difficult for migrants
*  to obtain asylum at the border, as well as bolstering resources at the border.
*  It had a lot of the measures that Republicans have been calling for for years.
*  But House Republicans taking a cue from former President Trump tanked that legislation.
*  Many of them would prefer that it was an issue that could be used to attack the president
*  and didn't want to deliver him a policy win in an election year.
*  And today you saw President Biden criticizing them for it.
*  It's time for the speakers and some of my Republican friends in Congress who are blocking
*  this bill to show a little spine.
*  Saying that they were putting politics over actually solutions to this.
*  Let's remember who we work for, for God's sake.
*  We work for the American people.
*  But then towards the end of his remarks.
*  I understand my predecessor's legal past today.
*  So here's what I would say to Mr. Trump.
*  We heard something that I haven't heard before, a direct dare to former President Trump to
*  actually join President Biden in working together to actually address this issue.
*  Join me or I'll join you in telling the Congress to pass this bipartisan border security bill.
*  We can do it together.
*  You know, and I know it's the toughest, most efficient, most effective border security
*  bill this country has ever seen.
*  And there you really see possibly more so than we've seen thus far in the Biden era.
*  Biden directly challenging the border security bona fides of the former president.
*  There's nothing, nothing beyond our capacity, nothing when we work together.
*  And if all things we should be working together on is this, we have the formula to get it
*  done.
*  God bless you all.
*  May God protect our border patrol and God protect our troops.
*  Now I'd like to turn this over to Secretary Mayorkas.
*  Thank you.
*  As someone who's been covering this, you know, for some years now, I didn't expect
*  something that was as direct as those comments today.
*  And it not only shows just how much Democrats are sort of intent on emphasizing border security
*  in this election season, but it also affirmed that the White House is really going to lean
*  into the strategy of going on the offensive on border security.
*  So this is interesting.
*  So Biden is not only saying that he too cares about border security and he wants to really
*  crack down on crossings, you know, something we haven't heard from Democrats so much of
*  late.
*  But now he's turning it around on the Republicans, right?
*  Actually going on the offensive saying, you know, not only am I tough on this, they're
*  actually weak on this.
*  Like they're the ones who won't do anything to fix it.
*  They're the problem.
*  It's on them.
*  They're the ones that are neglecting this crisis.
*  We are the ones that are actually proposing solutions for this.
*  But I have to say, this is really going to be challenging for the White House and President
*  Biden.
*  You have this sort of real difficult balancing act of explaining the legislative challenges
*  and talking about your legislative proposals for this crisis.
*  But that's going up against Trump's strategy of stoking division and stoking anger on this
*  issue.
*  Former President Trump has proven that he can galvanize his base with his strategy,
*  whether or not this works.
*  That's something to watch moving forward.
*  Right.
*  It's kind of a triple axel, right?
*  Like when you think about it, he's trying to get a regular voter to see the border crisis,
*  to look at what's happening on the border.
*  And instead of just blaming the guy in charge, him, he's asking that voter to understand
*  that there was this bipartisan bill in Congress, that Biden himself had endorsed it, was prepared
*  to sign it, that, you know, he would have been tough on border issues, but that the
*  Republicans wouldn't bring it to a vote because Trump didn't want them to.
*  You know, it's not a simple message.
*  It's much easier for Trump.
*  All he has to do is say, hey, the border's a mess.
*  The other guy's in charge.
*  Blame him.
*  Yes, I think that's right.
*  Even listening to his remarks today, there's layers to it, right?
*  He's sort of trying to outline the legislative challenges here, which is, to be fair, very
*  Biden.
*  But without a doubt, what was surprising again is, for most of his time in office, immigration
*  and the border has been a thorn in the president's side, almost a political headache, something
*  that Democrats tried to distance themselves from.
*  Now you're seeing them lean in and emphasize border security and almost say, we are the
*  ones that will address this issue.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Zolan, how did we get here?
*  I mean, how did we go from Biden avoiding this immigration issue like the plague to
*  kind of tiptoeing into it to now trying to use it as a cudgel against Trump?
*  I mean, to understand this, you really have to go back to Biden's 2020 campaign.
*  We believe in freedom of religion.
*  That's why we'll end the Muslim ban.
*  This was, of course, after the anti-immigration agenda that President Trump implemented that
*  included a travel ban against Muslim majority countries.
*  They got separated from their parents.
*  And it makes us a laughing stock and violates every notion of who we are as a nation.
*  And that included extreme policies at the border, such as family separation, that Democrats
*  spent their time during the 2020 campaign condemning.
*  So of course, coming into office, you had Democrats using language that was much more
*  pro-immigration.
*  Within 100 days, I'm going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship
*  for over 11 million undocumented people.
*  You heard the president pledge to restore humanity, order, compassion to the immigration
*  system.
*  And those who come seeking asylum, we should immediately have the capacity to absorb them,
*  keep them safe until they can be heard.
*  But practically on the ground, there were some Trump-era policies that did stay in place.
*  That included something known as Title 42.
*  This was a pandemic emergency rule that essentially sealed the border to asylum seekers.
*  The administration also began to deport Haitian migrants back to Haiti as well.
*  There were photos of border patrol agents trying to keep migrants from entering into
*  the country.
*  Right, I remember that.
*  So while rhetorically we were hearing often about compassion and humanity, on the ground,
*  we were seeing once again a reliance on deterrence.
*  Okay, so during the campaign in 2020, he was kind of speaking the language of the left
*  in large part as a reaction to the extreme policies that Trump had enacted.
*  But he quickly moderated.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  And even though some of those policies were in place, the number of crossings continued
*  to grow.
*  Some of that's outside of the president's control.
*  I mean, in the wake of the pandemic, of climate change, of a global migration trend, as well
*  as the perception that the election of President Biden would mean a more welcoming approach
*  to the border, you had nationalities from all over the world attempting to cross into
*  the United States.
*  And so as this problem continued to grow worse and crossings continued to surge, the pressure
*  is really building on the White House.
*  Republicans relentlessly are asking President Biden when he's going to go to the border.
*  I was actually with Vice President Kamala Harris when she traveled to Guatemala to address
*  the root causes of migration.
*  And even there, she was being asked, why are you here and not at the U.S.-Mexico border?
*  And initially, you know, those requests were dismissed by top White House officials as
*  that's just going to be sort of political theater.
*  But eventually, they did succumb to the pressure and each make a visit to the border.
*  So Biden and Harris go to the border eventually, but there's a real reluctance to engage with
*  this at all publicly.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  So Republicans at the time really did sense an opening.
*  And in the spring of 2022, we have a pivotal moment that we all know well by now.
*  This is when Texas Governor Greg Abbott starts to put vulnerable migrant families and bus
*  them to cities led by Democrats.
*  This continues to escalate.
*  I remember getting a call one morning from a source who said that a bus of migrants had
*  been dropped off in front of the vice president's residence as well.
*  Oh, my goodness.
*  And, you know, it is important to remember, much of this was happening without giving
*  a heads up to some of the organizations or officials in these cities.
*  One result, though, is this only exacerbates a humanitarian crisis, but also a political
*  crisis for the White House.
*  And it causes, of course, a crisis for these cities, right?
*  I mean, we've covered this in New York.
*  Eric Adams and Governor Hockel, you know, are up in arms.
*  They're demanding funding from the federal government.
*  They're even going to Mexico to say, don't come.
*  Exactly.
*  So now you have Democratic mayors that are saying they're concerned not just about their
*  municipal budgets, but also the political pressure that they are facing as well as more
*  and more migrants are bussed into these cities.
*  And as a result, many of those Democratic leaders turn that pressure back on the White
*  House and say, we need to get some control over this issue.
*  Right.
*  They're criticizing the Biden administration directly.
*  Like it's not just Republican officials.
*  It's his own party coming after him for this.
*  That's exactly right.
*  And look, after a legal fight, Title 42 was lifted and the administration is scrambling
*  for solutions to the border.
*  And then this interesting thing happens, which is that the issue of the border no longer
*  just impacts immigration and the president's domestic agenda, but also threatens to impact
*  his foreign policy agenda.
*  Biden and the White House have seen rallying support for Ukraine as one of his crowning
*  achievements, but Republicans increasingly make it clear that if he wants to continue
*  to do that, they will only support him if he moves forward with changes at the border.
*  So while it might've seemed like the Republicans were actually forcing Biden to address the
*  border, actually Biden wanted to address the border for all the reasons you're describing.
*  And this was his chance to do it.
*  Right.
*  So publicly you would hear the White House at this point say, look, we need to pass this
*  aid for Ukraine.
*  Lives are at stake overseas.
*  And the White House officials think that's true.
*  Absolutely.
*  But I also talked to president's allies, to Democrats who were saying, hey, look, these
*  negotiations here actually may present an opportunity.
*  This may be a way to enact some of the policies that maybe in closed door meetings we've discussed
*  that we want, that we need, but in the past couldn't speak about publicly because of the
*  backlash you would get from immigration advocates and the progressive flank of the party.
*  But also it could be a way for the president to say, look, Republicans, you guys have criticized
*  me over this crisis throughout my presidency.
*  Well here's a solution.
*  It not only will be key for my foreign policy agenda, but it also is a way to actually implement
*  some of the restrictions that have been so polarizing within the party in past years.
*  But now is the time where we have an opportunity to implement some of those border restrictions.
*  So Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans at this point are working out a bill that
*  would turn away.
*  Many asylum seekers make it harder to gain asylum while increasing resources at the border.
*  The White House is sort of behind Senate Democrats continuing to support that bill.
*  And you're also seeing the president lean in a bit more into these negotiations.
*  Towards the end of last year, while facing questions from reporters, there was a pivotal
*  moment where he said, no, I am open to significant compromises at the border.
*  Yeah.
*  So this is the big shift, right?
*  I mean, Biden is now seeing the immigration issue and he's endorsing some very, very restrictive
*  policies on the border, not as a concession he's willing to make, you know, just to get
*  Ukraine funding.
*  He's actually seeing these very restrictive policies as good politics for him within his
*  own party.
*  Right.
*  And we continue to see the White House go even further in this direction.
*  The House Republicans think this bill, taking a cue from former President Trump, who preferred
*  that it be an issue to be used against the White House rather than a policy win for President
*  Biden, you start to see the White House continue to lean in.
*  He echoes the language once used by the Trump administration saying, look, if you had sent
*  me this bill, I would shut down the border.
*  And that leads to today where you have really seen them try to attempt this offensive strategy.
*  Remember, visiting the border was once something that was almost taboo within the party.
*  You did it when you faced calls to visit.
*  But now you have President Biden going, using the border as a backdrop and saying, no longer
*  will the Democratic Party be accused of not putting forward solutions to this crisis.
*  But actually, it's the Republicans that are neglecting what is one of the more pressing
*  issues in this nation.
*  OK, so that explains why Biden had decided to go on the offensive on this issue.
*  But as we said, this is very hard, right?
*  So let's play this out.
*  If this somehow works, what will Biden's immigration strategy actually look like?
*  I mean, for Biden to be on the offensive on this difficult issue as the campaign really
*  ramps up?
*  Well, I think that you can expect him to continue to call Congress to do something about this.
*  But let's be clear, they are considering going at this themselves as well.
*  My colleagues and I reported last week that the White House right now is considering executive
*  actions that would essentially replicate some of what was being negotiated in that Senate
*  bipartisan bill.
*  So that includes measures that would make it harder for migrants to obtain asylum at
*  the border and essentially allowing the president to shut down the border if crossings surpassed
*  a certain amount.
*  So that would be, I mean, a drastic change.
*  Very radical.
*  Right.
*  I mean, it would be some of the most conservative restrictive changes we've seen definitely
*  under the Biden White House.
*  But this is challenging.
*  This is tricky, right?
*  So really throughout the Biden presidency, Republicans have been saying there's more
*  you can do on the border by yourself, even though the president has said Congress needs
*  to take action on this issue.
*  Basically making the point that, hey, Guy, if you're doing this now, why didn't you do
*  it three years ago?
*  Right?
*  Why didn't you do it three years ago?
*  Right.
*  And I've already been told by border patrol agents and Trump allies that that is something
*  they would question the White House on if they issue these executive actions.
*  And then also, he would face pressure as well from the progressive flank of his party.
*  You already have progressives that have said this strategy by the White House is sort of
*  playing a game designed by Republicans in a way.
*  Remember, progressives and Democrats have historically called for legalization as a
*  trade-off for border security.
*  So if he moves forward with these actions, you have to wonder, would he face even more
*  pressure from the progressive flank of his party?
*  So he's getting squeezed politically.
*  And then even if he was going to take action here, there's also a question about whether
*  he would even be able to implement it.
*  Executive actions when it comes to immigration often run into legal trouble.
*  They often run into the courts.
*  So even if he were to go at it alone, you're likely going to see a legal fight ensue.
*  OK, so this is very fraught on a number of different fronts.
*  And if it kind of backfires, really, it leaves him out there in the wind, drawing lots of
*  attention to his biggest vulnerability in front of the whole country.
*  He could end up looking really bad, not just to the people who want him to be tough on
*  the border, but also to the progressives who are mad that he's trying to do this in the
*  first place.
*  I think that's right.
*  I mean, one thing that is certain about this shift, this strategy by the White House is
*  it's going to put the spotlight on this crisis.
*  It's going to put the spotlight on this issue.
*  It's going to put the spotlight on a policy that historically Republicans have wanted
*  more attention on.
*  So look, the White House has been squeezed on the border and immigration since President
*  Biden came into office.
*  There's no easy solutions for really addressing it.
*  And all of that amounts to why it's one of the more frustrating issues that he currently
*  has.
*  But then again, if and it's a big if, of course, Biden is able to pull off that high wire act
*  of turning this issue back on the Republicans and Trump specifically, it will have neutralized
*  what has been a very potent issue for the Republicans, which would kind of justify the
*  risk, right?
*  I think that's right.
*  And that's certainly what the White House is hoping for.
*  This is all part of an effort to sort of do a course correction in a way and sort of meet
*  Americans where they're at.
*  And, you know, polls indicate that Americans do want more restrictions at the border.
*  Just recent polling this week showed that immigration has surpassed the economy as the
*  most important issue right now in this election cycle.
*  Other polling as well showed that Americans do support some of the measures, the restrictive
*  measures that were in that bipartisan Senate bill.
*  So you can see sort of why the White House is attempting this shift.
*  So actually, weirdly, this issue that's been so contentious in our country is becoming
*  something of a consensus issue.
*  In a way, yeah.
*  I mean, I still think this is one of the more intractable, divisive issues facing the country.
*  Many public officials prefer to attack their opponents over it rather than actually solve
*  it.
*  But moving beyond just the politics, moving beyond just today, look, you're right.
*  There's increasing support for border security measures in this country when you look at
*  both parties.
*  And when you have the two leaders of each respective party that are both emphasizing
*  that they are the right ones to implement those border security measures, it's safe
*  to assume that there's increasing momentum for major changes to the way that our country
*  welcomes asylum seekers at the border.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  A federal court blocked a Texas law that would allow state and local police officers to arrest
*  migrants crossing in from Mexico without authorization.
*  The law had been set to take effect on March 5th.
*  The ruling was a victory for the Biden administration, which had argued that the law would violate
*  federal statutes and the Constitution, which gives authority over immigration matters to
*  the federal government.
*  Texas Governor Greg Abbott has aggressively worked to create a state-level system of border
*  enforcement.
*  He said he would appeal the decision immediately.
*  And a convoy of trucks carrying food aid into Gaza City was overrun by thousands of desperate
*  Gazans in the early hours of Thursday morning, prompting chaos and a response from nearby
*  Israeli soldiers that left more than 100 people dead and another 700 wounded.
*  The details of what happened were still unclear as of Thursday night.
*  Gazan authorities blamed the Israeli soldiers, saying that the deaths were caused by gunshot
*  wounds.
*  Israeli officials countered, saying that the majority of those who had died had been killed
*  in a stampede several hundred yards away.
*  Gazans in the north of the territory have become increasingly desperate for food, as
*  the United Nations and other relief groups have been largely unable to bring supplies
*  due to impassable roads, risk for military operations, and increasingly lawlessness and
*  breakdown of social order after nearly five months of war.
