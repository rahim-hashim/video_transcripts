*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro.
*  This is a daily.
*  Over the past week in Sudan, a closely watched plan to create a democracy has instead turned
*  into a deadly civil war.
*  Today, my colleague, Declan Walsh, on the personal rivalry at the center of the conflict.
*  It's Monday, April 24.
*  So Declan described the scene in Sudan's capital over the past few days.
*  Well, Michael, it started for me with a text message.
*  It was last Saturday morning.
*  I was at home.
*  I got a message from a friend of mine in Cartoum, which is the capital of Sudan.
*  And the message said, war has just erupted in Cartoum.
*  And then he went on to explain that his house is about 400 meters from a military camp in
*  the city that had come under attack.
*  And he sent me a clip of a recording he'd made out the window of his house.
*  And the clip went, pup, pup, pup, pup, with gunfire.
*  And I guess that was the starting gun for what has become this crazy descent into violence
*  that has consumed the capital of Sudan and spread across the entire country.
*  Within the hours that followed that, everything moves incredibly quickly.
*  There is fighting around the presidential palace, the headquarters of the military,
*  but the international airport passengers are taking cover on the ground of the terminal
*  because there's fighting and bombs outside.
*  You get war planes that start quizzing over the city, firing rockets and dropping bombs.
*  And you get these small street-to-street battles flaring everywhere in residential neighborhoods
*  on the main bridges that cross the Nile and the city everywhere.
*  And over the last week, this temple has continued.
*  We have been hearing very loud gunfire and shootings all over the city.
*  And in the middle of it, you've got millions of citizens who've been trapped in their homes
*  cowering against this violence.
*  Now we stay without electric, without water, without bread, without anything.
*  So we need somebody to help us, please.
*  Slowly running out of food and water.
*  Now we are imprisoned in Khartoum in this situation.
*  And in recent days, trying to figure out whether they should be trying to escape the city.
*  And at the heart of this conflict are two figures.
*  They're the Army Chief General Abdul Fatal Al-Berhan.
*  And a man called Lieutenant General Muhammad Hamdan, better known by everybody as Hemati,
*  who heads this much smaller but very powerful paramilitary group called the Rapid Support Forces.
*  Now these two groups are two branches of Sudan's military.
*  And all the fighting that's taking place is between soldiers of these two rival units
*  of the same military.
*  So this is essentially a civil war within Sudan's military that is playing out in a very
*  painful way across the capital city, which sounds absolutely terrifying.
*  I'm trying to think of the equivalent in a place like the US.
*  And all I can imagine is something like the army going to war with the Marines in Washington,
*  DC.
*  And that would be nightmarishly awful.
*  Absolutely.
*  It's just as bad as that.
*  I mean, the great tragedy of a Michael is that, you know, this was the moment when Sudan
*  was supposed to be moving away from military rule.
*  And instead the country finds itself in what everybody feared was this nightmare scenario
*  tumbling into a civil war.
*  So how did we get to this nightmarish place?
*  And how do these two generals fit into that story?
*  Well, Michael, to understand that story and how these generals fit into it, you've got
*  to go back to 2019.
*  That was when tens of thousands of Sudanese massed at the gates of the country's military
*  headquarters.
*  And eventually forced the outster of the country's ruler of 30 years Omar Hassan al-Bashir.
*  Women started to have more rights because the hated morality police was disbanded.
*  Artists were making revolutionary art.
*  There was a whole new political movement that sprang up.
*  You know, it was this euphoric moment where millions of Sudanese thought that after decades
*  of isolation, they were going to turn a corner.
*  And the extraordinary thing is that these two generals, General Bahrhan and General Hamdhan,
*  also known as Hemati, up to this point, they're among President Bashir's closest henchmen.
*  And then at the moment of the revolution, they turn on him.
*  They help to kick him out from office.
*  And then as the country moves through this period of dramatic change, they're at the heart
*  of it.
*  They say that they want to be part of a new Sudan.
*  And they say that they're going to help to shepherd the country towards free and fair
*  elections.
*  And what exactly is the role of these two generals in this transition from autocracy to what is
*  supposed to become a democracy?
*  Well, they're both members of something called the sovereignty council, which is this
*  body with civilian and military leaders that was supposed to be overseeing the country during
*  the transition to democracy.
*  For Hamd was the senior guy.
*  He's the head of the military, which is this institution that has dominated Sudan.
*  Personally, he's this decorated elite general.
*  He's often seen pictured with a row of medals and a stiff bearing.
*  And then you've got Hemati, who's this kind of like upstart figure.
*  He established himself by running a militia, which was known for its scorched earth tactics
*  during the genocide in Darfur in the 2000s.
*  That militia eventually morphed into the rapid support forces or Oracev for short, which
*  is the paramilitary group he heads now.
*  And through the Oracev, he has really risen through the ranks of power in Sudan, amassing
*  huge amounts of both wealth and influence.
*  So on this council, General Barhan, in his position as head of the military, acts as the
*  chairman and effectively the head of state during this transitional period.
*  And Hemati, who is also a member of the sovereignty council, is considered to be the second
*  most powerful person in Sudan.
*  So somewhat improbably, both of these generals, despite being originally associated with this
*  autocrat, who so many people in Sudan rebelled against, it is these two generals who end
*  up being entrusted with a transition to democracy.
*  So how does that go?
*  Well, for a little while, it seems to be going pretty well.
*  You've got consultants flying in.
*  You've got a lot of people who are saying they want to help this transition go along.
*  And the revolution in Sudan brings in a lot of Western and regional countries who say
*  that they also want it to succeed.
*  So they send billions of dollars in aid.
*  There's like up to 50 billion dollars in debt relief that is promised to Sudan.
*  And why was that?
*  And why was this transition so important to these outside countries, especially in the
*  West?
*  Well for several reasons, Sudan is the third largest country in Africa.
*  It had been isolated for decades under the former dictator Al-Bashir, and particularly
*  by the United States, which had placed the country under sanctions.
*  So I think that for the US, they wanted to turn a page, a new chapter with Sudan.
*  But more broadly, this is this huge country.
*  It was very strategically located on the Red Sea.
*  And frankly, for Western countries, at this point, they're seeing other strategic competitors
*  in Africa.
*  The Chinese are moving across the continent.
*  The Russians are starting to establish themselves.
*  And I think a lot of countries wanted to make sure that in this very fragile moment of transition
*  for Sudan, that they were the ones who were going to be influencing how it would end.
*  Right.
*  We've talked a lot about this on the show, especially when it comes to an adversary like
*  China, the US wants to make sure that its influence is greatest on some of these African
*  countries.
*  That's right.
*  And what the US is selling in Africa often is democracy.
*  Hmm.
*  Okay.
*  So what happens next in this journey of these two generals towards what is supposed to
*  be a democracy?
*  First of all, we've got to realize that it's not easy.
*  Sudan after 30 years under Bashir is basically a broken country.
*  And it's got this very sort of underdeveloped, fractious political system.
*  So the civilians in the military really struggle to run the country together.
*  The civilians are demanding accountability for prior abuses under the military, including
*  a massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators which had taken place just after the revolution
*  and was blamed on both general hematee and general barhan.
*  And that starts to ratchet up the tension between these two sides.
*  Those tensions build and build.
*  And after about two years in October 2021, these two generals, general barhan and hematee,
*  come together secretly and they man to coup and seize power for themselves, pushing
*  aside the country's civilian prime minister.
*  They put him under house arrest and eventually actually he ends up leaving the country.
*  So these generals are completely reneging on their pledge to bring Sudan into democracy.
*  In fact, they are blocking that journey to democracy.
*  So what happens next?
*  Well, straight away, protesters flood back on the streets, determined that the dream
*  of democracy that seemed to be so close they're not going to let go of it.
*  The economy starts tanking because the West pulls the dollars that had promised as punishment
*  for the coup.
*  And then slowly, slowly behind closed doors, cracks start to form between these two generals
*  themselves and eventually they turn on each other.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Teclan, why did these two generals end up turning on each other?
*  What is that story?
*  Part of it is just a simple power struggle.
*  You know, it's a classic issue.
*  Two bosses is always a bad idea in any organization.
*  And it had come to the point in Sudan where even though barhan was still technically the head
*  of state, clearly hematee was positioning himself to one day rule the country.
*  He starts moving around the country, trying to behave a bit like a politician.
*  He's meeting with tribal leaders.
*  He's dishing out large s, things like toy or land cruisers as a way of buying their
*  favor, showing them that he's serious.
*  And that starts to create a friction between him and his technical boss, Jamal Barhan.
*  He sees himself really as the bearer of the values of this very powerful institution
*  and starts to see hematee and his politicking and his paramilitaries is a threat to his
*  own power.
*  And it's something that the rank and file of the military don't respect.
*  They chase against it.
*  They think that these guys are a bunch of upstarts who need to be put back in their place.
*  So this junior upstart hematee, despite running a much smaller force in the military, is
*  clearly starting to challenge his superior, nipping at his heels in a way that I'm sure
*  if you are barhan is becoming very agonizing.
*  That's right.
*  It's becoming clear that this arrangement of two people running the country is starting
*  to become untenable.
*  And at the same time, the situation of the country itself is getting worse and worse.
*  It's becoming harder and harder to run at.
*  There's violence erupting in far-flung parts of the country.
*  These street protests just go on and on every week.
*  They're out clashing with the police.
*  And so things kind of stumble along until last December when hematee and barhan came together
*  again and more or less agreed to throw in the towel on their own coup under a process
*  that had been negotiated by whole host of countries, including the US and Britain.
*  They signed this deal where they say on April 11th, the fourth anniversary of the outstor
*  of Bashir, we will haunt power back to a civilian government.
*  Wow.
*  So suddenly a transition to democracy is now back on track.
*  At least that's how it looks.
*  But there's one outstanding issue, which is this, how under a new transition administration
*  are these two generals going to bring together their two forces and unite them into one
*  army?
*  Because everybody realizes for Sudan to have any sort of stable future, it's just not realistic
*  or tenable for it to have two rival armies.
*  So they need to resolve that question and it becomes incredibly difficult because hematee
*  understands that if his group, the rapid support forces, is effectively subsumed into the
*  main army, he's nobody.
*  So he says it's going to take us ten years to bring our armies together.
*  Barhan and the military say, you know what?
*  I think we need to do it in two years.
*  And this becomes this huge divide between the two of them.
*  How are they going to resolve that question?
*  And at the same time, their aids start to trash each other in public.
*  They're throwing each aid themselves.
*  Twice, hematee is locked out of meetings that ostensibly he should have been at in the
*  presidential palace by Barhan's guards.
*  And on the streets of Cartoum at night, residents start to notice that convoys of soldiers
*  are filtering into the city from both of these groups.
*  Troops and armored vehicles are rolling in and they're taking a position at these military
*  camps that are dotted around Cartoum.
*  And these camps are marking each other.
*  They're like soccer players on a field.
*  It seems where there's a North SF camp, then there's going to be a military camp close
*  by.
*  And it quickly becomes clear that as this political negotiation is going on, both of these guys
*  are bolstering their military forces.
*  For what everyone hopes at least is just a way of increasing their leverage, but of course,
*  it's a little bit like in a movie, if you introduce a loaded gun in an airy scene of the
*  movie, there's always a danger it's going to go off later.
*  And ultimately, that's what happens in Sudan.
*  So ultimately, what gets us to this point is this existential question of whether one
*  of these men is going to lose a tremendous amount of face and power by losing their status
*  as a military leader.
*  And in the face of that prospect, these two men start to plan for what sounds like war.
*  Absolutely.
*  You're absolutely right.
*  You know, I was there just a month ago and I saw for myself just how bad things have
*  become between these two leaders.
*  Everyone I met in the cafes, speaking to politicians, the main topic of conversation
*  was the crashing relationship between these two generals and how it was going to be resolved.
*  And then a couple of weeks later, the fighting started.
*  Right.
*  Which I think brings us to that text you got from your friend saying war has begun and
*  to this moment where in now, these absolutely terrible scenes of violence that you described
*  in the Capitol, where exactly does that fighting stand at this moment?
*  It's concentrated in the center of the Capitol.
*  That's where both of these sides are juking it out.
*  The military is pressing its main advantage, which is that it has an air force and
*  hemmedy does not.
*  Our reporting indicates that the military's focus at this point is effectively to take
*  out hemmity.
*  They are trying to track him, his phone calls, any other information they have.
*  And when they find a location where they think he is, they are pummeling that location with
*  bombs from war planes.
*  So their calculation, it seems, is that if they can cut the head off the snake of the
*  RSS, that it will fall apart.
*  And then we've got the paramilitaries on the other side who have weaved themselves into
*  the fabric of the city, taking cover in buildings, carrying out their own assaults on the military.
*  And they've also made it clear that they see this as a fight to the death.
*  So there is destruction everywhere.
*  And in fact, over a number of days we've seen general hematee being the first person
*  to propose a ceasefire in the evenings in order he says to allow for people to leave their
*  houses and get food or water or for people to flee the city to safety.
*  But it seems that he might want to have in fact a pause for his forces to regroup under
*  this absolutely terrifying onslaught that they're suffering in the battle for cartoon.
*  So as you might expect, the general who runs the large army is doing better.
*  And as these soldiers from these two units are waging this battle on behalf of their leaders,
*  where from your reporting are the loyalties of the people of Sudan, these civilians who
*  it sounds like are caught in the middle of it.
*  Are they picking sides or are they just trying to get out of the way?
*  You know, that's the crazy thing.
*  Everybody I speak to says this is not our fight.
*  I think everybody recognizes that there's been bad behavior on both sides and everybody
*  blames these two leaders for allowing this difference between them to escalate to the
*  point where it is propelling the country into an all-out war.
*  So I don't think either side have a great deal of popularity.
*  But for most people right now, this is just about survival.
*  And in the last couple of days, people have been strategizing about how they can get
*  out of the city.
*  And that's possibly going to be the next stage of this crisis.
*  Potentially hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of people displaced from their homes
*  in the middle of Sudan and pushed to other parts of the country so that they can leave
*  these two guys, these two generals to juke it out between themselves and see who's going
*  to win.
*  Well, at some point, one of these two branches of the military will presumably defeat
*  the other.
*  And regardless of whichever general prevails, I think we can assume that neither will
*  readily give up power and put it into the hands of the people of Sudan and embrace democracy.
*  So is the idea of democracy at this point in Sudan and the hope for it doomed?
*  It's in tatters right now.
*  The best laid plans of the international community, which has spent months trying to cajole these
*  two generals to hand over power, that plan now appears to be effectively dead.
*  Right now, people are trying to save their lives.
*  And they're trying to stop the fighting before it completely destroys the capital and the
*  rest of the country.
*  What might follow afterwards is really hard to say at the stage.
*  There are many different scenarios, almost none of them very appealing for Sudan about
*  what might follow after this.
*  But it probably just depends on the end of the day how quickly this will be over and how
*  clean the victory of one side over the other might be.
*  But we don't know that yet.
*  It's just too chaotic to know.
*  Jacqueline, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  On Sunday, the United States, Britain, France, and China began to evacuate diplomats and
*  their families from Sudan at a fear that the fighting there could endanger their lives.
*  The evacuations occurred during what both sides described as a 72-hour ceasefire to mark
*  the end of the holy month of Ramadan.
*  Despite those pledges, deadly clashes continued throughout the weekend.
*  So far, the fighting has killed at least 400 people and injured about 3500.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need, chinata-day.
*  In a highly anticipated decision on Friday, the Supreme Court ruled that the abortion drug
*  Mifapristone will remain widely available in a decision that rejects two lower court
*  rulings that sought to restrict its access.
*  The decision only impacts the drug's availability in the short term, as the Supreme Court considers
*  a bigger legal challenge to its legality from a federal judge in Texas who has ordered
*  that it be banned.
*  But the ruling suggests there is little appetite among the justices to endorse that approach.
*  The two of the courts' nine justices disagreed with the decision, Samuel Alito and Clarence
*  Thomas.
