*  I'm announcing today that I'm running for President of the United States of America.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Borrow.
*  This is the Daily.
*  Today.
*  For a strong American.
*  For a proud American.
*  Before God and my family.
*  I am running for United States President of the United States of America.
*  Day after day, more and more long-shot Republicans are throwing their hat into the 2024 presidential
*  race despite a set of seemingly insurmountable obstacles in their way.
*  My colleague Shane Goldmacher offers us a guide to the new crop of candidates and their
*  rationale for running.
*  It's Thursday, June 5.
*  Shane, hello.
*  Hello, Michael.
*  Good to see you.
*  Nice to see you as well.
*  Shane, your bylines and your daylines in the times tell us that you have been in Iowa.
*  The reason we want to talk you is because this Republican race is now truly it feels
*  underway and because several new candidates have entered the race in just the past few
*  days.
*  That's a little bit confounding in a way because of what we already know about this Republican
*  field, which is first that Donald Trump has a lock on something like a third of the Republican
*  electorate and that lock can't be broken.
*  Second, that Ron DeSantis has emerged as the very clear number two in the Republican
*  field trying to somehow pick off some of those Trump voters and consolidate the remainder
*  of the Republican field.
*  With that in mind, we want to talk about the rationale of these candidates that keep
*  entering this race day after day, candidates who with apologies to them are kind of lower
*  tier candidates than Trump and DeSantis.
*  And why do you think they think they have a real shot?
*  Well, I think there's two reasons.
*  And one is a general reason, which is there's a long history of early front runners stumbling
*  in presidential politics, right?
*  The people who look like 800 pound gorillas at the beginning of the year, they end up not
*  actually winning.
*  And sometimes they're not even the top two or three candidates by the time that voters
*  are actually casting their ballots.
*  So you're saying a big rationale for these candidates is that perhaps DeSantis and maybe
*  in some world, even Trump would somehow falter or collapse or be indicted or go to jail,
*  leaving space for someone else to rise up.
*  Yeah, I think the first is that long history that the people at the front at the beginning
*  so often aren't the people at the front at the end.
*  But if that's the sort of broader general reason, there's a more specific reason, which
*  is in the last six months leading into his candidacy, Ron DeSantis didn't appear as a world
*  beater to all his potential opponents.
*  He didn't consolidate the base to turn this race into a clear two person contest.
*  He had some stumbles when he first started to do his book tour.
*  He had some donors who said, oh, I'm not sure that he's actually going to be the more
*  electable republic and he's taken positions on issues that make him a tougher candidate
*  in the general election.
*  Depending on the people's views, there was weakness seen in the pre-candidacy of Ron
*  DeSantis that encouraged people who A, who are already in the race or B, who are about
*  to get in or getting into the race, that there was in fact an opportunity to emerge as
*  the non-Trump candidate.
*  Because there's not as many questions about that Trump base.
*  There are legal questions about potential indictments and his ability to continue to
*  run, but both sides between Trump's legal jeopardy and Ron DeSantis's performance on the
*  stump opened up the Pandora's Box for all of these potential candidates to say, you know
*  what?
*  I'm going to throw my hat in the ring because there's a chance that I might be able to
*  break through.
*  Okay.
*  So who is in this as you have termed it Pandora's Box of Republican candidates who may not
*  look all that meaningful right now in the polls, but who could become much bigger players
*  in this Republican nomination contest?
*  Well, right now there's going to be about 10 or 11 candidates by the end of this week.
*  They include people like Asa Hutchinson, who's a former governor of Arkansas, Larry
*  Elder, longtime radio talk show host in California.
*  They're people like Doug Burgham, who's entering the race this week as the governor of
*  North Dakota, even Perry Johnson, the candidate who tried to run for governor of Michigan
*  and failed and is deciding to parlay that into an even longer shot presidential bid.
*  But really there's five candidates that are worth focusing more time on besides Donald
*  Trump and besides Ron DeSantis.
*  And that's Chris Christie.
*  It's Mike Pence.
*  It's Tim Scott.
*  It's Nikki Haley from Svayk, Rameswamy.
*  Okay.
*  So what's the right framework, Shane, for thinking about and kind of classifying in our
*  heads, those five Republican candidates for president?
*  Like most things in the Republican Party for the last eight years, the best framework
*  to think about this race is how all the other candidates are relating to Donald Trump,
*  whether they're mimicking Trump, whether they're trying to out Trump Trump or in the case
*  of Chris Christie, where they're running to say, it's time for the party to move on.
*  And I'm the candidate who's going to take him on and knock him down a notch.
*  Well, let's start with Christie, former US attorney, former governor of New Jersey,
*  and a former advisor to Trump during Trump's presence.
*  Guys, thank you.
*  Thank you guys for being here.
*  Thank you.
*  Yeah, I mean, and you just got at one of the sort of key facts and contradictions of
*  the Chris Christie candidacy, which is way back in 2016.
*  He was a key and door served on Trump.
*  He helped run his presidential transition.
*  And now, let me be very clear, I am going out there to take out Donald Trump, but here's
*  why I want to win.
*  And I don't want him to win.
*  Chris Christie's pitching himself as the answer to bringing the Republican Party around
*  to a non-Trump era.
*  A lonely, self-consumed, self-serving mirror hog is not a leader.
*  After the 2020 election, when Donald Trump wouldn't accept the election results, and then
*  especially after January 6th, Chris Christie said, look, Donald Trump is a danger to the
*  Republican Party, and he's bad for the country.
*  And sat and watched on TV as people that he urged to go to the Capitol, smash the windows,
*  broke into the Capitol, and chanted, hang my pants, hang his own vice president.
*  And when he heard that and saw that, you know what he did?
*  He ate his well-done cheeseburger and sat there and did nothing, and let people die in
*  that building.
*  Is that really the kind of character we want back in the old office?
*  And now he's saying the person to take on Trump, the person to take down Trump is me, a
*  former Trump insider who knows him, knows his weaknesses, and can expose them on the national
*  stage.
*  Hmm.
*  So it's basically a pitch to Republican voters to excise Trump from the Republican Party.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  But we know from everything that has occurred over the last eight years in American politics,
*  that excising Trump from the Republican Party is a little bit like excising the blue from
*  the sky, right?
*  It seems like a very big stretch.
*  And undoubtedly that's something Chris Christie knows.
*  Look, if you look at polling, Chris Christie starts this race in probably the worst position
*  of the best known candidates out there.
*  There was a CNN poll recently where 60% of Republicans said they would not consider supporting
*  Chris Christie under any circumstances.
*  So how do you win a Republican primary where 60% of the voters at the beginning say, no
*  way, no how, no Chris Christie.
*  And so he says, look, he's not running unless he thinks there's a path to win.
*  But for most people, he's seen as a candidate who can literally confront Trump and specifically
*  on a debate stage.
*  He's like, he even had this moment in New Hampshire, the same place he announced his campaign
*  this week.
*  He had a town hall or the sheer where he said, basically, you want me on that debate stage.
*  We say so.
*  You better have somebody on that stage who can do to him what I did tomorrow.
*  It was this sort of a few get men moment where he's saying, look, the last time you heard
*  of me was 2015, 2016 on the presidential campaign trail, when I was eviscerating Marco Rubio,
*  catching him and repeating his talking points in real time.
*  Because that's the only thing that's going to defeat Trump.
*  And that means you got to still do it.
*  That means you have to be furious.
*  You need somebody like that, somebody a brawler like me who can take on Trump on the
*  debate stage.
*  That makes me wonder, Shane, if it would be enough for Christy to just land one big punch
*  against Trump on a debate stage and then he could just kind of fade away.
*  Well, there's two big problems with that.
*  The first is that Christy has to get onto that debate stage and just announcing your campaign
*  doesn't do it.
*  The Republican National Committee recently set criteria to make those first debates and
*  it's 40,000 donors and it's achieving 1% of the polls.
*  And while he's so far has been in that 1% range, which is pretty low, 40,000 individual
*  donors is a high bar for a candidate like Chris Christie who is out of line with the
*  new Republican base and finding all those people is going to be challenged.
*  So that's challenge one from in challenge two is does Trump even show up?
*  Donald Trump has talked about not attending each of the first two debates and he may
*  outend only one of them.
*  And so even if Chris Christie gets that moment on the debate stage, Trump might not be there
*  to receive the punch.
*  Okay, so a long shot candidacy.
*  Who is next?
*  The Land of Opportunity, beacon of democracy, the shining city on the hill.
*  I would say Vice President Mike Pence is the next candidate and just announced.
*  Just announced and he starts in this unusual place because he was Donald Trump's
*  loyal lieutenant for four years.
*  I had the great honor to serve in Congress as governor and as your Vice President.
*  And I'll always be proud of the progress we made together for a stronger, more prosperous
*  America.
*  So for most voters, he was the guy standing beside and never disagreeing with Donald
*  Trump.
*  That is of course until January 6th, where he didn't vote to overturn the 2020 elections
*  and that was really the break in the Trump Pence relationship.
*  And how Pence is positioning himself in the 2024 race is not a sort of Trumpism light.
*  It's actually a throwback to Reaganism.
*  We can turn this country around, but different times call for different leadership.
*  Today our party and our country need a leader that will appeal, as Lincoln said, to the better
*  angels of our nature.
*  He's saying the Republican party needs to turn back the clock and refine its roots.
*  When he talks about the old three-legged stool that Reagan talked about for the Republican
*  party of the 1980s, which is fiscal conservatism, really actually spending less money, which
*  is not what happened in the Trump administration.
*  We can bring this country back.
*  We can defend our nation and secure our border.
*  We can revive our economy and put our nation back on a path to a balanced budget.
*  Being hawks on national security, which right now is about robustly supporting Ukraine
*  and probably most important at the beginning stages of the Pence candidacy is social conservatism
*  and appealing to the evangelical Christian right, where he is promising to go further on
*  some social issues in other Republicans, especially on abortion, as the most outspoken Republican
*  talking up a national abortion ban.
*  I believe in the American people.
*  And I have faith.
*  God is not done with America yet.
*  And together we can bring this country back and the best days for the greatest nation
*  on earth are yet to come.
*  God bless you and God bless the United States of America.
*  But Shane Trump has a pretty tight relationship with religious voters, with evangelical voters.
*  We know that because they helped elect him in the first place and because his Supreme
*  Court picks overturned Roe versus Wade.
*  So there's not a lot of daylight between Trump and what would seem like the key block of
*  voters who Pence thinks he can win over in this campaign.
*  That's true.
*  But the alliance between evangelical voters and Donald Trump was always an uneasy one.
*  Just because of who Donald Trump is, because of the record around his own moral character.
*  And so while evangelical voters got so much of what they wanted, including multiple appointments
*  at the Supreme Court, including the overturning of Roe v Wade, a generational goal, there's
*  now this belief, at least from the Mike Pence world and even some other candidates that,
*  look, you can have all of those things without the personality issues of Donald Trump.
*  And that's part of their pitch.
*  You know, Pence knows that he's a long shot.
*  And they've said that they're going to run very heavily in Iowa specifically.
*  Even some people around him have talked about, it's like running for county sheriff in
*  all 99 counties.
*  He's basically going to live there.
*  That's not the typical path for a former vice president, but that's the path that Mike
*  Pence is taking at the moment.
*  Right.
*  So Pence's best hope is that based on his appeal to religious conservatives based on policy
*  and based on moral character, he could end up shocking everyone with a superb performance
*  in Iowa, that first Republican election of this whole process and get a huge bump and suddenly
*  become a meaningful player in this race.
*  And then perhaps something happens like Ron DeSantis, falters, and suddenly Pence is not
*  just an asterisk anymore.
*  He's a real force.
*  And my time in Iowa this week really showed a little bit of just how long the shot that
*  is for Mike Pence.
*  I talked to a lot of Republican voters and very, very few people brought up Mike Pence's
*  name and even someone they're considering at this point.
*  And I think one of the reasons is he's both so closely associated with Donald Trump
*  and trying to break away from him at the same time.
*  So in the months leading up to his announcement this week, Mike Pence is sort of flirted
*  with a break from Trump.
*  He said the party needs to resist the siren song of populism, which is of course what the
*  Trump presidency represented.
*  But then in his announcement, he did something different.
*  It might be fair to ask why I'm challenging my former running mate.
*  He actually broke with Trump.
*  January 6 was a tragic day in the life of our nation.
*  The American people were in the same place.
*  And he did it over January 6.
*  On that day President Trump also demanded that I choose between him and the Constitution.
*  And he said, I chose the Constitution and I always will.
*  But anybody who's asked to make that choice between the Constitution and himself that
*  a person picking themself should never be president.
*  And it's a line he'd never crossed before when talking about Donald Trump.
*  Add all that up and it shows why Mike Pence is in such a tough spot in this race.
*  How are you for four years, the most loyal of lieutenants, and then asking voters to say,
*  you know what, we want you instead.
*  So as with Christie Pence's path is narrow, tricky, relies on some things that very well
*  might not happen.
*  And these two are charting what feels like the most oppositional quote-unquote relationship
*  to Trump, although it varies between them.
*  And I wonder where that leaves the rest of the field and their relationship to Trump.
*  I think it leaves three other candidates, Tim Scott, Nikki Haley, and Vivek Ramaswami,
*  trying to find their moment without directly confronting Donald Trump.
*  So Shane, let's delve into this world of second-tier candidates who are unwilling to
*  forcefully confront Trump in any way and how they are seeing their path in this race.
*  Well, the first person that comes to mind is Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, who's
*  really running a different stylist to campaign than most of the rest of the field.
*  It's very sort of happy warrior, optimistic, tells the life story of himself as the lone
*  black Republican in the United States Senate and saying that anything is possible in America.
*  Good evening.
*  I'm Senator Tim Scott from the great state of South Carolina.
*  His first moment on the national scene was giving the state of the Union response to
*  Biden's first national address from Congress.
*  We need policies and progress that brings us closer together.
*  But three months in, the actions of the president and his party are pulling us further and further
*  apart.
*  And it was really well received.
*  He had a flood of small online donations.
*  And the question is, does the tone that he's talking in, does that match the sort of mood
*  of a Republican party that in recent years has wanted a fighter, a brawler, somebody willing
*  to just annihilate the left and the Democratic Party?
*  The easiest and cheapest game in politics is the game of division and fear.
*  The only problem is that leaves our country broken, starved and depraved.
*  We deserve better as a nation.
*  At the core of the early Tim Scott candidacy is this sense that if Ron DeSantis and Donald
*  Trump spent the next six months hitting each other, that there's going to be an appetite
*  among Republican voters for something else.
*  But when the rubber meets the road, how does this happy warrior, optimistic campaign actually
*  win over Republican voters, especially when, from what you're saying, it doesn't ever
*  explicitly go after the two leading candidates.
*  Well, he starts with a geographic and a demographic plan.
*  And the geographic plan is, he's the senator from one of the three early states, South
*  Carolina.
*  So he has a base in one of those early states that he hopes can last.
*  And in order to maximize his chances in South Carolina, he's focusing on Iowa and he's
*  focusing on those same evangelical voters that Mike Pence is speaking to.
*  We are a faith-filled country, but our foundation as a nation is a Judeo-Christian foundation.
*  And the further we get away from it, the harder life gets.
*  And Tim Scott speaks with an evangelical fluency that really is almost unmatched in their
*  Republican field.
*  I heard the Lord speak to my heart and say, this is not about you.
*  He is speaking in a way that people immediately understand that he too is a religious man.
*  It was a combination between John 1427 and first beat of 5-7 that you cast all year.
*  And that's a very, very important voting block in Iowa.
*  And the other thing that Tim Scott has is that he's a black Republican.
*  And if you look back in the last two Republican presidential primaries, there has been a moment
*  where black Republicans have popped up and jumped in the polls.
*  Herman Cain did in 2012 and he was not really running what most people consider to serious
*  campaign at that time.
*  And yet at one point, he taught Mitt Romney in the 2012 Republican primary polls.
*  Right.
*  In 2016, the one candidate in the 2015 calendar year who jumped ahead of Donald Trump, it
*  wasn't Jeff Bush, it wasn't Ted Cruz.
*  It was Ben Carson, right?
*  So Tim Scott and his aides think that he's well positioned to eventually have a similar
*  bump later this year.
*  Shane, how should we understand those bumps from Herman Cain and Ben Carson and the idea
*  that they are tied to the candidates race?
*  And how should we understand the idea that that might also happen to Senator Scott?
*  I think you have to think about it that the base of the Republican Party is overwhelmingly
*  white.
*  And that base has heard for years and years accusations that they're racist.
*  That they are discriminatory.
*  And so the idea of in a poll or at the voting booth or online by giving their credit card
*  number can elevate a black Republican is deeply appealing to those voters.
*  We have too many false prophets talking about how we are condemned eternally for the
*  original sin.
*  I believe that our nation is a story of redemption.
*  And he's saying that to the Republican base to say, you elevate me and you are telling
*  the left and the Democratic Party that the Republican Party is non-racist.
*  So Scott is doing something pretty interesting and unique in this race.
*  His candidacy is it feels like the candidacy least about Donald Trump so far.
*  It's about Scott, his temperament, his sunny optimism, and his unique appeal as a black
*  Republican fluent in the language of social conservatism from a state that happens to
*  be an early voting Republican state.
*  So he thinks that's a potentially potent combination.
*  Yeah.
*  He's not the only candidate who's avoided direct disagreements with Donald Trump.
*  In fact, another candidate from South Carolina who's taken a similar pact is Nikki Haley.
*  I have always had a deep belief in America.
*  We're ready.
*  Ready to move past the stale ideas and faded names of the past.
*  She's the former governor of South Carolina, the former United Nations ambassador under Trump.
*  And at times she's avoided any real policy disagreements with Trump just like Scott.
*  And there's similar another way.
*  They're both from South Carolina and she as an Indian American woman is a non-white candidate
*  in a white dominated party.
*  Okay, well, what is the case that Haley is making for the nomination if she's not explicitly
*  criticizing Trump in any way?
*  She has some criticisms of Trump, but they're implicit.
*  It's time for a new generational leader that can put the status quo behind us, that can
*  put all of the past issues behind us and say now it's time for us to move forward as a
*  country.
*  There are things like saying it's time to turn the page on a new generation of leaders,
*  right?
*  She's focused on age in generation as a differentiator.
*  She's called for mental competency tests for everyone above age 75, which happens to
*  hit both Trump, 76, and Joe Biden, where she's been less subtle is whacking on DeSantis,
*  especially over his fight with Disney.
*  When you have a company like that, don't bring the citizens taxpayer dollars into it,
*  pick up the phone, deal with it, settle it the way you should.
*  And I think he's being hypocritical.
*  He's criticized and said from one governor to another, I know how to treat businesses
*  and her business climate, history as governor is a big part of her pitch.
*  She's trying to find her place in this race by displacing Ron DeSantis first before taking
*  on Donald Trump.
*  Right.
*  So this is a strategy of not going after Trump, really, but really going after DeSantis so
*  that she can be seen as a rival to DeSantis and kind of waiting in the wings if, as many
*  hope in this field, DeSantis does eventually falter.
*  Yeah.
*  And I would say that if Tim Scott was presenting himself as the candidate of hope, she does
*  want to present herself as tough and as a fighter.
*  And look, there's a long history that women candidates have a high bar to clear with voters
*  on those issues, that there's a natural misogyny to the electorate, both Democrats and Republicans.
*  And her identity is a complicated part of her candidacy because she doesn't lean into
*  it in some ways, but in others, she very much does.
*  I think that the one thing we need to do to make sure we write this ship is Santa bad
*  ask Republican woman to the White House.
*  When she's asked like, who should be the best candidate?
*  She'll say something like, let the best woman win, right?
*  And she's the prominent woman running in the race.
*  And so a big part of her candidacy is pitching herself as tough enough for the job, saying
*  she took on all these other countries when she was at the UN.
*  She took on all these other people when she was governor and that she can take on first
*  Rhonda Santis and then Donald Trump.
*  Shannon, I believe that brings us to our fifth second tier candidate in the Republican field,
*  the Vake Ralaswamy.
*  Yeah, he's somebody who six months ago would not have been someone you'd included in the
*  second tier.
*  It's a self funding so far, extremely self confident, 37 year old former entrepreneur.
*  I traveled the country calling out the woke industrial complex in America.
*  I started a new company called strive to take on BlackRock and the ESG movement through
*  the market itself, who seated his campaign with $10 million and has taken this sort of
*  go everywhere all at once approach.
*  And Donald Trump, a man who I took inspiration from.
*  Instead of saying I'm the anti Trump, instead of saying I'm not going to criticize Trump,
*  he said, I love Trump.
*  I know him.
*  He cares deeply about national unity.
*  I know you care deeply about national unity.
*  I'm running for president because I care deeply about national unity.
*  He just wasn't Trump enough.
*  He could have done even more.
*  He hadn't done what he did in 2015 and 2016 as an outsider to came and shake up the system.
*  I wouldn't have even thought about doing what I'm doing today and running for president.
*  That's just a fact.
*  And what exactly does that look like to out Trump, Trump?
*  Well, if you go to his website, he doesn't have an issues page that you would think of.
*  In a normal sense, it's called America first 2.0.
*  So I'm an unapologetic America first conservative.
*  I do not apologize about that, but I think to put America first, we need to go further
*  and rediscover what America includes like using the military to squash the Mexican drug cartels.
*  I think it is a legitimate, morally, ethically, legally justified use of military force.
*  It includes things like rolling back affirmative action in a single executive order.
*  It is a cancer on our national soul.
*  He talks about banning federal unionized employees, ending the civil service protection
*  for bureaucrats.
*  He wants to make it so there are term limits for people who work for the federal government,
*  not for lawmakers, but for the civil service so that people aren't making a career out
*  of the government.
*  I'm pretty animated about this because it is my top domestic priority to actually decimate
*  the administrative state and restore a three branch government, not a four or five branch
*  government as we have today.
*  He's talking about a wholesale re-imagination of the role and power to the federal government
*  with much of it centralized in his hands in a powerful executive.
*  And which voters exactly is this meant to appeal to?
*  If as we've said a million times on the show, Trump has something like a third of the Republican
*  electorate locked up.
*  And the rest of the GOP is wary of Trump.
*  What does that leave for Ramoswamy?
*  I think it comes down to how you define wary.
*  If you've got a chunk of 20%, there really doesn't want Trump.
*  They're ready for the party to move on.
*  There's about 50% of the Republican party.
*  And the bet that Ramoswamy is making, and frankly, it's really similar to the bet that
*  Ronda Santas is making, is that that part of the party, they're not wary of Trump because
*  they want to change the things he stands for the way that like Pence for instance is
*  arguing about.
*  It's that that 50% wants an even Trumpier candidate.
*  And he presents this in a very brash package.
*  He speaks with the same kind of fluency that some other candidates are speaking to evangelicals.
*  He's speaking to the Trump base.
*  He speaks the same language as them.
*  And his bet is that there's more votes there than on the anti-Trump end of the spectrum.
*  So his theory is that plenty Republicans want more Trump, but without Trump, they want
*  the policies without the drama and the personality flaws.
*  And with a different package, with a Ramoswamy package, a big number of non-Trump people
*  will get behind Ramoswamy.
*  Yes.
*  And we talked about that debate threshold.
*  Ramoswamy said he already has 40,000 donors, right?
*  That's going to be a challenge for the former vice president.
*  But this guy, he already has that.
*  So he is found a following online.
*  And when you talk to voters in Iowa, they've seen him.
*  And some of these events I meet people who have already seen him twice, right?
*  He is doing lots of events.
*  He has a bus tour.
*  He has his own money that he's putting into the campaign.
*  And so he's out there on the trail.
*  He's not looking at candidate with a pathway to win.
*  But he is looking like a candidate with a pathway to impact the results in the Iowa caucuses
*  and beyond.
*  Right.
*  And then maybe one again in four years or eight years or 12 years or 16 years, right?
*  He would still be young.
*  Exactly.
*  By the comparison of some of the other candidates.
*  So Shane, assuming way out, what does this group of candidates tell us about the fundamental
*  nature of this emerging Republican campaign?
*  We're going to spend lots of time talking about Trump and lots of time talking about
*  the Sanders.
*  But what does this group of five candidates we've spent this time talking about reveal?
*  I think I would answer that by telling you how Donald Trump is reacted to this field
*  expanding.
*  He seems pretty pleased.
*  You would think that seeing his former United Nations ambassador running for president would
*  bother Donald Trump, right?
*  That he wouldn't want Nikki Haley to be running for president.
*  But that's not actually how he responded when she got into the race.
*  They had a private phone call and he wasn't discouraging of her running.
*  He didn't attack her for being disloyal when Tim Scott got into the race.
*  Similarly, he issued a positive statement.
*  He's only said nice things about Rama Swami.
*  Because the Trump team has been pretty clear, the only person they see as seriously contesting
*  the nomination from him is Ron DeSantis.
*  So all these other people for Trump who sees himself and his advisors who see him holding
*  a big base in the Republican party, the more people in this race, they see dividing up
*  the rest of that 70%.
*  However, you split it up, whatever chunks you think they're taking, he sees them taking
*  chunks that Ron DeSantis needs in order to be Trump.
*  Right, this is a dream scenario for Trump because every day a new Republican candidate
*  enters the race, it's easier and easier for him to win the nomination because each of
*  them takes a small slice of the Republican electorate and makes it impossible for anyone
*  to truly compete with them.
*  This is the fear that Republican strategists have who don't want Trump to continue to be
*  the leader of the Republican party, which is that all these candidates stick around and
*  that they're there on the day of the Iowa caucuses and they're taking 5% of the vote,
*  6% of the vote, 10% of the vote, and making the math that much harder for Ron DeSantis
*  to coalesce the rest of the party behind a single Trump alternative.
*  So, Sean, I just want to end on a thought experiment.
*  If anyone of these candidates we've talked about, somehow ends up breaking through for
*  not just in one primary or one caucus, but in an enduring and sustained way.
*  And the race becomes one of them versus DeSantis versus Trump.
*  What will that mean and what will that tell us about the Republican party?
*  Well, it would first be an indictment of the DeSantis candidacy and him as a candidate
*  because that would result in him having failed to break through.
*  And it would also say that maybe the party doesn't just want what Trump and DeSantis have
*  been offering, which is variations on a theme of Trumpism and that maybe that there's
*  space for something else.
*  But so far, we really haven't seen an appetite for that.
*  Well, Shane, thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Smoke from hundreds of wildfires in Canada has drifted down to the American Northeast and Midwest,
*  creating days of hazy skies and serious air pollution.
*  This air quality event presents real health risks.
*  The fine particulate matter in the air can get into people's lungs, cause inflammation,
*  and worse in conditions like asthma.
*  In New York City, the result has been the worst air quality since the 1960s, according
*  to the city's health commissioner, who during a news conference on Wednesday advised city
*  residents to avoid the smoke.
*  Right now, our health guidance to all New Yorkers is to limit outdoor activity as much as possible.
*  And CNN has fired its president, Chris Lycht, after a 13 month tenure marked by plunging
*  ratings, declining profits, and internal tumult.
*  Lycht had sought to restore CNN's reputation for nonpartisan journalism, but several of
*  his highest profile decisions backfired.
*  Don Lemon, Lycht's hand picked co-host for a new CNN morning show, was forced to resign
*  over on air comments, and a live town hall last month featuring Donald Trump, which
*  Lycht oversaw, was roundly criticized for giving Trump a prime time platform to lying.
*  Today's episode was produced by Michael Simon Johnson, Mary Wilson, Eric Kruppki, Rob
*  Zipko and Sydney Herbert.
*  It was edited by John Ketchum and Paige Cowatt, contains original music by Mary and Lasano,
*  and was engineered by Chris Wood.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Lantfark of Wonderly.
*  That's it for daily.
*  I'm Michael Barber.
*  See you tomorrow.
