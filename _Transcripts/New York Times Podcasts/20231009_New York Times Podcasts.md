# War in Israel
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzI8A875U10)
*  I'm very sorry about what happened first of all.
*  Second of all, can you tell me how it started?
*  Yes, yes.
*  My wife and I and our two daughters live in Kibbutz Nachaloz, which is a beautiful community
*  on the border with Gaza.
*  And we are very proud and still are to be members of this community.
*  Yesterday morning at 6 a.m. we heard a whistle and we realized that bombs are falling.
*  We are very attuned to these kinds of things and actually in every house in our community
*  there is what we call a safe room, which is a room that is built of very strong concrete
*  and has a special kind of door that is supposed to withstand the fall of mortars and rockets
*  and that's usually where the children sleep.
*  So we just ran to the safe room, closed the window, closed the door and we just wait for
*  it to be over.
*  But then we started hearing gunfire.
*  Gunfire very close and it became closer and closer and that's when we realized we're
*  in a different kind of event.
*  And we realized that there are terrorists inside our neighborhood and at some point
*  outside our window.
*  We could hear them talk, we could hear them run, we could hear them shooting their guns
*  at our house, at our windows.
*  There was no military anywhere in sight.
*  And at that moment we realized that we are here alone.
*  We are going to have to stay in there and pray basically.
*  I have to say my daughters were real heroes.
*  Our oldest is three and a half years old and our younger is a year and a half.
*  We told them they have to be quiet.
*  And so for nine hours my girls have not eaten anything.
*  They have not gotten out of the safe room.
*  We have no electricity.
*  We have no phone.
*  We have no light.
*  And around 3.30 I think it was, this is nine and a half hours into the ordeal we heard
*  a big bang on the concrete window.
*  And we heard my father say, Egate, I'm here.
*  We opened the door finally and he came in with this group of soldiers.
*  We hugged them.
*  They hugged us.
*  Then the difficult part began.
*  They started bringing into our house families that could no longer stay in theirs, wounded
*  people, people who don't know where their loved ones are, people who heard terrorists
*  walking inside their house.
*  Something that did not happen to us and I think is way more traumatic.
*  Everybody was gathered in our house and you saw all the pain of the people and the fear
*  of the children.
*  This went on for several hours and in the middle of the night the soldiers organized
*  the bus came and took all of us, including my father, now with us out of the kibbutz.
*  I have to say we are very, very angry and disappointed.
*  We felt alone.
*  We're crying for help and nobody came.
*  And when we were sitting there with the girls and hearing the Hamas cell outside our window,
*  my wife told me, this is the Yom Kippur war of our life.
*  This is the Yom Kippur war of our generation.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi and this is The Daily.
*  Over the weekend, Palestinian militants launched a stunning and highly coordinated invasion
*  rampaging through Israeli towns, killing people in their homes and on the streets and taking hostages.
*  Today, my colleague, Isabel Kirchner, on the biggest attack against Israel in 50 years
*  and the all-out war that it has now prompted.
*  It's Monday, October 9th.
*  So, Isabel, we all woke up Saturday morning to this unbelievable news that there had been
*  this massive attack on Israel.
*  And over the course of the day, I was absolutely glued to my phone and to your dispatches trying
*  to understand what on earth was happening.
*  This is not something we really ever see, an attack on this scale, on Israeli territory.
*  How did the day start for you?
*  Well, I was woken up by a phone call probably about an hour into the beginning of the attack,
*  which began with rocket fire.
*  And honestly, there was such a fog of what exactly was happening at the time.
*  It really took most of the day for details to emerge.
*  But as the hours unfolded, it became clear that this was a hugely coordinated invasion
*  of Israel carried out by militants from the Gaza Strip, which is a Palestinian territory
*  adjacent to Israel.
*  And the militants were from Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls the Gaza Strip.
*  And those militants broke easily through the fortifications on the border, reaching
*  more than 10 miles into Israeli territory, taking over houses, taking over whole villages,
*  coming by air, land and sea.
*  And as the events unfolded and the day went on, it became clear that this was the broadest,
*  invasion of Israeli territory in 50 years.
*  Okay, so let's start to unpack this.
*  When did it begin and how did it begin?
*  So it began at about 630 in the morning.
*  It was a Saturday, the day of the Sabbath here, when most people would have been asleep.
*  It was also a Jewish holiday of Sukkot, Simchat Torah, which is usually a very festive day,
*  which caps the High Holy Days of the autumn season.
*  And people had really been gearing up for a nice weekend and woke up to barrages of
*  rocket fire, sirens going off all over the country.
*  They were going off in Tel Aviv, they were going off in central Jerusalem.
*  As the morning went on, there were scenes emerging on TV and social media of tractors
*  just crashing through the border fence on the Gaza border.
*  We saw columns of vehicles speeding through with nobody there to stop them.
*  They were headed to the communities along the border, villages, kibbutzim and small
*  cooperative villages.
*  Once they reached these communities and towns, they literally went house to house and started
*  knocking on doors or shooting their way in.
*  We began to see the most terrifying scenes on TV of people calling in, whispering and
*  begging for help, saying, I can hear the gunmen, they're outside my house or in some cases
*  they're inside my house.
*  And we're talking here about families, grandparents, people with young children.
*  And then it began to emerge that there had also been an all-night rave not far from the
*  Gaza border.
*  Whoever tried to run away, they were shooting him from both sides.
*  And there were about 2,000 young Israelis who'd spent the night there and then found
*  themselves surrounded by gunmen.
*  The terrorists took out people from the car and just gunned them down.
*  Shooting into their cars, shooting at them as they ran on foot.
*  All the way people were dying, all the way on the road, young people.
*  So best were to hide.
*  There were people hiding in bushes and among the trees for hours in this open rural area
*  being hunted by these gunmen.
*  And it appears that both in the villages along the Gaza border and at the rave, the militants
*  were picking up sometimes injured Israelis and in many cases uninjured Israelis and just
*  taking them into Gaza as hostages.
*  There were whole families, there were young couples, there were elderly people.
*  This was a stunning and shocking scenario, a nightmare scenario for Israelis.
*  Very soon after the rocket fire of Saturday morning and the invasion of the gunmen, the
*  Israeli military puts planes in the sky and starts to strike in Gaza, across the Gaza
*  Strip.
*  And the government says it's trying to target cells and launching pads where the rockets
*  are being fired from.
*  But we know the strikes are deadly and often inflict casualties on Palestinian civilians
*  there.
*  And soon after that, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu comes on television with a recorded
*  statement and announces that Israel is calling up reserves for a retaliatory offensive in
*  Gaza and says that we are at war.
*  So this is just an extraordinary attack on so many levels, historic and a complete shock.
*  Do we have any sense of how this happened?
*  How was Hamas able to pull this off?
*  Well, that's the big question that everybody here is now asking because this was a complete
*  surprise.
*  Israel was caught completely off guard.
*  It's not clear how Hamas did this, but there are hints from Israeli officials now that
*  there's been some Iranian help.
*  We know that Iran has given logistical support to Hamas for years, and Hamas has just grown
*  in sophistication in terms of its military machine.
*  We've seen over the years its rockets reaching further and further into Israel, but nothing
*  on a scale like this because this was clearly such a well-planned and coordinated and multi-pronged
*  attack.
*  And how that could have all happened without Israel noticing is the question that everybody
*  here is now asking.
*  Well, let's talk about that.
*  Do we have a sense yet of how Israel didn't see this coming?
*  Well, first of all, people are baffled because Israel has such a vaunted intelligence apparatus.
*  So much has been invested in that border fence, in the fortifications.
*  For years, Israel was building a multi-billion shekel barrier that reaches underground in
*  order to stop Hamas militants or other militant groups coming into Israeli territory through
*  underground tunnels.
*  This is an incredibly sophisticated structure with sensors, cameras.
*  It's being watched all the time.
*  There are usually blimps in the air.
*  The fact that this was happening all along the fence and that these heavily armed forces
*  were just driving straight through overland, not underground, and reaching miles into Israeli
*  territory and nobody was there to stop them.
*  This was just an incredible failure.
*  Israel was caught totally off guard.
*  Many people here are saying Israel just took its eye off the ball.
*  In fact, the focus of the last few months for the military has been the West Bank, the
*  which is the other major territory with a population of millions of Palestinians and
*  hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers living among them and where we've seen bursts of
*  violence and increasing friction over the last few months.
*  And so they just didn't see this coming.
*  So they were totally blindsided.
*  Absolutely, absolutely.
*  And the shock of Saturday's events is now reverberating in Israel and throughout the
*  region.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Isabel, this attack just happened and you're still sorting through the details.
*  But I think the question many of us have at this point is why now?
*  Why did Hamas attack Israel from Gaza now?
*  Well, we don't exactly know, but Gaza has long presented a challenge for Israel on its
*  border.
*  Gaza is a narrow strip of land with two million Palestinians living there.
*  Many of them are refugees and the descendants of refugees from what was Palestine before
*  the state of Israel was founded.
*  And the place has been under blockade by Israel and neighboring Egypt for the last 16 years,
*  ever since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip.
*  So Gaza has long been compared by many to an open-air prison and frustration has just
*  been growing up there for years and years.
*  But when you ask why now, there have been shifts in the broader region for years.
*  Many of the Arab states refused to recognize or have diplomatic relations with Israel until
*  Israel and the Palestinians had found some resolution to their conflict.
*  But we've seen that beginning to change.
*  So in 2020, we saw several Arab countries deciding that they would normalize relations
*  with Israel while basically bypassing the Palestinians.
*  And now, in the last few weeks, we've seen increasingly open declarations that Saudi
*  Arabia, which is the big player in the region in this respect, is moving closer and closer
*  to a normalization deal with Israel.
*  And this is something that would be very threatening to Hamas and to the Palestinians in general,
*  who may fear being left behind.
*  And I assume this attack and Israel's declaration of war makes it more complicated for Saudi
*  Arabia to normalize relations with Israel.
*  I mean, this deal could be a tough sell for Saudi leaders if Israel is in an all-out war
*  with Palestinians in Gaza.
*  Sure.
*  I mean, the future path is now very unclear, but that could certainly be the case.
*  So that's one potential motivation, preventing a deal between Israel and the Saudis.
*  But we know Hamas isn't entirely alone in the region.
*  It has a strong backer, and that's Iran.
*  How might Iran factor in here?
*  Well, Iran would be no fan of this emerging Saudi deal with Israel, which is intended
*  to strengthen the anti-Iranian axis in the region.
*  Iran and Saudi Arabia are absolute rivals.
*  And in fact, what we've seen now is the Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, calling Ismail
*  Henea the leader of Hamas and expressing his appreciation for Saturday's invasion of Israeli
*  territory.
*  And he's quoted in a statement as saying, you have made the Islamic nation happy with
*  this initiative.
*  I mean, one thing that's really remarkable here is that this attack comes in a moment
*  of real upheaval inside Israel, right?
*  We've been covering this on the show.
*  They've been rolling political crises about the future of the judiciary in the country,
*  but that's brought around a real soul-searching among Israelis.
*  And at times, it's brought the country to a standstill.
*  There have been these rolling strikes.
*  People are out on the streets.
*  Do we know if this played a role in the timing of this attack?
*  Well, it's a really interesting question.
*  It could very well be that Hamas looked at what was going on in Israel and all the upheaval
*  and thought that this might be a good time to take Israel on because Israel appeared
*  to be weak.
*  This upheaval, the rifts in Israeli society over the far-right government's plans to
*  curb the judiciary have actually reached all the way into the army.
*  And we've seen thousands of Israeli reservists who've been threatening and declaring in
*  recent months that they would not show up for duty as volunteers anymore because they
*  felt that this government was undermining the democratic system that they had signed
*  up to defend.
*  But actually, what we've seen in the last 24 hours or 36 hours is an incredible turnaround
*  because we've seen the country putting its differences aside, at least temporarily, to
*  what many here see as a dire national emergency.
*  And we've seen the protest groups calling on the reservists to show up.
*  And the military has been telling me that actually in the call-up of the reserves, they've
*  had no refusals.
*  And I spoke to one of the leaders of the reservists who had been protesting against the government.
*  And he said to me, of course, I've shown up for duty.
*  This is a time of a national emergency.
*  And defending the citizens comes first.
*  Interesting.
*  So just a remarkable turnaround.
*  I mean, something we couldn't have imagined just weeks ago.
*  What about the political class and what's happening in high politics?
*  So even there, we're seeing now the leaders of the centrist opposition parties who had
*  vowed just weeks ago never to sit in a government with Benjamin Netanyahu, actually proposing,
*  forming a national unity government with him, an emergency government, to see Israel through
*  this crisis.
*  So if Hamas had thought that it was taking advantage of Israel's weakest moment, or one
*  of its weakest moments, perhaps they will find that this is backfired.
*  So Isabel, stepping back for a minute here, this is really a defining moment for Israel.
*  As you said earlier, on Saturday morning, Netanyahu made a declaration of war.
*  What has he done since then?
*  So late Saturday night, there was a meeting of the security cabinet.
*  The first objective is to clear out enemy forces and restore security.
*  The second is to exact an immense price from the enemy.
*  And in the early hours of Sunday morning, the government put out a statement in which
*  it said it was going to cut off power, electricity that it supplies to the Gaza Strip, as well
*  as fuel and goods.
*  Israel has continued with a relentless campaign of airstrikes.
*  It's now struck hundreds of targets within the Gaza Strip.
*  Entire apartment buildings, homes, schools and even a mosque.
*  It's taken down multi-storey buildings there.
*  The government, of course, warned Gaza residents to move out of certain areas and neighborhoods.
*  Many people there have nowhere to go.
*  And so there is a huge amount of panic on the ground.
*  We, like everyone here, are being oppressed.
*  Under the fire, the bombing all night long.
*  This building, 80 families lived here.
*  And we're seeing the death tolls on both sides rising.
*  And now we're seeing the army evacuating the residents of the Israeli communities along
*  the Gaza border, which is possibly an indication of a much larger offensive to come.
*  And that leads to the next question of whether Israel is planning to go into Gaza with its
*  ground forces.
*  Do you think that's a serious risk?
*  I mean, what are the chances Israel will actually invade the Gaza Strip?
*  Well, we don't know.
*  But if you listen to Netanyahu's words, he has said that all the sites in Gaza where
*  Hamas is deployed and is hiding and is operating from, he said, we will turn them into rubble.
*  He has told the Gazans, leave now because we will operate forcefully everywhere.
*  And I think you can't rule out listening to those words, that Israel will go as far as
*  it feels it needs to go to achieve its goals.
*  Isabel, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  By late in the night on Sunday, the death toll from the weekend's attack had risen
*  to 700 Israelis.
*  More than 400 Palestinians had been killed as Israel struck back.
*  While the precise number of Israelis captured and held hostage was unknown, a senior Hamas
*  official said Sunday that it was more than 100.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  The death toll from two major earthquakes in northwestern Afghanistan rose to at least
*  813 people on Sunday, making the quakes one of the deadliest natural disasters to hit
*  the country in decades.
*  The two earthquakes, both 6.3 magnitude, occurred along Afghanistan's border with Iran.
*  They were especially destructive because many homes in the region are made from mud
*  and bricks and collapsed instantly when the earthquake struck.
*  And in a surprise decision over the weekend, the governor of California, Gavin Newsom,
*  has vetoed a bill that would have made his state the first in the nation to outlaw discrimination
*  based on a person's caste, a social and religious hierarchy carried over from South Asia.
*  Proponents of the bill, which was the subject of a recent episode of The Daily, argued
*  that it would increase awareness of caste-based discrimination and encourage victims of it
*  to come forward.
*  But opponents, many of them Hindu, said it unfairly targeted them because the caste system
*  is most commonly associated with Hinduism.
*  In the end, Newsom sided with opponents, saying that the law was unnecessary because California
*  already prohibits discrimination on the basis of ancestry, religion and national origin.
*  Today's episode was produced by Rob Zipko, Sydney Harper and Will Reed with help from
*  Lindsay Garrison.
