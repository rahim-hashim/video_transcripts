# The Woman Who Fought the Texas Abortion Ban

*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernicee, and this is the Daily.
*  This week, a major abortion case in Texas drew attention to one of the most contentious
*  fights since the overturning of Roe v. Wade over the question of who can get exempted
*  from an abortion ban.
*  Most of the states that have banned abortion allow for rare exceptions, for example, if
*  the mother's life is in danger.
*  But while that might seem clear on paper, in practice, it's far more ambiguous.
*  As a result, that ambiguity is increasingly ending up in court.
*  Today, I speak to the woman at the heart of the case in Texas, and to my colleague, Kate
*  Zernichy, about its surprising effect.
*  It's Thursday, December 14th.
*  Kate, are you there?
*  Yeah, good.
*  Thank you.
*  Great.
*  And we know in the early ones.
*  We are.
*  I spoke with Kate Cox last week on the evening before her hearing at a Texas court.
*  Hi, Sabrina.
*  Nice to meet you.
*  Kate, really nice to meet you too.
*  Thank you.
*  So Kate, tell us a little bit about yourself.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm a Texan.
*  I'm a mother of two.
*  I have been in Texas.
*  Great tier.
*  I built my academic career and my professional career here in Texas to have a wonderful husband.
*  And we've always dreamed of a big family.
*  We have a three-year-old daughter and a one and a half-year-old son.
*  So thank you, Bark.
*  And full between the little ones and the folks working full-time.
*  I always like to call it Joyful Chaos.
*  I would love to have at least one more little one.
*  You know, it's not maybe two.
*  I would love a big family.
*  And we were really excited in August to receive the news of a third baby.
*  We'd been hoping for a third baby.
*  And our second born was finally sleeping through the night.
*  So felt like good timing.
*  It took a turn in October when we received the result from a screening that we had done.
*  Some people are familiar with these screening tests because you can also find out if you're
*  having a boy or girl.
*  So I was anxious for the results of the test to come back because we were very excited
*  to sign out if we were going to have a boy or girl.
*  And I got the result from a phone call directly from my doctor.
*  And when I answered the phone, I could hear the seriousness in her voice.
*  And so I pulled over.
*  And that's when the doctor told me that screening came back and showed an increased risk for
*  something called triton-18, also known as Edward Fendrom.
*  I'd never even heard of it.
*  Most cases do not make it to the end of pregnancy.
*  Many are still born.
*  And in our case, it has come with severe health issues of vital organs, including brain
*  development, heart development, spine, limb development, bugs, other things.
*  And so I was just in my car parked and just crying.
*  I felt frozen in that moment.
*  But I kind of told myself to have some hope because it wasn't a diagnosis.
*  It was a screening.
*  But every week was more bad news.
*  Each time we went back, not just to find the heart and the brain.
*  And so we knew and the target explained kind of feeling between both hope and there because
*  you're hopeful, well, the screen could be wrong.
*  And there might be a problem with the spine, but just to have a wonderful life in a wheelchair.
*  And then one of those last ultrasound I had done, my mother and I even, it's somehow
*  the result came back.
*  And this was not full triton-18.
*  It's the situation severe.
*  And the doctor said, yes, it's severe.
*  We have best hit scenario how much time might we have.
*  And she said, could be an hour, could be a week if she survived first.
*  So that was very hard to hear.
*  So we knew also I've been through two of these sections in the past, two births, Denago
*  according to plan.
*  I didn't want to see sections with either.
*  So I had a lot of questions about what the births might look like for this one and what
*  risks I could be facing or what that could mean for another baby as well.
*  And so I knew for my health and for the best chance of another baby and for the pain
*  and every day of having a baby and wondering, you know, feel a heart tick, wondering if
*  her heart had stopped, you know, so I can have that because you're mind.
*  Sorry.
*  I'm not asleep pregnant and I walk around a lot with two small children and, you know,
*  people smile at my belly or I see what I'm doing and she can fight that.
*  So the questions are hard.
*  So we knew for our family.
*  We knew what we wanted to do.
*  You said she is it a girl?
*  Yeah.
*  It's a girl.
*  And even though, you know, throughout the process, all times pointed to full triceme 18, we
*  wanted to wait and get the full result of the amniocin pieces.
*  And so we were waiting on those results.
*  The results and once we results came in, that's when we knew that's with full triceme
*  18.
*  And when did you get those final results full triceme 18?
*  Only last week.
*  How many weeks are you now, Kate?
*  I'm 20 weeks.
*  And we had talked to the doctor about, you know, what we, what do people do?
*  I felt though, I know I did, we'd be in a situation I have.
*  What do women do in the situations, which is not to continue the pregnancy?
*  Is that an option in Texas and shoots and nails?
*  I wanted to, on the one hand, do what I knew with best for my health and for a future
*  pregnancy and for my well-being and our family.
*  And at the same time, you know, felt really scary that you couldn't do that in my state
*  that I love deeply.
*  I'll admit, you know, working full time and two little ones that keep me busy.
*  I, I didn't know all the nuances of the law.
*  And but I imagined that there were exceptions.
*  And so I was very shocked that we did not fall into that exception in the situation that
*  we were in.
*  And so I was looking for stories online just to hear women's stories that had been through
*  what we were going through who'd had diagnosis like we got in their pregnancies.
*  And that's the one I came across, the Center for Reproductive Rights.
*  That's what brought me to reach out to get help and see, you know, where we could go.
*  And tell me Kate, where are you in the legal process now?
*  What's happening?
*  We have a hearing and so we're going to ask the state for TRO and we're going to, with
*  their approval, be able to access the medical care that I need here in Texas.
*  TRO, so temporary restraining order, which means you're asking the judge effectively, will
*  they make an exception and allow you to get an abortion in Texas?
*  Correct.
*  And how are you feeling about it, the hearing tomorrow?
*  I'm hopeful.
*  I'm hopeful that the state will be empathetic.
*  I'm, I love and I want this baby so badly.
*  There's nobody that loves and wants to save you all more than I do.
*  But there's no outcomes at the end of this where I take home a healthy baby girl.
*  And I want to do it's best for my health.
*  Sorry, I'm hopeful.
*  I think that they can look at me and look at my situation and see their wives, their daughter,
*  loved ones.
*  And we never thought that we'd be in this situation.
*  I never thought I would ever want or need an abortion.
*  But this is the medical decision and it's what's needed for my health.
*  Have you ever been in a court hearing before?
*  No, no, I've never been involved.
*  Yeah, this is very new for me.
*  Are you nervous?
*  I think I'm nervous every day.
*  I've been nervous since October when I started.
*  Yeah.
*  So, yeah, I mean, I'm human, if anybody would be.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm taking a nap though.
*  Good.
*  What are you going to do tonight, Kate?
*  Well, certainly try to get a little bit of sleep.
*  I couldn't get much last night's, but no last night I laid and we did shadow from the
*  wall with my daughter and she goes to her years old.
*  She brings me a lot of joy, talks are ear off, which is really, really fun.
*  So, to spend time and, you know, have the day these tight and hope for the best.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Kate, you've been covering abortion since the adoption of the last year and you've been
*  following Kate Cox's case over the past week.
*  Tell us what happened when she got to her hearing.
*  Well, first of all, we should say that Texas has some of the strictest abortion bands in
*  the country.
*  One is actually the band that was challenged in the original row case.
*  Another one is a more recent law that bands abortion after about six weeks when there
*  is fetal cardiac activity.
*  And for doctors violating these bands, performing an abortion can lead to 99 years in prison,
*  fines of $100,000 losing your medical license.
*  There are some limited exceptions, which are that you can perform an abortion if it is
*  to save the life of a pregnant woman or prevent her from substantial harm to a major bodily
*  function.
*  My name is Maya Guillare Gamble.
*  I'm the judge of the 459th District Court.
*  And I am hearing so this is a legal backdrop when the judge and the lawyers and Kate Cox
*  herself with her husband by her side gather on zoom for this emergency hearing.
*  We are here.
*  I don't have a cause number yet.
*  I just realized, oh, yes, I do.
*  I apologize.
*  We are here on Kate Cox, Justin Cox, and Damla Carson MD versus the state of Texas and
*  the Texas Medical Board.
*  All right.
*  So my name is Molly Dwayne for the plaintiffs.
*  Good morning and may it please the court.
*  Yes.
*  Thank you.
*  So Kate Cox is lawyer Molly Dwayne from the Center for Reproductive Rights essentially
*  makes two arguments about why Kate Cox should be allowed to have this abortion.
*  In the time between when this case was filed on Tuesday morning and are hearing today,
*  Miss Cox has had to visit the emergency room again.
*  Her fourth emergency room visit in the last month for pregnancy symptoms, including severe
*  cramps, leaking fluid and elevated vital signs.
*  The first is that Kate Cox's health really is at risk.
*  Today, we are seeking a temporary restraining order to allow Miss Cox to get the abortion
*  that she needs now to end her suffering and protect her fertility.
*  Second thing the Dwayne argues is that Miss Cox and her husband already have two children
*  and desperately want more.
*  Miss Cox's current pregnancy, however, has been diagnosed with full trisomy 18 and all
*  of her doctors have told her delivery of this pregnancy will be dangerous.
*  Not having this abortion puts Kate Cox's future fertility at risk.
*  If she is denied an abortion and instead forced to carry this pregnancy to term, her only
*  options in Texas are an induction or a C section, which both pose serious risks to her future
*  reproductive functions.
*  Kate Cox has already had two C sections, so the likelihood is if she's forced to carry
*  this fetus, she would have a third C section.
*  These sections can cause scarring and that scarring can cause infertility.
*  There's also a risk of uterine rupture or the chance up with a hysterectomy, in which
*  case she could not carry another child.
*  The only question that issue today is whether a TRO is necessary to prevent further injury
*  to Miss Cox while this case goes forward.
*  We believe that there can be no doubt on this record that the answer is yes.
*  Thank you, Your Honor.
*  And how does the state of Texas respond?
*  Thank you, Mr. Stone.
*  Well, with respect to the temporary restraining order, Your Honor, I have a few comments
*  I'd like to add.
*  The state says that this case is still hypothetical.
*  The Supreme Court has ruled that TROs cannot be used to obtain an advanced ruling on the
*  merits.
*  Essentially, Kate Cox is not facing an immediate risk to her health or her life.
*  Because the plan is not alleged that they are eligible for the medical exception just
*  on the face of the pleading and in the text of the TRO itself.
*  The second thing they say is that the standard is very clear.
*  So the medical exception in Texas is an objective standard, just like the standard of care,
*  but right in the law, in black and white, when you can get an exception.
*  To determine whether a person qualifies for the medical exception, a physician must determine
*  that they qualify based on the reasonable medical judgment that's an objective standard.
*  The plaintiffs are asking this court to change that objective standard to a subjective standard.
*  They argue that the Center for Reproductive Rights and Kate Cox are trying to change that
*  standard on the fly and make it sort of much more fuzzy.
*  I also want to talk about the expert declaration we attached.
*  Dr. Scott, who you heard them mention, reviewed their pleading in this case and submitted a declaration
*  stating that she does not believe that they have sufficiently alleged the elements of the
*  medical exception to Texas's abortion loss, just on the face.
*  What they're arguing about here is really the crux of these exceptions cases.
*  How sick do you have to be?
*  How much of a risk to your health does there have to be for a doctor to say in my reasonable
*  medical judgment, this woman should have an abortion?
*  The TRO is an extraordinary relief.
*  It's meant to maintain the status quo of the parties and prevent an immediate and irreparable
*  harm.
*  And in this case, the plaintiffs have simply not shown that they meet that standard.
*  For that reason, this court should deny it.
*  Is that all?
*  Yes, Your Honor.
*  Thank you.
*  And what is the lawyer for Cox say to that?
*  Like, what's her response?
*  All right, Ms. Stoyne.
*  Thank you, Your Honor.
*  A couple of points in response.
*  They argue that in fact, the law is not clear.
*  The state says that Ms. Cox doesn't meet the elements of the exception, but we don't
*  know what the state thinks those elements are.
*  Those two vague doctors have not been able to interpret it.
*  I read the statute, Dr. Carson reads the statute, to say that a serious risk of substantial
*  impairment of Ms. Cox's reproductive functions would fall within the medical exception.
*  If that is not what the statute means, then the state, after two years of silence, really
*  ought to tell us.
*  The law now says that doctors can use their reasonable medical judgment to determine whether
*  or not a woman should have an abortion because of an exception.
*  But K. Cox's lawyers point out and Dr. Sphere that the state is always going to be able
*  to find some medical expert who can go into court and say that medical judgment was not
*  reasonable.
*  And so therefore, doctors really are at risk of prosecution in all of these cases.
*  Yes, a physician has affirmed that this care is medically necessary.
*  Ms. Cox's condition is rapidly deteriorating every day.
*  And just by the plain language of the statute, her condition falls within the exception, whatever
*  it is that that exception means.
*  Thank you.
*  All right, well, as I said, I spent a considerable amount of time yesterday reading and preparing
*  for today.
*  And surprisingly, I am going to grant the temporary restraining order for Ms. Cox, Mr.
*  Cox, and Dr. Carson.
*  The judge rules instantaneously right at the end of the hearing.
*  And her words are really pretty powerful.
*  The idea that Ms. Cox wants desperately to be apparent and this law might actually cause
*  her to lose that ability is shocking and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice.
*  And they show the power of pregnant woman like Kate Cox coming before the court in this
*  way.
*  So I will be signing the order and it will be processed and sent out today.
*  Anything else?
*  Thank you, Your Honor, nothing from the plaintiffs.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Good luck, everyone.
*  That concludes this hearing and I'm going to shut down the Zoom.
*  I have to say, it really caught our attention when we saw the outcome here because I thought,
*  hey, this is Texas.
*  This is a state that has very strict bans.
*  How did this woman achieve this?
*  Well, the first thing I should say is that this lower court was in Travis County, which
*  is Austin.
*  It's one of the most liberal blue cities in Texas to blue dot in a sea of red.
*  And it's a lower court.
*  So yes, this judge says that Kate Cox can have an abortion, but we know that this is not
*  yet the end of the story.
*  Right.
*  Okay, so keep going with the story.
*  What happens next?
*  Texas's attorney general Ken Paxton, who's famously anti abortion, very conservative, immediately
*  appeals the ruling.
*  And hours after the judge's decision, he sends letters to the hospitals where Kate Cox's
*  doctor has admitting privileges and writes that even if Kate Cox is allowed to have this
*  abortion, that will not insulate her doctor from prosecution.
*  So don't think that we're not going to come after you.
*  So basically threatening legal action of the doctor that would potentially perform the
*  procedure.
*  And we should remind people here, doctors and hospitals can be criminally liable in these
*  cases.
*  So what does Kate do?
*  Well, Kate Cox knows what an uphill battle this is going to be.
*  And so she decides to leave the state and have an abortion elsewhere.
*  We don't know where, but we do know that she's left the state.
*  She's essentially saying, I'm going to go before the clock runs out.
*  If I sit around and wait for this to be resolved, I may be at a point where I can't even
*  get an abortion in another state.
*  It will be too late.
*  Right.
*  And what happens with the legal case?
*  A new twist in a Texas woman's challenge to one of the country's most restrictive abortion
*  laws.
*  Texas Supreme Court blocks that lower court ruling.
*  In the ruling tonight, the court said that difficulties in pregnancy, even serious ones,
*  do not pose the heightened risk to the mother that the state's exceptions for a mother whose
*  life is in danger encompasses.
*  And say the lower court ruling was a mistake that Kate Cox, in fact, did not meet the
*  standard for an exception.
*  And this is somebody who's just said, oh, I'm going to have one.
*  This is somebody who is in desperate need for all the complications she's going through.
*  This case was everywhere.
*  People were talking about it.
*  Abortion is health care.
*  Period.
*  People were debating it.
*  This is a case.
*  I know women just like this.
*  I know two women in very similar circumstances.
*  This woman's life is at risk.
*  The baby most definitely is not going to survive in her future fertility, a woman who wants
*  to have a child that is jeopardized in it.
*  And lawyers say that, in fact, cases like Cox's are actually fairly common.
*  And there are other cases that are being fought in court in a number of other states.
*  Tell me about some of those cases.
*  One of the first places it came up was in Louisiana, where there was a very prominent story
*  about a woman who was pregnant with a fetus that had no skull.
*  And the state of Louisiana, which again is one of these really strict band states and abortion,
*  had exceptions where you could get an abortion.
*  But this particular condition, known as a craniot, that was not on the list of conditions.
*  So then the question becomes, okay, we're going to add that condition.
*  But at what point do you have to have something broader?
*  Can you just incrementally keep adding these different conditions?
*  Or do you have to answer the broader case of like, what does it mean to be sick?
*  What makes a woman's life at risk?
*  Right. That seems to be a very problematic issue for the law and the legislature.
*  Do you just keep adding things?
*  How do you even know?
*  Right. And since then lawyers for the Center of reproductive rights,
*  the people who filed K Cox's case have filed other lawsuits.
*  So they are in Tennessee and Oklahoma and Idaho.
*  And in another case in Texas, which has multiple women.
*  And tell me about that case.
*  Well, the lead plaintiff in that case is a woman named Amanda Zoroski.
*  She became pregnant after about a year and a half of fertility treatments,
*  very much a wanted pregnancy.
*  Then at 18 weeks, her water broke, which really puts the fetus at risk.
*  The fetus was unlikely to live.
*  But that fetus still had what doctors were calling a heartbeat.
*  So they told her that under Texas law, she could not have an abortion.
*  So she goes home and she becomes septic and she goes back to the hospital and she ends up
*  being really sick. And so finally, doctors say, okay, there's no longer a heartbeat.
*  And she's actually facing death.
*  We're going to do this abortion.
*  But she ends up with so much scar tissue from that operation that one of her fallopian tubes
*  is permanently closed.
*  And it's unlikely that she will be able to carry another child.
*  So it sounds like the lead plaintiff in this Texas case is a very vivid example of this argument
*  you're talking about, right?
*  The state law might seem black and white, might look neat on paper,
*  but it's not neat in real life because medical decisions are fundamentally about
*  probabilities.
*  What if there's a 30% chance you'll die?
*  Is that enough?
*  Or does it have to be an 80% chance you'll die?
*  Right. And the other thing to remember is that medical situations can change so quickly.
*  You can be fine one minute and suddenly there's a real emergency risk to your life.
*  And what their lawyers are saying is that women across the country are struggling with this
*  question. Doctors are struggling with this question.
*  We need clarity on what exactly are the exceptions.
*  But I guess I'm wondering Kate, what's ultimately the point here?
*  I mean, you said, you know, it's to clarify exceptions.
*  But what's the end goal?
*  Like, is it to get one of these cases up to the Supreme Court?
*  You know, to find one precedent that could kind of wave a legal wand for the whole country?
*  I don't think that is the goal. I think the way to think about this is if you think about
*  the way conservatives went after abortion after row, they figured out pretty quickly that they
*  were not going to be able to, as you say, you know, wave some magic wand and get rid of it across
*  the country. But what they did instead was start proposing laws that would limit the circumstances
*  where you could have an abortion.
*  This goes in the opposite direction by making people consider all the cases in which you would
*  need an abortion. And in the same way that anti-abortion groups change the conversation around
*  abortion by, for instance, talking about partial birth abortion and making people really uncomfortable
*  with that idea, all of these cases around the exceptions are changing the conversation about abortion.
*  It's really shaking up how we've thought about abortion for 50 years and really how the anti-abortion
*  movement has taught us to think about abortion for 50 years.
*  For a really long time now, people have had this stereotype that women who get abortions are
*  teenagers and irresponsible women who use abortion for birth control. The more we hear stories
*  like this, the more that stereotype is being countered. The other thing that's changing is that
*  for a really long time, pollsters have had us think about abortion in terms of your either pro-life
*  or your pro-choice. What we're discovering is that there's a lot of room in the middle and in fact
*  in the middle is where most voters are. And voters are starting to think about, well, in what cases
*  would I want someone to be able to have an abortion? These cases around the exceptions are really
*  what's changing this middle ground. And we've seen, of course, in elections recently abortion
*  being kind of a winner for Democrats, you know, that the right to the procedures more or less
*  something people approve of. That's exactly right. The whole dynamic around abortion has changed. We
*  are in a very much different place on public opinion than people anticipated immediately post-dobs.
*  One poll, for instance, surveyed people in these very strict ban states and found that people
*  actually didn't know what the law was. But when you told them how strict it was, they wanted to add
*  exceptions and said they would support ballot measures, adding these exceptions for, you know,
*  the life of the mother or fatal fetal conditions, rape, incest. The other thing that polls have shown us
*  is that people who hear these stories are more likely to support ballot measures, not just allowing
*  exceptions, but establishing a right to abortion and state constitutions.
*  Cases like K-Cox's may have only limited legal effect, but the stories that K-Cox and women
*  like her are telling, we've already seen they're having enormous effect on public opinion over time.
*  K-Cox, thank you Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court agreed to rule on the
*  availability of a commonly used abortion pill. The first major abortion case that the court has
*  taken since it overturned the constitutional right to the procedure more than a year ago.
*  The Biden administration had asked the justices to intervene after the Court of Appeals for the Fifth
*  Circuit, favored curbing distribution of the drug known as Mifapristone, in a surprise ruling
*  earlier this year that involved skepticism about the federal government's drug regulation.
*  The move sets up a high stakes fight over the pill, which accounts for a significant share of
*  abortions in the United States, and could sharply curtail access to the medication, even in states
*  where abortion is legal. The Supreme Court did not set a date for argument, but is expected to
*  issue a decision by the end of its term in late June. Today's episode was produced by Lindsay
*  Garrison, Jessica Chung and Mary Wilson. It was edited by Lisa Chow and Brendan Klingkenberg.
