*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Barrow. This is the Daily.
*  Today, from the moment that Roe v. Wade was overturned, the question was just how much
*  it would reduce abortions across the U.S. Now, more than a year later, the numbers are
*  in. And as my colleague, Margot Sanger-Cats explains, they are not what anyone had expected.
*  It's Wednesday, November 29.
*  Margot just a few days after Roe v. Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court. You came
*  on the daily to describe the new legal landscape of abortion in the U.S. What a new state-by-state
*  post-Rome map of access and restriction would look like as a result of that court decision.
*  And the question back then was, what was going to be the impact of that new map on the
*  number of abortions in the U.S. But of course, we didn't have any data back then.
*  That's true. It was a really an open question. If all of these states banned abortion, what
*  was going to happen to the women who used to have abortions in those states? Would they
*  travel to another state and get an abortion anyway? Would they order pills from overseas
*  through kind of not totally legal methods and have illegal abortions? Would they have less
*  sex or use more birth control and become less likely to be pregnant? Or would they end
*  up carrying pregnancies to term that they would have terminated in the past? And there
*  would be more babies. And because it takes a long time for a baby to gestate and be born,
*  we have sort of been waiting for a long time to see what happened. And now more than a year
*  after Roe was overturned, we finally have the answer.
*  And what is the answer?
*  So the newest data that we have and we think the best data actually looked at how many
*  births happened in the aftermath of the DOBS decision. That was the decision that overturned
*  Roe versus Wade. And what we found out is that in every one of the 13 states that banned
*  abortion immediately after the Supreme Court decision, births increased.
*  Every single one of them. That's right. They didn't all increase by the
*  same amount. And we can talk more about what I think is driving those differences. But
*  it was a very consistent result across all of these states.
*  And by how much did births increase in those 13 states?
*  So the researchers that did this study estimated that in the first six months of this year,
*  there were about 32,000 more babies born in those states than they would have expected.
*  It's about a 2.3% increase if you compare states that banned abortions to the states that
*  didn't ban abortions. And you know, that's a small difference. But when you think about
*  how few pregnancies ended in abortion before, it's actually pretty big difference. About
*  25% of women who we might have expected to end their pregnancies ended up carrying their
*  pregnancies to term.
*  I'm curious, how do the researchers know that the rising birth to rate in these 13 states
*  represents the influence of row being overturned and these state abortion bands could anything
*  else potentially explain higher birth rates in these states?
*  So obviously the research that's just looking at the number of births, it can't answer
*  the question for any individual woman. You know, what did she want to do? What would
*  she have done in a different policy environment? But the researchers did a very complicated
*  economics style analysis where they looked at the trends before this policy change in all
*  the states. And then they looked at what happened after the policy changed. And what they
*  saw is that the states that didn't ban abortion, things kind of looked about the same.
*  You know, births were going down, they kept going down, births were holding steady, they
*  continued to hold steady. But in the states that banned abortion, there's a huge divergence,
*  there's a chart in the study that is just like you see it and you're like, oh my goodness,
*  something changed at exactly the time that you would have expected, which is that all
*  of these states suddenly start seeing an increased births about six to seven months after abortion
*  was banned in their state. So the researchers were able to say with some confidence, you
*  know, they can't be a thousand percent sure. But there's nothing else that really would
*  explain why you would see this big change in trends in only these states.
*  Right. Okay. So you had told us back in June of 2022 that when it comes to abortion
*  access, bands in certain states would matter much more than bands in other states. So
*  talk us through the geography of where these birth increases happen, where they were
*  biggest or smallest and what that tells us about this post row map of abortion access.
*  Yeah. So if you think about the typical patient who seeks an abortion tends to be a relatively
*  young woman in her 20s, a woman who already has another child, and I think very importantly,
*  also a woman who is poor or close to poor. So these are women for whom long distances are
*  really huge hurdle. They're going to have to find a way to get to a clinic in another
*  state. They may have to take time off from work or arrange childcare for their existing
*  children. And so what our expectation was is that the further women had to go to get to
*  the nearest abortion clinic, the more likely they were going to be deterred from having an abortion,
*  because just all of those financial and logistical hurdles were piling up and making it more difficult
*  for them. Right. And essentially what this new study shows is that that intuition was correct.
*  If you look at the states that banned abortion, they are largely clustered in the south, where
*  women have to travel the longest distance to get to an abortion clinic. Those were the places where
*  we saw the largest increases in births. Give us some examples. So Texas is a huge state with
*  really large distances. And Texas saw the largest increase in births in this period. And the
*  state that had the second largest increase in births is Mississippi. And that's a state that's
*  surrounded by a lot of other states that also banned abortion. You know, Arkansas,
*  band abortion, Tennessee, band abortion, and then heading north Missouri, Kentucky, West Virginia.
*  So hundreds of miles of travel to get to the nearest abortion clinic. And what we see again is that
*  the births in those states increased by the most of any of the states that had abortion bands.
*  So that makes sense. The impact of these bands is clearly greatest, where it takes the longest
*  to get to a state where it's not banned. What about in the states where abortion is banned,
*  but neighboring states have not banned it. And therefore, the distance to an abortion clinic
*  is small. What is the data show there? So the data shows that where the distances are relatively
*  short, there was still an increase in the birth rate, but it was not as large. And I think the best
*  example of this is Missouri. In Missouri before row was overturned, there was only one abortion
*  clinic in the whole state. And it was located right near the Illinois border. So when Missouri
*  band abortion, that clinic closed, but women seeking an abortion only had to drive two miles
*  further to get to the nearest clinic in Illinois than they did before. And so of all of the states
*  that banned abortion, we see the smallest effect on the birth rate in Missouri.
*  We're talking about women crossing state lines to get abortions, but of course,
*  that's not the only option. Does this data help us at all understand how many women in the states
*  where abortion is banned are pursuing an abortion through other means?
*  So it tells us a little bit about that. We have known for some time that women are ordering pills
*  through these kind of quasi legal means where they're getting them from other countries
*  through the mail. So there are websites where you can go and order abortion pills they come to you
*  usually from India. And the largest provider of those pills has actually been publicly reporting
*  the data on how many orders they've been getting. And we can see that the states where they
*  have been sending a lot of pills seemed to have a smaller increase in the birth rate than we
*  might expect just based on driving distance alone. So that suggests to me and to these researchers
*  that probably those pills are acting as a substitute for travel for some of those women. So an
*  example of that is Arkansas. Arkansas is a state that banned abortion and the birth rate did go up
*  in Arkansas, but it didn't go up by as much as you would have expected just based on the driving
*  distances alone. And we also know that Arkansas was a state where a lot of women order these
*  pills from overseas. But why would women in Arkansas be much more likely to order these pills
*  from overseas to the mail than in any other state where abortion is banned? I don't think that we
*  really know the answer to that question. I think the opportunity to order these pills overseas
*  is kind of new. And so the word about them may be spreading in sort of uneven ways through different
*  parts of the country. I also think that women in different states may think about the legal risk
*  of pursuing this option differently. Texas, for example, is a state where law enforcement and
*  other state officials have made it really clear that they want to vigorously enforce their abortion
*  ban. Right. So that might be a place where on the margin, women are a little bit less likely to
*  order pills because they're worried that they could get in trouble. Mm-hmm. So in thinking back to
*  where we started, the effect of overturning row on access to abortion, what does this data really
*  revealing? I think it shows us that abortion vans do work. In all of these states that banned
*  abortions, we're seeing births going up. And that's pretty clear. But I think just looking at what
*  happened in those 13 states actually doesn't give us the full picture of what's happened over
*  the last year since Rovers' Wade was overturned. If you look at other data and see what's
*  happening nationwide, the total number of abortions actually hasn't gone down. Instead,
*  something interesting and a little bit surprising has happened. Abortions are going up.
*  We'll be right back. Margot, just before the break, you said that despite these state abortion
*  bans, abortions are somehow up nationwide, which seems very counterintuitive. So just explain
*  that. Yeah, I mean, I have to admit that I was a little bit surprised when I saw these numbers.
*  I should say this is not a huge increase. The estimate is that the number of abortions since
*  the Supreme Court decision only went up by like 0.2%, but when you consider that there are all
*  these states that banned abortion totally, where abortions went to zero, what it's really telling us
*  is that the states were abortion-stayed legal increased by so much that they were able to sort of
*  counterweight that reduction. And I think there are a couple of factors that really explain what's
*  going on here. One is that we know that even though there's women who are prevented from having
*  abortions in the states that banned it, there are a lot of women that are still getting out,
*  who are still traveling to neighboring states. And when you look at data on the number of abortions
*  that are being provided around the country, you can see really large increases in some of these
*  border states that women are attending to go to. Places like Kansas, New Mexico, Illinois, North
*  Carolina, these are states that are neighboring places where abortion is banned and there's been a big
*  growth in abortion infrastructure to accommodate those women and they are traveling there and they
*  are getting abortions. But what's really interesting and I think more surprising in this data is that
*  we also see increases in states where they're just not that close to the places that banned abortion,
*  like California has had a pretty substantial increase in the number of abortions that it's provided.
*  And some of the states in the Northeast have had pretty big increases and I think that suggests
*  that there's something more going on than just women traveling out of the states with bans that
*  actually there are more women in some of these states where abortion remained legal,
*  who are having abortions in this post-row period than would have had them in the pre-row period.
*  And why would that be? Why would there be more women having abortions in states where it was
*  always legal after Rose overturned and it remained legal? So I think the biggest reason is that right
*  around the same time that the Supreme Court overturned the road decision, the Biden administration
*  changed the rules for how women can get abortion pills in the United States. So the abortion
*  pill has been legal for 20 years, but for most of that time, if you wanted to take abortion pills,
*  you had to go to a physical clinic, meet with a doctor in person, and then they would give you the
*  pill in person and you would take the first pill at the visit and then take additional medicine
*  home with you. And so that meant that medication abortion really wasn't that much easier for women
*  than procedural abortion because they still had to go to a clinic that might be pretty far from
*  their house. And it was still pretty expensive. What the new rules allow is that you can get abortions
*  through telemedicine. And with these telemedicine abortions women could talk to a doctor from their
*  home and then have abortion pills mailed to their home and then they could take the abortion
*  pills at home. And that change made abortion less expensive in a lot of cases, and it also made
*  it much more convenient for women who didn't live near an abortion clinic. You know, we were talking
*  before about the driving distances. And so of course, if you live in Texas or Mississippi and there's
*  no abortion clinic within hundreds of miles, driving distances really important. But even in states where
*  abortion had always been legal, and again, I think California is a good example, you know, if you lived
*  kind of in central California, you might be pretty far from an abortion clinic before. And so
*  this regulatory change, I think made it a little easier for some of those women to get abortions.
*  The other thing that happened is that once that policy went into place, there was actually a big
*  kind of startup movement. They almost feel a little bit like tech startups in the abortion space now
*  where they feel like, okay, we can have some doctors who can like work remotely and can provide
*  abortions through the internet to women. And so that's been like an increase in the number of
*  providers that are available for those women. So since we're the infrastructure for abortions that
*  don't require going to a clinic expands dramatically from what you're saying.
*  Yeah, but I think that's not the only thing that happened. I think for a lot of people
*  who had not been paying attention to abortion in the recent years, the overturning of Roe was like
*  a huge activating moment. And we have seen in the last year a lot of fundraising and money being
*  poured into the abortion system and awareness of abortion and the options for abortion growing.
*  And we've also seen a lot of these states that always had legal abortion have started pursuing
*  new policies to make abortion even easier to get and less expensive. States have required
*  insurance companies to cover abortion. They've provided extra legal protections for doctors that
*  provide abortion. They've allowed nurse practitioners and other kinds of people to provide
*  abortions in their states. And I think all of that is sort of a political reaction to the Supreme
*  Court decision. And those changes might not have happened in the absence of it. And all of those
*  changes probably also helped make abortion a little bit more available to women in those states
*  and also probably raised their awareness that abortion was an option for them.
*  So in these states, and this is counterintuitive, the overturning of Roe leads to greater access
*  to abortions, kind of a mirror image to the 13 states that banned it. And therefore, according to
*  this data, there are more abortions in these states. That's right. I mean, we don't know what's
*  going to happen in the future and the trends could reverse. But I actually think it's possible that
*  we're going to see an even larger increase in the number of abortions nationwide. Because all
*  this data we've been talking about are a little old. The most recent data about the number of
*  abortions comes from this summer. But since then, there's been a pretty important change, which is
*  that a bunch of these states that kept abortion legal have past laws that allow doctors there to
*  mail abortion pills into states with bans. And they will protect them from extradition. So if you're
*  a doctor in New York in the first year in which Roe was overturned, you would not want to treat
*  a patient in Texas. And you would not want to mail abortion pills into Texas because abortion is
*  illegal in Texas and authorities could come and arrest you potentially. And what New York and
*  Massachusetts and a couple of other states have done is they've passed laws where they said, no, no,
*  if you go to Texas, you could get arrested. But as long as you stay here in your home state of New
*  New York, we will make sure that you're not going to get in any legal trouble. And as a result of
*  that, there are doctors who are setting up shop and sending large numbers of pills into these
*  bans states. And because of that, researchers I talked to think that we could see an even larger
*  number of abortions happening this year than we saw last year. I mean, all this Margot suggests
*  that while abortion bans have worked in the states where they're in place during this first year,
*  post-Roe, overall, the strategy of trying to overturn Roe and therefore reduce abortion has kind
*  of backfired, right? And it may continue to backfire more and more over time. Yeah, I think it has
*  backfired. If you think about the activists that brought this case to the Supreme Court, their goal
*  is not just to reduce abortions in Texas and Mississippi. They really wanted to reduce abortions
*  across the entire country. And I think we've all been really focused on the states that were
*  banning abortion. But there was also this huge change that happened in the states that didn't
*  ban abortion, which is a lot of states. And I think that's why we see abortions going up by so much.
*  I don't know that the anti-abortion activists could have ever predicted that this would be the
*  effect of the end of Roe. And I don't even think that the abortion rights activists saw this coming.
*  I think everyone assumed that the end of Roe was going to mean a decrease in abortions, not an increase.
*  Umargo, thank you very much. We appreciate it. Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. On Tuesday, the fifth day of the ceasefire between
*  Hamas and Israel. Hamas released 12 more hostages from Gaza, including 10 Israelis and two
*  Thai nationals, while Israel released 30 Palestinians from Israeli prisons. Overall,
*  Hamas has released 85 hostages since the ceasefire began, and Israel has freed 180 imprisoned Palestinians.
*  And the powerful political network led by conservative billionaire Charles Koch
*  has endorsed former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley for president. The latest boost to her
*  Republican candidacy, which has steadily risen in the polls. The endorsement gives Haley's campaign
*  much needed organizational muscle and financial might and cements her place as the favorite candidate
*  of Republican donors seeking to stop Donald Trump from becoming the nominee.
