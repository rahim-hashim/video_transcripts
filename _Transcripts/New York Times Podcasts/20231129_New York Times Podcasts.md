# Ending Roe Was Supposed to Reduce Abortions. It Didn’t.
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhUUFVQ02pA)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, from the moment that Roe vs. Wade was overturned, the question was just how much
*  it would reduce abortions across the U.S.
*  Now, more than a year later, the numbers are in.
*  And as my colleague Margot Sanger Katz explains, they are not what anyone had expected.
*  It's Wednesday, November 29th.
*  Margot, just a few days after Roe vs. Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court, you came
*  on The Daily to describe the new legal landscape of abortion in the U.S., what a new state-by-state
*  post-Roe map of access and restriction was going to look like as a result of that court
*  decision.
*  And the question back then was, what was going to be the impact of that new map on the number
*  of abortions in the U.S.?
*  But of course, we didn't have any data back then.
*  It's true.
*  It was really an open question.
*  If all of these states banned abortion, what was going to happen to the women who used
*  to have abortions in those states?
*  Would they travel to another state and get an abortion anyway?
*  Would they order pills from overseas through kind of not totally legal methods and have
*  illegal abortions?
*  Would they have less sex or use more birth control and become less likely to be pregnant?
*  Or would they end up carrying pregnancies to term that they would have terminated in
*  the past and there would be more babies?
*  And because it takes a long time for a baby to gestate and be born, we have sort of been
*  waiting for a long time to see what happened.
*  And now, more than a year after Roe was overturned, we finally have the answer.
*  And what is the answer?
*  So the newest data that we have and we think the best data actually looked at how many
*  births happened in the aftermath of the Dobbs decision.
*  That was the decision that overturned Roe versus Wade.
*  And what we found out is that in every one of the 13 states that banned abortion immediately
*  after the Supreme Court decision, births increased.
*  Every single one of them.
*  That's right.
*  Didn't all increase by the same amount.
*  And we can talk more about what I think is driving those differences.
*  But it was a very consistent result across all of these states.
*  And by how much did births increase in those 13 states?
*  So the researchers that did this study estimated that in the first six months of this year,
*  there were about 32,000 more babies born in those states than they would have expected.
*  That's about a 2.3% increase if you compare states that banned abortions to the states
*  that didn't ban abortions.
*  And you know, that's a small difference.
*  But when you think about how few pregnancies ended in abortion before, it's actually a
*  pretty big difference.
*  About 25% of women who we might have expected to end their pregnancies ended up carrying
*  their pregnancies to term.
*  I'm curious, how do the researchers know that the rising birth rate in these 13 states
*  represents the influence of Roe being overturned and these state abortion bans?
*  Could anything else potentially explain higher birth rates in these states?
*  So obviously, the research that's just looking at the number of births, it can't answer the
*  question for any individual woman.
*  You know, what did she want to do?
*  What would she have done in a different policy environment?
*  The researchers did a very complicated economics style analysis where they looked at the trends
*  before this policy change in all the states.
*  And then they looked at what happened after the policy changed.
*  And what they saw is that the states that didn't ban abortion, things kind of looked
*  about the same.
*  You know, births were going down, they kept going down.
*  If births were holding steady, they continued to hold steady.
*  But in the states that banned abortion, there's a huge divergence.
*  There's a chart in the study that is just like you see it and you're like, oh my goodness,
*  something changed at exactly the time that you would have expected, which is that all
*  of these states suddenly start seeing an increased births about six to seven months after abortion
*  was banned in their state.
*  So the researchers were able to say with some confidence, you know, they can't be a thousand
*  percent sure.
*  But there's nothing else that really would explain why you would see this big change
*  in trends in only these states.
*  Right.
*  So you had told us back in June of 2022 that when it comes to abortion access, bans in
*  certain states would matter much more than bans in other states.
*  So talk us through the geography of where these birth increases happened, where they
*  were biggest or smallest, and what that tells us about this post-RO map of abortion access.
*  Yeah, so if you think about the typical patient who seeks an abortion tends to be a relatively
*  young woman in her 20s, a woman who already has another child, and I think very importantly,
*  also a woman who is poor or close to poor.
*  So these are women for whom long distances are a really huge hurdle.
*  They're going to have to find a way to get to a clinic in another state.
*  They may have to take time off from work or arrange child care for their existing children.
*  And so what our expectation was is that the further women had to go to get to the nearest
*  abortion clinic, the more likely they were going to be deterred from having an abortion
*  because just all of those financial and logistical hurdles were piling up and making it more
*  difficult for them.
*  Right.
*  And essentially what this new study shows is that that intuition was correct.
*  If you look at the states that banned abortion, they are largely clustered in the South, where
*  women have to travel the longest distance to get to an abortion clinic.
*  Those were the places where we saw the largest increases in births.
*  Give us some examples.
*  So Texas is a huge state with really large distances, and Texas saw the largest increase
*  in births in this period.
*  And the state that had the second largest increase in births is Mississippi.
*  And that's a state that's surrounded by a lot of other states that also banned abortion.
*  You know, Arkansas banned abortion, Tennessee banned abortion, and then heading north, Missouri,
*  Kentucky, West Virginia.
*  So hundreds of miles of travel to get to the nearest abortion clinic.
*  And what we see again is that the births in those states increased by the most of any
*  of the states that had abortion bans.
*  So that makes sense.
*  The impact of these bans is clearly greatest, where it takes the longest to get to a state
*  where it's not banned.
*  What about in the states where abortion is banned, but neighboring states have not banned
*  it, and therefore the distance to an abortion clinic is smaller?
*  What does the data show there?
*  So the data shows that where the distances are relatively short, there was still an increase
*  in the birth rate, but it was not as large.
*  And I think the best example of this is Missouri.
*  In Missouri, before Roe was overturned, there was only one abortion clinic in the whole
*  And it was located right near the Illinois border.
*  So when Missouri banned abortion, that clinic closed.
*  But women seeking an abortion only had to drive two miles further to get to the nearest
*  clinic in Illinois than they did before.
*  And so of all of the states that banned abortion, we see the smallest effect on the birth rate
*  in Missouri.
*  We're talking about women crossing state lines to get abortions, but of course, that's not
*  the only option.
*  Does this data help us at all understand how many women in the states where abortion is
*  banned are pursuing an abortion through other means?
*  So it tells us a little bit about that.
*  We have known for some time that women are ordering pills through these kind of quasi-legal
*  means where they're getting them from other countries through the mail.
*  So there are websites where you can go and order abortion pills.
*  They come to you usually from India.
*  And the largest provider of those pills has actually been publicly reporting the data
*  on how many orders they've been getting.
*  And we can see that the states where they have been sending a lot of pills seem to have
*  a smaller increase in the birth rate than we might expect just based on driving distance
*  alone.
*  So that suggests to me and to these researchers that probably those pills are acting as a
*  substitute for travel for some of those women.
*  So an example of that is Arkansas.
*  Arkansas is a state that banned abortion and the birth rate did go up in Arkansas, but
*  it didn't go up by as much as you would have expected just based on the driving distances
*  alone.
*  And we also know that Arkansas was a state where a lot of women ordered these pills from
*  overseas.
*  But why would women in Arkansas be much more likely to order these pills from overseas
*  through the mail than in any other state where abortion is banned?
*  I don't think that we really know the answer to that question.
*  I think the opportunity to order these pills overseas is kind of new.
*  And so the word about them may be spreading in sort of uneven ways through different parts
*  of the country.
*  I also think that women in different states may think about the legal risk of pursuing
*  this option differently.
*  Texas, for example, is a state where law enforcement and other state officials have made it really
*  clear that they want to vigorously enforce their abortion ban.
*  So that might be a place where on the margin women are a little bit less likely to order
*  pills because they're worried that they could get in trouble.
*  So in thinking back to where we started, the effect of overturning Roe on access to abortion,
*  what is this data really revealing?
*  I think it shows us that abortion bans do work.
*  In all of these states that banned abortions, we're seeing births going up.
*  And that's pretty clear.
*  But I think just looking at what happened in those 13 states actually doesn't give
*  us the full picture of what's happened over the last year since Roe versus Wade was overturned.
*  If you look at other data and see what's happening nationwide, the total number of abortions
*  actually hasn't gone down.
*  Instead, something interesting and a little bit surprising has happened.
*  Abortions are going up.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Margot, just before the break, you said that despite these state abortion bans, abortions
*  are somehow up nationwide, which seems very counterintuitive.
*  So just explain that.
*  Yeah, I mean, I have to admit that I was a little bit surprised when I saw these numbers.
*  I should say this is not a huge increase.
*  The estimate is that the number of abortions since the Supreme Court decision only went
*  up by like 0.2%.
*  But when you consider that there are all these states that banned abortion totally where
*  abortions went to zero, what it's really telling us is that the states where abortion
*  stayed legal increased by so much that they were able to sort of counterweight that reduction.
*  And I think there are a couple of factors that really explain what's going on here.
*  One is that we know that even though there's women who are prevented from having abortions
*  in the states that banned it, there are a lot of women that are still getting out, who
*  are still traveling to neighboring states.
*  And when you look at data on the number of abortions that are being provided around the
*  country, you can see really large increases in some of these border states that women
*  are tending to go to.
*  Places like Kansas, New Mexico, Illinois, North Carolina.
*  These are states that are neighboring places where abortion is banned.
*  And there's been a big growth in abortion infrastructure to accommodate those women
*  and they are traveling there and they are getting abortions.
*  But what's really interesting and I think more surprising in this data is that we also
*  see increases in states where they're just not that close to the places that banned abortion.
*  Like California has had a pretty substantial increase in the number of abortions that it's
*  provided and some of the states in the Northeast have had pretty big increases.
*  And I think that suggests that there's something more going on than just women traveling out
*  of the states with bans.
*  That actually there are more women in some of these states where abortion remained legal
*  who are having abortions in this post-Roe period than would have had them in the pre-Roe period.
*  And why would that be?
*  Why would there be more women having abortions in states where it was always legal after
*  Roe was overturned and it remained legal?
*  So I think the biggest reason is that right around the same time that the Supreme Court
*  overturned the Roe decision, the Biden administration changed the rules for how women can get abortion
*  pills in the United States.
*  So the abortion pill has been legal for 20 years, but for most of that time, if you wanted
*  to take abortion pills, you had to go to a physical clinic, meet with a doctor in person,
*  and then they would give you the pill in person and you would take the first pill at the visit
*  and then take additional medicine home with you.
*  And so that meant that medication abortion really wasn't that much easier for women than
*  procedural abortion because they still had to go to a clinic that might be pretty far
*  from their house.
*  And it was still pretty expensive.
*  What the new rules allow is that you can get abortions through telemedicine.
*  And with these telemedicine abortions, women could talk to a doctor from their home and
*  then have abortion pills mailed to their home and then they could take the abortion pills
*  at home.
*  That change made abortion less expensive in a lot of cases.
*  And it also made it much more convenient for women who didn't live near an abortion clinic.
*  You know, we were talking before about the driving distances.
*  And so, of course, if you live in Texas or Mississippi and there's no abortion clinic
*  within hundreds of miles, driving distance is really important.
*  But even in states where abortion had always been legal, and again, I think California
*  is a good example, you know, if you lived kind of in central California, you might be
*  pretty far from an abortion clinic before.
*  And so, this regulatory change, I think, made it a little easier for some of those
*  women to get abortions.
*  The other thing that happened is that once that policy went into place, there was actually
*  a big kind of startup movement.
*  They almost feel a little bit like tech startups in the abortion space now where they feel
*  like, okay, we can have some doctors who can work remotely and can provide abortions through
*  the internet to women.
*  And so, that's been like an increase in the number of providers that are available for
*  those women.
*  So, since Roe, the infrastructure for abortions that don't require going to a clinic expands
*  dramatically from what you're saying.
*  Yeah, but I think that's not the only thing that happened.
*  I think for a lot of people who had not been paying attention to abortion in recent years,
*  the overturning of Roe was like a huge activating moment.
*  We have seen in the last year a lot of fundraising and money being poured into the abortion system
*  and awareness of abortion and the options for abortion growing.
*  And we've also seen a lot of these states that always had legal abortion have started
*  pursuing new policies to make abortion even easier to get and less expensive.
*  States have required insurance companies to cover abortion.
*  They've provided extra legal protections for doctors that provide abortion.
*  They've allowed nurse practitioners and other kinds of people to provide abortions in their
*  states.
*  And I think all of that is sort of a political reaction to the Supreme Court decision.
*  And those changes might not have happened in the absence of it.
*  And all of those changes probably also helped make abortion a little bit more available
*  to women in those states and also probably raised their awareness that abortion was
*  an option for them.
*  So in these states, and this is counterintuitive, the overturning of Roe leads to greater access
*  to abortions, kind of a mirror image to the 13 states that banned it.
*  And therefore, according to this data, there are more abortions in these states.
*  That's right.
*  I mean, we don't know what's going to happen in the future and the trends could reverse.
*  But I actually think it's possible that we're going to see an even larger increase in the
*  number of abortions nationwide because all this data we've been talking about are a little
*  old.
*  The most recent data about the number of abortions comes from this summer.
*  But since then, there's been a pretty important change, which is that a bunch of these states
*  that kept abortion legal have passed laws that allow doctors there to mail abortion
*  pills into states with bans and they will protect them from extradition.
*  So if you're a doctor in New York in the first year in which Roe was overturned, you would
*  not want to treat a patient in Texas and you would not want to mail abortion pills into
*  Texas because abortion is illegal in Texas and authorities could come and arrest you
*  potentially.
*  And what New York and Massachusetts and a couple of other states have done is they've
*  passed laws where they said, no, no, if you go to Texas, you could get arrested.
*  As long as you stay here in your home state of New York, we will make sure that you're
*  not going to get in any legal trouble.
*  And as a result of that, there are doctors who are setting up shop and sending large
*  numbers of pills into these banned states.
*  And because of that, researchers I talked to think that we could see an even larger
*  number of abortions happening this year than we saw last year.
*  I mean, all this, Margot, suggests that while abortion bans have worked in the states where
*  they're in place during this first year post Roe, overall, the strategy of trying to
*  overturn Roe and therefore reduce abortion has kind of backfired.
*  Right. And it may continue to backfire more and more over time.
*  Yeah, I think it has backfired.
*  If you think about the activists that brought this case to the Supreme Court, their goal
*  was not just to reduce abortions in Texas and Mississippi.
*  They really wanted to reduce abortions across the entire country.
*  And I think we've all been really focused on the states that were banning abortion.
*  But there was also this huge change that happened in the states that didn't ban
*  abortion, which is a lot of states.
*  And I think that's why we see abortions going up by so much.
*  I don't know that the anti-abortion activists could have ever predicted that this would
*  be the effect of the end of Roe.
*  And I don't even think that the abortion rights activists saw this coming.
*  I think everyone assumed that the end of Roe was going to mean a decrease in
*  abortions, not an increase.
*  Well, Margo, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it. Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Tuesday, the fifth day of the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, Hamas released 12
*  more hostages from Gaza, including 10 Israelis and two Thai nationals, while Israel released
*  30 Palestinians from Israeli prisons.
*  Overall, Hamas has released 85 hostages since the ceasefire began and Israel has freed
*  180 imprisoned Palestinians.
*  And the powerful political network led by conservative billionaire Charles Koch has
*  endorsed former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley for president, the latest boost to her
*  Republican candidacy, which has steadily risen in the polls.
*  The endorsement gives Haley's campaign much needed organizational muscle and financial
*  might and cements her place as the favorite candidate of Republican donors seeking to
*  stop Donald Trump from becoming the nominee.
