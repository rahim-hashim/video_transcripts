*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernicee, and this is the daily.
*  When Hamas attacked Israel two weeks ago, they took 200 hostages back with them into the
*  Gaza Strip, including grandparents and children as young as nine months old.
*  It was one of the largest mass abductions in recent history.
*  Now, the fate of those hostages is at the center of a deepening crisis in the Middle East,
*  and a looming ground invasion in Gaza.
*  Today, a conversation with the mother of one of them.
*  It's Friday, October 20th.
*  I called Rachel Goldberg for the first time last Tuesday, three days after the attack on October 7th.
*  Hi. Hi, Rachel. How are you doing?
*  Well, are you a mother? I'm not.
*  Well, I'm sure you've had a mother. I have.
*  So you can imagine what she would be going through if something happened to you.
*  Yeah. So that's how I'm doing.
*  My name is Rachel Goldberg. I'm 53, and I am in Jerusalem.
*  So my son, Hirsch Goldberg-Polen, is currently missing. He's been missing since he attended the music festival
*  that was in the southern part of Israel. And he was there Saturday morning when the terrorist event
*  happened there. We received two text messages from him at 8-11, and that's the last that we've heard of him.
*  Can you tell me about your son? So Hirsch, well, he's the perfect son for me.
*  There's a lot of him that it's the good parts of me. He just turned 23 last week on October 3rd.
*  So he was born in Berkeley, and when he was going into second grade, our family moved to Jerusalem,
*  he's super bright, very curious, a voracious reader, and in love with travel. He's had wonderlust since he
*  was a little boy to the point where he would read atlases, and he'd get to the end, and he'd start over,
*  and get to the end and start over, and he would memorize every country in the world,
*  along with every capital, population, elevation, just obsessed with travel. So for his bar mitzvah,
*  he asked for only atlases, globes, and maps. Wow. And the other thing he's passionate about is
*  music festivals, specifically. And I think he just felt like he was going to have fun music festival
*  here, and in the worst way anybody could imagine. So Friday night, we had this nice meal with our
*  family friends, and we kissed him goodbye, and he was in a great mood, and we had had a great time,
*  and that's the last time we saw him, and he and honor Shapira, his best friend met up, and they
*  went down south where this festival was, and both of them are uncounted for. And did you hear from him
*  once he got there? What was the next thing that happened, Rachel? No, the next thing that happened,
*  so on the Jewish Sabbath, I actually don't use my phone. And so he left, and the next morning,
*  my husband had left for synagogue at 730 in the morning, and I was sitting having a cup of tea,
*  and sometimes close to eight, we heard bomb sirens going off in Jerusalem, so I quickly came downstairs
*  and woke up both of my daughters who were still sleeping, so that we could get into our bomb shelter,
*  which we have in our apartment. So we went into our bomb shelter, and then we waited for the
*  all clear, you wait 10 minutes, and if nothing else happens, you can come out. And even though I'm not,
*  you know, I don't use my phone on Shabbat, in cases of emergency, of course you use your phone,
*  and I thought, well, my son is somewhere, and I don't know where, and I'm turning on my phone to make
*  sure he's okay. And when I turned on my phone to text him in, both at 811, and the first text said,
*  I love you, and the second text said, I'm sorry. And immediately I knew something terrible happened,
*  because first of all, he would never just randomly write at 811 in the morning, I love you,
*  and the I'm sorry, immediately to me, I know him, and he knows me so well, and my interpretation
*  instantly was, I'm sorry, because whatever is happening is going to cause you tremendous pain
*  and tremendous worry. That was my first thought. And as it turns out, he was right.
*  God, Rachel. Yeah. Immediately I called him, and rang and rang and rang and he didn't answer.
*  So I wrote a text, are you okay? And he didn't answer. And five minutes later I said,
*  let me know you're okay. And then 10 minutes later I wrote, I'm leaving my phone on,
*  let me know you okay. And but those were three unanswered, they haven't been answered. So we started,
*  one of my daughters, the older daughter and I started to feverishly try to figure out,
*  you know, where exactly was he sending this from? And my daughter sent me a video that had been
*  going around from this music festival with people screaming and you can shoot and she said,
*  is this the festival he's at? Like is this where he is? And the truth is I didn't know. So I took a
*  screenshot of that and I sent it to their other friend and I asked, I said, the position on her
*  here and he wrote back yes. So I immediately knew they were there and we started watching news and
*  then all of a sudden it was pandemonium everywhere. I mean, complete massacres taking place in all
*  these different key boots that are right on the border. I mean, it was complete. It was warm.
*  And so we were frantic and we were in a panic, but his friend had already needed a missing
*  poster that was of her son honor and saying they wrote the thing, you have any information,
*  did you see them? And he had already posted that on all these social media places that I as it's
*  be real, no, there's nothing about. So it was very, very helpful that Yani's third friend
*  was doing this and it was through that that a few hours later, probably around noon, that we
*  got a picture from inside of a bomb shelter. And we could see on the side sort of midway
*  on the left side we could see her in profile and where the door was and it's just a normal sized
*  door we could see honor. And first we were like, oh my gosh, thank God, because these means they weren't
*  killed at the festival because we already had heard there were scores, if not hundreds of people,
*  we now know it's close to 300 people who killed at this festival. And what we now understand
*  from eyewitnesses that we ended up talking to is that hersht and honor and another boy named
*  you ad and they had driven down together and they got in the car to drive away and then the siren
*  started going off which meant there were important coming rockets from Gaza and when rockets are falling
*  and you get off the road and you get into the shelter. So they had stopped the car to get into the
*  shelter and there were you know five other girls that also cooled over and it was also people from
*  the music festival they all ran together they weren't friends but I mean they had all just been
*  at this event together. So at first we were so happy that we were like, oh that's wonderful,
*  they're in a bomb shelter, they're safe and in the picture they don't look panicked. Like there's
*  people, sun glasses on their heads and someone's looking at their phone, they don't look like they're
*  in panic, they look like there is really young people who are hanging out in a bomb shelter because
*  yeah yeah maybe there's like some sort of siren going off because maybe something's happening
*  outside. But then we realized when was this taken and why haven't we lived from him and we were
*  making up all sorts of excuses. Oh it's almost have died or when they were running away he dropped
*  his phone so that's why he didn't answer me. What we subsequently found out is that around
*  830 the terrorists came to the door of the bomb shelter and apparently started throwing grenades,
*  hand grenades into the shelter which is like fish and a barrel. You know there's 30 people smashed
*  in there. Apparently I don't know I think someone told me that's something you know you usually
*  have 10 to 15 people in them. So you had this massive pack group of people and on air was
*  posted to the door. He apparently from all accounts was the complete hero.
*  He quickly has you only from the time of pin on a grenade is called your 4.5 seconds until it
*  explodes and he was picking them up and throwing them back and they were spraying machine gun fire
*  into there. So it was crazy and horrible and we know now is many of those young people were killed
*  many more severely extremely wounded and a few were wounded but you know not horribly and some of
*  them pretended to be dead and what we did get eyewitness accounts of is that her chest arm
*  below the elbow was blown off and I think he must have been in complete shock because we heard
*  that he made a turn a kit. He didn't cry out. He didn't lose consciousness.
*  Then the terrorists came in and at gunpoint said everyone who can stand up stand up and walk out
*  and six of them walked out including her. It was for young men and two young women.
*  They were put on a pickup truck and they were driven off by these terrorists and that was around
*  nine o'clock and the police actually let us know that the last time that her phone was you know
*  how they can trace phones where they were last seen was on the border with Gaza.
*  Now we have no proof that you know maybe someone stole his phone maybe you know it doesn't
*  necessarily mean anything. The assumption is that they are all all six of those kids are kidnapped
*  and none of the parents that we've spoken to of those six kids we none of us have had any sort of
*  word from our children. Sadly we do have there was a girl who played dead who was next to her and
*  there was a young man who shared a lot of information and there was another young woman who was
*  much more able to share with us the girl who was right next to her. She's so horribly traumatized
*  that it's even hard for her still today she can't really speak. So we don't have confirmation
*  you know a lot because there's such a pandemonium still here so that's you know where we are
*  and what we want now is first of all we want to really make sure that her shaz his arm tended to
*  he really needs medical treatment immediately urgently and obviously what we really want is
*  I want him to be sitting next to me right now. So you're basically just waiting patiently for now.
*  Yeah I mean you know making noise we're making noise because at this point we feel like
*  you know there was a decision in the beginning in those first 48 hours when we could hardly function
*  because it was you know so shocking and new and press was calling and I was like why would we go to
*  the press like we need to get our son back why are we going to press let's talk to the police let's
*  talk to the you know the government and then what we heard that his arm was blown off and we realized
*  he's probably bleeding to death so you know what let's talk to everybody and that's still where we are
*  because you know no matter how this ends we need to know that we ran to the end the earth for him.
*  Rachel thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us today I know this is
*  really painful for you and I really appreciate you taking the time to help us understand just what
*  happened yeah thanks a lot Sabrina take care bye bye
*  after the break I call Rachel back to find out what she's learned about her son
*  we'll be right back
*  hello Rachel hi it's Sabrina from the daily hi how are you I'm okay how are you
*  you city yeah yeah that's my new answer it's shorter where am I catching you right now
*  I am just walking downstairs so that I can hear you without you know the whole team upstairs working
*  who's the team the team is this like wonderful group of people who from Saturday
*  October 7th have been here working to help find hers and find strategists to figure out ideas and
*  how to get you know the word out around the world that this thing happened so we work about 20 hours a
*  day and sleep is for the week Rachel I'm talking to you on Thursday evening catch me up on what they've
*  been able to piece together we talked shortly after her sh was taken what surfaced since the last
*  time we spoke um actually there's a couple things the first thing is that we got a more specific
*  time on his phone and location it it was deeper in Gaza we had been told it was on the border
*  was actually in Gaza and the first signal from within Gaza was at 10 25 so he got there earlier
*  than we had thought I don't know what that tells us but it just new information the other thing
*  that I thought was really interesting is that the young woman who was next to her she was able to
*  come to my house and actually talk to me and she told us something that we hadn't known which was
*  that when everyone was running into this bomb shelter that there was also a beddewin man who I
*  guess we think he was a guard for the field to cross the road at the keyboards across the road
*  this beddewin man ran in with them and as Hamas was coming closer and they could hear them screaming
*  and shouting he said to the kids inside stay in here don't make any noise and he went outside and
*  in Arabic he said to them like hello how are you salam alaykum or something and he said oh don't
*  we're all Muslim here it's just my family we're hiding from the rockets but we're all Muslim
*  he was trying to save them and they beat him they may have killed him she didn't know you know she
*  just knew she could hear them beating him but there was something about that story that made me so
*  happy why did that make you happy because it's humanity being humane you know this is this problem
*  we have right it's us versus them or it's black and white or whatever it is it's not he could have
*  come out and said I'm a Muslim they're Jews in there right but he didn't I mean I hope he's
*  alive but just the fact that like this man tried to save them and may have paid with his life we
*  don't know it just gave me hope that maybe there's still you know a shred of you know hope in the world
*  that people will do the right thing even when it's scary what do you know about some of the other
*  people herch was with that day you mentioned someone named honor oh honor beautiful honor
*  we buried honor on Friday they identified his body and we know for a fact and his parents know as
*  well that the eight kids who are now home are home because of honor the woman who came the other
*  day to tell the story about the Muslim man she also said we were counting the grenades hand grenades
*  as they were throwing them in and she said and he threw eight out she said but three got in and she
*  said the damage that three did she said even if four had come in no one would have walked out of
*  their life and you know we had stood in the back we didn't want to take away from this boy's funeral
*  but we felt we needed to pay our respects so we came and we went toward the back we didn't sit you
*  know up where everybody else was but when the funeral was over we wanted to go by and just
*  extend our condolences just to the mom and dad to let them know that we were there and as we got
*  closer to them his mom had just swooned and they had gotten her a chair and there was a medic
*  trying to like give her some sort of oxygen or something and then the father saw us coming and he
*  said to her it's hers his parents and she jumped out of her chair and the four of us were hugging
*  and sobbing you know in Israel we're not afraid to let it out like there's no holding back and we
*  were sobbing and sobbing and everyone around us was screaming out you know it wasn't this like
*  demure tears and she started screaming out he's coming home he's coming home and she screamed
*  to everybody everyone has to pray for her to come home and part of it is that you know she loves
*  and hers and she wants her to come home and part of it is that she has to feel like
*  on her saved another life the only condolence the only comfort that she can get is that these people
*  walked out because of what he did so that was an awful funeral to attend and also to see all of
*  these graves of these young people all of them you know it looks like beds like it just was like
*  heaps heaps of dirt and flowers on all these heaps of dirt and fresh dirt and it was just
*  sickening
*  what did it feel like to come home after the funeral Rachel was any part of you worried that
*  you could be in those shoes as well oh there's not been one day I don't think there's been one
*  hour that I haven't thought he's dead you know like we have to keep going forward
*  until we know that's not true but her story of died 13 days ago and I don't know about it
*  he may have died an hour ago like he may have died five days ago he may have died on my birthday
*  last week I don't know right so it's really it's just a twilight zone of an existence that
*  is so unfamiliar it's like walking on another planet what is that planet it's like living in a
*  completely parallel universe because I feel so close in proximity to this place I knew
*  you know and I see these people and these friends and I'm you know hugging people and I'm very very
*  close to them and I can smell them and I can see their pores and their skin but I'm different I'm
*  there's like a film between us because I'm not in their world like I'm super close but I'm not
*  in their world and the only time that I feel that I'm in a world that's familiar to me is when
*  I'm with you know last night I went to an event that a few different families of American
*  hostages were meeting at and when I'm with those people we all know that parallel universe we're all
*  in that place and this one woman and I every time we see each other we hug each other and we
*  feel such a closeness which is this like sick grotesque perverse closeness but it's that we're both
*  in this same devastating and unknown and unfamiliar universe. Rachel has these really government
*  been helpful to you has it met with you and other loved ones of hostages what's it been doing?
*  They have assigned us two different people to be resources for us and they've been checking in
*  each day but I think right now you know it's a very emotional time in the country and I don't know
*  you know you just have to kind of keep busy keep trying to do whatever you can do to save the
*  person you're trying to save and keep going forward. Do you feel satisfied with their help?
*  I do in that I don't know what they could do. Rachel since we last talked
*  Israel has taken steps to retaliate against Hamas you know it's stepped up air strikes on Gaza
*  and there've been civilian casualties knowing how much your son and you and thousands of other
*  families have suffered because of this Hamas attack. How are you viewing the retaliation on Gaza
*  and what the government of Israel is doing right now? You know is it the right thing to do
*  knowing that there might be so many civilian casualties knowing that your son is there. How are
*  you seeing this? Right I mean I know that there are plenty of innocent civilians in Gaza. I know that
*  the people who were killed on October 7th also were innocent civilians and I understand that
*  Israel is saying we can't allow that to ever happen again and I am hopeful that the innocent people
*  and I'm not talking only about the you know hostages but there are innocent you know two million
*  Palestinian people who are not in Hamas who are also trapped in Gaza and I hope that it's
*  to a minimum the the agony and suffering is kept to a minimum but Israel has got to defend itself.
*  Rachel on the point of civilian casualties in Gaza I spoke to a 23 year old in Gaza over the weekend
*  who was very worried about being killed in the air strikes and and it struck me he was about
*  herchus age and I wonder as a mother how you see the civilian casualties in Gaza is that upsetting to
*  you is that something that comes into your mind? How do you where do you think that? It does it
*  absolutely does and what I would say to that 23 year old if he's listening now is try to go find
*  herch let him use your phone and let's get you both out of there because I care for anyone who is
*  an innocent civilian who swept up and being held hostage and it might be the Palestinian
*  Gaza kid that you spoke to. Rachel this is maybe kind of a painful question but I wanted to ask it
*  Hamas is committed to the destruction of the state of Israel you know it's non-negotiable to them
*  right what would you want Hamas if I may ask it like this what would you want Hamas to understand
*  about you as a Jewish person as an Israeli in this moment what do you want them to understand
*  about who you are? Well I'm not really sure that there's anything that I want them to understand
*  about what I am I would really like to understand more about who they are. I want to understand
*  them more now if the understanding is they're saying I want you dead it's very hard for me to meet
*  them halfway on that obviously there's a tremendous amount of pain and agony behind a group of
*  people who want the destruction completely of another people you know and I'm not sure how you
*  work through that or how you try to talk to that so I don't know that there's anything that I can
*  really you know say to Hamas I don't think Hamas is any interest in hearing anything I have to say
*  but I am really interested in hearing what they have to say I really am. And what would you want
*  to understand about them Rachel you mentioned the pain and the agony potentially somewhere behind
*  everything what would you want to know? Well I just want to know like what first of all what's this
*  method how does the world become sympathetic when you have elderly women and nine month old babies
*  with you like I want I want to understand I really want them to say to me like what is it exactly
*  that they want to happen is it simply that they don't want any Jews living in Israel is it that
*  they don't want any Jews living you know like I want to really understand what's what's the goal
*  and what you know are there options I don't get it I would like to get it. Rachel to the point of
*  you being curious and wanting to listen you know there's a very emotional debate playing out
*  in Israel and here in the United States as well about history and context and in this attack
*  and I think to many people you know it's kind of an outrageous thing to even think about people feel
*  you know that atrocity can never be explained and somehow you know bringing in the context is
*  offensive to people but I guess I'm wondering how how you think about it you know you're in the
*  middle of this in such a personal way do you see there being context here that is important to
*  understand how do you see that well this idea that that anyone could be standing up to try to justify
*  what was happening in these key boots is that were in any way if you're trying to justify that
*  you have to honestly say to yourself you know maybe I need to take my compass and to be fixed because
*  you can't you cannot if people are truly okay or saying well they deserved it because
*  then we then we have big big problems big big problems as as the human race and when I see
*  footage of Palestinian children getting killed I am crying I am not saying they deserve that never
*  never in my life have I said that and I pray to God never in my life will I say that and so when I
*  hear people saying that it's concerning we're in a we're in a frightening place and I would I would
*  love for to see some light on the horizon but right now at least where I am it's very very dark
*  and I'm just you know running out of time and hoping that I I will see my son again alive
*  we're looking for a teeny tiny molecule in a universe of haystacks and that molecule is named
*  your skull bertholome and I want him home with me
*  Rachel thank you so much thank you
*  on Thursday night during a rare address from the Oval Office in which he urged Congress to pass
*  an aid package for Ukraine and for Israel president Biden spoke about the hostages in Gaza
*  as I told the families of Americans being held captive by a mosque we're pursuing every avenue
*  to bring their loved ones home as president there is no higher priority for me than the safety of
*  American cell hostage
*  in all 13 Americans went missing in the October 7th attack it is not clear how many of those are in
*  captivity in Gaza we'll be right back
*  here's what you should know today house Republicans unable to elect a speaker for 16 straight days
*  engaged in bitter infighting on Thursday about how to move forward during an emotional private meeting
*  they rejected a plan to empower an interim speaker to lead the chamber until the end of the year
*  that left them with few options the Republican nominee for speaker representative Jim Jordan
*  of Ohio has failed to win two rounds of voting and appears unlikely to win in a third round
*  nevertheless Jordan said that he would push for another vote and Sydney Powell a prominent member
*  of Donald Trump's legal team pleaded guilty on Thursday to trying to overturn Trump's 2020
*  election loss in Georgia the guilty plea which allows Powell to avoid jail time and a criminal trial
*  requires her to testify against her co-defendants in the case including potentially Trump himself
