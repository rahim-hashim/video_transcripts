# Biden Supports Israel. Does the Rest of America?

*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Barrow.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, in a major new poll, the Times tries to understand how Americans really feel about
*  the war in Gaza.
*  President Biden's role in the conflict and perhaps most revealingly about the state of
*  Israel itself.
*  My colleague Jonathan Weissman explains.
*  It's Friday, December 22.
*  Jonathan, the war between Israel and Hamas has become, and I'm not telling you anything
*  you don't already know, a source of profound division in the United States.
*  You can see that from the protests on college campuses and in big cities, from the strong
*  emotions that are pouring forth on social media and from the political conversation in
*  Washington.
*  And yet it's been very hard to actually measure any of it.
*  But the Times has now tried to do just that.
*  That's right.
*  We went out to try to ascertain where Americans as a whole are.
*  And we talked to Red Dishra voters and we asked them two sets of questions.
*  One about how President Biden is handling this conflict.
*  And the other about Israel itself and Israel's handling of its war against Hamas in Gaza.
*  Okay.
*  Well, let's start with what the poll found when it comes to the first of those two areas
*  of questions, how American see President Biden's handling of the war?
*  I mean, registered voters clearly disapprove of the way President Biden has been handling
*  this conflict.
*  57% say they disapprove and only 33% said they approved of the way the President has
*  been handling the war in Gaza.
*  So what exactly does this poll reveal about what's behind those high disapproval numbers?
*  On the one hand, those numbers are striking because Israel is historically such a close
*  ally of the US and Biden has been so unwaveringly supportive of it.
*  On the other hand, it's perhaps not that surprising at all because of how much anger Israel's
*  retaliation for October 7th, the extremely high death toll on Gaza has inspired among
*  Americans.
*  Well, the signals being sent to President Biden are decidedly mixed.
*  You have 44% saying in the war now, regardless of whether the hostages have been released
*  or not, but nearly the same number, 39% saying no, they want Israel to keep pressing their
*  war on Hamas until either all of the hostages are out or Hamas has been destroyed.
*  So that shows a real split in where Americans actually are.
*  How do you make sense of that?
*  Because those do seem like confusing signals, a majority disapproving of the President's
*  handling, but then a pretty even split between what they want him to actually do that signals
*  how he might get out of their disapproval.
*  It's tricky because that 57% that disapprove of the way Biden is handling it is divided
*  itself.
*  Some of those people say Biden has been too pro-Israel and some other people think that Biden
*  is too supportive of the Palestinians and maybe not being tough enough on Hamas.
*  Okay, so how does this broad disapproval and this more or less even split among voters
*  over what they want Biden to do?
*  How does it break down by party?
*  Well, let's look at Republicans.
*  93% of Republicans disapprove broadly of the way President Biden is doing his job, but
*  78% disapprove of the way Biden is handling the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
*  Huh.
*  So as you see, there is a drop off.
*  Right.
*  More approve of his action toward Israel than approve of him in general.
*  Why is that?
*  Well, among Republicans, Israel is just a more popular political entity.
*  So if Joe Biden is broadly perceived as being pro-Israel, a certain number of Republicans
*  will give him credit for that.
*  Right.
*  Okay.
*  So what about Democrats and their views of how he's handling the war?
*  It's kind of the converse.
*  I mean, the fact is Biden has pretty much consolidated support among Democrats.
*  Eight out of ten Democrats support the way President Biden is handling his job.
*  But on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, just over half approve of the way he's handling
*  it.
*  That's a very big gap.
*  Yes.
*  As Biden's approach to the war is pulling slightly better with Republicans than he's
*  pulling with them overall.
*  With Democrats, he's pulling worse on his approach to the war than he's pulling with
*  Democrats overall, which is really fascinating.
*  Basically he has disillusioned his own party with the way he has handled the conflict.
*  That's right.
*  That's in part a reflection of the generation gap within the Democratic Party, Democrat
*  Sku young and young people really, really feel badly about the way this war is being handled
*  and about the conduct that Israel is engaging in in Gaza.
*  But I say more about that.
*  It feels very important to understanding this poll.
*  Remember, in July, when the Times last pulled voters on how they're feeling, these young
*  voters between the ages of 18 and 29 sided with Joe Biden over Donald Trump by 10 percentage
*  points.
*  Now this young demographic is siding with Trump by six percentage points.
*  That's a huge flip.
*  Okay, Jonathan, does the poll allow you to truly attribute that phenomenon of young voters
*  essentially starting to flee Biden and to some extent flipping over to Trump, which
*  is not entirely intuitive to the war?
*  Because we know from past polling that Biden was losing support with young people, so that
*  was already kind of a trajectory.
*  So how should we think about that?
*  It's very difficult to tease out all of the factors.
*  And when you look at the poll overall, if you ask people what their dominant concerns
*  are, it's still the economics.
*  And their impression of the economy is certainly coloring their views of President Biden.
*  The economic picture is actually improving, but between July and now, we've had the October
*  7th attack by Hamas on Israelis and the ensuing war.
*  So you have these two factors playing at the same time.
*  And it seems to me that the war in Gaza is just a millstone around Biden's neck, preventing
*  a comeback among those younger voters.
*  Right.
*  Something very big changed since July, and it wasn't, as you're saying, really the economy,
*  it was a war in Gaza that President Biden has articulated pretty much unwavering moral
*  support for it.
*  But what about older voters?
*  I'm going to deduce because you haven't said that older voters like younger voters are
*  turning on Biden over this war that they're not.
*  And that's a pretty important group of voters for Biden.
*  Traditionally, 65 and up is the voting block that votes most, that is consistently at the
*  polls.
*  And for those people, 52% approve of the way Biden is handling the conflict against 40%
*  who disapprove.
*  Those aren't huge numbers, but if you look at all the age brackets, that's pretty remarkable
*  considering 30% approve among Jann X voters, 26 approve among 30 to 44 year olds, millennials,
*  and only 20% approve of Biden's handling of the conflict among 18 to 29 year olds, 20%.
*  So if you're Joe Biden and you're thinking, well, what am I supposed to do?
*  You could look at that 52% and say, well, those guys vote.
*  Should I change course and alienate 65 year olds and up who like what I'm doing?
*  It's a tough decision for the President.
*  Right.
*  Because there's a bit of a damned if you do, damned if you don't.
*  If the President were to be highly responsive to young voters who have soured on his handling
*  of the war, he risks alienating older voters who haven't.
*  So there's no blindingly obvious course of action for President Biden in terms of public
*  opinion and turning it around.
*  And so perhaps Biden's most logical answer is to do what it seems he has been doing since
*  October 7th, which is to kind of follow his instinct, even if that ends up alienating
*  some young voters.
*  There's no real evidence at all that President Biden is shaping his policy according to politics
*  or the will of the people.
*  Right.
*  And given the damned if you do, damned if you don't message from this poll for President
*  Biden, we know that this war is going to wind down.
*  For no other reason than the United States wants it to wind down.
*  So as a long term political conundrum, he can wait it out.
*  The real message that we learned from this poll has more to do with how Americans view
*  Israel and their country's relationship with it and what that means for the Jewish state
*  in the long run.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Okay.
*  Jonathan, what exactly does this poll tell us about how Americans view Israel and America's
*  relationship to Israel?
*  You mentioned before the break that the real meaning of this poll is not how Americans
*  think of Biden in this moment, but how they think of Israel.
*  So describe what the poll actually found.
*  Now if you look overall, Americans do have positive feelings about Israel.
*  They are more sympathetic to the Israelis than the Palestinians.
*  And in general, they want America to side with Israel, to supply Israel with arms and
*  aid.
*  But when you look at young voters, the change is dramatic.
*  Very few of them believe Israel is serious about peace with the Palestinians.
*  Nearly half say Israel is intentionally killing civilians.
*  That is a bad sign.
*  I mean, that's a bad thing to do.
*  And nearly three quarters say Israel is not taking enough precautions to avoid civilian
*  casualties.
*  A majority of those young voters actually oppose additional and economic military aid.
*  That portends a huge shift in America's relationship with Israel.
*  Right.
*  And so what you're left with is a very clear understanding that this younger group of
*  Americans, I mean, in a sense America's future is very skeptical of Israel.
*  And maybe skeptical isn't even the right word for it.
*  Not strong enough word for it based on what you just said.
*  They disapprove of its conduct.
*  Yes.
*  And what's remarkable is that there is a linear progression of this ill will coming as you
*  go down from the older generations to the youngest generations.
*  We'll just explain that the concept of a linear progression here.
*  So if you're from the silent generation like Joe Biden, you're over 70, 80 years old,
*  that means you were alive during the Holocaust and the founding of Israel.
*  You maybe know people who lived through those defining moments.
*  And you're more likely to have a strong feeling about the need for Israel and the US to support
*  it.
*  The United States was the first nation in the world to recognize Israel as a sovereign
*  country in 1948.
*  The baby boom generation might not have been old enough to remember the establishment
*  of the Israeli state, but they do remember 1967 and the Six Day War in which Israel
*  fended off attacks from all of its Arab neighbors and looked heroic.
*  They remembered the 1973 war, the Yom Kippur War, when a sneak attack nearly destroyed
*  Israel.
*  And at that time, America's support for Israel was unquestioned and copious.
*  That's when you started seeing year after year, Congress without question allocating more
*  aid to Israel than any country in the world.
*  And X may not have seen those wars, but they saw a peace process.
*  They saw Israeli governments vacillate between liberal and conservative and Israelis seemed
*  serious about reaching some kind of peace accord with their Arab neighbors and with the Palestinians
*  that would lead to two nations side by side reaching some kind of settlement.
*  And what does that do for the view of generation X toward Israel?
*  So generation X might not have as monolithic support as much older generations, but generation
*  X members still tend to favor Israelis over Palestinians.
*  57% in our poll said they are more sympathetic to the Israelis than the Palestinians in the
*  current conflict.
*  So for this generation, you remember Bill Clinton shuddling between the United States
*  from Washington to Tel Aviv.
*  You remember the Oslo Accords and for an American president, peace between Israel and Palestine
*  is kind of the brass ring, the thing that you want the most.
*  Right.
*  Okay.
*  So what's next?
*  Then we move on to millennials.
*  Millennials remember, of course, 9-11.
*  And a sense that the Middle East is a divisive place, a place where Americans are fighting.
*  There is a division in Americans about whether or not our troops, our money and resources
*  should even be dumping into this area.
*  And millennials don't remember a peace process.
*  What they remember is the rise of the right in Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu becoming a fixture
*  of Israeli politics and bluntly declaring that he doesn't want a two-state solution.
*  He doesn't want peace with the Palestinians.
*  Their sense, millennial sense, is that he wants to crush them.
*  Right.
*  And so here we see an important turning point in that linear progression you described just
*  a couple of moments ago, millennial Americans have a profoundly different experience of Israel
*  with their own eyes than the silent generation who watched Israel be born or the baby boomer
*  generation that watched this little country that could and somehow overcome its bigger
*  Arab rivals, armies.
*  This feels like a very important moment.
*  It is.
*  And we see it in the numbers.
*  If you look at our poll, the ages between 30 and 44, only 36% say that they are more sympathetic
*  toward Israel than the Palestinians in the current conflict.
*  36%.
*  That is a linear decline from the older generations.
*  And that leads us to the current generation, the 18 to 29 year olds.
*  With the 18 to 29 year olds, only 27% said they sympathized with Israelis.
*  46% said they sympathized with the Palestinians.
*  This is the first generation in which that split is so decisive in the Palestinians favor.
*  They don't remember peace processes.
*  They only remember an Israel that is powerful, that is not interested in peace with the Palestinians.
*  They see a bullying superpower in the Middle East and they don't like it.
*  So what a meaningful number of this generation, generation Z, how they see Israel is less
*  and less as a victim as previous generations did.
*  And instead increasingly see Israel as a victimizer.
*  That's right.
*  And they look at what's happening in Washington with their government and they see US military
*  aid to Israel as increasingly important and increasingly identifiable.
*  For instance, if you look at Iron Dome, this missile defense system in Israel, it's built
*  and engineered with help from the United States.
*  The missiles that shoot down missiles being fired at Israel, especially from Hamas, parts
*  of those missiles are made in America.
*  There is a sense that America is deeply entrenched in Israel.
*  And Israel is not a nation that these youngest voters sympathize with.
*  And now you're starting to see mainstream Democrats, not from the fringe left, but the
*  center of the party, at least talking about attaching conditions to military aid to Israel.
*  Such conditions are routine with other countries.
*  I mean, we've been attaching conditions to aid to Pakistan for decades.
*  But with Israel, that support has always been unconditional.
*  This is a very big change for US Israel relations.
*  And just to bring it back to the poll, Jonathan, each generation's experience seems to be
*  projected onto this moment.
*  And that's how you get this linear progression decline of American support for Israel.
*  That's right.
*  The six are personal.
*  And the way somebody, some voter experiences history will impact his or her feelings about
*  political issues.
*  And ultimately, aid to Israel is a political issue.
*  And I think we can project forward only so much.
*  I mean, the fact is that somebody who's 25 years old may feel differently in the future.
*  But the numbers are so dramatic.
*  When you see only 27% of this age cohort sympathizing with Israel, you have to think that there
*  will be residual impacts as these people grow into the power structure of the United States.
*  Right.
*  And the natural conclusion of everything you have just described in this poll is that when
*  they are running the country, they will bring a fair amount of skepticism toward Israel.
*  And so the question becomes, is Israel prepared to live in a world where US support is meaningfully
*  lower, where strings and conditions are attached, or even in a world where it doesn't really
*  have much US support?
*  Or if it's not willing to live in that world, will it do we think make it a priority to
*  appeal to these younger Americans in order to maintain US support going forward?
*  I think this is a huge question for Israel.
*  You know, there are voices in Israel that very much want to go it alone, that say, we will
*  do what we need to do to survive.
*  And we don't care what the international community says.
*  Those people were already willing to challenge or actually thumb their nose at America.
*  And remember Netanyahu at one time went around Barack Obama's back and addressed Congress
*  at the invitation of Republicans.
*  He was willing to have ruptures in the US Israel support system.
*  Right.
*  It is very possible that Netanyahu was willing to do what he did to Obama because on some
*  level, he believed, and he has a lot of reason to believe it, that the United States would
*  never really punish him or Israel for that defiant and insulting act to Obama because
*  its commitment is so deep.
*  Right.
*  And that was a long time ago.
*  You know, if we look at generation to generation, we see how events that that generation lived
*  through really impacted that generation's view of US Israel relations.
*  Well, young voters of today had already started souring on an Israel led by Benjamin Netanyahu.
*  And now this generation now has its seminal event.
*  And that seminal event, the war in Gaza, is not creating an impression to turn that erosion
*  around.
*  I want to try to end this conversation by bringing all of this together.
*  How Americans are viewing Biden's handling of the war, the first half of our conversation.
*  And this second half, how they are viewing Israel, the current dynamic of a US president
*  who is as supportive of Israel as Biden is.
*  And what Israel's current government is doing and how it approaches this war and the
*  world, this right-wing government, when you put those together, it suggests that the
*  disillusionment of young Americans is quite likely to deepen and that it will very likely
*  accelerate what could become a deeply strained dynamic between the United States and Israel.
*  That's possible.
*  And that's one way to look at it.
*  But remember, before the Hamas attacks on Israel, Israel itself was deeply divided.
*  Hundreds of thousands of Israelis were in the streets calling for Netanyahu to step down
*  or to change course.
*  And now 76% of Israelis disapprove of the job Netanyahu is doing.
*  They want him gone.
*  So there could be a major, major shift coming out of this war in Israel itself that might
*  rejuvenate a sense of Israel as a thriving democracy that could seek some solution between
*  the Israelis and the Palestinians after this horrible, horrible war.
*  And basically, you're saying that what we're not accounting for in this moment is the
*  kind of profound internal change in Israel that might result from this war.
*  And from perhaps the removal of the Netanyahu government, which seems very possible, what
*  you just laid out, and that successor government with a new set of incentives and priorities
*  might, as you said, might change the way that younger Americans see Israel.
*  Israel is a young and dynamic democracy.
*  It certainly has its flaws.
*  Some people might even say those flaws are so profound that it isn't a democracy.
*  But Israel has found its way forward when it faced existential questions.
*  But when this war ends, Israel understands that this kind of bloodletting on both sides,
*  in which according to officials on each side, about 20,000 Palestinians have lost their
*  lives, and at least 1,200 Israelis have lost their lives.
*  This cannot be the new norm.
*  And for the United States, the US also has to recalibrate its approach to Israel that
*  is perhaps more complicated than the unquestioned support that we've seen for decades now.
*  Well Jonathan, thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need, ten other day.
*  On Thursday, a gunman killed at least 15 people in and around the Czech Republic capital
*  of Prague in one of the worst mass killings in Europe in nearly a decade.
*  Most of the victims were killed on the campus of Charles University in Central Prague.
*  Police said that the shooter is now dead, but offered no motive for his actions.
*  Rudy Giuliani filed for bankruptcy on Thursday after a judge ordered him to begin paying nearly
*  $150 million in damages to two former Georgia election workers for spreading lies that they
*  had tried to steal the 2020 election from Donald Trump.
*  Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, was found liable in August for defaming the
*  two workers when he baselessly claimed that they tried to manipulate ballots in Fulton County.
