*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverny-Sea, and this is the Daily.
*  After months of worry about a possible recession, it is now looking increasingly likely that
*  the U.S. has managed to avoid one.
*  Today, I talked to my colleague Jim Tangerzly about that brighter economic picture, and about
*  why, at least so far, Americans aren't giving President Biden much credit for it.
*  It's Monday, August 7.
*  So Jim, we've talked a bunch on the show about the economy and about how the government's
*  been trying to threaten needle, right?
*  Including inflation, while avoiding sending the economy into a recession on the other.
*  And when we had you on the show last year, you talked about this, and you said there were
*  two potential outcomes.
*  One was the U.S. would experience a soft landing, which, as the name suggests, is kind of
*  pillowy and painless, or the U.S. would experience a hard landing, which is a recession, with
*  lots of job loss and pain.
*  Where are we today in the government's threading of that needle?
*  Well, I think let's be really direct about it.
*  We are in the midst of some of the best economic data, if not the best economic data, of Joe
*  Biden's presidency.
*  And those data are giving a lot of economists and forecasters more and more confidence that
*  they might pull this soft landing thing off, that it just might come to pass that the economy
*  is able to make it out of high inflation without falling back into a recession, and do so
*  in a way that really starts to deliver the kinds of outcomes for workers that President
*  Biden's been wanting to do all along.
*  So tell us about that data.
*  What do you see in it?
*  We're seeing a bunch of things that are encouraging.
*  The first is on growth.
*  The economy keeps growing and adding jobs faster than economists predicted.
*  So in the second quarter of this year, the economy expanded at a 2.4% annual rate.
*  That was way better than most economists thought it would be.
*  At the same time, the job market just continues to turn on.
*  Month after month, we are seeing hundreds of thousands of jobs being added to the economy,
*  despite the fact that forecasters keep waiting for that to slow down.
*  Despite the fact that President Biden himself has been waiting for that to slow down, it
*  is slowing down, but very gradually, and that growth, the combination of job growth and
*  economic growth, is really powering the economy forward.
*  At the same time, and I think this is the most encouraging thing to people who are out
*  shopping right now, or if you're the President, to his advisors, is the fact that inflation
*  is coming down.
*  A year ago, we had like 7% annual inflation by one measure, and now it's 3%.
*  This is way better than I think a lot of economists thought we could pull off with those continued
*  growth rates that I mentioned.
*  One more really important thing, really great sign for the economy is that people's standard
*  of living is starting to improve in a way that it had in the first couple of years of
*  the Biden presidency.
*  Hourly wages rose faster than prices did in the spring for the first time in two years,
*  which just means people have more money to spend.
*  Their incomes are actually going up even in inflation in just a term.
*  That's really good news, and that's the sort of thing that the President's team has been
*  looking for for a long time.
*  Now, big caveat.
*  All of this could change.
*  Growth could slow.
*  Job growth could slow, and it could slow quite abruptly.
*  Inflation could spike again.
*  There are all sorts of reasons why economists in and outside of the administration cautioned
*  were not out of the woods yet.
*  The plane has not fully soft landed, but with that caveat there, it's looking better for
*  that soft landing story now than it has at any point of the last couple of years.
*  That's notwithstanding, this seems like very, very good news, right?
*  It wasn't at all a foregone conclusion that we would be here at this point.
*  What's responsible for this upturn?
*  What strategies deserve credit?
*  Well, I'm not a pilot, so I'm not going to be able to pull off a complete airplane metaphor
*  here as we land this.
*  I want to talk about it in terms of a car.
*  Think about landing your car.
*  Just go with me here, Sprint.
*  I'm following.
*  I've got you.
*  Okay.
*  So what has to happen to pull off the sort of outcome we're looking at here, which is
*  no recession, but bringing inflation down, is you need to have an engine, a motor, something
*  driving the growth in the economy that we continue to see.
*  While at the same time, a break, something that's bringing down prices that's stubbornly
*  high inflation that hit 40-year highs a year ago, you need to be reducing that while still
*  moving the economy forward.
*  There are policies that have been doing both these things, so let's separate them out.
*  President Biden started pouring fuel into the motor, if you will, with the stimulus bill
*  he signed in 2021.
*  It was $1.9 trillion, the American Rescue Plan.
*  He gave money to people and to businesses and to state and local governments, and that
*  money fed through to more consumer spending and more hiring and just sort of a very quick
*  return to low unemployment.
*  There's another thing that Biden did, and it's actually a bunch of things.
*  It's a bunch of bills that he signed after the stimulus.
*  The infrastructure bill, the semiconductor chips bill, both of which were bipartisan, and
*  then the inflation reduction act, which he signed a year ago, which is a climate bill,
*  basically clean energy.
*  All three of those bills have caused a bunch of investment in the economy, government investment
*  and private investment in building things, and that's part of the motor too.
*  We have seen a big uptick in manufacturing construction, the building of new factories and
*  new roads and things, and that's helping too.
*  I think that suite of policies that Biden signed into law has helped with the motor a lot
*  on the economy.
*  The tricky thing here is that those efforts were also contributing in some way to inflation.
*  All this money pouring into the economy was adding to the price hike we've been seeing,
*  and so that's what makes the brakes so important as a compliment to the motor, to bring down
*  inflation.
*  That largely has been the Federal Reserve.
*  The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates.
*  That has been reducing some economic activity, reducing lending, making credit much, much
*  tighter, and that has had the effect of bringing down inflation rather quickly.
*  Now some other things have too.
*  For example, oil prices spiked after Russia invaded Ukraine, but they'd come down since
*  then, and that's helped with inflation.
*  Supply chains have kind of healed themselves a bit, which were clogged after the pandemic.
*  It's helped with inflation, but the big thing most economists would say, the big break
*  is the Federal Reserve raising interest rates by quite a lot, quite rapidly, to reduce
*  economic activity and bring down inflation.
*  Okay, so there's been a good engine and effective brakes, both important things for the economy
*  and for cars.
*  And because this is relevant as we had toward an election year, I want to know bottom line
*  how much credit should Biden actually give for this?
*  So I'm going to give you the answer that economists would give, which is it's really hard to draw
*  a straight line between a president's policies and the exact performance of the economy.
*  But what I do think we can say that's fair is that Biden made a bet at the beginning
*  of his term, that it was better to do too much to rev up that motor and keep the economy
*  healing as fast as possible, growing as fast as possible, than to do too little.
*  He had this experience of after the 2008 financial crisis when he was vice president, the government
*  didn't do enough to rev the motor and it led to a really long and slow recovery, also basically
*  no inflation, but a long and slow recovery.
*  He made the calculation that it was better to do too much.
*  And if the good data we have right now continue, I think we can say that his bet appears
*  to be right now if the data hold paying off.
*  Right, the fear at the time, of course, was that all of these policies that Biden was
*  enacting, the motor stuff was going to really make inflation much worse and cause the economy
*  to go into recession.
*  But we have now lived into the answer, which is it hasn't.
*  So that needle was threaded by all accounts pretty deftly.
*  Yeah, I've been talking to officials inside the Biden administration for more than two
*  years now about their economic strategy and what they believed would happen and what
*  they hoped would happen.
*  I think it's really fair to say that that entire time they've been waiting for a moment
*  where inflation might get high, but it would come down where growth would still look strong
*  and where they could finally sort of look around the room at the naysayers and say, I told
*  you so, this economy is really good.
*  And when you talk to people inside the administration, they are finally feeling like, hey, we've
*  turned that corner, we might really pull this off and we were right all along.
*  Interesting.
*  So this is their moment.
*  It is.
*  And now the question is, can they convince everyone else in America to see it that way, too?
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Jim, you've laid out why we should see the economy is improved and that Biden does
*  deserve some credit for it, but whether Biden gets credit for it is up in the air.
*  So the question is why?
*  Well, I mean, there's a lot of reasons.
*  First off, he absolutely is not getting very much credit from voters right now.
*  He's what we call underwater on the economy.
*  Most people disapprove of his handling of it.
*  And if you look at our most recent near time, Sienna College poll, only like 20% of the country
*  thinks that the economy is excellent or good.
*  Now, good news for Biden.
*  That's double what it was last year, but it's still only 20%.
*  So a lot of people who are very online would say, that's just because the media is not
*  giving Biden enough credit for all the good things happening.
*  I don't think that that is at all supported by the numbers.
*  What's supported by the numbers is people have really good reason not to feel great about
*  this economy.
*  The biggest reason is just most people have not felt dramatic improvement in their lives
*  and their standard of living while Biden has been president.
*  Remember how I talked about wages outpacing inflation?
*  Well, that just started this spring.
*  That's really recent.
*  For the two years before that, people were actually falling behind inflation for most,
*  you know, the typical worker.
*  And there are all sorts of other measures by which people have been experiencing economic
*  difficulty.
*  But the biggest and most important one is prices.
*  People just don't like inflation.
*  And last year inflation was as high as it's been in four decades.
*  So if you wanted to know why people are grumpy about the economy, I actually don't think
*  it's much of a mystery.
*  They're grumpy because they haven't liked what they've seen from it up until now.
*  They're also really not great.
*  None of us are at dealing in what we might think of as counterfactuals.
*  What do you mean?
*  The Biden administration could say, hey, listen, if we had different policies, we could have
*  had mass unemployment for the last two years.
*  The job growth would have been much slower.
*  You might not even have a job.
*  But sitting where you are or where a typical worker is right now, you're not thinking, gee,
*  I'm so glad that my life is better just because I have a slightly lower inflation adjusted
*  salary, but I still have a job.
*  Right?
*  No, you're thinking, hey, I can't buy as much as I used to and eggs are more expensive.
*  Right.
*  And so I think for the last two years, that was a real narrative in people's heads.
*  And what the Biden team had to fight against is the persistence of that narrative even as
*  the data got better.
*  I mean, you're basically saying the upturn is kind of too recent in a way.
*  This inflation is still burned on people's brains.
*  And then for the people who are actually benefiting from a better economy, they don't necessarily
*  feel it because, you know, how do you feel if your life would be worse if certain things
*  hadn't happened?
*  As you say, counterfactual people don't live their lives that way.
*  Exactly.
*  And also just because the rate of inflation has fallen doesn't mean that prices have gone
*  back down.
*  So people have seen big price increases that are now baked in.
*  And I guess the new normal and a lower inflation rate just means slower increases off that
*  price level.
*  Prices remain high.
*  They're just not going up as fast as they used to.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  But the obvious caveat there being gas prices, which really have come down from where they
*  were last summer.
*  And I think our part of the reason why people are starting to feel a little bit better about
*  the economy.
*  Well, so what has the president been doing to try to change people's minds?
*  Like convince them that he is actually the one responsible for the things that are going
*  well.
*  Biden and his team have been engaged all summer in a campaign to sort of rebrand the economy
*  as a strength for him.
*  Thank you all very much.
*  Bob, thank you for that.
*  It started with this big speech he gave in Chicago back in June.
*  I should have talked about the economic vision for this country.
*  And that's where he sort of formally unveiled this concept that they call bi-nomics.
*  Bi-nomics.
*  I didn't come up with a name.
*  I really didn't.
*  I now claim it.
*  But what exactly is bi-nomics?
*  Well, bi-nomics is a lot of things.
*  It's actually a lot of the same stuff that Joe Biden has been talking about ever since
*  he started as president.
*  Bi-nomics is about building an economy from the middle out in the bottom up, not the top
*  down.
*  It's about the government spending money in order to kick start growth.
*  Making targeted investments to promote domestic production of semiconductors, batteries, electric
*  cars.
*  I think probably most importantly here, it's about the suite of policies that Biden has
*  signed, all the different bills.
*  Just creating our power grid, renovating our airports and ports.
*  Infrastructure and chips and the inflation reduction act and the American Rescue Plan
*  that form the backbone of this record of accomplishment that the president is running
*  on.
*  Why did economic spending damage to the future are going to grow right here at home.
*  At home.
*  I mean it.
*  Not at joke.
*  But there are some big differences now from the way he talked about it even a few months
*  ago.
*  One of the biggest differences is that Joe Biden used to do a lot more of feeling people's
*  pain when it came to inflation.
*  Ever economic speech he would talk about how he recognized how hard high prices were for
*  families to deal with and that he was going to do more to bring them down.
*  Now he just doesn't talk as much about it at all.
*  We're coming back and doing it again.
*  America's going to lead again.
*  He's really just leaning into manufacturing jobs and economic growth.
*  He's boosting labor unions.
*  He's helping low earners and people of color and women make more money and he's much more
*  unapologetically owning the economy and less sort of hedging and apologizing to the parts
*  that he knows people don't like.
*  And the heartland is small towns and every part of this country to raise their kids on
*  a good paycheck and keep the roots where they grew up.
*  That's Biden.
*  Okay, so besides the speech, Jim, what else has Biden been doing to make this Bidenomics
*  pitch?
*  I will use the word.
*  He does events around the country, ribbon cutting type events like at factories and clean
*  energy projects, new infrastructure, often surrounded by union workers and sometimes
*  in districts where the member of Congress there or in a state with the senator there voted
*  against the package, the bills that he's there to tout.
*  Interesting.
*  And he's talking at these events about the creation of new jobs and then he likes to talk
*  up about how his dad used to say to him, Joey, a job is about more than a paycheck.
*  You know, it's about dignity.
*  And that's a very Joe Biden way of talking about the economy.
*  Basically putting on display how all that investment is actually bearing fruit now.
*  Right.
*  And it helps that you can see more of the fruit.
*  I mean, there's more actual ground being broken on these projects.
*  There's more actual roads being built when I was out on a reporting trip this summer.
*  For the first time, I saw a road project with a sign next to it that said, you know, this
*  project funded by Joe Biden's infrastructure law.
*  They're starting to have those sorts of projects they can show people and that helps to make
*  that tangible case you're talking about.
*  So is this new strategy working?
*  It's hard to say exactly how much it's working, but we can look at where he's moving in the
*  polls and we can look at people's perceptions of the economy.
*  And on some measures, we're starting to see some improvement and some of that may be because
*  of the events, but it may also just be because the economy is improving like consumer confidence
*  is going up by a variety of measures, but you would expect that given the improvement
*  in the economic data.
*  Biden's polls are still pretty bad on the economy.
*  He's still underwater.
*  And like I said, it's still just 20% of the country who thinks the economy is excellent
*  or good.
*  It's quite low.
*  Yeah, in our poll, it's like half the country thinks it's poor.
*  So he's got a lot of work to do and these events, I think it's very fair to say, are not
*  immediately catalyzing a turnaround for him on the public opinion front.
*  Now there's some debate in sort of broader Biden world and also, you know, the political
*  commentary about why it is that Biden has not been able to move those numbers more given
*  how much he's done these events.
*  One obvious problem is that people don't actually seem that tuned in to his record.
*  A lot of polls show a lot of voters have no idea which bills Biden has signed into law
*  on the economy and what he's done.
*  There are people certainly around the president who also point to the president himself as a
*  problem in this that he's just not a guy who is made to command and sell a spotlight over
*  the economy.
*  He's going to keep doing his Joe Biden events and there's not a lot of creativity, I guess,
*  is the word that they would use in the way that he's trying to sell voters on the idea
*  that he's really done something amazing.
*  And there is some latent frustration in democratic circles that that might just continue to be the case.
*  That basically Biden is going to continue to struggle to sell voters on his economic successes
*  so long as Biden himself is the messenger.
*  You're saying there's only so much you can actually change about your PR strategy if your
*  messenger is the same guy.
*  Yeah, in part of it, Joe Biden has a very good brand on the economy historically.
*  He was middle-class Joe in the Obama administration and that definitely helped him in the 2020 election.
*  But now I think it's hard for him to expand that brand and I think particularly he is suffering
*  right now from comparisons the Democrats make with the economic salesmanship of his immediate
*  predecessor Donald Trump who just had a very different approach to selling his own economic
*  record and very different poll numbers with voters on the issue perhaps as a result.
*  Right. He employed salesmanship tactics that I think the Biden folks don't feel comfortable with.
*  He would bully individual companies over Twitter. You might remember before he was even elected,
*  he went after this air conditioning manufacturer in Indiana called Carrier over its plans to
*  outsource jobs to Mexico. He criticized them on Twitter, the company kind of relented and he
*  claimed credit for saving all those jobs. But in the end, hundreds of workers still got laid off
*  and he just didn't talk about that. Yeah. And voters, including independents and Democrats,
*  tended to rate him relatively highly on the economy, particularly when the economy was
*  very low unemployment before the pandemic hit. And you know, to that point, if we're thinking
*  this is going to be a rematch between Biden and Trump, it's a rematch between these two very
*  different people who are different in a million ways far beyond how they sell their economic policies.
*  So I guess my question is how much will this ability to sell the economy determine the next election?
*  I mean, as an economic policy reporter is always my preference that every election
*  everywhere be decided on economic policy ground. I do not think that is going to be the case this
*  time. I don't think anyone in either the Trump or the Biden camps thinks that this is going to be a
*  race one or lost on a debate over who has a better tax plan if it ends up being Biden versus Trump.
*  But I will say this and I don't think anyone disputes it. The underlying health of the economy
*  will matter enormously to the outcome of a possible rematch. If the economy continues to improve
*  the way that that it is now and does not fall into recession, that takes away an argument that
*  Trump would use against Biden. And if Biden can then on top of that, convinced voters more voters
*  than currently believe this, that he is actually to thank for that improvement in the economy.
*  That helps make his case easier for why he deserves a second term. If the economy falls into
*  recession, I think there's a lot of Republicans who believe that would make the job easier for Trump
*  or whoever their nominee is to beat Biden next fall. So ultimately you're saying it's not really
*  going to be about the economic policy of either candidate, but it is going to be about how people
*  feel about the economy. And at least right now, according to our poll, only 20% of people feel
*  like the economy isn't a good place. So that's pretty bad for Biden. Yeah, I mean, that's in a poll
*  where Biden and Trump are tied in a hypothetical rematch. I think if you asked the White House folks,
*  they would absolutely much rather have that number closer to 50% than 20%. If you look historically,
*  you'll see that the economy matters a lot in presidential elections,
*  to condictate presidential approval, which condictate whether presidents get reelected.
*  They're well aware of that. And they are trying to sell voters on the idea that his economic policies
*  have improved those economic conditions that people are feeling.
*  And that I think is the sort of you break it, you buy it risk to all this, right? Like,
*  Bidenomics is at its core, the president and his team picking their moment to convey to voters
*  actually, yes, this is Joe Biden's economy. Yes, I do own it. I own it. It's outcomes. And I
*  believe the outcomes are great. And you should like it. But man, if we do fall into recession,
*  if inflation does spike again, if people aren't feeling that improvement a year from now,
*  as the election bears down, that will be a very difficult thing to pull off for Joe Biden,
*  because he will have said this is Bidenomics. And he will be open to the critique that Bidenomics
*  has failed America. I mean, Bidenomics would be a Republican buffer sticker, right? Or a line in a
*  late-night show. Right. I think we will know a lot, not everything. This is a very complicated
*  potential election. But I think we will know a lot about the way things are going. A year from now,
*  when we see which party is using Bidenomics as sort of its slogan as part of making its case
*  to voters. Jim, thank you. Thank you so much.
*  On Friday, the Department of Labor reported that American employers added 187,000 jobs last month.
*  It was the 31st straight monthly gain for one of the economy's key indicators. And it pushed
*  the unemployment rate down to 3.5 percent near a record low. We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration approved
*  the first pill for postpartum depression. A milestone considered likely to increase recognition
*  and treatment of a debilitating condition that afflicts about half a million women in the United
*  States every year. And on Sunday, the United States, the two-time reigning champion of women's
*  soccer, was eliminated from the World Cup in a wrenching five to four defeat against Sweden
*  that played out through penalty kicks. The Americans controlled the shootout and teletrio of misses.
*  Yeah, it's a tough one and there's just some dark, dark comedy in me missing a penalty in my last
*  game ever. So it was the final match for star athlete and activist Megan Rapinoe,
*  who had hoped to retire from the sport as a three-time champion.
