# The Economy is on an Upswing. Should Biden Get Credit for It?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC0kLE1YRa4)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  After months of worry about a possible recession, it is now looking increasingly likely that
*  the U.S. has managed to avoid one.
*  Today, I talked to my colleague, Jim Tankersley, about that brighter economic picture, and
*  about why, at least so far, Americans aren't giving President Biden much credit for it.
*  It's Monday, August 7th.
*  So Jim, we've talked a bunch on the show about the economy and about how the government's
*  been trying to thread a needle, right?
*  Inflation on the one hand, while avoiding sending the economy into a recession on the
*  other.
*  And when we had you on the show last year, you talked about this and you said there were
*  two potential outcomes.
*  One was the U.S. would experience a soft landing, which as the name suggests is kind of pillowy
*  and painless, or the U.S. would experience a hard landing, which is a recession with
*  lots of job loss and pain.
*  Where are we today in the government's threading of that needle?
*  Well, I think let's be really direct about it.
*  We are in the midst of some of the best economic data, if not the best economic data, of Joe
*  Biden's presidency.
*  And those data are giving a lot of economists and forecasters more and more confidence that
*  they might pull this soft landing thing off, that it just might come to pass, that the
*  economy is able to make it out of high inflation without falling back into a recession and
*  do so in a way that really starts to deliver the kinds of outcomes for workers that President
*  Biden's been wanting to do all along.
*  So tell us about that data.
*  What do you see?
*  We're seeing a bunch of things that are encouraging.
*  The first is on growth.
*  The economy keeps growing and adding jobs faster than economists predicted.
*  So in the second quarter this year, the economy expanded at a 2.4% annual rate.
*  That was way better than most economists thought it would be.
*  At the same time, the job market just continues to turn on.
*  Month after month, we are seeing hundreds of thousands of jobs being added to the economy,
*  despite the fact that forecasters keep waiting for that to slow down, despite the fact that
*  President Biden himself has been waiting for that to slow down.
*  It is slowing down, but very gradually.
*  And that growth, the combination of job growth and economic growth, is really powering the
*  economy forward.
*  At the same time, and I think this is the most encouraging thing to people who are out
*  shopping right now, or if you're the president, to his advisors, is the fact that inflation
*  is coming down.
*  A year ago, we had like 7% annual inflation by one measure, and now it's 3%.
*  This is way better than I think a lot of economists thought we could pull off with those continued
*  growth rates that I mentioned.
*  And one more really important thing, really great sign for the economy, is that people's
*  standard of living is starting to improve in a way that it hadn't at the first couple
*  of years of the Biden presidency.
*  Hourly wages rose faster than prices did in the spring, for the first time in two years,
*  which just means people have more money to spend, their incomes are actually going up,
*  even in inflation in just two terms.
*  That's really good news, and that's the sort of thing that the president's team has been
*  looking for for a long time.
*  Right.
*  Now, big caveat.
*  All of this could change.
*  Growth could slow.
*  Job growth could slow, and it could slow quite abruptly.
*  Inflation could spike again.
*  There are all sorts of reasons why economists in and outside of the administration caution
*  we're not out of the woods yet.
*  The plane has not fully soft landed.
*  But with that caveat there, it's looking better for that soft landing story now than it has
*  at any point in the last couple of years.
*  Caveats notwithstanding, this seems like very, very good news, right?
*  It wasn't at all a foregone conclusion that we would be here at this point.
*  What's responsible for this upturn?
*  What strategies deserve credit?
*  I'm not a pilot, so I'm not going to be able to pull off a complete airplane metaphor here
*  as we land this.
*  I want to talk about it in terms of a car.
*  Think about landing your car.
*  Just go with me.
*  Here's France.
*  I'm following.
*  Okay.
*  So, what has to happen to pull off the sort of outcome we're looking at here, which is
*  no recession but bringing inflation down, is you need to have an engine, a motor, something
*  driving the growth in the economy that we continue to see.
*  While at the same time, a break, something that's bringing down prices, that stubbornly
*  high inflation that hit 40-year highs a year ago, you need to be reducing that while still
*  moving the economy forward.
*  There are policies that have been doing both these things, so let's separate them out.
*  President Biden started pouring fuel into the motor, if you will, with the stimulus
*  bill he signed in 2021.
*  It was $1.9 trillion, the American Rescue Plan.
*  He gave money to people and to businesses and to state and local governments, and that
*  money fed through to more consumer spending and more hiring and just sort of a very quick
*  return to low unemployment.
*  There's another thing though that Biden did, and it's actually a bunch of things.
*  There's a bunch of bills that he signed after the stimulus.
*  The infrastructure bill, the semiconductor chips bill, both of which were bipartisan,
*  and then the Inflation Reduction Act, which he signed a year ago, which is a climate bill,
*  basically clean energy.
*  All three of those bills have caused a bunch of investment in the economy, government investment
*  and private investment in building things.
*  And that's part of the motor too.
*  We have seen a big uptick in manufacturing construction, the building of new factories
*  and new roads and things.
*  And that's helping too.
*  So I think that suite of policies that Biden signed into law has helped with the motor
*  a lot on the economy.
*  But the tricky thing here is that those efforts were also contributing in some way to inflation.
*  All this money pouring into the economy was adding to the price hikes we've been seeing.
*  And so that's what makes the brakes so important as a complement to the motor, to bring down
*  inflation.
*  And that largely has been the Federal Reserve.
*  The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates that has been reducing some economic
*  activity, reducing lending, making credit much, much tighter.
*  And that has had the effect of bringing down inflation rather quickly.
*  Now some other things have too.
*  For example, oil prices spiked after Russia invaded Ukraine, but they've come down since
*  then and that's helped with inflation.
*  Supply chains have kind of healed themselves a bit, which were clogged after the pandemic.
*  That's helped with inflation.
*  But the big thing most economists would say, the big break is the Federal Reserve raising
*  interest rates by quite a lot, quite rapidly, to reduce economic activity and bring down
*  inflation.
*  Okay, so there's been a good engine and effective breaks, both important things for the economy
*  and for cars.
*  And because this is relevant, as we head toward an election year, I want to know, bottom line,
*  how much credit should Biden actually get for this?
*  So I'm going to give you the answer that economists would give, which is it's really hard to draw
*  a straight line between a president's policies and the exact performance of the economy.
*  But what I do think we can say that's fair is that Biden made a bet at the beginning
*  of his term that it was better to do too much to rev up that motor and keep the economy
*  healing as fast as possible, growing as fast as possible than to do too little.
*  He had this experience of after the 2008 financial crisis when he was vice president, the government
*  didn't do enough to rev the motor and it led to a really long and slow recovery.
*  Also basically no inflation, but a long and slow recovery.
*  He made the calculation that it was better to do too much.
*  And if the good data we have right now continue, I think we can say that his bet appears to
*  be right now, if the data hold paying off.
*  Right.
*  The fear at the time, of course, was that all of these policies that Biden was enacting,
*  the motor stuff was going to really make inflation much worse and cause the economy to go into
*  recession.
*  But we have now lived into the answer, which is it hasn't.
*  So that needle was threaded by all accounts pretty deftly.
*  Yeah.
*  I've been talking to officials inside the Biden administration for more than two years
*  now about their economic strategy and what they believed would happen and what they hoped
*  would happen.
*  I think it's really fair to say that for that entire time they've been waiting for a moment
*  where inflation might get high, but it would come down, where growth would still look strong
*  and where they could finally sort of look around the room at the naysayers and say,
*  I told you so.
*  This economy is really good.
*  When you talk to people inside the administration, they are finally feeling like, hey, we've
*  turned that corner.
*  We might really pull this off.
*  And we were right all along.
*  Interesting.
*  So this is their moment.
*  It is.
*  And now the question is, can they convince everyone else in America to see it that way
*  too?
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Jim, you've laid out why we should see the economy is improved and that Biden does
*  deserve some credit for it.
*  But whether Biden gets credit for it is up in the air.
*  So the question is why?
*  Well, I mean, there's a lot of reasons.
*  First off, he absolutely is not getting very much credit from voters right now.
*  He's what we call underwater on the economy.
*  Most people disapprove of his handling of it.
*  And if you look at our most recent New York Times, CNN College poll, only like 20% of
*  the country thinks that the economy is excellent or good.
*  Good news for Biden.
*  That's double what it was last year, but it's still only 20%.
*  So a lot of people who are very online would say that's just because the media is not giving
*  Biden enough credit for all the good things happening.
*  I don't think that that is at all supported by the numbers.
*  What's supported by the numbers is people have really good reason not to feel great
*  about this economy.
*  The biggest reason is just most people have not felt dramatic improvement in their lives
*  and their standard of living while Biden has been president.
*  Remember how I talked about wages outpacing inflation?
*  Well, that just started this spring.
*  That's really recent.
*  For the two years before that, people were actually falling behind inflation for most,
*  you know, the typical worker.
*  And there are all sorts of other measures by which people have been experiencing economic
*  difficulty, but the biggest and most important one is prices.
*  People just don't like inflation.
*  And last year, inflation was as high as it's been in four decades.
*  So if you want to know why people are grumpy about the economy, I actually don't think
*  it's much of a mystery.
*  They're grumpy because they haven't liked what they've seen from it up until now.
*  They're also really not great, none of us are, at dealing in what you might think of
*  as counterfactuals.
*  What do you mean?
*  The Biden administration could say, hey, listen, if we'd had different policies, we could have
*  had mass unemployment for the last two years.
*  The job growth would have been much slower.
*  You might not even have a job.
*  But sitting where you are or where a typical worker is right now, you're not thinking,
*  gee, I'm so glad that my life is better just because I have a slightly lower inflation
*  adjusted salary, but I still have a job.
*  Right?
*  No, you're thinking, hey, I can't buy as much as I used to and eggs are more expensive.
*  Right.
*  And so I think for the last two years, that was a real narrative in people's heads.
*  And what the Biden team had to fight against is the persistence of that narrative, even
*  as the data got better.
*  I mean, you're basically saying the upturn is kind of too recent in a way.
*  This inflation is still burned on people's brains.
*  And then for the people who are actually benefiting from a better economy, they don't
*  necessarily feel it because, you know, how do you feel if your life would be worse if
*  certain things hadn't happened?
*  As you say, counterfactual, people don't live their lives that way.
*  Exactly.
*  And also, just because the rate of inflation has fallen doesn't mean that prices have
*  gone back down.
*  So people have seen big price increases that are now baked in like it's the new normal.
*  And a lower inflation rate just means slower increases off that price level.
*  Prices remain high.
*  They're just not going up as fast as they used to.
*  Right. Exactly.
*  But the obvious caveat there being gas prices, which really have come down from where they
*  were last summer and I think are part of the reason why people are starting to feel a little
*  bit better about the economy.
*  Well, so what has the president been doing to try to change people's minds, like convince
*  them that he is actually the one responsible for the things that are going well?
*  Biden and his team have been engaged all summer in a campaign to sort of rebrand the economy
*  as a strength for him.
*  Thank you all very much.
*  And Bob, thank you.
*  It started with this big speech he gave in Chicago back in June.
*  I want you to talk about the economic vision for this country.
*  And that's where he sort of formally unveiled this concept that they call Bidenomics.
*  I didn't come up with the name.
*  I really didn't.
*  I now claim it.
*  So what exactly is Bidenomics?
*  Well, Bidenomics is a lot of things.
*  It's actually a lot of the same stuff that Joe Biden has been talking about ever since
*  he started as president.
*  Bidenomics is about building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the
*  top down.
*  It's about the government spending money in order to kickstart growth.
*  Making targeted investments to promote domestic production of semiconductors, batteries, electric
*  cars.
*  And I think probably most importantly here, it's about the suite of policies that Biden
*  has signed.
*  All the different bills.
*  Upgrading our power grid, renovating our airports and ports.
*  Infrastructure and chips and the Inflation Reduction Act and the American Rescue Plan
*  that form the backbone of this record of accomplishment that the president is running on.
*  Biden economics means the industry, the future is going to grow right here at home.
*  At home.
*  I mean it.
*  Not a joke.
*  But there are some big differences now from the way he talked about it even a few months
*  ago.
*  One of the biggest differences is that Joe Biden used to do a lot more of feeling people's
*  pain when it came to inflation.
*  Every economic speech he would talk about how he recognized how hard high prices were
*  for families to deal with and that he was going to do more to bring them down.
*  Now he just doesn't talk as much about it at all.
*  We're coming back and doing it again.
*  America's going to lead again.
*  He's really just leaning into manufacturing jobs and economic growth.
*  He's boosting labor unions.
*  He's helping low earners and people of color and women make more money.
*  And he's much more unapologetically owning the economy and less sort of hedging and apologizing
*  the parts of it he knows people don't like.
*  In the heartland, in small towns, in every part of this country, to raise their kids
*  on a good paycheck and keep the roots where they grew up.
*  That's Bidenomics.
*  OK, so besides the speech, Jim, what else has Biden been doing to make this Bidenomics
*  pitch?
*  He does events around the country, ribbon cutting type events, like at factories and
*  clean energy projects, new infrastructure, often surrounded by union workers and sometimes
*  in districts where the member of Congress there or in a state with the senator there
*  voted against the package, the bills that he's there to tout.
*  Interesting.
*  And he's talking at these events about the creation of new jobs.
*  And then he likes to talk up about how his dad used to say to him, Joey, a job is about
*  more than a paycheck.
*  It's about dignity.
*  And that's a very Joe Biden way of talking about the economy.
*  Basically putting on display how all of that investment is actually bearing fruit now.
*  Right. And it helps that you can see more of the fruit.
*  I mean, there's more actual ground being broken on these projects.
*  There's more actual roads being built.
*  When I was out on a reporting trip this summer, for the first time, I saw a road project
*  with a sign next to it that said, you know, this project funded by Joe Biden's
*  infrastructure law.
*  They're starting to have those sorts of projects they can show people.
*  And that helps to make that tangible case you're talking about.
*  So is this new strategy working?
*  It's hard to say exactly how much it's working, but we can look at where he's moving
*  in the polls and we can look at people's perceptions of the economy.
*  And on some measures, we're starting to see some improvement.
*  And some of that may be because of the events, but it may also just be because the economy
*  is improving, like consumer confidence is going up by a variety of measures.
*  But you would expect that given the improvement in the economic data.
*  Biden's polls are still pretty bad on the economy.
*  He's still underwater.
*  And like I said, it's still just 20 percent of the country who thinks the economy is
*  excellent or good.
*  It's quite low. Yeah.
*  In our poll, it's like half the country thinks it's poor.
*  So he's got a lot of work to do.
*  And these events, I think it's very fair to say, are not immediately catalyzing a
*  turnaround for him on the public opinion front.
*  Now, there's some debate in sort of broader Biden world and also, you know, the
*  political commentariat about why it is that Biden has not been able to move those
*  numbers more given how much he's done these events.
*  One obvious problem is that people don't actually seem that tuned in to his record.
*  A lot of polls show a lot of voters have no idea which bills Biden has signed into
*  the law on the economy and what he's done.
*  But there are people certainly around the president who also point to the president
*  himself as a problem in this, that he's just not a guy who is made to command and
*  sell a spotlight over the economy.
*  He's going to keep doing his Joe Biden events.
*  And there's not a lot of creativity, I guess, is the word that they would use in the
*  way that he's trying to sell voters on the idea that he's really done something
*  amazing. And there is some latent frustration in democratic circles that that
*  might just continue to be the case that basically Biden is going to continue to
*  struggle to sell voters on his economic successes.
*  So long as Biden himself is the messenger.
*  You're saying there's only so much you can actually change about your PR strategy if
*  your messenger is the same guy.
*  Well, yeah, and part of it is Joe Biden has a very good brand on the economy
*  historically. He was middle class Joe, right, in the Obama administration.
*  And that definitely helped him in the 2020 election.
*  But now I think it's hard for him to expand that brand.
*  And I think particularly he is suffering right now from comparisons the Democrats
*  make with the economic salesmanship of his immediate predecessor, Donald Trump, who
*  just had a very different approach to selling his own economic record and very
*  different poll numbers with voters on the issue, perhaps as a result.
*  Right. You know, he employed salesmanship tactics that I think the Biden folks
*  don't feel comfortable with.
*  He would bully individual companies over Twitter.
*  You might remember before he was even elected, he went after this air conditioning
*  manufacturer in Indiana called Carrier over its plans to outsource jobs to Mexico.
*  He criticized them on Twitter.
*  The company kind of relented and he claimed credit for saving all those jobs.
*  But in the end, hundreds of workers still got laid off and he just didn't talk about
*  that. Yeah. And voters, including independents and Democrats, tended to rate him
*  relatively highly on the economy, particularly when the economy was at very low
*  unemployment before the pandemic hit.
*  And, you know, to that point, if we're thinking this is going to be a rematch between
*  Biden and Trump, it's a rematch between these two very different people who are
*  different in a million ways far beyond how they sell their economic policies.
*  So I guess my question is, how much will this ability to sell the economy determine
*  the next election? I mean, as an economic policy reporter, it is always my preference
*  that every election everywhere be decided on economic policy grounds.
*  I do not think that is going to be the case this time.
*  I don't think anyone in either the Trump or the Biden camps thinks that this is
*  going to be a race won or lost on a debate over who has a better tax plan if it
*  ends up being Biden versus Trump. But I will say this, and I don't think anyone
*  disputes it. The underlying health of the economy will matter enormously to the
*  outcome of a possible rematch.
*  If the economy continues to improve the way that that it is now and does not fall
*  into recession, that takes away an argument that Trump would use against Biden.
*  And if Biden can then on top of that convince voters, more voters than currently
*  believe this, that he is actually to thank for that improvement in the economy,
*  that helps make his case easier for why he deserves a second term.
*  If the economy falls into recession, I think there's a lot of Republicans who
*  believe that would make the job easier for Trump or whoever their nominee is to
*  beat Biden next fall.
*  So ultimately, you're saying it's not really going to be about the economic
*  policy of either candidate, but it is going to be about how people feel about
*  the economy. And at least right now, according to our poll, only 20 percent of
*  people feel like the economy is in a good place.
*  So that's pretty bad for Biden.
*  Yeah, I mean, that's in a poll where Biden and Trump are tied in a hypothetical
*  rematch. I think if you asked the White House folks, they would absolutely much
*  rather have that number closer to 50 percent than 20 percent.
*  If you look historically, you'll see that the economy matters a lot in presidential
*  elections can dictate presidential approval, which can dictate whether
*  presidents get reelected.
*  They're well aware of that and they are trying to sell voters on the idea that
*  his economic policies have improved those economic conditions that people are
*  feeling. And that, I think, is the sort of you break it, you buy it risk to all
*  this. Right. Like Bidenomics is at its core, the president and his team picking
*  their moment to convey to voters, actually, yes, this is Joe Biden's economy.
*  Yes, I do own it.
*  I own its outcomes. And I believe the outcomes are great and you should like it.
*  But man, if we do fall into recession, if inflation does spike again, if people
*  aren't feeling that improvement a year from now, as the election bears down, that
*  will be a very difficult thing to pull off for Joe Biden, because he will have said
*  this is Bidenomics and he will be open to the critique that Bidenomics has failed
*  America. I mean, Bidenomics would be a Republican bumper sticker, right?
*  Or a line in a late night show.
*  Right. I think we will know a lot.
*  Not everything. This is a very complicated potential election.
*  But I think we will know a lot about the way things are going a year from now when
*  we see which party is using Bidenomics as sort of its slogan as part of making its
*  case to voters.
*  Jim, thank you.
*  Thank you so much.
*  On Friday, the Department of Labor reported that American employers added one
*  hundred and eighty seven thousand jobs last month.
*  It was the 31st straight monthly gain for one of the economy's key indicators, and
*  it pushed the unemployment rate down to three point five percent, near a record low.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first pill for postpartum
*  depression, a milestone considered likely to increase recognition and treatment of a
*  debilitating condition that afflicts about half a million women in the United States
*  every year.
*  And on Sunday, the United States, the two time reigning champion of women's soccer
*  was eliminated from the World Cup in a wrenching five to four defeat against Sweden
*  that played out through penalty kicks.
*  The Americans controlled the shootout until a trio of misses.
*  Yeah, it's a it's a tough one.
*  And there's just some dark, dark comedy and me missing a penalty in my last game
*  ever. So it was the final match.
*  For star athlete and activist Megan Rapinoe, who had hoped to retire from the sport as
*  a three time champion.
