# The Sunday Read: ‘The America That Americans Forget’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbfkKeLKFZ0)
*  If you've listened to what lawmakers and journalists and foreign policy are talking
*  about lately, one theme is abundantly clear.
*  The rhetoric between China and the US is rising to an incredibly tense level, alarmingly fast.
*  There's an American military buildup in the Pacific right now that's on a scale we haven't
*  seen there since World War II.
*  So what would actually happen if the US were to go to war with China?
*  Researchers at one think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, developed
*  a war game.
*  They looked at what might happen if China and the US went to war over Taiwan in 2026.
*  They ran their scenario 24 times.
*  And in every iteration they conducted, China's first attack on US soil was bombing Guam.
*  Every single time.
*  Guam.
*  My name is Sarah Topol and I'm a contributing writer for the New York Times Magazine.
*  Guam is the biggest and southernmost island of the Northern Mariana Island chain in the
*  Western Pacific Ocean.
*  What's interesting about Guam is that it's an unincorporated US territory, which means
*  the island is a possession of the United States, but not an equal member of the Union.
*  In a series of Supreme Court cases called the Insular Cases, the court decided that
*  certain US territories were, quote, inhabited by alien races, unquote.
*  So the full constitution didn't have to apply there.
*  That also means that the 154,000 civilians who reside on Guam can't vote for president.
*  They also don't have a senator and they have just one non-voting member of the House.
*  They get a small fraction of the federal funding that states do.
*  The indigenous people of Guam, the Chamorro, only got US citizenship in 1950, more than
*  half a century after the US took Guam from Spain in the same concession that gave them
*  Puerto Rico and the Philippines.
*  Today the US military owns almost a third of the island.
*  It has one of the highest rates of veterans per capita in the country, though Guam ranks
*  at the very bottom for the number of veterans services it offers.
*  And any law passed by Guam's local government can be overruled by Congress.
*  So Guam is an internationally recognized American colony.
*  It's been on a UN list for decolonization since 1946.
*  And it might surprise you to hear this, but there's this whole vast American empire in
*  the Pacific, including Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Micronesia, Palau, and the
*  Marshall Islands, that spread out over an area about the size of the contiguous United States.
*  So for the Sunday read you're about to hear, I spent six weeks traveling around the Pacific,
*  looking at the history and breadth of American empire in the region.
*  The US dominates many aspects of life there, but the islands were almost never mentioned
*  in DC until the US rivalry with China reminded the metropole of their existence.
*  Now these islands are the setting of a soft power tug of war between the US and China,
*  in this massive military buildup.
*  I was interested in Guam in part because the people there have had the least say in their
*  situation.
*  Guam has been colonized for over 350 years.
*  Since the US took over from the Spanish in 1898, the island has always been used for
*  military purposes.
*  Now it's the home of the first Marine Corps base camp built since 1952.
*  These people, primarily the indigenous population, never had a say in whether they were going
*  to be the hub of this military buildup.
*  And yet when I landed there, I saw the presence of the US military everywhere.
*  Driving around Guam, it looked like strip mall America on military steroids.
*  There were recruitment offices all over the place.
*  Military fencing and defense installations that looked like giant golf balls were everywhere
*  I turned.
*  I met many people there, including a Marine veteran named Roy Gamboa.
*  To me, he sort of embodied in one person the complicated nature of the US military presence
*  in the Pacific.
*  How the so-called defense of freedom and sovereignty is being built on the back of the least free
*  part of the United States.
*  As I talked with Roy and others around the region, I thought about how the US is putting
*  Americans at risk for a new war with a direct impact on citizens in ways our wars haven't
*  entailed since 1941.
*  Yet almost no one in the continental US seems to be aware of these stakes and how exponentially
*  they're rising.
*  If the US decides to go to war in the Pacific, do Americans even know what that means?
*  I wanted to ask if we understood who it involves or what injustices it perpetuates.
*  So here's my article, The America That Americans Forget, read by Emily Wu-Zeller and reported
*  with support from the International Women's Media Foundation's Howard G. Buffett Fund
*  for Women Journalists.
*  On the weekends, when Roy Gamboa was a little boy, his grandfather woke him before dawn.
*  He would pour some coffee into a bowl of rice, and that would be the boy's breakfast.
*  Roy knew better than to question anything.
*  He sat quietly in his grandfather's truck as they rumbled down the big hill from their
*  village, Agate, to Big Navy, as the US naval base in Guam is known.
*  They passed through the military gates, along a dirt road and onto the shore of a little
*  cove next to one of America's deepest harbors, where skipjacks flipped out of the aquamarine
*  water.
*  The boy noodled with seashells as his grandfather cast.
*  When his grandfather caught a fish, he would unhook it and throw it on the ground, and
*  Roy would snatch it up and quickly stuff it, still wriggling, in the bag.
*  If the fish weren't biting at one spot, they packed up and moved to another.
*  No one from the Navy ever stopped the old man and the young boy.
*  Some mornings, his grandfather would take Roy back across the dirt road into the jungle
*  to pick papayas, lemons, and coconuts.
*  He would thrash a course into the thicket to collect firewood from the slender trees.
*  Tangentangin in Chamoru, the language of the indigenous inhabitants of Guam, which Roy's
*  grandmothers and grandfathers were.
*  They would cut the logs into quarters to dry, and stack them higher than Roy could even
*  reach.
*  Other mornings, the man and the boy went to the same spot to cut the grass, all the way
*  from the cove's blue waters to the ruins of an old cemetery.
*  Why are we the only ones cutting the grass here?
*  Roy would ask.
*  Boy, this was our land before the war, his grandfather would reply, pointing to forty
*  acres running from the cemetery to the water to the jungle, over the road and back almost
*  as far as their eyes could see.
*  We're taking care of it because we hope, one day, in the future, our land will be returned
*  to us.
*  Roy didn't really understand what his grandfather was talking about.
*  It would take him years to realize it was related to Guam's status as an unincorporated
*  territory, which means the island is a possession of the United States.
*  It was just normal that no one residing on Guam could vote for president, that the U.S.
*  territory had no senator, and only one non-voting member of the House.
*  Roy's grandfather never spoke about how their island had been colonized for hundreds
*  of years, first by the Spanish, beginning in 1668, and then the Americans, in 1898,
*  until they fled in 1941, returning three years later to liberate the Chamoru people from
*  brutal Japanese occupation.
*  Growing up, Roy was told that Uncle Sam had saved the Chamoru, and that in return, because
*  their people did not have much, they gave up their sons and their daughters to military
*  service so others around the world could have their own freedom.
*  You know the saying, if you can read and write, thank a teacher.
*  If you can read and write in English, thank a veteran, Roy told me.
*  Guam, with its strategic location, quickly became home to Anderson Air Force Base, where
*  B-52 bombers deploy on a rotational basis, and naval base Guam was expanded.
*  The Guam Tourism Board's slogan, Where America's Day Begins, was everywhere.
*  The Guam Chamber of Commerce proudly proclaimed the island America in Asia, while Guam's
*  license plates read Guam, USA.
*  And underneath that, they also said, Tano-i-Chamoru, the land of the Chamoru.
*  This sense of dual identity, but also a kind of second-class status, was confusing in ways
*  Roy couldn't even begin to express.
*  So Roy and his family, like many around them, just didn't.
*  It wasn't really in their culture to rock the boat or talk about some of the more unpleasant
*  things.
*  Roy wasn't taught that the Americans had banned the Chamoru language for decades, which
*  is one reason Roy himself didn't speak it well.
*  Or that the Americans had been the ones to abandon the Chamoru to the Japanese in the
*  first place.
*  Or that upon their return, the U.S. Navy annexed the entire island, and then started carving
*  out the best land for military use, displacing entire villages, including that of his paternal
*  and maternal grandparents.
*  Today the military owns nearly a third of Guam's 217 square miles, which is roughly
*  the size of Chicago.
*  Since then, Guam has become a strategic node in America's designs in the Pacific.
*  It is commonly referred to as the tip of the sphere, a place from which the United States
*  can project military might across Asia.
*  As geopolitical tensions rise, Guam's importance to American military planners only increases,
*  and so does the risk to those who live there.
*  In every iteration of war games between the United States and China run by the Center
*  for Strategic and International Studies, CSIS, Beijing's first strike on U.S. soil has been
*  to bomb Guam.
*  Yet the island is largely forgotten by most Americans.
*  Guam plays a central role in homeland defense, though it rarely shows up on maps or in textbooks
*  about the homeland.
*  No place tries harder to show its patriotism and gets so little recognition in return.
*  The island is missing from many NGO and U.S. government lists, for example, a USDA economic
*  research service poverty chart, while websites like those of Air France and the World Bank
*  list Guam as a separate place entirely.
*  The New York Times, like many other publications, did not include Guam or any American Pacific
*  Island territory on the national COVID map.
*  On Guam alone, there are currently 71 military construction projects valued at over $4 billion,
*  and the Department of Defense has committed to more than $11 billion in construction there
*  over the next five years, including a missile defense system comprising up to 20 individual
*  sites to achieve 360-degree defense of the island, expected to be operational by 2027.
*  There are three military construction projects in Micronesia for $432 million, seven in the
*  Northern Marianas for $388.6 million, three projects at $180.4 million on Wake Island,
*  and one in Palau for $121 million.
*  These islands are the United States' closest allies or territories.
*  They are also among the poorest, most disenfranchised parts of America.
*  If the United States decides to go to war in the Pacific, would the rest of America
*  really understand what that means, whom it involves, or what injustices it perpetuates?
*  What does America in Asia really look like?
*  Where does America's day actually begin?
*  The Pacific Island region, sometimes called the Blue Continent, stretching from Australia
*  and New Zealand to Kiribati and French Polynesia, has long been on the periphery of America's
*  understanding of its empire.
*  The United States has ruled, nuked, resettled, been attacked from, and fought wars on the
*  smaller islands scattered across the Pacific over a span of more than 100 years.
*  Yet Washington never issued a national security document for the region until September 2022,
*  when the Biden administration released the first-ever Pacific Partnership Strategy.
*  The United States is a Pacific nation, the document stated, going on to explain that
*  Washington has an interest in ensuring that growing geopolitical competition does not
*  undermine the sovereignty and security of the Pacific Islands, of the United States,
*  or of our allies and partners.
*  The country's renewed attention came in response to China's growing regional assertiveness.
*  A rising brinkmanship between the two powers now threatens all the islands caught between.
*  Build-up begets build-up.
*  The difference between deterrence and escalation is a matter of perspective.
*  China has created islands in the South China Sea with the explicit purpose of building
*  military bases on them.
*  The Defense Department says Beijing has roughly 300 DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missiles
*  capable of striking Guam.
*  In 2020, China's Air Force released a slick video showing a pilot in a nuclear-capable
*  H-6 bomber launching a cruise missile strike against an airfield that looked exactly like
*  Anderson.
*  In March 2021, America's top military officer in the Indo-Pacific region told a Senate hearing
*  that he believed China could invade Taiwan in the next six years.
*  I hope I am wrong, General Mike Minahan, commander of Air Mobility Command, wrote in a memo leaked
*  in January 2023.
*  My gut tells me we will fight in 2025.
*  China's warplane incursions into Taiwan's air defense zone nearly doubled last year.
*  The CSIS war games that decimated Guam every time was modeling a conflict over Taiwan set
*  in 2026.
*  American policymakers seem equally enthusiastic to beat the drums of war.
*  China appears to be the only bipartisan word on the Hill these days.
*  The Pentagon's budget for the Pacific Deterrence Initiative is up 40% this year.
*  The National Security Council is stacked with China hawks talking about economic decoupling,
*  and the State Department has set up a China House to track what Beijing is doing around
*  the world.
*  The spy balloon incident earlier this year showed just how quickly brinkmanship can get
*  out of control.
*  According to U.S. officials, the balloon was originally sent to survey military activity
*  on Guam before it went in the wrong direction.
*  China is not the only perceived threat in the region.
*  In January 2022, North Korea test-launched an intermediate-range ballistic missile capable
*  of reaching Guam, its most significant weapons launch in years.
*  The missile, which is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, was nicknamed the Guam
*  Killer when it was first tested in 2017.
*  It would take just 18 minutes to reach the island.
*  America has long expected subservience from Guam.
*  Over hundreds of years of colonization, the island has been used as an outpost, a naval
*  base, a launching pad, and a pawn.
*  A poem people often cited to me about Guam is titled, My Island is One Big American Footnote.
*  Footnote or not, from the time of their acquisition, Guam and the other territories exerted their
*  own subtle influence on the United States.
*  The country wasn't colloquially referred to as America until 1898.
*  Theodore Roosevelt popularized the term in speeches after the country became much greater
*  than a federation of states.
*  Three years after Manifest Destiny's conquest of the American West ended, the country began
*  to expand overseas.
*  First it took possession of dozens of uninhabited islands in the Caribbean and the Pacific,
*  primarily for the harvesting of guano.
*  The United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867.
*  In 1893, Americans overthrew the monarchy in Hawaii, then later annexed the island.
*  In 1898, under the Treaty of Paris that ended the Spanish-American War, Spain sold the United
*  States the Philippines for $20 million and included Puerto Rico and Guam for free.
*  Wake Island and American Samoa followed in 1899, and the United States purchased the
*  Virgin Islands in 1917.
*  By the end of World War II, 135 million people lived under U.S. rule outside the continental
*  United States.
*  America's overseas territories made up nearly a fifth of its land area, according to Daniel
*  Imrevar, associate professor of history at Northwestern University, in his book How to
*  Hide an Empire.
*  Guam's value as a strategic location was evident immediately.
*  A convenient point between Hawaii and the Philippines, the island was to become a naval
*  coaling and watering station.
*  Guam was put under the control of the Navy, and the Chamoru became American subjects,
*  not U.S. citizens.
*  Fewer permanent guarantees of liberty and property rights exist now than under Spanish
*  domain.
*  A 1901 Chamoru petition to the naval authorities requesting a civilian government read,
*  The Navy blocked their requests.
*  As Robert F. Rogers, retired professor of political history at the University of Guam,
*  wrote in Destiny's Landfall,
*  Until World War II, the island would be administered as if it were a warship, the USS Guam, with
*  the governor as captain, American military personnel as crew, and the Chamorros as mess
*  attendants.
*  In 1941, as Washington watched the Japanese build up across the Pacific, the United States
*  began evacuating all American military dependents from Guam.
*  In an earlier military assessment in the run-up to the war, the Navy graded Guam as
*  category F, unworthy of protecting and fortifying.
*  All that remained to face the Japanese was a small Navy detachment and the Chamoru Insular
*  Force Guard, who had a few basic training rifles.
*  Many of them went home to protect their own families and land.
*  After two days of bombing, on December 10th, the U.S. military-appointed governor surrendered.
*  The Japanese rounded up Chamoru leaders with ties to the United States, Insular Force Guard
*  members were taken as prisoners of war, and Chamoru women were raped.
*  The entire population of Sumai Village, where Roy Gamboa's family lived, was displaced.
*  In 1944, with the American recapture of Guam clearly on the horizon, the Japanese launched
*  a campaign of rapes and mass killings.
*  Though some Chamoru tried to fight the Japanese, the overwhelming narrative holds that American
*  soldiers were the saviors of Guam.
*  Every year on July 21st, the island shuts down for the Liberation Day Parade, a grand
*  military procession down Marine Corps Drive to mark the anniversary of Uncle Sam's return.
*  One of those things that comes about from a long colonial experience is this idea that
*  things change because somebody brings it to you.
*  You are not the agent of change.
*  Michael Lujan-Bivakwa, historian and curator of the Guam Museum, told me,
*  When you're thinking about remembering the war, do you put a brave American soldier?
*  Or do you put a shirtless Chamoru man coming out of a concentration camp?
*  Which one fits?
*  At the time, Chamorros couldn't see themselves in that role.
*  Upon America's return at the end of World War II, the island reverted to naval control.
*  Chamoru were denied U.S. citizenship, and land dispossession was rampant.
*  Tumai was developed into naval-based Guam.
*  Nearly 11,000 Chamoru, half the population at that time, lost their property.
*  A class-action lawsuit filed in 1983 ended with a settlement of $39.5 million, a sum
*  many still believe was too low.
*  Traditional farmers, like Roy's grandfather, now found themselves in the daily labor economy
*  for the first time.
*  He went to work at the Navy ship repair facility, painting and reconstructing boats.
*  Those fortunate enough to find employment still faced discrimination.
*  In the Navy itself, locals were only allowed to work as waiters or mess hall attendants.
*  Pay rates for Americans were almost twice that of natives.
*  At the time, Guam's status complicated the military's land taking.
*  It is illegal to seize land that's not within the United States by eminent domain.
*  And so, in 1950, Congress passed the Organic Act, which established Guam as a territory,
*  granted citizenship to inhabitants who traced their ancestry to the 1898 Treaty of Paris,
*  and provided for an appointed governor, an elected legislature, and a judicial branch.
*  Puerto Ricans, colonized in the same Spanish concession as Guam, were granted American
*  citizenship in 1917.
*  Guam remained under federal control.
*  The Navy approved who could or couldn't arrive on the island.
*  It was only in 1968 that Guam was permitted to elect its own governor.
*  The federal government's expansive power over Guam exists because of a series of Supreme
*  Court rulings called the Insular Cases that began in 1901, five years after the Court
*  allowed separate but equal segregation.
*  The U.S. Congress already had plenary power over all American territories under Article
*  IV, Section 3, Clause 2 of the Constitution, referred to as the Territorial Clause.
*  In the Insular Cases, the Court reasoned that certain U.S. territories were inhabited by
*  alien races, so the full Constitution did not have to apply there, and they were not
*  assumed to be on a path to statehood.
*  As a result, any legislation passed by Guam's local government can be overruled by Congress
*  in perpetuity.
*  The island is governed by consultation, not consent.
*  In 1946, eight United Nations member countries, including the United States, created a list
*  of their territories whose people have not yet attained a full measure of self-government,
*  in accordance with the U.N. Charter's Principle of Self-Determination.
*  Guam is among the 17 that remain there today.
*  Delegates from the Guam Decolonization Commission regularly travel to New York to appear before
*  the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization to bring attention to the failure of the self-determination
*  process.
*  Testimony is given by the Guam Delegation, the U.S. Government Delegation, and an independent
*  expert, and results in a draft resolution.
*  Every time the Guam Delegation requests the United States allow a U.N. fact-finding mission
*  to assess the colony's trajectory toward self-determination, the request is denied.
*  It took me three flights and more than 30 hours to travel the 8,000 miles to Guam from
*  New York City.
*  The island's GDP is roughly a third tourism and a third military, so there are basically
*  no business hotels, only beach resorts.
*  In the mornings, my hotel elevator was full of uniformed service members cramming in next
*  to multi-generational Korean families on holiday, grandmothers, parents, and toddlers wearing
*  inflatable life vests and full-length rash guards.
*  Clutching snorkels and sunscreen, they wandered among camouflage and combat boots.
*  Outside the resorts, Guam looks like strip-mall America on military steroids.
*  Fast food and drive-through joints are everywhere.
*  Chain-link fences surround high schools.
*  Sidewalks are few, and there is no functional public transit system.
*  The Seoul Public Hospital is in such poor shape that the Army Corps of Engineers told
*  the governor it would be cheaper just to build a new one.
*  The U.S. military presence across the island has become so normalized that it's part of
*  the fabric of society.
*  Reminders of wars past and present are ubiquitous.
*  Monuments and veterans' cemeteries are around every corner.
*  Chaguyen Massacre Memorial, War in the Pacific National Historical Park, and Meningen Memorial
*  Foundation Peace Park.
*  Signs cautioning pedestrians about unexploded ordnance from World War II are common, and
*  it seems as if everywhere you look there's a military recruitment office of some kind.
*  ROTC is active in high schools and has its own dormitory floor at the University of Guam.
*  Since a third of Guam's land belongs to the Defense Department, it's hard to go
*  anywhere without encountering military fencing or giant radar defense installations that
*  look like white golf balls the size of mansions.
*  Guam is also the site of the new Marine Corps Base Camp Blas, the first Marine base to be
*  activated since 1952.
*  While geopolitical tensions have sharpened Washington's attention on the region, the
*  decision to build Camp Blas had little to do with the current U.S.-China rivalries.
*  In 1995, two Marines and a naval medic abducted a 12-year-old schoolgirl walking home from
*  a stationery store in Okinawa.
*  They threw her into the backseat of a rented car, then taped her mouth, her arms and legs,
*  and her eyes.
*  They drove to an isolated farm road, where they beat and raped her.
*  The incident was far from the first instance of U.S. service member violence against the
*  indigenous people of Okinawa, but its heinousness sparked waves of protests that led the U.S.
*  government to agree to remove a substantial number of troops stationed there since Japan's
*  surrender in World War II.
*  The story of how these troops were moved to Guam and the response of the local community
*  offers a case study in the dynamics that define relations between the military and the islanders.
*  In 2006, Washington and Tokyo announced they had agreed to transfer 8,600 of the 18,000
*  U.S. Marines from Okinawa to Guam.
*  No one asked anyone on Guam how they felt about it.
*  When the Defense Department released an environmental impact statement in 2009, it was over 8,000
*  pages long and allotted 90 days for community comment.
*  It proposed dredging nearly 72 acres of live coral reef, drilling an additional 22 wells
*  into the island's northern aquifer, absorbing even more land, amounting to roughly 42% of
*  the island, increasing the population by 80,000, and constructing a live firing range in Pogget
*  Village, home to a sacred Chamoru cultural and burial site.
*  There was an unprecedented outcry.
*  A group of activists came together under the umbrella of We Are Guahan, the Chamoru name
*  for Guam, and pulled apart every page of the document to create a CliffsNotes version of
*  the plan.
*  They brought illustrated poster boards to town halls to engage the community on the
*  dangers of the expansion.
*  In the end, they solicited 10,000 comments, said to be a Defense Department record.
*  In 2011, We Are Guahan sued the department over the proposed destruction of Pogget, saying
*  the military had not adequately explored other locations for a live firing range.
*  We Are Guahan's lawsuit prompted the Navy to make changes to its plan, a remarkable
*  victory for a small group of indigenous activists facing off with the military that had controlled
*  their island for so long.
*  The following year, the department proposed reducing the number of Marines coming to Guam
*  and moving the training range to La Texin, on a cliff above the site of an ancient Chamoru
*  village, as well as the habitat of the sole remaining endangered Hazan Lagu tree, technically
*  within the military's existing footprint.
*  Today, the construction of Marine Corps base camp laws is nearly completed.
*  It is named after the first Chamoru general, Vicente T. Blas, known as Ben, who went on
*  to become Guam's Republican representative to the House from 1985 to 1993.
*  In a 1991 letter to the editor in the New York Times, Blas deployed a phrase about Guam's
*  political status in America that is repeated as dogma on the island today.
*  Equal in war, unequal in peace.
*  When I visited Camp Blas in December, the controversial fifth and final live firing
*  range on La Texin was proceeding rapidly.
*  The base would bring 5,000 Marines, a third of whom would be coming with their families,
*  with the rest on staggered six-month rotations.
*  The missile defense system would bring in at least another thousand service members.
*  Currently, military personnel and their families number around 22,000, while the civilian population
*  is 154,000, 41% of whom identify as Chamoru.
*  The military pays its troops in Guam a monthly overseas housing allowance, though Guam is
*  not overseas as the word is normally understood, it is part of America.
*  The OHA, which at $2,205 and up, is higher than the domestic allowance, inflates the
*  market and makes apartments impossible for locals to afford.
*  Everyone agrees, Camp Blas will only make the island-wide housing crisis worse.
*  But the U.S. military is not just an outside force occupying the island.
*  Of the 154,000 civilians who live in Guam, an estimated 7,500 are veterans of the armed
*  services, one of the highest rates per capita in the nation, though Guam ranks at the very
*  bottom for veteran services.
*  Roughly 3% of the territory's workforce is in the Guam Army and Air Force National Guard,
*  and when their units were called up and deployed to Afghanistan, every village on the island
*  felt it.
*  So many people are in the service that casualty rates in Guam from the forever wars are four
*  and a half times the national average.
*  Every extended family has at least one member who is a veteran.
*  It's not necessarily love for country that attracts many, it's the benefits.
*  Roughly 17% of the island lives in poverty, compared with a 12% national average, and
*  in any given quarter, according to Lisa Linda Natividad, a professor of social work at the
*  University of Guam, 38 to 42% of Chamorro families are on food stamps.
*  Military recruits are issued IDs that grant them access to multiple bases to buy cheaper
*  groceries.
*  Because of the huge distances and the Jones Act, which restricts transportation of cargo
*  between US ports to US-owned, US-crewed, US-registered, and US-built ships, a gallon of milk in the
*  local supermarket costs $17.
*  A gallon of milk at the commissary on base costs $5.97.
*  There are base-only franchises for cheaper fast food and subsidized gas.
*  Add to this the promise of medical coverage, dental care, and a huge sign-up bonus.
*  As a territory, Guam gets a small fraction of the federal funding a state does.
*  When Congress passed the COVID relief bill, Guam got one-tenth of the minimum amount allotted
*  for a state.
*  Those who live in Guam are not entitled to supplemental security income, what most people
*  call disability.
*  State is currently capped at $137 million.
*  The rest has to come from the territory's budget, unlike in a state where there is no
*  cap.
*  The Defense Department activated camp laws on October 1, 2020.
*  Many are still hoping for the job creation the military touted, though even the pro-buildup
*  members of Guam's Chamber of Commerce admitted to me that it has yet to really materialize.
*  Much of the labor for the base construction was done by H2B visa workers.
*  Anecdotally, a large portion of Guam's population supports the buildup, but even many in this
*  camp seem nervous, concerned over adding so many people to an already overwhelmed island.
*  Are we going to flip over?
*  One woman asked me, not entirely joking.
*  You've seen this island.
*  Where will the cars go?
*  Where will we go?
*  Civil-military relations are already low.
*  Everywhere I went during my time on the island was totally segregated.
*  From dinner at California Pizza Kitchen to a U.S. fish and wildlife sponsored tent by
*  the beach inviting kids to weave and paint plants.
*  Military are supposed to receive a cultural training session when they arrive, but multiple
*  service members I spoke to didn't remember taking one.
*  The ones who did didn't seem to have been given much of a primer on Guam's history,
*  status, or Chamoru culture.
*  When I asked about places where locals and the military mingled, people thought about
*  it a while and directed me to strip clubs and church.
*  Like many on the island, Roy grew up and joined the military.
*  With special permission from his parents, he enlisted in the Guam Army National Guard
*  Reserves at 17.
*  I was just a dumb kid, he told me.
*  I wanted to get out of my mother's house.
*  When he arrived at basic training in Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri in 1994, his fellow
*  recruits asked him questions he wasn't expecting.
*  Where the hell is Guam?
*  Is that like near Guatemala?
*  Yeah, in the dictionary, he would reply.
*  Damn, bro, you speak really good English.
*  Thanks, I learned it two months ago.
*  Do you all live in huts?
*  Other Pacific Islanders would share stories about the ignorant things they heard and
*  how they replied, telling their peers that they were chiefs or princes back home.
*  And that their people rode them from Guam to Hawaii in order to catch the flight to
*  basic training.
*  Pacific Islanders and those from other US territories stuck together.
*  They had to develop a sense of humor about these things, but
*  other daily indignities graded.
*  It wasn't just the inability to vote for the commander in chief they served, but
*  how the military designated voting rep walked around handing out absentee ballots,
*  shouting, all right, New York, here's your absentee ballot.
*  New Jersey, here you go.
*  Guam, no.
*  Puerto Rico, no.
*  Virgin Islands, nope.
*  After September 11th, Roy watched the coverage endlessly.
*  He was angry.
*  He was patriotic.
*  Or perhaps he just wanted to put his training to use.
*  Maybe it was bravado and machismo, but I wanted to see what war was like,
*  he told me.
*  I wanted to fight and defend my country.
*  I felt personally ticked off that someone had attacked the United States.
*  Roy watched as the Guam Army National Guards units remained stationary.
*  I kept asking the National Guard unit, are we going to deploy?
*  Is this unit going to deploy?
*  When Roy couldn't get a straight answer, he decided to join the Marines.
*  He was sure they would see combat.
*  When he got to Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, he was 27,
*  older than most of his drill instructors.
*  At Camp Lejeune, Roy met a soldier named Michael Franquez, and
*  the two quickly became friends.
*  Michael carried a Guam flag with him during his deployments to Iraq,
*  tucked inside his flak jacket as a talisman.
*  When Roy's turn came to deploy to Fallujah, Michael gave him the flag.
*  Keep it folded.
*  Keep it inside your flak vest.
*  It'll keep you safe, Michael told him.
*  Michael had written his own name and deployment dates on it.
*  When he got to Iraq, Roy tucked the flag into his vest and carried it everywhere.
*  It was there when his Humvee crashed into a HESCO barrier.
*  Roy smashed his face and then his whole body followed,
*  right into the front windshield.
*  He suffered a concussion.
*  At the base hospital, they saw that his spinal cord was swollen and
*  called for a medevac.
*  The base was under attack, and no helicopters could fly in or out.
*  When Roy finally came to, the doctors told him they had not been sure he was
*  going to make it, that it was a miracle he survived.
*  The flag made it through unscathed.
*  The doctors told Roy that if he had an MRI, he could be medically discharged.
*  But they needed every body, so Roy decided he would push through and
*  see out his deployment.
*  When Roy finally came back to Camp Lejeune,
*  he signed the flag and gave it back to Michael.
*  After Michael did another tour, he gave it back to Roy, who took it with him when
*  he deployed to Ramadi in central Iraq in 2007,
*  as a sergeant in supply and logistics in the infantry.
*  Roy's unit traveled from outpost to outpost.
*  From his arrival until the time they secured the city,
*  12 members of his unit were killed.
*  The war was so much more brutal and futile than Roy had imagined.
*  Liberation so different than what was commemorated in the parades
*  down Marine Corps Drive of his youth.
*  There was no celebrating the arriving American soldiers.
*  Roy had started to wonder what the mission was meant to accomplish.
*  Did any of these people even want them there?
*  He was no longer focused on fighting for country, but
*  more on his brothers to his left and his right.
*  When Roy's contract was unilaterally extended for three months, he was furious.
*  In a fit of anger, he took the Guam flag out of his vest and
*  ran it up a makeshift flagpole outside his hooch, 20 feet into the sky,
*  violating military policy.
*  That night, post-it notes from islanders from Guam,
*  Saipan, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico appeared on his door.
*  Roy organized a meetup, and they got a burn barrel,
*  put a stainless steel grill on top of it, and
*  decided they were going to barbecue as they did at home.
*  The first time they met, nobody came empty-handed.
*  The island custom is to bring something, drinks, chips, canned spam.
*  It turned into a weekly gathering,
*  the one thing that got Roy through those last few months.
*  When Roy returned to Guam in 2008, he got a job in sales and
*  rose through the ranks to become a manager.
*  But it was hard to adjust to civilian life.
*  His greatest struggle was with mental health.
*  Roy's thoughts scared him.
*  Ideas of harming others would just pop into his mind out of the blue.
*  He could be having a perfectly fine day, and a thought would come in like, hey,
*  there's this stupid dude on the side of the road.
*  I could just run him over with my damn truck.
*  He didn't know what to do.
*  Roy's unit lost 16 men during their deployments, but
*  they lost more to suicide after they came home.
*  Roy would check their Facebook groups and
*  see their unit crest with a black stripe across it, and immediately he knew.
*  Who did we lose today?
*  Why did we lose them today?
*  Roy had been older than many of them.
*  Kids who were just starting to figure out their lives used as cannon fodder for
*  the broader goals of empire Roy couldn't even rationalize anymore.
*  He flew to all the funerals.
*  In 2010, mental health care on Guam for PTSD was non-existent.
*  The closest Veterans Affairs Medical Center was in Hawaii, 4,000 miles away.
*  So getting set up for services and receiving specialized care was a nightmare.
*  It took a few months for Roy even to get a referral for treatment.
*  When he saw his first VA psychologist,
*  it was on a video conference call with someone in Hawaii.
*  It was too impersonal, too weird, and Roy never called back.
*  The disproportionate lack of VA services in the territories is well documented.
*  In 2020, the Center for a New American Security found that while the average
*  state offered 36 distinct benefits to veterans and military families, and
*  the highest offered 60, Guam offered 14.
*  Together, the territories averaged 11 benefits.
*  Veterans in the US territories are a largely forgotten and unsupported population,
*  despite high rates of service that outpace many US states, the report's authors wrote.
*  We've had many veterans from Guam leave their homeland because they've heard
*  stories of it's better in California, it's better in Washington,
*  it's better in Texas, Roy explained.
*  It's not just dearth of services.
*  Guam's VA system is also wracked with delays.
*  A week after Roy had a heart attack, the community-based outpatient system still
*  hadn't processed his referral to a cardiologist in Hawaii.
*  He didn't want to wait, so he paid for his own ticket to get there.
*  Many other veterans would not be able to afford the expensive flight.
*  So many veterans just don't even ask for the support they need, Roy said.
*  They don't want to admit to being what they see as weak, and
*  when they do, it's so hard to get services, they often just give up.
*  He knew because he had been the same way.
*  After several attempts at mental health support,
*  he decided he didn't want to have anything to do with the VA setup.
*  But he was dealing with a lot, stress, anxiety, PTSD,
*  some battles on the home front, he felt isolated.
*  A friend of his suggested he talk to John Conception.
*  John had served in the Guam Army National Guard and
*  had completed a deployment to Afghanistan.
*  They had some similar experiences, and once they began talking,
*  they just understood.
*  They started trying to keep tabs on each other.
*  How are you doing, man?
*  It's been a rough week.
*  Okay, I'll come up.
*  Hang out.
*  As time went on, John started to call Roy about other people.
*  Hey man, do you think you want to help me out?
*  He would ask.
*  This person called and told me that he's on the verge of pulling the trigger.
*  The two men would drive out together without really knowing the right thing to
*  say or do, but it kept happening.
*  So many veterans were in need of care.
*  John and Roy would just visit with them, the ones who were telling them,
*  I'm ready to hang myself, or I've got a pistol in my hand, or
*  I'm sitting on my roof ready to jump.
*  They kept in touch.
*  When the island emerged from lockdown in January 2021, John, Roy, and
*  another veteran organized their first in-person group meeting.
*  They called it the Battle Buddy Talk, and 25 veterans gathered.
*  They decided to officially establish the group as an NGO,
*  which they named Got Your 671.
*  671 is Guam's area code.
*  John became president, and Roy became vice president.
*  The protests against camp laws had resurfaced longstanding divisions in
*  the community, where families are large and everyone knows everyone or
*  is somehow related.
*  Arguments among friends and family had grown atypically heated.
*  Some took the anti-buildup sentiment personally as targeting their own family
*  members in the service.
*  They believed Guam needed more American military for
*  defense during this time of turbulence, not less.
*  Others argued the Chamoru culture of hospitality was being taken advantage of
*  again.
*  Roy and John were approached by Roman de la Cruz,
*  Chamoru cultural advocate and president of the Atsu Marianas,
*  a traditional slingstone throwing organization, who heard about Got Your 671
*  and invited them to hold their weekly meetings at the Sagan Katorin Chamoru,
*  a cultural center that hosts traditional artists, bakers, healers, and seafarers.
*  The buildup was happening whether the community liked it or not, and
*  Roman thought having the veterans as a bridge between the activists and
*  the arriving Marines could have its advantages.
*  But first, they needed to repair relations within the community.
*  The veterans are in a very unique situation,
*  where they can communicate with both sides, Roman told me.
*  They are going to play a very critical part as things surge forward.
*  He saw the veterans as descendants of the ancient Chamoru war fighters,
*  who had taken on the Spanish conquistadors with slings in hundreds of
*  sail-powered outrigger canoes, circling them at two to three times their speed.
*  Atsu Marianas was revitalizing Chamoru slinging,
*  competing at tournaments around the world.
*  Roman offered to teach Got Your 671 members how to sling, and Roy and
*  John offered to teach Atsu Marianas members some jungle warfare tactics.
*  But when the veterans showed up, Roman was the only one who talked to them.
*  Sometimes wearing that uniform can carry some kind of a negative connotation,
*  Roy explained, because islanders look at it as,
*  you went over to the patriotic American side, and you're not local anymore.
*  All you are is a Marine, all you are is a veteran.
*  Over the next couple of weeks, the veterans won the Atsu Marianas over.
*  They spoke the same language, enjoyed the same food, and
*  liked one another's company.
*  Eventually, Roy and John realized that the sound of balls and
*  stones hitting target posts was triggering for many veterans.
*  So the group got permission to move a bit farther up the hill,
*  where there was a derelict 40-foot container.
*  They painted it green, built a cement and wooden deck, and
*  strung up a retractable tarp roof for shade.
*  It became their home base.
*  Got Your 671 also runs a monthly meeting called Social Grounds,
*  where the group rents out a cafe and
*  gets veterans and their families to sit together for an activity.
*  During the session I went to, three dozen attendees were building model cars.
*  I had come straight from Warrior Day,
*  an all-day recruitment event held by the Guam National Guard.
*  About two dozen high school juniors and seniors gathered in the National Guard
*  base that morning, getting a sign-up pitch to perform drills for two days a month
*  in exchange for dental care, scholarship money, and cheaper food and gas.
*  Not just for themselves, but also their parents and grandparents.
*  They got matching t-shirts, crawled through an inflatable obstacle course,
*  and shot simulation rifles at a wall-size screen.
*  Driving from young, lithe, fresh recruits to struggling,
*  injured veterans, felt like twisted time travel.
*  A discomforting feeling made more urgent on an island that would be the first to
*  see destruction, and among people who would be first to see deployment
*  in the event of a war.
*  When I mentioned this to Roy, he nodded.
*  This is why we are doing this, he told me quietly,
*  for things to be better for him when he gets out.
*  He was looking at his son, Roy Jr.
*  The nine-year-old was absorbed in building a model.
*  Roy Jr. was serious, dressed in a green shirt, neatly tucked into camouflage pants,
*  and spouted military history and terminology.
*  Roy told me he didn't want his son to enlist.
*  He would prefer for his kids to stay out of the services completely.
*  But he recognized there was nothing that drew a child towards something more
*  strongly than a parent's disapproval.
*  So he was trying to be supportive, talking to his son about naval officer school.
*  I asked Roy what role he thought Guam's status played in their struggles for
*  better care.
*  It has everything to do with our status, he replied.
*  The people of Guam are only important when there's threats from China,
*  when there's threats from Korea.
*  But we're such a small number.
*  We're the pawn in the global scheme of things.
*  For nearly eight decades since it was placed on the UN's decolonization list,
*  Guam had been waiting for a resolution to its political status.
*  When I asked what he wanted for Guam's future, Roy, who was so
*  clear and emphatic about the situation for veterans, grew vague.
*  He listed the benefits of statehood, then independence, and
*  ended up in the middle again.
*  Talking about political status was a difficult topic for many in Guam.
*  So I turned off my recorder and
*  asked whether he was comfortable telling me what he really believed.
*  Roy said he'd think about it and get back to me.
*  Across the Pacific,
*  the US military has been fighting for
*  the rights of the people of Guam.
*  Across the Pacific, the US military has adopted the Agile Combat Employment
*  Doctrine, a way to move forces around to confuse an enemy and
*  avoid concentrating forces in one place.
*  Guam would be the catapult, as Esther Sablan,
*  an executive director at Anderson, put it when I visited.
*  A place from which, in the event of war, allied forces would spring toward China
*  through other islands, like stepping stones.
*  What we don't want to do is have to build bases all over the place.
*  Rear Admiral Benjamin Nicholson,
*  commander of Joint Region Marianas at the time, told me.
*  Because we have a main hub here in Guam, if we need to flow forces to another area
*  because that's where the threat is, then we can quickly flow there.
*  If we've already set everything up, that gives us the ability to be very agile.
*  And so, it would be from the Northern Mariana Islands,
*  a 14-island archipelago north of Guam, and other US-affiliated states
*  across the Pacific that the theoretical war with China would be waged.
*  At the airport in Saipan, the capital of the Northern Marianas, my bags and
*  I were weighed together on a giant scale and cleared to fly 15.5 miles to Tinian.
*  The first location of the Pentagon's plan to expand infrastructure on US-
*  affiliated islands across the Pacific to become forward operating sites,
*  which contain pre-positioned supplies for war fighting, but
*  which the US government doesn't technically classify as a base.
*  In the cockpit of a star Marianas Air Piper PA-32-300 Cherokee 6,
*  the controls looked straight out of an old arcade game.
*  And it was so hot, the pilot left my passenger door open as we taxied to
*  the runway.
*  We rose slowly, the propellers spinning as the ocean water churned below.
*  The tiny plane banked right and then left,
*  straight into a cloud with no visibility inside the gray.
*  Emerging from the mist, we could see Northfield,
*  the site of several runways on the north of Tinian built during World War II,
*  from which two American planes took off to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
*  From behind me, over the din of the propeller, Debra Fleming,
*  a community historian and my host on Tinian, beckoned me to look left.
*  In the middle of jungle,
*  tractors and bright red earth emerged violently from Tinian's emerald green.
*  The construction of the Divert Airfield,
*  a facility being built as a place to divert planes in the case of an attack on
*  Anderson Airfield, its existence a testament to expectations around
*  Guam's vulnerability, was well underway.
*  The present day Northern Marianas were conquered first by the Spanish,
*  who sold them to the Germans, who lost them to the Japanese.
*  On December 7th, 1941, just hours after bombing Pearl Harbor,
*  Japanese planes taking off from Saipan bombed Guam.
*  Because the Northern Marianas and
*  Guam are over the international dateline, the date was December 8th there.
*  When Guam capitulated two days later, the Japanese administered the island with
*  the help of Chamorro translators from Saipan and a neighboring island called Rota.
*  As a result, a rift opened within the indigenous group that continues to cleave
*  them today.
*  Though they are the same people, Chamorro on Guam and
*  Chamorro in the Northern Mariana Islands spell the same word differently.
*  In Guam, it's spelled capital C, capital H, lowercase a-m-o-r-u.
*  And in the Commonwealth, it's spelled capital C, lowercase h, a-m-o-r-r-o.
*  After Allied victory, Japan's entire Pacific Island Empire was placed into
*  a trust of roughly 100 inhabited islands spread out over an area the size of
*  the contiguous United States to be administered by Washington.
*  Which was charged to promote the development of the inhabitants of
*  the trust territory towards self-government or independence.
*  This included the present day Northern Marianas, Micronesia,
*  the Marshall Islands, and Palau.
*  Saipan eventually became the headquarters of the trust,
*  which was administered first by the Navy and then the Department of the Interior.
*  And which arbitrarily divided the islands into six districts,
*  with each one voting to decide its fate.
*  The Commonwealth's founding fathers, as the group of legislators are known,
*  wrote the Covenant, a governing document that outlined the archipelago's
*  right to control its internal matters, while granting the US federal government
*  sovereignty over the Northern Marianas' foreign affairs and defense.
*  The Covenant specified which articles of the US Constitution applied.
*  And fundamental changes to the document can be made only by mutual consent
*  between the Northern Marianas and Congress.
*  The Northern Marianas have the right to call for
*  direct negotiations with the federal government on specific issues.
*  This arrangement was made possible by the Insular Cases.
*  In 1975, 75% of Northern Marianas residents voted to adopt the document.
*  They also voted repeatedly to integrate with Guam, but Guam rejected the proposal.
*  Northern Marianas residents are now US citizens without federal voting rights.
*  They serve in the US Armed Forces, but do not have their own VA office.
*  As part of the negotiations, the US government leased two-thirds of
*  the land on Tinian for 50 years to build a military base,
*  saying that it would provide a boost to the economy, and
*  also promising to build a school and provide medical services.
*  Residents are still waiting.
*  Today, the 40-square-mile island, home to 2,000 people,
*  has no hospital or dentist, one gas station,
*  one semi-functional ATM, and a few small grocery stores.
*  The main employer is the mayor's office.
*  In a 2010 census, 44% of the households on Tinian fell below the poverty line.
*  When the American military took Tinian from the Japanese during World War II,
*  they laid out roads in the same manner as Manhattan,
*  with Broadway, Wall Street, 86th, 42nd, and so on.
*  That morning, Fleming took me to Northfield,
*  where American service members built the largest airport in the world at the time,
*  from which planes took off every three minutes during the last year of the war.
*  We drove up Broadway to the two bombing pits that were used to load
*  nuclear weapons into planes, now encased in glass like a mausoleum of the grotesque.
*  Atomic bomb pit number one loaded the five-ton uranium bomb, little boy,
*  that killed over 100,000 people in one morning explosion.
*  Atomic bomb pit number two contained the plutonium bomb,
*  fat man, that instantly killed 40,000 people in Nagasaki.
*  Standing at the glass, the duality of past destruction,
*  overlaid with the prospect of the future decimation that would require use of
*  the divert airfield, felt like vertigo.
*  The thousands of troops relocating from Okinawa to Camp Blas would need places to
*  train, so the Defense Department decided to use the land they had leased for
*  a base on Tinian to create what they called the CNMI Joint Military Training Facility.
*  The 2015 blueprint included ripping out a reef to practice amphibious landings,
*  high hazard impact training, shooting and bombing,
*  ship to shore launches using howitzers, and
*  live bombing a smaller island just north of Tinian called Pagan Island.
*  There would be no permanently stationed troops, no base.
*  Just destruction.
*  The department's plans were so outrageous that there was a huge backlash.
*  Guam gets 10,000 troops and the promise of a military economy that comes with it,
*  and Tinian gets bullets and bombs?
*  Tinian is generally very accepting of military training, but
*  that was the time everyone came out and said, hell no, said Kimberlin King Hines,
*  the Commonwealth Ports Authority Chairwoman and local council for
*  the community groups that sued the US military over the plan.
*  Deborah Fleming was the spokeswoman for one of the groups.
*  They lost, so they pressured local leadership to take up the issue.
*  The governor and the mayor got involved.
*  Negotiations over the scope of the training grounds continue.
*  There's just a lot of people who think they can come to these islands and
*  just get away with saying whatever and doing whatever, King Hines told me.
*  She described an encounter at the Tinian Mayor's office with 20 military personnel,
*  including a lawyer from the Pentagon, with whom she ended up in a bitter argument.
*  I just cursed them out.
*  I don't give a **** who you think you are.
*  I don't know what **** rights you think you have here.
*  You know what they did?
*  They sent the FBI to investigate whether I was a potential domestic terrorist.
*  So there's an FBI agent who's going around the community asking everyone,
*  do I have propensity for violence?
*  The Navy and FBI did not respond to requests for comment.
*  Still, the conversations I had about the military buildup in the Northern Mariana's
*  felt different from those I had in Guam.
*  In the Northern Mariana's, people were demanding their rights.
*  They expected to be heard.
*  The difference between Guam and us, we chose to be in political union with
*  the United States, and so when we enter into the agreement,
*  we willingly leased two-thirds of Tinian for these purposes, King Hines told me.
*  Whereas Guam, they became a part of the American family as a spoil of war.
*  Yet, in practice, the Northern Marianas has lost every important court case when
*  it comes to gray areas in the Covenant's separation of powers.
*  They lost control over immigration after a series of scandals over sweatshops,
*  clothing companies that came in to make made in USA labeled clothes,
*  but paid workers pennies.
*  In 2005, they lost their claim to 200 nautical miles off their coast.
*  The United States has since transferred three miles back.
*  They also lost the right to submerged properties,
*  all lands below the high water line.
*  People I spoke to there were surprised by the ruling, because in the view of
*  the indigenous people in the region, land and
*  water make up the same continuous territory.
*  So it hadn't even occurred to them it would be a cause for negotiation.
*  The biggest legal loss was perhaps over the protection of indigenous land rights.
*  Currently, all land that is not privately held belongs to the native
*  inhabitants of the Northern Mariana Islands,
*  an arrangement made possible by the insular cases.
*  But as native Chamoru and native Carolinians, a group that migrated from
*  present-day Micronesia and Palau in the 19th century, are outnumbered by new
*  arrivals, the Northern Marianas amended its constitution to ensure any future
*  vote on changing land ownership could only be made by these two groups.
*  It was struck down as being a race-based voting classification.
*  When the federal government saw fit, the authorities took what they wanted.
*  The whole setup seemed like another version of colonialism in a slightly more
*  modern outfit.
*  You could certainly make a case that it's all a sham.
*  It's all bull**** that they just pull the wool over the eyes of the United Nations,
*  of the Marianas, of the whole world.
*  Joseph Horry, who argued many of the cases on behalf of plaintiffs from the
*  Northern Marianas, told me, but the problem with it is if that's true,
*  what do we do?
*  It's a never-ending battle to make the covenant protections real and
*  to govern themselves rather than be governed by Congress,
*  be governed by the states, be governed by the military,
*  be governed by someone far, far away who thinks they know what's best or
*  what's right or what's enlightened.
*  Hundreds of miles to the east and west of Guam,
*  a thousand islands and atolls make up Palau, the Marshall Islands, and Micronesia.
*  Their 200,000 citizens caught in a vortex of geopolitical competition between
*  the United States and China.
*  The three countries elect their own governments, craft their own foreign
*  policy, and have votes in the United Nations.
*  But they are deeply intertwined with the United States and
*  integral to the maintenance of American security and overseas empire.
*  The US military has at least three construction projects breaking ground in
*  Micronesia, worth $432 million in total.
*  In Palau, the Defense Department is building a high frequency radar system and
*  expanding a port and an airport, projects worth at least $121 million.
*  The United States already operates a missile defense base in the Marshall Islands.
*  The unique political relationship of these three countries to the United States
*  is called free association.
*  Each country granted the United States the prerogative to operate military bases
*  from their territories and to deny use of their land, air, and sea to any country
*  that is seen as a threat to American national security.
*  In exchange, the United States agreed to provide each country with security
*  guarantees and the right for its citizens to reside and
*  work in the US without a visa in perpetuity.
*  This part of the compact of free association, COFA agreements,
*  is immutable, subject to termination only by mutual agreement.
*  As a result, citizens of the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and
*  Palau serve in the US armed forces, though their access to VA
*  benefits is even more difficult than from Guam or the Northern Marianas.
*  But as the United States takes renewed interest in the region,
*  the realities of the poverty there and America's direct culpability in it
*  are inescapable.
*  Both the Marshall Islands and Micronesia are poor, aid-dependent economies.
*  They rank in the bottom third of all the countries on the UN's Human Development
*  Index.
*  Palau, held up by many I met in the Pacific to be the success case of
*  the region, ranks significantly higher on all counts.
*  Corruption is rampant.
*  Transparency International Polling found that 61% of people in Micronesia using
*  a public service have paid a bribe.
*  58% have been offered money in exchange for their vote.
*  It was not supposed to be this way.
*  These countries were in the same US administered Pacific Trust territory as
*  the Northern Marianas.
*  After nearly four decades of American stewardship,
*  all three voted for the status of freely associated states,
*  a term that created a political arrangement that did not previously exist.
*  The compacts signed by each newly established country included a round of
*  economic assistance, initially set to expire in 2003,
*  that was extended for another 20 years.
*  The second and supposedly final round created trust funds intended to be built
*  up through joint contributions that would provide future government revenue.
*  For years, the countries cautioned they needed a third round of funding.
*  But successive US administrations brushed them off.
*  That changed abruptly in 2019,
*  when Beijing announced something that it had never done before.
*  It gave a $2 million contribution to the Micronesian Compact Trust Fund.
*  Three weeks later, Mike Pompeo, the Secretary of State at the time,
*  announced Washington was ready to negotiate.
*  The response was so incredibly obvious.
*  Giff Johnson, editor of the Marshall Islands Journal,
*  told me in Majuro, the country's capital, the Chinese play a long game.
*  They're very deliberate, and
*  you can see the progression from the 80s and 90s, the diplomacy.
*  Whereas the Americans are every four years around the cycle of
*  the presidential election checking to see what's going on.
*  If nothing's going on, the Pacific is just considered to be an American place and
*  that everything's under control.
*  But now, suddenly, it's not.
*  And so that's elevated the interest level.
*  Beijing's outreach since the 1990s has been anchored in economics.
*  By 2019, the PRC had established itself as the second largest lender to
*  the Pacific Island states.
*  The previous year, China surpassed Australia to become their largest
*  trading partner.
*  It is also the largest destination for regional exports,
*  like minerals, fish, and timber.
*  Chinese foreign assistance in Micronesia was everywhere when I visited
*  the island Pompeii last winter.
*  The PRC funded a road project on the island and
*  built the Pompeii State Administrative Building and
*  the Tuna Commission Building.
*  In Colonial Village in Pompeii, a green sheet metal covered
*  the basketball court proclaimed itself the Colonial China Friendship Center
*  in huge white letters.
*  Around the corner, I saw a sign for the Micronesia China Friendship Association.
*  But every time I walked by it, the door was locked.
*  When I asked a group of students doing a bake sale next to the basketball court,
*  they said they had never seen anyone there.
*  The Marshall Islands and Palau receive aid from Taiwan.
*  They are among the 13 countries, including the Vatican,
*  that have diplomatic relations with Taipei.
*  Micronesia has diplomatic relations with the PRC.
*  The skirmishing for influence has reached almost comical proportions.
*  In Micronesia, both the United States and
*  China jockeyed to put their names on big projects.
*  But neither seemed particularly interested in funding ongoing maintenance.
*  As a result, large construction projects that presumably sounded great on paper
*  often sat damaged or empty.
*  The PRC-built government building had holes in the ceiling where I could see
*  the rafters and loose wires dangling out.
*  I heard a story from Steven Finnan, former Rotary President in Pompeii,
*  about US Navy Seabees putting a new roof on the public library.
*  They took off half the old roof before they went to the hardware store and
*  learned it would take six weeks to ship the replacement sheets.
*  So the library had no roof, Finnan told me.
*  New schools were built with similar ignorance of daily realities in the region,
*  with, for instance, air conditioning hookups instead of traditional slatted
*  window louvers.
*  It's like somebody said, this is a hot place.
*  You're going to use air conditioning all the time, Finnan explained.
*  But the education department can't afford to pay for the AC.
*  Competition with China is the lens that we look at the region through.
*  But that's not the lens that a lot of Pacific Islanders want to solely look at
*  their own engagement with the US through, said Michael Walsh,
*  a researcher at Georgetown University who served as the chair of the Asian and
*  Pacific Security Affairs Subcommittee of the Biden campaign during the 2020
*  presidential election.
*  They understand what our motivation is in increasing engagement with the region,
*  and they're willing to instrumentalize that.
*  But the problem with all of this is it's not responding to the needs of the people.
*  It hasn't over decades.
*  The Biden administration's September 2022 Pacific Partnership Strategy promised
*  to appoint the first US envoy to the Pacific Island Forum, a regional block,
*  increase economic support, and help combat climate change,
*  a crucial area of concern given the delicate ecology and
*  rising sea levels affecting the region.
*  A frenzy of diplomatic overtures preceded the announcement.
*  In February, Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Fiji,
*  the first such visit in three decades.
*  In April, the Solomon Islands signed a security agreement with Beijing, and
*  Washington expressed concerns that China would open a base there.
*  In July, Vice President Kamala Harris gave a virtual address at the PIF,
*  in which she announced plans to open new embassies, return the Peace Corps,
*  and increase funding to the Forum Fisheries Agency.
*  Finally, in September,
*  President Biden hosted the leaders of Pacific Island countries for
*  a first ever White House summit.
*  In May 2023, Biden canceled what would have been a much anticipated historic
*  first US presidential visit to the region to deal with the debt ceiling crisis.
*  But invited the PIF countries back for a second White House summit later in the year.
*  Blinken went to Papua New Guinea in Biden's place and
*  witnessed the signing of the third round of COFA funding with Palau.
*  Micronesia signed the next day.
*  As the United States asserts itself more and more as a Pacific nation,
*  as the Pacific Island National Security Strategy proclaimed,
*  it raises the question of what exactly America is trying to achieve.
*  It's really important to step back as we start to use this term,
*  Pacific homeland, and ask what's the intent of using it?
*  Walsh says, what are we trying to communicate and what are we trying to assert?
*  The US government often misrefers to the freely associated states as part of
*  the American homeland.
*  Are these mistakes, or is there intent behind it?
*  From the bay, the Marshall Islands capital atoll,
*  Majuro, shimmers low off the water.
*  The patches of palm trees, a few tall buildings and
*  a slim bridge rise above the placid aqua blue, as if balanced on nothing at all.
*  The atoll is ten feet above sea level and so
*  narrow that from the fifth floor of one of the few multi-floor buildings,
*  I could see the ocean from both sides.
*  More than 650 miles east of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, 29 atolls and
*  five islands running in two almost parallel chains halfway between Hawaii and
*  Australia, presents a different kind of challenge to America's renewed effort for
*  hearts and minds.
*  In the Marshall Islands, negotiations over the third compact funding round
*  continue because of disagreement over the legacy of US nuclear testing and
*  responsibilities related to it.
*  During the trusteeship period, the United States conducted so
*  much nuclear testing over the atolls of Bikini and
*  Ennui-Toc that it was akin to 1.6 Hiroshima explosions every day for a dozen years.
*  The Castle Bravo test was so big, it could be seen from Okinawa.
*  The ash settled on nearby populated atolls.
*  The US government later took the opportunity to study those that it resettled.
*  They are more like us than the mice, an official with the Atomic Energy Commission
*  explained.
*  Later, the United States took the radioactive waste from nuclear testing in
*  the area, reportedly added 130 tons of soil from an irradiated Nevada nuclear
*  testing site and buried it in a giant dome on Ennui-Toc.
*  The dome is currently at risk of collapsing from rising sea levels.
*  When the Marshallese government appealed for help to seal it, Washington refused.
*  The Marshall Islands is also home to one of the world's largest lagoons,
*  Kwajalein Atoll, which is itself a cautionary tale of participating in
*  America's military ambitions.
*  The Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site was formalized during
*  the negotiations in the original compact, when the US military leased the land
*  from traditional landowners.
*  Kwajalein now supports US missile and missile defense testing,
*  space launches, and space surveillance.
*  When the US military wants to test whether a missile can fly from California to
*  China or North Korea, they shoot it at Kwajalein.
*  The entire island is a military zone, home to roughly 1,300 American military
*  service members, contractors, and scientists, and their families.
*  As a result of the base construction,
*  Marshallese residents of Kwajalein were moved to a nearby island, Ibai.
*  Rounds of missile testing and live fire training by US troops
*  caused the relocation of additional nearby atolls.
*  More and more people were crammed onto Ibai,
*  which is now among the most densely populated places on Earth.
*  15,000 people, half of whom are children, live on 80 acres,
*  less than one-tenth the size of Central Park,
*  with 20 to 30 family members sharing a single house.
*  Chui Lin, a Taiwanese Marshallese journalist who has spent time on Ibai,
*  told me of how, early into his visit there, he wondered why he saw so
*  many teenagers walking around in the middle of the night.
*  Lin thought they were just out having fun.
*  But I realized that's not the issue.
*  It's that they take turns to sleep.
*  Roughly 1,000 Marshallese work on Kwajalein.
*  Every morning, they crowd onto a barge that takes them there, and
*  then back in the evening.
*  On the base, Marshallese laborers do menial work.
*  They complain of poor treatment by on-base security as they come on and off,
*  subjected to dehumanizing searches and
*  questioning about themselves and their personal items.
*  David Paul, a senator representing Kwajalein,
*  told me how a guard once asked to inspect his water bottle,
*  applying him with suspicion for smuggling he didn't even know what,
*  alcohol, explosive substances, onto the base.
*  They think that we're in Kabul or Baghdad or
*  any other very challenging region of the world.
*  But we're in the Marshall Islands, Paul said.
*  We're being treated like we're the enemy, rather than friends and
*  close partners.
*  I asked Paul if, after all these decades,
*  he felt the deal negotiated between America and
*  its ward to lease their island for target practice was really fair.
*  Can it improve, he said?
*  Of course.
*  What is really the true value of them using the Marshall Islands for
*  missile testing programs to advance national security?
*  For the United States to remain the monolithic superpower,
*  compared to what the locals are getting in exchange for their land.
*  One afternoon in Saipan, I went out on a traditional Chamoru canoe,
*  an outrigger with a sail, a hull for the navigators, and
*  a plank over the crossbeams for the passengers.
*  Steered by one navigator and two voyagers from 500 sails,
*  an NGO that is reviving maritime traditions of the Mariana Islands.
*  The ocean was clear and quiet, the waves barely discernible in the silence.
*  Someone spotted a sea turtle.
*  From afar, we could see the Imperial Pacific Hotel and
*  Casino jutting out of the trees.
*  The Imperial is by far the biggest structure on Saipan.
*  The white marble rimmed with gold ornaments looks as if it fell from
*  another dimension next to the downtown district's squat cement buildings.
*  Golden dolphins dance atop fountains at the entrance, while eggs the size of
*  cars stand under gilded suspended dragons in the hall below.
*  Part of a 2014 $7 billion development by a Chinese owned company,
*  at its peak, the operation was somehow turning over more per
*  table bets than any casino in Las Vegas or Macau.
*  In 2020, federal prosecutors opened charges against the company for
*  employing undocumented workers, illegal money transfers, and criminal conspiracy.
*  The company owes at least $100 million in taxes and regulatory fees.
*  Today, the casino stands empty.
*  Its future murky.
*  Residents told me they don't think the government has enough money to
*  deconstruct it safely.
*  On the other side of us, farther out at sea,
*  past the reef that rings the sandy bay, loomed three gargantuan American
*  merchant marine ships full of war supplies.
*  They can be seen from every point on the western side of the island.
*  From the canoe, the picture emerging across the impoverished region seemed almost
*  cartoonish, no matter their status.
*  The Pacific Islands were essentially trapped,
*  forced to choose between Chinese casinos and the US military.
*  On my six week trip around the Pacific,
*  none of the political alliances I saw seemed to serve the local people
*  on whose behalf they supposedly had been crafted.
*  There did not seem to be a clear strategy of regional development.
*  And in the steady drumbeat toward war, the basic tenets of democracy in
*  the Pacific continued fraying, contributing to a legacy of broken promises and
*  distrust.
*  What made it worse was not simply a lack of solutions to their problems, but
*  the metropoles' ignorance of the existence of the problem itself.
*  Debate over the exploitative nature of America's founding history and
*  the country's behavior overseas are now frequent in the US public discourse.
*  But there is no mention of Guam and
*  the vestiges of American empire that continue in the Pacific.
*  Biden's new Pacific strategy claimed to be built to defend sovereignty and
*  freedom, yet its fulcrum was the least enfranchised place in the nation.
*  The free and open Indo-Pacific is like this new paradigmatic shift against China.
*  Kenneth Goffigan Cooper,
*  a professor of political science at the University of Guam, told me,
*  all geopolitical roads in this region lead to Guam.
*  We're the Rome of the Pacific.
*  We are the price of a free and open Pacific.
*  But Guam is not free.
*  In two referendums in 1982, the people of Guam voted to become a US Commonwealth,
*  like the Northern Marianas, but legislation to change the status
*  stalled in Congress.
*  In 1997, the Guam legislature passed a law that established the Guam Commission on
*  Decolonization and called for another plebiscite.
*  The choices were statehood, independence, or free association.
*  Voting was restricted to the Chamorro people,
*  who were defined as all inhabitants of Guam in 1898 and their descendants.
*  C-H-A-M-O-R-R-O is the spelling Guam adhered to before 2018.
*  Three years later, the plebiscite law was amended
*  to replace Chamorro with native inhabitants of Guam
*  to avoid accusations of racial discrimination.
*  But in 2017, the Ninth District Court ruled that since the new law referred to
*  a statute that had previously stated Chamorro, it still violated the 15th
*  amendment and struck down the law.
*  The Supreme Court refused to hear the case.
*  The question of who would vote in the plebiscite was complicated, and
*  how it was phrased was contentious.
*  Over centuries of migration, the Chamorro have become a minority on the island.
*  In the 2020 census, 36% of the population identified as Asian alone,
*  with 29% of self-identifying as Filipino.
*  There were also debates as to whether any of the options on the ballot were truly
*  realistic.
*  Was Guam technically too small to be a state?
*  Too entwined with the United States to be freely associated, and
*  too reliant on American passports to be independent?
*  Would they lose their security or gain a say over it?
*  Still, the Circuit Court's rejection of Guam's appeal in 2019 inspired
*  the largest public protest on the island in recent memory.
*  It also left Guam's government nervous about trying again.
*  Democratic legislators want to ensure any new law is unassailable before
*  announcing it.
*  But no matter how and which way people believe the status discussion should be
*  decided, there is an overall acknowledgement that colonialism is an anachronism.
*  That territorial status should be modernized.
*  The absolute immense power that Congress has in the instance of the Insular Cases
*  is unfair, unconstitutional, and un-American.
*  But on the other hand, it gives them immense power to create a different
*  relationship with an entity like Guam.
*  Robert Underwood, Guam's representative in the House from 1993 to 2003, told me,
*  that could be independence, free association, or, if arranged in a certain way,
*  it could be unique legislation just for Guam.
*  This year is the 125th anniversary of the founding of the American Insular Empire,
*  including Guam and Puerto Rico.
*  When you think about other empires, the British, the French, the Spanish empires,
*  colonies are part of the national identity.
*  This acceptance that we have an empire, we have colonies.
*  Bavacqua, the museum curator and historian, said,
*  the United States, despite all that it's done,
*  lacks that basic ability on a national level to acknowledge the colony's problem.
*  Normally, it's just all these piecemeal attempts to deal with the colonies by
*  bringing them in closer to the United States, and that's part of the problem.
*  Colonizers that are so self-assured of their greatness only think of fixing
*  problems by giving more of themselves.
*  When I first started reading about Guam, I imagined the solution was enfranchisement,
*  voting rights, equal opportunity under the law, statehood,
*  more so-called American ideals.
*  The reality was significantly more complicated.
*  But more mortifying was that I simply hadn't known any of these debates were
*  happening in the first place.
*  I refer to Guam as America's best kept secret,
*  Natividad, the social work professor, told me.
*  We're just known as being the US military's outpost in the Pacific.
*  Even though there's been thousands of US military troops who have been stationed
*  here that have rotated for a century, you would think, how could they not know?
*  But the reality is we're just not a part of the gestalt of the American mind.
*  That goes deep.
*  When I talk about our colonized mind,
*  there's also something about being the colonizer.
*  The solution is not to give me the right to vote for president.
*  I don't want it.
*  I want us to exercise our right to decolonization, to self-determination
*  that is due to us and recognized in the international courts by the US,
*  signing on to the UN Charter.
*  That's what I want.
*  Don't give me any more bones if you're not going to give us freedom.
*  When we first met, Roy Gamboa invited me to see his family's land.
*  He was a veteran with base access, and I was a US citizen.
*  Given that he had brought visitors on before,
*  we both thought it would not be a problem.
*  But when he called the public affairs office of Naval Base Guam to try to bring
*  me in, no one returned his messages.
*  It took nearly two weeks to get us onto the base together, and
*  involved appeals that went all the way up to the public affairs office for
*  Joint Region Marianas Commander Nicholson.
*  When we did receive permission to visit the old cemetery in Sumai,
*  where he had come so freely as a child, a public affairs officer would have to
*  escort me in her vehicle during our entire trip.
*  The base visiting system on Guam is an impenetrable labyrinth.
*  Each base is under the control of a different commander,
*  who sets different regulations on who can come inside and how.
*  During my time on the island, I visited all of the large bases run by different
*  branches or subservices, Anderson Air Force Base,
*  Naval Base Guam, and Marine Corps Base Camp Laws.
*  I also saw the THAAD missile defense battery operated and controlled by the army.
*  But to make matters more confusing,
*  I was escorted there by a public affairs officer from the Air Force.
*  The THAAD also happens to be a place where the Guam National Armed Guard is on
*  active duty.
*  If you're confused about who is in charge of what, so are they.
*  Levin T. Kamacho, Guam's outgoing attorney general,
*  took me through Anderson Air Force Base to visit his family's land.
*  There are about a dozen family plots inside Anderson, so somewhat confusingly,
*  Chamorro families could still visit their tracts.
*  But because they were inside the base and therefore not connected to power or
*  sewage, they could not live on them.
*  As we stood in line in the equatorial sun to get into the small visitor building,
*  we chatted with an older veteran with a cane waiting with his wife.
*  They had to renew her visitor pass every three days, anytime they wanted to get
*  gas, go to the grocery store, or eat at the reduced price chains.
*  After an hour in the heat, we were the second to last visitors led into
*  the checkpoint before they closed for the day at 2 PM.
*  The 20 people who had been standing and
*  sweating behind us had to come back again tomorrow.
*  Inside, a harried young airman muttered frantically,
*  reminding herself of the steps she had to complete to process everyone in line.
*  I wrote my social security number on a plastic card for
*  a background check and left my fingerprint in some kind of electronic system.
*  After over an hour and a half of waiting,
*  we were allowed to get into Camacho's car and go to his family's land.
*  Naval Base Guam was significantly easier to get onto, paradoxically,
*  because unescorted visitors were not allowed at all.
*  The PAO drove me through the armed checkpoint without any problems.
*  We pulled up to a small, neat cemetery, all that remains of the largest historic
*  Chamorro village pre-contact, where we waited for Roy to arrive.
*  There was an eeriness to it, being on a large geopolitical target that
*  resembled a tropical paradise in the middle of the Pacific.
*  A sense of foreboding that was both ever present, and yet somehow totally absent.
*  Many people I spoke to, including Roy, had friends who relocated to
*  the continental United States just because of the danger of a North Korean or
*  Chinese nuclear missile strike.
*  I'm not ashamed to say I think of it once in a while.
*  Roy had told me, okay, if a nuke hit, there really is nothing anybody can do.
*  Guam is about 30 miles long.
*  If you don't get hit in the blast, there's the fallout.
*  When we were finally able to sit down together to talk about status,
*  Roy told me he had thought a lot about it and
*  elaborated that he believed the plebiscite should happen.
*  And as all the Chamorro I spoke to told me,
*  only those with Chamorro lineage should vote.
*  We have a huge target on our back, he told me.
*  And that's because of who we affiliate ourselves with, who's in charge of our land
*  and being the largest gas station, largest supply line in the Pacific.
*  I asked, do you know how you would vote?
*  Independence, he said.
*  I'm comfortable saying independence because at least we have a voice.
*  And we have the right to sit at the table to negotiate what our future as
*  a people will be, he explained.
*  Status quo can't be an option.
*  Leaving it as it is means we still leave the control in somebody else's hands.
*  He thought Guam had the resources and the intellect to decide its own future.
*  That the globalized world meant there could be more jobs and
*  remote work on the island.
*  They could sign a military basing agreement if they chose to.
*  Uncle Sam could stay, but on equal terms.
*  They would do better balancing their own needs and putting their own people first,
*  something they had not had a chance to do for 350 years.
*  When he first got out of the service, Roy wanted to buy a house in North Carolina.
*  He loved it out there, it was beautiful.
*  And by his calculations, the cost of living was half of what it was on Guam.
*  He could have lived there and not worried about so many things, but
*  his parents were on the island.
*  The one thing about Guam is family is everything, he told me.
*  So a lot of families are torn when they have to relocate for better opportunities.
*  I choose to stay here because this is where I want my kids to grow up,
*  in this culture.
*  I want them to know what it's like to be Chamoru.
*  As we talked it over, it seemed perhaps Roy had always felt some version of this,
*  but had never sat down to think that hard about it.
*  No one had ever asked him to.
*  Outsiders had always written Guam's history.
*  Roy and his children had been taught with textbooks from the continental United
*  States, from which their own culture, community, and status were absent.
*  The first textbooks to be written by Chamoru, centering their own people and
*  explaining Guam's history and colonization, would be published next year.
*  People in my generation have only known this way of life.
*  There's a continued lack of interest, he said.
*  But if it was a required course in high school,
*  maybe things might change over the next 15, 20 years.
*  Standing at the shores of the little bay, Roy pointed out the skipjacks,
*  still flipping.
*  His grandmother was born here, on this earth.
*  She was a year old when the Japanese invaded, and
*  lived with traces of what Roy identified as PTSD for the rest of her life.
*  His grandfather held on to their land for as long as he could.
*  But as they got older, the naval base simply became more established.
*  Contractors were hired to do sporadic landscaping.
*  The man and the boy still came every weekend to cut the grass.
*  And sometimes his grandfather would try to plant seedlings, but
*  eventually contractors would mow them down.
*  As time went on, the grass was cut so regularly,
*  there was nothing left for Roy and his grandfather to tend to.
*  So they would pick fruit.
*  Other times they would come just to visit with the land.
*  And then, over time, my grandfather just stopped coming on.
*  I guess as he got older, he started to figure,
*  we're probably never going to get the land back.
*  Roy hasn't told Roy Jr. about their land.
*  Something about having that conversation with his son was too hard.
*  It was disheartening for me to go through all of that stuff.
*  I didn't want to pass that down to him knowing that the situation that Guam is in,
*  Roy explained.
*  While my grandfather was hopeful, I've learned to deal with it.
*  I've taken him to different places on the base to go look at the monuments,
*  but never mentioned to him the land that we used to own.
*  It's giving him false hope.
