# The Sunday Read: ‘The Daring Ruse That Exposed China’s Campaign to Steal American Secrets’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epe5MlaCoo0)
*  Hi, my name is Yudhijit Padacharji and I'm a contributor to the New York Times Magazine
*  where I write about intelligence, national security, scams, and other topics.
*  This week's Sunday Read episode is from a recent story of mine for the magazine about
*  China's efforts to steal American technology and the human toll of that espionage.
*  So China's government has spent decades digging for intelligence so that it could hopefully
*  leapfrog other countries in terms of technological advancement.
*  50 years ago, that meant something relatively harmless, like collecting whatever information
*  was available from open sources like scientific journals and books and that sort of thing.
*  But there was a turning point in the 1980s.
*  China started hunting for secrets from the military and commercial sectors, which meant
*  looking for intellectual property for everything from say pesticides to wind turbines.
*  And this time, China also began using a new approach, tapping into Chinese descendants
*  all around the world.
*  The approach went something like this.
*  These agents and civilians would identify people with Chinese roots in other countries
*  who might work in a pivotal way for a company or a government lab or a university, someone
*  who might possess some bits of useful information.
*  They would court this person with free trips to China, invite them to give lectures, attend
*  conferences, and of course treat them lavishly with great food, luxury hotels, and maybe
*  a cash honorarium, all with the goal, experts told me, of building relationships that China
*  could take advantage of and eventually use to get a trade secret or two into its hands.
*  On the back end, Chinese intelligence officers would take in this trickle of information
*  and identify what they needed next in order to complete a larger picture.
*  It's an intelligence-gathering strategy known as 1,000 grains of sand.
*  So I've been reading a bunch of stories over the years about how China has been stealing
*  trade secrets and proprietary information from American companies and universities through
*  this 1,000 grains of sand approach.
*  And I came across a case involving two men, one I'll call Hua, who worked as an engineer
*  at GE Aviation in Ohio, and a Chinese intelligence officer named Xu Yanjun.
*  After a trip to China that he kept a secret from his employer, Hua ends up becoming an
*  asset for the FBI.
*  And his work with federal investigators reveals just how deep Chinese industrial espionage
*  goes.
*  The story starts with a linked-in request, but it ends in grave repercussions for both
*  parties, illustrating the downstream consequences of the geopolitical battle between China and
*  the United States.
*  So here's my article, The Daring Ruse That Exposed China's Campaign to Steal American
*  Secrets, read by Brian Nishi.
*  In March 2017, an engineer at GE Aviation in Cincinnati, whom I will refer to using
*  part of his Chinese given name, received a request on LinkedIn.
*  Hua is in his 40s, tall and athletic, with a boyish face that makes him look a decade
*  younger.
*  He moved to the United States from China in 2003 for graduate studies in structural
*  engineering.
*  After earning his PhD in 2007, he went to work for GE, first at the company's research
*  facility in Niskayuna, New York, for a few years, then at GE Aviation.
*  The linked-in request came from Chen Feng, a school official at the Nanjing University
*  and astronautics, NUAA, in eastern China.
*  Like most people who use LinkedIn, Hua was accustomed to connecting with professionals
*  on the site whom he didn't know personally, so the request did not strike him as unusual.
*  I didn't even think much about it before accepting, Hua told me.
*  Days later, Chen sent him an email inviting him to NUAA to give a research presentation.
*  Hua had always desired academic recognition.
*  When I did my PhD, I initially wanted to be a professor in China or in the United States,
*  he says.
*  But because his studies were focused more on practical applications than pure research,
*  a career in industry made more sense than one in academia.
*  At GE Aviation, he was part of a group that designed containment cases for the rotating
*  fan blades of jet engines.
*  The use of carbon-based composites in fan blades and their casings instead of metal
*  means lighter engines and a commercial advantage.
*  I felt honored to be invited to give a talk, Hua says.
*  Being recognized back home was especially fulfilling for Hua, who grew up poor in a
*  small village and was the only child there from his generation to go to college.
*  Beyond the prestige, the invitation also provided a free trip to China to see his friends and
*  family.
*  Hua arranged to arrive in May so he could attend a nephew's wedding and his college
*  reunion at Harbin Institute of Technology.
*  There was one problem, though.
*  Hua knew that GE would deny permission to give the talk if he asked, which he was supposed
*  to do.
*  Since GE is a high-tech company, it is difficult to get approval even to present at conferences
*  in the United States, he says.
*  The company was concerned about giving away proprietary information.
*  Hua made it clear to Chen that he would be able to discuss only research on composite
*  materials generally without going into the specifics of what he did at GE Aviation.
*  To prepare, Hua told me, he went back over the work he had done for his doctorate and
*  gathered additional information from scientific papers.
*  He also downloaded a few GE training files onto his laptop.
*  These contained instructions from GE experts on using composites.
*  Hua thought they would help him save time when putting together his presentation, which
*  he planned to do on his flight.
*  After he landed in China, Hua took a high-speed train from Beijing to Nanjing, where Chen drove
*  him to a hotel on the Nanjing University campus.
*  The next morning, Chen and Hua went to a meeting with a man who was introduced as Qu Hui, deputy
*  director of the Jiangsu Provincial Association for International Science and Technology Development.
*  Qu gave Hua a welcome gift, loose Chinese tea nicely packaged in a gift box.
*  I accepted it as an honor, Hua says.
*  I've liked drinking tea since I was a kid.
*  A few dozen students and faculty members attended Hua's talk.
*  They asked several questions that Hua was happy to answer.
*  I remember one student asked specifically about the architecture of the material I was
*  talking about in my presentation, he says.
*  I said, this is GE proprietary information.
*  I am just using this picture as an example, but I cannot share the details of what we
*  are designing or using.
*  After the presentation, Chen handed Hua an envelope filled with $3,500 in U.S. dollars,
*  reimbursement for his plane ticket and an honorarium for the talk.
*  Then they went to dinner with Qu and a couple of professors.
*  That night, Hua took a train back to Shanghai.
*  The next day, he flew back to the United States.
*  Once home, he realized he had forgotten to delete his presentation from the computer
*  at the University Auditorium in Nanjing.
*  He was concerned because the slides included some pictures with GE's logo.
*  So, Hua told me, I emailed one of the students and said, hey, can you delete the presentation?
*  He thought that would be the end of the matter.
*  The images of a Chinese spy balloon drifting through American airspace last month before
*  being shot down by a fighter jet off the coast of South Carolina were a conspicuous reminder
*  of the escalating geopolitical antagonisms between the United States and China.
*  Although world powers spying on each other is hardly unusual, the impunity with which
*  the Chinese were apparently conducting surveillance over U.S. military sites alarmed many.
*  The U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning China's brazen violation
*  of United States sovereignty in deploying the balloon, which was fitted with antennas
*  capable of collecting signals intelligence.
*  The Chinese government condemned its downing as an overreaction.
*  The incident, reminiscent of Cold War confrontations, inflamed tensions between two countries already
*  locked in a race for military, technological and economic supremacy.
*  The spy balloon's flight over U.S. territory was a very public display of China's intelligence
*  gathering, but the Chinese government has for decades been conducting a much less visible
*  and possibly more damaging campaign to steal American trade secrets and intellectual property.
*  While weapons and military equipment have always been a focus, Chinese agents and civilians
*  have been implicated in the theft or illicit transfer of various military technologies,
*  including those related to radar, fighter jets, submarines and weapons systems.
*  China's espionage expanded in the 1980s and beyond to also target commercial technologies
*  as diverse as pesticides, rice seeds, robotic cars and wind turbines.
*  Although China publicly denies engaging in economic espionage, Chinese officials will
*  indirectly acknowledge behind closed doors that the theft of intellectual property from
*  overseas is state policy.
*  James Lewis, a former diplomat now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies
*  in Washington, recalls participating in a meeting in 2014 or so at which Chinese and
*  American government representatives, including an officer from the People's Liberation Army,
*  discussed the subject.
*  An assistant secretary from the U.S. Department of Defense was explaining,
*  Look, spying is OK.
*  We spy, you spy, everybody spies.
*  But it's for political and military purposes, Lewis recounted for me.
*  It's for national security.
*  What we object to is your economic espionage.
*  And a senior PLA colonel said, Well, wait, we don't draw the line between national security
*  and economic espionage the way you do.
*  Anything that builds our economy is good for our national security.
*  The U.S. government's response increasingly appears to be a mirror image of the Chinese
*  perspective.
*  In the view of U.S. officials, the threat posed to America's economic interests by
*  Chinese espionage is a threat to American national security.
*  Like China's economy, the spying carried out on its behalf is directed by the Chinese
*  state.
*  The Ministry of State Security, or MSS, which is responsible for gathering foreign intelligence,
*  is tasked with collecting information and technologies that the Chinese government wants
*  to build up.
*  The current focus, according to U.S. counterintelligence experts, aligns with the Made in China 2025
*  initiative announced in 2015.
*  This industrial plan seeks to make China the world's top manufacturer in ten areas, including
*  robotics, artificial intelligence, new synthetic materials, and aerospace.
*  In the words of one former U.S. national security official, the plan is a roadmap for theft.
*  The Chinese government relies not only on its intelligence services, but also on businesses,
*  institutions and individuals to gather proprietary information.
*  A 2019 report from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a congressional
*  committee, lists the myriad ways in which Chinese companies, often backed by their government,
*  help transfer strategic know-how from the United States to China.
*  The maneuvers range from seemingly benign acquiring American firms with access to key
*  intellectual property, to notoriously coercive, compelling American companies to form joint
*  ventures with Chinese firms and share trade secrets with them in return for access to
*  the Chinese market, to outright theft.
*  Cyber attacks have become an increasingly common tactic because they can't always be
*  linked directly to the Chinese government.
*  Over the past few years, however, federal agents and cybersecurity experts in the U.S.
*  have identified the digital footprints left along the trails of these attacks, malware
*  and IP addresses among them, and traced this evidence back to specific groups of hackers
*  with proven ties to the Chinese government.
*  Perhaps most unsettling is the way China has sought to exploit the huge numbers of people
*  of Chinese origin who have settled in the West.
*  The Ministry of State Security, along with other Chinese government-backed organizations,
*  spends considerable effort recruiting spies from this diaspora.
*  Chinese students and faculty members at American universities are a major target, as are employees
*  at American corporations.
*  The Chinese leadership made the declaration early on that all Chinese belong to China
*  no matter what country they were born or living in.
*  James Gaylord, a retired counterintelligence agent with the FBI, told me.
*  They started making appeals to Chinese Americans, saying,
*  There's no conflict between you being American and sharing information with us.
*  We're not a threat.
*  We just want to be able to compete and make the Chinese people proud.
*  You're Chinese, and therefore you must want to see the Chinese nation prosper.
*  Stripped of its context and underlying intent, that message can carry a powerful resonance
*  for Chinese Americans and expatriates keen to contribute to nation-building back home.
*  Not all can foresee that their willingness to help China could lead them to break American
*  laws.
*  An even more troubling consequence of China's exploitation of people it regards as Chinese
*  is that it can lead to the undue scrutiny of employees in American industry and academia,
*  subjecting them to unfair suspicions of disloyalty toward the United States.
*  Kua didn't regard his visit to China to share his technical expertise as extraordinary
*  in any way.
*  Many scientists and engineers of Chinese origin in the United States are invited to China
*  to give presentations about their fields.
*  Kua couldn't have known that his trip to Nanjing would prove to be the start of a series
*  of events that would end up giving the U.S. government an unprecedented look inside China's
*  widespread and tireless campaign of economic espionage targeting the United States, culminating
*  in the first ever conviction of a Chinese intelligence official on American soil.
*  Around noon on November 1, 2017, a few hours after he scanned his security badge and entered
*  his office at GE Aviation, Kua received a call from the company's IT desk asking him
*  to come meet with GE's security officers.
*  The call heightened a sense of anxiety he had felt since that morning when he and others
*  in his group were asked to hand over their removable hard disks for what IT described
*  as a computer security review.
*  A while later, they were asked to turn in their work laptops.
*  Kua couldn't help wondering if this had anything to do with the secret of his Nanjing trip
*  that he had been keeping from his employer.
*  Soon enough, his fears were confirmed.
*  The GE security officers waiting to interview him in an auditorium wanted to know about
*  his trip to China six months earlier.
*  Where had he visited and why?
*  Kua told them he had gone back home for a college reunion and spent all his time reconnecting
*  with friends and family.
*  Then the security officers told Kua that the FBI wanted to talk to him.
*  Two FBI agents who were already in the building entered the room.
*  One of them was Bradley Hull, a bright-eyed man with a shaved head and a goatee.
*  He started with the same questions that GE security had asked about Kua's China trip.
*  Kua was shaking with nervousness, one of the agents told me in an interview.
*  He repeated the answers he had given to his employer's security officers.
*  Hull proceeded to ask more questions about the trip, giving Kua several chances to amend
*  his story and signaling that he didn't think Kua was being truthful.
*  Finally, he confronted Kua with evidence showing that Kua had met with people other than just
*  friends and family.
*  He had also paid a visit to the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
*  Kua sank into his chair as if knocked back.
*  It was a crime to lie to a federal agent, Hull told him.
*  He advised Kua to relate everything he could remember about the visit to NUAA.
*  Kua, in shock, wasn't immediately forthcoming, but over the course of the interview, as Hull
*  pressed him with follow-up questions, Kua ended up providing an account of why he visited
*  Nanjing and what he did there.
*  The agent who spoke to me described the interview as incremental truth-telling.
*  Kua finally disclosed that he had given a presentation at NUAA about designing airplane
*  parts out of composite materials.
*  He said he had been careful to not divulge any information that was proprietary to GE,
*  even though he had downloaded certain files that belonged to his employer to help prepare
*  his slides.
*  As Kua provided more details about his visit, Hull became convinced that he had been hosted
*  at Nanjing by Chinese intelligence officials looking to cultivate the engineer as an asset,
*  someone who could steal trade secrets for them.
*  Around 4.30 p.m., at which point the interview had been going for a few hours, Hull suggested
*  taking a break to eat some pizza that he had ordered for everyone.
*  He also made Kua an offer.
*  The FBI wouldn't recommend that charges be brought against him if he agreed to cooperate
*  and take part in a counterintelligence operation against the Chinese.
*  Kua had already been informed that the FBI had been carrying out a search at his home
*  that afternoon while he was being interviewed.
*  His car had also been towed away to be searched.
*  And here at work, the agents had already caught him lying, which he realized was enough to
*  land him in trouble.
*  Even though he hadn't shared any trade secrets at his Nanjing presentation, some of the documents
*  downloaded to his laptop before he went to China were marked export controlled, a government-mandated
*  designation for which he could face criminal charges.
*  He knew what he had to do to save himself and his family.
*  No one begrudges a nation that generates the most innovative ideas and from them develops
*  the best technology, John Demers, former Assistant Attorney General for National Security said
*  in a 2018 hearing before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee.
*  But we cannot tolerate a nation that steals our firepower and the fruits of our brainpower.
*  The accusation that China has been relentlessly stealing intellectual property from American
*  companies and institutions, although China is now a manufacturing giant, for technology
*  it still relies heavily on the United States and Europe, is neither new nor unfounded.
*  In 2008, a Chinese-born engineer named Jermai, who worked for a defense contractor in California,
*  was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison for having stolen and passed on to China information
*  about several sensitive technologies, including systems for the U.S. Navy.
*  The Jermai investigation led to the uncovering of another Chinese spy, Dong Fangzhong, an
*  engineer at Boeing who gave his handlers in China thousands of documents containing designs
*  and other technical specifications relating to American fighter jets, the U.S. space shuttle
*  and the Delta IV rocket.
*  In the past decade, individuals working for Chinese entities have been caught taking or
*  trying to take trade secrets across many industries.
*  One notable case involved six Chinese nationals in the United States attempting to steal proprietary
*  corn seeds from fields in Iowa and Illinois.
*  A California engineer named Walter Liu was caught stealing secrets relevant to the production
*  of titanium dioxide, which is used as a whitener in paint and toothpaste.
*  Individuals of Chinese origin have been indicted in recent years for the theft of proprietary
*  information relating to locomotives, semiconductors, solar panels and other high-tech products.
*  In recent years, China has been recruiting those it considers expat nationals through
*  hundreds of formal talent programs, which identify experts in American schools and industries
*  to help fill specific gaps in knowledge back home.
*  It's a vehicle to get them to travel back to China to attend conferences, to provide
*  lectures which allows the opportunity to develop a relationship with them and later take advantage
*  of that relationship to get intellectual property.
*  Gunnar Neuquist, a former counterintelligence agent for the Naval Criminal Investigative
*  Service told me,
*  The guests are often hosted in luxury hotels, driven around in limousines, taken on sightseeing
*  tours.
*  After receiving this lavish treatment, Gaylord says, some feel obligated to provide information
*  that they might not have initially planned to share.
*  While at the FBI, Gaylord interviewed many scientists and engineers of Chinese origin
*  who had been courted in this fashion.
*  Some of them described how they had been pressured.
*  They would say,
*  Everything in my presentation was approved by my company.
*  After I finished it and stepped down, a gaggle of students surrounded me to ask more questions.
*  And they kept pushing me for more and more sensitive information, Gaylord says.
*  And a lot of them say,
*  You know, after a while, you start to break down.
*  You can't keep saying, I can't talk about this.
*  You then start answering around the edges, giving away more and more.
*  The Chinese government also offers financial incentives to help Chinese expats start their
*  own businesses in China, using trade secrets stolen from their American employers.
*  Gaylord told me about Wenfeng Lu, an engineer who worked at Edwards Life Sciences in Irvine,
*  California.
*  Lu's employer reported him to the FBI after discovering that he had been downloading proprietary
*  information about the company's heart catheters.
*  Gaylord and his colleagues opened an investigation and discovered, among other red flags, that
*  Lu was often collecting this material right before trips to China.
*  Agents arrested him as he was preparing to leave the country for another visit.
*  On the laptop and thumb drives that he was carrying, investigators found information
*  he had taken from his employer.
*  Searching his house, agents found more documents he had collected from two other US medical
*  device companies where he had worked.
*  Then, in his laptop, we found agreements between him and municipal government officials in
*  China offering him research offices in an industrial park in Nanjing that would be rent-free
*  for the first three years, Gaylord says.
*  In other words, he steals the R&D, cost our companies incur, and he goes there and develops
*  it for a lot cheaper, and has the whole China market without any revenues going to the American
*  companies.
*  Lu pleaded guilty to charges of unauthorized possession of trade secrets and in 2019 was
*  sentenced to 27 months in prison.
*  The FBI is loath to give away sources and methods, so the agency would not disclose
*  to me how agents learned of Hua's visit to Nanjing.
*  But from the start, it's suspected that Hua's hosts wanted more than an innocent academic
*  exchange.
*  As the investigators learned more about the trip, they could see that it had all the hallmarks
*  of an intelligence operation.
*  The initial contact through LinkedIn.
*  The introduction to people who had weaker ties to NUAA.
*  The FBI suspected that the Jiangsu Science and Technology Association was a front for
*  the Chinese government and that Qu Hui, the man who gave Hua the tea, was an intelligence
*  officer.
*  The agents wanted to learn more about Qu, who seemed to be the key figure behind the
*  Chinese attempt to recruit Hua, and they saw an opportunity to go further than just an
*  investigation into Hua.
*  The agent who spoke to me likened their counterintelligence operation to swimming upstream.
*  And so, in exchange for an assurance that he wouldn't face charges, Hua became an asset
*  for the FBI, willing to communicate with his Chinese contacts at the FBI's behest.
*  Deception often lies at the heart of espionage and counterespionage.
*  Success for both spies and spy hunters can hinge on finding a foolproof way to deceive
*  their targets.
*  In describing Hua's communications with his hosts in China, the agent emphasized that
*  the investigators didn't type anything themselves.
*  Hua wrote the messages himself to give them the veneer of authenticity that the FBI wanted.
*  A team of agency linguists assisted Hull, who doesn't know Mandarin, with figuring out
*  what Hua might say and how to say it.
*  Ultimately, though, they needed to rely on Hua's own judgment about exactly how to phrase
*  things.
*  After his return from China, Hua stayed in touch with his hosts in Nanjing.
*  I will definitely contact you again if I have a chance to visit China in the future, he
*  wrote to Qu, keeping the door open for another academic exchange at the university.
*  Now, at Hull's direction, he sent Qu a message over WeChat on December 20, a month and a
*  half after the FBI first interviewed him.
*  He told Qu he would be willing to return for another visit in February, a week before the
*  Chinese New Year.
*  In earlier conversations with Qu, he talked about his responsibilities as the oldest son
*  in the family, and so it made sense for him to want to visit home during the Chinese New
*  Year.
*  Qu consented to the offer.
*  I will touch base with the scientific research department here to see what technology is
*  desired and I will let you know what to prepare, he texted Hua on January 9, 2018.
*  By now, federal agents had obtained search warrants for two email addresses that Qu
*  had used for his correspondence with Hua, JASTXYJ at Gmail.com and JASTQUHUI at Gmail.com.
*  In what would prove to be a lucky break, the investigators found that each email address
*  was the Apple ID used for an iPhone linked to an iCloud account where data from the phones
*  was periodically backed up.
*  The agents were later able to obtain search warrants for the two iCloud accounts.
*  The one linked to JASTQUHUI at Gmail.com opened a treasure trove.
*  This included confirmation of what they had suspected all along, that Qu worked for Chinese
*  intelligence.
*  His real name was Xu Yanzhun.
*  He had worked at the Ministry of State Security since 2003, earning six promotions to become
*  a deputy division director of the 6th Bureau in the Jiangsu Province MSS.
*  Like so many of us, he had taken pictures of important documents using his iPhone, his
*  national ID card, pay stubs, his health insurance card, and application for vacation, which
*  is how they ended up in his iCloud account.
*  There investigators also found an audio recording of a 2016 conversation with a professor at
*  NUAA, in which Xu had talked about his job in intelligence and the risks associated with
*  traveling.
*  The leadership asks you to get the materials of the US F-22 fighter aircraft, he told the
*  professor.
*  You can't get it by sitting at home.
*  The discovery of evidence of Xu's identity in an iCloud account makes for a kind of delicious
*  reversal.
*  The ubiquitous use of iPhones around the world, a result of America's technological prowess,
*  was helping to fight back against a rival nation's efforts to steal technology.
*  The revelation that the target of their investigation was a senior level MSS officer raised the
*  stakes for the FBI.
*  The agent characterizes the unmasking of Xu as a significant milestone in the effort to
*  combat economic espionage by the Chinese, for reasons that go beyond this one case.
*  When FBI agents go out to talk to companies and universities about the threat, he says,
*  skeptical listeners ask for the evidence that proves the theft of trade secrets is part
*  of a campaign directed by China's government.
*  In Xu Yanzhun, the FBI now had the example it needed.
*  Here was an intelligence officer working as a puppet master, in one agent's characterization
*  of the events, cultivating people at American companies in order to steal trade secrets.
*  The FBI was determined to build a case against him and even arrest him if it could.
*  Hua was put on leave without pay by GE Aviation right after the FBI interviewed him in November
*  2017.
*  As he struggled to find paid work in the weeks that followed, his efforts on behalf of the
*  FBI kept him engaged.
*  Under the agency's direction, he kept up his exchanges with Xu over WeChat and email,
*  expressing eagerness to share information from GE.
*  Just recently, I've heard the speculation about laying off in my department.
*  I, of course, don't want to be affected, but the possibility is there, he wrote in a message
*  on January 23.
*  That's why I'm trying my best to collect as much information as possible.
*  Xu asked if Hua could send material relating to the specifications and design process for
*  building an encasement for fan blades.
*  Hua obliged with a document titled GE9X Fan Containment Case Design Consensus Review.
*  It had the appearance of being useful, but didn't contain anything of real value.
*  GE Aviation, which was cooperating with the FBI, had altered the document.
*  This bait worked.
*  Xu, emboldened, sent a list of domestic requirements that he wanted Hua to collect information
*  for, such as the type of software used in designing composite structures.
*  On February 5, about a week before Hua arranged with Xu to visit Nanjing again, Xu asked
*  him to copy the table of contents of his GE Laptops directory into a file that he could
*  bring with him.
*  He provided instructions on how to create the file in Notepad.
*  The document would give a high-level picture of the work Hua's group at GE was doing, and
*  more important, it would indicate what information Hua had access to.
*  The FBI never intended for Hua to travel to China.
*  On February 7, he sent Xu a message saying he couldn't make the trip because his boss
*  had asked him to go to France and march for work.
*  There was a lot to do in preparation for that trip, he explained, so he wasn't being allowed
*  to take any time off.
*  Because the ticket already booked is not refundable, he wrote, even my parents are very disappointed.
*  He asked if he could still be reimbursed for the airfare.
*  Xu, presumably disappointed that the meeting wasn't going to happen, was noncommittal.
*  He messaged in response, can we resolve all these issues the next time you come back?
*  Xu's interest was rekindled a week later, however, when Hua emailed him a copy of his
*  laptop directory, stripped of any information that GE regarded as sensitive.
*  Xu proposed that they get together somewhere in Europe after Hua traveled to France in
*  March.
*  Until this point, they had been communicating by email and WeChat, but on February 27,
*  apparently eager to finalize his suggested meeting, Xu attempted to make a video call
*  to Hua when it was nearly 10 p.m. in Cincinnati.
*  Hua was at home, but with no FBI agents by his side to instruct him on what to do, he
*  couldn't risk answering.
*  About an hour later, at Hull's direction, he messaged Xu, sorry, missed your call,
*  I was trying to put the child to sleep.
*  He added that he would be visiting France from March 25 to April 6.
*  When Xu and Hua spoke the next day to arrange a meeting place, Hua suggested Belgium or
*  Germany or the Netherlands.
*  That way, he said, he could get away from his GE colleagues.
*  The real reason was different.
*  The FBI wanted the meeting to happen in a country that would be amenable to arresting
*  Xu.
*  The French government was unlikely to agree.
*  Xu asked if Hua could bring along the contents of the directory he had sent.
*  I think that is pretty good stuff, Xu said.
*  Hua said he planned to bring his laptop to their meeting.
*  The thing is, can you export the stuff out?
*  Xu asked.
*  Hua confirmed that he could and assured him again that he would have the files with him.
*  All right, Xu said, let's try our best to meet in Europe.
*  In the last week of March 2018, Hua flew to Brussels accompanied by Hull and other
*  agents.
*  For months he had been playing an active role in their investigation.
*  Now he was about to participate in a field operation.
*  His wife was worried.
*  I tried to explain to her that everything would be fine, he told me.
*  Xu had flown to Amsterdam.
*  He wanted Hua to meet him there, but the FBI wanted Xu to go to Belgium.
*  Behind the scenes, US authorities had been working to secure cooperation from a European
*  country which they ultimately got from the Belgian government.
*  Hull had Hua explain to Xu that he couldn't come to Amsterdam on March 31st as planned
*  because his boss had asked him to visit a plant in Belgium.
*  He could meet on April 1st instead, and it would have to be in Brussels.
*  The change of plans flustered Xu.
*  It would be difficult for him to change his itinerary, he messaged back.
*  He suggested they stick to meeting in Amsterdam.
*  In a voice call to Hua over WeChat, he explained that traveling to a new country for the meeting
*  without prior approval from his superiors in China would be considered serious misconduct.
*  He then proposed they meet in Rotterdam.
*  Hua could make it to the Dutch city and return to Brussels the same day.
*  The FBI had to come up with a reason for Hua to reject Xu's proposal.
*  Sunday is Easter, which my boss takes seriously, Hua messaged Xu over WeChat.
*  He has reserved an Easter lunch for the traveling team and asked us better to attend.
*  There was no way he could leave Brussels.
*  Xu finally gave in, and Hua sent him a photo of a coffee shop in the galleries of Saint-Hubert,
*  a historic landmark in central Brussels whose grand, high-pillared architecture and arched
*  glass-paned roof are a draw for tourists.
*  The meeting was set for three in the afternoon, but Xu went to check out the coffee shop
*  a few hours earlier, accompanied by a colleague from the MSS.
*  The two men walked through the galleries.
*  As they approached the coffee shop, Belgian federal police officers placed them under arrest.
*  In addition to two smartphones and about 7,000 euros, Xu and his colleague had $7,000 in
*  hundred-dollar bills, cash that they presumably planned to give to Hua that afternoon.
*  Six months later, Xu was extradited to the United States to face charges of economic espionage.
*  I saw Xu at a pre-sentencing hearing on August 23rd last year in federal court in Cincinnati,
*  dressed in an orange and white prison jumpsuit.
*  Despite being somewhat tall, Xu looks compact, with a squarish face that didn't betray much
*  emotion as the day's proceedings got underway, except for one moment early on when he was
*  struggling with shackled hands to review some papers his lawyers were showing him.
*  At the judge's direction, a federal marshal unshackled him.
*  Freed, even if only in a limited sense, Xu gave a nod of gratitude.
*  It was striking, based on a court filing submitted by Xu's lawyers, to note the parallels in the
*  early lives of Xu and Hua in China. Like Hua, Xu was born into a family of modest means.
*  Like Hua, he devoted himself to the pursuit of good grades, studying late into the night and on
*  weekends. Excelling in academics was one way to build a better life. Like Hua, Xu became the first
*  person in his family to go to college, where he earned undergraduate and graduate engineering
*  degrees. That's where the similarities between the paths of their two lives end.
*  In 2003, the year Hua left for the United States, Xu started working for the Ministry of State
*  Security. During a two-week trial in Cincinnati that began in October 2021, more than three years
*  after Xu's extradition to the United States, federal prosecutors laid out their case.
*  Xu was represented by a team that included five attorneys from Taft, Statenius and Hollister,
*  a leading Midwest law firm which suggests that the hundreds of thousands of dollars required
*  in legal fees was paid by the Chinese government. The firm declined to comment for this article.
*  The defense argued that Xu had been tricked. The intent behind his correspondence with Hua
*  was not to steal trade secrets, but simply to facilitate an academic exchange between Hua
*  and Chinese scientists. Ralph Conan, one of the defense attorneys, said in his closing argument,
*  What's happened here is Mr. Xu, my client, has become a pawn, a pawn in the tense place
*  between U.S. industries trying to exploit China and trying to get along with China.
*  The prosecution contended that Xu had been systematically going after intellectual property
*  at aerospace companies in the United States and Europe through cyber espionage and the use of
*  human sources. It's not often that prosecutors find a one-stop shop for much of their evidence,
*  but that's what Xu's iCloud account was, a repository of the spy's personal and professional
*  life. That's because often Xu used his iPhone calendar as a diary documenting not just the
*  day's events but also his thoughts and feelings. Several entries from 2017, for instance,
*  indicate rising tensions with his boss, a man named Jia Rong. Jia rejected a meal receipt today,
*  he wrote, on March 27. Then, on April 28, relationship with Jia has dropped to freezing
*  point. Other entries from that period, when he started corresponding with Hua, reflect an
*  unhappiness in Xu's personal life, such as one from August 17, in which he lamented the breakup
*  of what appears to have been an extramarital romance. She saw me in the rain yesterday morning,
*  didn't stop, and she walked away with her umbrella. Things weren't going well financially either,
*  as evidenced by a snippet from an entry on May 19. I lost so much in the stock market,
*  I got myself into this financial hole. Also backed up to the cloud were messages that Xu
*  had exchanged with several other U.S. aerospace industry employees, which prosecutors laid out
*  at trial. One of them was Arthur Gao from a Honeywell division in Phoenix who testified
*  at trial that Rong and Xu paid him $5,000 and covered his airfare to China for a 2017
*  visit to Nanjing to make a technical presentation. In May 2021, Gao pleaded guilty in Arizona to a
*  charge of exporting controlled information without a license. Bloomberg Businessweek
*  covered Xu's case extensively in an article published last September.
*  Another was an engineer at the aviation company Fokker who accepted Xu's invitation to visit
*  China to share information with a Chinese research institute after Xu arranged to help
*  the engineer's parents, who had lost their home in China when their building was set to be
*  demolished as part of a development project. An IT specialist from Boeing who testified at the
*  trial under the alias Sun Li described how Xu attempted to cultivate a relationship with him,
*  first reaching out through an email in which he mentioned having contacted the witness's dad,
*  an academic in China. The witness subsequently met with Xu, who repeatedly offered to reimburse
*  his round-trip tickets to China in exchange for sharing his knowledge of and experience in IT.
*  The witness finally stopped communicating with Xu after realizing that Xu was not actually
*  interested in his expertise, which was project management, but in something else that I could
*  not provide. What they call exchanges are not just a nice invitation. Timothy Mangan, who led
*  the prosecution, told me, encapsulating a point he made to the jury. It's part of a recruiting cycle.
*  Some pan out, some don't, but this is them throwing the fishing lines out, trying to vet people.
*  At Xu's trial, Mangan buttressed the argument about the so-called exchanges being anything
*  but benign by citing an audio recording of a four-hour meeting between Xu and several Chinese
*  engineers. Why Xu should have recorded this conversation is inexplicable, and surprisingly
*  imprudent in hindsight given that it ended up in an iCloud account. But in it, he explains the
*  approach to soliciting information from Chinese expatriates. As experts abroad, it would be very
*  difficult for them to directly take large batches of materials due to the fact that their company's
*  security is very tight, Xu tells the engineers, emphasizing the need to consider the risks
*  involved for sources being targeted. At another point in the conversation, he talks about how to
*  spot potential recruits while targeting specific technologies. For example, if I am an aircraft
*  person, then I would search into Boeing or Lockheed, right? Find it at Lockheed Martin, Xu said.
*  After I found the person, I would find out if this person is doing something,
*  like in charge of overall design or avionics. The messages in Xu's iCloud account enabled
*  investigators to make another damning discovery. Xu had helped coordinate a cyber espionage
*  campaign that targeted several aviation technology companies. Those attacks, described in a report
*  by CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, started in 2010, shortly after the state-owned Commercial
*  Aircraft Corporation of China, Comac, announced that it had chosen a joint venture between GE
*  Aviation and Safran to supply a custom-made engine for China's first domestically manufactured
*  commercial airliner, the C-919. The plan behind the campaign, which was directed against Honeywell,
*  Capstone Turbine and Safran, among others, became clear only later when security researchers connected
*  the dots. When I started putting all these victims together, I was like, okay, these are all component
*  manufacturers for different pieces of the C-919. Adam Kozey, a cybersecurity expert who runs the
*  security firm SinaCyber and was the lead author of the CrowdStrike report, told me,
*  Although Comac was prepared to procure components needed to build the aircraft from these companies,
*  the Chinese government was evidently also working to steal intellectual property from those suppliers
*  in order to make domestic manufacturing possible in China, according to the report.
*  Xu played a role in these efforts, the prosecution argued at trial.
*  In his iCloud account were several messages that Xu had exchanged with a manufacturing engineer
*  employed with Safran named Tian Xi, indicating that they had been plotting to hack into the
*  company's computer network. The plan was to have Tian, who was working at a Safran plant in Jiangsu,
*  install malware provided by Xu onto the laptop of a Safran employee visiting from France.
*  It took many weeks for the plan to succeed. Tian sent Xu a triumphant text on January 25,
*  2014, saying, the horse is planted, a reference to a Trojan horse, a type of malware.
*  Tian was indicted on related charges. The case is pending.
*  At the end of the trial, Xu was convicted of conspiring and attempting to commit economic
*  espionage and theft of trade secrets. In a sentencing memorandum filed last November,
*  Xu's lawyers painted a sympathetic portrait of the spy, describing him as a kind man who
*  loved playing soccer with his son and routinely carried groceries up several flights of stairs
*  for elderly neighbors. Xu was simply doing his job, they pointed out, adding that he was not a rogue
*  operator or criminal mastermind. A lenient sentence would be appropriate, the memo argued,
*  because the U.S. government couldn't hope to deter China's theft of intellectual property
*  by harshly punishing a single intelligence officer. The judge wasn't swayed. On November
*  16, last year, Xu was sentenced to 20 years in prison. His conviction is now being appealed.
*  Xu's arrest and prosecution could be likened to the capture of an enemy combatant who is then made
*  a prisoner of war, but for an important distinction that U.S. officials make, that this war, or economic
*  espionage offensive, is being waged unilaterally by China. The Chinese government, which maintains
*  that America's accusations of economic espionage are slanderous, has described the charges against
*  Xu as made out of thin air. According to Mangan, the evidence laid out during Xu's trial goes far
*  beyond merely proving his guilt. It uncovers the systematic nature of China's vast economic espionage.
*  The revelation of Xu's activities lifts the veil on how pervasive China's economic espionage is,
*  according to the FBI agent. If just one provincial officer can do what he did,
*  the agent suggests, you can imagine how big the country's overall operations must be.
*  A sense of that scale comes from a pair of indictments unveiled in federal court in the
*  District of Columbia in 2019 and 2020, naming five computer hackers in China responsible for
*  intrusions into more than 100 businesses, non-profits, and government agencies in the
*  United States and other countries. The hackers belong to the group APT41, which the Department
*  of Justice says is backed by the Chinese government, and it didn't restrict itself
*  to the theft of intellectual property and business information. Investigators say the hackers also
*  purloined more than a million detailed call records from telecom companies. APT41 appears
*  to have developed a data modeling way to mine this type of information and map the social networks
*  of specific targets, including a Tibetan monk living in India and pro-democracy activists in Hong
*  Kong. The cases are pending. One day last September, I traveled to Cincinnati to ask Hua
*  about what he had gone through. He agreed to meet on the condition that I protect his identity.
*  Even though he testified in court under his real name, he wanted to draw as little attention to
*  himself as possible, especially out of a concern for his family. We met at a Chinese restaurant
*  for lunch. Walking over to the table where I was sitting with his attorney, he greeted me with a
*  gentle handshake and asked me to excuse him for speaking softly because of a rib injury he'd
*  suffered while jogging. Hua told me he had spent the past few years rebuilding his life. During
*  the time he was helping the FBI with its investigation, he was effectively unemployed.
*  GE fired Hua after he was on leave for several months, except for a couple of weeks when he
*  worked as a driver for Uber Eats. He finally found a job with an engineering company unrelated to
*  his expertise. Still, he didn't see himself as a victim. Why did I have to accept the invitation
*  without consulting my employer, my family, he said. I bear the consequences of what I did.
*  He brightened when I asked him about his interest in composites. It's a fascinating field, he said.
*  You can design a composite in many ways. You can think out of the box. You have a lot of flexibility
*  in engineering it. When I asked if he'd thought about returning to the field, however,
*  he shook his head. I don't want to, he said. He seemed worried that going back to designing
*  composite structures would somehow open a fresh portal to the trauma he was trying to leave behind.
*  A few times during our conversation, I saw his eyes glisten and his lips quiver.
*  But whenever I pressed him to describe how he felt about what he had been through,
*  his face would take on a stoic expression as if he was trying to keep his emotions in check.
*  If you ask me, are there days when I have trouble falling asleep? Yes, there are. I regret what I did.
*  But I always tell myself, that's the past. What can I do? I can only look forward to see what I
*  can do tomorrow. When Hua told me how he agreed to assist the FBI to save himself and his family,
*  I couldn't help thinking of him and Xu as chess pieces in a geopolitical game that they had little
*  control over. Two men of similar background whose lives had collided, with unfortunate
*  results for both. I asked Hua if he felt any anger toward Xu for arranging his visit to Nanjing.
*  No, Hua replied. He was just doing what he was asked to do.
*  Weeks later, after Xu's sentencing on November 16th, Hua relayed a message to me through his
*  attorney to say that he was saddened to hear that Xu would be spending such a long time in prison.
*  He is not my enemy, Hua said. We are all just normal people.
