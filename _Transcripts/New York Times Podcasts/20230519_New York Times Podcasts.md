# When the Culture Wars Came for NASA
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LTUy6h_wB0)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is a daily.
*  The James Webb Space Telescope has revolutionized the way that we see the universe.
*  But naming that telescope sparked an unexpected firestorm within NASA and the wider scientific
*  community.
*  Today, my colleague Michael Powell tells the story of the astrophysicist whose quest to
*  end the controversy only made it worse.
*  It's Friday, May 19th.
*  Michael, welcome to the studio.
*  Thank you.
*  My pleasure.
*  I want to start by talking about your beat, because your beat did not exist even five
*  years ago, right?
*  Right.
*  It's a new beat, and I think it's worth explaining what exactly it is.
*  It's not easy to describe.
*  I colloquially think of it as the third rail beat.
*  Do not touch this rail beat.
*  Yes, but essentially looking at free expression, free speech, and intellectual debates very
*  often around ethnicity, race, gender.
*  So yeah, all of the hot buttons in our current cultural climate.
*  Right.
*  It's already thorny beat.
*  And just so listeners understand, what actual kinds of stories are we talking about here?
*  The broader landscape is, look, we are in the middle of ferocious battles over book
*  banning, over transgender identity, whether transgender athletes can compete.
*  So these are the sort of stories that I'm looking at on a regular basis.
*  Some of those are these kind of broader questions, and then some are because these are the ones
*  that galvanize our attention.
*  What happens to an individual who finds him or herself caught up in these battles?
*  And you're here, Michael, to talk about how this kind of a battle came to, of all places,
*  NASA, the nation's premier space agency.
*  Recording going.
*  So where does that story start?
*  Okay.
*  Can you tell me your name and who you are?
*  Yes, I'm Dr. Hakim Oluseyi.
*  It starts with this, frankly, very impressive man.
*  Dr. Hakim Oluseyi.
*  I am an astrophysicist, and I'm newly a research faculty fellow at Princeton's Plasma Physics
*  Laboratory.
*  So he's a member of the small elite club of black physicists.
*  In fact, he's the president of the National Society of Black Physicists.
*  And he himself comes out of a background that really kind of made it unlikely that you'd
*  ever see him as a scientist.
*  Hmm.
*  Explain that.
*  He had this kind of itinerant childhood.
*  His father was a drug dealer.
*  His mother had a very tough time of it.
*  His parents divorced when he was only four years old, and he was never in the same place
*  for more than a few years at a time.
*  New Orleans, Los Angeles, Houston.
*  Eventually, his family settles in rural Mississippi.
*  When did you first realize you were going to be interested in science?
*  You know, as far as back as I can remember.
*  I was interested in the natural world, and I was also interested in everything that's
*  weird.
*  And I was...
*  And his interest in science came very young.
*  When I was 10 years old, I decided that I was going to read our family set of world
*  book encyclopedias from A to Z. I get to E, and I encounter Albert Einstein and relativity.
*  All right.
*  So this brings together everything that interested me.
*  So I vowed to teach myself relativity, never thinking that one day I'd be a scientist.
*  I didn't see...
*  And his mom sees this burning desire to learn in her son.
*  She does the best she can to encourage it.
*  So my mother did factory work.
*  So there were times, you know, she'd work 3D 11, 11 to 7.
*  And there were, you know, sometimes on certain weeks based on her shift, I wouldn't see her
*  at all.
*  But I'd come home, and on the dining room table, she had gone to either the Laurel Library
*  or our little library in Heidelberg, Mississippi, and brought two or three books on either Albert
*  Einstein or relativity for me to consume.
*  And you know, I'd get so excited.
*  It was like Christmas for me.
*  And he just had this preternatural ability with mathematics and physics.
*  He graduates from high school, then he gets his PhD at Stanford University.
*  And eventually he gets a job as a professor at the Florida Institute of Technology.
*  And one day in 2015, he's reading this online article.
*  You know, I'm doing my normal, you know, take a break between work and just go get lost
*  on the internet, right?
*  Go down some rabbit hole.
*  And he comes across this rather stunning story involving NASA's Deep Space Telescope, most
*  powerful such telescope ever made.
*  And it's named after James Webb, former administrator of NASA during the whole moon launch effort.
*  And the article argues that he is absolutely not deserving of that honor.
*  In fact, the title of the article is the problem with naming observatories for bigots.
*  Would you mind kind of in a sense, walk through the accusations like one by one?
*  What's the bill of indictment against James Webb?
*  They were pretty explicit.
*  They said James Webb was a homophobe who ruined the lives and careers of gay federal employees
*  in the 1940s and 50s.
*  That article argued that before coming to NASA, James Webb had led purges of gay employees
*  while at the State Department.
*  And it quotes him saying really inflammatory things about getting rid of gay employees.
*  And the writer, who's a journalist and a physicist, says that this is a sort of moral
*  reckoning that we cannot in the 21st century honor a man such as this by putting his name
*  on a space telescope that is going to be used the world round.
*  So for instance, this journalist writes, it's easy for white male physicists like me to
*  ignore the less savory aspects of our scientific heroes.
*  But it's long past time we stopped.
*  So James Webb is facing pretty serious allegations of discriminatory behavior that would not
*  seem to make him a great candidate to have his name emblazoned on NASA's premier super
*  telescope.
*  That's right.
*  I mean, it looks on the face of it pretty bad.
*  Right.
*  What does Hakeem Oluseyi make of these claims?
*  You know, I'm appalled.
*  Right.
*  I'm like, oh, you got to be kidding me.
*  The James Webb Space Telescope, you know, this is bigger than Hubble is going to be.
*  Hakeem is completely taken aback.
*  He's on a Facebook page with other black Latino and gay physicists.
*  Everybody's worked up about this.
*  I saw people in that Facebook group talking about how they felt about seeing this and
*  how they felt about NASA and their nation.
*  And what about the youth coming up?
*  Right.
*  I felt like they too would even be more tortured by it.
*  You're newly coming into this field.
*  This is the latest, greatest data.
*  And you have to deal with someone that you feel, you know, literally would hate you and
*  persecute you if they were alive today.
*  And there is a request, because he is a prominent physicist, that Hakeem join them in denouncing
*  this and pushing NASA to do something to change this.
*  And that request is basically take Webb's name off the telescope.
*  Off the telescope, yes.
*  And Hakeem gives that some thought.
*  So the first thing I do is I decide, let me research this, you know, not deeply, just
*  do a Google search.
*  And I found another article that had been written five, six months earlier by Dan Savage
*  in Seattle that basically said the same thing.
*  But I still know that I don't know until I confirm for myself.
*  Right.
*  But I'm certainly sympathetic to it, because if it is true, this is terrible.
*  And then says to himself, you know, if I'm going to do this, I want to know what the
*  real story is here.
*  And so?
*  So as fate would have it, he takes a job at NASA.
*  And when he gets there, he goes into the office of some of his higher ups and he says, look,
*  you know, what do we make of this?
*  I took it to the head of strategic communications and I said, hey, are you aware of this?
*  And they said, no.
*  Oh, my goodness.
*  Let's go talk to Gregory Robinson, who basically led the James Webb Space Telescope to completion.
*  He was concerned.
*  He's like, oh, this is not good.
*  Let's look into this.
*  And he said, Hakeem, please send me everything you have.
*  And so I sent him the two articles.
*  I sent him the Wikipedia article.
*  And that's all I could find up to that point.
*  And so I had another meeting with him a week later and he said, Hakeem, you know, this
*  does not provide any actual evidence of what happened.
*  All I see here is accusations.
*  Would you mind looking into it and finding out what actually happened?
*  And I said, sure, I'd love to.
*  Right.
*  Because I had the exact same curiosity and I love the research.
*  So, you know, that sounds great.
*  And according to Hakeem, they tell him, would you please take a look at it?
*  So what starts as a kind of personal curiosity about who James Webb really was and what he
*  did is now becoming kind of official business from NASA.
*  Get to the bottom of this.
*  Yes.
*  At this point, it's Hakeem with certainly the help of NASA opening some doors and starting
*  to really delve into the archives.
*  So once empowered to carry out this inquiry, what does Hakeem find?
*  He starts researching the entire life story of James Webb and he discovers the biography
*  of a lifelong high level technocrat.
*  And after World War II, Webb was asked by President Harry Truman to go to the State
*  Department and help in what is essentially a global battle with communism.
*  Webb gets there just as the Red Scare is really taking off in the United States with
*  accusations that many people at the State Department are either communist sympathizers
*  or closet communists.
*  An accusation that could and did destroy the careers of thousands of people.
*  Thousands of people.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  It was an absolutely toxic accusation and it destroyed many, many lives.
*  Layer on top of that, the Republican senators were leading the Red Scare.
*  Also were going after State Department officials as homosexuals.
*  And that was a sort of a double mark of cane for anyone working at the State Department.
*  The accusation being that at that time, if you were homosexual, that would have made
*  you sort of doubly susceptible to being blackmailed, to possibly being turned into a double agent.
*  I should say there's no proof that this ever happened with anyone, but that was certainly
*  the, in that day and age, the late 1940s, that was the anxiety.
*  Yes.
*  And this becomes known as the Lavender Scare.
*  And the allegation is that James Webb was a central actor in this controversy.
*  That he really led the prosecution from within the State Department, working hand in hand
*  with Republican senators in going after and purging gay employees at the State Department.
*  And what specific evidence is put forward about Webb's role in this Lavender Scare?
*  Well, it's twofold.
*  One, there's this quote that he allegedly wrote in a government report and it goes like
*  this.
*  He said,
*  As kind of a justification for forcing out gay workers.
*  Precisely.
*  The second is that Webb personally fired 91 gay employees from the State Department.
*  Serious claims.
*  Serious claims, and if true, you can understand very much why people today would look at that
*  with a sense of horror.
*  And what does Hakim find about all this?
*  So he systematically goes about this.
*  He delves into the NASA archives.
*  He delves into the congressional archives.
*  And after reading every piece of information on Webb, he still can't find any evidence
*  that Webb wrote this damning bigoted quote.
*  But eventually he does find the quote.
*  And this exact quote that was horrible, that was put in his name, appeared in a Senate
*  report, not in James Webb's words.
*  Webb didn't write it.
*  It's actually from a report issued by the Senate that Webb had absolutely nothing to
*  do with.
*  What about the second accusation that Webb fired gay employees?
*  It wasn't James Webb.
*  Put simply, he didn't do that.
*  So it was a case of mistaken identity.
*  That appeared to be the case to me.
*  Everything was done by John Purifor and Carlisle Humelsine.
*  Who were two other employees at the State Department.
*  It was done by other officials at the State Department who were essentially in charge
*  of working with the United States Senate in prosecuting both this Red Scare and the Lavender
*  Scare, the Lavender Purge.
*  So in other words, getting rid of people both because they might be communist sympathizers
*  and because they're gay.
*  You know, James Webb was the undersecretary of state.
*  They were like deputy undersecretary of state.
*  So what Hakeem has found is that the central allegations that first materialized in those
*  articles he had read a few years earlier and drummed up all this anger at Webb, that those
*  central allegations are basically not accurate.
*  That's correct.
*  And what's also particularly interesting is he finds in looking at Webb's tenure at NASA
*  in the 1960s that Webb had played a key role in helping to racially integrate this massive
*  agency, particularly at its famed research facilities in Huntsville, Alabama.
*  The South.
*  The South.
*  And here it's very important to understand historical context.
*  George Wallace is the arch segregationist governor of Alabama, absolutely opposed to
*  any idea of integrating federal agencies on his watch in Alabama puts a lot of pressure
*  on Webb and President Johnson not to do this.
*  And Webb says, no, we're going to integrate this agency.
*  He even at one point threatens to move key parts of that facility out of Alabama, which
*  is a strong shot across the bow to Alabama.
*  Right.
*  And it's extremely prominent and powerful segregationist governor.
*  Right.
*  And in the end, George Wallace backed down.
*  When you come across this or you're told of this background, how does it make you feel?
*  I have to be honest in the sense that it did endear me to Webb a little bit to see that
*  he stood up for African Americans in that way.
*  That was close to my heart.
*  NASA, Kennedy, Johnson, Webb, they were doing the right thing.
*  So according to Hakeem's research, not only is Webb not a bigot, he is actively working
*  to make the United States government more inclusive.
*  Yes.
*  Once I had those two things together, I loved Webb now.
*  And what does Hakeem do with this information that clearly undercuts everything that's being
*  said in this moment about James Webb?
*  Well, first, of course, he goes back and he tells NASA what he's found.
*  Then he writes an article in which he lays out at some length all of his findings.
*  And he's tough in that piece.
*  I mean, he says, look, there have been accusations made by essentially people within my community,
*  that is physicists, that he is a homophobe and had led this lavender perch.
*  And he's saying that's all wrong.
*  And in fact, his article was entitled, was NASA's historic leader, James Webb, a bigot?
*  And can you read me your conclusion?
*  Sure.
*  Let me find it.
*  Hakeem Oluweshe Webb.
*  That'll find it.
*  Yes.
*  I wrote, in full disclosure, I have never met James Webb, who died in 1992.
*  I have no idea what was in his heart and mind.
*  But what I can say conclusively is that there is zero evidence that Webb is guilty of the
*  allegations against him.
*  And he makes very clear no, no, and no.
*  He's very unequivocal about what he found.
*  When you hit publish on that essay, what did you expect?
*  Do you think there would be blowback?
*  I did not expect blowback, not at all.
*  I thought there would be a big sigh of relief from the astronomy community and we'd move
*  forward.
*  And what was the initial reaction?
*  Well, the initial reaction was exactly that.
*  There was like immediately, you know, 400 or so astronomers, quote, tweeted that article
*  with, hey, now we can move on.
*  It's not true.
*  But then a few days later, things changed drastically.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Michael, what does Hakim mean when he says that the initial reaction to his piece changes
*  drastically?
*  At first, many physicists look at his article, look at the research, and there's a sense
*  of relief.
*  Oh, OK, we don't have to worry about that.
*  We have not named this spectacular telescope after a homophobe.
*  Then the criticism comes and it is aimed at Hakim personally and at his historical research.
*  And one of my colleagues who I had known since 2008 published an article with the title,
*  The Straits Are Here to Save Us, about me and this article and this research, you know,
*  and I'm just like, whoa.
*  This element boils down to who are you, a straight male physicist, to tell us, queer,
*  gay physicists and employees of NASA and other universities, what Webb was about?
*  Who were you to tell us our history?
*  This is basically a criticism that Hakim is not qualified as a non-gay, non-queer person
*  to even carry out this inquiry.
*  Yes, not qualified by dint of his identity.
*  You know, and I'm just like, whoa, first off, I thought we had a cordial working relationship.
*  Why, you know, why are you dissing me like this personally?
*  And what about the historical critique?
*  Because from everything you've said, his research is pretty clear cut and it's pretty compelling.
*  Well, they say that my research changes nothing.
*  All I did was look at a quote and who actually said it, but that was it, right?
*  And, you know.
*  Look, critics say he missed a few things, including something that happened in the early
*  1960s when Webb was chief administrator at NASA.
*  A gay employee at NASA was caught in a sting by police in Washington, D.C. and was later
*  fired by NASA.
*  And the accusation was that Webb should have known about this, could have known about this,
*  and should have stopped it.
*  Because he ran.
*  Because he ran NASA.
*  And what does Hakim say about that?
*  Hakim points out several things.
*  One is there's no particular reason to think that Webb would have known about this.
*  This was not a top employee at NASA.
*  NASA is a very large federal agency.
*  But even more to the point.
*  The head of federal agencies take directions from above.
*  There was an executive order signed by President Eisenhower and that was enforced for the next
*  20 years, saying that openly gay Americans could not work for the federal government.
*  It was not a NASA policy.
*  It was a federal government wide policy that applied to every federal agency.
*  It was wrong minded.
*  It was wrong minded.
*  I 100% it was wrong.
*  And they're bad actors and we know their names.
*  And James Webb is not among them.
*  So the relevant context is that Webb may or may not have known about this firing.
*  There's no evidence he played a role in it and that the firing more or less followed
*  the law of the land.
*  Yes, he would have literally had to disobey an executive order by the President of the
*  United States.
*  They didn't admit that he didn't do what he was accused of.
*  They just said, oh, what Hakim does not understand is that Webb was complicit because he was
*  in management.
*  And this gets to this broader critique of Hakim's work.
*  That James Webb had a responsibility at various places, both when he was at the State Department
*  and when he was at NASA to speak up for gay rights and to speak up for gay Americans.
*  And that if he failed to do so, he had failed morally.
*  He had failed in his moral obligation to history.
*  Hmm.
*  So this is intriguing.
*  This criticism of Hakim's research is that whether or not Webb himself did any of the
*  things he'd been accused of doing, which Hakim has found he didn't, the fact that as a leader,
*  he didn't do more to stop it makes him worthy of condemnation.
*  Yes, precisely.
*  There's a word in historiography, presentism, which is this idea that one can apply the
*  moral lens of our current day to past events.
*  I mean, this is raised around our civil war.
*  It's raised around any kind of really urgent, certainly the civil rights movement.
*  In this case, it would be applied to James Webb in saying, look, in 1949, 1950, when
*  you're at the State Department and gay employees, or potentially gay employees, because no one
*  quite knows who they are, are coming under attack, that you should have understood this
*  as a moral civil rights issue and stood up and said something and resigned if you needed
*  to.
*  Let me give an example.
*  There's a professor at the University of New Hampshire, Dr. Chanda Prescott Weinstein,
*  a well-known physicist.
*  She's been very critical of Hakim, and she argues that James Webb, in fact, had a choice
*  As she wrote, he could have been a radical freedom fighter and simply refused to serve
*  in the Truman administration.
*  So how should we think about an argument like that?
*  Well, the problem is that if you talk to historians, including some very prominent gay historians
*  who've studied this period, I mean, there was not a gay rights movement at that time.
*  In this sort of a case, it's seen as asking people to anticipate where history is moving
*  in a way that is simply kind of beyond their kin at that time.
*  In 1949, 1950, to have expected essentially someone to intuit that there would be a gay
*  rights movement that would arise in the next two and three and four decades and come to
*  flower is not reasonable.
*  What is their argument?
*  Michael, no matter what intellectual framework you subscribe to when it comes to James Webb,
*  it feels like what has happened in the case of Hakim's research is that an original critique
*  has been transformed and changed.
*  And in a sense, the goalposts have moved.
*  First, the accusation was that he did something very wrong.
*  That was disproven.
*  And so the critique transforms into he was complicit.
*  So how does Hakim start to think about that?
*  I mean, Hakim finds himself frustrated, frankly, at this shifting of the argument from one
*  thing to the next to the next.
*  They started with he initiated it.
*  He's a homophobe.
*  Then they pull back to he's complicit.
*  Then they get a hint of something.
*  It's never quite clear where this ends.
*  And at some point, Hakim, a scientist, a man who loves to research, starts to realize,
*  you know, facts are probably not going to be the end of this.
*  You know, there's not going to be one finding one set of facts that is kind of going to
*  put this to rest.
*  So sometimes the truth of the data is so obvious, but because of politics or some other reason,
*  people will claim that they don't see what is obvious.
*  And that's why this episode feels very relevant to our current cultural moment.
*  And there is, I think, indisputably, a growing tendency by progressive forces in our culture
*  to revisit the past with disapproving eyes.
*  It often comes from a place of justifiable anger over a historical wrong.
*  But at times it can seem uninterested and pretty unforgiving of the values that existed
*  in the past.
*  And it can be dismissive of the facts and the nuances that don't conform to the ultimate
*  judgments of those who disapprove of it.
*  Does that feel right?
*  Yes.
*  I see this all the time in my writing and reporting and in talking with Hakim.
*  I mean, he confronted, in a sense, the conundrum, right?
*  I mean, on the one hand, it's enormously frustrating to see facts ignored or perhaps shunned aside.
*  On the other hand, as he talks about himself, he gets it.
*  He gets this sense of pain and aggrievement as you look back at history and try to make
*  sense of history.
*  You know, when I first saw this, I thought about what if it was me?
*  What if I lived in my town and there was this Confederate statue?
*  When this dude, not only was he Confederate, he was like an overseer and a murderer of
*  African people who were enslaved back then.
*  This is what I think my whole life.
*  And now this white dude in the community goes and does the research and says, hey, you know
*  what?
*  Turns out it wasn't that guy.
*  He didn't do that.
*  And as a matter of fact, he saved the lives of hundreds of Native Americans.
*  I would be in no hurry to unhate that guy, right?
*  If all this time I thought that dude was that evil person, even when I found the truth,
*  I still would feel some kind of way.
*  That's a natural feeling.
*  I get that.
*  So what ends up happening next in Hakeem's story?
*  It takes a decidedly nasty and personal turn.
*  He is offered a job at George Mason University and there is an accusation.
*  What I heard people were saying was that I had sexually harassed a woman at my university.
*  I was at Florida Tech.
*  And that in my federal grants that I received, that I had absconded with federal money, that
*  I had stolen money.
*  These accusations are made in a roundabout way on Twitter and in a phone call to another
*  physics professor at George Mason University, who properly takes them to the administration
*  at George Mason.
*  And George Mason in turn gets in touch with the Florida Institute of Technology.
*  It's very important to note that there is no there there.
*  Florida Institute of Technology had investigated these accusations a couple of years earlier
*  and reinvestigated those, found nothing there.
*  I spent a good three weeks of reporting time trying to track down these allegations, talking
*  to many former students and I could find nothing.
*  And nor did Florida Institute of Technology nor did George Mason, which went ahead with
*  its hire.
*  And in fact, Hakeem Oluseyi is now a visiting professor at George Mason.
*  I have to point out something that I'm sure occurred to you, Michael, while you were reporting
*  is at this point in the story, you're looking into the reputation of someone who was attacked
*  after looking into the reputation of someone else who was attacked.
*  And perhaps all these attacks are coming from the same set of sources.
*  Yes.
*  This is the politics of personal destruction that accompany so many disputes these days,
*  where one challenges the consensus around a particular issue and it's not enough to
*  argue with that to say, no, no, no, you're wrong because of X, Y and Z. You need to take
*  that person down and personal reputations are destroyed.
*  It's an unfortunately common aspect of intellectual debate these days.
*  So we know how this story ends, of course.
*  The James Webb Space Telescope is up in the skies.
*  We know it is named the James Webb Space Telescope.
*  But has NASA itself ever officially weighed in on this entire saga and debate about Webb
*  and about his past?
*  Yes, they have.
*  Their in-house historian did a quite complete report that essentially ratified everything
*  Hakeem had found.
*  Now the report's very careful.
*  History's complicated, right?
*  We can't know with 100% certainty what James Webb really believed in his heart.
*  But the report goes through every accusation against him and the historical record just
*  doesn't back those up.
*  So where is Hakeem right now in his career and has any of this in his mind changed his
*  life, changed his trajectory?
*  I think when one goes through a crucible like this, and it was a crucible for Hakeem in
*  his telling, it certainly has left him with a sense of precisely how fraught and charged
*  our cultural moment is.
*  But when I've asked him, if you could go back knowing what you know now, would you still
*  do this?
*  Yeah, I'd definitely do it again.
*  There's not a regret for having looked into this.
*  I think he feels that he did what he felt he had an intellectual obligation to do, which
*  was to look at these charges as clearly as he could and come to some conclusions.
*  That turned out to be right.
*  That turned out to be right, yes.
*  I had no personal connection to James Webb.
*  There was nothing that made me want to exonerate James Webb.
*  There was nothing that made me feel like I could somehow gain an advantage from doing
*  this.
*  If anything, I knew that there was only a downside.
*  There was nothing in it for me, period.
*  But once I found out the truth, I was now bound to reveal that truth.
*  It's my duty.
*  It's my responsibility.
*  My honor could have it no other way.
*  In reflecting on this whole saga, you have to imagine that there are other consensuses
*  — that's the right word out there — that aren't right.
*  Other moments where lots of people think that a James Webb, someone like that, did wrong.
*  But there isn't a Hakim-like figure devoting the time and, in this case, reputational cost
*  to challenging those narratives because it's just not worth it for them, as we can see.
*  In that sense, it strikes me that Hakim's story is inspiring.
*  The lengths he went, the years he devoted to it, the risks he was willing to tolerate.
*  Or it's a kind of extreme cautionary tale because who wants to endure all of that just
*  to correct the record for some dead guy?
*  Right?
*  Absolutely.
*  And in fact, in my reporting, I talked to many physicists who did not want to go on
*  the record talking about this.
*  They said to me, you know, Hakim got it right and I ain't going there because if I go there,
*  I'm going to get attacked.
*  And one hears this, frankly, all the time in academia.
*  And I know that there are those, you know, number of very prominent, you know, liberal
*  scholars and activists who say that this doesn't happen.
*  But I'm just saying, like, I'm in those conversations.
*  And when you say this is happening, what you mean is a form of fear and self-censorship
*  that makes people fear articulating the truth.
*  Yes.
*  So to that few right, Hakim Oluseyi is either a inspiring tale of an intellectual who stood
*  up for what he believed in and what he had found, or he's a cautionary tale, as you say,
*  of where you don't want to go.
*  Right.
*  Now, the other way to think of this entire story, Michael, is that the people who are
*  mad about the Webb telescope from the start were making a larger point and that a factual
*  error here and there, a reputation that maybe gets trampled, isn't ultimately as important
*  as communicating a message about fairness and equality within an institution like the
*  State Department or NASA, and that you don't make omelets without breaking eggs.
*  You don't change the world without occasionally bruising people.
*  Yeah, I suppose if you're not the egg being broken, that's a perhaps a more comfortable
*  position.
*  But I think it's fair to say that we venture into dangerous waters if we say that, well,
*  truth can be sacrificed for a greater good.
*  It seems to me, in looking at the life of Hakim Oluşeyi, you see the downside risk
*  pretty profoundly.
*  Oh, Michael, thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  The Times reports that Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, whose prolonged absence imperiled
*  Democrats agenda in Congress, has returned to work despite a set of serious medical setbacks
*  that have left her in poor health.
*  Feinstein was first hospitalized with shingles in February, which spread to her face and
*  neck, causing vision and balance impairments and facial paralysis.
*  At the same time, it brought on an undisclosed case of encephalitis, a swelling of the brain
*  that can cause memory loss, language problems and bouts of confusion.
*  The new information suggests Feinstein was unready to resume work and is now struggling
*  to function in the job.
*  And Disney is pulling the plug on a $1 billion office complex in Florida following a set
*  of relentless politically motivated attacks on the company by the state's Republican
*  governor, Ron DeSantis.
*  The office complex would have brought more than 2000 jobs to the region with an average
*  salary of $120,000.
*  Disney's decision highlights the economic risks of DeSantis's presidential aspirations.
