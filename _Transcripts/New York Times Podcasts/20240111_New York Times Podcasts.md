*  From the New York Times, I'm Catherine Benholdt in for Sabrina Teranisi.
*  This is the Daily.
*  A recent string of attacks across the Middle East has raised concerns that the war between
*  her mass and Israel is spreading and might put pressure on other countries like Iran
*  at the United States to get more involved.
*  Today, my colleague Eric Schmidt, on the risk that the conflict is becoming an even wider
*  war and the efforts underway to prevent that.
*  It's Thursday, January 11th.
*  Eric, welcome back to the show.
*  Thank you very much.
*  From the moment that her mass attacked Israel on October 7th and Israel responding to Gaza,
*  the United States has been very concerned about an escalation of this war into the region.
*  In the last few weeks, there have been a series of strikes and counter strikes in different
*  parts of the Middle East and in the Red Sea.
*  I come to you, Eric, as our national security correspondent, to ask, is this the moment
*  this conflict is turning into that wider regional war that we've all been worrying about?
*  Well, Catherine, I think you're right.
*  This is a moment of concern.
*  Ever since the October 7th attacks in Israel, the Biden administration has been relentlessly
*  focused not only on responding to that war, but specifically on how to avoid having the
*  war widened beyond Gaza.
*  The President himself and his top aides feel that a wider war in this region would be an
*  economic disaster, a security catastrophe, and would be very damaging going into an election
*  year to have that kind of conflict running, particularly with one in which it would be
*  hard to see how it would be contained.
*  From the very beginning, the President ordered the first of what became two aircraft carriers
*  and doubled the number of Americans strike aircraft in the region, basically to warn off
*  anybody else who would try and take advantage and try and widen the conflict in the region.
*  So let's unpack some of this.
*  It's messy.
*  Talk us through these recent events, Eric.
*  What has happened beyond Israel and Gaza?
*  Yeah.
*  I think all you have to really do is look at the events of the last 10 days or so to really
*  underscore this concern about a wider regional war in the Middle East.
*  And first of all, I think it's important to lay out that one reason the events of the
*  last few weeks are concerning to US officials is because most of them are tied to Iran in
*  some way.
*  And the concern here is that Iran may not want to get directly involved with it as all
*  these proxies that it'll activate in Lebanon, in Iraq, in Syria, in Yemen itself.
*  So for instance, tonight, a senior Hamas leader is dead and it's serious concerns the
*  war in the Middle East is about to get bigger.
*  On January 2, the deputy leader of Hamas, Saleh Al-Aruh, and two leaders of its armed
*  wing were killed in an explosion in a suburb of Beirut, Lebanon.
*  Israel was responsible for the attacks according to US and Western officials.
*  Who does it benefit?
*  It benefits the Israelis to kill him and they did so almost certainly hard to imagine
*  anybody else.
*  This is significant in a couple of ways.
*  One is Israel's fight against Hamas.
*  It goes outside of Gaza itself and they're reaching into Lebanon.
*  But more significantly, it's on the home turf of his Bola, which is the largest and most
*  formidable proxy that Iran has in the region.
*  It's been financed and equipped by Iran for years and years.
*  And it's very much of a concern there.
*  In a statement released by Hezbollah, it says its hand is on the trigger.
*  So that's kind of the first thing.
*  The second thing is the US military killed a high-ranking Iraqi militial leader in Baghdad
*  today.
*  You have a mysterious explosion in Iraq.
*  The Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hans condemned the bombings.
*  On January 4, it turns out a US Special Operations drone killed a senior figure in an Iran-linked
*  militant group that is actually part of Iraq's security apparatus there.
*  The Ministry, quote, reserves its right to take a firm stance and all necessary measures
*  to deter anyone who tries to harm its territory.
*  But American officials defended this strike as a self-defense attack against a key commander
*  in this militia that has carried out more than 120 attacks against US troops inside of
*  Iraq and Syria since the October 7th assault.
*  So this is very much of a concern for American officials there for their own personnel.
*  Hezbollah is claiming a top commander has been killed in an Israeli air strike in Beirut.
*  Then on January 8th, you have a strike in southern Lebanon again in Hezbollah's stronghold
*  killed a Rod-1 Force commander.
*  This is a strike that's been carried out by Israeli strike aircraft.
*  Clearly, the Israelis are deliberately trying to send a message to Hezbollah that they are
*  in no mood to be messed around on the border then.
*  And basically, this is kind of the latest in a series of back and forth cross-border attacks
*  between Lebanese Hezbollah and Israel that the United States is very concerned could turn
*  into a much wider campaign.
*  And today, that Hezbollah could ramp up their strikes against northern Israel following
*  this strike that took place this morning.
*  I think at the moment, with tensions as they are, it's more likely that things will
*  flare up.
*  And this Rod-1 Force is basically the military, the sort of most elite military wing of
*  Hispahla.
*  That's right.
*  And they're right up on the border.
*  And this is a big concern for Israel because Israel has had to evacuate tens of thousands
*  of residents in the northern part of the country because that territory is coming under
*  consistent rocket missile attacks from Hezbollah.
*  Wow.
*  Before October 7th, this was the area that Israel and the United States, frankly, were
*  most concerned about.
*  So once you have the October 7th attacks, once you have Iran activating its proxies, Israel,
*  of course, is very concerned that a next step might be some kind of retaliation by Hezbollah.
*  So far, that has not happened.
*  And intelligence sources indicate that Hezbollah does not want to get engaged in a wider
*  war, but this escalation that we've seen across border attacks could lead to a miscalculation,
*  could lead to one side of the other deciding they have to go forward.
*  And that could basically engulf that part of the country in a second front.
*  In the last area where we've seen a lot of activity is in the Red Sea.
*  Houthi militants have launched 25 attacks on commercial ships since mid-November, including
*  one today.
*  This is this key waterway where 12% of the world's commerce flows through it.
*  And what you've had since the October 7th assault is Houthi rebels in Yemen have launched
*  a series of attack drones, missiles, and rockets at commercial shipping, basically saying
*  and vowing to continue these attacks against commercial shipping until Israel withdraws from
*  Gaza and ends the war there.
*  This has had a dramatic impact on the shipping lanes.
*  Five of the world's largest shipping companies have announced their suspending sailings through
*  the route.
*  While Houthis say they're targeting Israel-bound ships, but actually they're firing indiscriminately.
*  So what you have here is the Houthis, which are another one of these proxies, launching
*  a series of attacks, the most recent of which came on Tuesday night.
*  This is Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have carried out their largest attacks so far on shipping
*  lanes.
*  The Ministry of Defense says a British warship and US warships fought them off.
*  And this was significant because just last week, the US and its allies have warned the
*  group to stop or face potential military action.
*  The United States and a dozen other countries basically gave the Houthis an ultimatum.
*  Season to cis, these kind of attacks or else, was kind of the ultimatum.
*  Now the coalition did not specifically mention military strikes, but our reporting indicates
*  that the Pentagon has been drafting target lists of Houthi radar sites and missile storage
*  areas and all sorts of things should President Biden and some of the other coalition countries
*  that are involved here decide that they want to launch retaliatory strikes.
*  In the meantime, the United States has led an effort to create a maritime security force.
*  These are ships that are specifically designed to knock down these attacks that are coming
*  in from the Houthis and they buy a relatively successful, the Houthis have seized one container
*  ship and still hold it in the Red Sea.
*  But you now have a coalition of more than 20 countries operating ships in the Red Sea
*  and sometimes escorting commercial vessels through the waterway to allow them to reach
*  their destination.
*  Okay, so it really does sound like the answer to that earlier question I asked about a
*  white-a-war, is this it?
*  Yes, it feels like things have really spread in the way that people feared when the war
*  first started.
*  Well, again, it's certainly a central worry for President Biden and his top aides in Washington
*  and for other allied officials who were involved in this conflict.
*  It's a central concern for the U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who is currently in
*  the region on his fourth official visit there since the war started.
*  But despite these incidents and this kind of stacking up that we saw so ominously in
*  the last 10 days or so, there are some kind of large forces at work that may keep these
*  incidents from spiraling out of control.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Eric, you mentioned some big forces that are keeping this conflict from spinning out
*  of control.
*  Walk me through those.
*  So there are at least two factors.
*  One of them is the news from earlier this week.
*  The news is that it's a central announcement that it plans to wind down some of its intensive
*  operations in Gaza, particularly in northern Gaza by the end of January.
*  But what does scaling back actually mean, exactly given that they just killed his ball
*  of leader?
*  Right.
*  So what it means in Gaza at least is you would see if this actually happens, a lessening
*  of this massive aerial bombardment that Israel has conducted, particularly in the northern
*  parts of Gaza.
*  And you would see much more targeted raids by special operations forces going after
*  Hamas leaders, a specific operations going after the tunnel network that's still there.
*  This is something that they have told American officials and they've announced publicly
*  just as early as this week.
*  Now, interestingly enough, these really officials are really giving two messages.
*  There's one message to the international community.
*  That's what we just talked about.
*  They're going to be ramping down some of these heavier operations, particularly in the
*  north.
*  That's to basically assuage some of the international community's concerns about the loss of life
*  in more than 23,000 civilians who've been killed there.
*  But there's a very different message that these same leaders are giving to the Israeli public.
*  And that is the war is not going to end.
*  This is going to go on for months, if not years.
*  We are going to track hunt down and capture all the leaders responsible for the October
*  7th attack and we'll do whatever is necessary to restore security to the country and reestablish
*  deterrence in this area.
*  So it's really a twin focused dual messages, one for the international community, one for
*  the domestic Israeli audience.
*  Got it.
*  So how do you explain this dual messaging, Eric?
*  Well, I think it's the Netanyahu government obviously responding to the heavy criticism
*  and the pressure from the United States and other governments with the growing number
*  of civilian casualties.
*  It's just untenable and the pressures that those governments are facing back home to
*  continue their support of Israel.
*  At the same time, you have Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wanting to signal
*  that we're not scaling back on the larger ambition to eradicate this terrorist organization
*  that was responsible for the attacks.
*  Nor are we giving up on recovering all the hostages.
*  You said that there were two factors.
*  What's the second element here that might slow down or stop an outright regional war
*  breaking out?
*  So the second one is actually kind of paradoxical, but it's Iran itself.
*  Iran wants this kind of chaos, but it wants a kind of controlled chaos or a controlled
*  escalation.
*  It is the puppet master for most of these proxies that it's supported and equipped over
*  the years, but it's also in Iran's interest.
*  They've made this fairly clear that it doesn't want the conflicts to spin out of control
*  and then drag either its principle proxy, has bowled into war or even worse in Gulf Iran
*  and a direct conflict with the United States or Israel itself.
*  Why not?
*  Well, I think this has a lot to do with the Iranian government's popularity or lack there
*  of and the weakness domestically.
*  One of the things we haven't talked about was in the midst of this series of events that
*  happened in the last 10 days, there were twin explosions at a commemoration ceremony for
*  the death of a very top Iranian general, General Sulamani.
*  This killed more than 100 people in this procession in a city in Iran.
*  Immediately there was some suspicion that Israel might be behind it, but in the end it
*  turned out to be an arm of Islamic State.
*  This was actually a terrorist strike that kind of revealed perhaps some of this deficiencies
*  in the domestic security apparatus inside of Iran that they couldn't protect their own
*  people against one of the worst domestic terrorist attacks in Iran's history.
*  So this idea of controlled chaos that you mentioned basically means that Iran wants
*  to make life difficult for Israel and the US, but it doesn't want a regional war because
*  that would pose an existential risk to the regime.
*  It's basically about survival.
*  That's right.
*  You know, they don't want, has Bola dragged into another very costly war like they were
*  in 2006 that ultimately could force Iran's hand to support them, could drag the United
*  States into support Israel and something like that.
*  So you know, these factors that Iran can't totally control that could heat this war
*  up.
*  And I think most immediately besides what we see in Lebanon and his Bola is this potential
*  conflict with the Houthis because that is the proxy that the Iranians have the least
*  amount of operational control over.
*  So basically all of this adds up to a situation with a lot of uncertainty including how much
*  control Iran has over its proxies and perhaps also how much control the US has in the mix
*  here.
*  That's right.
*  And if you look at some specific examples, this is where the concern really lies in miscalculations
*  in one form or another that people can't necessarily predict.
*  Another factor that keeps the White House up at night and they really don't like to talk
*  about it very much is what happens if American service members are killed.
*  As I mentioned before, there have been over 60 that have been injured at least one critically
*  in these rocket and drone and missile attacks that the militias have fired at troops in
*  Iraq and Syria.
*  But there have been a number of close calls that the Pentagon has not wanted to talk about
*  at all.
*  There was one instance where a missile landed in a barracks and it failed to explode.
*  Had it done so, it would probably would have killed a dozen or more troops that were
*  there.
*  There have been a couple of other instances like this just by sheer luck that some of these
*  attacks, which aren't necessarily always the most precisely targeted by these militias,
*  could have killed American forces on the ground.
*  And if that were to happen, that would immediately put pressure on President Biden to respond,
*  not just perhaps to the proxies who actually carried out these strikes, but perhaps against
*  Iran itself for providing the equipment, the supplies, perhaps even the intelligence,
*  that enabled those strikes to happen.
*  But as you said, the U.S. is also sending more troops and warships to the region.
*  So it could be creating a scenario where they're increasingly making themselves targets
*  in this.
*  Well, perhaps, but the administration has been very clear that the additional ships, the
*  two aircraft carriers, one of which is since left, been replaced by some marine ships,
*  as well as twice the number of attack aircraft that have been sent to the Middle East and
*  the Persian Gulf regions in October 7th.
*  Those are there as a deterrent.
*  And by all accounts, that deterrent has worked.
*  It's worked at least so far.
*  And Iran has gotten the message and has tried to calibrate its responses through its proxies.
*  But as you say, as you have more troops in the area, particularly ships and planes, those
*  are more targets.
*  So Eric, the jury is still out on whether this will turn into a full-blown regional war
*  war.
*  But from everything you've said, it's already pretty clear that this war and its ripple
*  effects are reshaping the Middle East.
*  Yes, I think that's right.
*  We've seen, after years, it being an international pariah, Iran is reasserting itself.
*  It's obviously the center of this post-October 7 conflict and managing its proxies in the region.
*  You have the United States being drawn back into the Middle East after, for years, trying
*  to kind of wind down after the long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and pivot to the end
*  of Pacific.
*  And you have Israel trying to obviously reestablish security for its population and deterrence
*  in the region after this historic attack.
*  You have efforts, I think, on all sides.
*  The U.S. side, even the Iranian side, the Israeli side, to try and contain this.
*  But there could be miscalculations that lead any one of those actors down a road and one
*  that they're not planning on that they don't desire that could drag them and the other
*  actors in the Middle East into a much wider conflict.
*  Thank you very much, Eric.
*  Thank you.
*  On Wednesday, after American and British warships intercepted the latest barrage of drones
*  and missiles fired by Houthi rebels at commercial ships in the Red Sea, Secretary of State
*  Anthony Blinken warned that the U.S. and its allies would respond.
*  We've made clear, we've been clear with more than 20 other countries that if this continues,
*  as it did yesterday, there will be consequences and I'm going to leave it at that.
*  The attack, one of the largest staged by the Houthis since October 7th, came a week after
*  the U.S. led coalition gave an ultimatum to the rebels to seize their near-daily attacks
*  or face retaliation.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Wednesday, President Biden's son, Hunter Biden, surprised Republicans on the House
*  of the U.S.
*  and the House of the U.S.
*  and the House of the U.S.
*  and the House of the U.S.
*  and the House of the U.S.
*  and the House of the U.S.
*  and the House of the U.S.
*  and the House of the U.S.
*  and the House of the U.S.
*  and the House of the U.S.
*  and the House of the U.S.
*  and the House of the U.S.
*  and the House of the U.S.
*  and the House of the U.S.
*  and the House of the U.S.
*  who are the epitome of White privilege
*  coming into the Oversight Committee
*  spitting in our face, ignoring a congressional subpoena to be deposed.
*  What are you afraid of?
*  Her remarks drew a rebuke from a Democrat on the committee,
*  representative Jared Moskovitz of Florida,
*  who replied that Hunter Biden
*  would be happy to testify
*  so long as it wasn't public.
*  Mr. Chairman, Point of Inquiry.
*  Mr. Chairman.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Mr. Chairman, Port of Inquiry.
*  Mr. Chairman.
*  If the general lady wants to hear from Hunter Biden, we can hear from him right now,
*  Mr. Chairman. Let's take a vote and hear from Hunter Biden.
*  And after former Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey suspended his presidential campaign,
*  two of the remaining Republican candidates, Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley, clashed during
*  the last debate before the Iowa caucuses.
*  We're going to find out tonight that there's going to be a lot of Ron's lies that have happened.
*  There are at least a couple of dozen so far that he's done.
*  So what we're going to do is rather than have him go and tell you all these lies,
*  you can go to DeSantisLies.com.
*  Well, Ms. Haley called Mr. DeSantis a liar.
*  He described her as a liberal and conservative clothing who could not be trusted
*  with the values of the Republican Party.
*  Nikki Haley is basically a carbon copy of what Biden is, the difference.
*  Donald Trump, who is also competing for the Republican nomination, appeared at the same time
*  in a town hall on Fox News and announced that he had made his decision on a running mate,
*  though when asked who it was, he did not give a name.
