*  Amongst philosophers who studied dementia, there's this story that gets told over and over
*  again.
*  And it's about a woman named Margo.
*  Margo was a 55-year-old woman who suffered from early onset Alzheimer's disease.
*  She couldn't recognize anyone around her.
*  She spent her days painting and listening to music.
*  She read mystery novels too.
*  Often the same book day after day, the mystery always remained mysterious because she would
*  forget it.
*  But despite her illness, or maybe even because of it, Margo was very happy.
*  The Margo story presents philosophers with this riddle.
*  Imagine that years ago when Margo was fully competent, she wrote out a formal document
*  explaining that if she ever developed Alzheimer's disease, she would not want any life-saving
*  medical treatment.
*  And more than that, she would want to be killed as soon and as painlessly as possible.
*  This poses a question which version of the Margo should be listened to, the then Margo
*  before she got sick, the then Margo who never would want to live that way, or the now
*  Margo who's sitting before us and who is by all accounts.
*  Happy.
*  In other words, who is the authentic Margo?
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Babaro.
*  This is the Daily.
*  Across the United States, millions of families are confronting a seemingly impossible question.
*  When dementia changes a relative, how much should they accommodate their new personality
*  and their new desires?
*  Today, Times Magazine correspondent Katie Engelhardt with One Family's Experience.
*  It's Friday, January 26th.
*  Katie, how did you first discover this story?
*  So I spent a number of years reporting on issues related to older Americans and I've been
*  particularly interested in dementia and cognitive impairment.
*  And this story actually found me because I've been writing about the subject.
*  I was receiving a lot of emails from people who had dementia, who's loved ones had it.
*  And there was one that really stood out to me.
*  And that was an email from two women, Chris and Julie Narellias who were writing to tell
*  me the story of their mother.
*  And what was the story that they told you?
*  The story that they described was effectively one of elder abuse.
*  In this case, what they were describing wasn't physical abuse or even kind of direct financial
*  abuse, but something a little softer, more like psychological pressure, more like taking
*  advantage of someone's cognitive weakness in order to convince that person that she wants
*  something she doesn't really.
*  The more I reported on this story, the more complicated it seemed.
*  This wasn't a straightforward story of elder abuse with good guys and bad guys.
*  This was a lot more complicated.
*  We can all hear each other.
*  Yeah.
*  Great.
*  Thank you so much for being willing to try to get.
*  So the first thing I did was call these sisters, Chris and Julie Narellias.
*  And that really started two years of conversation with them.
*  Sure.
*  Starting someplace for Chris and Julia are separated by a few years, but they act almost
*  like twins.
*  Oh wow.
*  Well, you're going to put them up.
*  Wait.
*  They look similar.
*  They have virtually the same voice.
*  They complete each other's sentences.
*  And they told me a lot about their family.
*  The Narellias family grew up in Denison, Iowa, a town of around 8,000 people surrounded
*  on all sides by corn fields.
*  Their father Bill was sort of a prominent figure around town.
*  He was a lawyer and a landowner.
*  But we spent most of our time talking about their mother, Diane Narellias.
*  My mom was really the center of our family.
*  The sisters described their mother as really the backbone of this happy American family.
*  Dad worked all the time.
*  And so it was up to mom to take care of everything else.
*  And it was a great childhood.
*  She was competent and a big presence in the area.
*  She served on a school board.
*  She drove a school bus.
*  She was on the State Library Board.
*  But she was also a very traditional woman.
*  She was a woman of her time.
*  The mom and dad were married in 1957.
*  So it was very much 1950s.
*  Wife at home with the children, husband working.
*  And she was by her daughter's admission quite happy in that role.
*  It was all very proper and mom took pride in that.
*  And probably would have continued that way if things hadn't derailed.
*  What exactly happened?
*  Things for Diane really changed in 2011.
*  Her husband, Bill died of complications from a broken hip after 53 years of marriage.
*  You have to remember that mom went to nursing school, got out and pretty much married dad.
*  I mean, she was in her early 20s when she had me.
*  So she had never lived alone, been independent or anything.
*  So when she loses this man who has been there for her, her whole life, literally, her adult
*  life, I think she was like lost.
*  I mean, she pretended like don't worry kids, I'll be fine.
*  But I don't think she knew how to do it by herself, especially without a man.
*  And by do it, you mean?
*  Live her life.
*  She made it out like, oh, I feel kind of free now.
*  And I can go and do anything I want.
*  But she really didn't.
*  She just watched television.
*  And then Diane started losing more people.
*  To me, the next thing was my brother's health crisis.
*  Her son, Eric died of cancer at 55.
*  That's her only son.
*  That's one of her children.
*  Her daughter, Julie, who would live next door, divorce, and move to Colorado.
*  Because her support group is kind of, to her mind, I think, abandoned her.
*  She was seeing herself alone.
*  And then almost all of a sudden, a new man appears in her life.
*  And then alone came Denzel.
*  Denzel Nelson.
*  Denzel was known to the family.
*  Denzel Nelson was my father-in-law when I was married to his son.
*  He was actually Julie's ex-husband's father.
*  So man, she'd once been very close with, but hadn't seen much of since her divorce.
*  He always had cowboy boots and a cowboy snap down in a cowboy hat on.
*  He was this kind of stocky cowboy figure.
*  He'd worked as a horse-sueer for most of his life, but it's since retired.
*  I mean, it was a completely different image, you know, in comparison to my father.
*  I mean, there were opposites.
*  He was three times divorced.
*  And actually, because he had no finances, he asked if there was any chance he could live
*  in the hired man's house next door to my mom.
*  And coming off his last divorce, he moved into a little property on the Nurellius farm
*  plot.
*  In exchange for helping maintain the yard, like do the mowing, and help out with yard work
*  and things there that he could help with.
*  By all accounts, he and Diane weren't especially close.
*  Well, she said he was disgusting.
*  He dressed like a hick, mom used to wear a hick, and she just thought he was kind of repulsive.
*  She said he smelled bad.
*  She said he'd stop by for coffee sometimes, and she wished that he wouldn't.
*  So they certainly weren't close by any means.
*  Until seemingly out of nowhere, Diane's views on Denzel completely changed.
*  It was a Sunday.
*  I call mom, and the woman talking to me was not my mom.
*  She was like, I need to tell you something.
*  And then she went on to say, I've invited Denzel to share my life and live in my house with
*  me.
*  I'm sure my mouth dropped open because I was like, what is happening?
*  She goes, I need you to accept him and love him and welcome him into our family because
*  this is what I want.
*  Our mother called them up and sort of presented this as a done deal.
*  Denzel and I are in love.
*  He's moving into the house.
*  He's the love of my life.
*  It was hard.
*  It was hard to swallow.
*  It really was.
*  But Kristen Julie tried to be accepting of this.
*  For mom's sake, we all adapted.
*  So things were okay for a while.
*  And Diane, she seemed happy.
*  She and Denzel started spending their days on these drives.
*  They drive around the state or to different states.
*  They go to antique shows or horse shows or quilt shows.
*  At age 80, Diane was finding a new way to live.
*  But Diane's daughter's also noticed changes in her that they found more worrying.
*  My mom always was a fashionista.
*  She used to make her own clothing suits.
*  Their mother had always been very well dressed, very interested in her appearance.
*  But then I came home and she's wearing jeans with a big wide cowboy belt and this old
*  credit horse breeders baseball cap.
*  All of a sudden she was dressing like a cowboy.
*  And no makeup, no makeup.
*  And I was just like, who are you?
*  And some of the changes were deeper ones.
*  And she said to me one day, you know, I'm trying to be more assertive.
*  Denzel's training me to be more assertive.
*  Kristen Julie really felt like their joyful joyous mother was growing sour.
*  She was being aggressive and mean to people.
*  Even Diane's phone calls with her daughters were changing.
*  They started to be this gradual isolation that mom wasn't calling as much.
*  I call her and oh, she'd be busy.
*  I'll have her call you back.
*  They're finding it harder to reach their mother.
*  She's not answering the phone when she does answer the phone.
*  It seems as if Denzel's always beside her, always sort of coaching her almost on what
*  to say.
*  But I think it was harder and harder for her to understand our conversations when we would
*  talk.
*  I start to feel like their mother is deteriorating in ways they can't quite understand from far
*  away.
*  But it's only in September of 2017 that a doctor finally gives shape to what Diane's daughters
*  sort of both new and couldn't see.
*  I couldn't get a hold of mom and was worried about her.
*  And I got a phone call from Denzel that said mom was in the hospital.
*  He didn't think it was her heart.
*  They weren't sure.
*  Denzel had taken Diane to the emergency room because she felt short of breath.
*  And at the hospital, she was given a cognitive test.
*  She scored poorly.
*  She didn't know the name of the president, for instance.
*  I decided, you know what?
*  I'm going back to Iowa and I got a plane ticket.
*  Chris actually got a plane ticket too, but I got back there before Chris.
*  So I went to the hospital, met with mom.
*  Then Dr. Ingram came in and explained to me that, yeah, your mother, he had diagnosed
*  her with dementia.
*  And it's here at this time that Diane is diagnosed with dementia.
*  That was the day we went to Vicki's house.
*  Vicki was kind of a friend to mom and to us.
*  And we were so shocked.
*  We're sitting at her bar crying.
*  And she's like, well, of course your mom has dementia.
*  We all know that.
*  We've known that for years.
*  It's around the time that she receives that diagnosis that Diane starts rearranging
*  her affairs.
*  That's when Denzel was added to the bank accounts.
*  She gives Denzel her financial power of attorney.
*  He was a signer.
*  He could post sign on mom's checks.
*  She redrafts her will so that if she dies before Denzel, he is the right to live on her
*  property.
*  Basically, he'd control almost everything.
*  And she also dissolves her financial trust.
*  This is the trust that her daughter Julie managed, which holds all of her assets and all
*  of her investments.
*  And when Julie checks Diane's bank statements, she starts seeing cash withdrawals of hundreds
*  of dollars at a time.
*  This was especially worrying because they knew that their mother was worth around $4 million.
*  And that Denzel, you know, three times divorced, a retired horse you were, was worth basically
*  nothing.
*  Denzel had taken mom's phones away.
*  We couldn't talk to her on the phone.
*  We didn't know if she was dead or alive.
*  He wouldn't respond to us anymore.
*  We were scared.
*  All of this just leads Chris and Julie to the conclusion that they need to get to the
*  bottom of what's been happening.
*  I was just sitting in the chair in my living room and it's like something swept over
*  me and said, you need to go to Iowa right now.
*  So what do they decide to do?
*  Their first step is to call a lawyer.
*  And the lawyer recommended that they obtain what's called a temporary protective order.
*  Basically an emergency restraining order that would force Denzel to move out of the house
*  and stay away from Diane.
*  And the sisters hoped really give them a chance to sit down with their mother away from
*  Denzel's influence and really get to the bottom of what was happening.
*  And that's what the restraining order would in theory do, right?
*  It wouldn't get Denzel arrested, but it would get him out of the house.
*  That's right.
*  So as the lawyers are sort of working away on this paperwork, Chris and Julie get an
*  off-late home to Iowa.
*  It was I think on a Thursday that we flew into Omaha.
*  It's October 2017.
*  They drive up to the old farmhouse.
*  Our level of fear driving up that driveway was unreal because we didn't know how Denzel
*  was going to react.
*  We didn't know how soon the police were going to be there.
*  Walking up to that door was the most frightening moment of my life.
*  They knock on the side door.
*  They describe your mother answering and her initial response to them being there is to
*  hesitate.
*  She just stood there and I said, Mom, can we come in?
*  And she goes, oh, yeah, you know, like she was startled.
*  Like, of course, she can come in.
*  When the daughters walk into the house, they are shocked by what they see.
*  This farmhouse, which was once scrupulously tidy, now just looks unkempt.
*  In the kitchen, the landline phone is missing and the shelves are basically bare.
*  The only food that Diane seems to have in the house is a freezer full of ice cream cones.
*  On the stove, there's this piece of masking tape with Denzel's handwriting on it.
*  It says, do not use in big letters.
*  On the door frame, there's this piece of wood that's just blocking access to the staircase.
*  When we go in, we find our mom in Cape Bull of doing anything or understanding why we're
*  there or anything.
*  And their mother just seems completely out of it.
*  Her curly white hair, which is usually perfectly styled and puffed, is flat around her neck
*  as if it hasn't been washed.
*  Her watches on upside down.
*  Her words come out slurred.
*  Eventually Diane kind of gives up and goes into the bedroom and just lies face down on
*  her bed.
*  Chris and I just tried to make conversation hoping and praying that the police would come
*  driving up the driveway.
*  As expected, for the daughters, two sheriff's deputies pull up.
*  And I looked at Chris like, oh, you know, because I didn't know how he was going to react.
*  I was terror.
*  The deputies explained that under the terms of the order, Denzel would be immediately
*  removed from Diane's home and quote, restrained from committing further acts of abuse or threats
*  about her abuse, charges that Denzel immediately denied.
*  Chris went straight back to the bedroom so that she could be with mom because I said, I
*  don't want mom to be upset or to wake up to any of what's going on.
*  So in this sister's telling Denzel runs into Diane's bedroom where she's sleeping.
*  She buys and he's screaming at my mom.
*  Diane, Diane, do you know what those girls have done?
*  Do you know what they're doing to me?
*  I'm screaming at the top of his lungs.
*  It was utter chaos.
*  And then his sort of forced to leave the home.
*  The look on his face when he walked out that door was, I wish you were dead.
*  He was furious.
*  I don't think Kristen Julie really had plans for what would come next.
*  And I think what surprised the most on that initial day was that none of this seemed to
*  register for Diane at all.
*  You know, when the police left, she fell asleep.
*  The first thing she said when she woke up from her nap, despite having witnessed, you
*  know, this whole scene before her was, where's Denzel?
*  And she asked it again and she asked it again and all evening and in the middle of the
*  night and the next day too.
*  She didn't even know where he had gone.
*  And I think the daughters, you know, they tried to explain to their mother what was happening.
*  Can I ask a question?
*  Yeah, but you don't know.
*  So let me get an answer.
*  Oh, what?
*  Well, later I listened to this long conversation that Chris recorded on her phone.
*  Did you terminate my general power of attorney?
*  And you can hear Kristen Julie, you know, ask questions of their mother.
*  What do you mean general power of attorney?
*  Just I had a, I know you terminated my trust, but did you also terminate my power of attorney?
*  What is the problem with that tonight?
*  I just went, okay.
*  Hi.
*  And and Diane's responses are really shocking.
*  She says, you know, what's the power of attorney?
*  And there are changes.
*  She doesn't remember making.
*  You know, I could grasp nothing about the trust.
*  Oh, no, I always said, was there and you don't hold it out.
*  And that's I've never, I never told anything from your 12.
*  She's using that.
*  Well, Diane clearly doesn't understand, you know, the precise financial and legal decisions
*  that she made.
*  Her motivation is very clear.
*  A long time ago, when after dad died, we did this.
*  You asked me.
*  You said, mom, you know, I, when you want to take care of their trust.
*  And I looked at you and I said, honey, I don't know if I know the first thing about that
*  sort of thing.
*  I do want to do it.
*  You said, you'd be happy to.
*  And I said, okay, I have.
*  So I can remember saying that, but no, I've got the feeling that it has nothing to do
*  with them.
*  So he's got his own money.
*  I got my own money.
*  I want to be able to be my own person before I die.
*  She tells her daughters, I want to make my own decisions.
*  I want to be in charge of myself until I die.
*  I knew that I had given you control of it for me because back bit for war, because I didn't
*  have a clue and my mind wasn't working very well anyway.
*  Probably better than it is not.
*  But I want to be my own person.
*  I'm realizing Katie in this moment that I don't really understand what the law has to
*  say about this complicated situation.
*  I mean, here Diane is asking to see Denzel who has just been removed from the house
*  per that protective order.
*  And Diane is taking actions like giving him power of attorney, but she's been given
*  a diagnosis of dementia and that recording you heard suggests she didn't even understand
*  what power of attorney is at this moment.
*  What sort of which runs contrary to the idea that she's really capable of being in control
*  of her life and these kinds of decisions?
*  So what does the law say about that?
*  Yeah, this definitely confused Diane's daughter and it confuses a lot of adult children of
*  people with dementia.
*  Adult children often assume that the moment a doctor pronounces a person to have dementia,
*  it kind of flips a decisional switch and all of a sudden that person is now legally and
*  medically incapable of choosing for herself anymore.
*  The reality is that there's no such switch within modern medicine.
*  Patients are never declared completely competent or incompetent in some holistic sense.
*  Instead, doctors are asked to look at individual choices and whether or not a person is able
*  to make a specific choice in a specific moment.
*  In practice, can mean that a person with dementia can retain the ability to make choices for
*  many years and then lose the ability in stages.
*  So lose the ability to make complex choices first and then simple ones later.
*  And this is important from a legal perspective too because it means that people with dementia
*  retain the ability to make legal choices even when they are cognitively impaired.
*  But of course, this often creates conflicts within families because there's no clear cut,
*  medical way to determine without error that a person is capable of making a specific choice.
*  So based on what you just said, the daughter's options would seem to be pretty limited here.
*  So what is their next move?
*  It's clear to Chris and Julie that their mother had been very effective at hiding the extent
*  of her impairment from them.
*  At this point, Diana is still speaking well and she can be engaged in conversation.
*  So her daughter's decided that it's probably going to be important for them to get some
*  evidence that their mother is actually very sick.
*  And their decision is to bring her to the University of Iowa, hospitals and clinic where
*  they know there's a dedicated geriatric psychiatry unit where their mother can get a more formal
*  assessment.
*  And so we sat mom down and explained it to her as best we could without having it sound
*  scary.
*  Like we're taking you to a hospital and they're telling Diana Grace to go.
*  She helps to pack her bag.
*  She gets into the car and they all start in on this hour's long drive to the hospital.
*  Everything stayed quiet in the car for quite a while.
*  We got to Des Moines and my phone rang and it was our attorney's mother who's a nurse.
*  It's sometime around sunset.
*  And mom said, who is that?
*  I said, Eileen.
*  Well, could I talk to her?
*  Of course.
*  That Diane starts getting upset.
*  So she gets the phone.
*  Eileen, I'm being kidnapped.
*  Please call the police.
*  Come and get me.
*  I'm being kidnapped.
*  And Eileen.
*  At some point she throws a book at Julie.
*  She starts hitting Chris.
*  I had to grab her wrist to keep her from continuing to hit me.
*  She's screaming that she doesn't know where she is and is being driven somewhere against
*  her will.
*  Yes, it was terrifying.
*  Physically.
*  It's the voice.
*  It's the body.
*  It's everything that nurtured you before.
*  And suddenly it's like she's possessed.
*  After a few minutes of this, the sisters decide they're going to call an ambulance and
*  have an ambulance drive Diane the rest of the way to the hospital.
*  When they get there, Diane's given a cognitive assessment.
*  And what's shocking is that while Diane has been operating more or less normally in her
*  life, she actually has very significant deficits.
*  The neuropsychologist who tests her describes deficits in almost every field that he tests
*  for and decides that Diane is unable to safely perform tasks as complex as preparing a
*  meal.
*  In his final report, he describes Diane as having significantly limited capacity for informed
*  personal medical and financial decision making.
*  Later, a doctor helps to kind of interpret these findings and she uses the phrase Alzheimer's
*  disease for the first time.
*  In her view, Diane is already at a late moderate stage.
*  So far beyond the kind of mild forgetfulness that had started to worry her daughters.
*  So the kids wanted to know how bad things had gotten for their mom and now they know.
*  I mean, they have a very serious diagnosis now.
*  Right.
*  And that really convinces them that they need to take control of the situation in a more
*  formal way.
*  So talking to their lawyer, Kristen Julie decided that they're going to focus on getting
*  legal guardianship of their mother, which will effectively give them control over many
*  of her personal and medical choices.
*  And they're convinced that, you know, this will be a fairly straightforward case and that
*  once they get guardianship, they'll be able to kind of fix everything.
*  But it's also at this point that their personal relationship with their mother really evaporates.
*  Diane has moved from the hospital to an assisted living facility in Denison.
*  And because the elder abuse charges against Denzel, have been dropped, she's able to start
*  seeing him again.
*  And once that happens, Diane quickly makes the choice to stop seeing her children.
*  She tells pretty much everyone she knows, everyone she sees that she wants nothing to do
*  with them, that she doesn't want them to visit.
*  At one point, she even tells a friend she doesn't have daughters anymore.
*  Hello.
*  Hi, Denzel.
*  Hi.
*  There's this recording of a phone call.
*  I'm not sure where to start.
*  So I'll tell you what I planned on saying and that is that I would be happy to sit down
*  and talk with you and Nana.
*  Well, I don't know.
*  I'll have to get back to you.
*  Please let me tell my grandmother the same thing.
*  I'll let you tell her.
*  Julie's daughter, Haley calls her grandmother, Diane, and tries to mediate the situation.
*  You know, Hi, Nana.
*  Hi.
*  Over the course of the call, you really hear Haley try to make the case that I love all
*  of my family.
*  I love you both.
*  I love my mother and aunt.
*  You know, this has just got out of control.
*  Christine Julie, love their mother.
*  I need you both to know and I need especially, Denzel to know that from my perspective, there
*  are opportunities for everybody to come together and everybody to be happiest, especially Nana.
*  There's got to be some way to resolve this.
*  It's up to Nana, whether she accepts them again, not Dan and Nana.
*  She has chosen to write them all down.
*  I need to listen to her.
*  And Diane, for her part, she speaks very lucidly.
*  I know I think there's an easy way out of this.
*  There is no un-can't handle much more stress.
*  And the only way I can get rid of that stress is to create a positive stress, which has
*  to keep your family.
*  I'm sorry.
*  She says quite clearly, there's not a way to move on.
*  I think over what else to do to save my life.
*  If there's only thing I can do, then I have to accept them as long as possible.
*  I'm going to be fine.
*  I want you to know what else to do.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Hello.
*  Hi, Mr. Nelson.
*  Thanks so much for getting back to me again.
*  Can you hear me okay?
*  Yes.
*  Okay, great.
*  And thanks for this.
*  Okay, you eventually spoke with Denzel about how he saw his relationship with Diane and with her family.
*  So in his mind, how did all of this play out?
*  So Denzel also describes falling in love as sort of set in and unexpected.
*  One day I decided I was just going to go for a ride.
*  And Diane was out working at the yard and she says, well, what are you up to today?
*  And I said, you know, it's a nice day.
*  I'm going to get in the truck and just go for a ride.
*  I first got in touch with him on the phone. He told me this.
*  Long story about falling in love with Diane and his truck.
*  I said, you want to come along?
*  Did she say, well, where are you going?
*  I said, I don't know.
*  She said, well, yeah.
*  And that day they took their first drive.
*  Soon one drive became regular drives and the longer drives.
*  They took trips to horse shows and quilt shows and antique sales all around the state.
*  One of the first trips we made,
*  and I always think of me because her husband was an attorney.
*  And every trip they ever went on, they had to be certain sets of plays because they had a motel.
*  You know, these trips were themselves kind of an entirely new experience for Diane.
*  And the first trip we went on, when we just took off,
*  she said, where are we staying tonight?
*  And I said, well, or anyone else to me.
*  Diane, he said it was amazed to learn that Dental never booked a motel room in advance.
*  He just got in his car and drove and drove until he felt like stopping and then he'd stay at whatever motel happened to have space.
*  So she liked how it was kind of more spontaneous traveling with you?
*  The saddest deal was something that just really tickled her.
*  And Dental says that on those longer trips, they would sometimes stay overnight at a motel.
*  In the beginning, of course, they're just friends.
*  So they would sleep in two separate beds.
*  He talked about leaving the room to go outside while she got dressed and he'd do the same for her.
*  But then one night, as he told it, Diane just climbed out of her bed and into his arms
*  and he thought at that moment about how she was the gentlest person he'd ever met.
*  Fighting one day?
*  Well, anyway, we ended up in a big house and I was invited.
*  And so this relationship just blossoms?
*  We had some really, a couple of three really good years there from the 2013 until this ultimately began.
*  When Dental moved in, you know, he even knew that Diane's daughter
*  was weren't really accepting of the relationship.
*  Chris never did like the idea that I was living in her dad's house.
*  But he also didn't really care.
*  You know, it wasn't her dad's house anymore. He was her mother's house.
*  I think Dental felt like, you know, Diane was a grown woman and she was entitled to make her own decisions
*  and it didn't really bother him, mother.
*  A couple of daughters who lived out of state approved of him or not.
*  But later, I think Dental started to butt heads more with Chris and Julie.
*  It seemed to him that Diane's daughters were interested in controlling things for their mother.
*  You know, he was surprised to learn that even Diane's social security check went straight into an account
*  that was managed by Julie.
*  And he described being sort of disturbed to learn that whenever Diane wanted to do anything major,
*  like create in her car for when she liked better, she had to go through Julie,
*  who was the trustee of her trust.
*  Did it bother her that Julie was kind of in charge of things?
*  Or did she like it because it was easier?
*  No, she hated it.
*  Yeah.
*  She was perfectly able to take care of her own bills and everything.
*  Hmm.
*  I'm curious what Dental's interpretation and recollection is of the day that Diane's daughters show up with that order,
*  forcing him to leave the house.
*  I think he was completely amazed by it.
*  I was home and I saw Chris and Julie come up to the door and I told Diane I said,
*  there's going to be trouble.
*  He didn't see it coming at all.
*  And then the sheriff showed up and they had a restraining order and they hauled me out of the house.
*  And then I heard Chris tell Diane Dental did something illegal and you're never going to see it again.
*  In Dental's version of events, he doesn't resist at all.
*  He goes into Diane's bedroom to say goodbye to her.
*  I told Diane I said, be tough honey.
*  There ustedes legacy got there his various medications and gets into his car and drives away.
*  I think that's always completely taken.
*  Your back when you heard the specific charges.
*  That he was accused of.
*  A charge to somebody else.
*  I just want to lie right after them.
*  Certainly the phrase A elder abuse struck him as being entirely inappropriate.
*  that copy of his diary from that time
*  and he called them the sin sisters
*  kind of coming in and making up stories
*  about him hurting this person
*  who he loved more than anyone else.
*  They said, I wasn't seeing the writer,
*  we weren't eating right.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what the lies they told, you know.
*  And he had his own explanation for things.
*  Most of the time we went out to eat
*  because we cooked and Diana took to her lies.
*  As for the cupboards being bare,
*  well, Denzel said the cupboards were bare
*  because he knew that Diana had spent
*  50 years of her life cooking for other people
*  and he thought it would be nice for her
*  to be taken care of.
*  They said there was some mold in there
*  and there was no mold.
*  As for the house being dirty again, he said,
*  it looked okay to him.
*  But anyway, he didn't like to see Diana
*  on her hands and knees scrubbing the floor
*  and anytime he did, he told her to get up
*  and not worry about it.
*  He would take care of things.
*  So Denzel, you know, he left the house
*  as he was forced to do.
*  But I think from that moment,
*  he had every intention to fight Diana's daughters
*  for what he saw as Diana's freedom and liberation.
*  What about the decline of her memory?
*  Which of course is at the heart of all the legal maneuvers
*  that his daughters are undertaking.
*  What does he say about that?
*  He really denies that at this time, Diane was sick.
*  No, he was not having any memory issues.
*  So the student, in your opinion,
*  she didn't really have dementia
*  right when this all started.
*  She got it later.
*  No, no.
*  Sure, he noticed Diane was a little less steady
*  on her feet and maybe her memory wasn't what it was
*  at the age of 30 or 40,
*  but he didn't see it as being some big serious thing.
*  A lot of people have a bit of dementia.
*  And I think his view was that Diane was more or less unchanged
*  and certainly not changed to the point
*  where she needed someone to be caring for her all at the time.
*  He was prepared to care for her in whatever way.
*  He said she needed.
*  So what does Denzel do after he and Diane
*  are forcibly separated?
*  So the first thing he does is leave the house,
*  is he's ordered to do.
*  He moves in with his son.
*  I just, I thought it went nuts.
*  I mean,
*  can connect with her, can call her or not.
*  But once Diane's transferred to the assistive living facility,
*  he's given visitation rights again
*  and he starts visiting her every day.
*  Most morning, I'm an early riser.
*  I always have been.
*  I would give it four o'clock.
*  I don't hear what time it would have been.
*  And so I'd wait around until seven
*  when I could go out there and go to breakfast with her.
*  He shows up at seven a.m.
*  He stays 12 hours.
*  He goes for little walks with her around the building.
*  He calculates that if they walk around the building
*  10 times, it's a mile, not walk it twice.
*  He sits with her while she naps.
*  We played a lot of cards and watched TV
*  and sat out in the porch swing.
*  And he says that oftentimes in the night,
*  he would get a call from the assistive living facility
*  and nurse would tell him that Diane was crying.
*  2 a.m. 3 a.m. that she was crying
*  and she wouldn't stop and they'd ask if he could come.
*  But many nights he'd call me that Diane was
*  failing a bad time.
*  What was she, was it just because she was sick
*  or she was lonely, do you think?
*  She just with what her daughters did to her.
*  And then maybe they tried to call that day or something
*  and she wouldn't talk to them
*  and then she'd be thinking about it.
*  Yeah, how would you settle her down?
*  Pugger, yes sir.
*  Tell her everything was gonna be all right.
*  And as Denzel tells it, you know, Diana's very clear
*  throughout this whole time that she loves him,
*  that she wants to be with him
*  and that more than that, she doesn't want to see her daughters
*  anymore.
*  And Denzel sees it for himself, he says, you know,
*  when Kristen Julie call, Diane's asked if she wants
*  to take the call, she always says no.
*  It's Christmas approaches, Diane,
*  sends word to her daughters through her lawyers
*  that she doesn't wanna see them at all.
*  And I think Denzel really feels heading into the guardianship
*  case that he's a really good chance of winning
*  because isn't it obvious?
*  Diane is telling everyone that she wants Denzel
*  and shouldn't be her choice.
*  Well, eventually a court had to make that decision.
*  Tell us what happened during this trial
*  over guardianship for Diane.
*  Well, in a way, this kind of routine trial
*  in this small town in Iowa became this larger philosophical
*  debate over which version of Diane should be listened to.
*  No, Kristen Julie made the point that their mother had
*  for years told them if she ever got dementia,
*  they should be the ones to take care of her.
*  She trusted them to make the right decision for her.
*  Denzel, on the other hand, argued that none of that really
*  mattered because the version of Diane
*  who was sitting in front of them all was saying something
*  very different.
*  She was saying she wanted him.
*  So in the end, it was a question of what does Diane really want?
*  Is it what she's saying she wants there in the moment
*  in court or is it what she said consistently
*  for all the years before her mind became impaired?
*  And ultimately, what does the judge decide?
*  In the end, neither of those two sides wins.
*  The judge decides that Kristen Julie won't be suitable guardians
*  in part because they live out of state,
*  but also because they don't seem to be taking their mother's
*  wishes into consideration when making decisions for her.
*  On the other hand, the judge thinks Denzel will be unsuitable
*  because he really seems to underappreciate how sick Diane is.
*  He says over and over in court that she's not sick at all
*  as far as he knows.
*  So the judge takes this middle course
*  in a points one of Diane's friends,
*  Marshall Lash is the guardian.
*  And what do both sides end up making of that middle course
*  starting with Denzel?
*  I think he still feels liberated by the decision.
*  That's who Diane won it.
*  When they asked Diane who she liked to be a guardian,
*  she said, Marshall, and of course.
*  He's friendly with the woman who's appointed guardian
*  and with her permission, he gains the right to see Diane
*  whenever he wants also to move back into her house.
*  I was there three times a day to see her
*  when she was there, when I could.
*  Three times a day.
*  And so he kind of continues doing what he'd been doing before
*  visiting her every day, spending the day.
*  But I mean, I knew she was getting worse
*  that dementia only went one way.
*  Yeah, you know, I get delighted when I get there.
*  He does start to notice at this time
*  that Diane isn't what she used to be.
*  Well, I help her put her makeup on.
*  And I think that was my first thing I noticed.
*  It sort of starts with her makeup.
*  I mean, she was a very attractive lady.
*  She was a lady and it bothered her
*  that she couldn't turn her hands, you know,
*  or shake them and that.
*  And so I actually helped her put her makeup on.
*  Not if I didn't do a real good job,
*  but I helped her put her makeup on every morning.
*  And as Diane's dementia got worse,
*  she's moved to a different facility
*  and nursing home with a specialized memory care unit.
*  But Denzel keeps visiting her there
*  and his visits continue until 2020, the pandemic.
*  The COVID.
*  Yeah.
*  When the COVID started then, you know,
*  I couldn't get her out of there anymore.
*  Diane, some days seemed to understand what was going on,
*  but other times seemed to know nothing of the pandemic.
*  And it got to where it was hurtful.
*  She would see her time.
*  She said, I know you can get in here.
*  You just don't want to, you know, and that really hurt.
*  Because she understood COVID at first.
*  But then it got to her seat and understand the COVID.
*  Yeah.
*  And then she said,
*  I got the receipt and understand the COVID.
*  Yeah.
*  She accused Denzel of choosing not to visit her,
*  of being allowed to come inside, but not wanting to.
*  We just had a really good few years here.
*  But that all ended.
*  That dementia is, to me, is worse than cancer.
*  And then eventually it became less clear to Denzel
*  that Diane always knew who he was.
*  And it was around that time he says
*  that he stopped visiting.
*  And it's an untidy goodbye.
*  And it's incomplete.
*  Just one day, I visit as hard.
*  And then that's the last that Denzel
*  ever sees Diane again.
*  So let's return to Chris and to Julie.
*  What do they do after they find out
*  about the judges' decision in the Guardian case?
*  So Chris and Julie go back to their respective homes.
*  And immediately they start working on an appeal.
*  But they also continued this relentless sort of effort
*  to get in touch with their mother.
*  But their calls wouldn't be put through.
*  They'd get friends to call to sometimes
*  and just try desperately to get word of Diane.
*  And none of that worked until.
*  This is Erin.
*  Can I help you?
*  Hi, Erin.
*  Could I speak to Diane Noreal?
*  Yes, please?
*  Yes, just a minute.
*  OK.
*  One day, Julie's friend Mary calls the nursing home
*  and to everyone's surprise, she's put through to Diane.
*  Hello.
*  Hello, Diane.
*  This is Mary.
*  I called you last week.
*  Yes.
*  How are you doing today?
*  You're getting better.
*  Mary and Diane were able to talk a couple of times.
*  And it was clear that Diane's cognition was very diminished
*  at this point.
*  She seemed confused, a lot of what she said,
*  didn't make a lot of sense.
*  But what was clear was that she was unhappy
*  where she was living in this basement unit
*  of the local nursing home.
*  So I called your daughter, Julie, and she's
*  finding you a different place to live.
*  All right?
*  Yes.
*  Oh, my goodness.
*  I was able to listen to one of the calls.
*  And on it, Mary tells Diane that she's
*  been in touch with Kristen Julie
*  and that they're going to try to get her move
*  to a different, better facility.
*  Yes.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  Just fit.
*  Well, don't cry.
*  Don't cry.
*  Diane just breaks down in tears.
*  And she says it would be so wonderful.
*  And she's so happy to hear that her daughters are maybe
*  going to help her.
*  They're going to come and see you as soon as they can,
*  you know?
*  Is that OK?
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  Absolutely.
*  They haven't come into you.
*  But at the end of the call, OK, Diane, I'm going to let you
*  go.
*  I'm going to call Julie right now.
*  OK.
*  And then I'll call you back.
*  Thank you, sweetheart.
*  You're welcome.
*  You're the sweet heart.
*  Diane forgets to hang up.
*  And Mary just sort of stays on the line for a few minutes.
*  And you can hear Diane crying softly in the background
*  and then sitting in silence for a while.
*  And then you can hear a nurse come in.
*  And she asked Diane if she's OK.
*  And take me.
*  Take me.
*  She tells the nurse they hate me.
*  They call me so fast.
*  They call me bad things.
*  I'm sorry.
*  So in September 2020, a court finally
*  agrees to Kristen Julie's request
*  that Diane be moved to a more specialized facility in Omaha.
*  Almost immediately after arriving,
*  she has put on hospice care.
*  Doctors decide that she is dying
*  and doesn't have very long to live.
*  And it was then that a judge finally
*  signs his order granting Kristen Julie the right
*  to see their mother for the first time in over two years
*  because of the state Diane's in.
*  Chris' immune compromise and decided
*  that it wasn't safe for her to travel during the pandemic.
*  But Julie gets in her truck and she drives nine hours
*  to Nebraska.
*  Walking through her threshold,
*  I mean, the anxiety, the fear of, you know,
*  I haven't seen mom print what Chris three years.
*  I haven't seen my mother.
*  And she ends up spending four.
*  As she describes them completely pleasant
*  and wonderful days with Diane.
*  I went in and mom was in bed.
*  She was very weak.
*  But I sat beside her.
*  She sat up.
*  But I sat beside her.
*  She sat up.
*  We talked.
*  We hugged.
*  We kissed.
*  We giggled and she was so happy.
*  And then we, she laid down and I tucked her in
*  under her little blankie and she said,
*  oh, stay here by me.
*  Stay here.
*  So she held my hand and I just laid down beside her.
*  And sometimes Julie says, Diane seems to maybe ask
*  about Denzel.
*  She asks, where is that man?
*  Where is that man?
*  A few times.
*  But she never calls him by name.
*  I can't tell you how hard it was to have to leave that last day.
*  When I left, the feeling I had was that this is how it
*  should have been from the beginning.
*  In January of 2021, Chris and Julie are granted guardianship
*  of Diane.
*  And they call each other.
*  They can't believe this has finally happened.
*  They start planning a trip together to see their mother.
*  But four days later, before they could take that trip, Diane
*  dies at the nursing home.
*  I'm sure that's why I'm here.
*  I'm sure that's why I'm here.
*  Katie, it occurs to me that in the story that you have just
*  told everybody involved was hurt in some way and hurt deeply.
*  The daughter's Denzel, Diane.
*  So how do you think about why there was so much pain
*  in this story?
*  Is this really about bad decisions made by the people
*  that we have been talking about, or is this about a bad system
*  that we have for handling people with dementia?
*  Or is it both?
*  I think as a journalist, I often write stories where there
*  are, in the end, good guys and bad guys.
*  And that's not how I felt in this case.
*  I really felt that everyone involved in this story
*  was arguing and fighting in good faith.
*  Everyone loved Diane.
*  I think in part, there are weaknesses in the system.
*  If you look at someone who has dementia,
*  that person might live with the diagnosis for years,
*  slowly deteriorating.
*  And there's no clear and obvious and easy
*  to measure point at which a person with dementia
*  loses the ability to do something for herself
*  and then loses the legal right to do it.
*  I think that's just an inherent difficulty with the disease.
*  The medical system can try, and the court system
*  can try to locate that point, but it's not going to be easy.
*  And certainly a person with dementia, a person like Diane,
*  can remember things and forget things
*  and remember again in the course of a day.
*  So what do you do with that?
*  But I think beyond that, in many ways,
*  Densel and Diane's daughters were just living
*  with different versions of the same woman.
*  And I think given how they knew Diane, this is understandable,
*  the daughters were committed to the then version
*  of their mother, the pre-demandsia version of their mother,
*  the one they'd lived with for decades,
*  the one who had been clear about what she wanted
*  at the end of her life.
*  And they felt obliged to, even when that woman seemed
*  to disappear, to recall her and to honor her, what she wanted.
*  And Densel, on the other hand, only had the woman
*  who was sitting in front of him at the moment.
*  And he felt that he loved her and that the right thing
*  to do was to listen to her, to listen to what she was saying
*  and to take it at face value, not as some pathological symptom
*  of a cognitive impairment.
*  And so he was in a way advocating for the Diane
*  who was diminished.
*  And I think even amongst academics who debate this,
*  this is a contested subject.
*  Who's the authentic person?
*  Who in this case was the real Diane?
*  I mean, have you come to a conclusion of your own
*  after spending all this time with the family, with Densel
*  and with the documents, which one was the real Diane,
*  the one the kids remembered and wanted to honor
*  or the one who fell in love with Densel?
*  I think it's hard to say who the real Diane was,
*  but I do know that as a society,
*  with our medical system and our legal system,
*  as they are, we're moving in the direction
*  of honoring Densel's version of Diane.
*  It used to be, you know, in the early 20th century
*  that just having a diagnosis of dementia
*  basically meant that you were stripped of all your decision
*  making power, stripped of all your civil liberties
*  and put under the control of other people.
*  And we've moved away from that system
*  and we've moved towards a world in which we hope,
*  even people with significant disabilities
*  and impairments can live with some autonomy.
*  And in the case of dementia,
*  that means increasingly listening to what a person
*  with dementia says she wants,
*  even if it's different from what she said she wanted
*  for decades and decades of her life.
*  And I think that is understandable from a political
*  or legal standpoint, but very, very challenging
*  for the adult children of people with this disease.
*  Right.
*  Because they have to live with the reality
*  that the now version of their mother
*  or their father or their sister or their brother
*  is the one that the system privileges and prioritizes.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think it can be terrifying for the rest of us too.
*  We can tell our children what we want to happen to us
*  when we're older and the event that we get sick,
*  we can write up documents, outlining our wishes,
*  but in the end, they might just not be listened to
*  because in the throws of the disease,
*  we might change our minds.
*  And that can be very scary.
*  I feel like I know who I am.
*  And it's frightening.
*  The thought that some different impaired version of me
*  might actually have both the ethical and the legal
*  authority to usurp what I decide I want.
*  Okay, Dee.
*  Thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  US officials and outside experts tell the times
*  that North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un
*  has shifted to a policy of open hostility towards South Korea
*  and could take some sort of lethal military action
*  against the country in the coming months.
*  They said that Kim has been emboldened by a growing
*  partnership with Russia and by his conclusion
*  that the United States military is in global retreat
*  since withdrawing from Afghanistan in 2022.
