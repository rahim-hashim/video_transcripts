*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro. This is The Daily.
*  On behalf of the House Republican Conference, I rise today to nominate the gentlemen from
*  Louisiana, Mike Johnson, as Speaker of the People's House.
*  After 21 days without a leader and after cycling through four different nominees, House
*  Republicans have finally elected a Speaker to lead the chamber.
*  Therefore, the honorable Mike Johnson, the state of Louisiana, having received a majority
*  of the votes cast as duly elected Speaker of the House of Representatives for the 118th Congress.
*  My colleague, Congressional reporter Luke Broadwater, was inside the Capitol as it happened.
*  The committee will retire from the chamber to escort the Speaker-elect to the chair.
*  It's Thursday, October 26.
*  Luke, it's 2.32 pm and you just raced into a phone booth inside the Capitol to talk to
*  us, which is very nice of you, because it entailed tearing yourself away from a historic
*  scene that was unfolding.
*  And I want you to describe that scene.
*  Yes, I was in the Speaker's lobby watching Republicans elect a new Speaker of the House,
*  Mike Johnson of Louisiana.
*  He had just won.
*  They were lining up all the dignitaries in leadership to honor this new Speaker.
*  And there was a bit of a debate going on about who would present him the gavel, would it
*  be the former Speaker, the temporary Speaker, or the leader of the House Democrats?
*  And this was a monumental occasion, because for more than three weeks now, the House has
*  been paralyzed.
*  No legislation has been able to move.
*  No aid for any of our allies overseas has been able to be approved and a government shutdown
*  is looming.
*  And Republicans had been fighting amongst themselves bitterly through candidate after candidate
*  unsuccessfully until they landed on Mike Johnson, who received a unanimous vote of his fellow
*  House Republicans, and now has the mandate to get the Congress back to work.
*  Right.
*  I think the key word there is unanimous, which seems pretty improbable given the battle
*  we've just been through.
*  And I want to kind of set the stage for this conversation, because the last time we covered
*  this seemingly endless soap opera, representative Jim Jordan was the nominee.
*  And it looked like Jordan was going to be the next Speaker, despite his reputation for
*  being very far to the right, an obstructionist in the words of a former Speaker John Banner,
*  a legislative terrorist.
*  So pick up the story from there and help us understand how we get to this moment.
*  Right.
*  And then, Jordan was in the fight of his life to try to become the next House Speaker.
*  And he had unleashed a pressure campaign against the whole House from the more mainstream
*  wing of the party that were refusing to vote for him.
*  On Capitol Hill now, some Republicans who voted against GOP Congressman Jim Jordan to be
*  the next Speaker of the House say they're getting death threats.
*  Threats and intimidation started to come in.
*  Reading I was Marianette Miller-Meks.
*  She said she's getting credible death threats and a barrage of threatening calls.
*  But will not.
*  People started getting the personal cell phone numbers of members of Congress and their
*  families.
*  Why is your husband such a pig?
*  Because he's a deep state prick.
*  Because he doesn't represent the people.
*  At one point, a Congressman said that his wife had begun to sleep with a gun at night,
*  because of the threats against the family.
*  And it was just getting uglier and uglier.
*  And it actually had the reverse effect.
*  Instead of the moderates buckling under the pressure campaign, they dug in deeper to find
*  the resolve and to fight back against these tactics.
*  Right.
*  The idea had been that Jordan was going to activate this far right network, the party's
*  base to hound these moderate lawmakers and make them feel like they didn't really have
*  a choice.
*  They had to vote for Jordan or perhaps they'd lose reelection, but it turned out they did
*  have a choice.
*  And that choice was to create this unmovable block of moderate Republicans who basically
*  said to Jim Jordan, your tactics are beyond the pale.
*  This is not acceptable.
*  You will not be our speaker.
*  And because Republicans have such a tight majority, it didn't take that many moderates
*  to block him.
*  Now I will say Jim Jordan says he had nothing to do with the pressure campaign that he
*  can't control outside groups that were lobbying for him.
*  But that said his supporters really offended many members of Congress.
*  And because of the slim margins in Congress, any Republican speaker candidate can only
*  afford to lose four fellow Republican votes, provided all the Democrats vote against the
*  Republican, which is the way the Chamber operates.
*  The next order of business is the election of speakers of the House of Representatives
*  for the 118th Congress.
*  Nominations are now in order.
*  And Jim Jordan ended up losing 25 fellow Republican votes.
*  I rise today to nominate the gentleman from Ohio, Jim Jordan, as Speaker of the
*  People's House.
*  And he lost them over a course of three different floor votes, and each time the opposition to
*  Jim Jordan grew.
*  The total number of votes cast is 432, of which the honorable Jim Jordan of the state of
*  Ohio has received 200 votes.
*  From the first vote, there were 20 Republicans opposed to him.
*  No person having received a majority, the whole number of votes cast by surname, a speaker
*  has not been elected.
*  By the second, as the calls kept coming in, of placing in nomination the name of the honorable
*  Jim Jordan, it rose to 22 against him.
*  A speaker has not been elected.
*  As more calls flooded in, I rise to nominate Jim Jordan for the speaker of the House.
*  The opposition rose to 25.
*  No person having received a majority, the whole number of votes cast by surname, a speaker
*  has not been elected.
*  Fellow Republicans standing firm in opposition to Jim Jordan.
*  One that chair declares the House and recess subject to the call of the chair.
*  Right, this was the revenge of the Republican moderates.
*  And it felt like a very distinct moment in time.
*  And the lesson seemed to be, give us, give the Republicans in the House a much more
*  mainstream candidate to be our speaker.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  You know, for years in Congress, the Republican party has had something of a civil war.
*  But it was almost always the case that the hard right faction led by the House Freedom
*  Caucus would use the tougher tactics.
*  And so they would get their way.
*  And it was kind of a running joke on the hill that the moderates always cave.
*  That's the reason they're moderates because they always want to compromise and make people
*  happy.
*  Right, there's even a nickname for these moderates.
*  Right, exactly.
*  Some of the hard right members call them the squishes.
*  And for the first time that anyone can remember, the moderates stood up for themselves and
*  they stood up in the face of this pressure campaign and they blocked Jim Jordan.
*  And that sent a message, I think a lot of us in the press corps believed that there
*  would be a demand for a more mainstream or moderate candidate.
*  And that led to the nomination of Tom Emmer of Minnesota on Tuesday afternoon, who is
*  the number three House Republican.
*  And perhaps the most moderate of all the potential candidates or leading candidates that have
*  had a real chance at becoming speaker this year.
*  And what makes him so moderate?
*  Well, he has taken a number of votes that I don't think that seemed that moderate to
*  much of the country, but they do to the hard right.
*  For instance, he voted to prevent discrimination against same sex couples.
*  And he refused to object to certifying President Biden's 2020 victory at a time when Donald
*  Trump was putting intense pressure on House Republicans to overturn the election and keep him as the
*  president.
*  So Emmer is kind of a moderate House Republicans dream candidate for the speakership, but of
*  course, we know that overall House Republicans are not so moderate.
*  So how does Emmer contend with that?
*  So Emmer is hopeful that he has the backing of the mainstream Republicans, but also has
*  one enough friends on the hard right to make sure that he can become speaker.
*  But what becomes quickly apparent is that although majority of House Republicans support
*  Tom Emmer, Donald Trump does not.
*  Donald Trump, the de facto leader of the Republican Party who has a lot of influence in the House
*  Republican Conference, just put out a blistering statement attacking Tom Emmer.
*  As what Trump said, voting for a globalist rhino like Tom Emmer would be a tragic mistake.
*  And allies of Donald Trump go out on the airwaves and on their podcasts.
*  I couldn't support Tom Emmer.
*  We need a speaker of the House that reflects the values and the views of Republican voters
*  across the country.
*  And they support President Trump and they support his agenda.
*  And Tom Emmer does not.
*  He starts ripping him apart.
*  He certified the fake election.
*  He has been the raw vote every single time.
*  He is Nancy Pelosi in a suit.
*  They say he's not loyal to Trump.
*  And everyone who watches the War of Impossi in the show needs to fight Tom Emmer every step
*  of the way.
*  Emmer starts defending himself.
*  He endorsed Donald Trump twice.
*  He has pictures of him with Donald Trump in his office.
*  He starts circulating those photos to media outlets to show how loyal he is to Donald
*  Trump.
*  But it's still not enough for the hard right.
*  So just four hours after he becomes the nominee, despite winning a majority of the votes,
*  there are still about two dozen hard right house Republicans standing in opposition to
*  him refusing to vote for Tom Emmer.
*  And Tom Emmer sees no other way out of this than to resign and renounce his candidacy
*  for speaker.
*  So it turns out there are enough moderates to kill a Jordan candidacy, but not enough moderates
*  to elect Tom Emmer.
*  That's exactly right.
*  And so Republicans are sent back to square one and they're kind of scraping the bottom
*  of the barrel now to figure out who could be the speaker.
*  And so after Tom Emmer is deposed, six more Republicans throw their names in as potential
*  candidates.
*  Because basically everyone thinks like why not me?
*  That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  And so I think that's the point, I think that's the point.
*  And so I think that's the point.
*  And so I think that's the point.
*  And so I think that's the point.
*  And so what happens to all these men looking in the mirror seeing a speaker?
*  Well, six of them vie for the next round of votes.
*  I guess this is the fifth time Republicans will try to nominate a speaker.
*  And one name starts to rise above all the others.
*  Democracy is messy sometimes, but it is our system.
*  And that is someone who's far to the right of Tom Emmer, who has no problem with objecting
*  to the 2020 election results.
*  This conference that you see, this House Republican majority, is united.
*  And that is Mike Johnson of Louisiana.
*  This is servant leadership.
*  We're going to serve the people of this country.
*  We're going to restore their faith in this Congress.
*  This is the two other.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Luke, tell us about this fourth nominee to be the Republican House speaker who I'm
*  going to be really honest, I had never heard of before now.
*  Right.
*  And there's a good reason you haven't heard of him.
*  He hasn't been in Congress that long.
*  He's not the chairman of any major committee.
*  He is, in fact, not the chairman of any committee.
*  And he's kind of, you know, a little known member of Congress.
*  But here's what we do know about Mike Johnson.
*  He is very conservative and he's also very religious.
*  Welcome back to Truth Be Told.
*  I'm Mike Johnson.
*  And I'm Kelly Johnson.
*  He hosts a podcast with his wife that's focused on Christianity.
*  Today we're going to provide an answer to the question that has been asked by countless
*  hundreds of millions of people and probably by all of us at one point or another.
*  How do I find God's will from my life?
*  He often talks about being an evangelical Christian.
*  And those Christian views, those conservative Christian views really do shape his politics.
*  Roby Wade gave constitutional cover to the elective killing of unborn children in America.
*  Period.
*  You think about the implications of this?
*  He's also very close with Jim Jordan.
*  The two of them have traveled Israel together to meet with Benjamin and Yahoo.
*  When when when you and Kelly went with Paulie and I to Israel a couple of years ago, what
*  a good time we had and a chance to learn about our great friend and ally, the state of Israel
*  and Jim Jordan serves as a mentor to him and sort of helped him run for Congress originally
*  and flew him out to meet with the House Freedom Caucus guys.
*  Just like Jim Jordan is very loyal to Donald Trump, so is Mike Johnson.
*  If Jim Jordan was the public face of fighting the 2020 election results in Congress, Mike
*  Johnson was his silent partner.
*  He was the constitutional lawyer behind the scenes coming up with various legal ways and
*  theories that Congress could try to overturn the results of the election.
*  The first thing he did was he tried to get members of Congress to sign on to an alterly
*  failed lawsuit to throw out Joe Biden's victory in four different states.
*  That lawsuit's rejected by the Supreme Court, but not before Mike Johnson gets 60% of House
*  Republic and is to sign on to it.
*  He does this by telling them he is spoken with President Trump and President Trump will
*  be looking at the list of names and taking account of who supported him and who didn't.
*  Interesting.
*  So Johnson seems even further to the right than Jim Jordan.
*  And thus I would imagine very unpalatable to those 20 or so moderates who had such problems
*  with Jordan.
*  Yeah, a lot of us in the press corps thought when we heard his name that moderates would
*  stand against him as they did against Jim Jordan, but this time that just didn't happen.
*  Well, why not?
*  Why would moderates not object him?
*  Well, I think there's a couple of reasons.
*  Some of the moderates we talked to in the hallways said essentially they were weighing the
*  continued dysfunction of the House and the need to get back to business against how right
*  wing Johnson is.
*  So was it worse for them to have Mike Johnson as speaker and potentially support a right
*  wing candidate when they're from a district that's more of a swing district or a purple
*  district or was it worse to continue the three rings circus taking place on Capitol Hill
*  head towards a government shutdown deny funding for our allies ever see.
*  So you can see how they looked at the situation and arrived at the result that it was better
*  for them to vote for somebody just so they could get back to business.
*  Right, you're saying these moderates start to worry less about picking the wrong speaker
*  and the political repercussions of that than they do about picking no speaker and being
*  associated with a deeply dysfunctional Congress because voters don't like that either.
*  That's exactly right.
*  And one thing that differentiates Johnson from Jordan is that he doesn't have the baggage
*  in some members views as Jordan did.
*  You've got to remember Jim Jordan came to Congress and was described by a previous Republican
*  speaker as a legislative terrorist.
*  And he had blown up a bunch of bills to fund the government and sort of the basic bills
*  of keeping the place open.
*  And so there were long memories about Jordan's misdeeds in their mind.
*  And Johnson just doesn't have the bad blood with his fellow Republicans that Jordan does.
*  And so that combined with the fact that there's a lot of fatigue on the Hill people are sick
*  of not having a speaker.
*  They're sick of going home on the weekend and having their constituents yell at them because
*  they're so dysfunctional.
*  And all of that built up to really a glide path from Mike Johnson, a guy who would have
*  had probably no chance of becoming a speaker a month ago to having the unanimous support
*  of his conference.
*  Right.
*  So I want to just review the journey that we have been on.
*  Kevin McCarthy is ousted as speaker by these far right members of the House just eight
*  of them.
*  The first nominee to replace him ends up being rejected as insufficiently conservative.
*  The second nominee is knocked out not because he's not conservative enough.
*  Jim Jordan was, but because he's just personally kind of hated the third nominee fails because
*  he's not conservative enough.
*  Tom Ember.
*  And ultimately the winner is a very, very conservative member, Mike Johnson.
*  So there's not a lot of mystery about ideologically speaking who won here.
*  House conservatives won.
*  So how should we think about why this was such an ugly 21 day war among people who largely
*  seem like they're on the same page?
*  In many ways, this is really the first sort of mega controlled house.
*  Before this, we had Democrats in charge of the House or we had Republican speakers who
*  were more in line with the older Republican party, right?
*  The more business-minded wing of the party who cared about small budgets and aggressive
*  military.
*  Now it's a much more populist party that's remade in Donald Trump's image.
*  It's people for the most part who don't like the status quo, who want to tear down the
*  establishment, who want to blow things up.
*  And so when you have a ton of people like that in the same room, it's essentially a
*  wrecking ball that's flying around all the time and it's unclear who's going to be
*  hit at any given time.
*  And so we saw over the course of this first year of this Congress, an unprecedented five
*  different speaker nominees.
*  And then what did they get out of the fifth nominee, the most conservative, the most hard
*  right, the guy who literally did Donald Trump's bidding in trying to overturn the election,
*  who actually served as one of his lawyers at one point in time and as an advisor.
*  And in fact, Matt Gates, who is the member of Congress, who got Kevin McCarthy kicked
*  out a speaker, goes on Steve Bannon's podcast, Steve Bannon, a Trump ally.
*  He is going to be a great moment for the House, and you know what, at the very end,
*  boasts that they have had an upgrade at speaker and the swamp is on the run.
*  The MAGA is ascendant.
*  And if you don't think that moving from Kevin McCarthy to MAGA Mike Johnson shows the
*  ascendance of this movement and where the power in the Republican Party truly lies, then
*  you're not paying attention.
*  But they are.
*  They've got a more MAGA member who is now leading the United States House of Representatives.
*  But look, this outcome, it feels like potentially a momentary pause in that ever swinging wrecking
*  ball within MAGA House Republican politics.
*  And that pause where everyone can get on the same page before they begin wrecking each
*  other again, it might be a few months, it might be a few days, it might be a few hours.
*  We don't really know.
*  And so how should we think about Mike Johnson's chances of being a successful speaker?
*  Because 21 days ago, the first chapter of this began, a speaker was ousted, that could
*  happen all over again, given everything you just said.
*  Right.
*  Well, Mike Johnson has been able to do something that no other speaker candidate could do.
*  He was able to unite House Republicans in a way, no one else has.
*  He looks like he has the command of the party.
*  But that said, this is particularly unruly Congress.
*  Mike Johnson will probably have a grace period for some period of time.
*  But eventually, he's going to have to make some decisions about keeping the government
*  open, about the debt.
*  It's hard not to see a scenario where some of the same complaints and concerns that the
*  hard right had with Kevin McCarthy might come back to Mike Johnson.
*  Keep in mind the same rule that hard right Republicans use to oust McCarthy is still
*  an effect in the Congress.
*  So at any point, a member can call, can force a vote to remove a speaker.
*  This Congress has been one that ends up eating its own.
*  And so the test from Mike Johnson will be how long can he hold off until they eat him
*  too?
*  Well, Luke, thank you very much.
*  I appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  And this group will deliver for the American people.
*  I said it in the chamber and I will say it here.
*  We're going to govern well.
*  On Wednesday afternoon, about an hour after his election, Speaker Johnson held a brief
*  news conference on the steps of the Capitol.
*  We're so grateful.
*  I'm so grateful and so humbled.
*  They've gotten a unanimous vote on the floor by all of my colleagues here.
*  Johnson said he would dispense with the usual ceremonies and celebrations of a new
*  speaker and immediately get to work.
*  We went through a lot to get here, but we are ready to govern and that will begin right
*  away.
*  You've all heard me talk a lot today and I'm not going to belabor the point because the
*  sun is bright and it's too warm in the fall.
*  But I'll see you there.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  At least seven people were killed and many more injured in a mass shooting in the town
*  of Lewiston, Maine, where a gunman reportedly opened fire at a restaurant and bowling alley.
*  As of Thursday morning, a massive manhunt was underway to capture the shooter who was
*  caught on camera using what appeared to be an assault rifle.
*  Lewiston, Maine's second biggest city, is about 40 miles north of Portland and home to
*  Bates College, where students were told to shelter in place.
*  And on Wednesday, with little warning, Hurricane Otis made landfall near the Mexican resort
*  town of Acapoco as a catastrophic category five hurricane, unlike most storms that intensify
*  slowly and are tracked closely by meteorologists.
*  Otis gained strength with stunning speed.
*  Its winds growing by 110 miles per hour in just 24 hours.
*  In interviews and social media posts, residents and tourists described widespread damage from
*  the storm.
*  Today's episode was produced by Michael Simon Johnson and Rochelle Bonja.
*  It was edited by Rachel Cuesta and Lexi Diel.
*  It was originally a music by Brad Fisher, Dan Powell and Mary and Luzano and was engineered
*  by Chris Wood.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Lanzberg of Wonderly.
*  That's it for the daily.
*  I'm Michael Bavore.
*  See you tomorrow.
