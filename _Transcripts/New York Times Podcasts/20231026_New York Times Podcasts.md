# The House Finally Has a Speaker
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZm8NNlz5GA)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today.
*  On behalf of the House Republican Conference, I rise today to nominate the gentleman from
*  Louisiana, Mike Johnson, as Speaker of the People's House.
*  After 21 days without a leader and after cycling through four different nominees, House Republicans
*  have finally elected a Speaker to lead the Chamber.
*  Therefore the Honorable Mike Johnson of the state of Louisiana, having received a majority
*  of the votes cast, is duly elected Speaker of the House of Representatives for the 118th
*  Congress.
*  My colleague, Congressional reporter Luke Broadwater, was inside the Capitol as it happened.
*  The Committee will retire from the Chamber to escort the Speaker-elect to the Chair.
*  It's Thursday, October 26th.
*  So, Luke, it's 2.32 p.m. and you just raced into a phone booth inside the Capitol to
*  talk to us, which is very nice of you, because it entailed tearing yourself away from a historic
*  scene that was unfolding.
*  And I want you to describe that scene.
*  Yes, I was in the Speaker's lobby watching Republicans elect a new Speaker of the House,
*  Mike Johnson of Louisiana.
*  He had just won.
*  They were lining up all the dignitaries in leadership to honor this new Speaker.
*  And there was a bit of a debate going on about who would present him the gavel.
*  Would it be the former Speaker, the temporary Speaker, or the leader of the House Democrats?
*  This was a monumental occasion because for more than three weeks now, the House has been
*  paralyzed.
*  No legislation has been able to move.
*  No aid for any of our allies overseas has been able to be approved.
*  And a government shutdown is looming.
*  And Republicans had been fighting amongst themselves bitterly through candidate after
*  candidate unsuccessfully until they landed on Mike Johnson, who received a unanimous
*  vote of his fellow House Republicans and now has the mandate to get the Congress back to
*  work.
*  Right.
*  I think the key word there is unanimous, which seems pretty improbable given the battle we've
*  just been through.
*  And I want to kind of set the stage for this conversation, because the last time we covered
*  this seemingly endless soap opera, Representative Jim Jordan was the nominee.
*  And it looked like Jordan was going to be the next Speaker, despite his reputation for
*  being very far to the right and obstructionist, in the words of a former Speaker, John Boehner,
*  a legislative terrorist.
*  So pick up the story from there and help us understand how we get to this moment.
*  Right.
*  Congressman Jim Jordan was in the fight of his life to try to become the next House Speaker.
*  And he had unleashed a pressure campaign against the holdouts from the more mainstream wing
*  of the party that were refusing to vote for him.
*  On Capitol Hill now, some Republicans who voted against GOP Congressman Jim Jordan to
*  be the next Speaker of the House say they're getting death threats.
*  Death threats and intimidation started to come in.
*  Including Iowa's Marionette Miller Meeks.
*  She said she's getting credible death threats and a barrage of threatening calls, but will
*  not...
*  People started getting the personal cell phone numbers of members of Congress and their families.
*  Why is your husband such a pig?
*  Because he's a deep state prick?
*  Because he doesn't represent the people?
*  At one point, a congressman said that his wife had begun to sleep with a gun at night
*  because of the threats against the family.
*  And it was just getting uglier and uglier.
*  And it actually had the reverse effect.
*  Instead of the moderates buckling under the pressure campaign, they dug in deeper to find
*  the resolve and to fight back against these tactics.
*  Right.
*  The idea had been that Jordan was going to activate this far right network, the party's
*  base to hound these moderate lawmakers and make them feel like they didn't really have
*  a choice.
*  They had to vote for Jordan or perhaps they'd lose reelection.
*  But it turned out they did have a choice.
*  And that choice was to create this unmovable block of moderate Republicans who basically
*  said to Jim Jordan, your tactics are beyond the pale.
*  This is not acceptable.
*  You will not be our speaker.
*  And because Republicans have such a tight majority, it didn't take that many moderates
*  to block him.
*  Now, I will say Jim Jordan says he had nothing to do with the pressure campaign, that he
*  can't control outside groups that were lobbying for him.
*  But that said, his supporters really offended many members of Congress.
*  And because of the slim margins in Congress, any Republican speaker candidate can only
*  afford to lose four fellow Republican votes, provided all the Democrats vote against the
*  Republican, which is the way the chamber operates.
*  The next order of business is the election of speakers of the House of Representatives
*  for the 118th Congress.
*  Nominations are now in order.
*  Jim Jordan ended up losing 25 fellow Republican votes.
*  I rise today to nominate the gentleman from Ohio, Jim Jordan, as speaker of the People's
*  House.
*  And he lost them over a course of three different floor votes, and each time the opposition
*  to Jim Jordan grill.
*  The total number of votes cast is 432, of which the Honorable Jim Jordan of the state
*  of Ohio has received 200 votes.
*  From the first vote, there were 20 Republicans opposed to him.
*  No person having received a majority of the whole number of votes cast by surname.
*  A speaker has not been elected.
*  By the second, as the calls kept coming in of placing in nomination the name of the Honorable
*  Jim Jordan, it rose to 22 against him.
*  A speaker has not been elected.
*  As more calls flooded in, I rise to nominate Jim Jordan for the Speaker of the House.
*  The opposition rose to 25.
*  No person having received a majority of the whole number of votes cast by surname.
*  A speaker has not been elected.
*  Fellow Republicans standing firm in opposition to Jim Jordan.
*  The chair declares the House in recess, subject to the call of the chair.
*  Right.
*  This was the revenge of the Republican moderates, and it felt like a very distinct moment in
*  time.
*  And the lesson seemed to be, give us, give the Republicans in the House a much more mainstream
*  candidate to be our speaker.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  For years in Congress, the Republican Party has had something of a civil war, but it was
*  almost always the case that the hard right faction led by the House Freedom Caucus would
*  use the tougher tactics, and so they would get their way.
*  And it was kind of a running joke on the Hill that the moderates always cave.
*  That's the reason they're moderates, because they always want to compromise and make people
*  happy.
*  Right.
*  There's even a nickname for these moderates.
*  Right, exactly.
*  Some of the hard right members call them the squishes.
*  And for the first time that anyone can remember, the moderates stood up for themselves, and
*  stood up in the face of this pressure campaign, and they blocked Jim Jordan.
*  And that sent a message, I think a lot of us in the press corps believed, that there
*  would be a demand for a more mainstream or moderate candidate.
*  And that led to the nomination of Tom Emmer of Minnesota on Tuesday afternoon, who is
*  the number three House Republican, and perhaps the most moderate of all the potential candidates
*  or leading candidates that have had a real chance at becoming speaker this year.
*  And what makes him so moderate?
*  Well, he has taken a number of votes that I don't think seem that moderate to much of
*  the country, but they do to the hard right.
*  For instance, he voted to prevent discrimination against same sex couples, and he refused to
*  object to certifying President Biden's 2020 victory at a time when Donald Trump was putting
*  intense pressure on House Republicans to overturn the election and keep him as the president.
*  So Emmer is kind of a moderate House Republicans dream candidate for the speakership, but of
*  course, we know that overall House Republicans are not so moderate.
*  So how does Emmer contend with that?
*  So Emmer is hopeful that he has the backing of the mainstream Republicans, but also has
*  won enough friends on the hard right to make sure that he can become speaker.
*  But what becomes quickly apparent is that although a majority of House Republicans support
*  Tom Emmer, Donald Trump does not.
*  Donald Trump, the de facto leader of the Republican Party who has a lot of influence in the House
*  Republican conference, just put out a blistering statement attacking Tom Emmer.
*  Here's what Trump said.
*  Voting for a globalist rhino like Tom Emmer would be a tragic mistake.
*  And allies of Donald Trump go out on the airwaves and on their podcasts.
*  I couldn't support Tom Emmer.
*  We need a speaker of the House that reflects the values and the views of Republican voters
*  across the country.
*  And they support President Trump and they support his agenda.
*  And Tom Emmer does not.
*  And start ripping him apart.
*  He certified the fake election.
*  He has been the wrong vote every single time.
*  He is Nancy Pelosi in a suit.
*  They say he's not loyal to Trump.
*  And everyone who watches the war room posse in the show needs to fight Tom Emmer every
*  step of the way.
*  Emmer starts defending himself.
*  He endorsed Donald Trump twice.
*  He has pictures of him with Donald Trump in his office.
*  He starts circulating those photos to media outlets to show how loyal he is to Donald
*  Trump.
*  But it's still not enough for the hard right.
*  So just four hours after he becomes the nominee, despite winning a majority of the votes, there
*  are still about two dozen hard right House Republicans standing in opposition to him,
*  refusing to vote for Tom Emmer.
*  And Tom Emmer sees no other way out of this than to resign and renounce his candidacy
*  for speaker.
*  Hmm.
*  So it turns out there are enough moderates to kill a Jordan candidacy, but not enough
*  moderates to elect Tom Emmer.
*  That's exactly right.
*  And so Republicans are sent back to square one and they're kind of scraping the bottom
*  of the barrel now to figure out who could be the speaker.
*  So after Tom Emmer is deposed, six more Republicans throw their names in as potential candidates.
*  Because basically everyone thinks like, why not me?
*  That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, there's a joke that every senator looks in the mirror and sees a president.
*  And we're quickly learning that every member of the House, every male member of the House,
*  I might say, looks in the mirror and sees a speaker.
*  And so what happens to all these men looking in the mirror, seeing a speaker?
*  Well, six of them vie for the next round of votes.
*  I guess this is the fifth time Republicans will try to nominate a speaker.
*  And one name starts to rise above all the others.
*  Democracy is messy sometimes, but it is our system.
*  And that is someone who's far to the right of Tom Emmer, who has no problem with objecting
*  to the 2020 election results.
*  This conference that you see, this House Republican majority is united.
*  And that is Mike Johnson of Louisiana.
*  This is servant leadership.
*  We're going to serve the people of this country.
*  We're going to restore their faith in this Congress.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Luke, tell us about this fourth nominee to be the Republican House speaker, who I'm
*  going to be really honest, I had never heard of before now.
*  Right. And there's a good reason you haven't heard of him.
*  He hasn't been in Congress that long.
*  He's not the chairman of any major committee.
*  He is, in fact, not the chairman of any committee.
*  And he's kind of a little known member of Congress.
*  But here's what we do know about Mike Johnson.
*  He is very conservative and he's also very religious.
*  Welcome back to Truth Be Told.
*  I'm Mike Johnson.
*  And I'm Kelly Johnson.
*  He hosts a podcast with his wife that's focused on Christianity.
*  Today, we're going to provide an answer to the question that has been asked by countless
*  hundreds of millions of people and probably by all of us at one point or another.
*  How do I find God's will for my life?
*  He often talks about being an evangelical Christian.
*  And those Christian views, those conservative Christian views really do shape his politics.
*  Roe v.
*  Wade gave constitutional cover to the elective killing of unborn children in America.
*  Period. You think about the implications.
*  He's also very close with Jim Jordan, the two of them have traveled to Israel together
*  to meet with Benjamin and Yahoo.
*  When you and Kelly went with Polly and I to Israel a couple of years ago, what a good
*  time we had a chance to learn about our great friend and ally, the state of Israel.
*  And Jim Jordan serves as a mentor to him and sort of helped him run for Congress
*  originally and flew him out to meet with the House Freedom Caucus guys.
*  And just like Jim Jordan is very loyal to Donald Trump, so is Mike Johnson.
*  If Jim Jordan was the public face of fighting the 2020 election results in Congress,
*  Mike Johnson was his silent partner.
*  He was the constitutional lawyer behind the scenes coming up with various legal ways
*  and theories that Congress could try to overturn the results of the election.
*  The first thing he did was he tried to get members of Congress to sign on to an
*  ultimately failed lawsuit to throw out Joe Biden's victory in four different states.
*  That lawsuit's rejected by the Supreme Court, but not before Mike Johnson gets 60
*  percent of House Republicans to sign on to it.
*  And he does this by telling them he has spoken with President Trump and President Trump
*  will be looking at the list of names and taking account of who supported him and who
*  didn't.
*  Interesting. So Johnson seems even further to the right than Jim Jordan and thus, I
*  would imagine, very unpalatable to those 20 or so moderates who had such problems
*  with Jordan.
*  Yeah, a lot of us in the press corps thought when we heard his name that, you know,
*  moderates would stand against him as they did against Jim Jordan.
*  But this time that just didn't happen.
*  Well, why not?
*  Why would moderates not object to him?
*  Well, I think there's a couple of reasons.
*  Some of the moderates we talked to in the hallways said essentially they were weighing
*  the continued dysfunction of the House and the need to get back to business against
*  how right-wing Johnson is.
*  So was it worse for them to have Mike Johnson as speaker and potentially support a
*  right-wing candidate when they're from a district that's more of a swing district or
*  a purple district?
*  Or was it worse to continue the three-ring circus taking place on Capitol Hill, head
*  towards a government shutdown, deny funding for our allies overseas?
*  So you can see how they looked at the situation and arrived at the result that it was
*  better for them to vote for somebody just so they could get back to business.
*  Right.
*  You're saying these moderates start to worry less about picking the wrong speaker and the
*  political repercussions of that than they do about picking no speaker and being associated
*  with a deeply dysfunctional Congress because voters don't like that either.
*  That's exactly right.
*  And one thing that differentiates Johnson from Jordan is that he doesn't have the
*  baggage in some members' views as Jordan did.
*  You've got to remember, Jim Jordan came to Congress and was described by a previous
*  Republican speaker as a legislative terrorist.
*  Right.
*  And he had blown up a bunch of bills to fund the government and sort of the basic bills
*  of keeping the place open.
*  And so there were long memories about Jordan's misdeeds in their mind.
*  And Johnson just doesn't have the bad blood with his fellow Republicans that Jordan does.
*  And so that combined with the fact that there's a lot of fatigue on the Hill.
*  People are sick of not having a speaker.
*  They're sick of going home on the weekend and having their constituents yell at them
*  because they're so dysfunctional.
*  And all of that built up to really a glide path for Mike Johnson, a guy who would have
*  had probably no chance of becoming speaker a month ago, to having the unanimous support
*  of his conference.
*  Right.
*  So I want to just review the journey that we have been on.
*  Kevin McCarthy is ousted as speaker by these far-right members of the House, just eight
*  of them.
*  The first nominee to replace him ends up being rejected as insufficiently conservative.
*  The second nominee is knocked out not because he's not conservative enough, Jim Jordan
*  was, but because he's personally kind of hated.
*  The third nominee fails because he's not conservative enough, Tom Emmer.
*  And ultimately the winner is a very, very conservative member, Mike Johnson.
*  So there's not a lot of mystery about, ideologically speaking, who won here.
*  House conservatives won.
*  So how should we think about why this was such an ugly 21-day war among people who
*  largely seem like they're on the same page?
*  In many ways, this is really the first sort of MAGA-controlled House.
*  Before this, we had Democrats in charge of the House or we had Republican speakers who
*  were more in line with the old Republican Party, right?
*  The more business-minded wing of the party who cared about small budgets and aggressive
*  military.
*  Now it's a much more populist party that's remade in Donald Trump's image.
*  It's people, for the most part, who don't like the status quo, who want to tear down
*  the establishment, who want to blow things up.
*  And so when you have a ton of people like that in the same room, it's essentially a
*  wrecking ball that's flying around all the time and it's unclear who's going to be hit
*  at any given time.
*  And so we saw over the course of this first year of this Congress, an unprecedented five
*  different speaker nominees.
*  And then what did they get out of the fifth nominee?
*  The most conservative, the most hard right, the guy who literally did Donald Trump's
*  bidding in trying to overturn the election, who actually served as one of his lawyers
*  at one point in time and as an advisor.
*  And in fact, Matt Gaetz, who is the member of Congress who got Kevin McCarthy kicked
*  out as speaker, goes on Steve Bannon's podcast, Steve Bannon, a Trump ally.
*  It is going to be a great moment for the House.
*  And you know what?
*  At the very end, and boasts that they have had an upgrade at speaker and the swamp is
*  on the run.
*  The MAGA is ascendant.
*  And if you don't think the move in from Kevin McCarthy to MAGA Mike Johnson shows the
*  ascendance of this movement and where the power in the Republican Party truly lies,
*  then then you're not paying attention.
*  But they are.
*  They've got a more MAGA member who is now leading the United States House of Representatives.
*  But look, this outcome, it feels like potentially a momentary pause in that ever swinging
*  wrecking ball within MAGA House Republican politics.
*  And that pause where everyone can get on the same page before they begin wrecking each
*  other again, it might be a few months.
*  It might be a few days.
*  It might be a few hours.
*  We don't really know.
*  And so how should we think about Mike Johnson's chances of being a successful speaker?
*  Because 21 days ago, the first chapter of this began, a speaker was ousted.
*  That could happen all over again, given everything you just said.
*  Right.
*  Well, Mike Johnson has been able to do something that no other speaker candidate could do.
*  He was able to unite House Republicans in a way no one else has.
*  He looks like he has the command of the party.
*  But that said, this is a particularly unruly Congress.
*  Mike Johnson will probably have a grace period for some period of time, but eventually he's
*  going to have to make some decisions about keeping the government open, about the debt.
*  And it's hard not to see a scenario where some of the same complaints and concerns that
*  the hard right had with Kevin McCarthy might come back to Mike Johnson.
*  Keep in mind the same rule that hard right Republicans used to oust McCarthy is still
*  in effect in the Congress.
*  So at any point, a member can call, can force a vote to remove a speaker.
*  This Congress has been one that ends up eating its own.
*  And so the test for Mike Johnson will be how long can he hold off until they eat him too?
*  Well, Luke, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  And this group will deliver for the American people.
*  I said it in the chamber and I will say it here.
*  We're going to govern well.
*  On Wednesday afternoon, about an hour after his election, Speaker Johnson held a brief
*  news conference on the steps of the Capitol.
*  We're so grateful.
*  I'm so grateful and so humbled to have gotten a unanimous vote on the floor by all of my
*  colleagues here.
*  Johnson said he would dispense with the usual ceremonies and celebrations of a new speaker
*  and immediately get to work.
*  We went through a lot to get here, but we are ready to govern.
*  And that will begin right away.
*  You've all heard me talk a lot today and I'm not going to belabor the point because the
*  sun is bright and it's too warm for the ball.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to another day.
*  At least seven people were killed and many more injured in a mass shooting in the town of
*  Lewiston, Maine, where a gunman reportedly opened fire at a restaurant and bowling alley.
*  As of Thursday morning, a massive manhunt was underway to capture the shooter who was
*  caught on camera using what appeared to be an assault rifle.
*  Lewiston, Maine's second biggest city, is about 40 miles north of Portland and home to
*  Bates College, where students were told to shelter in place.
*  And on Wednesday, with little warning, Hurricane Otis made landfall near the Mexican resort
*  town of Acapulco as a catastrophic category five hurricane.
*  Unlike most storms that intensify slowly and are tracked closely by meteorologists, Otis
*  gained strength with stunning speed, its winds growing by 110 miles per hour in just 24 hours.
*  In interviews and social media posts, residents and tourists described widespread damage from
*  the storm.
*  Today's episode was produced by Michael Simon Johnson and Rochelle Banja.

*  Powell and Marian Lozano, and was engineered by Chris Wood.
