# The Sunday Read: ‘Bariatric Surgery at 16’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9QkwfMbJHA)
*  Hi, my name is Helen O-Yang. I'm a contributing writer for the New York Times Magazine and
*  I'm also an associate professor in emergency medicine at Columbia University. This episode
*  of the Sunday Read is a recent story of mine about an epidemic and the controversial methods
*  to contain it. It's not about the coronavirus, but another epidemic. This one arose at a
*  surprisingly fast rate. Then it worsened during the pandemic in part because of it. And that
*  epidemic is childhood obesity. In the 1970s, 5% of children in the United States were considered
*  obese. Today, that number is 20%. And according to the CDC, severe obesity has been going
*  up the fastest. In response, this past January, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued
*  guidelines telling doctors how they should screen and treat children with obesity. And
*  for the first time, the AAP recommended treating all children diagnosed with obesity. This
*  was new because in the past, the strategy had been watched for waiting. For adolescents,
*  the AAP presented options that have been mostly reserved for adults. Things like bariatric
*  surgery, which involves removing or stapling your gastrointestinal tract or weight loss
*  medications. The thinking behind bariatric surgery is that it's not the equivalent of
*  wiring your jaw shut so you physically can't eat more food. It's much more than that. Your
*  hunger hormones and other chemicals change in profound ways so you can actually lose the desire
*  to eat more. Many people felt that the AAP guidelines were too aggressive. Critics said
*  that the hyper-focus on a child's weight could itself lead to eating disorders. The screening
*  methods for obesity used a measurement of BMI or body mass index. Some questioned that number
*  altogether, saying that the standards for a, quote, healthy BMI were set based on a white European
*  male population, ignoring variations in race, ethnicity, and gender. There's also an additional
*  controversy because some of the studies that have been done on the ties between obesity and life
*  expectancy have arrived at different results depending on the controls. So the eating disorder
*  community was asking if we're not even positive that being obese has consequences on our health
*  and on our life expectancy. Why are we even making people endure these treatments? Why are we shaming
*  them? What many critics latched onto were the AAP's recommendations for invasive treatments,
*  particularly bariatric surgery, saying that kids' brains aren't developed enough to understand the
*  fallout. Yes, maybe you're eating smaller meals, but also you're taking vitamins for the rest of
*  your life. You can't grow back the part of your stomach that's cut out. It's permanently gone.
*  As a physician, I had seen lots of articles written about adults getting bariatric surgery,
*  but I hadn't seen an in-depth one about children. I then met Alexandra Duarte, who is one of the
*  main characters in the story you're about to hear. Alexandra had just turned 16 when I met her.
*  She told me that ever since she was a toddler, she's always had some extra weight. She also had a
*  condition called polycystic ovary syndrome, which contributed to her obesity. Alexandra's
*  doctors mentioned bariatric surgery, and her mother was interested from the beginning.
*  She had seen how it helped her adult friends. Until then, Alexandra had tried all manner of
*  things, from diet pills to fasting in order to control her weight. She had suffered through the
*  teasing and bullying at school, and she was determined to do something. Only now,
*  her doctor was recommending an extreme surgery that would take months to prepare for, take away
*  around 80% of her stomach, and have lifelong consequences. So here's my article, Bariatric
*  Surgery at 16, read by Sonila Nankhani. The audio for this episode was produced by Tali Aboukassas,
*  and original music was composed and performed by Aaron Esquizito.
*  Last fall, Alexandra Duarte, who is now 16, went to see her endocrinologist
*  at Texas Children's Hospital outside Houston. From age 10, she had been living with polycystic
*  ovary syndrome, and more recently, pre-diabetes. After Alexandra described her recent quinceañera,
*  the doctor brought up an operation that might benefit her, one that might help her lose weight,
*  and as a result, improve these obesity-related problems. Alexandra, who smiles shyly and speaks
*  softly but confidently, says she was a little skeptical at first, because, like, it's a surgery.
*  But her mother, Gabriela Velez, suggested that her daughter consider it.
*  Ever since I was a toddler, my mom knew that I was struggling with obesity, Alexandra says.
*  Through the years, Alexandra seemed to have tried everything. She went through periods when she
*  avoided all carbs, and days when she drank only water. She turned to commercial products,
*  from Herbalife to diet pills to meal replacement shakes. Desperation and hope led her to try
*  gimmicky lotions that promised to burn fat. Puberty seemed to make things worse.
*  Her doctors dispensed basically the same talk everyone else gives me, she says.
*  Follow the government's MyPlate plan. Eat lots of vegetables. Have anything, but don't overdo it.
*  Her mother diligently prepared her meals, cooking vegetables in ways that she liked.
*  Alexandra herself worked on getting fuller on less, trying to limit each meal to a single
*  plateful. Almost everyone in her immediate family carries extra weight, including her
*  younger twin brothers, who put on more weight during the pandemic. But neither her father,
*  nor the twins, nor another brother copied her efforts. Seeing them eat ice cream and cake
*  made her vegetables less enticing. I have a huge sweet tooth, she says.
*  The teasing started in fifth grade. Alexandra couldn't eat without her classmates staring at
*  and judging her. Though she sought counseling for her sadness and anxiety, these troubles
*  still caused her to leave school for a month. The bullying finally stopped after she switched
*  schools in tenth grade, but Alexandra's parents knew how deeply she continued to suffer.
*  How much more could their daughter endure? After the doctor suggested bariatric surgery,
*  an operation on the gastrointestinal tract that helps patients lose weight, they spoke to friends
*  who had successfully been through the procedure as adults. They decided it was a smart option for her.
*  Alexandra wasn't sure, however. When the family met the surgeon, Jose Ruben Rodriguez,
*  he was quick to tell them that the operation was no shortcut. Indeed, Alexandra first had to
*  complete the hospital's strict, comprehensive behavior and lifestyle program, which lasts
*  six to nine months. This effort would demonstrate her commitment to improving her health while also
*  preparing her for surgery and life afterward. Many teenagers find this step too challenging.
*  Rodriguez estimates that less than one-third of them end up receiving the surgery after
*  their initial appointment. For Alexandra, the program's tasks mimicked what she had tried
*  already. Keeping food journals, drinking more water, setting sleep schedules, which in turn
*  often means restricting access to phones. She was also instructed to exercise. As someone who loves
*  dancing to K-pop songs in her bedroom and going to the gym with friends, Alexandra didn't find that
*  difficult either. I guess for some people it could be intense, she says, but it honestly to me felt
*  a little bit easy. Alexandra also saw a dietician, a psychologist, a gynecologist, and a social worker.
*  She was tested, too. Blood draws, ultrasound, x-rays, sleep study. With each appointment,
*  she felt increasingly comfortable with the prospect of an operation.
*  It was especially helpful to hear Rodriguez explain the procedure, called a sleeve gastrectomy,
*  and describe the experiences of other teenagers who had been through it.
*  After several months of deliberating, she decided to go ahead. The other would-be fixes
*  really solved the problem, Alexandra says. No matter how many pounds I lose, I gain it back,
*  and it's sometimes even more. It made me feel discouraged with my efforts,
*  like maybe I wasn't trying hard enough. Alexandra is one of the roughly 20% of children
*  in the United States living with obesity, up from 5% in the 1970s. Another 16% or so
*  are considered overweight. The prevalence of obesity increases as children get older,
*  to more than 22% among adolescents, from around 13% in 2-5 year olds.
*  At 5'1 and 209 pounds, Alexandra had a body mass index that placed her well above the threshold
*  for severe obesity, which is 120% of the 95th percentile, according to the CDC's
*  Extended BMI for Age Growth Chart. Without treatment, Alexandra would almost
*  inevitably have obesity into adulthood. And the longer that continued, the more at risk
*  she would be for chronic health issues, like joint pain and problems with breathing and sleeping.
*  Worse, some children in her situation can develop what were once considered adult illnesses.
*  Hypertension, diabetes, fatty liver disease. Obesity can also magnify mental health problems.
*  Teenagers with obesity are more likely than those without obesity to contemplate suicide.
*  Severe obesity is the fastest-rising subcategory among youth. An epidemic within an epidemic,
*  as the American Academy of Pediatrics calls it. During the pandemic, the rate of increase
*  in children's BMI doubled. The greatest gains were in those who were already overweight.
*  Worldwide, the rates of pediatric obesity, which is not solely an American affliction,
*  could double by 2035. In response to so many grim facts, the AAP in January released its first
*  clinical practice guideline for those who care for children who have obesity.
*  The Academy now recommends that they immediately start intensive health behavior and lifestyle
*  treatment, which it labels the foundation of obesity management. This approach supersedes
*  the former strategy of watchful waiting. For older youth in certain circumstances,
*  those with a higher BMI say, drugs and in cases of severe obesity, surgery should be made available
*  as options. The guideline supports what the evidence supports, Sarah Hampel, its lead author,
*  told me when she described the years-long review process. We didn't go beyond that.
*  Semiglutide, one of the newest drugs being used for weight loss, was approved for adolescents 12
*  and older at the end of December, shortly before the AAP guidelines were released.
*  Ozempic is the brand name of one semiglutide formulation that has dominated headlines and
*  social media for its off-label use in helping adults swiftly and effortlessly shed pounds.
*  The drugs seem to offer a promising remedy, though it is too early to know if their use among
*  adolescents will be as widespread. Also, it is unclear if the drugs will be sufficient to
*  treat severe obesity. For now, surgery, a treatment of longer standing, whose rates have increased
*  substantially among teenagers over the last decade, remains the most effective intervention for them.
*  As soon as the recommendations were announced, they were met with fierce criticism for their
*  screening and treatment methods, especially drugs like semiglutide and the surgery Alexandra opted
*  for. Critics claimed that these approaches are far too aggressive and subject children's bodies to
*  unnecessary scrutiny and manipulation, potentially distorting how they view themselves, and that
*  treatments could lead to eating disorders that cause more damage than obesity itself.
*  Some critics challenged BMI, a controversial measurement, and argued that doctors should
*  not be diagnosing obesity in children at all. But, Hample emphasizes, the decision for treatment
*  is really in the hands of the families, rather than the doctors. In June, grasping her white-stuffed
*  puppy with floppy ears and her red blanket printed with gray hedgehogs, Alexandra waited
*  in the pre-op area. She was nervous, but not as nervous as she is, she said, pointing to her mother.
*  Gabriela nodded and said, I think I'm thinking too much.
*  Alexandra's father sat quietly beside her as she tried to keep busy by drawing in her sketchbook,
*  eventually burying her face in her stuffed animal.
*  The tenacity of body weight can be traced to our biology.
*  Humans evolved to resist losing body fat so that we don't become extinct, says Rudolf Liebel,
*  chief of the Pediatric Molecular Genetics Division at Columbia University's Medical Center.
*  Scientists are still trying to unravel that evolutionary process. According to the
*  thrifty gene hypothesis, which has been around for over a half century, we gain weight, and keep it
*  on, to help us prepare for and survive periodic famines. In 2008, John Speakman, an eminent
*  British biologist, coined the Drifty Gene Hypothesis. As human survival came to depend less on escaping
*  predators, random gene mutations allowed our upper weight limits to drift higher. Today, our brains
*  may be regulating our body weight so that it stays within a range between upper and lower thresholds,
*  while perhaps fighting harder to keep us above the bottom one.
*  After all, starvation poses more immediate danger than obesity.
*  You cannot get a person to chronically defend a lower level of body fat by chronically
*  restricting their calories, Liebel says. But, he adds, that level may be pushed up by virtue of
*  environment. Our brains are non-consciously defending that higher weight, Stefan Guionet,
*  a neurobiologist and the author of The Hungry Brain, told me. And they are even capable of
*  slowing down our metabolism to that end. The hypothalamus, seated deep in our brains,
*  is the master of this tightly regulated system. Cone-shaped and no larger than an almond,
*  it's involved in determining if we're hungry and accordingly prompts us to increase our food intake,
*  or if we're satisfied, decrease it. It also helps control our metabolism.
*  The hypothalamus responds to signals sent from parts of the body, including our fat cells and
*  guts. Signals like leptin, an important hormone that Liebel helped discover, which increases when
*  body fat rises, telling our brains to stop eating. A small number of children with severe
*  obesity are born with leptin deficiency, a gene mutation identified by Sadaf Farooqi,
*  a professor at the University of Cambridge's Institute of Metabolic Science. Their appetites
*  seem to be bottomless. Though it's rare, Farooqi cites the extreme effect of this mutation as a
*  clear illustration of the very strong impact that biology has upon appetite. When Farooqi
*  treated children with this deficiency by injecting them with leptin, they reduced their consumption.
*  Too much leptin made them stop eating entirely. We can literally control how much they're eating
*  by the dose of leptin we're giving them, she says. In other words, appetite is not entirely
*  within our conscious control or willpower. Grelin, a hunger hormone, increases when food
*  intake is restricted, making us eat more. Insulin, another important hormone, helps turn the food we
*  eat into energy and controls things like blood sugar that influence how much we eat.
*  Hunger is absolutely instinctual, Guionet told me. We don't decide whether we're going to be hungry
*  or not, whether we're going to have a craving or not. And while we might be able to control
*  our intake for a meal or a week, we probably can't do so every time we eat for a lifetime.
*  Even our brain's reward system, which interacts closely with the hypothalamus,
*  motivates us to seek high-calorie food. There's just a lot of different ways your brain can kind
*  of sneak calories, he says. These regulatory systems have their tendrils everywhere.
*  Genetics may determine more than 70% of children's body weight. Single-gene mutations are extremely
*  rare. The most common one affects up to 5% of children with severe obesity.
*  Farooqi says that nearly all children with obesity are living with the cumulative effect of many
*  different genetic variants, resulting in a bigger appetite. So far, about 1,000 have been identified,
*  most of which act on appetite and hunger, and there are probably many thousands more.
*  Each variant might have a very slight impact. The strongest might be responsible for one person
*  being 5 pounds heavier than the next. But, Farooqi says, when you add them up together,
*  they probably explain why some people are much more likely to get obese than others.
*  But if our genes didn't change significantly in the last century, why then are children getting
*  bigger? No one knows for sure. One likely explanation, however, is the evolutionary
*  mismatch between our genes and our surroundings. Children who end up with obesity were always at
*  the highest genetic risk for that outcome, even if it wasn't certain to develop. But now, Farooqi says,
*  the environment is likely unmasking their genetic susceptibility.
*  The most substantial transformation in their surroundings has been to the food they eat,
*  which in the past was different in its composition and far more limited.
*  LIBEL refers to a revolution in human environments, and notes that our genes haven't changed fast
*  enough to accommodate something that's really an invention of the past 75 years. The amount of
*  readily accessible food has expanded immensely, making it easier than ever to eat. Open a phone
*  app, say, or go to a drive-thru. Plenty of Americans can consume as much as they want
*  whenever they want. Today, nearly 70% of what children eat is ultra-processed food,
*  which the NOVA classification system, a commonly used framework, defines as having been formulated
*  from ingredients mostly of exclusive industrial use, typically created by series of industrial
*  techniques and processes, which makes them extremely flavorful. These foodstuffs include
*  things our great-grandparents would not have consumed. Packaged chips, energy drinks, ready
*  to heat and eat meals. They are thought to be an important driver of the childhood obesity epidemic,
*  in part because they seem to make us eat more. Kevin Hall, a researcher at the National Institute
*  of Health, found that even when meals are matched for calories, carbohydrates, protein, fat, sugar,
*  salt and fiber, study participants who are instructed to eat freely will still, without
*  realizing it, consume an average of 500 calories more a day if the food is ultra-processed.
*  Any kid is going to choose an ultra-processed food, says Marion Nestle, an emerita professor
*  of nutrition, food studies and public health at NYU and the author of Food Politics. Nestle traces
*  the deregulation of food marketing to the Reagan presidency and the shareholder value movement.
*  After 1980, kids were fair game, she told me. Corporations began aggressively marketing their
*  products to children, potential lifetime customers who are easily influenced.
*  Ultra-processed foods appeal to parents, too. They're cheap, last for years in pantries and
*  freezers and require little preparation. All food companies are trying to sell products, Nestle says.
*  That's the system. And if the system makes kids fat, well, too bad. Collateral damage.
*  In the United States, that damage is inflicted more harshly on some groups of children than others.
*  The obesity epidemic disproportionately spares white and Asian children and those from
*  socioeconomically advantaged families. Living in the highest opportunity neighborhoods,
*  especially at birth, could be associated with as much as an 80% lower risk of obesity.
*  Among black children, however, the protective effect of income against obesity seems to be weaker.
*  Over the past few decades, the variety of food items in some supermarkets has risen to more than
*  40,000 from 7,000. These modern industrial products should not be recognized as foods at all,
*  says David Ludwig, a pediatrics professor at Harvard and co-director of Boston Children's
*  Hospital's Obesity Prevention Center. It's up to parents and all of us to fight back
*  and not to normalize these. The AAP urges doctors to demand more of our government
*  to modify the food being sold to children. But Barry Popkin, a nutrition professor at
*  the University of North Carolina who has worked with countries on their food policies,
*  remains skeptical that similar regulations could be enacted soon in the United States,
*  like Columbia's tax on ultra-processed foods or Chile's restrictions on them in schools
*  and on advertising. We need our FDA to be bold, Popkin says. We need a food czar who's tough,
*  not these namby-pamby bureaucrats that don't really want to ruffle any feathers.
*  At Texas Children's Hospital, Alexandra lay asleep in the operating room on a tilted bed
*  with her feet lower than her head. Gravity now worked to the surgeon's advantage,
*  pulling her intestines away from her stomach.
*  Rodriguez, wearing a peanuts-themed cap with his scrubs, made five half-inch incisions throughout
*  her abdomen, while the music of Bruno Mars and Elton John softly played in the O.R.
*  Rodriguez then inserted a camera and his tools through the cuts.
*  Alexandra's insides appeared on four surrounding screens.
*  Rodriguez pulled back her liver, its edges rounded from fat, and pushed aside mounds of squishy
*  yellow fat, findings that he sees only in his bariatric patients, to reveal her stomach,
*  pink and patterned with red vessels like fine tree branches.
*  The anesthesiologist had snaked a tube through Alexandra's mouth into her stomach.
*  Rodriguez could now follow the contour of the tube with a surgical device
*  that sequentially cut, stapled, and sutured stomach tissue.
*  Next came what Rodriguez regarded as the hardest step, wrestling the excised portion of the organ,
*  about 80% of the whole, out through one of the tiny incisions.
*  To make sure that what remained of her stomach had been fully stitched up,
*  the anesthesiologist pumped air through the tube into the organ, which now resembled a
*  slim shirt sleeve, hence the procedure's name, sleeve gastrectomy, and Rodriguez flushed water
*  into her abdomen. Bubbles would indicate a leak somewhere.
*  The water was still. The operation was completed in under an hour.
*  Most of Alexandra's stomach now sat on a tray, cool and dusky.
*  In another room, with children's artwork adorning the bright aqua walls, Alexandra's parents sat on
*  orange chairs and waited, until Rodriguez came in and knelt next to them.
*  There's no blood loss at all, which is nice, he told them in Spanish.
*  In the post-operative area, Alexandra, still confused from the anesthesia, writhed around.
*  With every movement, she hurt.
*  It's so hard to see her like this, Gabriela said, as she smoothed her hand over her daughter's
*  forehead and begged her to lie still. Alexandra let out a moan.
*  When we first started, the hospital business people told us there's not enough surgeries to
*  justify building a program, Rodriguez told me. Obviously, that's not how things turned out.
*  It's the exact opposite. The number of teenagers who underwent
*  bariatric surgery more than doubled nationwide between 2010 and 2017, and continues to rise.
*  According to Teen Labs, which is funded by the National Institutes of Health
*  and which has been conducting the most research on the procedure in the United States,
*  adolescents who have had bariatric surgery, most of them white and female,
*  experienced weight loss similar to what adults lost, around 25% of their BMI.
*  And while nearly 90% of these teenagers needed diabetes medications before the operation,
*  none did afterward. Five years later, they were more likely to have their diabetes and hypertension
*  in remission compared with people who had surgery as adults.
*  There's a greater positive impact for operating on youth with these two conditions
*  than waiting until adulthood, says Thomas Inge, chair of surgery at Lurie Children's Hospital
*  in Chicago and the principal investigator of Teen Labs.
*  You get more out of the same operation. Even 10 years after the procedure,
*  the data indicates that there are long-term benefits from surgery.
*  Teenagers do not seem to experience more complications than adults.
*  Patients lose weight, and they're less hungry while they're doing it,
*  says Randy Seeley, a professor at the University of Michigan
*  who researches the surgery's effects on a molecular level.
*  Seeley emphasizes that weight loss doesn't simply result from a newly tiny stomach
*  that limits how much people can eat. Many chemical changes are also responsible,
*  some of which resemble what happens when people are on ozempic, although these similarities are
*  not thought to be the main mechanism behind surgery's effectiveness. The crucial roles
*  instead seem to be played by bile acids and antimicrobial peptides in the gut,
*  each of which increase markedly after surgery. Seeley is still sorting out the exact mechanisms
*  of their influence. Also, a majority of the stomach that secretes ghrelin, the hunger hormone,
*  is removed in sleeve gastrectomies. Why bariatric surgery works so well is because you're changing
*  lots of things at the same time, Seeley says. Most important, bariatric surgery seems to reset
*  to a lower bound the body weight that the brain tries to maintain. There is less of the persistent
*  metabolic slowing that accompanies traditional weight loss. Based on fMRI scans, the response
*  to food cues in the brain, around the hypothalamus and in the reward and cognitive control regions,
*  appears to be different in post-surgical patients than it is for those on low-calorie diets.
*  But how altering the anatomy of the gut changes the brain is still a mysterious phenomenon.
*  Mostly a black box, Seeley says, and it still seems to surprise everyone,
*  even those who perform the operation. I'm just a basic gastrointestinal surgeon,
*  Inge says. Never thought I'd get to claim to be a brain surgeon,
*  but hey, that's where it seems like the impact is.
*  Only a tiny fraction of the teenagers with severe obesity who qualify actually receive the operation.
*  The obstacles in front of them are hard to get past. Finding a pediatric bariatric surgeon,
*  navigating the long, arduous process of insurance authorization,
*  assuming the procedure is even covered by the insurer.
*  We've seen all sorts of shenanigans for trying to not approve kids, Inge says.
*  Some parents, desperate to help their struggling children, feel they have no choice but to pursue
*  treatment without insurance coverage. In 2021, after Acacia Studstill tried to take her own life
*  by overdosing, she and her mother Anastasia traveled from Florida to Tijuana, Mexico,
*  for bariatric surgery. The trip, including the sleeve gastrectomy, cost around $6,500.
*  People questioned me taking her out of the country, Anastasia says,
*  but you don't know what I'm dealing with. The bullying, she would shut down for days.
*  She was going to kill herself. This summer, Acacia told me she had lost a third of her weight.
*  Wearing a crisscross black halter top, she beamed while packing up her room to start her freshman
*  year at Florida State University. There's always more options than just giving up,
*  she said. You don't have to diet and starve yourself.
*  Several studies have shown an increased risk of suicide in adults after bariatric surgery.
*  This association may not be a result of patients already at higher suicide risk,
*  like Acacia, choosing to go through with the operation.
*  Meg Zeller, a professor at Cincinnati Children's Hospital who researches the relationship between
*  mental health and pediatric bariatric surgery and has studied the teen labs cohort,
*  has not found this link. But she cautions that adolescent data is just a different ballgame
*  compared with the abundance of long-term data generated by adult cases. Data from eight years
*  out shows that alcohol use disorder is higher after bariatric surgery, possibly because the
*  operation causes alcohol to be metabolized more slowly. While feelings of stigma and body image
*  can improve, Zeller told me that anxiety or depression may not subside to the extent that
*  diabetes often does. All teenagers experience life changes and increased vulnerability.
*  She explains, we're talking about intervening at a time in someone's life when lots of challenges
*  can exist that are unique to that age group. The morning after her operation, Alexandra,
*  her hair and pigtails, shuffled slowly around her hospital room. She steadily took tiny sips of water.
*  There's no going back now, she said.
*  There's no going back now, she said.
*  If our biology, ingrained by evolution, is no longer well engineered for our modern surroundings,
*  can pharmaceuticals help redesign us?
*  One medicine that Alexandra took, metformin, which reduces glucose, has a moderate benefit
*  for teenagers like her who also have prediabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome.
*  But the latest glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, as a group commonly referred to
*  as ozempic, are the true game changers.
*  A class of drugs that are making possible a degree of weight loss not seen before with medications.
*  The pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk manufactures GLP-1s for weight loss, one of which is semaglutide,
*  and sold under the brand name Wegovi.
*  Ozempic is the brand name for a lower dose version of semaglutide that is prescribed
*  to treat diabetes by increasing insulin, but has become so popular in the last year
*  for cosmetic weight loss that it has helped Novo Nordisk's market value surpass the gross domestic product
*  of Denmark, where the company is headquartered.
*  GLP-1s are the new frontier of anti-obesity medications, says Erin Kelly, co-director
*  of the University of Minnesota's Center for Pediatric Obesity Medicine.
*  In a 16-month study that appeared in December in the New England Journal of Medicine, co-authored by Kelly,
*  adolescents lost 16% of their BMI on semaglutide compared with the placebo group, which gained 0.6%.
*  The treatment group also registered improved cholesterol and liver tests.
*  Both cohorts underwent lifestyle therapy.
*  Semaglutide, currently administered through weekly injections at home, suppresses appetite
*  primarily by acting on GLP-1 receptors in the brain.
*  It may also reduce cravings by modifying the brain's pleasure pathways.
*  Outside the brain, it slows down the transit of food through the gut, so the feeling of fullness lasts longer.
*  When you put those three things together, the appetite, the satiety, and the suppression of cravings,
*  all of a sudden, you get a medication that has pretty profound effects on reducing weight.
*  Kelly explains,
*  I think we're entering a new phase of pediatric obesity medicine,
*  where we're going to continue to see increasingly effective and durable treatments.
*  For several years, Arianna Stovall, who just turned 14, has tried unsuccessfully to reduce her meal portions.
*  Her attempts at more healthful eating were also thwarted by the temptation of junk food in the house
*  and her younger siblings, who do not have obesity, love to eat.
*  I would crave junk food 24-7, Arianna says.
*  She snacked late at night on Doritos and strawberry shortcake in her bedroom.
*  Her mother, who is a nurse, raised the AAP guidelines with their pediatrician,
*  but she doesn't prescribe weight loss medications.
*  When I spoke with Arianna in May, she had been on WeGoV for a month after the family found an obesity specialist.
*  At first, I was really scared because I don't like shots, she told me, but it felt like a little instant pinch.
*  For the first two weeks, Arianna didn't notice a change.
*  Then her mother observed that she was full after finishing half her plate, instead of asking for her usual seconds.
*  Since the surgery, fruits and vegetables are tasty to me now, Arianna says.
*  I think the medicine did something to my taste buds.
*  The major studies of children and these drugs have enrolled many fewer adolescent subjects than adults,
*  but no new safety concerns have emerged.
*  In addition to semaglutides' principal side effects of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea,
*  reported by two-thirds of study participants, more serious ones include gallstones and pancreatitis.
*  WeGoV comes with a caution about possible thyroid cancer,
*  and the FDA mandates that it include a warning about the possibility of suicidal ideation because it acts on the brain.
*  Further studies are being conducted in Europe.
*  If patients discontinue the medicines, the weight returns.
*  Compared with fenfen, a popular weight loss drug in the 1990s that was eventually linked to heart valve problems,
*  doctors are less concerned about semaglutide because older drugs in its class have been used to treat diabetes for nearly two decades.
*  But for any new medicine, the long-term risks remain uncertain.
*  For now, most adolescents who qualify for semaglutide probably won't be able to get the drug at all.
*  I always say it's an insurance game.
*  Trea Haggerty, a family medicine obesity doctor at West Virginia University Medicine, told me,
*  What hoops can you jump through?
*  If families pay out of pocket, monthly costs could reach $1,400.
*  We're creating haves and have-nots, Haggerty says.
*  Even with insurance, parents may still encounter drug shortages.
*  Novo Nordisk is already restricting the U.S. supply of starter doses into 2024, effectively limiting new patients.
*  Ariana was forced to stop Wegovi when the drug became unavailable to her this summer.
*  She switched to an older, less effective GLP-1, but then that went on backorder, too.
*  We are so devastated, her mother texted me recently.
*  It seems like a very big mountain we are climbing.
*  For every child given a diagnosis of being overweight or having obesity, even those who choose medication or surgery,
*  the AAP encourages immediately starting intensive health behavior and lifestyle treatment, like the one Alexandra undertook.
*  For younger children, this may be the only therapy available to them.
*  Amanda Stianno, a developmental psychologist who helped write the AAP section on lifestyle programs,
*  describes them as trying to re-engineer the child's environment and helping with positive parenting strategies.
*  This spring, Michael and Christy Piantosky took their five-year-old daughter, Emmy, to one such program in Madison, Mississippi,
*  a state with one of the highest childhood obesity rates in the country.
*  They were referred by Emmy's pediatrician because she was gaining weight rapidly.
*  Her BMI was pulling upward away from her growth curve on the CDC's BMI chart.
*  At their first appointment, Emmy's parents told the doctor, Whitney Herring, that they were worried about Emmy's appetite.
*  She eats, then she'll immediately be like, can I have a snack? Or when are we eating? Michael said.
*  If we didn't stop her, she would keep asking for more and more, Christy added.
*  She would get mad at us for having more than she did.
*  We wanted Emmy to see somebody before kindergarten, Michael says.
*  We know how kids are these days. We just don't want her to be bullied.
*  Herring told them not to expect a fast fix.
*  Even with the body mass index coming down, that is often not a quick process, she said.
*  If kids see any reduction in BMI from lifestyle treatment, the average is a 1-3% change in percentile,
*  though other health indicators may improve.
*  Herring asked about Emmy's meals.
*  We're working on it, Christy said. The only vegetable that she will eat is carrots.
*  What about at school? Herring asked.
*  Christy described a lunch with green beans and peas.
*  The doctor turned to Emmy, who is blonde with ruddy cheeks and dimples.
*  Do you like those at school? No, I never eat those.
*  Do you ever have broccoli at school? No.
*  We are very picky, too, Christy said. She avoided most vegetables herself.
*  Some families have trouble affording vegetables or lack the time to prepare them.
*  At school, children like Emmy may not touch their lunch or they might snack from vending machines.
*  But improving school meals involves more than just substituting asparagus for fries.
*  Judith Sibart, a dietitian who worked with schools nationally, recalls being told,
*  Next, Rebecca Bagwell, the program's dietitian, wheeled in a cart stacked with silicone foods.
*  She pulled out a seven-inch plate sectioned into different proportions for various foods groups,
*  following my plate suggestions.
*  Emmy chose what she liked, chicken, mac and cheese.
*  As Bagwell piled them on the plate in generous portions.
*  So do you feel like you would want more or less than this? Bagwell asked.
*  Emmy looked at the plate. More?
*  Some of Herring's patients have trouble getting exercise.
*  One boy, who told me the farthest he has walked is down his block, signed up for track team.
*  But the school never started practice.
*  His experience is not uncommon among poorer youth, whose sports participation rates are lower.
*  And while two-thirds of ninth graders attended physical education weekly in 1991,
*  only one-third did so in 2019.
*  Though exercise alone may not result in profound weight loss, it has extraordinary health benefits
*  and helps our brains regulate appetite.
*  Herring has expanded her program to cover three different parts of the state,
*  but she still expects as much as 30 percent of her appointments to be no-shows,
*  a problem for many lifestyle treatment programs.
*  From parents missing work to children missing school, families have trouble going to them,
*  if they can find one at all.
*  Herring reckons that the AAP's recommendation that patients attend at least 26 hours in person
*  over three to 12 months is not feasible for most.
*  I have yet to find even the most motivated person who's willing to do two visits a month.
*  Many primary care doctors do not have a program like Herring's to refer their patients to.
*  It puts more pressure on me to make sure that I'm not only identifying these kids,
*  says Sarah Hart, a pediatrician in Kentucky.
*  But in the short time that I do have with them, how can I really home in
*  and find those areas that we can make a real sustainable change?
*  It can seem like an impossible ambition to achieve in 15-minute primary care appointments.
*  How the medical community approaches patients' weight,
*  and whether it should even be diagnosing or treating obesity,
*  has led to all sorts of criticism, which has been growing ever since the American Medical Association
*  declared in 2013 that obesity is a disease.
*  While some people felt relief in knowing that they had a medical disorder,
*  many others felt injury in being considered diseased.
*  As weight became a preoccupation in doctors' offices,
*  and the size of people's bodies became subject to medical treatment,
*  even if they seemed otherwise healthy,
*  patients felt increasingly more stigmatized and concerned that the care they received was biased.
*  Remedies that were meant to help with obesity instead seemed to be hurting the people with the condition.
*  One of the most vehement responses to the AAP guidelines
*  came from the Collaborative of Eating Disorders organizations.
*  This idea of weight loss for higher weight children,
*  I think all of us were just completely taken aback, says Joanna Candel,
*  chief executive of the National Alliance for Eating Disorders,
*  who helped spearhead an open letter from CEDAW that responded to the guidelines.
*  Calling them harmful and irresponsible,
*  the letter's foremost concern was that screening and treating children for obesity
*  can lead to eating disorders, for which youth at higher weights are already at increased risk.
*  Tracy Richmond, who directs the Boston Children's Eating Disorder Program,
*  explains that weight loss in children can trigger eating disorders
*  by making them hyper-fixated on weight and body, which can then spiral out of control.
*  As children continue to restrict their intake,
*  they can become undernourished relative to where their body would like to be,
*  a type of anorexia, even if their BMI may not have fallen into the low range.
*  Other eating disorders, bulimia, binge eating, also may emerge.
*  CEDAW's open letter registered its unequivocal opposition to treating children with obesity
*  with drugs or surgery on the grounds that the long-term effects of these procedures
*  on pediatric patients haven't been well studied and could also worsen disordered eating.
*  But criticism was also directed at pushing children to make lifestyle changes.
*  What the journalist Virginia Soul Smith calls textbook diet culture marketing
*  in her 2023 book, Fat Talk, because these can also eventually lead to eating disorders.
*  Soul Smith has written for this magazine.
*  While research has shown that intensive treatments focusing on health and lifestyle behaviors
*  decrease eating disorders, some experts have pointed out that those studies don't track children
*  long enough to know if they end up developing disorders.
*  Most of this research followed the children for only a year or less.
*  Such concerns raised by CEDAW are particularly worrisome,
*  given that the rate of eating disorders doubled in teenage girls during the pandemic.
*  Focusing on weight in medical settings can also worsen the care children receive.
*  Two-thirds of people with obesity report experiencing bias from doctors.
*  In extreme cases, this can result in devastating consequences,
*  including missed or delayed diagnoses, even death.
*  The health care system may blame parents for their children's weight
*  and accuse them of overfeeding or not providing enough healthful food.
*  A few states have even moved children with severe obesity into foster care.
*  The pushback against conceiving weight as a medical problem
*  has brought intense scrutiny to the act of measuring obesity.
*  The backlash against BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared,
*  has been especially forceful.
*  BMI doesn't take into account whether the weight comes from muscle or fat
*  or where in the body it's distributed.
*  In June, the AMA began to move away from the measurement
*  when it acknowledged that BMI cutoffs are based primarily on data
*  collected from previous generations of non-Hispanic white populations
*  and does not consider a person's gender or ethnicity.
*  For now, the AAP still endorses BMI,
*  in part because alternative measurements can't readily be performed in most pediatricians' offices.
*  Diagnosing people whose BMIs exceed a certain level with obesity, a disease,
*  can increase weight stigma outside medical settings as well.
*  Our entire concept of fat is bad is so rooted in anti-blackness, white supremacy,
*  Soul Smith writes, when we strive for thinness,
*  we're reinforcing every other form of stigma at the same time.
*  People in larger bodies may be perceived as lazy, stupid, or sloppy
*  and are constantly vulnerable to insults, slights, and jokes.
*  Stigma can also be surprisingly insidious.
*  If parents say, fruits and veggies are awesome because it helps us lose weight,
*  the weight stigma starts to creep in, says a Janet Tomiyama, a psychology professor at UCLA.
*  Experiencing stigma or discrimination because of body size
*  can worsen or even cause health problems.
*  When it comes to individuals, it's undeniable that people with obesity can be metabolically healthy,
*  just as normal weight individuals can be unhealthy.
*  Some studies have even shown that normal weight individuals
*  may not live as long as those with higher BMIs.
*  Findings like these, along with a greater awareness of the drawbacks
*  that can accompany the medicalizing of obesity,
*  have fueled popular body positivity movements like Health at Every Size,
*  which seek to disentangle weight from health.
*  But despite the risks that can accompany obesity treatments,
*  and despite the fact that the data doesn't always present a clear picture,
*  the prevailing attitude within the medical establishment is that, on balance,
*  the potential negative consequences of obesity are too evident to ignore.
*  When Andrew Stokes, a demographer and public health professor at Boston University,
*  used people's weight histories and adequately accounted for important factors like smoking and illnesses,
*  he found that obesity was associated with significantly shorter lifespans.
*  Studies can't prophesy what will happen to any one person, he says,
*  but this is about probabilities and relative risks.
*  He adds that obesity is a cumulative process.
*  Children with obesity may not be dying of heart attacks,
*  but the Bogaluca Heart Study, one of the longest-running epidemiological studies,
*  it recruited children in the 1970s and followed them through middle age,
*  has nonetheless found that childhood obesity is already associated with cardiovascular
*  and kidney changes that then developed into diseases in adulthood.
*  These findings have been confirmed by autopsies of youth who died in accidents.
*  During the pandemic, obesity was the most common medical condition associated with deaths of people under 21.
*  Lila Monahan, a primary care pediatrician who uses BMI as a screening tool to help prevent diseases,
*  asks why you would wait until someone started developing abnormalities.
*  She says that's like saying someone has high blood pressure,
*  but they're not having heart attacks, so why are we even measuring their blood pressure?
*  Though the AAP guidelines include advice on how to minimize weight bias and avoid stigmatizing patients,
*  and even though they recommend screening children with obesity for eating disorders
*  and were even vetted by eating disorder experts, Hample told me,
*  such safeguards may not be enough.
*  The potential harm that the CEDAW letter warns about became a reality a few years ago
*  for a fifth grader whose middle name is Esther.
*  Her school in New Jersey sent home a letter to be signed,
*  a BMI report card that said her BMI was greater than the 95th percentile for her age.
*  The signature that was required was not her parents, but her doctors.
*  The pediatrician told her mother, Lynn, also a middle name, that the weight gain was not a big deal
*  and mentioned an academic medical center's program that you guys may want to look into.
*  The first session taught Esther to assign traffic lights to foods, vegetables green, candy red.
*  They weren't like, oh, you're too heavy, Lynn says.
*  It was more like, this is a way to be healthier and change your lifestyle
*  so you can keep this as part of your routine for the rest of your life.
*  Esther seemed uncomfortable, though, and cried in the car afterward.
*  The whole family can do better to eat healthy, Lynn reassured her.
*  Esther refused to go back.
*  But that summer, she told her parents she was trying to be healthier.
*  She started eating less and walking to school.
*  Then her weight began to drop.
*  The following spring, Esther was diagnosed with anorexia.
*  Overall, she needed four hospitalizations and five months in a residential treatment facility
*  across the country during the pandemic.
*  There, she kicked so hard to resist a feeding tube that she nearly broke Lynn's ribs.
*  Later, Esther's heart rate plunged dangerously.
*  We almost lost her, Lynn says, her voice cracking.
*  Esther is better now, but her family remains unsettled.
*  The pandemic's social isolation was central to her daughter's eating disorder, Lynn says.
*  But the lifestyle program was probably the catalyst for it.
*  I'm feeling more confident in myself, like I'm no longer wanting to hide away in a jacket or hoodie,
*  Alexandra told me in October.
*  Four months after her surgery, she has lost more than 50 pounds and
*  is thrilled to feel good wearing a dress for the first time in a long time for homecoming.
*  I'm so proud of her, Alexandra's mother says.
*  She's doing so great.
*  Alexandra's improved health means she has been able to stop taking her diabetes pills.
*  She will, like all patients who receive bariatric surgery,
*  have to take vitamins for the rest of her life,
*  in part because her altered gastrointestinal tract does not absorb nutrients as well.
*  A decision she made at 16 will continue to affect her entire life.
*  For someone like Fatima Cody Stanford,
*  a specialist at Harvard who cares for both children and adults with obesity,
*  that's a positive thing.
*  Redirecting Alexandra's health in this way is how clinicians should approach childhood obesity.
*  Stanford, who has been using many of the therapies in the AAP guidelines for over a decade,
*  sometimes sees her pediatric patients, or their families,
*  defer more aggressive treatment, then grow up into adults with obesity,
*  which may pose even greater dangers to their health and be harder to treat,
*  a progression Stanford would like to interrupt when people are still young.
*  Many people still have this really strong intrinsic belief that if it's not diet and exercise,
*  then you must have just failed as a human being, particularly in the pediatric population, she says.
*  As increasingly more effective remedies become available to children like Alexandra,
*  more of them might be set up to lead longer, healthier lives,
*  the reason the AAP put out such comprehensive and urgent guidelines.
*  Yet they are also the same children that others fear will be deeply harmed the most
*  by these very recommendations, and in ways that they may not grasp at such a young age.
*  Alexandra still exercises most days, but it's tough to balance a routine with a demanding junior year,
*  two AP classes, SAT prep, competing for a summer language program in South Korea.
*  After her operation, dining out with her family has become less enjoyable.
*  She feels full so easily now, even when meals taste delicious and she wants to eat more,
*  she can't, because she is no longer hungry.
*  Sugar also makes her feel nauseated, so she avoids sweets, even though she really wants them sometimes.
*  But, Alexandra says, she was so disheartened before the surgery,
*  putting so much effort into losing weight and feeling like she was accomplishing nothing.
*  Now, she says, it's refreshing to see the hard work I'm putting in is finally showing results.
*  you
