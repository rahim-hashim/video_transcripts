*  I'm Raja Abdrahim and I'm a reporter in the Jerusalem Bureau and I've been covering
*  the Warren Gaza for the past three weeks.
*  On Friday I was reporting out a story about basically it was a sentiment that I was trying
*  to hear a lot from people that death felt inevitable.
*  There's now more than 8,000 deaths in Gaza, more than a third of them children and we're
*  hearing basically entire families are being killed in one strike.
*  I spoke to a woman in Gaza.
*  Her name is Ulfettel Claret.
*  She told me that 70 members of her family had been killed.
*  Ands, uncles, cousins, you know, she'd almost lost count of them.
*  And what she was telling me and what I've been hearing a lot is that these huge death
*  tolls and when everybody around you, when everybody you love is being killed,
*  it just makes people feel that their turn is next.
*  The smell of death actually hangs in the air because there's so many bodies more than a thousand
*  that are under the rubble because they don't have the equipment or they don't have the ability
*  to get them out.
*  I also spoke with a poet in an essayist, Musab Abu Taha.
*  And he was telling me about how when you're sitting in your home or wherever you are and you hear
*  the approach of a rocket, it the sound feels like it's coming for you.
*  Like it feels like it's intended for you.
*  And I asked him some more questions, but I suddenly noticed that the messages weren't being
*  delivered and I wasn't hearing back. And it wasn't until a little later that we realized that
*  all phone and internet in Gaza were down.
*  It was very scary to have no eyes on the ground and to not know what was happening
*  in the middle of the war zone. Luckily our stringer Amira, her husband, actually has an Israeli
*  SIM card and she was able to message us.
*  Okay, just to explain the situation here in Gaza to the industry, it's like a really crazy
*  situation. I got a very panicked message from her and in this moment she's talking
*  as a Palestinian, as a journalist, as a mother.
*  People are very scared and terrified. They keep asking us, as a journalist, do you know what happened?
*  What's the news? Is there any ceasefire? Where they bombed last night?
*  And she told me that there was so much fear and so much panic and so much confusion on the ground
*  because everybody was worried what did this blackout mean and what was Israel planning to do.
*  Morning, Rizsa. We all find here in the camp so far we don't know what's happening in Gaza.
*  Even we cannot even enrich my family, like my mom, my sisters in Gaza city to check how they are
*  or if they survive this night or not.
*  And that's the thing with this blackout isn't not only where people in Gaza
*  cut off from the rest of the world but they were cut off from each other.
*  During the night they were very heavy bombing and a lot of the clashes like shooting,
*  but we hear the shooting, we hear that there is like fight.
*  And what was happening was that it was the most intense night of the war so far in terms of
*  Israeli air strikes. A lot of Palestinians described it as the most terrifying night they'd ever lived.
*  By cutting the communication and the telephone lines, they cannot even be called the ambulance
*  or called the civil defense or call anyone to come to help them.
*  She was telling me about how the ambulance services because nobody was able to call them.
*  They didn't know where to go.
*  They are looking for the smoke to know exactly where is the area of the bombing and they are asking
*  people around to reach the area where the bomb so they can go and tell people.
*  And so some of them were following the sounds of people screaming or they were basically just driving
*  through the streets looking for places that had been recently hit with Israeli air strikes.
*  And then suddenly Sunday morning the phone and internet was restored.
*  People's phones were started getting messages and a lot of it were messages, you know,
*  of other family members trying to check up on them, but also it was a lot of the news of what
*  had happened since Friday night. And they saw that Israel had started to conduct its ground invasion
*  and this causes obviously a whole new level of fear.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavranisi and this is the Daily.
*  Over the weekend, the Israeli military appears to have begun an invasion of the Gaza Strip
*  with tanks rolling into the enclave and Israeli soldiers fighting with Hamas inside.
*  But the operation remained shrouded in secrecy with Israel revealing little about its actions.
*  Today, my colleagues Raja Abdul Rahim and Patrick Kingsley on the latest escalation in the war.
*  It's Monday, October 30.
*  Patrick, we're reaching you on Sunday at about 3 pm Eastern time and that's 9 pm your time in Jerusalem.
*  And we just heard from our colleague, Raja, she was talking about how things had changed in Gaza
*  over the weekend. And I'm wondering if you can tell us what you know about what happened
*  in Israel over the past three days. Start on Friday for me. What did we start to see happen?
*  Early on Friday evening, we began hearing reports of a massive aerial bombardment over Gaza.
*  But at the same time, we were hearing about what was actually going on under those bombs because
*  it seemed like there was a communications blackout at that time.
*  The military was conspicuously quiet. It was hard to get any clear answers from them about
*  what was going on. In fact, it was hard to get them to pick up the phone.
*  And then finally at around 9 pm, I've met this shroud of secrecy and silence.
*  The chief military spokesman came out and made a very vague statement in which he said that
*  his well was expanding its ground activity. And as Friday bled into Saturday, we started to see
*  the first footage of tanks inside Gaza and it started to feel like this incursion into northern Gaza
*  was something more than just the hours long incursions that we'd seen on previous nights.
*  But it wasn't until late afternoon on Saturday that we felt ready to call this the invasion.
*  This was the start of the big push that we've been expecting for three weeks.
*  And what was it about what happened late afternoon on Saturday that caused you to start calling it an invasion?
*  Firstly, the fact they were still there, the fact that the military still seemed to be there
*  some 12 hours after they entered. Secondly, the information we were getting from military sources about
*  the numbers of troops that were now inside the number of tanks, the number of armored vehicles,
*  the number of bulldozers. It eventually became clear that this was a major invasive force.
*  And while it wasn't some kind of blitzkrieg rush on Gaza City, Hamas is stronghold.
*  It was nevertheless the start of what is the Israeli ground invasion of Gaza.
*  And Patrick, what about Hamas? What were they saying?
*  Hamas made two brief announcements or rather their military wing made two brief announcements.
*  They said they were engaging troops in the north and also a bit further south.
*  And that corresponds now to what we know about the Israeli invasion. They invaded around those two
*  places and clearly they ran into Hamas fighters. What those battles looked like, we don't really know
*  because there was so little information coming out of Gaza and the Israeli army were also
*  keeping very quiet about what was going on. Why was the Israeli army keeping so quiet?
*  It's not entirely clear, but we think one reason was that it wanted to maintain the element of
*  surprise, make Hamas unsure about what was going on. Secondly, we think perhaps that
*  Israel wanted to avoid scrutiny and it wants to avoid outcry across the Middle East and to
*  avoid an immediate reaction from southern Lebanon where another militia allied to Hamas,
*  hold sway, which Israelis had feared might launch its own major attack on Israel if it felt that
*  Hamas was under threat due to the ground invasion. So Israel making its advance during a communication
*  blackout and without formally announcing it themselves created a sense of uncertainty about what was
*  actually going on that therefore made journalists like us worry about reporting anything. And
*  potentially also prevented groups like Hezbollah from making their own reaction.
*  Okay, so this is the invasion that we were all anticipating, but at the same time you're saying
*  it's kind of different. What makes you say that? How is it different than what we expected?
*  I think we expected perhaps naively that we would know what was going on in real time that we
*  would have photography video of something happening. In retrospect, we now know certain details.
*  We know they entered from the northwest of Gaza, at least some of the forces
*  advanced down the Gaza coastline. There's video now that's been released from the Israeli
*  army that shows tanks and other vehicles moving along the beaches of northern Gaza.
*  A video is also emerged of a pair of Israeli soldiers standing atop what is believed to be
*  beachside hotel raising in Israeli flag. We also understand that so far the Israeli army has not
*  pushed that far deep into Gaza. It hasn't entered into Gaza City, the biggest urban center of the
*  enclave. It appears to be waiting almost surrounding the city. And this has been accompanied by
*  many statements from Israeli officials both in the military and outside saying that this is going
*  to be a long, long process and that they won't be charging into Gaza City as quickly as
*  perhaps we'd expected three weeks ago. Why do you think the Israeli military is taking this
*  kind of different approach? Do you think that they were responding to pressure from the US?
*  Well, you're right that the US has been warning Israel not to act out of emotion, not to act
*  too swiftly to make sure that they have clear plans in place before moving in.
*  Everyone's worried about the outbreak of a regional war and it's quite possible that this
*  maneuver shrouded in secrecy was intended to try and delay any prospect or regional reaction
*  for as long as possible until the invasion seemed a fatter complete that could not be stopped.
*  And perhaps that's why there was essentially a day of uncertainty and the fog over what was going on.
*  And by the time that Benjamin Netanyahu made his speech on Saturday night in which he announced
*  the second phase of this conflict, the Israeli army had already been inside Gaza for more than 24
*  hours and their presence was a fact rather than a possibility.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Patrick, you told us that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a speech on Saturday night.
*  What did he say?
*  Israel, it's more than a year.
*  He said a number of things.
*  The first is that this is the second stage of the war.
*  And that was significant because it confirmed what we'd already gathered by ourselves by that
*  point, which is that the invasion had begun. Yeah, he didn't actually use the word invasion.
*  Then he said,
*  The war inside Gaza will be long and difficult and we are ready for it.
*  And that was perhaps aimed at the Israeli public that is going to have to come to terms with
*  many losses to its own in the coming months.
*  Then he talks about meeting the families of Israeli hostages who were kidnapped during
*  Hamas's own invasion of Israeli territory on October 7th.
*  He said we would exhaust every possibility to bring up brothers and sisters back to their families.
*  That was an attempt to reassure the families of the hostages who have an almost public sympathy
*  and support that this invasion is not intended to come at the cost of those hostages' lives.
*  And what else did Netanyahu say in the speech?
*  He talked about one supreme goal to destroy the murderous enemy and ensure our existence in our land.
*  And that is maybe tilted towards the international audience. It's a reminder that for Israelis,
*  they cannot countenance living next to Hamas on its borders for another minute.
*  And then finally,
*  He says that this is our second war of independence.
*  The first so-called war of independence was in 1948 when Israel's fledgling army defeated
*  several Arab armies and Palestinian militias in order to create the boundaries of the modern state.
*  Then that war was and remains a unifying event in the minds of most Israelis because
*  it was the foundational event of the state of Israel.
*  So by talking about it, Netanyahu was trying to present himself as a unifying leader,
*  someone that can bring Israelis together after a period of great division in Israeli society.
*  And to supporters that may have felt credible.
*  To critics that would have come across as very hollow.
*  And to Palestinians, that same comment would have felt very chilling but for different reasons.
*  During the 1948 war, some 700,000 Palestinian Arabs or 80% of the Arab population of
*  Mandate Palestine, the territory that Israel was formed from in 1948.
*  Either fled their homes or forced to flee their homes never to return.
*  And that moment in Palestinian history is known as the Nakper or Katastrophe.
*  It was hugely traumatic and remains,
*  perhaps the defining moment of the Palestinian experience and is seen as almost the start of all
*  of Palestinian trauma over the past 75 years.
*  So that was Saturday, but on the ground in Gaza, things were still very uncertain and it was very
*  unclear what was going on. Okay, so that's Saturday night. Today's Sunday, tell me what we've
*  learned now that the communications have come back online. We're learning that once again,
*  there was devastating loss of civilian life in Gaza. We're learning that the fighting inside
*  Gaza appears to have taken its first Israeli casualties. The Israeli military said this morning
*  that two soldiers had been wounded during the fighting that started after the invasion.
*  And we learn from the Israeli military that they say that they have hit 450 military targets
*  throughout Saturday and early Sunday and that targets include command centers, observation posts,
*  anti-tank missile launch posts and leaders of Hamas' military wing. We also know that they say that
*  they hit 150 underground facilities, some of which may indeed be tunnels. All these are impossible
*  to verify. So Patrick, stepping back here for a minute, where do you think we are in this war right
*  now? Netanyahu has said we're in a second phase. You know, we don't know how many more there will be.
*  Where are we and where are we going? Well, the entire region is waiting for a brief to see
*  how to Hamas' allies in southern Lebanon respond. Will they up the anti, will they launch
*  missiles and rockets deeper into Israeli territory? Or will they hold fire and prevent
*  a major escalation on the Israeli Lebanese border? Inside Gaza, we are braced for what many
*  think will be the bloodiest phase of what has already been a catastrophically bloody war.
*  8,000 Palestinians have already died 1400 Israelis and the ground phase of the war is thought by
*  most analysts to be the deadliest one. Once the Israeli army moves from the countryside outside
*  Gaza City into the city itself and is met by Hamas fighters on their home turf emerging from
*  secret exit points from their tunnel network. The war is going to get very bloody indeed for
*  the Palestinian civilians, also for Hamas and also for Israeli soldiers. And quite what Gaza will
*  look like at the end of it is unclear. We're at the edge of a precipice and we don't know exactly
*  where we where Gaza are going to land. Patrick, thank you. Thank you.
*  The Times reports that the United States believes that Israel was responsible for the communications
*  laws in Gaza and that Washington had pressed Israeli leaders to restore the service.
*  On Sunday, President Biden spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone and urged him
*  to conduct operations, quote, in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law.
*  Also on Sunday, as desperation in Gaza spread, thousands of people broke into UN food warehouses
*  and took wheat flour and other basic survival items. More aid came into Gaza from Egypt on Sunday,
*  in all 33 trucks, but aid groups said it was not nearly enough.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. On Friday, the man suspected of killing 18 people
*  and injuring 13 others at a bar and a bowling alley in Lewiston, Maine, was found dead of an
*  apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. The discovery of the perpetrator of Wednesday's mass shooting
*  ended a sweeping manhunt that had forced thousands of residents throughout the region to remain
*  in their homes. Meanwhile, questions continued to build over whether more could have been done
*  to prevent the gunmen who officials said had paranoid beliefs from owning a gun.
