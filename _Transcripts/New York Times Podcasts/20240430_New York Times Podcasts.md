# The Secret Push That Could Ban TikTok
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C87xoNVuU9E)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  American lawmakers have tried for years to ban the video app TikTok over concerns that
*  its ties to China pose a national security risk.
*  Last week, they passed a law that might finally do it.
*  Today, my colleague, Sapna Maheshwari, on the secret effort behind the law, and what
*  a ban would mean for the company's 170 million American users.
*  It's Tuesday, April 30th.
*  So, Sapna, tell me about this law that just passed that potentially bans the social media
*  app TikTok.
*  We've seen efforts in the past to rein in TikTok, but this one really seems like the
*  most substantial yet.
*  It's a huge deal.
*  What this law really does is it puts the future of this hugely popular app with 170 million
*  American users into question.
*  TikTok has reshaped the way many people listen to music.
*  It's changed the way we cook.
*  It's made a whole different kind of celebrity.
*  But it's never been able to shake these concerns around the fact that it has really close ties
*  to China.
*  It's owned by a Chinese company, ByteDance, and lawmakers for years have been worried
*  that the Chinese government could somehow use ByteDance and TikTok to get information
*  on Americans or possibly spread propaganda.
*  President Trump tried to ban it in 2020.
*  The state of Montana tried to ban this app last year.
*  TikTok's largely survived those challenges, but this time it could actually be banned
*  in the United States.
*  So let's talk about this.
*  Why did this effort succeed where the other ones failed?
*  This is an interesting story.
*  The committee will come to order.
*  And it really dates back to this hearing about a year ago that Congress had with Sho Chu,
*  the CEO of TikTok.
*  Mr. Chu, you are here because the American people need the truth about the threat TikTok
*  poses to our national and personal security.
*  So members of the committee, thank you for your time.
*  TikTok has repeatedly said that it has addressed these national security concerns and that
*  there's no issue here.
*  And you can hear that when Sho Chu testified.
*  Let me start by addressing a few misconceptions about ByteDance, of which we are a subsidiary.
*  ByteDance is not owned or controlled by the Chinese government.
*  He's saying American investors are behind ByteDance.
*  Now TikTok itself is not available in mainland China.
*  We're headquartered in Los Angeles and in Singapore.
*  And I myself am Singaporean.
*  I live in Singapore.
*  The bottom line is this.
*  American data stored on American soil by an American company overseen by American personnel.
*  We are actually going above and beyond what American technology companies do to keep things safe.
*  And I look forward to your questions.
*  Thank you very much.
*  And is Congress convinced by that?
*  Congress is not convinced by that.
*  ByteDance is a Chinese company?
*  Well, ByteDance owns many businesses that operate in China.
*  Is it or is it not a Chinese company?
*  Congressman, the way we look at it, it was founded by Chinese entrepreneurs.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  I'm not asking how you look at it.
*  Fact.
*  Is it a Chinese company or not?
*  It was this really fiery five hour hearing where Republicans and Democrats asked really contentious questions.
*  We do not promote or remove content at the request of the Chinese government.
*  The question is, are you 100% certain that they cannot use your company to promote such messages?
*  It is our commitment to this committee and all our users that we will keep this free from any manipulation by any government.
*  If you can't say 100% certain, I take that as a no.
*  There's this underlying sense of distrust around the company and its ties to China.
*  I will remind you that making false or misleading statements to Congress is a federal crime.
*  I understand.
*  Again, you can go on our platform.
*  You will find that content.
*  And it becomes clear through the hearing that across the board, Republicans and Democrats largely feel the same way.
*  Mr. Chu, I got to hand it to you.
*  You've actually done something that in the last three to four years has not happened, except for the exception of maybe Vladimir Putin.
*  You have unified Republicans and Democrats.
*  So, you know, within weeks of this hearing, this small group of lawmakers gets together and they say, let's come up with a law that works where all the other ones have failed and actually make TikTok answer to its Chinese connections once and for all.
*  So tell me about this small group of lawmakers.
*  Who are they?
*  So it starts with Republicans.
*  Among them is Steve Scalise, one of the most powerful Republicans in the House.
*  And a small group sort of works together for a few months, but they realize that in order to really make this law work, they're going to need Democrats.
*  So they end up working through this House committee that's focused on China and competition.
*  And this is where the bulk of the work on this bill takes place.
*  And just to note, this is a really small group.
*  There's less than 20 key players who are working on this.
*  And all throughout, they are keeping this very, very secret.
*  And why exactly are they keeping it secret?
*  What's the point of that?
*  So this group really wanted to keep this out of the eyes of TikTok, which has a huge lobbying presence in D.C.
*  and has successfully worked to kill bills that targeted TikTok in the past.
*  And what they're really doing is looking at all of the past efforts to either force a sale or a ban of TikTok and trying to work their way through why those plans didn't succeed and what they can do differently.
*  But while the lawmakers are working on this bill, something big happens that kind of changes the politics around it.
*  And that's October 7th.
*  As the war breaks out and people start getting information about it, a lot of people are getting information about the Israel-Hamas War on TikTok,
*  especially young people.
*  Social media algorithms seem to be driving some users towards increasingly divisive posts.
*  And there's this big, messy argument spilling out into living rooms and all over the Internet and, of course, on TikTok.
*  And it's getting very heated.
*  For instance, there's this moment in the fall where a bunch of TikTok users start sharing this old manifesto.
*  I read Osama bin Laden's letter to America.
*  It's wild and everyone should read it.
*  Go read a letter to America.
*  Like, seriously, go read it.
*  That was actually written by Osama bin Laden, defending the 9-11 attacks and criticizing the United States' support of Israel.
*  TikTok users start trying to tie it to the modern day conflict.
*  Reading this letter, it becomes apparent to me that the actions of 9-11 were all just the buildup of our government failing other nations.
*  The way this letter is going viral right now is giving me the greatest sense of relief.
*  Now it's all coming to light because of Palestine.
*  And there's these accusations that TikTok may be promoting one side of the conflict over the other.
*  And a couple of researchers look at hashtags around Palestine and they say that the data they pulled shows that TikTok is showing way more pro-Palestine videos and not so much for Israel.
*  And this sets off huge alarm bells for this small group of lawmakers.
*  But isn't that just a function of the fact that TikTok at this point is the public square in the United States for young people?
*  I mean, this is what young people were talking about and this is where they're doing the talking.
*  TikTok has pushed back really forcefully against these accusations.
*  They said that Gallup polls show that young people view Israel differently than older generations.
*  They say that they're not the ones influencing what people post, that the hashtags and the videos are a reflection of the user base and nothing that they're doing to influence.
*  But for lawmakers, this doesn't really make their concerns go away.
*  Instead, this conflict shows them how TikTok could be used to spread propaganda.
*  It made lawmakers feel that TikTok could be really dangerous when it comes to shaping the views of Americans on foreign policy, on US elections.
*  And what it also does is it provides this driving force to this group that's drafting this bill.
*  And they suddenly see that this might be a way to bring more people into their effort.
*  And so heading into November, against this backdrop, they even bring in the White House and the Justice Department to help work on this bill.
*  And with the White House, they want to make sure that this is a bill that the president will support.
*  And they work with the Justice Department to shore up the language in the bill to help defend against court challenges.
*  Because the Justice Department, of course, would be the one that would have to defend the bill, right?
*  That's exactly right.
*  And so they're trying to make it as rock solid as possible so that they can win in court when TikTok challenges this law.
*  And so March rolls around and they decide that it's time to unveil this bill that they've been working on for close to a year.
*  The battle over TikTok on Capitol Hill is intensifying.
*  This morning, House lawmakers have agreed unanimously to move a bill to a full floor vote.
*  And TikTok is caught completely flat footed.
*  They didn't see this coming. And this is just what the group wanted.
*  So TikTok has this army of lobbyists that's suddenly scrambling and they go into damage control mode.
*  They start reaching out to members of Congress.
*  This app is so much more than just an app for dumb TikTok dances.
*  They fly a group of TikTok stars and small businesses to come to D.C.
*  and lobby on the steps of the Capitol and meet with lawmakers.
*  Standing up here with all these amazing TikTokers behind me is a complete honor.
*  Every single one of them would voice their opinion just like this.
*  This is how we feel. This has to stop.
*  They set up interviews between these TikTok creators, as they're known, and big TV shows and news programs.
*  And they're doing everything they can to fight against this bill before it goes any further.
*  And then they decide to do something unusual, which is use TikTok itself to try and derail this bill.
*  How exactly do they do that?
*  So days after this bill is announced, a ton of TikTok users get a message when they open the TikTok app
*  that basically says, call Congress and tell them not to ban TikTok.
*  OK, so like literally this window comes up and says, call Congress. Here you go.
*  Exactly. You can enter your zip code and there's a button that appears and you can press it.
*  And the call goes straight to your representative.
*  Oh, wow.
*  So offices are quickly overwhelmed by calls.
*  And TikTok sent out this message to users on the same day that a House committee is going in to vote on this bill and whether to move it forward.
*  And so the stunt happens. They go in to vote and they come out and it's 50 to zero in support of the bill.
*  One of the representatives who worked on the bill said that this stunt by TikTok turned a lot of nos into yeses and yeses into, quote, hell yeses.
*  So the whole episode sounds like it actually backfired, right?
*  Like, TikTok stunt essentially just confirmed what was the deepest fears of lawmakers about this company, that the app could be used to influence American politics.
*  That's definitely how a lot of lawmakers viewed it.
*  And when this bill is brought to the full House a week later, it passes by an overwhelming majority.
*  And weeks later, it passes in the Senate as part of a broader aid package.
*  And on Wednesday, it's signed into law by President Biden.
*  But now the question is, what does it mean?
*  Like, how will this actually work and how will it affect the tens of millions of Americans who use TikTok every day?
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Sapna, now that Biden has signed this bill, what does it actually mean in practice for TikTok?
*  What does the law do?
*  So the law is really trying to push ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, to sell to a non-Chinese owner.
*  And the company basically has nine months for the sale to happen.
*  There's an option for President Biden to add another three months to that clock.
*  And if the company doesn't find a buyer or refuses to be sold, it will be banned.
*  And what would a ban actually mean, Sapna?
*  I mean, people would still have the app on their phones, right?
*  So it wouldn't disappear overnight.
*  Yeah, no one's coming to pick up your phone and to forcibly delete this thing.
*  What the law says is that app stores and web hosting services wouldn't be allowed to carry TikTok anymore.
*  So basically, it would kind of die a slow death over time where it wouldn't be updated and just kind of peter out.
*  So the bottom line here is that the clock has started on this potential sale, right?
*  They have 12 months to find a buyer.
*  So what are the obstacles here?
*  I mean, it sounds pretty ferociously complicated.
*  There's a ton of challenges here and it's a very messy choose your own adventure.
*  So one of the first big questions is who could buy this?
*  Right. By dance and TikTok are private.
*  We don't know their financials, but analysts estimate that it will cost tens of billions of dollars.
*  That narrows the buying pool pretty quickly.
*  And a lot of the companies that could afford to buy it, like Metta, the owner of Facebook or Google,
*  which owns YouTube, would probably be kicked out of the sort of running because they are simply too big.
*  Regulators would say, you already own these big apps.
*  You can't possibly add this to your stable.
*  There'd be a monopoly concern there.
*  Exactly. And then there's a lot of questions around how this would work technically.
*  By dance and TikTok are very much global organizations.
*  You have the CEO in Singapore.
*  They have huge operations in Ireland.
*  They have this big workforce in the U.S.
*  And of course, they do have engineers in China.
*  So how do you extract all those things, make it all work?
*  It's a very big international transaction.
*  Right.
*  And then there is the chance that the Chinese government blocks this sale and says you cannot do this by dance.
*  We will not allow it.
*  So how does that actually work, though, in terms of China?
*  I mean, can China actually just ban the sale of this company?
*  I mean, it is a private company after all, right?
*  Well, here's one way it could work.
*  The Chinese government could block the export of TikTok's algorithm.
*  And let me explain that in kind of plain English.
*  Please.
*  They could basically block the technology that fuels the TikTok-iness of this app,
*  the recommendations, the magic of it, why you see what you see when you're looking at TikTok.
*  TikTok-iness? Is that an adjective?
*  That is now an adjective.
*  Nice.
*  And there's a chance that Beijing could say, hey, you can't export this technology that is proprietary.
*  And if that happens, that suddenly makes TikTok way, way less valuable.
*  So the Chinese government could let the sale go through potentially, but as a kind of an empty shell, right?
*  The thing that makes TikTok TikTok, the algorithm wouldn't be part of the company.
*  So that probably isn't very appealing for a potential buyer.
*  Exactly.
*  And I mean, the role of the Chinese government here is really interesting.
*  I've talked to experts who say, well, if the Chinese government interferes to try and block a sale of this app,
*  doesn't that underscore and prove all the concerns that have been expressed by American lawmakers?
*  If you're worried about China being in control of this thing, well, that just confirmed your fears.
*  Exactly. And it's an interesting thing that ByteDance and TikTok have to grapple with.
*  So bottom line here, selling TikTok is quite complicated and perhaps not even possible for these reasons that you're giving, right?
*  I mean, not least of which, because the Chinese government might not allow the algorithm to leave the country.
*  And that's not something that the U.S. Congress has a lot of control over.
*  So is this law fundamentally just a ban then?
*  That's what TikTok is calling it.
*  Right after this bill was signed into law on Wednesday.
*  Make no mistake. This is a ban. A ban on TikTok and a ban on you and your voice.
*  TikTok CEO made a TikTok. What else?
*  That explained the company's position.
*  The freedom of expression on TikTok reflects the same American values that make the United States a beacon of freedom.
*  He actually argued that TikTok reflects American values.
*  TikTok gives everyday Americans a powerful way to be seen and heard.
*  And that's why so many people have made TikTok part of their daily lives.
*  And he said that this law infringes on the First Amendment free speech rights of Americans who love it and who use it every day.
*  The facts and the Constitution are on our side and we expect to prevail again.
*  So it's very clear that TikTok plans to challenge this law in court.
*  And the court fight to follow will determine the fate of TikTok's future in the U.S.
*  So is that First Amendment argument that the TikTok CEO is making here going to work?
*  Nobody wants to put money on that.
*  I mean, the company is really approaching this with the idea that the First Amendment rights of Americans are being infringed on.
*  But if you remember, the government has been working on this law.
*  They've been anticipating those challenges and they can justify an infringing of First Amendment rights in certain cases, including with national security concerns.
*  And so it'll be up to a judge on whether those concerns pass muster and justify the sale and even a potential ban of TikTok.
*  Got it. So TikTok will argue free speech, First Amendment, and the government will counter by saying, look, this is about China.
*  This is about America's national security interests.
*  That's right.
*  And the legal experts that I've spoken with say this is a really big and sticky area of the law and it's a huge case.
*  And they really think that this will go to the Supreme Court, regardless of who wins in kind of the first round of this.
*  So where does that leave the millions of Americans who use TikTok and many of them, of course, who earn a living on the platform?
*  I mean, it's really uncertain what happens now with the company.
*  And the clock has started ticking.
*  When I looked at TikTok and looked at videos from users.
*  This is about the impending TikTok ban.
*  And it just triggered me so much, makes my blood boil and I have to get this out there.
*  There's a lot of shock.
*  The most success I've had has been here on TikTok.
*  And now they're trying to take it away.
*  This is so stupid.
*  And anger.
*  You can't ban apps.
*  You can't ban things from people.
*  People are confused.
*  Word on the street is that in the next nine to 12 months, TikTok could be banned.
*  And they're also caught a bit off guard just because there have been these years of efforts to do something about TikTok.
*  People on the app have been hearing about a TikTok ban really since 2020.
*  Like the government can take away a literal app on our phones and we're supposed to believe we're free.
*  A few TikTokers have said, you know, how can this be the thing that the government is pushing through so quickly?
*  Can we stop funding a genocide?
*  No.
*  Can we get free COVID tests?
*  No.
*  Can we stop killing the planet?
*  No.
*  Can we at least watch videos on an app of people doing fun things and learn about the world around us?
*  No.
*  So there's this sense of distrust and disappointment for many people who love this app.
*  We got rid of TikTok.
*  You're welcome.
*  Detecting you from China.
*  You know that phone was made in China.
*  And I think there's also this question too around what about TikTok makes it so harmful,
*  even though it has increasingly become a place for news.
*  There's plenty of people who simply use this app for entertainment.
*  And what they're seeing out of Washington just doesn't square with the reality they experience when they pull out their phones.
*  And I wonder, Sapna, I mean, just kind of, you know, stepping back for a second,
*  Let's say this ban on TikTok succeeds if it goes through.
*  Would Americans be better off?
*  It depends who you ask.
*  For the users who love TikTok, if it actually disappeared,
*  it would be the government taking away a place where maybe they make money,
*  where they get their entertainment,
*  where they figure out what to read or what to cook next.
*  To free speech advocates, this would be dystopian.
*  But for the American political class and the national security establishment,
*  this is a necessary move, one that was years in the making,
*  not something that was just come up with on the fly.
*  And ultimately, it all comes down to China.
*  And this I think is a very important point.
*  And I think it's a very important point.
*  And I think it's a very important point.
*  And I think it's a very important point.
*  And I think it's a very important point.
*  And this idea that you can't have a social media app like this,
*  a source of news like this,
*  that is even at all at risk of being influenced by the Chinese government
*  and our greatest adversaries.
*  Sapna, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Monday, in its latest high profile showdown with pro-Palestinian protesters,
*  Columbia University gave students until 2 p.m.
*  to clear out from an encampment at the center of campus or face suspension.
*  It appeared to be an effort to remove the encampment
*  without relying on New York City police,
*  whose removal of a previous encampment there two weeks ago
*  inspired similar protests on campuses across the country.
*  This is Sharon Otterman reporting for the New York Times.
*  A 2 p.m. deadline for protesters to clear out of the encampment
*  at the center of Columbia University has come and gone.
*  And there's still quite a large contingent inside the encampment.
*  But Monday's warning seemed only to galvanize the Columbia protesters
*  and their supporters.
*  Hundreds of students and others from around the campus have come out to support them.
*  They are currently walking around in a picket around the encampment.
*  Hundreds of students, standing four or five people deep,
*  encircled the encampment in a show of solidarity.
*  They were joined by members of the Columbia faculty.
*  There's also dozens of faculty members who are prepared to stand in lines
*  in front of the main entrance to the encampment
*  in case public safety or the NYPD move in.
*  But as of June, there was no sign of that happening.
*  Then, on Monday evening, Columbia announced it had begun to suspend students
*  who had failed to leave the encampment.
*  It was unclear exactly how many students had been suspended.
*  You can't hide!
*  You can't reach the status quo!
*  You can't reach the status quo!
