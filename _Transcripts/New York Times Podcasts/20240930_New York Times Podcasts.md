# Alliance vs. Isolation Harris and Trump’s Competing Views on Foreign Policy
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DX5CxSrkBo)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernese and this is The Daily.
*  As the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East deepen, the U.S. under President Joe Biden
*  has taken a leading role in both.
*  But now the presidential campaign is raising a new and consequential question.
*  Whose foreign policy will the world get next?
*  Today my colleague Peter Baker explains.
*  It's Monday, September 30th.
*  So Peter, we're just weeks away from Election Day and the United States is deeply involved
*  in protracted wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.
*  These will be issues for whoever is the next president.
*  So we wanted to talk to you about how the two candidates might approach these conflicts
*  in foreign policy more broadly.
*  Just this weekend we saw the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Lebanese militia
*  group Hezbollah, by Israel.
*  And I really want you first to start with just what the stakes are here.
*  Yeah, I don't think the stakes could be higher for the Middle East to erupt into a wider
*  war, which is the fear in Washington right now in the thick of a presidential campaign
*  just reminds us of how important America still is in the world, right?
*  That we are not in fact behind an ocean where we can not care about what happens across
*  the globe.
*  But where it's going to go at this point in the Middle East, we don't know.
*  The fear is that the killing of Nasrallah, who was mourned by nobody in the United States,
*  he has blood on his hands after decades of leading a terrorist organization, but his
*  killing could inflame the region in a way that President Biden has been trying to avoid
*  for almost 12 months now.
*  And the idea of a wider, more expansive war in the Middle East, one that not only escalates
*  with Hezbollah itself, but possibly brings in its patron, Iran, that is a huge challenge.
*  And therefore, of course, it's extremely important to know who's going to take over in just a
*  few weeks.
*  And the difference between these two candidates in their outlook, in their vision, in their
*  approach to the world could hardly be bigger.
*  So let's go to the candidates themselves.
*  Tell me how you see Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in terms of how they would steer America
*  in the world, like high level.
*  Well, Kamala Harris, of course, hasn't had a lot of experience in foreign policy, but
*  she's learned a lot at the side of President Biden as his vice president.
*  So we're sort of guessing a little bit about her vision and her views.
*  I think our general assumption is that she's pretty close to where Biden is.
*  And I think it's safe to assume that she is basically a pretty conventional center left
*  democratic foreign policy thinker.
*  I mean, to the extent that she brings her own individual perspective, it probably comes
*  from her time as a prosecutor and a lawyer, that she believes in the international rules
*  based order.
*  So she looks at foreign policy in the sense of who is following the rules in effect in
*  terms of whether it be trade, security or economics.
*  And Peter, tell me about Trump.
*  How would you describe him high level?
*  Well, high level, he is the opposite, right?
*  He is a disruptive force when it comes to international affairs, proudly so.
*  If there's anything he believes, it's this idea that other countries are shafting the
*  United States, often our own friends, our friends in Europe, our friends in Asia, that
*  they are getting one over on the United States when it comes to trade and economics, when
*  it comes to security arrangements and so on.
*  And so he's often been much harder on America's allies than he has been on America's adversaries.
*  Right, he's drawn to these strongmen in a way, and it's a real break with what came
*  before when it comes to the Republican Party and really just Washington consensus generally.
*  So on the face of it, Peter, these are two very different candidates.
*  Let's talk about how they would actually be on the issues, though.
*  Maybe let's start with this killing of Hassan Nasrallah, which plunges us directly into
*  the unknown when it comes to Israel and Iran, which is, of course, the big backer and power
*  behind Hezbollah.
*  Right. So over the last few days, what we've seen is Israel escalating the war in Lebanon
*  in a major way after a year of trading cross-border fire.
*  And on Friday, Israel struck a densely packed neighborhood just south of Beirut, killing
*  Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah.
*  And he, of course, has been such a remarkably powerful and dangerous force in the Middle
*  East now for decades.
*  It was such a shock, right, Peter?
*  Like this guy was a fixture and now suddenly he's gone.
*  It just felt like I didn't even know what world we were living in.
*  It's a paradigm changing moment, right?
*  And at the same time, Israel has continued to strike Hezbollah targets around Lebanon
*  and it's causing deep chaos within the country.
*  According to the government, there as many as a million people could be displaced.
*  And so far, more than a thousand have been killed since this ramped up offensive began,
*  including civilians, women and children.
*  And now all eyes are really on Iran and whether they will, in effect, enter the war in a much
*  bigger way than they already have.
*  They've been fighting Israel really for years through these proxy groups, a kind of shadow
*  war, but now the fear is it could be an actual all-out regional war.
*  And that might bring in the United States, too.
*  What has Washington said about this?
*  So Biden and Harris both released statements pretty similar to each other, saying that
*  this was a measure of justice for the victims of Hezbollah.
*  At the same time, they also talked about the need for diplomacy to de-escalate the conflict.
*  They're called on the parties, the combatants to agree to the ceasefire proposals that are
*  out there to end the fighting, at least temporarily.
*  Now on the Republican side, the Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson and his leadership
*  team put out their own statement praising, of course, Israel's killing of Nasrallah,
*  but also attacking the Biden administration for not doing enough in their view to support
*  Israel.
*  The one person we haven't heard from, ironically, is Donald Trump.
*  He had a whole long rally yesterday and said not one word about Hezbollah and the killing
*  of Nasrallah and gave no clue, therefore, into his thinking about what this means and
*  what the United States should be doing at this point.
*  And we know, of course, about Trump that he does have an antagonistic relationship
*  with the Iranians.
*  He pulled out of the Iran nuclear agreement, which was brokered under President Obama,
*  and put sanctions back on Tehran.
*  When we're looking at the candidates here, how do each see Iran?
*  Well, definitely Trump sees Iran as the main malign force, not only in the Middle East,
*  but one of the main enemies around the world, right?
*  He's willing to say nice things about Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un and North Korea.
*  Not one good word, obviously, for Iran.
*  I think Harris obviously sees Iran as a malign force as well, but she has been part of an
*  administration that was willing to at least try to restart negotiations over their nuclear
*  program.
*  Now, that didn't go anywhere.
*  That ended up fizzling.
*  And right now, we are at odds with Iran.
*  We have sanctioned Iran.
*  We are not part of an agreement with Iran and doesn't look like one is happening anytime
*  soon.
*  So where Harris wants to take the policy with Iran right now is a little unclear.
*  She obviously will talk about being tough on Iran, but she is not trying to raise the
*  temperature and use the same kind of language that former President Trump does.
*  So Peter, let's go to Israel, which is, of course, at the center of all of this, and
*  Israel's relationship with the United States, which is under a lot of strain right now as
*  it wages its war against Hamas in Gaza almost a year after Hamas attacked on October 7th.
*  This conflict is top of mind, I think, for a lot of voters.
*  And I'm curious how the candidates are talking about it.
*  Maybe start with Trump.
*  Well, one way it comes up on the campaign trail for Trump is the way he tries to persuade
*  Jewish American voters to support him.
*  He likes to boast of being Israel's great friend during his first term, but so much
*  so he's taken it to the point of saying that if you're Jewish and you vote against him,
*  you somehow are betraying Israel or betraying Judaism, which by the way, is a concept that's
*  very offensive to a lot of people.
*  But that's where he is framing it right now.
*  Now, it's fair to say there's probably never been a president who's been more willing to
*  give Israeli leadership what it wanted than Donald Trump, right?
*  He moved the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which is something that the
*  previous presidents had all declined to do.
*  He recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which again, no president had
*  done up until that point.
*  He closed the Palestinian office in Washington and cut off aid, and he wasn't even on speaking
*  terms with Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian authorities.
*  So in Trump, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was getting an awful lot of what he wanted.
*  But when it comes to the war in Gaza itself, Trump has been relatively quiet.
*  He really hasn't given any kind of extended analysis or interview to explain how he sees
*  the war in Gaza.
*  And in fact, if anything, when he has talked about it, he has said things that Israel's
*  supporters are uncomfortable with, like Israel needs to get this over with.
*  You got to get it done quickly because they are getting decimated with this publicity.
*  There's too much killing, not that he is expressing concern for those who are being killed, but
*  because he says it's hurting Israel's reputation in the world.
*  Israel has to handle their public relations.
*  Their public relations are not good.
*  And so he needs to get it over with.
*  I think another thing we could say is he probably wouldn't be as committed to humanitarian aid
*  for the Palestinians in Gaza as the Biden administration has been.
*  I've never heard Trump express any interest in that.
*  And he doesn't particularly like wars.
*  I mean, I think that's one thing he has tried about, not starting any wars while he was
*  president.
*  And I don't know that he feels very comfortable with an extended war in the Middle East.
*  I don't know what he would be willing to do to stop it or how far he would be willing
*  to go to pressure Netanyahu.
*  But I don't think Netanyahu can count on 100% unvarnished support like he had in the first
*  three years of Trump's presidency.
*  Yeah, it's interesting how Trump has this tough guy thing.
*  But at the same time, it's not actually militaristic.
*  He doesn't believe in using American military like traditional Republicans have.
*  And it's true, he didn't start a war, which is one of the things I always think about
*  a Trump administration and how different it was from, say, the administration of George
*  W. Bush, which was kind of a more traditional political institutionalist guy, but did start
*  this big war.
*  That's just not what Trump does.
*  Yeah, no, it's really true.
*  He's the opposite of Teddy Roosevelt, right?
*  Teddy Roosevelt was speak softly and carry a big stick.
*  Trump is speak loudly, but carry a small stick.
*  So he is actually somebody who has not been eager to pull the trigger, even though he
*  speaks very gruffly and threateningly, bellicose-ly, right?
*  Exactly.
*  And Peter, what about Harris?
*  What do we know about how she would distinguish herself from the Biden administration's approach
*  to Israel?
*  Kamala Harris has stuck close to President Biden's policy, but she sounds different,
*  right, at times.
*  Well, let's understand how we got here.
*  When she describes the situation there, it's a matter of emphasis.
*  Her emphasis on the suffering of the Palestinians sounds much more determined than when Biden
*  says that.
*  Then I say now, Israel has a right to defend itself.
*  We would.
*  She will say that Israel has every right to defend itself.
*  She will condemn the October 7 terrorist attack by Hamas in strong terms, but...
*  Because it is also true, far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.
*  Children, mothers.
*  When she speaks about it, you hear more empathy, it sounds like, to people for the suffering
*  of the civilians, at least, in Gaza, who are paying a price.
*  But we must have a two-state solution where we can rebuild Gaza, where the Palestinians
*  have security, self-determination, and the dignity they so rightly deserve.
*  And so people assume because of that that she will be tougher on Netanyahu than Biden
*  has been, that she would have less patience for Netanyahu and put more pressure on him.
*  Okay, so let's turn to Ukraine.
*  What would a Harris administration look like on that front?
*  Well, I think the Harris administration would continue a lot of the policy that we've seen
*  in the last two and a half years since Putin's full-scale invasion.
*  She is invested in that.
*  I actually met with Zelensky a few days before Russia invaded.
*  She's met with Zelensky now seven times, including the meeting they had together late last week.
*  And so whatever she might have thought about it coming in, she's very much a part of the
*  Biden policy and is unlikely to make large-scale shifts.
*  We brought 50 countries together to support Ukraine in its righteous defense.
*  She believes that Russia cannot be allowed to simply win because if Russia wins, it means
*  that the whole international rules-based order is out the window.
*  Because Putin's agenda is not just about Ukraine.
*  It means that a larger country can use force to rewrite the map without any regard to the
*  rules, without any regard to sovereignty and independence.
*  And in fact, she took a dig at Trump when she met with Zelensky, calling what he is
*  suggesting a proposal for surrender.
*  So very much continuing the Biden doctrine here on Ukraine, American leadership, convening
*  allies, NATO, and she does this dig at Trump.
*  Bring us to Trump.
*  How would he be different?
*  I think he'd be vastly different.
*  It's very hard to see any foreign policy issue that would be more 180-degree flip.
*  I will have that war settled in one day, 24 hours.
*  How would you settle that war in one day?
*  He has said that he would end the war in 24 hours.
*  Now how he would do that, he doesn't exactly say.
*  You can break that deal.
*  100 percent, it would be easy.
*  That deal would be easy.
*  Not a single person I know who knows anything about Russia and Ukraine thinks is possible.
*  Right.
*  It's not realistic.
*  And B, it's just a complete and utter reversal of where the United States has traditionally
*  stood, which is you don't reward aggression, that you don't give in to international bullies.
*  Trump has spent so much time expressing admiration of Putin that people still wonder why they're
*  so close.
*  What is it about Putin that makes Trump so flattering?
*  He's not expressed any condemnation of the Russian war.
*  I want to ask you a very simple question tonight.
*  Do you want Ukraine to win this war?
*  And when he's asked, as he was at the debate, whether he wants Ukraine to win.
*  I want the war to stop.
*  I want to save lives.
*  He always ducks the question.
*  I don't think in terms of winning and losing.
*  So even last week, Welszlinski was visiting for the United Nations General Assembly.
*  He had a last minute meeting with Trump in New York.
*  And there again, Trump refused to condemn Russia for the war.
*  Instead, he suggested that Putin wants the war to end and refused to give any assurances
*  to Zelensky for American support.
*  But I guess the flip side of it is still kind of confusing to me, Peter.
*  Why do you think it is that Trump is like that on Ukraine?
*  Why is he so opposed to their war against Russia, which was obviously supported by old
*  school Republicans quite strongly?
*  It's America first, right?
*  That's his theory of international relations.
*  Unless he sees it as an immediate American benefit, he doesn't want to have anything
*  to do with it.
*  A lot of people would argue, of course, it is in America's interest to stop countries
*  from invading each other.
*  But he doesn't see it that way.
*  In his telling of it, we have no business being involved unless we get something out
*  of it.
*  Okay, so Peter, say Trump wins.
*  It's a Trump administration.
*  What does his approach to Ukraine actually look like in practice and what would be the
*  effect of it?
*  Well, first off, of course, there will probably not be any more American arms and American
*  aid.
*  At least Ukraine shouldn't count on that.
*  And I think that that by itself would be a dramatic change on the ground there.
*  American arms have been critical in helping Ukraine beat back a much stronger, much bigger
*  opponent, invader.
*  Now, in theory, Europe could fill the void, but there's weariness about the war in Europe
*  as well.
*  And it would be very challenging for European leaders to come up with even more money to
*  fill the gap if the United States withdraws.
*  And I assume if there's a Harris administration, she's also not necessarily going to have an
*  easy time getting a lot more money for Ukraine.
*  What about what she would actually do?
*  Would it be different than what Biden has done?
*  I think it would probably be roughly the same, but she will be presented with a different
*  set of circumstances than he was.
*  Biden was presented with the initial invasion.
*  She will be coming at it later in the progress of the war when there'll be more pressure
*  to find a resolution to get to some sort of a halt in the killing.
*  I think it's fair to assume she wouldn't make concessions that Ukraine doesn't agree to.
*  She would take her cues, presumably from Zelensky or the Ukrainian leadership.
*  Okay, so to recap, Ukraine, these candidates are quite different.
*  Israel, more complicated.
*  Are there areas where they're similar?
*  There's not a lot of similarity between these two when it comes to foreign policy.
*  But there is one area of the world where they actually kind of start from a similar point
*  of view.
*  And that's China.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Peter, tell me about the two candidates in China.
*  You said this is one area where they do actually overlap and maybe start with Trump here.
*  I remember him coming in in 2017 and saying he was really going to take China to task.
*  He was going to change things with China.
*  He did change things with China.
*  And I think he changed things in Washington with regard to China.
*  The old way of thinking about China in Washington had been if we bring them into the international
*  community, if we make them a member of the WTO, if we make them part of our globalized
*  system, they will moderate their behavior.
*  They will not be as big an aggressive threat on the international stage and maybe even
*  become more democratic at home.
*  Well, that theory failed.
*  And in its place, Trump created a new bipartisan consensus, which is that China is in fact
*  an adversary, not a friend.
*  That in fact, we are too dependent on China economically and that we ought to be more
*  skeptical of their leadership and their motivations and less assuming that we can make common
*  cause with them.
*  Now, how he approaches it is different than how the Democrats would approach it.
*  He launched really a trade war with China with massive tariffs and constantly attacking
*  their leadership.
*  But it was all very transactional.
*  It's all for him about economics, about intellectual property and trade and supply chains.
*  He didn't care at all about Taiwan and its perpetual conflict with China, which has always
*  been at the heart of our relationship with Beijing.
*  He didn't care about advances in the South China Sea or China's bullying of the Philippines
*  or other neighbors.
*  In fact, there's a really telling anecdote when he was president and he was going to
*  be talking with Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker,
*  who's been a long time China hawk.
*  Xi told him that he should raise the plight of the Uyghurs.
*  Those are the Muslim minority who are kept in camps in many cases in China, very repressed.
*  He did raise it with Xi and then tells Pelosi that, oh, it's okay.
*  Xi told me they like being in those camps.
*  They like being in those camps.
*  And Pelosi was astonished.
*  On what planet do people like being in camps?
*  And yet that's the way Trump saw it.
*  Oh, okay.
*  It's all fine.
*  What really he cared about was economics.
*  Interesting.
*  So Peter, what about Harris?
*  I mean, presumably, Xi does care about Uyghurs and democracy.
*  Tell me about how Xi would approach China.
*  I think Harris would come at it from the more traditional, mainly bipartisan approach, which
*  is less confrontational, less hostile in tone and positioning.
*  But you know, Xi, like Biden, is not going to back down on the economic measures that
*  Trump would have placed.
*  I mean, one of the things that Biden did was to keep the tariffs on China that he had criticized
*  as a candidate.
*  So he decided it was too politically costly or whatever to take them off.
*  But his approach, and I think hers would follow, has been more targeted since then.
*  They have doubled down on the semiconductor industry in the United States so that we are
*  making more of these computer chips that are central to everything in our economy rather
*  than relying quite so much on Taiwan in particular, but China as well.
*  And the sanctions that Biden has put in place on China have been more narrowly formulated
*  in his view to get at the things we care about most, not to actually break all ties with
*  China.
*  The phrase that his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, uses is we are de-risking,
*  not decoupling.
*  And what does that mean, Peter?
*  Well, we were trying to take away the risks of being too dependent on China, particularly
*  when it comes to supply chains.
*  Decoupling means we're completely cutting off.
*  We're no longer going to have this economic relationship.
*  And that's unrealistic as far as Biden is concerned.
*  I think that Harris shares that view.
*  So kind of a scalpel versus a hammer when it comes to trying to get tougher on China.
*  Exactly right.
*  But there's also the issue of Russia when it comes to China, right?
*  Our relationship with China has changed in the last three years since Trump left office
*  because of China's support for Russia's invasion in Ukraine.
*  And Russia and China have aligned themselves much more closely in the last few years.
*  And that's a very different challenge.
*  And remind listeners, Peter, what exactly China is doing for Russia there.
*  What's the importance of that relationship?
*  Well, China is propping Russia up economically right now, where the West has cut Russia off
*  with sanctions and so forth, where Western companies have fled Russia and taken their
*  money with them.
*  It has been China that has filled the gap.
*  China is buying Russian energy.
*  China is supporting Russia economically.
*  And the worry is that China at some point will supply weapons to them.
*  And China has become Russia's best friend.
*  And Peter, what would that mean for Trump if he won?
*  I mean, Trump, of course, as you're pointing out, so close to Putin, so admiring of Putin
*  and quite the opposite with China.
*  This is an interesting knot for him then.
*  It really is.
*  Ironically, of course, we'd have these three countries in effect led by strong leaders
*  who see the world in similar terms and how that would play out.
*  That's a really interesting question.
*  I don't know that we know the answer to that.
*  So Peter, I guess the thing that's really striking to me here is just how different
*  Trump is from his party, how much he's changed in a way on Russia, on China, even some ways
*  on Israel.
*  While Harris, in many ways, is very much the product of her party.
*  Is that the way this period in American foreign policy will be remembered?
*  Is that the key takeaway here?
*  Yeah, I think it's a very good way to put it, that he is changing his party and she
*  is a product of hers.
*  But it's really not so much about ideology.
*  It's not even really about Democrats and Republicans.
*  It's really about predictability and unpredictability.
*  In other words, Harris represents a much more stable way of looking at the world.
*  And other leaders have a much better sense of where she will come out of things.
*  And he's volatile and he's mercurial.
*  He threatens to leave NATO one minute and has to be talked into staying in the next.
*  That difference is the main difference between them, right?
*  And is there any argument for unpredictability as a deterrent?
*  We don't quite know where this guy's going to come out on whatever crazy thing we're
*  trying to do, so we maybe shouldn't try to do it?
*  Well that's certainly an argument here from Trump's side.
*  Absolutely.
*  The madman theory, if you will, of foreign policy.
*  Now Richard Nixon famously used this tactic.
*  He told Kissinger to tell foreign leaders that he, Nixon, was kind of crazy and therefore
*  they ought to do whatever Kissinger was asking because I have no idea if I can control the
*  boss.
*  In some ways Trump does the same thing.
*  But with Nixon it was a tactic.
*  With Trump it's just who he is, right?
*  He is in fact somebody who will decide on the spur of the moment to do something drastically
*  different on foreign policy without a big process and a committee meeting and so forth.
*  So traditionally of course America has preferred to have predictable and stable relations with
*  other countries.
*  But Trump is again, as always, the outlier who challenges that thinking.
*  On the other hand though, just to play this out, if Harris were to win, you know, then
*  there's something to be said about the fact that four more years of the same, or at least
*  a very similar foreign policy to Biden, might also be problematic considering that all of
*  these wars that we find ourselves pretty closely related to and very difficult to find our
*  way out of.
*  Yeah, sure.
*  Of course, the argument is that traditional foreign policy hasn't worked well enough,
*  right?
*  That we are in these terrible crises in Europe and the Middle East and what has our diplomacy
*  gotten us?
*  Now, it's hard to argue a counterfactual.
*  Would it be worse if X than Y?
*  But in a world where you have adversaries who have nuclear weapons, the argument from
*  the Biden side is better to keep things from boiling over in a much worse way.
*  Maybe, you know, a Trumpian unpredictability is a deterrent on some level, but it's better
*  from their point of view anyway to have predictability because outcomes could be a whole lot worse.
*  Peter, what do you think this unpredictability does to American power and America's place
*  in the world?
*  Well, it's a really good question because in fact, it used to be that the United States
*  was the reliable actor.
*  You pretty much knew where the United States was going to fall on major issues in the world.
*  Other countries responded accordingly.
*  Didn't mean that everybody did what the United States wanted them to do by any stretch, but
*  that that predictability, that reliability was central to at least a broad sense of order
*  in the world.
*  What you hear now from foreign officials is we don't know whether you guys are going to
*  be there or not.
*  They're like, OK, is Trump the aberration or is Biden the aberration?
*  Which one stands for where America really plans to be from now on?
*  Will the real America please stand up?
*  We'll know a lot more come November.
*  Peter, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Sunday, Israel launched long distance airstrikes in Yemen targeting shipping and power supplies
*  of the Houthis, another group backed by Iran that has attacked Israel over the past year.
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the show of force against multiple enemies at
*  once was part of a broader strategy to create a new balance of power in the Middle East.
*  A spokesman for the Biden administration reiterated that the White House wants a diplomatic solution
*  rather than an all out war.
*  And very serious situation in the South, the catastrophic aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
*  Millions of people are still without power.
*  Whole communities have been flattened.
*  Over the weekend, search and rescue efforts started in the South as more than six states
*  reeled from the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
*  Conditions are now safe enough in multiple states for officials to start surveying the
*  damage.
*  And what they are seeing in terms of Helene's wrath is horrifying.
*  So many communities in the Carolina mountains are now essentially cut off by road.
*  There are much needed supplies that are being flown in.
*  In the same time.
*  The storm, which made landfall along Florida's Big Bend region, carried strong winds and
*  heavy rain far inland, wreaking havoc in mostly rural areas in Tennessee, Georgia, South and
*  North Carolina and Virginia.
*  I don't think anyone was prepared for it.
*  I don't think anyone thought it would be this bad.
*  There's probably 50 trees blocking my neighbor from coming out.
*  I started helping them yesterday.
*  The neighbors at the other end of the road, we got us out, but the other neighbors are trapped.
*  As of Sunday afternoon, the death toll from the storm totaled more than 90 people.
*  But officials said to expect that number to rise as they reached residents who were stranded
*  at their homes or were still unaccounted for.
