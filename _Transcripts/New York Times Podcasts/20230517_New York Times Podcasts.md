# Turkey’s President Fights for Political Survival
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c8_pgO-I10)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Skyrocketing inflation and a devastating earthquake left Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan
*  vulnerable at the ballot box for the first time in his 20 years in power.
*  In an election over the weekend, he was forced to a runoff, the first in Turkey's history.
*  Today, my colleague Ben Hubbard, on Erdogan's fight for political survival and what it says
*  about democracy in Turkey.
*  It's Wednesday, May 17th.
*  So Ben, Turkey just had an election over the weekend where the country's leader, Recep
*  Tayyip Erdogan, failed to clear the hurdle to win outright.
*  And now the country's headed to a runoff.
*  Let's understand what this means.
*  This was really a remarkable moment in modern Turkish history and in the history of Erdogan,
*  who has been by far the dominant politician on the national stage here for the last 20
*  years.
*  Going into the vote on Sunday, he was down in the polls, which he has never been before,
*  and he went into the election and he lost support in districts across the country, had
*  fewer people voting for him, and he failed to get more than 50% of the vote, which would
*  have automatically given him a third presidential term.
*  But if you look at this another way, it's not a setback at all.
*  He's still in this race.
*  And this is really the latest chapter in the longer Erdogan story, which is one of a politician
*  of incredible talents who has just repeatedly, against the odds, managed to keep himself
*  on top.
*  Right.
*  He had toured Turkey for four years, and I just remember Erdogan as this astute, savvy
*  force that was just absolutely dominant in Turkish politics.
*  So let's talk about that then.
*  Where does the story of Erdogan as political survivor begin?
*  Before Erdogan came along, Turkish politics tended to be dominated by elites in the big
*  cities, very much steeped in this idea that even though it's a Muslim majority society,
*  that it was a staunchly secular place.
*  But Erdogan comes up on a completely different track.
*  He's not from the elite.
*  He grew up in a poor, tough neighborhood in Istanbul.
*  He attended religious schools, which at the time were supposed to be only for people who
*  wanted to become preachers and serve in other religious functions.
*  And then he got into politics.
*  He serves a stint as the mayor of Istanbul in the 90s and is celebrated all around.
*  People give him a lot of credit for organizing what was otherwise a polluted and messy, gigantic
*  metropolis.
*  And then he gets his first shot at the national stage.
*  In 2002, his party, which he had just helped found, comes out of nowhere and wins the majority
*  in the parliament.
*  And this is basically a protest vote by Turks who were so angry at the way that the previous
*  parties had been running the country that they decided to give these guys a chance.
*  And the year after that, 2003, Erdogan is able to get himself into parliament and promptly
*  becomes the prime minister.
*  So he comes in and all of a sudden he's basically in charge of the government.
*  And the country has really never seen anything like this.
*  He's a scrappy underdog.
*  He's largely representative of a large religious underclass in the country, people who tend
*  to be devout, who felt for a long time like they were looked down upon by the urban elites.
*  We're talking about the poorer parts of society and they rally around him and they see him
*  as their champion.
*  And then Turkey really takes off.
*  During his first decade as the prime minister, Turkey's GDP more than tripled.
*  He went about a building spree basically where new neighborhoods, new areas, new homes cropped
*  up across the country.
*  They built new hospitals, they built airports in lots of the regional cities, highways,
*  rail lines.
*  And so for people living in Turkey, the country really goes from a place where a lot of people
*  are poor and don't have great services to a place where a lot of people are middle class
*  and can really take advantage of it.
*  People are buying homes, they're buying cars, they're earning more money.
*  And so he was tremendously popular for that and voters continue to reward him and his
*  party at the ballot box.
*  I mean, this was a revolution in Turkish politics.
*  I mean, this was not typical for a Turkish leader and people really loved him for it.
*  That's right.
*  But then after his first decade in power, the sheen starts to come off.
*  We enter sort of a new chapter in the history of Erdogan where we really see new efforts
*  to squeeze any kind of dissent or opposition to his rule to consolidate his control over
*  the states.
*  This starts with pressure on journalists, pressure on the opposition, efforts to modify
*  the government.
*  And these really gets turbocharged after an attempted coup against him in 2016.
*  The Turkish military says in a statement that it has taken control of the country and imposed
*  martial law.
*  It's carried out by a religious group that had previously been close allies and people
*  in the military and they literally try to overthrow the government.
*  Erdogan is at a vacation retreat.
*  They send commandos in to try to kidnap him.
*  He gets wind of it and gets out of there before they arrive.
*  I mean, it's like something out of an action movie.
*  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan speaking to the country via a FaceTime call into CNN
*  Turk, telling his supporters to go to the streets to fight for democracy.
*  But then he survives.
*  The attempted coup on the Turkish government is seen to have increased public backing for
*  the president with several thousand people in Istanbul rallying in his support.
*  And he really takes advantage of this coup and uses it to further consolidate his power.
*  Altogether more than 50,000 people have either been sacked or suspended since the coup attempt,
*  including police, judges, soldiers and generals.
*  Tens of thousands of people are arrested, are purged from their jobs in the government
*  bureaucracy and the judiciary and other parts of the state.
*  The education ministry suspended over 15,000 personnel.
*  We can make comparison between the Makart era and Turkey right now.
*  And many of these people are replaced by loyalists, by people who belong to his party.
*  And that gives him even more sway over the government.
*  And mark this the day that Turkey changed forever.
*  Thousands celebrate a new constitution.
*  In 2017, he backs a referendum that passes by a slim margin, but passes.
*  It would completely change the political system here from a parliamentary to a presidential republic.
*  Mr Erdogan would have vastly enhanced powers.
*  The prime minister would be scrapped.
*  And of course, he at the time is the president.
*  So while his own allies say this is just like an American or a French or a South Korean
*  presidential system, in fact, it's not really.
*  He can, for instance, appoint the majority of the main judges, 12 out of 15.
*  And so this gives him even more powers than he had before.
*  And he takes those powers and uses them to give himself even more powers.
*  And so this is really when we head into the area where people start worrying about the
*  health of Turkish democracy and wondering how far is it going to tip from democracy
*  towards authoritarianism?
*  And is he really out to establish a system of one man rule?
*  And of course, all along the way, he's still winning open elections, right?
*  And handily.
*  And this is the challenge.
*  And frankly, this is what he and his supporters will always say is like, why are you talking
*  about autocracy?
*  The guy keeps winning elections.
*  Right.
*  I mean, in the most recent presidential elections before this one in 2018, he won in the first
*  round with about 52 percent.
*  His nearest challenger was more than 20 points behind him.
*  So his defenders will say, what are you complaining about?
*  The people have spoken and they have chosen Erdogan yet again.
*  So why are you complaining?
*  Exactly.
*  And in the same year, Erdogan faces a new threat that really strikes directly at his
*  popularity among voters.
*  Turkey's central bank has confirmed what consumers have already learned the hard way.
*  It's predicting inflation will hit a 15 year high this year.
*  The currency starts losing its value and prices start to go up.
*  Food prices shot up by 34 percent in the third quarter and all the money spent on essentials
*  And that means basically that people's money is not worth what it used to be worth.
*  They can't buy the same things that they used to buy.
*  Their salaries are just worth less.
*  And in one sense, this is very much the culmination of these years of economic policy of massive
*  government spending, lots of it built on debt.
*  And these were policies that he championed and that he was largely in charge of.
*  Right.
*  As we talked about earlier, he pursued the single minded approach to the economy, which
*  kind of amounted to pouring sugar water into it.
*  Like it was intended for rapid growth, which he succeeded at.
*  But at some point, as we all know, when the sugar runs out, you get a headache.
*  This is very much the end of the sugar high.
*  Prices keep going up and they keep going up.
*  And Erdogan basically makes it worse.
*  Erdogan calls himself an enemy of interest rates.
*  He says they lead to inflation, though the opposite has been proven true.
*  Most economists will tell you that if you have an inflation problem, the first thing
*  that you should do is raise interest rates to try to cool off the economy.
*  He does exactly the opposite and he starts reducing them.
*  He reduces interest rates.
*  Yes, repeatedly.
*  Man, when are we going to be wise?
*  You can control the interest rates, but you cannot control inflation.
*  Inflation occurs as a result of your wrong steps.
*  And who pays the price?
*  Our people above all.
*  At the same time, he is sort of burning through central bank chiefs.
*  He numerous times fires the central bank chief and brings in somebody else.
*  Turkey's president Erdogan shook markets again by replacing the head of his central bank
*  again, this time after just four months on the job.
*  And through that process, we really see that, you know, he's in charge.
*  He's running the show.
*  He's the one who's setting the policy.
*  Mr. Ahmet's successor, Shahab Kabcoglu, falls more in line with President Erdogan's unorthodox
*  thinking about interest rates and inflation.
*  This builds and builds and builds until late last year when inflation shoots above 80 percent.
*  Wow.
*  Inflation in Turkey jumped to a 24 year high one week after the central bank cut interest
*  rates again.
*  I mean, by comparison, the US peak was 9 percent last year.
*  I mean, 80 percent is just unbelievable.
*  This agency, however, an independent inflation research group, claims that the actual rate
*  stands at a whopping 186 percent.
*  The lira is in freefall as the country reckons with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's unorthodox
*  economic approach, which is contrary to widely accepted inflationary wisdom.
*  I mean, how do you even go to the grocery store and plan a grocery list?
*  It really undermines sort of anybody on any kind of a fixed income, whether you're retired
*  and you're getting a pension, whether you're a teacher, whether you're a bus driver.
*  Turkey is an economic turmoil.
*  People are queuing for bread, cutting back on meat and are even fleeing to other countries.
*  Prices are high.
*  We're really struggling.
*  We have two children who go to school.
*  We are only earning minimum wage and it's hard to make a living.
*  You're just basically watching your salary effectively get smaller and smaller and smaller
*  and every time you go to the grocery store, you see that the price is for onions or tomatoes
*  or pasta or rice or anything that you might want to buy just sort of going off the charts.
*  And so it changes the way that people eat.
*  It changes the kind of trips that they take.
*  It changes how much they drive because people just have to cut things out of their budget
*  that they can't afford anymore.
*  You know, this is the definition of a pocketbook issue and it's really just hitting people
*  all the way across the country.
*  I don't see a future here.
*  I actually want to go abroad.
*  This is true for most of us.
*  And that really opens up a new possibility for something unusual to happen.
*  So in the lead up to this year's presidential election, we have the historically fractured
*  Turkish opposition, Koalas.
*  And they come together, a group of six opposition parties whose ideologies are quite diverse
*  and there's many things they don't agree on.
*  They come together as a coalition and back a common presidential candidate.
*  So as we get into this year, we're in this very unique position where we have people
*  suffering because of the economy.
*  We have a united Turkish opposition.
*  And so Erdogan starts heading towards this election facing a political threat in the
*  one place that he's always been strongest, which is at the ballot box.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Ben, tell me about this opposition coalition and the candidate they decided to back.
*  Who is he and what is his pitch to Turkish voters?
*  So the coalition has come together behind a man named Kemal Kalicitaroğlu.
*  He is the head of the largest opposition party that the coalition has sort of built
*  around and he's a former civil servant.
*  Basically worked his entire career in the government and his last job was running the
*  equivalent of the Social Security Administration.
*  And what's he like?
*  I mean, what's his pitch?
*  He's almost the polar opposite of Erdogan.
*  He's someone who seemed to be somewhat quiet, somewhat reasonable in his way of discussing
*  very modest in how he presents himself to voters.
*  I mean, I think the biggest indication of this are these videos that he's released throughout
*  the campaign of him sitting in his kitchen.
*  It's a very modest Turkish kitchen, like you would see, you know, in most middle class
*  families somewhat old fashioned.
*  There's some tea towels hanging behind him on the oven.
*  People noticed in one of the recent videos that it looks like he had bought a new air
*  fryer and he literally just sits at the table and talks about stuff.
*  He did one recently where he had an onion as a prop.
*  An onion?
*  Yeah, he held up the onion, which people use often in their cooking and talked about how
*  expensive they had become to go after Erdogan and his party and really hit them hard with
*  this inflation problem.
*  And he says, look, this is our actual agenda.
*  They know that when I come to power, democracy will come, money will flow and your purchasing
*  power will increase.
*  They have no shame.
*  So Erdogan is in this very unfamiliar situation, right?
*  Where he's facing a real opposition that has a serious chance of beating him.
*  So what does he do?
*  He goes on the attack.
*  He runs a very aggressive campaign against Kılıçdaroğlu.
*  He many times appears quite angry in his public appearances.
*  He belittles him.
*  He at one point refers to him as a drunkard.
*  A drunkard?
*  Well, as a kind of a way to code to more religious voters that this guy is secular and so he's
*  not the kind of person that you're looking for.
*  He's not from the religious class that we are type thing.
*  Right.
*  It's very much a code for he's not one of us or sort of the religious parts of society.
*  And he tries to create this general image of this is somebody who is incompetent and
*  incapable and weak.
*  And if you elect him as your president, Turkey's going to be in a lot of trouble.
*  So that's what he says.
*  What does he do during the campaign, Ben?
*  At the same time, he basically taps this tremendous power that he has as the president in this
*  powerful presidential system and uses the resources of the state to boost his chances
*  in the campaign.
*  And so he three times in the last year and a half has raised the minimum wage.
*  He raises pay for civil servants.
*  He changes some of the regulations about pensions to allow millions of Turks to get their pension
*  early.
*  So weeks ago, we were in one of the medium sized towns in the middle of the country and
*  we met a guy who's so excited because he's about to get his pension at age 46.
*  Wow.
*  And that's all because of these regulations that Erdogan has changed.
*  His ability to do these things is so unchecked that he can just basically open the tap of
*  public spending and pour money onto these people to protect them in the short term from
*  the very painful effects of this inflation that we've been talking about.
*  But in the long term, the bills are eventually going to come due and somebody's going to
*  have to figure out how to cover them.
*  I mean, it sounds almost like he's bribing people to vote for him.
*  Well that's certainly what his opponents would say.
*  And all of this is building towards last weekend when we had the election.
*  And what an election.
*  It was such a nail biter.
*  I mean, I was watching it all day thinking, oh my God, what's going to happen?
*  And it was so close.
*  It was incredibly close.
*  First thing, we had tremendous turnout.
*  The participation rate was close to 90%.
*  Just off the charts, huge, huge numbers of people went out to vote.
*  So at the polling places, you just saw long lines.
*  You saw people excited about their particular candidates, waving flags, wearing t-shirts,
*  all really excited to be participating in this political act.
*  And the polls close and we finally get the results, which is that Erdogan doesn't get
*  it across the line.
*  He ends up with 49.5%.
*  So a half percent short of an outright victory.
*  Kalich Taroly comes through with 44.9%.
*  So trailing his challenger.
*  And what do you make of those results?
*  Well the immediate effect is that we're going to go to a runoff.
*  On May 28th, the top two contenders, Erdogan and Kalich Taroly, are going to face off to
*  determine who finally wins.
*  What's interesting here is that Erdogan is actually in a very strong position.
*  There was a third candidate in the race who got about 5.2% of the vote.
*  He's eliminated.
*  And most of his voters are likely to vote for Erdogan in the second round, which could
*  be enough to give him the victory.
*  And I think everybody got a sense of where this seemed to be heading the night of after
*  the results had come in.
*  In the middle of the night, Erdogan appears on the balcony and it's dark out and he's
*  wearing this long black coat and he has crowds of people beneath him who've been waiting
*  to see if he's going to win the election.
*  And he comes out standing straight up looking very confident and he addresses them and he
*  basically says,
*  We love you a lot.
*  This here is the result of that love.
*  In a barbed sort of jab at his opponent, he says, some are in the kitchen, we are on the balcony.
*  And he says, while the final results are not clear yet, we are ahead by far.
*  And that seemed to show that he was confident that he was going to win.
*  So there you have it.
*  An unbelievable story of political survival, right?
*  I mean, years of economic turmoil, 80% inflation.
*  Like that would spell the end for pretty much any political leader's career in a democracy,
*  but not his.
*  How do you explain that?
*  Turkey is a very complicated place.
*  This is a country that people will tell you is not fully a democracy and is not fully
*  an autocracy.
*  It's a hybrid.
*  It's somewhere in this murky middle that has characteristics of both systems.
*  And because of the way this election was run, it was free.
*  But because of the way that Erdogan was able to use his power to tilt the playing field
*  in his direction beforehand, it was not really fair.
*  So free, but not so fair.
*  Yes, that's right.
*  So that leaves us in a situation where he's still the survivor.
*  He's managed to do it yet again, and he's in a very good position going into this runoff
*  on May 28th.
*  And if he wins there, he's going to have five more years to leave his mark on Turkey.
*  Ben, thank you.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Tuesday, a high stakes meeting between President Biden and congressional leaders
*  over the debt limit ended with leaders saying that both sides were still, quote, far apart.
*  If the debt ceiling is not lifted, the government could run out of money by June 1st.
*  But the meeting was not without some progress.
*  Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy told reporters that it might be possible to reach a deal
*  by the end of the week.
*  And in North Carolina, legislation banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy
*  will become law after the state's Republican-controlled House successfully overrode the veto of the
*  Democratic governor.
*  The override, which was completed Tuesday night, was possible because a Democrat, Trisha
*  Cougham, switched parties, giving Republicans the three-fifths majority needed to succeed.
*  Until now, North Carolina had allowed abortions up to 20 weeks and had become a destination
*  in the South for women seeking abortions after Roe fell last year.
