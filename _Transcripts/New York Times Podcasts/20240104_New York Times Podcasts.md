# Why Are So Many More Pedestrians Dying in the U.S.?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m99ecBUmcU)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  A puzzling new pattern has taken hold on American roads.
*  Pedestrian traffic deaths, which had been on the decline for years, have skyrocketed.
*  Today, my colleague Emily Badger, on her investigation into why.
*  It's Thursday, January 4th.
*  So Emily, you spent months investigating a very surprising trend, and that is pedestrian
*  deaths after decades of declines are now rising.
*  So we wanted to talk to you about that investigation and really look closely at this question of why.
*  But before we get there, tell me how you came to this story.
*  Where'd you begin?
*  So I write about urban policy for the Times, which means I write about transportation,
*  among other things, and sort of how people use it and how we get around and how important it is to
*  our lives. And this one very apparent pattern keeps coming up over and over again, which is
*  that there has been this traffic safety crisis in America affecting, in particular, pedestrians.
*  For years and years, throughout the 80s, the 90s, the early 2000s, roads in America were becoming
*  safer and safer for pedestrians. And then something changes around 2009. All of a sudden,
*  roads start to become more dangerous year over year, to the point where more than 3,000 additional
*  pedestrians died in 2021 compared to 2009. And it's this incredible mystery for a number of reasons.
*  One of them is that we don't see anything like this in other industrialized countries.
*  We don't see pedestrian deaths rising. If anything, they're falling in other countries.
*  So in this mystery, there's something particular to the United States going on.
*  There's something that starts around 2009 going on. And figuring out exactly what that is, is not
*  incredibly obvious. Even transportation researchers and regulators and engineers don't entirely know
*  what's going on here. So, Emily, what did you do? How did you try to solve this mystery in your
*  reporting? So I worked on this project alongside a colleague of mine, Ben Blatt. But he spent a lot of
*  time looking at federal fatality data in the United States. The federal government records a lot of
*  data every time someone dies on American roadways. We know about what kind of car was involved in the
*  collision. How old was the driver? How old was the person who was killed? What time of day did this
*  happen? And Ben discovers, looking through this data, so many of these deaths that are happening
*  among pedestrians in the United States are happening at night. And in fact, the vast,
*  vast majority of the rise in pedestrian fatalities in America that starts around 2009 is occurring
*  when it's dark out after sunset. So you're saying the overall increase is entirely because of these
*  nighttime deaths. That is what's driving the change. About 85% of the rise in pedestrian fatalities
*  in America since 2009 is entirely attributable to pedestrians dying in the darkness. And so Ben and I
*  set off to try to solve this incredibly difficult puzzle. I mean, it is basically like a three-sided
*  Rubik's Cube where we're trying to find answers that fit three different criteria. What is something
*  that starts around 2009? What is something that is particular to the United States that doesn't show
*  up in other countries? And what is something that would explain effects that are worse at night than
*  during the daytime? Okay, so let's dig into that. What did you start to find? So Ben and I go out and
*  we start collecting lots of very different theories about what could be contributing to this problem.
*  And let's start with maybe the most obvious one, smartphones. This timeline lines up fairly well
*  with the rise of the smartphone in America. Apple introduces the iPhone in 2007. It very rapidly
*  becomes ubiquitous and smartphones introduce new kinds of distraction into cars. And they're also
*  becoming ubiquitous at the same time as there is just this general proliferation of technology
*  inside of vehicles. It used to just be that you had four or five dials that you could manipulate
*  by touch that you had memorized. This is the one that controls temperature and this is the one that
*  controls the radio and you didn't have to look at them. And now you have to do five different
*  touchscreens and five different buttons to try to figure out how to turn the heat up.
*  Yeah, and effectively we have something like a smartphone writ large attached to the inside of
*  the car in addition to the one in your hand. And so that's potentially introducing distraction as well.
*  But other countries have smartphones and have stuff on the dashboard like that too. So why
*  would it be different in the U.S.? Right, so then we have to start thinking about it a little bit
*  harder. And it's like, is there something about smartphones that suggests that they're being used
*  differently by drivers in America than in other parts of the world? And we encounter some evidence
*  that I think that this is true. And this appears in some data that tracks how drivers actually use
*  their phones, whether or not they're picking them up, touching them, tapping them, moving around
*  while they're in moving cars. And it appears that American drivers are doing this more than they are
*  in other countries. But there's also sort of one other factor and this is probably my favorite
*  thing that I learned in the course of reporting on this, which is that if you think about the kinds
*  of cars that we drive in America, overwhelmingly almost all of us drive automatic transmission
*  vehicles. And these are cars that require kind of one hand to drive on the steering wheel
*  and the second hand for much of your time. Many people can do other things with it, including
*  picking up a smartphone. But this is not true in many pure countries that we would compare
*  the United States to. In most of Europe, manual transmissions are far, far, far more common.
*  And a manual transmission vehicle is a vehicle that takes two hands to drive. So even if there
*  weren't cultural differences and expectations around whether or not it's okay to use your
*  smartphone while you're driving, you literally cannot use your smartphone while you're driving
*  as much in many parts of the world where everyone is driving a stick shift.
*  Right. Because physically it's pretty difficult.
*  Yeah. And just to put this in perspective, the share of cars sold in America this year that have
*  a stick shift is about 1%. Wow.
*  The share of cars on the road in Europe that have a stick shift is 70 to 75%. So the vast majority
*  of cars on the road in Europe are stick shifts. The vast majority of them in America are not.
*  Interesting. Okay. So that's a big and very compelling theory. But what about the
*  nighttime question though, Emily? I mean, do most people use their phones distractedly when they're
*  behind the wheel actually at night? Yeah. So this is another part of the puzzle
*  that we have to think a little bit harder about. It's not like people are only using them once the
*  sun sets. But we have a reason to think that people use them more in the nighttime. And we
*  came across some data from a company that actually tracks how people are touching and manipulating
*  their phones while they're driving. And their data suggests that distracted driving is most common
*  in the evening time. Interesting. Why?
*  I mean, I think that's sort of consistent with the idea that you get off of work and now is when
*  you're coordinating with your significant other about who's going to pick up the kids or go to
*  the grocery store or with your friends who you're making plans to meet at a bar. There's sort of
*  social activity and coordination and communication. And another theory that someone gave me was that
*  this is also when a lot of people, particularly in the United States, are responding to after
*  hours work messages. We have this kind of uniquely American, always on work culture that says that
*  when your workday ends, you're still responsible for paying attention to work and responding to
*  things. And this is a small thing. I don't want to suggest that this is the overarching thing that
*  explains all of this, but it's a small cultural thing that is different in the United States from
*  other countries that we would compare ourselves to. Right. Okay. So phone use checks a lot of
*  these boxes, right? America's different in this way. There's a nighttime reason for it. And it
*  coincides with the year that the trend really took off, 2009. What else did you find in your quest to
*  solve this mystery? So I think another big obvious thing that
*  happens over the same time period is that American cars are getting bigger. And these
*  bigger cars have higher hoods. And a higher hood smashes into a pedestrian, not at the legs,
*  but at the chest, at the torso, at the head in these more deadly pain points. And it's also the
*  case that bigger, heavier cars brake slower. So if someone driving one of these cars sees a
*  pedestrian getting ready to cross the street and they hit the brakes, that car may still collide
*  with that pedestrian. And researchers will tell you that a large part of the reason why
*  the overall fatality rates in the United States are so much higher than they are in other countries
*  has to do among other things with the fact that the vehicles that we drive here are so big.
*  But I guess I sort of thought, Emily, that American cars had always been big. I mean,
*  I remember going to Europe for the first time and thinking all the cars there looked like little
*  sneakers or skateboards or something, you know, that American cars were so much bigger forever.
*  Yeah. So if we come back to our three-sided Rubik's Cube, like this is one element where
*  cars getting bigger doesn't quite fit our puzzle. It's part of the picture, but it's probably not
*  the central most important theory involved here, because this is not something that starts in 2009.
*  I mean, Americans were driving SUVs back in the 90s. And it's also clear to us when we look at
*  this federal fatality data, you know, smaller cars, sedans, they are killing more pedestrians
*  today than they did 15 years ago. So it's not just that there are fewer smaller cars, even smaller
*  cars are killing more pedestrians now. Interesting. And if we really believed it was the case that most
*  of this change over the last 15 years is driven by cars getting bigger, then we would think that
*  fatalities would be rising during the daytime too, right? Right. Like a Ford 150 pickup truck is just
*  as deadly at noon as it is at 10pm. Right. So now we have to start thinking about if the cars
*  themselves don't explain this puzzle, if the behavior of drivers alone can't explain all of
*  this puzzle. Now Ben and I are starting to think what is happening outside of vehicles? What's
*  happening in the country around cars that's contributing to this problem?
*  We'll be right back.
*  Okay. So Emily, you and Ben keep going. You look beyond the car, beyond the driver into the world
*  outside. What do you find? Yeah. So there may be other things happening in the country over this
*  time that would mean that more pedestrians are in situations where they might be exposed to a deadly
*  crash. So these are the sort of exposure theories. Okay. So explain that and give me an example.
*  Yeah. So one theory points to this kind of broader demographic trend. Americans have been moving
*  toward sunbelt parts of the country, you know, toward warmer parts of the country, metropolitan
*  areas in Texas, in Florida. And these are places that happen to have historically very bad pedestrian
*  safety records. And why is that? So these are parts of the country that developed much more recently
*  than New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago. They developed in the auto age after cars became
*  ubiquitous and they're fundamentally built around cars. They don't have strong transit networks.
*  They don't have a lot of pedestrian infrastructure. They're built around the assumption that everyone
*  drives everywhere they go. And maybe there are very few crosswalks or stoplights. There are a lot of
*  high speed arterial roads. These are these really wide high speed roads that still occasionally have
*  stoplights in the middle of them. And these are the kind of place where if you're a pedestrian
*  and you want to cross the street, maybe you have to walk half a mile up the road to be able to do
*  that. You know, that type of development is extremely common in these parts of the country
*  where people have increasingly been moving. Okay. So in other words, exposure to danger is higher
*  in a place that's built around the car, not the walking person. And as more people move to places
*  like this and the sunbelt is one of those places, then more people are actually exposed to that
*  danger. That's the theory. And just to give you an example, Florida especially really pops out in
*  this data. And over this time period that we've been talking about since 2009, pedestrian deaths
*  there are up by about 70%. Wow. 70%. Yeah. And you know, that's not totally surprising when you think
*  about the fact that to come back again to the parts of the country that have really been booming
*  in population. I'm thinking of places like Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, Daytona Beach. Like these
*  are places that rank in the top 10 of the most dangerous for pedestrian safety at the same time.
*  Right. But you know, these are also places that I'm sure you know, as a demographics reporter,
*  and I know as a former one are big for retirees. So does aging have to do with the trend at all?
*  Yeah, this is another demographic story that's happening in the background in America over this
*  time period that we're talking about. I mean, the American population is just getting older. But what
*  we see here is actually that it's not older people who are really driving this trend. It's more working
*  age people. It's people, you know, aged 18 to 64 or so. Okay. So what else are you seeing, Emily?
*  So another big shift that's happening in many American cities over part of this time is that
*  homelessness is rising. And with homelessness, we are literally talking about extremely vulnerable
*  people living adjacent roads, living in highway interchanges in underpasses of major roads.
*  And this is a theory that fits another part of our puzzle in that these are people who are present
*  on roads at night. But homelessness in America really sort of starts to rise in many cities around
*  2016 or so. So this isn't a story that begins way back in 2009, or that has some abrupt sort of change
*  in trajectory around that time period. But it is very clear in recent data just over the last few
*  years, that very large numbers of pedestrians who are killed in some cities have been homeless. You
*  know, just to give you one example, in Los Angeles, when I look at their pedestrian fatality data there,
*  it looks like about 30% of their deaths recently have been among homeless people. Wow. So that
*  means that this has to be at least part of what's going on here. So Emily, you're talking about people
*  being on dangerous roads at times when it's dark out. And you know, I remember when I was a national
*  reporter, I started to notice that low income people were actually moving out of expensive inner
*  cities into much less expensive suburbs. And that many of those people I was interviewing and I was
*  going to report on couldn't afford cars. And they'd actually be walking down the street early in the
*  morning when it's dark out to go to work. And the street wouldn't be just a little country road, it
*  would be a major highway. Is that part of what's going on here too? I think that has absolutely got
*  to be part of the story as well. I mean, here, what we're talking about is this national trend of the
*  suburbanization of poverty, lower income people moving into suburban environments, which very
*  similar to the sunbelt environments we were just talking about. These are places that have very few
*  crosswalks. They often have no sidewalks at all. And we're talking about people moving into those
*  environments who, you know, they may be doing shift work, working odd hours, they may be relying
*  on buses that come in frequently. And that is potentially increasing exposure as well of people
*  who are likely to be out on the most dangerous roads in circumstances where they may be hit by
*  a car. In Portland, Oregon, for example, there are these notoriously dangerous arterial roads
*  on the eastern side of the city, where historically pedestrian infrastructure has been really lacking.
*  And over the last decade or so, this is where people who have been priced out of more expensive
*  neighborhoods in Portland have been moving to. And there's research that sort of suggests that
*  this kind of pattern that I've just described in Portland is apparent more nationally. And it
*  appears as if pedestrian fatalities are actually declining in downtowns and where they're rising
*  is in suburban environments like the one I've just described. So this suggests actually that
*  the people who are being killed are probably some of the most vulnerable in American society.
*  Low income people walking to work along a highway in the middle of the night going to a shift
*  can't afford a car and homeless people. Yeah, I think that's absolutely true. I mean,
*  the federal fatality data that we're looking at here doesn't tell us, for instance, what's the
*  income of the person who died. But there's other research that suggests that these kind of fatality
*  hotspots, these most dangerous roads are disproportionately occurring in low income neighborhoods.
*  And that means that this problem falls the heaviest on the most disadvantaged people.
*  Emily, looking back on everything that you found, would you say that you've solved the mystery?
*  I don't think we solved the mystery in the sense that we didn't uncover one obvious thing that
*  explains all of this problem. I think the best possible explanation is that multiple things have
*  been happening over the same time. And those things are interacting with each other, they're
*  amplifying each other, darkness makes all of them worse. And I think where Ben and I really land in
*  thinking about this is that we have this fundamentally risky transportation infrastructure
*  in the United States. You know, we had this very clear example of this during the pandemic where
*  many fewer people were driving, there were far fewer cars on the road. This was true all over
*  the world. And in most countries, fatalities declined because fewer people were on the road.
*  And you would think that the same thing would have happened in the United States, but it didn't. The
*  opposite happened. Fewer people were driving and still more people were dying. More people were
*  dying in all kinds of traffic fatalities, including pedestrians. Why? I think that gets back to the
*  same sort of underlying idea here. You know, during the pandemic, you take a lot of the cars
*  off the road, you take a lot of the people away from the picture, and you can see really crystal
*  clear what's left. It's this transportation system that we've built that is designed for speed. And
*  all of a sudden, when there were fewer cars on the road, the drivers who remained felt very
*  comfortable driving fast, driving recklessly, and that had these deadly consequences. Interesting.
*  So what does that mean, Emily? What do you take away from that? I mean, I think this tells us that
*  our system is not designed to protect pedestrians. It's not designed to prioritize safety.
*  And thinking about this, the story really touched a nerve with a lot of our readers. I mean, I heard
*  from hundreds of them, and many of them had their own theories, which are things that we didn't even
*  touch on here. But some of them also told me, I think it's about pedestrian behavior. Pedestrians
*  don't look both ways before crossing the street, like they used to in the olden days. They no longer
*  wear light colors at night. They're looking down at their phones, and they're bringing this risk
*  on themselves. And I think the reality is that if we look at other countries, they are producing
*  much safer outcomes. And they're not doing it by taking pedestrian cell phones away or making
*  pedestrians wear reflective gear or spending a lot of money on public service campaigns that are
*  teaching pedestrians how to avoid being hit by cars. They're doing it by fundamentally investing
*  in how they design safe roads and making a fundamental commitment in their laws and in
*  their regulations to prioritizing safety over cars traveling as fast as possible. And what does that
*  mean about the U.S. and what's happening here? So what that means here is that if we want to see
*  fewer pedestrian fatalities, we need to do those same things. We need to be changing our roads to
*  make them safer. We need to be telling drivers that if you're running through red lights, the
*  penalties for that are real, that we care about safety. But in order for us to do those kinds of
*  things, that requires a big cultural change to how we have thought about and designed and used
*  roadways in America for decades. Emily, thank you. Thanks, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. On Wednesday, more than 100 people died in Iran
*  in a pair of explosions near the tomb of Qasem Soleimani, Iran's former security chief.
*  The blasts, which left hundreds more wounded, happened on the four-year anniversary of Soleimani's
*  death in an American drone strike. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, issued a statement
*  blaming the attack on Iran's, quote, malicious and criminal enemies, but stopped short of naming
*  any group or country. Today's episode was produced by Mujzadi and Claire Tennesketter.
*  It was edited by John Ketchum, contains original music by Diane Wong, and was engineered
*  by Alyssa Moxley. Our theme music is by Jim Runberg and Ben Landsvark of Wonderly.
*  That's it for the daily. I'm Sabrina Tavernisi. See you tomorrow.
