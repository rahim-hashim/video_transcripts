# Why Are So Many More Pedestrians Dying in the U.S.?

*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverny C. And this is the Daily.
*  A puzzling new pattern has taken hold on American roads.
*  Pedestrian traffic deaths, which have been under the climb for years, have skyrocketed.
*  Today, my colleague, Emily Badger, on her investigation into why.
*  It's Thursday, January 4th.
*  So Emily, you spent months investigating a very surprising trend.
*  And that is pedestrian deaths after decades of declines are now rising.
*  So we wanted to talk to you about that investigation and really look closely at this question of
*  why.
*  But before we get there, tell me how you came to this story.
*  Where'd you begin?
*  So I write about urban policy for the times, which means I write about transportation among
*  other things and sort of how people use it and how we get around and how important it
*  is to our lives.
*  And this one very apparent pattern keeps coming up over and over again, which is that
*  there has been this traffic safety crisis in America affecting in particular pedestrians.
*  You know, for years and years throughout the 80s, the 90s, the early 2000s, roads in
*  America were becoming safer and safer for pedestrians.
*  And then something changes around 2009.
*  All of a sudden, roads start to become more dangerous year over year.
*  So the point where more than 3,000 additional pedestrians died in 2021 compared to 2009.
*  And it's this incredible mystery for a number of reasons.
*  One of them is that we don't see anything like this in other industrialized countries.
*  We don't see pedestrian deaths rising if anything they're falling in other countries.
*  So in this mystery, there's something particular to the United States going on.
*  There's something that starts around 2009 going on.
*  And figuring out exactly what that is is not incredibly obvious, even transportation researchers
*  and regulators and engineers don't entirely know what's going on here.
*  So Emily, what did you do?
*  How did you try to solve this mystery in your reporting?
*  So I worked on this project alongside a colleague of mine, Ben Black.
*  But he spent a lot of time looking at federal fatality data in the United States.
*  The federal government records a lot of data every time someone dies on American roadways.
*  And we know about what kind of car was involved in the collision.
*  How old was the driver?
*  How old was the person who was killed?
*  What time of date did this happen?
*  And Ben discovers looking through this data, so many of these deaths that are happening
*  among pedestrians in the United States are happening at night.
*  And in fact, the vast vast majority of the rise in pedestrian fatalities in America that
*  starts around 2009 is occurring when it's dark out after sunset.
*  So you're saying the overall increase is entirely because of these nighttime deaths.
*  That is what's driving the change.
*  About 85% of the rise in pedestrian fatalities in America since 2009 is entirely attributable
*  to pedestrians dying in the darkness.
*  And so Ben and I set off to try to solve this incredibly difficult puzzle.
*  I mean, it is basically like a three-sided Rubik's cube, where we're trying to find answers
*  that fit three different criteria.
*  What is something that starts around 2009?
*  What is something that is particular to the United States that doesn't show up in other
*  countries?
*  And what is something that would explain effects that are worse at night than during the
*  daytime?
*  OK, so let's dig into that.
*  What did you start to find?
*  So Ben and I go out and we start collecting lots of very different theories about what could
*  be contributing to this problem.
*  And let's start with maybe the most obvious one, smartphones.
*  This timeline lines up fairly well with the rise of the smartphone in America.
*  Apple introduces the iPhone in 2007.
*  It very rapidly becomes ubiquitous and smartphones introduce new kinds of distraction into cars.
*  And they're also becoming ubiquitous at the same time as there is just this general proliferation
*  of technology inside of vehicles.
*  It used to just be that you had four or five dials that you could manipulate by touch,
*  that you had memorized.
*  You know, this is the one that controls temperature and this is the one that controls the radio
*  when you didn't have to look at them.
*  And now you have to do five different touch screens on five different buttons to try to
*  figure out how to turn the heat up.
*  Yeah, and you know, effectively we have something like a smartphone writ large attached to the
*  inside of the car in addition to the one in your hand.
*  And so that's potentially introducing distraction as well.
*  But other countries have smartphones and have stuff on the dashboard like that too.
*  So why would it be different in the US?
*  Right.
*  So then we have to start thinking about it a little bit harder.
*  And it's like, is there something about smartphones that, such as that they're being
*  used differently by drivers in America than in other parts of the world?
*  And we encounter some evidence that I think that this is true.
*  And this appears in some data that tracks how drivers actually use their phones, whether
*  not they're picking them up, touching them, tapping them, moving around while they're
*  in moving cars.
*  And it appears that American drivers are doing this more than they are in other countries.
*  But there's also sort of one other factor.
*  And this is probably my favorite thing that I learned in the course of reporting on this,
*  which is that if you think about the kinds of cars that we drive in America, overwhelmingly
*  almost all of us drive automatic transmission vehicles.
*  And these are cars that require kind of one hand to drive on the steering wheel.
*  And the second hand for much of your time, many people can do other things with it, including
*  picking up a smartphone.
*  Yes.
*  But this is not true in many pure countries that we would compare the United States to.
*  Interesting.
*  You know, in most of Europe, manual transmissions are far, far, far more common.
*  And a manual transmission vehicle is a vehicle that takes two hands to drive.
*  So even if there weren't cultural differences and expectations around whether or not it's
*  okay to use your smartphone while you're driving, you literally cannot use your smartphone
*  while you're driving as much in many parts of the world where everyone is driving a stick
*  shift.
*  Because physically it's pretty difficult.
*  Yeah.
*  And just to put this in perspective, the share of cars sold in America this year that have
*  a stick shift is about 1%.
*  Wow.
*  The share of cars on the road in Europe that have a stick shift is 70 to 75%.
*  Wow.
*  So the vast majority of cars on the road in Europe are stick shifts.
*  The vast majority of them in America are not.
*  Interesting.
*  Okay.
*  So that's a big and very compelling theory.
*  But what about the nighttime question, though, Emily?
*  I mean, do most people use their phones distractedly when they're behind the wheel actually at
*  night?
*  Yeah.
*  So this is another part of the puzzle that we have to think a little bit harder about.
*  It's not like people are only using them once the sun sets.
*  But we have a reason to think that people use them more in nighttime.
*  And we came across some data from a company that actually tracks how people are touching
*  and manipulating their phones while they're driving.
*  And their data suggests that distracted driving is most common in the evening time.
*  Interesting.
*  Why?
*  I mean, I think that's sort of consistent with the idea that, you know, you get off
*  of work and now is when you're coordinating with your significant other about who's going
*  to pick up the kids or go to the grocery store or with your friends who you're making plans
*  to meet at a bar and sort of social activity and coordination and communication.
*  And another theory that someone gave me was that this is also when a lot of people, particularly
*  in the United States, are responding to after-hours work messages.
*  I like it.
*  We have this kind of uniquely American always on work culture that says that like when
*  you're worked at ends, you're still responsible for paying attention to work and responding
*  to things.
*  And this is a small thing.
*  I don't want to suggest that like, you know, this is the overarching thing that explains
*  all of this.
*  But it's a small cultural thing that is different in the United States from other countries
*  that we would compare ourselves to.
*  Right.
*  Okay.
*  So phone use checks a lot of these boxes, right?
*  Because different in this way, there's a nighttime reason for it and it coincides with
*  the year that the trend really took off 2009.
*  What else did you find in your quest to solve this mystery?
*  So I think another big obvious thing that happens over the same time period is that American
*  cars are getting bigger and these bigger cars have higher hoods and a higher hood smashes
*  into a pedestrian, not at the legs, but at the chest, at the torso, at the head in these
*  more deadly pain points.
*  And it's also the case that bigger, heavier cars break slower.
*  So if someone driving one of these cars sees a pedestrian getting ready to cross the street
*  and they hit the brakes, that car may still collide with that pedestrian.
*  And researchers will tell you that a large part of the reason why the overall fatality
*  rates in the United States are so much higher than they are in other countries has to do
*  among other things with the fact that the vehicles that we drive here are so big.
*  But I guess I sort of thought, Emily, that American cars had always been big.
*  I mean, I remember going to Europe for the first time and thinking all the cars there
*  looked like little sneakers or skateboards or something, you know, that American cars
*  were so much bigger forever.
*  Yeah.
*  So if we come back to our recited Rubik's Cube, like this is one element where cars getting
*  bigger doesn't quite fit our puzzle.
*  It's part of the picture, but it's probably not the central most important theory involved
*  here because this is not something that starts in 2009.
*  I mean, Americans were driving SUVs back in the 90s.
*  It's also clear to us when we look at this federal fatality data, you know, smaller
*  cars sedans, they are killing more pedestrians today than they did 15 years ago.
*  So it's not just that there are fewer smaller cars, even smaller cars are killing more pedestrians
*  now.
*  Interesting.
*  And if we really believed it was the case that most of this change over the last 15
*  years is driven by cars getting bigger, then we would think that fatalities would be
*  rising during the daytime too, right?
*  Like a Ford 150 pickup truck is just as deadly at noon as it is a 10 p.m.
*  Right.
*  So now we have to start thinking about if the cars themselves don't explain this puzzle,
*  if the behavior of drivers alone can't explain all of this puzzle, now Ben and I are starting
*  to think, what is happening outside of vehicles?
*  What's happening in the country around cars that's contributing to this problem?
*  We'll be right back.
*  Okay.
*  So Emily, you and Ben keep going.
*  You look beyond the car, beyond the driver, into the world outside.
*  What do you find?
*  Yeah.
*  So there may be other things happening in the country over this time that would mean that
*  more pedestrians are in situations where they might be exposed to a deadly crash.
*  So these are the sort of exposure theories.
*  Okay.
*  So explain that and give me an example.
*  Yeah.
*  So one theory points to this kind of broader demographic trend.
*  Americans have been moving toward Sun Belt parts of the country, you know, toward warmer
*  parts of the country, metropolitan areas in Texas, in Florida.
*  And these are places that happen to have historically very bad pedestrian safety records.
*  And why is that?
*  So these are parts of the country that developed much more recently than New York City, Philadelphia,
*  Chicago.
*  They developed in the auto age after cars became ubiquitous and they're fundamentally built
*  around cars.
*  They don't have strong transit networks.
*  They don't have a lot of pedestrian infrastructure.
*  They're built around the assumption that everyone drives everywhere they go.
*  And maybe there are very few crosswalks or stoplights.
*  There are a lot of high speed arterial roads.
*  These are these really wide high speed roads that still occasionally have stoplights in the
*  middle of them.
*  And these are the kind of places where if you're a pedestrian and you want across the
*  street, maybe you have to walk half a mile up the road to be able to do that.
*  You know, that type of development is extremely common in these parts of the country where
*  people have increasingly been moving.
*  Okay.
*  So in other words, exposure to danger is higher in a place that's built around the car
*  not the walking person.
*  And as more people move to places like this and the Sun Belt is one of those places,
*  then more people are actually exposed to that danger.
*  That's the theory.
*  And just to give you an example, Florida especially really pops out in this data.
*  And over this time period that we've been talking about since 2009, pedestrian deaths
*  there are up by about 70%.
*  Wow.
*  70%.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know, that's not totally surprising when you think about the fact that to come back
*  again to the parts of the country that have really been booming in population, I'm thinking
*  of places like Tampa or Lando, Jacksonville, Daytona Beach.
*  Are these places that rank in the top 10 of the most dangerous for pedestrian safety
*  at the same time?
*  Right.
*  But you know, these are also places that I'm sure you know as a demographic supporter
*  and I know as a former one are big for retirees.
*  So does aging have to do with the trend at all?
*  Yeah.
*  This is another demographic story that's happening in the background in America over this
*  time period that we're talking about.
*  I mean, the American population is just getting older.
*  What we see here is actually that it's not older people who are really driving this trend.
*  It's more working age people.
*  It's people, you know, age 18 to 64 or so.
*  Okay.
*  So what else are you seeing Emily?
*  So another big shift that's happening in many American cities over part of this time
*  is that homelessness is rising.
*  And with homelessness, we are literally talking about extremely vulnerable people living
*  adjacent roads, living in highway interchanges in underpasses of major roads.
*  And this is a theory that fits another part of our puzzle in that these are people who
*  are present on roads at night.
*  But homelessness in America really sort of starts to rise in many cities around 2016
*  or so.
*  So this isn't a story that begins way back in 2009 or that has some abrupt sort of change
*  and trajectory around that time period.
*  But it is very clear in recent data just over the last few years that very large numbers
*  of pedestrians who are killed in some cities have been homeless.
*  You know, just to give you one example in Los Angeles, when I look at their pedestrian
*  fatality data there, it looks like about 30% of their deaths recently have been among
*  homeless people.
*  Wow.
*  So that means that this has to be at least part of what's going on here.
*  So Emily, you're talking about people being on dangerous roads at times when it's dark
*  out.
*  And you know, I remember when I was a national reporter, I started to notice that low
*  income people were actually moving out of expensive inner cities into much less expensive
*  suburbs.
*  And that many of those people I was interviewing and I was going to report on couldn't afford
*  cars.
*  And they'd actually be walking down the street early in the morning when it's dark
*  out to go to work.
*  And the street wouldn't be just a little country road.
*  It would be a major highway.
*  Is that part of what's going on here too?
*  I think that is absolutely got to be part of the story as well.
*  I mean, here what we're talking about is this national trend of the suburbanization of
*  poverty.
*  And we're talking about the income people moving into suburban environments, which very
*  similar to the sun belt environments we were just talking about.
*  These are places that have very few cross walks.
*  They often have no sidewalks at all.
*  And we're talking about people moving into those environments who, you know, they may be
*  doing shift work, working odd hours.
*  They may be relying on buses that come infrequently.
*  And that is potentially increasing exposure as well of people who are likely to be out
*  on the most dangerous roads in circumstances where they may be hit by a car.
*  In Portland, Oregon, for example, there are these notoriously dangerous arterial roads
*  on the eastern side of the city where historically pedestrian infrastructure has been really lacking.
*  And over the last decade or so, this is where people who have been priced out of more
*  expensive neighborhoods in Portland have been moving to.
*  And there's research that sort of suggests that this kind of pattern that I've just described
*  in Portland is apparent more nationally.
*  It appears as if pedestrian fatalities are actually declining in downtowns and where
*  their rising is in suburban environments like the one I've just described.
*  So this suggests, actually, that the people who are being killed are probably some of the
*  most vulnerable in American society, low income people walking to work along a highway
*  in the middle of the night going to a shift, can't afford a car, and homeless people.
*  Yeah, I think that's absolutely true.
*  I mean, the federal fatality data that we're looking at here doesn't tell us, for instance,
*  what's the income of the person who died?
*  But there's other research that suggests that these kind of fatality hotspots, these
*  most dangerous roads, are disproportionately occurring in low income neighborhoods.
*  And that means that this problem falls the heaviest on the most disadvantaged people.
*  Emily, looking back on everything that you found, would you say that you've solved the
*  mystery?
*  I don't think we solved the mystery in the sense that we didn't uncover one obvious thing
*  that explains all of this problem.
*  I think the best possible explanation is that multiple things have been happening over
*  the same time.
*  And those things are interacting with each other.
*  They're amplifying each other.
*  Darkness makes all of them worse.
*  And I think where Ben and I really land in thinking about this is that we have this fundamentally
*  risky transportation infrastructure in the United States.
*  We had this very clear example of this during the pandemic, where many fewer people were
*  driving.
*  There were far fewer cars on the road.
*  This was true all over the world.
*  And in most countries, fatalities declined because fewer people were on the road.
*  And you would think that the same thing would have happened in the United States, but it
*  didn't.
*  The opposite happened.
*  Fewer people were driving and still more people were dying.
*  More people were dying in all kinds of traffic fatalities, including pedestrians.
*  Why?
*  I think that gets back to the same sort of underlying idea here.
*  You know, during the pandemic, you take a lot of the cars off the road.
*  You take a lot of the people away from the picture.
*  And you can see really crystal clear what's left.
*  It's this transportation system that we've built that is designed for speed.
*  And all of a sudden, when there were fewer cars on the road, the drivers who remained felt
*  very comfortable driving fast, driving recklessly.
*  And that had these deadly consequences.
*  Interesting.
*  So what does that mean, Emily?
*  What do you take away from that?
*  I mean, I think this tells us that our system is not designed to protect pedestrians.
*  It's not designed to prioritize safety.
*  And thinking about this, this story really touched a nerve with a lot of our readers.
*  I mean, I heard from hundreds of them.
*  And many of them had their own theories, which are things that we didn't even touch on
*  here.
*  But you know, some of them also told me, I think it's about pedestrian behavior.
*  Pedestrians don't look both ways before crossing the street, like they used to in the
*  olden days.
*  They no longer wear light colors at night.
*  They're looking down at their phones and they're bringing this risk on themselves.
*  And I think the reality is that if we look at other countries, they are producing much
*  safer outcomes.
*  And they're not doing it by taking pedestrians' cell phones away or making pedestrians wear
*  reflective gear or spending a lot of money on public service campaigns that are teaching
*  pedestrians how to avoid being hit by cars.
*  They're doing it by fundamentally investing in how they design safe roads and making
*  a fundamental commitment in their laws and in their regulations to prioritizing safety
*  over cars traveling as fast as possible.
*  And what does that mean about the US and what's happening here?
*  So what that means here is that if we want to see fewer pedestrian fatalities, we need
*  to do those same things.
*  We need to be changing our roads to make them safer.
*  You know, we need to be telling drivers that if you're running through red lights, the
*  penalties for that are real, that we care about safety.
*  But in order for us to do those kinds of things, you know, that requires a big cultural change
*  to how we have thought about and designed and used roadways in America for decades.
*  Emily, thank you.
*  Thanks, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what Altus should know today.
*  On Wednesday, more than 100 people died in Iran in a pair of explosions near the tomb of
*  Kossim Soleimani, Iran's former security chief.
*  The blasts, which left hundreds more wounded, happened on the four-year anniversary of Soleimani's
*  death in an American drone strike.
*  Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Hamani, issued a statement blaming the attack on Iran's
*  quote, malicious and criminal enemies, but stopped short of naming any group or country.
*  Today's episode was produced by Mouj Zadhi and Claire Tennis Sketter.
