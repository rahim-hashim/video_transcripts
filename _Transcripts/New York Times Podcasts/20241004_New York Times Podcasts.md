# “The Daily” Analyzes Melania Trump’s Stance on Abortion
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrudQxpOfyM)
*  Melania Trump is pro-choice.
*  Her husband, more than any single elected official in the history of the republic, has
*  restricted abortion.
*  She said it in her book, and the Trumps have a history of putting things in books that
*  make a lot of news and sell those books.
*  I think there is a world in which this is not a hidden attempt to try to soften him,
*  although I imagine that he would welcome that and would make him happy and it was simply
*  a way for her to get her thoughts out and get attention.
*  But attention it is getting.
*  Abortion rights was not exactly a small issue when he was in office.
*  He was in the middle of appointing this conservative super majority of the Supreme Court, as you
*  noted, that repealed the Roe v. Wade abortion rights decision from 1973.
*  She is apparently against it.
*  Her husband is still struggling mightily with how to articulate what he actually thinks
*  on abortion while also saying that he terminated Roe v. Wade and he is very proud of it.
*  So I don't know how these two things align or how voters will receive it.
