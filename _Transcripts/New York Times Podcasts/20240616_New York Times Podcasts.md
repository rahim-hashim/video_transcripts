# 'Animal,' Episode 3: Manatees
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooLoe4O4hQ0)
*  Hey, it's Michael.
*  Today we have something really special for you.
*  A blissful break from the news.
*  It's a new series from NYT Audio called Animal.
*  My colleague Sam Anderson from the Times Magazine traveled the world to have encounters with
*  animals not to claim them or to tame them, but just to appreciate them.
*  Each episode is a journey to get closer to a creature that Sam loves.
*  For the next six weeks, we'll be running this limited series every Sunday here on the
*  Daily Feed.
*  But if you want to hear all the episodes right now, you can search for it wherever you get
*  your podcasts.
*  Today, episode three.
*  Hope you enjoy it.
*  From the New York Times, this is Animal.
*  I'm Sam Anderson.
*  Episode three.
*  Manatees.
*  Alright.
*  Good morning.
*  Good morning.
*  How are you today?
*  Hey.
*  Good.
*  Alright, how about yourself?
*  I'm good.
*  You picked a great day.
*  What are the rules on that?
*  Yeah, the rain's not an issue.
*  It's the lightning.
*  And I got an app on my phone here that's, yeah, we definitely have some lightning.
*  But it's their call, obviously.
*  But I'm not comfortable going out if there's a lot of lightning.
*  You don't want to be on the water during the lightning.
*  But so you all booked a private tour?
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Kelsey.
*  Yeah, I think Kelsey's going to join us.
*  For some reason, I do not fully understand.
*  I've always wanted to get in the water with a manatee.
*  A manatee is a big, pudgy, blubby-looking, I don't know, cross between a walrus and a
*  potato.
*  Sometimes people call them sea cows because they basically just float around grazing.
*  But they're a lot weirder looking than cows.
*  They have these funny little flippers, sort of boomerang-shaped flippers up front that
*  they use to navigate around, and then this big, flat paddle of a tail, like a super beaver
*  or something.
*  They eat wet vegetables, seagrass mainly, almost never aggressive.
*  They kind of float outside all of these cycles of predators and prey and doing stuff.
*  They just float there.
*  And I sort of want to float outside all of those cycles and just not worry about deadlines
*  and meetings and whatever.
*  It's stressful out there, but not under the water.
*  Looks like they're sending people out.
*  Yeah, they'll be watching the weather.
*  So when I think about getting in the water with a manatee, I don't know exactly what
*  I want to happen.
*  But when I really try to imagine it, I think what I want is for a manatee to look at me.
*  I want to see a manatee seeing me.
*  I want to look at a manatee and I want the manatee to look back at me.
*  And I just want to have a moment of connection or whatever it is.
*  Now manatees are a protected species.
*  And the only place I know of in the United States where you can legally swim with manatees
*  is a place in Florida called Crystal River.
*  You've heard about that place from watching the classic manatee documentary made by Jacques
*  Cousteau back in the 1970s.
*  And Jacques Cousteau and his whole crew of French oceanographers with their little red
*  beanies, they have a local guide and it's a kid, a teenager named Buddy Powell.
*  This is you in your element.
*  Yeah, this is my element.
*  Buddy Powell is actually still there in the decade since he's become maybe the preeminent
*  manatee scientist in the world.
*  And he's the director of a big marine center not far from Crystal River.
*  And he occasionally will still take people around Crystal River where he grew up as he
*  did for Jacques Cousteau.
*  What is this?
*  This is liability assumption of risk.
*  So we arranged a private boat tour with Buddy Powell.
*  Me and my colleague Caitlin Roberts who is there with the microphone.
*  Buddy's PR person Kelsey is going to join us too.
*  She's running a little late.
*  Okay, not here yet.
*  No, she's close though.
*  Alright guys, we're going to go ahead and get started.
*  So Caitlin and I had actually been in Florida for about a week before this swimming day.
*  Criss-crossing the state, talking to various manatee experts, kind of getting ready for
*  that moment when I get in the water and have an encounter.
*  Everyone here is for 10-15, correct?
*  And as soon as you start learning about manatees, things get pretty heavy.
*  Because from a distance, manatees make me very happy and I find them very soothing.
*  Manatees I don't think experience life that way, which we found out very quickly.
*  We talked to a guy who works with the Save the Manatee Club and he paddles around in
*  his canoe and he recognizes all the manatees by their scars, by the damage that they've taken.
*  So manatees are huge animals.
*  They float slowly and often right near the surface.
*  And so when a speedboat comes ripping through, often it will hit a manatee.
*  And getting hit by a speedboat is basically like getting hit by a truck that has swords
*  all over it.
*  So he's seen manatees sliced up so badly they don't have tails or hit so hard by a boat
*  that their ribs are sticking out.
*  Just the worst of the worst.
*  He also told us some really freaky stories about alligators that I'm not going to get
*  into right now.
*  Okay, where else did we go?
*  We went to this pathology lab in Tampa where they actually do autopsies on every manatee
*  that turns up dead in Florida to figure out the reasons why.
*  And they've been seeing a huge increase in the number of manatees that are coming in.
*  Sometimes it's just days on end, you know, eight, nine, ten manatees.
*  And when they open up the door the next day, it's just that many manatees again.
*  And it's just kind of nonstop.
*  The boat strikes, there's something called red tide, which is a kind of algae that blooms
*  in the water under certain conditions and makes manatees drown.
*  And then lately they've been seeing something really horrible, which is kind of new front
*  in this crisis, which is starvation.
*  Finding manatees with sand in their stomachs because they're just desperately rooting
*  around trying to find any bits that they can eat because the water quality has become so
*  bad that these huge seagrass meadows where manatees have been feeding for hundreds and
*  thousands of years are dying off.
*  And so they go there to eat and it's just fields of sand.
*  Should we get out on the boat?
*  You got to watch the...
*  Oh, we have to watch manatee manners?
*  Yeah.
*  Welcome to the Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge and the Kings Bay Manatee Refuge.
*  I kept asking these experts, like, how do you deal with this emotionally?
*  Is it hard?
*  Do you cry?
*  And the following activities or the attempt to perform any of the following activities
*  is prohibited throughout Kings Bay.
*  A lot of them were able to have a kind of scientific detachment.
*  They're just really trying to diagnose what's wrong and help as best they can.
*  But I remember one guy I spoke with, he surprised me a little bit.
*  I said, you know, do you have hope for the future of manatees?
*  And he said, deep in my heart, no.
*  But he said he's still...
*  He's deep in his heart, no, but he still hopes.
*  He also said if we can't save manatees, we can't save anything because manatees are so resilient.
*  They have really tough skin that's hard to cut.
*  They have very fast coagulation in their blood, so their wounds heal very quickly, which is
*  how they're able to survive so many of these boat strikes.
*  And so if we can't find a way to keep manatees alive, then we're not going to be able to
*  save anything.
*  Ready?
*  Let's do it.
*  I'm ready.
*  All right.
*  Bye.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Oh, blue sky.
*  I know.
*  To be honest, that kind of makes me hate us for wanting to swim with manatees.
*  Well, the people that don't follow the regulations.
*  Yeah, but even us in our stupid wetsuits floating around in the crowds of people staring at the
*  manatees, it's like, shut the whole thing down.
*  Well, hopefully people will feel a sense of awe and want to protect them.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  I guess that's like the risk-benefit ratio you have to weigh.
*  Yeah.
*  Like how much does this increase people's awareness and affection, therefore lead to
*  protection and all that?
*  How much does it bother the manatees and mess up the environment?
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  That's why there has to be, I mean, also a lot of regulation on the tour guides, too.
*  So after we signed all of our forms and squeezed into our wetsuits and watched this video,
*  we stepped outside and the sky had cleared miraculously and we got ready to step on this
*  boat where Buddy was going to drive us around and hopefully make my stupid manatee dream
*  come true.
*  Why don't we go over to the boat and then we can get after you.
*  Have you driven one of these before, sir?
*  I have.
*  Okay, so you understand that stream of water that needs to come out of the side of that
*  motor at all times.
*  So Buddy Powell, the local guide.
*  If you're ready to go, I'll get you on hook.
*  All right.
*  Thanks a lot.
*  Gets us in our boat and we toodle off into the water.
*  This is where you grew up?
*  This is where I grew up.
*  I was actually born in Clearwater, but my family had like a little fishing cottage
*  up here.
*  And I wanted to know all about his Jacques Cousteau experience and what that was like.
*  Were you aware of Jacques Cousteau at this point in your life?
*  I mean, back to back in the day when we only had three channels, right?
*  You know, you would sort of wait, you know, whether they come out like four times a year
*  or twice a year is like a big deal to watch that show.
*  So obviously, you know, very much a role model.
*  And it was kind of like a kid who loved nothing more than being in a boat who had memorized
*  all the creatures that lived in this habitat that he grew up in to get a call from Jacques
*  Cousteau in the 1970s when that name was as big as a name could be, especially for a
*  kid like that.
*  And so they kind of adopted me and took me under their wing.
*  And you must have felt like a little rock star.
*  It was pretty incredible.
*  That's that's for sure.
*  Did you did you wear the little red hat?
*  I did.
*  I did indeed.
*  Did you ever try smoking a pipe?
*  I never tried smoking a pipe.
*  No.
*  Did you drink some wonderful French wine?
*  I have definitely at that age.
*  They were trying to cultivate my inner Frenchness.
*  And yes, I drank my fair share of wine.
*  And it was a wonderful experience because I just absolutely fabulous.
*  And of course, that just changed my entire life.
*  So I'm going to be keeping an eye out, you know, as we're going along for manatees.
*  But I wanted to tell you a little bit about what we're seeing here.
*  So this this whole Crystal River.
*  And so, yeah, he's steering us all over his childhood territory.
*  And he's, of course, able to say, you know, this used to be like this and this used to be like that.
*  And now there's a giant mansion here.
*  And now he said the water used to be I mean, it's called Crystal River because the water used to be crystal
*  clear.
*  And now it's pretty murky in most of it.
*  The water quality has really plummeted.
*  And you used to see none of the of the boat traffic that we were seeing that day.
*  You would not see groups of tourists out there looking for manatees.
*  It was just it was just buddy and the manatees all alone back in those days.
*  What are these little heads that I keep seeing popping out of the water?
*  Those are turtles.
*  He's you know, I keep seeing things in the water.
*  You see like a little something pop up from the water and I'm like manatee.
*  But he's like, no, that's a turtle.
*  And something would jump out of the water and just be a fish.
*  But then at one point he did say, there it is.
*  Eleven o'clock.
*  So you can see the series of them.
*  And one in front of the other.
*  So it's just slowly swimming along.
*  That's right.
*  And we saw this manatee off to the left of the boat.
*  So we don't want to disturb it because it's there coming up to the surface.
*  See the back.
*  There's the back of it.
*  So that's a nice adult manatee.
*  The tail we saw though.
*  See its back come up and then its tail and it would leave these buddy called tail prints on the water.
*  That's so you can sort of follow where it was going.
*  And it was really thrilling to see one so far from shore just doing its natural thing.
*  Does it still feel special for you to see a manatee?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I it's hard to explain it.
*  But every time I see a manatee, I still get excited about it.
*  And I can watch them for.
*  So back, you know, back then.
*  So we're cruising around.
*  He's taking us down little little side coves.
*  And as we're cruising around, we keep seeing these guys are probably with one.
*  Those guys over there are probably with one.
*  These other tourist boats and crowds of people in the water.
*  And that was the fastest way to find a manatee.
*  It's kind of like when you're a Yellowstone, the fastest way to find a bear is to find the traffic jam of people looking at the bear on the side of the road.
*  Here, there were traffic jams of boats and crowds of tourists who were floating with pool noodles and, you know, flippers and goggles.
*  And and they're all just kind of hanging around a manatee while it's eating.
*  I don't know. I feel almost inclined not to get in the water with a big crowd of people staring at one manatee.
*  Yeah, I can understand.
*  So we're kind of keeping our distance because once I see that, it's not it's not what I imagined for my manatee encounter.
*  Somehow it does not feel to me like outside of the predator prey hustle and bustle chain, the sort of.
*  Whoa.
*  Two propellant.
*  You tell what size that one was.
*  Small adult.
*  Hanging out at the bottom.
*  You describe what the scene looks like.
*  Well, we got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight plus boats out here full of people in wetsuits.
*  And then we've got groups of people in wetsuits with pool noodles and snorkels sticking up who are in the water kind of face down.
*  All in a in a tight cluster, we assume, staring at one manatee.
*  We've got two or three groups of people like that.
*  Yeah, we've got boats with docked outside of houses.
*  Boats with huge, huge, powerful looking motors.
*  This boat has two giant motors on the back, two big Honda motors.
*  And as you can see, he's certain he doesn't realize that there's a manatee.
*  As you can see, you see the bottom is not really that shallow.
*  So he could be doing some damage.
*  Well, he's going slowly enough that that manatee will move out of the way.
*  But if he wasn't going slowly, yes, absolutely.
*  And not only that, it's just a matter of disturbance to these animals.
*  They become somewhat habituated, but generally they just want to be left alone to feed.
*  So we basically did this all day.
*  We see a manatee. It would be surrounded by a crowd and I would say, well, let's try another one.
*  And finally, the day was over. I was sunburned. We had to take the boat back.
*  And we went to this little lagoon and there was a manatee and there was a crowd of people around it.
*  I don't know, Kelsey, how do you feel? Do you want to jump in?
*  I mean, I'm hot, so.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, me too.
*  I thought about it and decided, OK, I guess we should probably just do it.
*  We could do it here.
*  Yeah, since we know we're here.
*  Came all this way. I don't want to miss my opportunity and regret it later.
*  So I guess I'll just be one of the crowd and get in there.
*  What do you think? Let's try it.
*  These guys are kind of harassing me a little bit.
*  And sometimes Buddy would point out like, oh, they're kind of harassing that manatee.
*  You're really not supposed to be that close or you're not supposed to be swimming after it.
*  You just stay still and let it do what it wants.
*  You don't follow it. You don't interact. You just look.
*  Told me to just float like a log when I get in there.
*  Try to stay at least.
*  A manatee or two length away from it.
*  OK, what if it approaches and you just stay still?
*  And let it do its its thing.
*  And like I said, just pretend to be another object in the water.
*  All right, so Sam, I'm going to stay up here.
*  Maybe you can kind of tell me what you're doing as you're doing it.
*  As you're getting in the water.
*  All right. Well, I'm going to put this snorkel on.
*  And take my shoes off.
*  OK, so there's two right here just feeding.
*  And so what you don't want to do is disturb them in any way and just be as quiet as you possibly can.
*  Keep a keep an eye on keep an eye on me because I can obviously I don't get in the water as I can spot and see further away.
*  And so I'll sort of give you directions. I don't like to yell out over the water.
*  But just occasionally just lift your head up and take a look at me.
*  Keep an eye out for alligators.
*  I'll tell you if one comes.
*  So, you know, I was I was in my wetsuit already.
*  I put on my flippers and my goggles and my snorkel and got in the water.
*  So 72 degrees doesn't feel that warm, kind of chilly water.
*  So I get in and the water is is very murky.
*  There's a lot. Eleven o'clock.
*  Twelve o'clock. Eleven o'clock.
*  There's there's a lot of plants, a lot of seagrass.
*  And so it's just like murk and seagrass.
*  And I can't really see where I'm going.
*  But I know the general direction the manatee is in.
*  And Buddy is kind of shouting out, you know, it's at eleven o'clock and he's guiding me across the water.
*  So I'm kind of just swimming with a face full of murky seagrass and I can't see where I'm going.
*  And I'm not sure if I'm going anywhere.
*  And then all of a sudden it was such a shock.
*  All of a sudden I come shooting out of the murk and I'm just I'm like on top of the manatee practically.
*  I did not see it coming. By the time I saw it, I was there.
*  And it's it's eating, facing away from me.
*  And so I come to a stop basically right next to its gigantic tail, which I know from my manatee research is so strong and potentially dangerous.
*  And so I was instantly kind of panicked.
*  But I also knew that rule number one of being near a manatee is that you can't panic and thrash around because you'll scare the manatee and then it will potentially thrash.
*  And so I had to sort of work as hard as I could to stop my momentum as quickly, but as gently as I could until my momentum stopped just like inches from the manatee tail.
*  And I was able to kind of scooch backwards very slowly until I was a few feet away.
*  And then I just watched.
*  I just stared because this thing was so otherworldly, almost like ghostly pale kind of gray color, almost like glowing.
*  In the light. And it's just peacefully eating grass and all these other people around me.
*  But we're not noticing each other at all because we're all just so in awe of this manatee, really.
*  And I don't know how long I floated there, but for a pretty long time.
*  And then I decided, all right, I saw a manatee.
*  Didn't turn around and look at me, which I mean, why would it?
*  But that was OK.
*  So very gently, I turned and I.
*  Swam through the Merck back to the boat and.
*  Just as I was starting to tell everybody what I had seen, one of the one of the little crowd watching the manatee each shouted.
*  It's turning. It's coming your way.
*  And I turned and the manatee had turned around and was swimming directly toward our boat.
*  And so I just gently let go of the ladder and dropped back under the water to see what it was going to do.
*  And the manatee came right over to me and I just.
*  I just.
*  I just.
*  I just.
*  I just.
*  I just.
*  I just.
*  I just.
*  And the manatee came right over to me and started grazing the seagrass right next to our boat, kind of down below my flippers.
*  And so I just floated there, suspended, watching it.
*  And then after a few seconds, the most magical thing happened, which is the manatee stopped eating.
*  And it tilted its body up vertical.
*  And it floated up toward the surface.
*  And it paused and it looked at me.
*  Like it really looked me in the eyes.
*  And I was looking at the manatee and the manatee was looking at me.
*  And I always fantasized about this moment and all the many feelings that would pass between us.
*  And we would just kind of beam warm feelings back and forth to each other.
*  I felt in the manatee's gaze.
*  I felt nothing.
*  There was no magical soul connection.
*  And that was that was good and normal.
*  And the fantasy I had was abnormal.
*  I should probably talk to my therapist Susan about it.
*  On Friday at 1 p.m.
*  And so it kept drifting up and it took a breath.
*  And then it went back down with bubbles coming out.
*  And it tilted itself back to horizontal and it started just swimming past me and under the boat.
*  And this thing was so huge.
*  It took forever. It felt like it felt like it was swimming in slow motion.
*  I just watched its whole pale glowing body kind of pass right in front of my face.
*  Peacefully gracefully.
*  And its huge tail came by last.
*  And then it was gone.
*  And I went back up to the surface.
*  This one here was so close.
*  It was feeding right there.
*  It came up surfaced right in front of me to breathe.
*  It looked at me.
*  Which if that was my goal I wanted to be looked at by a manatee.
*  Looked deep into your soul?
*  No she didn't.
*  And I really was so jazzed.
*  It was very profound.
*  It just looked at me.
*  I feel good. I feel happy.
*  Harmful?
*  Yeah I feel like weirdly fulfilled.
*  Like a life mission has been fulfilled.
*  What was it like?
*  It was sweet.
*  I wonder where that manatee is now.
*  I bet it's right near the same spot eating.
*  Eating grass.
*  Taking a nap.
*  Farting.
*  Sending bubbles up to the surface.
*  Big jowls shaking while it chews its lettuce.
*  Its grass.
