# The Bombshell Case That Will Transform the Housing Market

*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, a bombshell legal settlement reached a few days ago is about to change almost everything
*  about buying and selling a home and in the process make it significantly cheaper.
*  My colleague, Deborah Keman, explains.
*  It's Wednesday, March 20th.
*  Hi, Deborah.
*  Hi, Michael.
*  What a treat.
*  Talk of this.
*  It's a real.
*  Do you want me to just go?
*  No, I'm going to ask you a question.
*  I'm ready.
*  This is a conversation.
*  I mean, I came ready to roll.
*  What do you want me to do?
*  So Deborah, at the highest possible level, what just happened to American real estate?
*  Michael, there's been this invisible hand that's been guiding and controlling the real estate
*  industry for over a hundred years.
*  And they have long thought that they were absolutely untouchable because they had so
*  much power, so much influence, so much money.
*  And the biggest crack in their armor that's ever happened just happened on Friday.
*  Well, what is this crack in the armor?
*  And I guess who even is this nefarious sounding group that you're talking about?
*  The group is the National Association of Realitors.
*  Nearly nine out of ten home sales are handled by real estate agents affiliated with NAR.
*  And the crack in the armor is that they have had these rules that have controlled how
*  much buyers and sellers pay to their agents and how you work with agents to get a home
*  on the market.
*  And then last week for the first time in its history, NAR's control over this huge industry,
*  which we all thought was untouchable.
*  It basically collapsed.
*  And with it, so did many of the costs, it was imposing on consumers.
*  Okay.
*  The sound huge.
*  I think we need to slow this whole thing down.
*  And I think the way to do that is to have you tell us the story of how the National Association
*  of Realitors, which is not at all a household name, became such a powerful force in the
*  ritual of buying and selling a home in the United States.
*  The NAR is huge.
*  Over their existence, they've grown to 1.5 million members.
*  More importantly, they've created a system where you really cannot sell a house unless
*  you're a member.
*  They even own the copyright to the word realtor.
*  They own the copyright to the word realtor?
*  They own the copyright.
*  They even had a campaign a couple years ago to convince people how to say properly and
*  correctly.
*  They take this very seriously.
*  Okay, okay, I'll buy it.
*  How do you say a property?
*  It's realtor, not realtor.
*  Realtor.
*  Two syllables, not three.
*  Very important.
*  Extremely important.
*  So I should say, on paper, you can sell a house if you're not a realtor, if you're just
*  a real estate agent.
*  And not a member of NAR.
*  Exactly.
*  But in practice, it's really not that easy because of the system they've created.
*  They make it very difficult.
*  For example, if you want to list a home for sale, you have to put it on something called
*  an MLS, a multiple listing service.
*  And MLSs, for the most part, are owned and operated by the local subsidiaries of NAR.
*  They control the databases in which homes basically enter the market.
*  Exactly.
*  And not only the databases in which homes enter the market, but the databases through
*  which realtor is telling each other how much commission they will get paid if they sell
*  those homes.
*  And the databases are very important because databases are where real estate agents can see
*  how much commission they will make if they bring a buyer or they sell a home.
*  Typically, when you sell a house in the US, you pay a commission fee.
*  It's usually around 5 or 6% to realtor's.
*  This is how realtor's are making their money.
*  It's what you're paying them for everything they're doing, listing the house, showing
*  the house, answering all your questions.
*  Making improvements in the house?
*  Yeah.
*  And it's how they make a living.
*  But it's a very high rate.
*  5 or 6% is one of the highest rates in the world.
*  Almost no other developed country has a rate that high.
*  OK, and let's talk about 6% for this.
*  That's a number everyone knows if you've ever especially sold a home because it's a number
*  you hate.
*  You hate the fact, no offense, to realtor's, that you have to give 6% of the money you
*  get for your home to a real estate agent.
*  Right.
*  Well, two real estate agents because it gets split.
*  Half goes to the seller agent.
*  Half goes to the buyer agent.
*  Right.
*  And just to put it in perspective, I think it's useful.
*  If you're selling a million dollar house, 6% fee is $60,000.
*  If you're selling a half million dollar house, it's $30,000.
*  Either way, you slice it.
*  It's a lot of money to put in somebody else's pocket for a huge investment that you made.
*  You're trying to get the money into your pocket, but it's coming out of your pocket and
*  go into the agent.
*  Exactly.
*  You're saying the national association of realtor's should be seen as essentially the force behind
*  that 6% fee, the loathed 6% fee, staying what it has been for so long.
*  NAR will say we never set 6%, we don't have 6% set in stone.
*  That is true.
*  But they created rules that led to a system where that 6% has become the industry standard.
*  And anyone trying to challenge it, their business model has fallen apart.
*  Fascinating.
*  And here's how they control the market.
*  For example, if you're a real estate agent and you want to open that home for a customer,
*  in most markets NAR controls the lock boxes that you use to open the homes.
*  Everyone knows what those lock boxes look like with little punchkey.
*  NAR actually owns one of the two companies in America that makes those lock boxes.
*  Wow.
*  And in many markets, they require their agents to use their own technology.
*  And then let's say you open the home, you bring a buyer, you want to sell the home, the
*  actual technology that you use to sell the home, which is DocuSign.
*  They own a controlling stake in that company.
*  So every aspect of the home selling transaction from the very beginning to the very end, that
*  hand of NAR is guiding it and behind it.
*  And it's been there for 100 years.
*  Wow.
*  I mean, that sounds an awful lot like monopolistic level of power.
*  The word monopoly gets thrown around all the time when critics are talking about NAR.
*  Another word that comes up a lot is the word cartel.
*  There's a lot of power.
*  There's a lot of control.
*  And there's also a very organized drive to go after anyone who tries to challenge them.
*  Hmm.
*  This is just not a level of influence that I associate with the trade group.
*  I think of trade groups as kind of gathering people together for professional development.
*  Just having a happy hour at the hotel.
*  Exactly.
*  Right.
*  Not controlling A to Z elements of the industry.
*  If there was an NAR in journalism, it sounds like they would control the printing presses.
*  How is it possible that no private company has come along and tried to break into this NAR
*  controlled market or that the government hasn't looked at it and thought cartel monopoly.
*  We got to bust this up.
*  People have definitely tried.
*  So it's not that it's people have not tried.
*  The challenge is that NAR because they have so much power, they have quashed any attempts
*  at challenging them.
*  Like what?
*  They sue the heck out of anybody who comes after them.
*  There have been upstart companies that have tried to advertise homes outside of these multiple
*  listing services that NAR controls.
*  And NAR has sued them and then you get buried in tens of thousands of dollars of legal fees
*  for an upstart tech company.
*  That's a death blow.
*  What about the government?
*  The government has also been going after NAR for more than 20 years.
*  The DOJ and NAR have been locked into battle back and forth since 2005.
*  But in terms of the government, NAR is not just a trade organization.
*  They are also a political action committee.
*  They have the largest pack in Washington in terms of dollars raised and they give millions
*  of dollars to candidates who are in line with their agenda and they spend millions of
*  dollars fighting candidates who are not in line with their agenda.
*  So anyone in the government who wants to go after NAR knows that they are fighting a battle
*  that probably is bigger and more moneyed than they really want to deal with.
*  Right.
*  Sounds a little bit like another Washington organization with similar acronym, which is
*  the NRA, the National Life Association, which has kept a very strong lid on efforts to
*  challenge its authority with campaign dollars.
*  There is a playbook for this sort of behavior and it has followed pretty clearly.
*  Right.
*  But I don't think any of us quite understood it was happening in the housing market.
*  Right.
*  And at the end of the day, it wasn't the government that brought them down and it wasn't
*  a venture capital firm with a ton of money, fighting them or trying to be an upstart group.
*  It was five normal blue collar homeowners and a personal injury lawyer from Missouri
*  who had never dealt with the housing market before in his life.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, to tell us about this unexpected cast of characters that ends up bringing down the
*  National Association of Realtors.
*  So Michael, in 2018-2019, there was a group of home sellers in Missouri who had learned
*  that they had paid pretty high fees to the real estate agents and they might have a legal
*  case against them.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  They were probably paying that kind of standard 6% fee to their agents when they saw the house,
*  right?
*  They were paying the standard 6% fee, but the key was they had not known that that fee
*  was actually negotiable.
*  They thought they had to pay it.
*  Okay.
*  Here I need to pause.
*  It is actually negotiable.
*  It is actually negotiable.
*  It is?
*  And that's the thing.
*  NAR has always said we don't set the fees.
*  There is no standard fee.
*  But in practice, if consumers don't know that the fee isn't negotiable and if consumers
*  are told by their agents that they cannot negotiate the fee, that is the fee.
*  Hmm.
*  Okay.
*  So, these folks discover that perhaps they didn't need to pay 6% and did what do they
*  do?
*  They contacted a lawyer and they started going through the contracts that they'd signed
*  when they sold their homes.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  One of the people went back through her contract and the contract actually said what
*  fee do you want to pay your agent?
*  And it said 6%, 7%, 8%, or 9%.
*  So she did the smart thing and she chose the lowest fee, circled 6%, and that's what she
*  paid.
*  Right.
*  In other words, like a tipping machine that says 20, 22, 25.
*  When you go buy a coffee and the tip starts at 22%.
*  Right, right, right.
*  Exactly.
*  It is inconceivable that there is anything beneath that.
*  Or that you actually could opt out.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  Okay.
*  So, someone else, he is the son of a factory worker.
*  He's now the head of mothers against drunk driving in Missouri.
*  These are really blue-collar people.
*  He was told that he was going to be charged 5.5%.
*  He found out later that he was charged 6%.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  So his agent just jacked up the fee without telling him.
*  So all these people realized we left money on the table at the most important financial
*  transaction of our entire lives and we probably have a legal claim against the institution
*  that set the rules that made it so this was possible.
*  NAR.
*  NAR.
*  So not only are they upset that they had to pay 6%.
*  And they could have negotiated it and did not know.
*  They also are realizing that they have paid the fee to the agent that's representing the
*  person that they're going against in the negotiation for the home sale.
*  Which is the buyer.
*  Which is the buyer.
*  Right.
*  Because that you said earlier, the nature of a 6% fee is that it is split between the seller's
*  agent and the buyer's agent.
*  Which no one really tells you or reminds you, but that's what happened.
*  Because it's all happening through a back door on these multiple listing sites that you
*  can only see if you're a real estate agent who belongs to NAR.
*  Okay.
*  So what ends up happening to all these sellers once they discover in their minds that they've
*  been wronged and that they want to do something about it?
*  They hire this attorney, Michael Ketchmark.
*  He's a personal injury lawyer from Missouri.
*  Pretty much nobody outside of Kansas City had heard of him until this moment.
*  He decides he's going to file a class action lawsuit.
*  This is not the best time for NAR.
*  This is actually the moment that they were really coming onto my radar as a reporter.
*  I had spent last summer focused on sexual harassment allegations at NAR.
*  And I discovered that NAR's president, his name was Kenny Parcel, had years and years
*  of sexual harassment accusations against him that had been covered up and women had been
*  paid off.
*  And at the times, we published a big expose on those allegations at the end of August.
*  And he stepped down two days later.
*  Your reporting got the head of this incredibly powerful organization to step down.
*  It did and there have been other resignations since then.
*  And that moment for NAR really put them on the world stage.
*  Suddenly people are aware that the leader of the organization is an alleged sexual
*  harasser.
*  And women who've been whistleblowers about the sexual harassment have been paid off.
*  And all of that is happening at NAR behind the scenes when this case where they're being
*  accused of price fixing ends up going to trial.
*  Got it.
*  Okay.
*  So we're going to be going to this case as it moves to the legal system just as NAR's
*  leader has been forced out.
*  So the case goes forward and NAR says, okay, we have a new president.
*  We're kind of in disarray, but we are going to regroup.
*  We're going to fight this.
*  We're absolutely not going to settle.
*  Okay.
*  What ends up happening at this trial?
*  They come guns blazing, high powered corporate lawyers, black suits, tons of money.
*  And up against them, you have catch mark in his team of plaintiffs.
*  And the jury really liked what catch mark had to say.
*  I can't say jury found the National Association of Realtors and other organizations conspired
*  to keep Realtor commission fees high.
*  They agreed that these home sellers were not told that they couldn't negotiate the prices.
*  The plaintiffs argued the organization forced home sellers to pay both the seller and
*  buyer fees, calling that practice wrong and illegal.
*  So late in October of last year, NAR has found guilty of price fixing.
*  And the jury came back and said, yeah, you're guilty.
*  And the damages are $1.8 billion.
*  Wow.
*  What we proved was the National Association of Realtors has joined in a conspiracy with
*  the two of the largest corporate real estate brokers to use the system to fix prices.
*  So what happens within hours of this verdict coming through is the floodgates open?
*  The minute that that verdict came in, we filed a lawsuit against the National Association
*  of Realtors and these other large corporate real estate companies to bring the same relief
*  nationwide.
*  Catch mark turns around the same day that he won this case and files a national case.
*  So we're talking the exact same argument, but now it's not just Missouri.
*  It's the whole country.
*  The money will be returned to the homeowners that were the victims of this rigged system.
*  It's been going on in our country for about 100 years and it stops today.
*  Wow.
*  So every seller and the customer.
*  Every seller in the customer.
*  Every person who sold a home in the past four years is now part of this case.
*  If they paid a 6% commission and didn't know it.
*  Wow.
*  Across the country already sensed that case, a case filed by buyers in Illinois, also sellers
*  in Missouri, New York, Texas, and South Carolina.
*  There's also an Illinois case that was.
*  Other copycat suits start happening and within weeks were up to almost 20 lawsuits against
*  NAR.
*  All saying, you are a monopoly.
*  You have anti-trust violations and these rules need to change.
*  It's been a major shake up in the real estate world today.
*  If a settlement is approved in court, homes make it cheaper and agents and brokers could
*  be out of business.
*  So in the face of all these lawsuits, NAR finally agrees to settle.
*  In late last week, early Friday morning, they agree to a settlement that includes massive
*  changes that are going to introduce competition into the marketplace.
*  The biggest one being the rules that led to that 6% commission are gone.
*  Gone.
*  Gone.
*  So is the 6% fee perhaps now gone?
*  It will.
*  It will go away because competition is now going to enter the marketplace.
*  And when competition comes in, people have to lower their fees as a result.
*  A really good example, if you want to look at a precedent in history, is the travel industry.
*  It used to be if you wanted to book a vacation or buy a flight, you had to go through travel
*  agents.
*  Right.
*  And you had to pay what they told you to pay.
*  But then we had things enter the marketplace like Expedia and Kayak and Priceline.
*  The same way we now have Zillow and Redfin.
*  We do a lot of the searching for homes ourselves.
*  Just not the buying in the self.
*  But the fees for searching for a home have not changed, even though the service itself
*  has.
*  It's a lot cheaper now to book travel than it was when you had to go through an agent.
*  It's going to be a lot cheaper to book a real estate agent now as well to sell your home.
*  Okay.
*  I think I understand.
*  I want to talk about what it would mean for the 6% commission to go away.
*  Because as we've talked about previously in this conversation, that was the immovable
*  fact of buying and selling a home and a huge amount of money.
*  A huge amount of money.
*  Americans spend about $100 billion a year on real estate commissions alone.
*  Unbelievable.
*  Economists forecast that they're probably going to see that number drop by $20 to $50 billion
*  because these commissions are going to go down.
*  But where it really matters is housing prices.
*  Housing prices have become higher because real estate commissions are baked into the housing
*  price.
*  If you're selling a house and your agent says to you, when you sell this house, you're
*  going to have to pay a 6% fee.
*  So we're just going to bump up the price of the house by 6% to absorb that cost.
*  Imagine now those fees going down across the board.
*  That bump bump is going down as well.
*  So housing prices are going to dip.
*  It's one of the most significant changes we've seen to the housing industry in 100 years.
*  Yeah, I mean, you think about it.
*  If you take a 6% fixed fee in the system and you get rid of it, and if you're right,
*  housing prices fall.
*  What this NAR change means is that the entire US housing market is about to be discounted.
*  It's about to go on sale.
*  It's the prices are about to drop.
*  Absolutely.
*  Okay.
*  What else does this element do?
*  The other major change is that if you are a seller's agent and you're listing a home
*  for sale, you can no longer make an offer of commission to the buyers agents on these
*  MLS databases.
*  So buyers agents will no longer be able to say, hey, I'm only going to take people to
*  homes where I know I'm guaranteed to get 3%.
*  Okay.
*  I want to just make sure I understand that.
*  So in addition to this settlement, essentially ending the reign of the 6% commission, it's
*  ending this kind of informal conspiracy that's been going on between buyers agents and seller
*  agents where they kind of wink and nod at each other and say, I'm going to get my 3%,
*  you're going to get your 3%, in fact, what it does is it kind of ends the very nature
*  of the two colluding over who's going to get what?
*  There was nothing informal about it.
*  It was happening in broad daylight on these MLSs.
*  Right.
*  But of course, we were on those MLSs.
*  But we didn't know exactly.
*  And now we know.
*  Okay.
*  So those are two colossal changes to the market.
*  But it leaves me with a question.
*  This settlement sounds like it represents people who were in the class action lawsuits.
*  But if I sold a home, I don't know, like three, four years ago, and I look at this settlement
*  and I say congratulations to those in it, but what about me?
*  What about the fact that I, and a million and a half other people, we paid our 6% fees.
*  What's in it for us?
*  Yes, Michael, by borrow.
*  You could also make money from this settlement.
*  And I, Debra Kamen, could also make money from this settlement.
*  The settlement is a global settlement because there were so many lawsuits going on at once.
*  It didn't just settle that case in Missouri with the five homeowners.
*  It settled all of them.
*  It's a class action suit that applies to almost every person in America who sold a home
*  over the last few years.
*  Interesting.
*  And over the next few years, it's going to take a while, but we're all going to get letters
*  that are going to ask us if you sold a home and if you paid commission.
*  Right.
*  And you know, we've all gotten these letters where you parted.
*  Did you buy a piece of meat from the supermarket on the state?
*  Did you buy a piece of the housing market on the state as the letters we're going to get?
*  And depending on how many people fill out these letters and send them back and how big
*  that pot of money has grown to by the end of it because there's still some lawsuits
*  that are simmering, that money is going to be devied up and parts of it are going to go
*  to homeowners.
*  No one's going to get rich off of this.
*  But yes, we all stand to get a small chunk of it.
*  If this is in fact, as you're describing it, a kind of revolution in the American realistate
*  industry, the downfall of NAR, the changes of all these rules, we know that revolutions
*  can be very fast or they can be very slow.
*  And I'm curious if you can, in your mind's eye, kind of imagine what the real estate market
*  is going to look like in five or 10 years and how much better or more accessible it might
*  be for people as a result of these changes.
*  And I'm asking that in particular because here on the daily, we've talked so much about
*  how cruel the US housing market is right now.
*  There's shortage, prices are really high.
*  And young people in particular feel completely locked out of the market.
*  And so is this really going to do something about that or is it really going to only feel
*  like it's at the margins?
*  No, it will help them, but not in the clean, easy way that you may think.
*  One of the major follow-ups of this settlement is going to be the fact that NAR stands to
*  lose something like two thirds of its members.
*  Because the major reason people have stayed members of NAR, it's because they needed access
*  to home listings.
*  Right.
*  And they control the home listings.
*  And if that access has been broken by the settlement deals, people are fed up with NAR.
*  They pay $100 a year to be a member.
*  And now they're saying, what do you do for me?
*  After all this, you lost in court.
*  And now I don't even have access to these listings for my commission.
*  So when they lose two thirds of their members, that group is now also losing two thirds of
*  the people who donate to their political action committee.
*  Right.
*  And that lobbying arm in Washington has now been very significantly blunted.
*  And that lobbying arm in Washington is one of the biggest forces behind pro-landlord policies,
*  stopping things like red control.
*  All of the initiatives in DC that have made the housing market so very brutal for so many
*  Americans.
*  So in the long run, this is going to have a serious impact that will completely change the dynamics
*  of the real estate market.
*  So if we take the NAR out of the equation, we get a more consumer tenant-friendly housing
*  market.
*  And that is very likely to happen because this settlement essentially kneecaps NAR and
*  leaves its current members with no real incentive to stay members.
*  That is absolutely correct.
*  So it's going to take time.
*  But there's going to be all sorts of ripple effects from this that go well beyond $480
*  million.
*  Right.
*  At the end of the day, Debra, this feels like the story of a monopoly that outlived all
*  other monopolies in our system.
*  Right.
*  I mean, American economic history is littered with the story of industries where a group or
*  a company have a stranglehold and it gets broken up.
*  That's the idea of a fair economy.
*  This one lasted so long despite the fact that what it controlled was a pillar of the American
*  dream, which is owning a home.
*  And I wonder how you think about the fact that it took so long to do it.
*  It genuinely shocks me, I guess I'm saying, that this dynamic lasted as long as it did.
*  It shocks me too.
*  And I have to say when I started this beat about a year ago, I didn't know what NAR was.
*  Most Americans had no idea that this organization had so much control and so much power over
*  the housing market.
*  The housing market is 20% of the US GDP.
*  This is a huge organization that's been guiding everything from the wings.
*  But what I love about this story is that at the end of the day, it was just five normal
*  home sellers who took them on in court in Kansas City and a personal injury lawyer and
*  they won.
*  And that irony is not lost on the lawyer.
*  He, after the settlement, set me a quote.
*  It was a David Vs.
*  Goliath quote from the Bible.
*  That is how he sees himself.
*  And in many ways, that is what this story is.
