# Why the Banking Crisis Isnâ€™t Over Yet
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmMaRtyXRus)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is a daily.
*  There is growing concern that the bank crisis could spread.
*  Today, shares of San Francisco-based First Republic Bank lost more than half their value
*  on Wall Street.
*  Today, as the banking crisis enters its second week,
*  Worst week since 2020, last week, John, and this week is not starting out on a better
*  note.
*  We look at the spreading fallout.
*  Elsewhere in the regional banks as well, PacWest, Western Alliance, Zion, they're all down
*  substantially in the first few minutes of training.
*  And why the government's attempt to contain it is meeting so much resistance from bank
*  investors and customers.
*  We turn once again to my colleague, Emily Flitter.
*  It's Friday, March 17th.
*  Emily, it has now been nearly a week since this banking crisis began.
*  And if we roll back the clock to more or less this very moment a week ago, last Thursday,
*  customers of Silicon Valley Bank were frantically withdrawing $42 billion from that bank.
*  It was becoming a huge crisis, which is why the U.S.
*  government stepped in and took over that bank and began crafting a rescue operation that
*  involved taking over yet another bank, Signature Bank.
*  And that's where things were when we talked to you earlier this week.
*  And where that episode left off was with President Biden telling Americans, your money is safe.
*  It's going to be OK.
*  So pick up the story from there.
*  So when we last spoke, it was Monday afternoon, there was still this sense that everybody
*  was holding their breath trying to figure out exactly how the federal government's actions
*  were landing.
*  And there were a lot of questions like, how would bank investors react as the week wore
*  on and how would bank customers react?
*  Would people still be itching to get their money to a different spot?
*  What we saw was that everybody was jittery.
*  And one of the places where the continued lack of confidence was most evident was in
*  the regional banks, First Republic, Western Alliance, PacWest.
*  These banks were still seeing customers pull their money out and they were seeing their
*  stock value plummet, too.
*  And what's your sense, Emily, of why these regional banks and their stock, why they're
*  plunging when this federal plan that had been announced over the weekend, which we talked
*  to you about in this episode, was designed to reassure everyone that things were fine,
*  that everyone's money was safe, that they shouldn't be in a panic anymore.
*  The short answer is interest rates.
*  Investors looked at these banks, they looked at how surprising Silicon Valley Bank was
*  in its failures to manage interest rate risk and they thought, why should we assume that
*  these other banks have done a better job than Silicon Valley Bank did?
*  And just as a reminder of what you told us last time, Silicon Valley Bank had invested
*  in things that looked really great when interest rates were low and looked a lot less great
*  when interest rates had risen over the past year and then decided it needed to sell those
*  investments off, which is what scared the bejesus out of investors because they lost
*  money on that sale.
*  That's right.
*  And it was malpractice to a certain extent by Silicon Valley Bank that they didn't take
*  into account that the Fed had this plan that they were executing, that they had been really
*  clear about to raise interest rates to counteract inflation.
*  And so basically the Biden administration came out and wanted to tell everybody, look,
*  it's fine, we've got this.
*  And it was almost like when a little kid falls over and they look to the adults to see how
*  the adults are reacting, whether they're going, oh no, oh no, or whether they're just like,
*  oh, you fell, it's okay, you know, to decide whether to cry.
*  The Biden administration wanted to say, it's fine, this was a little stumble.
*  The markets just weren't accepting that.
*  I mean, there was a wail that was coming out whether or not the adults in the room wanted
*  it to.
*  Got it.
*  And in this fascinating metaphor, the Biden administration is the parent who fails to
*  calm their kid and instead makes their kid freak out, in fact makes every kid on the
*  out by being so urgent in their response to the scraped knee that was Silicon Valley Bank's
*  bad decision making around interest rates.
*  These banks, we were told, did not pose systemic risk.
*  We were told that within the past five or six years, when regulators and Congress got
*  together and actually loosened regulations on these banks.
*  So if they weren't that big a deal and one of them could fail and it wouldn't bring down
*  the system, why did the administration come out and say that Silicon Valley Bank's depositors
*  all needed to be made whole?
*  Because it was a systemic risk if they were not.
*  I think that was a pretty big step.
*  And this was the way that markets reacted when they opened.
*  But is this underlying fear that the rising interest rate is a problem for all these regional
*  banks that are seeing their stock price go down?
*  Is it actually a reflection of bad decisions made by these banks around the interest rate
*  and real vulnerability?
*  Or is this just sort of irrational and fear making more fear?
*  Well the question that investors had to answer on Monday morning when the markets opened
*  was were they willing to bet their own money or their clients' money that there weren't
*  going to be any more problems among these regional banks caused by rising interest rates?
*  And they decided it's not a safe bet.
*  We're worried and we're going to express that worry.
*  And then on Tuesday, they got a little confirmation of this worry in the form of ratings agencies
*  coming out and saying, we too are reevaluating the security and stability of these regional
*  banks based on their management of interest rate risk.
*  Which is exactly the kind of signal that would make investors worry because they're suddenly
*  getting a rating agency, which is the kind of institution we all trust to tell us what's
*  what, saying we too are kind of worried about whether rising interest rates are bad for
*  these banks.
*  That's right.
*  And let me just take a moment though to make a very important note about these rating agencies.
*  It's up to investors, especially in this situation, to decide whether the ratings agencies are
*  identifying a real problem or just trying to cover their keisters.
*  These ratings agencies are supposed to be watching all of the entities that they're
*  providing ratings for really closely.
*  And so even the ratings agencies saying we're reevaluating, if you're a market participant,
*  you've got to figure out like how much weight to give that.
*  So just to be very clear, even though we know because this is what you told us that Silicon
*  Valley Bank failed not because interest rates went up, but because they didn't plan for
*  those interest rates going up in a prudent way.
*  And what happened to them, therefore, was fundamentally unique.
*  All these investors, they don't want to take that bet that Silicon Valley Bank situation
*  was unique.
*  Well, the ratings agency is giving them a reason to lean into their doubts and to sell
*  the stocks of your first republics and your Western alliances and so on.
*  This is all leading to a lot of investors getting pretty spooked.
*  That's right.
*  Even though there's not really any evidence that they should be spooked.
*  Not only is there not definitive evidence that they should be spooked, but the Fed and
*  the Biden administration are out there saying essentially it doesn't matter.
*  Whatever these banks are doing with their interest rate risk management, we're going
*  to work it out and we're going to make sure that they all can access enough cash at the
*  drop of a hat that they should be able to get through this.
*  That's the message that the financial regulators and the White House want people to come away
*  with.
*  Right.
*  So this is a whole lot of fallout for not a very good reason, which if you've covered
*  the financial markets, you kind of know is the very nature of investing.
*  That's right.
*  I mean, there's been kind of an outsized fallout from Silicon Valley Bank failing for what
*  is essentially bad management and specifically the decision to sell off an entire portfolio
*  of securities at a almost $2 billion loss and publicize that sale.
*  And what we recently learned is that the people who advised them to do that and to
*  publicize the fact that they had done it are getting paid or are charging at least $100
*  million for that advice.
*  That's Goldman Sachs.
*  Which seems to put an even finer point on the idea that what happened at Silicon Valley
*  Bank was unique based on what seems like uniquely bad advice and decisions.
*  And therefore, this is not really a risk to the whole system.
*  Yeah.
*  If you're an investor, you have to take all these different inputs, the government's reaction,
*  which is meant to reassure, but maybe actually is a signal of how bad things are or almost
*  were.
*  Everybody's in the marketplace trying to synthesize all of this stuff.
*  And what they decide to do is to pull back to say, I'm just not willing to bet my money
*  on everything being totally fine.
*  And that has real world effects in the market.
*  Right.
*  And it feels like one of the major real world effects in the market is a development that
*  is entirely unexpected by me at least, that happens this week.
*  And it happens not in the US, but over in Europe.
*  And that's what happens at Credit Suisse, this major bank based in Switzerland that
*  suddenly seems like it's in crisis.
*  So what the heck was happening there?
*  So let me walk you through it.
*  Credit Suisse has not been OK since basically the financial crisis.
*  They went through the crisis like everybody else kind of came out a little shaky, but
*  But then they made a bunch of really bad decisions and they just never really got back on solid
*  footing.
*  So that's the backdrop against which the American banking crisis starts to lead investors in
*  Europe to look at Credit Suisse again.
*  And when they do take that look, they see a couple of new things that while they're
*  kind of small, are problematic.
*  Such as?
*  The first one is that the Swiss financial regulator came out and said, we've found some
*  material weaknesses in Credit Suisse's accounting practices.
*  Not the hugest deal in the world, but when you're talking about a global financial market
*  in which an American bank has just shocked everyone by failing because of bad practices,
*  you're going to look at that with some more seriousness.
*  And then the other thing is a big investor in Credit Suisse was being interviewed and
*  he just kind of casually said he wasn't going to increase his stake in the bank any further.
*  And people took that as a sign of a loss of confidence when really it was just the investor
*  talking about his own strategy that didn't have to do with his views on whether the bank
*  was a good investment.
*  So without sort of really understanding it, people who had investments in Credit Suisse
*  basically said, oh my God, we need to rethink what we've been doing.
*  Got it.
*  So in a way, what's happening at Credit Suisse is just a measure of how hypersensitive and
*  fearful everyone is of what's happening over in the U.S.
*  Because in a lot of ways, what you're describing is not an analogous situation.
*  It's a pretty unique situation to Credit Suisse, just as it was a unique situation at Silicon
*  Valley Bank.
*  But people are making all kinds of scared linkages in their head.
*  I mean, nobody was going to tell you two weeks ago that Credit Suisse was the pillar of banking
*  practices and stability and the best investment ever.
*  But there's a different context now and there's a different tolerance for shenanigans.
*  And Credit Suisse has been trying to get its act together for so long that any little thing
*  is just going to set people off.
*  And that's what happened.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Emily, bring us up to where we are, because all of this is still playing out in a very
*  messy real time way.
*  So where are we right now?
*  So it's Thursday and things are calming down for Credit Suisse.
*  Investors are finally embracing the measures that the Swiss government took to help stabilize
*  the bank.
*  This week provided $54 billion in loans to the bank.
*  And it's a move that we can say worked because global stocks have reacted positively.
*  Another thing is that the European Central Bank raised interest rates today.
*  And that is really significant because there were people who were thinking that maybe this
*  turmoil, which has been attributed so much to rising interest rates here in the United
*  States, could basically cause the central banks around the world who have been acting
*  in some coordination to pause on the interest rate hikes.
*  And the European Central Bank signaled today that they're not going to let this stop their
*  agenda.
*  Got it.
*  So the message from the European banking system is when it comes to increasing interest rates,
*  to tame inflation, it's full steam ahead despite all these worries in the air that that has
*  been contributing to the financial mess over in the US with our banks.
*  Right.
*  However much market participants may want to complain about interest rates going up,
*  it's a signal that says nothing that has happened so far is bad enough that we need to go into
*  crisis mode and change our strategy here.
*  And what about here in the United States?
*  What is happening today?
*  So today turns out to be a big day for First Republic.
*  It has lost most of its stock value this week.
*  It got downgraded by ratings agencies.
*  And at the beginning of today, we thought the best thing that can happen to this bank
*  is that somebody else buys them.
*  And then later on Thursday, the federal government and the biggest banks announced that they're
*  putting $30 billion of deposits into First Republic.
*  These deposits are coming from the biggest banks, Bank of America, JP Morgan, and in
*  a deal brokered by the Treasury Department and the Fed, they're going to send these
*  deposits to First Republic in order to just express confidence in the bank, to stabilize
*  the bank and show its other customers that they don't have to go anywhere.
*  Which would be their way of kind of just getting out of this troubled moment.
*  Definitely.
*  It's something that these big banks can do easily.
*  They're essentially sending their own deposits to First Republic and just promising not to
*  yank them back right away.
*  And that way, First Republic can weather this.
*  And it's a win-win because it helps stabilize the whole system.
*  And hopefully it'll also help calm the stock market down.
*  Right.
*  Speaking of, I also noticed today that while all this is happening, the stock price of
*  the bigger banks in the U.S. like Bank of America, like JP Morgan, have been extremely
*  stable and in some cases have been going up a little bit.
*  And that makes me wonder, or maybe it makes me assume, that customers of these regional
*  banks who are spooked by what's happening there are taking their deposits and putting
*  them into these much bigger banks.
*  Is there evidence that that's been happening?
*  Well, let's just decouple the share price movement a little bit from what depositors are doing.
*  But I think that the story of the biggest banks looking very desirable right now is
*  a story that those banks are absolutely delighted to tell people.
*  Because this is kind of the first time since the financial crisis when being too big to
*  fail is a good thing.
*  But I also want to mention something, and this isn't just optics.
*  Bank of America, according to Bloomberg, who reported this citing anonymous sources, attracted
*  $15 billion in new deposits just this past week.
*  That means that they essentially benefited from these bank runs.
*  They have pledged $5 billion in deposits for First Republic.
*  So think about it.
*  It's pretty comfortable math for them.
*  Big banks have not always been the first choice for a lot of American businesses because they
*  don't treat their small and mid-sized corporate customers with as much high-touch attention
*  that the regional banks have been treating them with.
*  So there was like a real tangible reason why you didn't want to be the customer of the
*  biggest banks unless you were a huge company.
*  Now instead of the personal care that these companies were looking for, they just want
*  stability.
*  And they want to know that their money isn't going to go poof.
*  And that's a really simplistic way to put it because there are plenty of ways, if you're
*  a mid-sized company, to manage your cash so you don't get into the problems that the Silicon
*  Valley bank customers had or many of them.
*  Right.
*  And it makes sense that big banks would relish this storyline.
*  But I'm now wondering if we're witnessing, in a way, the kind of waning days of the regional
*  bank.
*  Is everything we're talking about here essentially an existential threat to the very idea of
*  our regional banking system?
*  That's a huge call to make.
*  And I don't think we're quite there yet.
*  First of all, the government, especially the Biden administration, does not want to see
*  smaller banks disappear.
*  I spoke with Maxine Waters of the House Financial Services Committee.
*  She's a congresswoman from California.
*  She's a Democrat.
*  And I asked her, what do you think should happen going forward?
*  And she said, I am not a fan of bank mergers.
*  I don't want this country to be a country that basically relies on four or five huge
*  banks.
*  And so I think you're going to see a lot of pushback to the idea that regional banks are
*  going away and that the big banks are going to step in.
*  Well, what did she say she fears if we lose regional banks, if Bank of America or Wells
*  Fargo buys up the regional banks?
*  Well, this is a position that many in Congress and in the Biden administration have held
*  for a long time.
*  They don't want to see the biggest banks become so dominant that they can start treating their
*  customers really terribly because their customers don't have any other options.
*  Right.
*  So the image we have of regional banks is that they're on the ground level, right?
*  That they have a personal connection to their clients.
*  They have dinner, perhaps, with their clients.
*  They sponsor local little league teams.
*  That's the idea that's at risk here.
*  Right.
*  I mean, we sort of have like small, medium and large for banks, community banks, which,
*  by the way, want to make sure everybody knows had nothing to do with this.
*  Those are the smallest.
*  Those are the smallest banks.
*  And then you've got your regional banks.
*  And they are not like the big banks in that they still have geographic knowledge and they
*  still have the ability to develop these close personal relationships with businesses that
*  are too small for the biggest banks to really care on the same level.
*  And that's even true for Silicon Valley Bank, which banked these startups, some of which
*  were absolutely tiny, you know, 10 people, 30 people.
*  That's a level of service that big banks don't provide and that made Silicon Valley Bank
*  a very important institution for these very small businesses.
*  Right.
*  And now that bank is gone.
*  So to summarize this, a week out, this is not feeling like a crisis that has been tied
*  off.
*  Quite the contrary.
*  Yep.
*  It's still an open question.
*  I think everybody's still really nervous and we're not going to see things calm down until
*  we kind of get some of the lingering problems off of our plate, whether it's the central
*  banks around the world showing even more clearly than they already started to today with the
*  ECB's interest rate hike, that they're still focused on inflation and they're not focused
*  on this.
*  First and foremost, I think that could be a signal for everybody to kind of like move
*  on.
*  But right now we have not moved on.
*  To be clear, though, there isn't a reason for a regular depositor of a bank to be worried
*  about the state of their money.
*  Right.
*  I mean, maybe this is going to sound a little bit like a PSA, but if you're somebody who
*  has money in most any bank in our country, it's generally pretty safe right now.
*  Definitely.
*  This is not a signal to anyone to move their money.
*  If you're a business with a lick of sense, you've already taken a lesson from what we
*  saw at the end of last week and you've called your banker and said, what are my options?
*  What can I do to feel more secure?
*  There are many options.
*  There are different things you can do with your money besides leave it in enormous amounts
*  in a bank account.
*  In addition to that, I think regulators are also alerted to the idea that interest rate
*  risk could be a problem for some of the other regional banks.
*  They're going to be taking these banks aside one by one and sitting down with them and
*  trying to figure out how to dissipate this risk and minimize it and just make sure that
*  the same fate that Silicon Valley Bank met doesn't happen to other banks.
*  The key here is for depositors to not continue to try to yank their money out of these banks.
*  Everyone who tries to do that is just going to make everything worse.
*  Right.
*  Emily, I want to turn to the next big event in this week long drama and that's next week
*  when the Federal Reserve Bank in the US is going to meet and talk about raising the US
*  interest rate yet again.
*  We've talked about the debate that's been playing out about whether rising interest rates
*  have contributed to the crisis we're in.
*  By many accounts, it has not really.
*  And the European Central Bank seemed to endorse that message when it raised interest rates
*  in Europe.
*  Do we think the Federal Reserve in the US is going to have the confidence to keep raising
*  interest rates as it has said it would?
*  Or is the reality that this banking crisis is going to make them think twice about doing
*  that?
*  Well, let me just start out by saying I'm not going to make a prediction about whether
*  the Fed's going to raise rates because I don't know.
*  But if the Fed decides not to raise interest rates at all, I think that's going to be a
*  signal that they think things are really bad.
*  And that could get back to the situation where, you know, the kid falls over and looks to
*  the adults to see whether to cry and the adults are flipping out.
*  So interesting.
*  Right.
*  I think that if I had to put my money anywhere, I'd probably put it on another rate hike.
*  Whether the Fed decides to kind of make a nuanced decision and make that rate hike a
*  little smaller than they were going to, I don't know.
*  I mean, even that would be a big signal.
*  So we just have to wait and see.
*  Right.
*  Because that would suggest the Federal Reserve needs to make a huge correction in this program
*  it's been up to for a year of raising interest rates to lower inflation, which is a real
*  problem in our economy.
*  So if the Fed does change course, that would suggest they're freaked out, which could
*  in turn freak everyone else out all over again.
*  And we know that that's not what they want.
*  That's absolutely right.
*  The government's mission here is really delicate and really complex.
*  They have to continue to carry out their stated plan for managing the economy and inflation
*  and take this moment into account without freaking people out all over again.
*  And that's going to be a really tough needle to thread.
*  Emily, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  It's a pleasure.
*  The Federal Reserve is expected to announce whether or not it will raise interest rates
*  when its leaders meet in Washington on Wednesday.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron pushed through legislation to raise the retirement
*  age for most workers from 62 to 64 without a vote of lawmakers in the National Assembly
*  who were poised to defeat it.
*  The decision inflamed an already tense confrontation between Macron and the legislature where shortly
*  after, angry lawmakers banged on their desks and sent a defiant rendition of the French
*  national anthem.
*  Macron's move set the stage for members of the Assembly to hold a no-confidence vote
*  against his government in the coming days.
*  And Poland now says it will send four fighter jets to Ukraine to be used in its war against
*  Russia, a move that until now no NATO country has been willing to make for fear of provoking
*  Russian retaliation.
*  Even so, the plane's Russian-made MiG fighter jets fall short of Ukraine's requests for
*  more advanced F-16 fighter jets from the U.S., which the Biden administration has so far
*  refused to send.
