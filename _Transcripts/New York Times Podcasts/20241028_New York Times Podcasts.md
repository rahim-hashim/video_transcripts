# The Trump Campaign’s Big Gamble
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsm78KiRyW8)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams, and this is The Daily.
*  The presidential campaign is in its final week, and one thing still remains true.
*  The election is probably going to come down to just a handful of voters in a few swing
*  states.
*  Today, my colleagues Jessica Chung and Jonathan Swan take us inside Donald Trump's unorthodox
*  campaign to win over those voters.
*  It's Monday, October 28th.
*  Prevailing wisdom in American politics dictates that the ground game matters, things like
*  door knocking, phone banking, and getting out the vote.
*  But in a race that looks as tight as the 2024 presidential election, the ground game can
*  be the difference between winning and losing.
*  The Harris campaign has been running a really traditional and extremely well-funded ground
*  operation.
*  It has paid staff members and armies of canvassers who are all focused on turning out every single
*  voter they can find.
*  The Trump campaign, on the other hand, they've got a totally different approach.
*  First of all, they've got less money and less paid staff, so it's a smaller ground operation.
*  Some of the get out the vote work has been taken on by outside groups, like Elon Musk's
*  Super PAC.
*  And the actual field offices, they're leaning a lot more heavily on volunteers.
*  To get a sense of what this effort looks like inside one of those offices, we sent
*  daily producer Jessica Chung to a key place in a key swing state, Maricopa County, Arizona.
*  It's the most populous county in the state where more than half of all of Arizona's
*  voters live.
*  Trump won it in 2016, and then Biden eeked out a victory there in 2020.
*  Here's Jess.
*  You want to speak for Maricopa County?
*  Yes.
*  The office of the Maricopa County Republican Party is just southeast of Phoenix.
*  It sits on a quiet street in an anonymous looking office park next to a tiling company.
*  I got there on a Tuesday afternoon.
*  Hi, you must be Craig.
*  Yes, how are you?
*  Hi, nice to meet you.
*  I'm Jess.
*  Craig Berland is the chair of the Maricopa County Republican Committee.
*  He has all the businessman staples, warm smile, tidy suit, wire-rimmed glasses, handshake
*  firm, but not too firm.
*  Go upstairs?
*  Yes.
*  Or maybe like a little tour, too.
*  We go upstairs, and Craig starts to show me around.
*  Oh, so this is new.
*  This is pretty new.
*  Oh, where were you guys before?
*  We didn't have a place.
*  Oh, wow.
*  We basically bummed around.
*  The Maricopa Republicans just moved here in May, but they've really made this place their
*  own.
*  First of all, I don't know if you noticed when you walked in, but all the windows outside
*  are mirrored, and the American and Arizona flag are mirrored in all the windows as you're
*  walking in.
*  Once you get inside, this place might look like any random office space, were it not
*  for the decor, which is festively Trump.
*  A lot of it's Trump-related.
*  At the top of the steps, there's a life-size cardboard cutout of the former president with
*  Melania.
*  In the lobby, there's a large screen TV with Trump giving a speech.
*  There's red balloons all over.
*  And there are portraits.
*  Lincoln, Reagan, Frederick Douglass, and Trump.
*  And there's merch.
*  Tons of merch.
*  There's all kinds of t-shirts and hats.
*  Craig points to a glass conference room that's been repurposed to what he refers to as a
*  Trump store.
*  It's stuffed with racks of shirts.
*  And there are flags that say God, guns, and guts.
*  But there's also some men's rings, and I think there's an $800 pair of golden tennis
*  shoes in there.
*  And I imagine the proceeds would go to the county office.
*  It helps us, yeah.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  These days, Craig says he's here 50 hours a week, fundraising, planning events, and
*  helping to direct, according to him, more than a thousand volunteers who come here to
*  elect Republicans.
*  In this close election, Arizona is a big deal.
*  Polls show it could be very close again.
*  And just to remind you, when Biden won the state in 2020, he won by less than 11,000
*  votes.
*  That was out of more than 3 million votes cast.
*  In a place like this, efforts to get voters to the polls could be the difference between
*  winning and losing.
*  And to understand what this office is doing and its mission in these critical final days,
*  it's helpful to know the story of how Craig ended up here.
*  I grew up in Kansas in a very small farming and oil country.
*  Craig was a small town kid turned businessman.
*  He worked for General Motors.
*  And eventually, he moved his family to Arizona, where he started an aerospace company.
*  Yeah, it was like mini Americans, right?
*  Your head's down.
*  You know, you got payroll to make, you got new quotes to make, you got product to ship.
*  Craig says he would vote Republican, but that was pretty much the extent of his political
*  involvement until 2020.
*  Well, I didn't like what happened in the 2020 election.
*  I remember sitting there in our family room, switching from one station to the next, and
*  then getting my phone out and looking for the New York Times or somebody to see what
*  the counts of ballots were and what was left and mentally doing math.
*  If you forgot, during the 2020 election, Maricopa County was ground zero for an ugly fight over
*  alleged election fraud.
*  It started on election night.
*  I can say that when we became very concerned is when all of a sudden counting started shutting
*  down at many states, right?
*  You know, it was Atlanta and it was Detroit and you're going, that's never happened
*  before.
*  What's going on?
*  Craig is referring to an allegation from 2020 that some battleground states where Donald
*  Trump was ahead decided to stop counting in order to prevent him from winning.
*  This idea took off on Facebook among his supporters who were suspicious of the voting system.
*  For the record, this theory has been thoroughly debunked.
*  In Atlanta, counting was only paused briefly after a pipe burst on election day.
*  And election officials in other states said they never stopped counting votes, including
*  as Craig alleged in Detroit.
*  But for Craig, he wasn't buying it.
*  You know, we were all sitting there at night and we seen that the candidates that we thought
*  should win were winning.
*  And then in the middle of the night, the voting stopped.
*  And when it restarted again, there was this shift.
*  And I guess because of my engineering mind and the way I've been trained is that curve
*  is not something that you see in nature.
*  That's not a natural curve.
*  Early results that night misleadingly suggested that Trump was bound for victory.
*  That could have been because Republican votes tended to dominate in rural areas, small towns
*  where counting goes faster.
*  And during the pandemic in 2020, Democrats tended to cast far more mail-in ballots, which
*  get counted later.
*  Was it because at a certain point they started to count the mail-in ballots, which lean more
*  Democrat in certain counties?
*  Yeah.
*  Here in Arizona, we've had mail-in ballots for a long time.
*  I didn't perceive as that should have been the reason.
*  Neither Craig nor his wife trusted the explanations they were hearing.
*  You know, we both thought that something was awfully wrong and we thought we needed to
*  be more involved.
*  For Craig, more involvement first, joining We the People AZ Alliance, a far-right activist
*  group.
*  Then he joined the county party and eventually he was elected chair of that party.
*  And to this day, do you still believe that Maricopa County actually went for Trump in
*  2020?
*  Despite many processes of verification, including a Florida firm had done a hand recount and
*  found that there was actually like 300 more votes for Biden than the previous count.
*  So I wonder where your beliefs are now.
*  That's a complicated question.
*  My intuition tells me that Trump won Arizona.
*  And do I have proof of that?
*  No.
*  But what I do have is I do have proof that there was many, many, many, many ballots in
*  Maricopa County that were counted that shouldn't have been legally.
*  So how do I have that proof?
*  So here we go back.
*  The year before Craig became party chair, he helped lead a review of signatures on mail-in
*  ballots in Maricopa County and is convinced that 10% of the mail-in ballots counted in
*  2020 should not have been.
*  And that's because he claims the signatures on those ballots did not adequately match
*  those on file.
*  A claim experts say is based on incomplete signature history and a flawed methodology.
*  But it's still something he's very fixated on.
*  I'm telling you Craig's whole story because as soon as you start talking to others in
*  the Maricopa County office, you start to realize how many people there are just like Craig.
*  I started volunteering after a 2020 election.
*  I wanted to find out why my vote didn't count.
*  I spent about two hours talking to volunteers who were phone banking.
*  I was completely apolitical.
*  I was new.
*  I had never, never volunteered in politics before.
*  And then it was after the 2020 election was stolen, then it was like, okay, you've got
*  to be more engaged.
*  And it was at that point that I decided that I wanted my grandkids' votes to count.
*  People told me they believed Trump won in 2020, the election was stolen, and they were
*  here to fix what they think is a broken system.
*  I like finding out what was happening.
*  This is my patriotic chore.
*  My purpose is to do my part to honor God and my country by being here to help do what
*  I can in Maricopa County.
*  I think we have a nickname for it.
*  It's actually Maricopa Corruption County.
*  Oh, Maricopa Corruption County.
*  Is that what people call it here?
*  Some people do because there's a lot of that.
*  Volunteer after volunteer told me that in the years since Trump lost the election, they
*  got involved.
*  Some signed up to work the midterm election.
*  A lot of them had volunteered for the mail-in battle review that Craig helped lead in 2022.
*  And based on everything they've done and seen, they've only grown more suspicious.
*  I was actually looking at the depth of the dot because you could tell if a dot had any
*  kind of weight to it.
*  The ovals being filled in absolutely perfect, like a dot matrix printer.
*  I wasn't told, hey, this is what we think.
*  Just here, do this.
*  And all the volunteers that I managed through the course of that project walked away with,
*  oh, my fucking God.
*  All these ideas that the 2020 election was somehow stolen from Trump aren't new, of course.
*  They're in the ether of Republican politics all the way up to Trump himself.
*  That's true even though they've been widely disproven with scores of lawsuits over alleged
*  election fraud thrown out.
*  There's ample evidence that there was no widespread voter fraud in 2020.
*  Government officials, including Republicans, have assured people that election systems
*  are secure.
*  But it's important to understand theories of a stolen election are why so many people
*  are here.
*  It's their motivation.
*  How many hours have you devoted to volunteering this election season?
*  Probably around 35 hours a week.
*  I do at least four to six every day.
*  Four to six hours every day?
*  Yes, including Saturday.
*  I give about 50, between 50 and 60 hours a week.
*  Their beliefs in a stolen election aren't just driving them to spend all this time here.
*  They're affecting how they're spending that time here.
*  I'm late because I was walking neighborhoods handing out golden tickets.
*  And just to say, in this office, people are spending time doing the traditional things.
*  Calling voters, knocking on doors, asking people how they're going to get to the polls.
*  They are doing those things.
*  But a traditional campaign would be leisure-focused on that.
*  And in this office, the attention is split.
*  Because Craig and his volunteers are doing a lot of other things.
*  While we were walking around, Craig pointed out this one conference room.
*  We have some legal representations.
*  We kept an office there and there's war boards wrapped around the walls.
*  War boards?
*  War.
*  War boards.
*  What are war boards?
*  The military will say, we're going to go into the war room and prepare for whatever's happening.
*  We picked it up as a war room, war board.
*  Yeah, it's just a slang.
*  Yeah.
*  Craig says in that room, among all the things they're doing, they're spending time on what
*  they call election integrity.
*  That has included training a huge number of volunteers to observe polling places.
*  And in fact, Republicans say they have a record number of poll watchers this election.
*  As we keep walking, Craig points to another room.
*  We do have one person that takes care of our servers and our data.
*  They're massive data.
*  We collect video and we're monitoring stuff.
*  We get from the state the voter registration files and we keep those up to date.
*  We're monitoring those and doing comparisons.
*  Oh, wow.
*  So that's a huge hard drive you have.
*  Millions of records, not thousands.
*  Craig says all these computer server systems have been set up to store all types of records
*  and files related to election integrity.
*  We have a full blown server room.
*  Right.
*  So we have big server banks with very large servers in there recording video recording
*  of cameras that are on 24 hours a day.
*  I'm monitoring outside drop boxes all the time.
*  So we need to pull something up from last year.
*  We've got it.
*  Also among those records are voter registration files.
*  Remember that mail-in ballot review that Craig and some of these volunteers were a part of
*  when they went in and compared signatures from ballots to voter registration files to
*  see if the signatures were a match.
*  The whole reason they came to believe that 10% of the mail-in ballots in 2020 should
*  not have been counted.
*  Well this year they have every intention to be in those files again, asking volunteers,
*  just regular citizens, to scrutinize voter signatures and maybe even challenge them.
*  You can imagine all the ways that citizens looking for suspicious activity or raising
*  questions about signatures could affect this election.
*  It could delay things.
*  Perfectly valid votes could get challenged.
*  It could be chaotic.
*  Or it could add up to a big waste of their time.
*  There are lots of possibilities.
*  No matter how it goes, all this focus on what they consider election integrity takes resources
*  away from the traditional work of a campaign office.
*  Spend on efforts like this are resources not spent on getting out the vote.
*  You can also imagine that all the skepticism about elections could hurt voter outreach.
*  Do you worry by talking more about election integrity that it might actually create more
*  distrust?
*  Yeah.
*  Well that's an Achilles heel.
*  And you know it's not without merit.
*  A lot of voters right now that didn't vote in 22 didn't vote because they did not trust
*  the election system to count their vote.
*  I said, well why should I vote?
*  If there's going to be a cheat, why should I vote?
*  And it's difficult sometimes to really convince people that it's absolutely critical to vote.
*  It's difficult because they're encouraging people to vote at the exact same time they're
*  telling people their vote might not count.
*  So given these two things, I asked Craig what he wants Republican voters to do.
*  And his advice is a little confusing.
*  Our message is if you get a mail-in ballot, the number one priority is vote it.
*  What we'd like to see you do is go in on election day, turn in your, spoil your mail-in ballot
*  and vote in person.
*  That's the best.
*  And you run through the tabulator and you're done.
*  But if you don't do that, then at least turn it in.
*  And we don't want you to turn it in late.
*  Just to be clear, Craig has been telling people to vote in person.
*  And if they can't do that, he wants them to take their mail-in ballot to the polls and
*  use it as a guide to vote in person.
*  And if they can't do that, only as a last resort, mail it in.
*  Do you worry that that might actually confuse people or like a voter might say that's a
*  lot of hoops to jump through.
*  I don't want to think about it.
*  I'm just not going to vote.
*  Well, yeah, the one thing we would leave them with is vote.
*  No matter what you do, vote.
*  That's the number one priority is vote.
*  You have to exercise your right to vote.
*  Before I left the Maricopa County Republican offices, I asked Craig if all of this was
*  the right approach or whether he wishes he didn't have to do any of this, that he could
*  just focus on getting votes out and winning.
*  Craig sees it differently because he says he genuinely believes the election was stolen
*  last time.
*  So to him, this is part of winning.
*  You're doing exactly what they should be doing.
*  And the effort he says is huge.
*  After the break, my colleague, Jonathan Swan, makes sense of what we saw in Maricopa County
*  and explains how it fits into Trump's strategy to win the election.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Jonathan, hi.
*  Great to have you here.
*  Hi, Rachel.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  We do cover Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
*  My colleague who is a daily producer, Jess Chung, she went out to Trump's field office
*  in Maricopa County in Arizona recently.
*  What she found was this operation that, at least on the surface, seemed a little bit
*  scrambled.
*  There was, of course, the regular campaigning stuff.
*  There was the door knocking, the phone banking, all of that.
*  But then there was this whole other piece that was focused on election integrity.
*  That felt like it was taking up a surprising amount of time and energy.
*  And in a lot of ways, it actually felt like the animating force behind why a lot of volunteers
*  had come out in the first place.
*  And so I guess my question for you is, what do you make of that?
*  And is that what the Trump campaign field office is supposed to be focused on right
*  now?
*  Well, this all flows from the top.
*  This is Donald Trump.
*  Let me just give you a little flavor of how he thinks about the race, because I think
*  it's really important to understand when you see something like this in Maricopa County,
*  it's not an accident.
*  It's something that has flowed down from Donald Trump, and not just over the last few months,
*  but really over the last three and a half years.
*  When Donald Trump talks about the election in private, something he often says to his
*  advisors is, don't worry about getting people to vote.
*  I'll take care of that.
*  What you need to take care of is stopping Democrats from stealing the election, stopping
*  them from cheating.
*  The message Trump gave to his new chairman, Michael Watley from North Carolina, was your
*  mission number one, two and three is to quote unquote, stop the steal.
*  Trump didn't really want to hear about anything else.
*  So while it's true that his campaign is doing many traditional things, it's not that Trump
*  doesn't want them doing any of that.
*  But the thing that animates Trump most of all is this notion he has in his head, which
*  I should say is completely baseless.
*  There is no evidence that Democrats stole the last election, and Trump's team was comprehensively
*  defeated in court many, many times trying to prove his case.
*  But what he tells his team in private is you need to stop Democrats from cheating.
*  I will take care of turning voters out.
*  But don't those two things kind of work against each other?
*  When Jess went to Maricopa County, she was hearing about how Trump supporters were feeling
*  kind of deflated.
*  Why would we bother voting in a rigged system?
*  So this constant stop the steal, stop the steal, does that have a depressing effect
*  on turnout?
*  Well, it definitely could.
*  There are a lot of Republican strategists who felt that that's exactly what happened
*  in the Georgia runoff elections after the 2020 election, which Republicans lost, which
*  is Trump basically went to the state and said, they stole the election, everything's rigged,
*  etc., etc.
*  Well, ergo, why would I bother voting if Democrats are just going to steal it?
*  Trump has kind of altered that message a little bit.
*  And he said, you know, we need to go out in such large numbers that they can't possibly
*  steal it from us.
*  What's that Trump slogan that's trying to thread the needle on this?
*  Too big to rig?
*  Yeah.
*  And I think swamp the vote is the other one.
*  Basically the idea is we need to vote in such decisive numbers that it's too big for them
*  to steal.
*  I want to turn back to something you said earlier, which was that Trump basically told
*  his advisors, don't worry about the votes.
*  I will bring out the votes.
*  And that sort of suggests to me that he's actually not relying on these field offices
*  like in Maricopa County to get people out to the polls.
*  He thinks that he can drive them to the polls.
*  So what is his strategy to do that?
*  To make it, as he put it, too big to rig?
*  I think what's sometimes hard for people to absorb when they think about Trump and his
*  campaign is Trump's own theory of the case, as he articulates it often, privately and
*  publicly, is absurd.
*  Trump's theory of the case is if it's a quote unquote fair election, if there's no cheating,
*  I'll win everywhere.
*  I'll win New York.
*  I'll win California.
*  Et cetera, et cetera.
*  He doesn't just say that publicly.
*  He also says it privately.
*  I have no idea what he believes in his heart of hearts, but that's what he says.
*  So you have this fairly absurd theory of the case, if you can even call it that.
*  And then overlaid on top of that is a sophisticated campaign operation, which is running a smart
*  and targeted campaign focused on a really small sliver of voters.
*  The undecideds.
*  Yeah.
*  The campaign sees the electorate the way they've modeled it right now, that there's only about
*  five percent of voters that they think remain truly undecided and a couple, maybe a couple
*  extra percent of voters that maybe soft, calmer supporters that they see as movable.
*  They're 59 percent male.
*  They're young.
*  About half are under the age of 45.
*  And these are not political people.
*  They're heavily independent and they're more pessimistic about the economy than the electorate
*  writ large.
*  And they're more concerned about inflation and everything they're doing from the campaign
*  headquarters is targeted at turning out that group.
*  How willing is Trump to take direction from his campaign?
*  In many cases, he is taking direction from his campaign.
*  He's traveling to where they say he needs to travel and where their data tells him that
*  he needs to travel.
*  And he's caught in the exact same voters that they've identified as these persuadable voters.
*  Good evening, everyone.
*  My name is Dana White.
*  I am the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.
*  You know, he's formed this really vital partnership with the UFC, the Ultimate Fighting Championship.
*  His friend Dana White runs that.
*  Donald championed the UFC before it was popular, before it grew into a successful business.
*  And I will always be grateful.
*  Trump has this whole choreographed routine where he shows up to fights with his own entrance
*  song.
*  45 being ushered in by UFC CEO Dana White.
*  Donald Trump.
*  Crowd goes wild.
*  That's a media event in and of itself.
*  And they are happy to share this moment with the former president Donald Trump here tonight.
*  And there's this whole world of podcasts with these male comedians who are open to him.
*  Last time we had you on, it was our biggest episode ever, obviously.
*  7 million views in 24 hours.
*  It was crushing, going viral.
*  It did really hit.
*  It was a big monster, wasn't it?
*  Huge.
*  And he has these long conversations with them, one, two hour conversations.
*  I feel like we need you back right now.
*  Like we need you back in office.
*  I feel like you're the only one right now that can really fix the problems here and
*  abroad.
*  Well, it's really nice that you say that.
*  I appreciate it.
*  He's talking to people like the Nelk Boys.
*  Today's guest is the 45th president of the United States of America.
*  And he's currently running for president on the Republican ticket.
*  People like Theo Vaughan.
*  Hello, everybody.
*  Welcome to Flay Drink.
*  We are sitting down with Mr. President.
*  Mr. President, thank you so much for being here.
*  Andrew Schultz.
*  You know, there's a whole lot of them that he does.
*  And it's this sort of bro culture.
*  They talk about sports.
*  They talk about football.
*  They talk about golf.
*  And it's a non-political audience.
*  And Trump is really at home in those interviews.
*  Yeah, does Barron play sports or anything?
*  He does.
*  He plays golf and different sports.
*  Soccer.
*  Loves soccer.
*  Very good at soccer.
*  He's a good athlete, Barron.
*  Yeah.
*  So when you listen to them, you know, he gets to basically just in this very comfortable
*  setting, just riff and joke and talk about a mixture of like personal family stuff with,
*  you know, how terrible Democrats are and how they're destroying the country.
*  She was considered the worst vice president in the history of our country.
*  So you know, that's what he's been doing.
*  And it's been reaching really large audiences of these people that they need to turn out.
*  So even though Trump thinks that he's so popular, he doesn't really need to do much to sweep
*  the election if they're free and fair, as he said, he's still mostly showing up and
*  doing the things his campaign is directing him to do.
*  So look, you have this dichotomy where on one hand, Trump's campaign is very data driven.
*  The podcasts appearances that he's doing may look very sort of loose and rambling, etc.
*  But behind them is real data showing that this is where you need to be to reach these
*  young men.
*  But on the other hand, Trump is running to some extent, a very gut driven campaign.
*  And in some areas, following his gut over the data, the very clear data that's being
*  presented to him by his campaign officials.
*  And the clearest example of that is immigration.
*  Donald Trump has been given data by his advisors, both public and private data showing unequivocally
*  that the economy is the most important issue to the voters he needs to reach in inflation.
*  When Donald Trump disagrees, he feels at a gut level that immigration and the border
*  is the issue that motivates people more than any other issue.
*  And he believes that's why he won the election in 2016.
*  And so he's returning to that with his emphasis in this election.
*  As we rebuild our economy, we will also restore our borders, if you don't mind.
*  And you sort of had this moment recently in Atlanta, where Trump, he turns his back to
*  the crowd and they play this video.
*  Open borders, deadly consequences.
*  Border crisis.
*  Record high crossings are putting a strain on cities across America.
*  This montage of just horrific crimes being committed by undocumented immigrants.
*  My 20 year old daughter, Kayla Hamilton, was murdered in her own room.
*  Kayla's murderer was apprehended by border patrol, crossing illegally into the U.S.
*  And Trump turns around and he says, immigration is the number one issue.
*  That beats it all out to me.
*  It's not even close.
*  The United States is now...
*  That beats it out.
*  It's not even close.
*  That's basically a public iteration of a private conversation that Donald Trump has been having
*  with his advisors for weeks.
*  So it's not like he's not talking about the economy.
*  He's doing a ton of economy themed events at his advisors behest.
*  And he's doing economy focused interviews.
*  So it's not that he's not talking about it.
*  And certainly their paid advertising has been talking a lot about it.
*  There has been a disagreement between campaigns data and Trump's gut.
*  And Trump is going with his gut in terms of his emphasis of immigration.
*  You know, it really feels like people are often overestimating Trump or underestimating
*  Trump.
*  Like either they think that he's some kind of marketing genius who knows exactly how
*  to connect with people when he follows his gut.
*  Or they think he's like a delusional narcissist who only acts out of impulse or self interest.
*  And when you look at this campaign, I feel like it might be hard to tell whether you
*  think that some of these tactics are genius or insane or both.
*  What do you make of it when you look at it?
*  It's pretty hard to make any declarations about this until we see the election results.
*  And even after then, there's going to be this always happens.
*  The winning campaign, everything they did was genius.
*  And then the losing campaign or just a bunch of idiots.
*  And the truth is that neither is necessarily true.
*  I think the campaign and Trump have made some pretty significant bets in this election.
*  And those bets will either prove to be really smart or fatally flawed.
*  What I will say is that the bets they've made in some cases are bets of necessity.
*  I'll just give you one example.
*  They have made a huge bet that they will turn out people who don't usually vote.
*  That will either be a spectacular success or these people who like Trump or lean
*  towards Trump may not bother to vote or they may not have the ground operation
*  that is effective enough to get those people to the polls.
*  And that's a bet.
*  But I'm not sure what else they could do.
*  It's not like you'd send Donald Trump around to go to a bunch of Whole Foods in
*  you know, North Arlington and talk to all the mums there and say, hey, you know,
*  I'm going to be your protector.
*  You know, as he's been saying, I'll be the protector of women.
*  It's, you know, I don't know how much room Donald Trump has to move with suburban
*  women, for example.
*  So yes, it's a bet.
*  It's a gamble.
*  But they're working with what they've got.
*  The candidate is the candidate they've got.
*  It's not like the views about Donald Trump are hugely malleable at this point.
*  They're just going where they're fishing where the fish are.
*  And we'll see.
*  Maybe they didn't have the infrastructure in place to pull this off.
*  But I think based on the electorate as it is, it's pretty hard to argue with their
*  strategy, I would say.
*  You know, this whole conversation and looking at the difference between the
*  Harris campaign and the Trump campaign, you've got this one traditional, well
*  funded, well oiled machine and this other one that looks very nontraditional.
*  And it's such an incredibly close race.
*  And as you said, like, we're not going to really know much about what worked and
*  what didn't work until after the election.
*  So it just keeps reminding me of that great quote from the screenwriter, William
*  Goldman, nobody knows anything.
*  And he's talking about the movie business and he's saying nobody really knows
*  what's going to work, how to pick a hit.
*  But I keep thinking about that quote on this campaign.
*  Like, does anybody actually know what will win this election?
*  I mean, the short answer is no.
*  I mean, you talk to anyone on either side and they will tell you the data indicate
*  this is as close a presidential election as they've ever seen, a true jump ball
*  election. And it's going to be decided if the data is correct, maybe we're seeing
*  we'll have another polling error like we have the last two times Trump's been on
*  the ballot. But if the data are correct, you know, you're going to have again,
*  these states decided by potentially tens of thousands of votes.
*  And when that's the case, any factor, you could pick out any factor as decisive.
*  When you're talking about these kind of tiny wafer thin margins, you know, anything
*  could could end up being the decisive factor.
*  Jonathan, thank you very much.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  With only days left before the election, both candidates made their final push
*  with voters over the weekend.
*  Kamala Harris traveled to Houston for a rally on Friday, then went to Kalamazoo,
*  Michigan on Saturday, and finally to Philadelphia on Sunday, where she spent
*  her time politicking throughout the city, including visits to a church, a
*  barbershop, a bookstore and a restaurant before taking the stage at a rally.
*  And we must not wake up the day after the election.
*  We must not wake up the day after the election and have any regrets about what
*  we could have done in these next nine days.
*  And giving a speech aimed at mobilizing supporters in this final stretch.
*  So let's spend these next nine days knowing we did everything we could.
*  For his part, Donald Trump also traveled to Michigan and Pennsylvania for
*  campaign events over the weekend, but spent Sunday night in his hometown,
*  New York City, where he hosted a rally at Madison Square Garden.
*  And I just want to say a very big hello to a special place, New York, and to an
*  incredible arena, Madison Square Garden.
*  Incredible.
*  What was meant as a closing argument for Trump that featured TV personalities,
*  entertainers and other notable voices from the right, evolved into a carnival of
*  grievances, misogyny and racism.
*  Several of the speakers made crude and inflammatory remarks about Puerto
*  Ricans, Palestinians, Jews, Hispanics, and even a black man in the audience.
*  Trump himself referenced remarks he's made recently about how the greatest
*  threat America faces is, quote, the enemy from within.
*  The rally was a capstone for an increasingly aggrieved campaign for Donald
*  Trump, whose rhetoric has grown darker and more menacing.
*  And Israel launched a retaliatory strike on Iran early Saturday, about three
*  weeks after Iran fired waves of ballistic missiles at Israel.
*  The latest strikes marked a new escalation between the two archrivals,
*  although they appeared designed to stop short of all-out war.
*  Israel avoided striking nuclear sites that the Biden administration had
*  warned against hitting and instead targeted military facilities.
*  Saturday also marked the first time that Israel has acknowledged conducting a
*  military operation inside Iran.
