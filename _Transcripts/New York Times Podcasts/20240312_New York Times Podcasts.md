# Oregon Decriminalized Drugs. Voters Now Regret It.
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jkr5J8quMA)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bolvaro. This is The Daily.
*  Three years ago, Oregon became the first state in the country to decriminalize the possession
*  of hard drugs. Now, they're about to reverse course. Today, my colleague Mike Baker on
*  what went wrong. It's Tuesday, March 12th. Mike, I want to begin with how and why the
*  state of Oregon ever decided to decriminalize hard drugs, the decision that really sets
*  this entire story into motion. Yeah, I mean, if we go back five years ago,
*  just before the pandemic, we can all remember the opioid crisis that was spreading across
*  the country. Oregon, on its own, was really struggling. Drug overdoses had been rising
*  at quite an alarming rate. The state ranked among the worst in access to drug treatment
*  at the time. As we know, arrest and jail have been a central strategy to combating
*  drugs for decades. For people in Oregon, they're looking around saying, this has not been working.
*  That model is broken. It's time for a new path. One of the options that began to emerge
*  was is it time to decriminalize these drugs and focus on treatment? There was already
*  a roadmap that suggested decriminalization could work. Just explain that.
*  If you remember, Washington State and Colorado in 2012 legalized the recreational use of
*  marijuana. Oregon legalized it shortly after in 2014. The states that followed that path,
*  they found a lot of success. They could get more tax revenue. They could reprioritize
*  their law enforcement resources. They could deal with racial disparities that had been
*  in the system for decades. There were a range of benefits all without the sort of doomsday
*  scenarios that a lot of people had predicted would happen.
*  The sky did not at all fall as some had feared when pot was decriminalized in any of these states.
*  Now, it's spread across the country. About half of states have legalized marijuana. Obviously,
*  pot is not an opioid. Opioids are much harder drugs. At a fundamental level, the motivation
*  here is still the same. Jail is not the answer. People started to really coalesce around this
*  idea. It's a progressive state. Advocates saw a pathway to develop a plan and put it
*  on the ballot for voters to consider. That's how in 2020 we found ourselves with this ballot
*  initiative, Measure 110.
*  Tell us about Measure 110. What's in it, exactly?
*  The thrust of the measure is really to focus on stop treating drug addiction as a crime
*  and start treating it as a health issue. There are two parts of the plan. On one side, you
*  would decriminalize possession of small amounts of drugs, not an amount that maybe a dealer
*  might carry. That would be decriminalizing things like heroin and cocaine and fentanyl.
*  On the other hand of the initiative, you'd have these long overdue investments, hundreds
*  of millions of dollars in building out drug treatment services that the state had really
*  been lacking.
*  As proposed, what happens when authorities in Oregon come across an addict who possesses
*  a small amount of cocaine or fentanyl, for example? What's the envisioned process?
*  If an officer comes across someone on the sidewalk using a drug, the goal was for that
*  officer to not arrest but to issue a citation with a $100 fine. Instead of sending that
*  person to jail, they could avoid that fine by calling a phone number, getting a health
*  assessment and potentially being directed into a treatment program that would serve
*  them.
*  The thinking is nobody is going to want to pay that $100 fine, so somebody will instead
*  call that number and enter this pipeline for treatment.
*  Right. A small penalty, a big funnel to get people into treatment. At the same time, there's
*  a ton of funding available to make this happen because the plan takes cannabis tax revenue
*  that the state has been collecting and directs it into building out this treatment.
*  Hmm. In a sense, one form of decriminalization of pot finances the cost of decriminalizing
*  the other, which is hard drugs.
*  You got it. There's a lot of money behind the effort and there's also a lot of powerful
*  people. The Drug Policy Alliance, which was a reform group backed by billionaire George
*  Soros, contributed millions of dollars to lead the effort. The initiative also won funding
*  from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan. It was winning big
*  endorsements left and right. Everyone from the ACLU to the State Democratic Party to
*  the Oregon Nurses Association. And in Portland, the local district attorney Mike Schmidt,
*  the prosecutor who would handle drug crimes in the city, he comes out and says, you know,
*  I think what we've been doing clearly has failed. He's also in favor of Measure 110.
*  Wow. Let's try something different. There was really sort of a groundswell of support
*  that was building as the year went on. And in November 2020.
*  And a first in the nation in Oregon. Oregon voters passed a groundbreaking drug law reform.
*  Ballot Measure 110 passes with 58% of the vote.
*  I think this is a good thing because way too many people get locked up in America for way
*  too long. I mean, I view Oregon as a very important and I'll say necessary lab experiment.
*  So let's all watch. I mean, it's worth saying this moment is kind of a revolution in America's
*  relationship to hard drugs. Absolutely. One advocate said that night that
*  the results were like taking a sledgehammer to the cornerstone of the drug war. They really
*  envisioned that point that this was going to be the start of a wave of legislation across
*  the country. The first of many states to do this.
*  Right. They envisioned movement in Washington state and Vermont and Maine and DC and then
*  building up momentum towards an eventual ballot initiative in California. This was the start
*  of a new wave of decriminalization. Okay. So what happens after Measure 110 is
*  adopted by the voters in Oregon and this new system is in place.
*  So it rolls out in early 2021. It's finally happening. Police, instead of arresting people,
*  they start handing out these $100 citations. But the rollout's a bit rocky from the start.
*  Pretty soon it becomes clear that very few people are calling this state hotline to be
*  guided into treatment. And over the following months and then years, what people see on
*  the streets of Portland in particular, but also in other parts of Oregon, is a sense
*  of lawlessness. This corner of Southwest 4th and Washington
*  is in many ways a hub of downtown and one where the crisis on our streets is on full
*  display. There's open drug use. People shooting up
*  or cooking drugs on the streets. Since the overdose, how many times have you
*  smoked thus far? About 15 to 25 times today and it's probably
*  not even noon yet. You know, in portions of downtown Portland,
*  it wasn't uncommon to see people really in the throes of crisis, screaming in the middle
*  of the street. Back when I was homeless, it was brutal, but
*  nothing like it is today. Businesses were suffering. Many of them started
*  hiring private security. You can't get a police response. If you try, you
*  wait on hold for hours only to be told, just fill something out online and hope. And that
*  hope is dead. People in Portland were complaining like this
*  is getting worse. Overdoses in downtown Portland led to another
*  loss of life on the sidewalk. People started to see overdoses around them
*  on the streets. More people downtown Portland are carrying Narcan on themselves just in
*  case they encounter someone who's overdosed on the sidewalk.
*  It's just been just relentless.
*  And through all that, the overdose numbers are surging upward.
*  Opioid overdose deaths rose 50 percent in 2021, then another 30 percent
*  2022. It's gotten so bad that in the county where Portland is, there are more
*  deaths during the pandemic from overdoses than from COVID.
*  Wow. And even for people who had supported this decriminalization movement,
*  they're starting to rethink their position.
*  Before long, there's a rising call in Oregon to get rid of Measure 110 altogether.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Mike, as people start calling for Measure 110 to be rolled back, I'm
*  wondering, were they right to point the finger at this law?
*  Was Measure 110 really to blame for what was happening in Oregon?
*  You know, it's really hard to say.
*  The passage of 110 is happening at the same time that these other forces are sort
*  of colliding in Oregon.
*  You know, we have the pandemic, which is contributing to societal struggles,
*  exacerbating problems on the streets.
*  We have fentanyl, which has been spreading around the country.
*  It's particularly addictive.
*  It's super cheap. It's deadly.
*  And around the time that Measure 110 passed, it was really starting to surge in
*  Oregon. And we have this other reality that Measure 110 was really supposed to be
*  two parts. And while the decriminalization component had been put into place, the
*  other half of the bill, the investments in drug treatment, were still struggling to
*  get off the ground.
*  Just explain that. I mean, how much was it struggling to get off the ground?
*  You know, the state agency that was in charge of organizing the effort of
*  directing the tax revenue.
*  It's also the same agency that was at the same time in charge of the state's COVID
*  response and distributing vaccines at the time.
*  There were delays in organizing how that revenue was going to be distributed.
*  And then later on, even when that money did go out the door, the drug treatment
*  organizations that received it, they found themselves struggling to find workers to
*  actually do the job.
*  Right. Another way, perhaps, that the pandemic collides with all this.
*  Right. And so you have these, you know, the decriminalization component may have
*  happened just a few months after the bill was passed.
*  But years after the bill was passed, there's still a fledgling effort to get these
*  treatment programs, the funding and the resources and the growth they need to
*  actually have a powerful impact.
*  So there are a number of reasons you're saying why the problem of drug use and drug
*  overdoses get worse in the aftermath of Measure 110.
*  And one of them seems to be that the measure itself isn't really fully implemented
*  and that this essential half of it treatment doesn't really ever get up and running
*  the way it was supposed to.
*  So what people end up seeing on the streets there in a place like Portland is kind of
*  one side of it, the permissive side of the law in the form of these desperate, drug
*  infused street scenes, but not much of the treatment side that was designed to treat
*  it and prevent it.
*  Yeah. And the researchers are looking at this and saying they can't find a link
*  between the passage of Measure 110 and these rising overdose numbers.
*  But to a lot of voters, it doesn't really matter.
*  And one thing that's really striking is how many progressives in the state really
*  start taking the position that it's time to make major changes to this measure.
*  Like who?
*  Well, we have a new governor, a progressive, Tina Koteck.
*  Voters did not vote to say it's OK to use drugs out in public.
*  She had been supportive of the decriminalization component of Measure 110, but she
*  starts promoting the idea of really being tougher on drugs, that sort of public drug
*  use that people are seeing on the streets is not acceptable behavior.
*  We don't allow for alcohol.
*  We don't allow for marijuana.
*  Why would we allow it for other types of drugs?
*  So unintended consequence of 110 needs to get fixed.
*  You know, another notable figure shifting on this issue is that local district
*  attorney, Mike Schmidt in Portland.
*  I do think that we need to take a hard look at open use on our streets.
*  I think it's time to recognize that that doesn't make people feel safe.
*  He now starts coming out to tell lawmakers that we really do need to have some sort
*  of criminal penalty here to ban this public drug use we're seeing in the city.
*  So I think looking at open use on our street is another area where we should maybe look
*  at changing the law a little bit.
*  And as that shift is happening, we have new polling that reflects frustration.
*  It's clear to everyone that voter opinion has shifted on this.
*  Fifty six percent of Oregonians say enough is enough.
*  Get rid of it already.
*  And Democratic lawmakers leadership, you know, they're starting to see the writing
*  on the wall.
*  So by last fall, just a few months ago, there's a bipartisan group of lawmakers saying
*  that they're ready to pass legislation that would effectively roll back Measure 110.
*  And specifically, what would this legislation do and how would it do it?
*  The bill proposed to recriminalize possession of hard drugs that could result in jail
*  sentences of up to 180 days.
*  But the measure is also designed to offer a whole range of opportunities for someone
*  caught with drugs to avoid criminal penalties, to avoid a criminal record.
*  The idea was that local law enforcement could potentially choose to take someone
*  directly to treatment instead of to jail.
*  For those who do end up within the court system, the hope is to create a whole range of
*  off ramps from criminal prosecution.
*  Someone could request probation, complete treatment and then have the charges dismissed.
*  Even those who sort of go through the treatment and stumble or they don't show up or
*  they fail, they are offered additional chances along the way to get treatment instead
*  of jail time. So it's not a total rollback and recriminalization, but it's a rollback
*  and it is a form of recriminalization.
*  That's right. And this sets off really some of the most emotional and personal
*  debate you will ever see in a state legislature.
*  Thank you, everybody, for being here today.
*  This meeting is going to go until nine o'clock tonight or until we run out of public
*  testimony, whichever comes first.
*  You have supporters of the rollback saying that decriminalization was a failure.
*  I've watched firsthand the crisis unfold outside my doors.
*  Not only are most vulnerable populations dying in numbers we've never seen, but you've
*  asked the community at large to normalize walking by dead bodies on the sidewalk,
*  normalized being chased by people high on meth wielding machetes.
*  They're describing horrific scenes they witnessed on the street.
*  As a concerned father, I drive down Lancaster every morning to take my kid to school and I
*  see people in bus stops smoking fentanyl and I see kids waiting to the side because they
*  can't use the bus stops because they're telling stories of family members struggling
*  with addiction. One of my sons, Taylor Martinick, he died at the age of 24 due to a
*  fentanyl overdose.
*  They describe people who could not help themselves.
*  When Taylor was using he was in what we would call his drug brain.
*  He wouldn't have made a decision to look at a card and call a treatment center.
*  They really argue that there needs to be some sort of consequence in order to compel
*  people towards treatment.
*  I am about to celebrate five years clean in August.
*  I have been through the system myself here in Marion County.
*  I had about 15 years in and out of Marion County jail.
*  One woman actually described her own personal story of addiction.
*  And had it not been for the accountability piece when I did get clean almost five years
*  ago and the fear of going back to prison and never seeing my son again, I wouldn't be
*  sitting here today. She says the fear of going back to prison and not seeing her son
*  was the reason that she was motivated to get clean.
*  So these are members of the community, including former drug users, saying we think
*  decriminalization has been a mistake because we need the deterrent of criminal
*  charges. Yeah.
*  And at the same time, opponents are also filling these hearing rooms.
*  Many tonight have said that the status quo is not working.
*  And I agree. The status quo is not working because there aren't enough treatment that's
*  available. People said all those treatment programs that were promised, they're still
*  not in place. So while you can use whatever language you want in order to dress up what
*  you're doing, the fact is what you're choosing to do is to place addicts in jail.
*  And so even if you have a bill that says there are off ramps to get people out of jail
*  and into treatment, those don't yet exist.
*  And so people will be languishing in jail because people are still going to die.
*  They're just going to die in jail cells instead of on a street corner.
*  And people share, again, very personal stories.
*  As the eldest daughter of a woman who struggled with addiction almost my entire life and
*  overdose three years ago, I know firsthand the need for healing.
*  Jail never worked for my mom.
*  People describe stories of family members who had been addicted and gone through criminal
*  convictions and prosecutions and found that had not provided them help to get them out of
*  their struggles, but had rather prolong them.
*  As a mother, I have witnessed my son's struggle with opioid use disorder since 2008.
*  I can say assuredly that the biggest barrier to stability my son has faced has been his
*  involvement in the criminal justice system.
*  And it left them with trauma and stigma of conviction and made it harder for them to
*  find stability in housing or jobs.
*  If drugs are recriminalized, all it would take is one momentary slip for his many years
*  of hard work and progress to be lost.
*  And opponents of the rollback, they're warning that the state is effectively on the path
*  here to setting up war on drugs 2.0.
*  Fifty years of the war on drugs has not fixed our addiction crisis.
*  Fifty years of disproportionately harming Black and Brown Oregonians.
*  How will the solutions you are proposing be different?
*  I heard a lot of people in 2020 say that they believe Black Lives Matter, but you don't.
*  If you pass something like this, they're warning that the racial disparities are going
*  to come back and it's going to upend lives.
*  Thank you.
*  Members, anything to add before we conclude?
*  So what ends up being the final vote in the legislature?
*  The bill passed pretty swiftly by wide margins in both the House and the Senate.
*  And now Governor Kotec has signaled that she's ready to sign it.
*  So measure 110 is effectively dead now.
*  That's right.
*  And where, Mike, does that leave the broader movement that you described earlier as so
*  excited about the passage of 110 in Oregon, that advocate who said this was taking a
*  sledgehammer to the old regime, the old war on drugs.
*  I mean, what does this do to the hopes of decriminalizing hard drugs more broadly?
*  I mean, this whole experiment in Oregon has really been quite a devastating setback to
*  the decriminalization movement.
*  You know, a lot of other states were watching Oregon to see whether it was a pathway to
*  success, whether they could replicate the model, whether they should be the next ones
*  to be decriminalizing in their state.
*  And now all of those seem to be off the table.
*  You know, there are not lawmakers moving toward decriminalization.
*  And same with voters.
*  You know, that ballot initiative that advocates had hoped to pass in California to
*  decriminalize drugs this year.
*  Now, instead, it's the opposite.
*  Advocates are now facing the prospect of battling an initiative that would actually
*  increase drug penalties.
*  You know, in cities all up and down the West Coast, there's sort of an effort to crack
*  down once again.
*  In San Francisco, we saw the mayor pressing to arrest drug users, saying that tough love
*  is sometimes needed.
*  Voters there last week approved a measure to require drug screening for welfare
*  recipients. That's the kind of policy we often see Republicans proposing, not people
*  in a progressive city like San Francisco.
*  Right.
*  So there has been a major shift here that has served as quite the setback for people
*  looking to end criminal penalties for those possessing drugs.
*  But, Mike, because this was such a flawed rollout of Measure 110 in Oregon, it feels
*  like it's hard to know whether this was a flawed idea.
*  I mean, there's something a little bit tragic about it in that sense, because Measure 110
*  never really functions the way it was supposed to have.
*  So we don't really have a model for a successful implementation of decriminalization
*  and treatment of hard drugs upon which the public can judge whether the basic logic of
*  this is sound.
*  Right. And instead, we're getting a backlash to a poorly executed version of this that
*  has seemed to quash the entire project.
*  Yeah, when I was down at the state capitol in recent days, I was talking to some lawmakers
*  who said that given the lack of the state's treatment options back in 2020, Oregon was
*  the worst place to try a decriminalization experiment.
*  Some of those lawmakers hope that maybe one day, once the treatment programs are placed
*  and they're working, maybe they could once again explore removing those criminal penalties.
*  The argument here basically is that in an ideal world, somebody would execute a plan
*  like Measure 110 as it was fully envisioned in a place that could support it.
*  And then we could say whether once and for all this actually works or it doesn't.
*  Yeah. But it feels like it's going to be a long time before we get there again.
*  Well, Mike, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  In defiance of their party's leader, Donald Trump, House Republicans are pushing forward
*  with bipartisan legislation that would force the Chinese owners of TikTok to sell off the
*  popular platform or face having it banned in the United States.
*  Both congressional Republicans and Democrats argue that TikTok is a national security threat
*  because of its ties to the Chinese government.
*  But Trump, who was highly critical of TikTok as president, now opposes the legislation
*  following a meeting a few weeks ago with a major TikTok investor and an effort by the British
*  royal family to defuse rumors about the health of Catherine, Princess of Wales, backfired on Monday
*  when she was forced to acknowledge that she had digitally altered a photograph of herself and her
*  children that was released over the weekend.
*  Catherine, who had surgery in January, has not made any public appearances in months, setting off
*  global speculation about her well-being.
*  The release of the photograph appeared timed to address those concerns until news agencies
*  discovered it had been altered.
*  In a statement, Catherine apologized for manipulating the image.
