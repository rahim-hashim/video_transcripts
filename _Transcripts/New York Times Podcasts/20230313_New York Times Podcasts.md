# What Is E.S.G., and Why Are Republicans So Mad About It?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bazIAR3EsJ4)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. This is a daily.
*  In the coming days, President Biden will issue the first veto of his presidency in defense
*  of an investment philosophy that many Americans have never heard of.
*  Today, my colleague, David Geles, on why that philosophy has become so controversial.
*  It's Monday, March 13th.
*  David, it hasn't happened yet, but when I imagined President Biden's first legislative veto,
*  not that I stay up late at night imagining it, but to the degree I ever had, I imagined it would be
*  a rejection of a big social proposal from Republicans, maybe something related to abortion
*  or a cherished democratic program. Instead, we now expect Biden to wield his first veto pen to
*  defend an acronym that I'm going to be honest, I haven't really ever heard of before. ESG.
*  It is not what most people had on their bingo cards. The fact that Biden's first veto would
*  be about this arcane investing philosophy that has sort of out of nowhere become this political
*  lightning rod.
*  No, it wasn't on my bingo card. So just to get this out of the way, what is ESG? What is this
*  investment philosophy?
*  ESG is one of these acronyms that Wall Street comes up with to explain what it is they think
*  they're trying to do. The E stands for environmental priorities. That's things like reducing carbon
*  emissions. The S stands for social factors. That is things like good labor policies and
*  improving diversity in the workplace. And the G is for governance, that is good corporate
*  governance, making sure a corporation's house is in order and that their executive compensation
*  policies are best in class. And all of this was invented as a way to essentially make sure that
*  companies were not just doing right for investors and taking care of their bottom line, but also
*  taking care of all these sort of softer issues that people have decided companies ought to be
*  paying attention to over the last couple of decades.
*  Okay, well, that timeframe of two decades or so makes me want to understand exactly where
*  ESG comes from. What's the origin story behind this?
*  Well, the term itself has been around since 2004. But it really isn't until the years after the
*  financial crisis that it starts picking up steam. And you have to remember that the financial crisis,
*  especially here in the United States, was this traumatic event. Millions of homeowners saw
*  their savings and their assets wiped out. Big banks were bailed out by the government. None
*  of the people responsible seemed to go to jail. There is fresh evidence that Americans are
*  increasingly angry at Wall Street, at Washington and more. And there was a real sense of betrayal
*  by the American public. Who side are you on? Main Street or Wall Street and the big corporation?
*  Trust will be Wall Street's issue for a long time to come.
*  In the wake of that, Wall Street and big business in particular needed sort of a rebranding. And
*  lots of new narratives came to the fore. There used to be a myth that you couldn't do well and
*  do good at the same time. You certainly know the role that corporate American can play when they
*  put their mind to things. There was CSR. They are starting with their own CSR operations,
*  corporate social responsibility. For corporate social responsibility,
*  people started talking about DEI. The issue is not finding diverse candidates. It's making sure
*  that they have access to hiring, diversity, equity and inclusion. But at the end of the day,
*  there's a process and investment called ESG. And that's really catching on with investors right now.
*  There ESG emerges as the sort of influential umbrella term. This is the sort of work that
*  we do at our institution. Yes. ESG. ESG. ESG. There's too many letters in here. What's ESG?
*  ESG is Environmental, Social and Governance Standards. It's the Uber acronym that encompasses
*  all of these other efforts that businesses seem to be pursuing to do right not just for their
*  investors, but for society too. There are about seven different areas that we look at. The
*  environment, diversity practices. A lot of these issues are things that companies believe they can
*  measure. For example, companies can track how much pollution and waste they're putting out there.
*  They can measure their gender and diversity policies. And they can tell you how much employees
*  on balance are making and how that's affecting things like income inequality at the country at
*  large. And so it creates the framework for a real industry that is able to start measuring just how
*  good different companies are doing on their ESG journeys. I think there's hope that every company
*  can have a very strong environmental social governance profile.
*  David, as admirable as all those measurable metrics might be, there are plenty of investors
*  who just want to make money. They don't care whether the corporation they're buying stock in
*  or the fund that they're buying shares of has diversity or cares about the environment.
*  So isn't that a significant limitation on this philosophy?
*  That is certainly an argument many of ESG's critics make. But here's the Jiu Jitsu of ESG.
*  ESG proponents would tell you that not only are a lot of these things that ESG is paying attention to
*  good for the world, but they're actually good for business in the long term. This strategy's
*  proponents will tell you that it's good long term investing for companies to wean themselves off
*  fossil fuels, because the science is clear, society needs to stop burning fossil fuels.
*  So the companies that are further along in that journey, they say, are going to be better
*  investments. Similarly, on the diversity side, many people would argue that more diverse
*  corporations that are reflective of the broad and diverse population, that is the United States,
*  for example, are going to be better suited to meet the needs and consumer demands of an increasingly
*  diverse marketplace. And all of this reinforces this broader point that proponents of ESG make,
*  which is that this isn't just about doing the right thing for the world or the right thing for
*  society, that at the end of the day, all of this is good for business. Got it. Okay. So how widely
*  adopted does this ESG philosophy become? It's really hard to find a company these days that
*  doesn't lean in to ESG at some level. Apple has a plan and a promise to make every single
*  Apple product carbon neutral by 2030. Even yours, Apple, Nike, respect for human rights is embedded
*  in Walmart's core values, Walmart, Walgreens, Target. Here at Target, we've had a long standing
*  commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. All of these companies have big operations where
*  they're pursuing their ESG goals and telling the world about it. Our efforts are making a difference
*  in our stores and our communities. And it's not only the companies that are doing it themselves.
*  From this emerges a whole cottage industry of ratings agencies, companies like Bloomberg
*  and Dow Jones and Thomson Reuters, S&P Global, Moody's, who'd start issuing ESG scores. And then
*  with those scores, fund managers, that is big institutional investors that buy these big chunks
*  of companies and put them in portfolios that retirement funds that invest in, they start
*  creating ESG funds. So that the biggest investment firms in the world, BlackRock, Vanguard,
*  these titans of finance are now increasingly putting their money into an ESG strategy that
*  is taking up more and more of the assets under their management, as much as $18 trillion in the
*  last couple of years. Wow. I mean, that's a huge amount of money and very clearly suggests that
*  this is a widespread, meaningful movement within American business right now. It's become a huge
*  deal. But even as it is becoming just ubiquitous in the corporate world, it's not without its critics.
*  There are those who dispute the degree to which they see it sort of prioritizing certain social
*  and political issues they might not agree with. And there are those who just dispute this premise
*  that it's actually a good long-term investment to pursue these policies. And over the last couple
*  years, we've seen those critics get organized and go on the offensive.
*  We'll be right back.
*  David, tell us that story of ESG's opponents.
*  I think one of the most crucial moments in the backlash against ESG comes about three years ago,
*  right around the start of the pandemic, when independent oil producers, small drillers in
*  Texas find themselves going to the usual banks that they've worked with for decades now, JP
*  Morgan Chase among them and saying, hey, we'd like some money for continued operations, a little
*  more money for new exploration. And the banks say, actually, we're not going to give you the
*  money this time, because we don't necessarily believe that further oil exploration is a good
*  long-term investment. We have concerns about the ability of these companies to pay back their loans
*  over time. Now, what the oil men hear is that JP Morgan's not lending us money because they're
*  turning their back on fossil fuels full stop. And they start complaining. They start complaining
*  to the Texas State Legislature. They start complaining to the Texas Railroad Commission,
*  which is the energy regulator in the state. And they start complaining to conservative activists,
*  groups like the Texas Public Policy Foundation. All of these major influential forces in Texas
*  start hearing their concerns. And in 2020, a bill emerges in the Texas Legislature and is signed
*  by Governor Greg Abbott that essentially says the state needs to stop doing business with financial
*  firms that are quote unquote, boycotting fossil fuels. That is companies that have made it their
*  mission to reduce their exposure to oil and gas, which is of course the biggest industry in Texas.
*  The Texas State Legislature says, well, if you are going to stop doing business with us,
*  we're going to stop doing business with you. And this bill is essentially designed
*  to punish companies that are pursuing the E in ESG.
*  And what does punishing companies that are worried about the E and ESG actually look like once this
*  bill is signed into law? Well, it proved a little hard to implement it. But just this past August,
*  the Texas Comptroller indeed came out with an initial list of financial institutions that it
*  deemed were quote unquote, boycotting fossil fuels. And it set in motion a process of actually
*  pulling billions of dollars of state money, funds held by the retirement accounts of teachers and
*  firefighters and police officers out of some of the most mainstream investment vehicles
*  available on the market today. Companies like BlackRock and Credit Suisse. And is that actually
*  in the financial interest of either Texas or its retirees and pensioners? Not necessarily.
*  These big financial institutions are big because they're good at what they do. And as a result,
*  they often have lower fee structures. They tend to have pretty good returns over time.
*  And in fact, there's been a flurry of studies over the last couple of months that show that
*  in states like Texas that do stop doing business with big mainstream financial institutions,
*  they are likely to incur hundreds of millions of dollars in additional fees by working with smaller
*  players on Wall Street. Got it. So this backlash starts in Texas with these wounded oilmen not
*  getting their loans. It escalates to the Texas legislature and the Texas governor. How much
*  bigger does it become than Texas? This has become a truly national movement.
*  So very quickly, something called ESG has become one of the most destructive forces in the American
*  economy. About a half dozen states have passed very, very similar laws. Yeah, West Virginia
*  today announcing that it is severing ties with five financial institutions that the treasury
*  there deems as being discriminatory towards certain industries. The state of Louisiana is pulling
*  $800 million from BlackRock, says its quote blatantly anti-fossil fuel policies would
*  destroy Louisiana's economy. Other states including West Virginia and Louisiana. By the way, Kentucky
*  is a fossil fuel producing state. It's joining a growing number of states saying no to woke
*  capitalism. It's West Virginia, also Florida, Texas, Utah. Have pulled hundreds of millions of
*  dollars out of funds managed by companies like BlackRock. BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan,
*  Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo. This is a growing movement in pushback against ESG and woke
*  capitalism. And we've seen dozens of conservative legislatures around the country push bills like
*  this. For us, it just does not make sense. We're not going to pay for our own destruction, right?
*  Even in democratic states where they are unlikely to pass at this very moment.
*  It is truly a big and growing national trend right now.
*  Every state in this country still has massive fossil fuel businesses operating today. And the
*  conservative legislatures see it as part of their mission to defend those companies.
*  But what's going on here is actually bigger than just that. Critics have a much broader set of
*  concerns. They see ESG writ large as sort of a Trojan horse that is advancing liberal policy
*  priorities. Everything from diversity in the workplace to LGBTQ rights to economic policies
*  that don't necessarily focus on the bottom line. And that gets to this essential point
*  that the critics of ESG make. They say that the point of business, as you said earlier, Michael,
*  is to make money. And that with the rise of ESG, that fundamental imperative, the profit motive
*  is being lost. But David, as I recall, the proponents of ESG argue forcefully that this
*  is not just a do-gooderism philosophy. They say it's a money-making philosophy. So do these
*  mostly Republican skeptics and critics of ESG, do they have a point now that this has been in place
*  across so many companies for a number of years? Are they right to question whether it's actually
*  improving financial returns? There are a lot of ESG funds and there are a lot of ways to slice
*  and dice the timeframe on which you measure the profitability of any of these funds. The upshot is
*  there are studies that conclude that ESG investing is indeed a good bet in the long term. But you
*  only need to look at the markets to understand that if you had divested from all your fossil
*  fuel investments last year, when oil and gas companies were some of the major winners because
*  of the war in Ukraine, well, you missed out on a big market upswing. And that is really proof
*  positive to critics that ESG is just not good business practice at the end of the day.
*  Okay. Well, let's turn to the other significant critique here, which is that ESG's are a kind of
*  liberal Trojan horse. Help me understand what exactly Republicans fear. Do they fear that at
*  this point, ESG has become so popular that companies are being pressured into doing it,
*  even if they don't want to so that they can get the proper ratings? Is that a fear?
*  That's exactly right. And beyond that, they would say that many of the CEOs of America's largest
*  companies have really adopted what they see as a progressive political agenda that they are
*  trying to implement. They look at companies protesting President Trump's immigration policies.
*  They look at companies doing things like objecting to abortion bans in different states,
*  and they see the business world, corporate America, effectively in their minds, acting as a proxy
*  for the Democratic Party. And that's why this whole movement has gone beyond state houses
*  to Congress, where just a couple of weeks ago, Republicans of the House and then Republicans in
*  the Senate joined by a couple Democratic senators passed a bill that would prevent the people that
*  invest retirement funds on behalf of federal workers from considering ESG factors when making
*  their investment decisions. And so that's, of course, how we get to Joe Biden promising
*  to veto this bill, which we touched on at the beginning of our conversation, right?
*  Not what we had on our bingo cards. Right. And why has the president said that he's
*  going to veto this? Because it certainly sounds like Biden putting his seal of approval on
*  ESG as a philosophy. It is. And I think it's important to remember two things at the same
*  time here. I think the Biden administration in vetoing this rule is essentially backing
*  the status quo in the financial industry. This whole apparatus of corporations and ratings
*  agencies and fund managers that are invested in ESG and that are arguing that it is a good long
*  term investment. But it's impossible not to also remember that that whole apparatus is largely
*  supporting policy priorities that are in line with the Biden administration's own political agenda.
*  And I can't help thinking that a Democratic president's promise to veto a bill that would
*  rein in ESG is only going to further antagonize the critics of ESG who think it's truly just
*  doing the handiwork of the Democratic Party. I think you're right. But I also think we need
*  to return to this moment just after the financial crisis, when the reputations of big business and
*  Wall Street in particular were so tarnished and many people viewed big business at large as sort
*  of morally bankrupt. The response over the last 15 years or so has been this increased engagement
*  in political, social and sometimes highly controversial issues by the biggest CEOs
*  in the country. That has gotten to a point now where politicians, especially on the right,
*  are essentially questioning whether it's really CEOs who we want to be listening to. Why, they ask,
*  are we letting CEOs set policy when they are the elected leaders?
*  So, Dave, I want to zoom really far out here because at the heart of this whole fight and
*  really at the heart of this whole conversation we're having is a power struggle, right? Who gets
*  to tell society how to operate, what priorities to emphasize? And it strikes me that for a very long
*  time, Republican elected officials had no problem giving corporations a very significant amount of
*  power in American society. And it seems like this worry about giving corporations too much power
*  has really only arrived on Republicans radar since those companies began espousing a social agenda
*  at odds with that of the Republican Party. For the longest time, for decades really, Republicans,
*  the GOP was the party of big business. And I think they feel like they've lost this historic
*  and very powerful ally. And some of all of this legislation is reflective of this deep sort of
*  identity crisis that the Republican Party is having as they look to corporate America and see
*  that some of their most trusted allies for the past generation are suddenly not standing by their
*  side. Which is painful, I have to imagine. I think it's painful. I think it's disorienting.
*  There was a pretty amazing episode just very recently when Mitch McConnell, the Senate
*  Majority Leader, was asked about the degree to which just how engaged in politics businesses
*  have become. And he said businesses should stay out of politics. And then he was asked,
*  well, should they stop giving money to politicians? And he said, well, no, no, not necessarily.
*  Right. I mean, so that really makes me wonder if what we're witnessing here is a Republican
*  frustration with where corporate wins are now blowing. Right. I mean, if we're talking about
*  $18 trillion of money pouring into these ESG funds, it starts to get hard to see these Republican laws
*  as anything but a kind of protest by people who feel that they have ended up on the losing side
*  of this kind of corporate cultural battle. Right. And I wonder if it's reached a point
*  in the business world where it's kind of impossible to stop ESG, even if Republicans really wanted to.
*  If you ask the CEO of a big company, as I often do, if all this noise is making an impact on their
*  ESG goals, they will very quickly tell you that they are committed to going net zero carbon
*  emissions in the next couple of decades. They will tell you that they believe a diverse workforce is
*  a healthy and productive workforce and they are all for good governance. In the same breath,
*  they will tell you off the record, usually, that if they never have to say the word ESG again,
*  they would be totally fine with that. This whole debate has become a political liability
*  that they don't necessarily like dealing with every day, even as they continue to fundamentally
*  believe in a lot of these priorities as the right thing to do in the long term.
*  So whether or not we call it ESG two years from now,
*  these policy priorities are not going anywhere anytime soon.
*  Well, David, thank you very much. I appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. On Sunday night, federal regulators approved an unusual
*  intervention into the banking industry to avoid a financial crisis after the government shut down
*  two regional banks. The intervention would ensure that everyone with money at the two banks,
*  Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, would be paid back in full, even if their deposits
*  exceeded the $250,000 normally insured by the government. It was the culmination of a frenzied
*  four days in which customers of Silicon Valley Bank, fearful about its financial health,
*  withdrew tens of billions of dollars, forcing regulators to take it over on Friday. Soon,
*  those fears spread to customers of similar banks, including Signature Bank. That in turn raised
*  worries that the entire banking system might be at risk and prompted the Biden administration
*  to declare that all depositors at both banks would have access to all their money as of this morning.
*  That decision and what led to it will be the subject of tomorrow's show.
*  Today's episode was produced by Will Reed, Alex Stern, Stella Tan and Michael Simon-Johnson.
*  It was edited by Lisa Chow and Anita Badejo, contains original music by Dan Powell,
*  Rooney Misto and Marion Lozano, and was engineered by Chris Wood.
