# How Streaming Hurt Hollywood Writers
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 05, 2023](https://rr3---sn-ab5l6nrz.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?expire=1711146942&ei=XrP9ZbvJLqu4_9EPuN24qAo&ip=128.59.177.129&id=o-AJ0bfEsEfsL25MmonlJlIa2OL0zblIc6tjAdYDczihMc&itag=139&source=youtube&requiressl=yes&xpc=EgVo2aDSNQ%3D%3D&mh=b8&mm=31%2C26&mn=sn-ab5l6nrz%2Csn-p5qlsny6&ms=au%2Conr&mv=m&mvi=3&pl=16&initcwndbps=996250&vprv=1&mime=audio%2Fmp4&gir=yes&clen=10194733&dur=1671.605&lmt=1683280594641655&mt=1711124696&fvip=3&keepalive=yes&c=ANDROID_EMBEDDED_PLAYER&txp=6218224&sparams=expire%2Cei%2Cip%2Cid%2Citag%2Csource%2Crequiressl%2Cxpc%2Cvprv%2Cmime%2Cgir%2Cclen%2Cdur%2Clmt&sig=AJfQdSswRQIgelAd1b-toGsm7W27MAw7ITKADS0tDz6k_wBTj8kgSGsCIQCd6eTgtDec8YjOZ9OmPTefM_BPJF39tuuN92Y_XKil9g%3D%3D&lsparams=mh%2Cmm%2Cmn%2Cms%2Cmv%2Cmvi%2Cpl%2Cinitcwndbps&lsig=ALClDIEwRgIhAIS0k3fXCWLVDGs3HIAbqXog2dOaPK0DPqNFYpKxcJJ4AiEAt5G_VT8cd2Yi1MsrIf66o65-LjrINrbWqJgxR6CuxiI%3D)
*  Hey John, how are you?
*  Good, hi.
*  Hi, nice to meet you, AUSLA.
*  Nice to meet you.
*  Claire, nice to meet you.
*  Um, alright, I mean, let's get started.
*  No writers, no TV.
*  No writers, no TV.
*  I'm John Coblin, I covered a television industry at the times.
*  We are about 13, 14 hours since the writer's guild of America called for a strike.
*  This is the first picket line where Midtown Manhattan outside, I see a writer from Jimmy
*  Kimmel right there, outside the NBC Universal Peacock New Front, which is sort of this event
*  that they throw for advertisers.
*  And it'll be the same thing in LA later today.
*  Sorry, if folks can continue to back up, please make room.
*  I'm not tall enough to see all the way down, but it's almost going all the way up from 47 to 30.
*  They're basically taking up the entire block of this point.
*  I need you guys to go all the way to the corner unless you're on the line.
*  There's a sign that says no scripts for you, like the Jerry Signfield.
*  Lie for me, I'm just trying.
*  I think it's something like pay your workers or will spoil successions.
*  That's pretty good.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tevernicee, and this is The Daily.
*  We ride for late night with Seth Meyers.
*  I created the show Doke's Sick, and I'm the co-creator of Empire.
*  I'm with The Daily Show.
*  Also The Daily Show.
*  Tell me why it's for new three women, which started at Showtime and is about to premiere on Stars.
*  This week, thousands of writers went on strike against the Hollywood Studios.
*  You know, can you tell me why you support the strike?
*  These companies are absolutely destroying our industry.
*  They're making it impossible for young writers to make a living.
*  Over what they say is an existential threat to their livelihood.
*  I moved to New York to become a comedy writer and performer and producer.
*  And for so many years I did that, and now I wonder, is it not possible to have a middle class lifestyle doing this?
*  Today, my colleague John Koblin explains how streaming turned the most prolific era in American entertainment into a fight that's brought Hollywood to a standstill.
*  Everyone watches TV, everyone watches movies, everyone consumes it, pay us fair wages.
*  It's Friday, May 5th.
*  So John, the writers in Hollywood are on strike for strike in 15 years.
*  Tell me what's happening.
*  So earlier this week, 11,500 TV and movie writers announced they're going on strike.
*  Much of Hollywood's production is going to grind to a halt.
*  The writers are represented by the writers' guild of America, one of the most powerful unions in Hollywood.
*  And basically, they're fighting about one thing with big Hollywood studios.
*  Money, despite the fact that television production has exploded in the last decade, the WGA, the writers' guild, they've said that writers' pay has stagnated.
*  And they've been saying for weeks that this moment is existential.
*  They say the system is broken and it really has to do with how this industry has changed dramatically in the last decade.
*  And it all has to do with streaming.
*  Right, we live in a world of streaming now, right?
*  There's no more rushing home to watch Seinfeld at 8 p.m.
*  It's streaming the handmaid's tail 10 episodes at a time, so I watch them all, like, I'm eating a piece of chocolate cake on a Saturday.
*  But you think that that would mean a real golden age for writers. So what happened?
*  In today's busy world, going to the video store is a hassle.
*  With Netflix.
*  So let's go back to 10 years ago.
*  Return one and this prepaid envelope.
*  And they'll automatically send you another movie from your list.
*  Netflix, basically back then, was known primarily as a DVD company.
*  Right.
*  But they had a streaming service at that point that was four years old.
*  And Netflix executives were pretty convinced that watching TV and movies over the internet was going to become a thing.
*  So it was time for them to get into original series.
*  It all started with House of Cards, the big original show from Netflix, which premiered in 2013.
*  For those of us climbing to the top of the food chain, there can be no mercy.
*  There is but one rule. Hunt or be hunted.
*  Starring Kevin Spacey from the director David Fincher, like Hollywood royalty at the time.
*  I remember it well.
*  There are two kinds of pain.
*  Sort of pain that makes you strong or useless pain.
*  Sort of pain that's only suffering.
*  And it was weird, right?
*  That Netflix was making a TV show.
*  Like Netflix is basically the post office that sent you those little red DVD things.
*  Completely.
*  It was crazy.
*  And I'll never forget watching House of Cards for the first time where all 13 episodes at first season were available.
*  Yeah.
*  So it was 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock midnight, one in the morning.
*  Suddenly, I just burned through four episodes.
*  It was such a crazy concept.
*  Yeah.
*  So it was a huge hit and it also changed everything.
*  It proved that watching a television show over the internet could work.
*  And it caused a shift in the industry, which fundamentally changed the way that writers work.
*  And it changed the business for the studios, which has led us to this moment.
*  So let's talk about that.
*  How did streaming change the industry, not just for us as viewers, but also for the people making these shows?
*  So production has really, really changed.
*  Think back to the 1990s.
*  You hide my clothes? I'm wearing everything you want.
*  You've got friends. You've got ER.
*  Dr. Ross?
*  Yeah.
*  AB in a four.
*  You've got Seinfeld.
*  Seinfeld is now the number one condiment in America.
*  Do you know why?
*  Because people like to say Seinfeld.
*  And a season would be more than 20 episodes.
*  And if you were a writer, staffed on a show like that, a network show, you were taking care of.
*  That was your career.
*  But in the streaming world, now that we've got those movie stars, who like shorter commitments,
*  we've got seasons that are eight, nine, ten episodes.
*  Yeah.
*  What is this?
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm curious.
*  No.
*  No, I'm glaze.
*  Did you watch the White Lotus a few months ago?
*  Please, these guys, they're trying to murder me.
*  Oh, I was desperate to.
*  All my friends did.
*  I didn't actually because I was working too much on the daily, but I planned to.
*  That was seven episodes this past season.
*  The first season was six episodes.
*  So with these shorter seasons, the writers are sometimes working as little as ten weeks.
*  Wow.
*  And then they're left scrambling to find another job.
*  So they've said that this is untenable.
*  And it's affecting everyone.
*  It's affecting totally decorated show runners.
*  And writers just getting their foot in the door.
*  So it sounds like everything is just much less stable for writers, much shorter seasons,
*  just a few months or even a few weeks versus whole year or several years,
*  which means by definition less work and more scrambling.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know, it has benefited the studios to be extent that it's created a more efficient structure
*  for how they produce these shows.
*  But the writers think that there could be long-term consequences to this.
*  I recently interviewed Mike Sureer.
*  He's the co-creator of Parks and Recreation and the creator of the good place.
*  Yeah.
*  And he really is worried about the future because he gave me an example.
*  When he was a young writer on the office, he said he learned how to write a script, re-write a script.
*  He learned about editing.
*  He learned how to work with actors on set.
*  He learned how to scout a location.
*  And then he became familiar with specialized crafts like sound mixing and set design.
*  He learned how to make a TV show essentially.
*  But Mike Sureer says that with the current system,
*  writers are only writing.
*  They are gone after those 10 weeks and they're not even invited into the production process.
*  Okay.
*  So the writers are saying this is also bad for career development.
*  Like they're a cog in a machine instead of an apprentice learning how to make the machine.
*  Yeah.
*  They say it's bad for their careers, but on top of that, it's bad for the industry at large.
*  So he thinks there could be a future where writers are going to be asked to be showrunners and to create a show.
*  And they could have a lot to say about the world and they could be fantastically talented.
*  But they're not going to know how to do it.
*  And that could be a long-term problem.
*  Right.
*  And the other way, it's bad for the industry.
*  I mean, think about how it was done 20 years ago.
*  If you're watching network television, you just bought a TV, you turned it on, and it was free.
*  A cable network, you paid your cable bill automatically every month.
*  But these streaming services, they're subscription-based services.
*  So you are paying every month for your Netflix account.
*  In fact, I remember when Netflix used to advertise proudly, cancel us anytime.
*  We've got it right at the top of the website.
*  If you're not pleased, you can cancel us.
*  Easy and easy out.
*  Easy and easy out.
*  But the problem is, some people are taking them up on that, and that's true of all the streaming services.
*  So you need a ton of fresh content to keep them subscribed.
*  And maybe this is obvious for people, John, but why exactly was that?
*  Like, why did they need tons of content?
*  To keep these people hooked, to keep their subscribers hooked.
*  I mean, consider how much Netflix is shooting at you every single week.
*  Their reality shows, movies, TV shows, foreign language shows, and now they're not alone.
*  Here it comes. It's finally here. The streaming wars are hitting the high gear today.
*  In 2019, Disney Plus is the team.
*  Disney started its streaming service, Disney Plus.
*  Apple has unveiled its new streaming service, Apple TV Plus.
*  Apple TV Plus started like within a week or two of Disney Plus.
*  Apple will produce original content for the platform, and it's expected to bring new competition for existing sites like Netflix.
*  Shortly thereafter, HBO Max launched.
*  And you can watch shows like Game of Thrones and Friends or movies like Wonder Woman and The Wizard of Oz.
*  And then the peacock has hatched.
*  I know I personally cannot wait to binge watch all 17,624 episodes of the Today Show.
*  So you have all these streaming services and they're all competing with each other,
*  and it's created this sort of arms race.
*  And as a result, the number of shows just exploded.
*  I mean, last year there were something like 500 scripted shows in the United States.
*  10 years ago, that was something like 250 or 300.
*  Oh my God, that's amazing.
*  So it's just, it has blown up, and it's also created opportunity.
*  There are more diverse shows.
*  Show that just wouldn't have been made 10 years ago.
*  I'll get you, Blondie. What'd you do?
*  Orange is the new black, a show about a women's prison.
*  Hi, I'm Daphne Sparkles.
*  Transparent, which featured a transgender character.
*  It feels like I'm the only one who's putting in any effort by inviting me to brunch.
*  I'm a secure from Issa Rae, a show focused on black female friendships.
*  Can I just please get a kids meal?
*  Or Atlanta from Donald Glover or Fleabag.
*  It had it's nice.
*  Oh, lovely bag.
*  That's something that would never have gotten made 15 years ago.
*  So you're trying to program to every conceivable demographic.
*  So there was a lot more opportunity, and that's great creatively.
*  But the writers have said that the economics just haven't been working.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So John, we've talked about how streaming has changed the way TV shows are made.
*  But what about the underlying business?
*  Has it changed how the people who make these shows, including the writers, make their money?
*  So it's upended the economics, really, and how both sides make money.
*  So one of the things that the writers are fighting for in this dispute is better residual pay.
*  That's a type of royalty.
*  In the old model, with success, a writer would get a lot.
*  So the Big Bang Theory, that was a show on CBS.
*  If you're flipping through channels and you see it on TBS, it's in syndication.
*  That's like a rerun.
*  So if you wrote an episode of a popular show and it goes in a syndication,
*  you could potentially make a pretty decent amount of money off of episodes you wrote.
*  You'd like just get a check in a mail.
*  Or if the production company, which was Warner Bros. in this case, sells it overseas.
*  And suddenly you're in Ireland watching a Big Bang Theory, you just get a check in a mail.
*  And this really helped writers, if you lose your TV job, because shows get canceled all the time,
*  you can take a minute before you find your next job.
*  Maybe you want to create a show. Maybe you want to write a movie script.
*  They argue that those residual payments would keep you afloat.
*  It was sort of a critical source of income for the middle class writer.
*  Okay, crucial economic lifeline in the before days. What about now?
*  So now they argue that everything has changed.
*  Because if you are in Netflix or you're in Amazon, there are no distribution arms.
*  You're not putting shows into syndication.
*  You're not selling them overseas. They're global streaming services.
*  Now the Netflix and Amazon's pay sort of a fixed residual.
*  Writers are arguing they're making less money in sort of the afterlife of a show after it has been on the air.
*  John, from what you're describing, it really sounds like the studios are in this kind of defensive crouch over money.
*  Which is kind of weird because streaming is the way everybody watches TV now.
*  Right? Like these streaming companies have millions of subscribers.
*  And at least the people I know, they subscribe to more than one.
*  So why are they behaving like they're strapped for cash?
*  Well, the studios would actually argue that they did a lot better in the before times in sort of the cable model.
*  The cable bundle used to kick off so much money.
*  I mean, we've been talking about canceling streaming services and how easy it is.
*  You might remember how difficult it was to cancel.
*  Oh my gosh. Do I remember?
*  Yes.
*  They would try to negotiate with you.
*  They would convince you out of it.
*  You would be on the phone for 45 minutes.
*  Forget it. Just keep the cable bill going because you'll never cancel it.
*  So it was a great business as a result.
*  But the economics of streaming has made things a much crazier.
*  The technology is really expensive.
*  The marketing is really expensive because there's so much competition.
*  You want to get your billboards out there.
*  The shows are way more expensive.
*  I mean, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, a CBS drama could cost three to four million dollars in episode.
*  Now studios are investing 17, 18, 19 million dollars in episode.
*  That's close to 200 million dollars a season.
*  It's a huge amount of money.
*  So these streaming services are not making money.
*  Most companies are actually losing a lot of money of them.
*  Like more than a billion dollars a year.
*  But that was okay because the profits didn't really matter.
*  All these companies wanted to do, at least as of two years ago,
*  was just grow their subscriber base.
*  So it was okay to lose money.
*  So kind of like Uber and Lyft in the early days, right?
*  Just like compete, compete, compete for subscribers for market share.
*  And you know, if you made a loss, that was okay.
*  Because your main goal was to get market share.
*  Corner of their market.
*  Exactly.
*  And think of how cheap Uber left used to be just for the consumer as well.
*  And that was the case with these streaming services.
*  Right.
*  But then things changed.
*  It just keeps getting worse for Netflix.
*  Last April, April of 2022, Netflix lost subscribers for the first time in a decade.
*  The cost of living crisis has led to belt tightening with families across the world
*  looking at streaming services as a potential saving.
*  And then all of a sudden, everybody on Wall Street, everybody in entertainment said,
*  uh-oh, how did that happen?
*  And what they sort of realized is that...
*  Finally, maybe we're hitting sort of peak Netflix.
*  Peak Netflix investors fearing the streaming market is saturated.
*  Netflix, they had saturated the American market.
*  Everyone who's going to subscribe has largely subscribed.
*  It's just about sort of keeping that base low.
*  There really aren't that many more subscribers to find in the US.
*  And now the company is considering some major changes.
*  And this kicked off what many in Hollywood have called the Netflix correction.
*  In recent months, Netflix has had to change course and cut costs from laying off hundreds of staff
*  to cracking down on password sharing in some regions by charging additional fees.
*  That's when Wall Street changed its mind about the growth at any cost, strategy of these media companies.
*  That's when they said, we need to see these streaming services turn a profit.
*  We cannot see losing a billion dollars a year.
*  And the fallout from that over the last year has been brutal.
*  Disney is looking to find 5.5 billion in cost savings.
*  Disney is in the midst of 7,000 job cuts.
*  CNN, starting a new round of layoffs just months after
*  shuddering its CNN plus streaming service.
*  Warner Brothers Discovery cut thousands of jobs last year
*  and also shelved titles.
*  Yeah, another disappointing quarter for Paramount.
*  If we take a look at the numbers here, revenue coming in.
*  And other companies like Paramount or NBC Universal,
*  they've also adopted these cost saving measures.
*  So again, similar to Uber and Lyft,
*  at some point, investors said profits are important.
*  Make them.
*  So given that in this situation,
*  can the companies afford what the writers are asking?
*  Well, shortly before the strike was announced,
*  the studios said that they actually did offer,
*  quote, generous increases in compensation for writers,
*  as well as, quote, improvements in residuals.
*  But the studios also said that there were just too many
*  other outstanding issues on the table.
*  I talked to one of the negotiators on the writer's side.
*  And he told me the night the strike was announced
*  that philosophically and practically the two sides
*  are very far apart.
*  So John, all this brings us back to the deadlock,
*  where we still are and maybe for some time.
*  What's the immediate effect of it?
*  So daily shows, shows that are made every day,
*  like late night shows, they've gone dark.
*  So no Stephen Colbert, no Seth Meyers, no Jimmy Kimmel,
*  they are all sitting this out.
*  They're all WGA members and they are,
*  there'll be no new shows for the foreseeable future.
*  Saturday Night Live also off the air
*  and they might not be able to have their season finale.
*  Soap operas, they will run out of episodes within a few weeks,
*  maybe a month.
*  Longer term, it would take a while.
*  I mean, there are a lot of shows that are in the can
*  and there are some shows where all the scripts are done
*  and they can keep filming.
*  However, if it's a really long strike,
*  it was strike last several months.
*  Viewers could start to notice fewer new TV shows
*  by the end of the year, early next year.
*  And that might mean more unscripted series.
*  In the past, when other strikes happen, there have been several.
*  The industry has adapted in interesting ways.
*  For example, during the 1988 strike, which lasted five months,
*  that's when Fox program cops,
*  because it needed unscripted programming.
*  I mean, I didn't realize that.
*  And during the 2007-2008 strike,
*  that's when NBC decided,
*  is there something we could do to shake up the apprentice?
*  And that's when NBC executives came up with Donald Trump's
*  the celebrity apprentice.
*  Funny.
*  Funny.
*  Like necessity is the mother of invention.
*  You don't have writers.
*  Yep.
*  You do reality TV.
*  So in a way that changes have the ability to shape our culture.
*  Like in quiet ways, we don't always fully notice or understand.
*  Totally.
*  And the actors and directors, their unions,
*  those negotiations are going to begin soon.
*  And their contracts expire at the end of June.
*  So that could either complicate the writer's strike.
*  That is, those two unions make a deal and kind of undercut the writer's guild.
*  Or they decide their working conditions have been upended by streaming.
*  And then suddenly, we have three unions on strike at once.
*  So like a 10-car pile-up of strikes, basically?
*  That would really be like a disaster.
*  That would be catastrophic for Hollywood.
*  Okay, but just stepping back here for a second.
*  Like, what would you say to someone who sees this strike from the outside
*  and is trying to make sense of it?
*  Like, listening to this podcast.
*  I mean, we're talking about professional writers in Hollywood, right?
*  Like, educated people basically pretty much fine in the workforce.
*  No?
*  I mean, like in some sense, world's smallest violin.
*  No?
*  Right.
*  Well, I mean, from the writer's perspective,
*  there's a distinction between the big established names,
*  the Shonda Rhymes is, the Rhyme Murphy's, the multi-millionaires,
*  versus the working writer trying to get their foot in the door,
*  trying to craft a career.
*  And also, a prolonged strike has the potential to affect a lot of people in the industry,
*  not just writers.
*  The last time there was a strike 15 years ago,
*  it damaged the Los Angeles economy by an estimated $2.1 billion.
*  Oh, wow.
*  What was that made up of?
*  So, there are so many small businesses that help keep productions afloat.
*  That includes drivers, custom drive cleaners, caterers,
*  set carpenters, lumber yard workers.
*  The whole ecosystem of movies.
*  Exactly.
*  And a lot of them will soon be out of work, especially as Hollywood production gradually grinds to a halt.
*  And they just regain their footing out of the pandemic.
*  So, that really increases the stakes of a strike,
*  and could potentially lead to some community fissures.
*  So, John, I'm left wondering at the end of our conversation,
*  what this fight over-streaming has showed us.
*  Has it shown us that we, as consumers of all this content,
*  were the winners, but it's a much murkier new world for the studios and the creatives?
*  And is this the end of the era of amazing television?
*  Not necessarily.
*  We're not going to see the days of 500 scripted shows anymore,
*  but good TV and good movies.
*  They've been around for a long time.
*  And if you think at a time when the writers have gone on strike before,
*  many times these occurred at sort of these inflection points
*  because of big technological shifts.
*  In the 1980s, you had the rise of capable TV
*  and the rise of a home video.
*  In 2007, during that strike,
*  think of how we were consuming content back then.
*  You still bought DVDs,
*  but you were also starting to do it digitally.
*  You were renting shows, you were downloading shows off of iTunes, right?
*  Right.
*  YouTube at that point was only two years old.
*  And now here we are at yet another technological inflection point.
*  But we still have TV.
*  We still have movies, like really good ones.
*  It's been about a decade since the streamers have become ascended.
*  But we're still in the early days of the streaming wars.
*  So there are going to be inevitable skirmishes.
*  This will not be the last one.
*  But yes, VCRs are gone, cable slowly going away, but TV persists.
*  TV is not over.
*  It's just going to be different.
*  John, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should note today.
*  On Thursday, four members of the proud boys, including their former leader,
*  were convicted of seditious conspiracy for plotting to keep Donald Trump in power
*  by leading a violent mob in attacking the Capitol on January 6, 2021.
*  The fifth and lowest level defendant in the case, Dominic Pizzola,
*  was found not guilty on the sedition charges, although he was convicted of other serious felonies.
*  It was one of the most serious cases brought in the attack.
*  And the verdicts were a major blow against one of the country's most notorious far-right groups.
*  And another milestone in the Justice Department's vast investigation of the Capitol attack.
*  And North Carolina hastily approved legislation on Thursday that would ban most abortions
*  after 12 weeks of pregnancy, setting the stage for a likely test of the Republican party's new,
*  but slim, supermajority in the state.
*  The state's Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, said he would veto the measure and has 10 days to do so.
*  But the legislature now has the potential to override his veto if Republicans can keep their party united to muster enough votes.
*  North Carolina currently allows abortion up to 20 weeks and has been one of the few states in the South
*  that preserved substantial access to the procedure after Roe v. Wade was overturned last summer.
*  Today's episode was produced by Diana Wynn, Sydney Harper, Michael Simon Johnson,
