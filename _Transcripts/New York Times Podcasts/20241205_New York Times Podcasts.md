# The Supreme Court Takes On Transgender Care for Minors
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCwGq4V7LQY)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today.
*  In history-making arguments on Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard a major case on the
*  rights of transgender children that could help uphold or dismantle dozens of laws across
*  the country.
*  My colleague Adam Liptak listened in and explains how it played out and how the justices are
*  likely to rule.
*  It's Thursday, December 5th.
*  Adam, welcome back to the show.
*  It's good to be here.
*  Adam, this case that we're going to talk about today has that feeling of bigness that comes
*  when the Supreme Court takes up a defining social issue of our time at the precise moment
*  when that issue is completely front and center.
*  That's right.
*  This is the biggest case of the term and would have been regardless, but it hits the court
*  just as we're coming off a presidential campaign in which trans rights played a central role.
*  The Supreme Court confronts an important civil rights issue at just the moment in time when
*  it's at the peak of public scrutiny.
*  Right.
*  Not just the presidential campaign, but school boards across the country and sports leagues
*  across the country.
*  Tell us about this case and, Adam, how it fits into all of that.
*  This case, Michael, presents probably the most fraught question of all, gender transition
*  care for people under 18.
*  The case concerns a Tennessee law that bars providing some kinds of medical care to transgender
*  minors, to people under 18 years of age.
*  In particular, puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery.
*  23 other states have similar laws.
*  The Tennessee law was challenged by three families and a doctor.
*  The Biden administration intervened on the side of the families and they say that the
*  law violates the Constitution's equal protection clause.
*  Can you just explain that argument started by these families and, as you said, picked
*  up by the Biden administration about why this is an equal protection 14th Amendment case?
*  The equal protection clause says that some kinds of discrimination are presumptively
*  unlawful and the classic examples are, of course, race or gender.
*  And what the families and the Biden administration say here is that this law is an example of
*  sex discrimination.
*  It says that certain forms of care are available to everybody except minors who are seeking
*  gender transition care.
*  And you have to take account of the sex of the child involved to know whether they're
*  entitled to get that kind of treatment or not.
*  So think about it this way, Michael.
*  If you have a child assigned male at birth experiencing precocious puberty, meaning he's
*  going through puberty earlier than he wants to, he can get puberty blocking drugs.
*  If a transgender boy doesn't want to experience puberty because it doesn't align with his
*  gender identity, he's not entitled to the very same treatment.
*  So the challengers would say that example tells you that this Tennessee law is a form
*  of sex discrimination.
*  So under this Tennessee law, the same medicines and procedures are available or not available
*  depending on whether you are a transgender boy or girl or not.
*  And therefore the claim being made is it's discriminating against trans boys and trans
*  girls.
*  That's the claim under the 14th Amendment.
*  That's the challengers argument.
*  The state will come back and say, no, we're not drawing distinctions based on transgender
*  status.
*  We're drawing distinctions based on the medical procedure.
*  These are different medical procedures, they would say.
*  And the reason why this matters is that the Supreme Court has said that if it is sex discrimination,
*  the law is subject to a very demanding form of judicial scrutiny.
*  Lawyers call it heightened scrutiny.
*  And what it means is that a state has to prove that it has a good reason for the law and
*  that the restriction advances that reason.
*  And that's a difficult hurdle to overcome.
*  Got it.
*  And just to be very clear, because I think this might escape people's understanding,
*  the government's legal argument here is not about whether this Tennessee law, and I guess
*  laws like it, violate the rights of trans people as trans people, but instead about
*  whether this law is a form of sex discrimination, which is different.
*  Right.
*  And that's kind of a consequence of necessary litigation strategy.
*  Surely the challengers would prefer to make the more straightforward argument that this
*  is discrimination based on gender identity.
*  This is discrimination based on transgender status and not have this kind of intermediate
*  workaround about sex discrimination.
*  But sex discrimination, the court has ruled, is subject to heightened scrutiny.
*  And transgender status, they have never said is subject to heightened scrutiny, and almost
*  do for a state to discriminate against transgender people if it's not sex discrimination.
*  So while the transgender discrimination idea is in the case as a backup argument, most
*  of the chips of the challengers are put on the sex discrimination argument, because that's
*  the one where we know heightened scrutiny kicks in if the court agrees it's sex discrimination.
*  Okay, got it.
*  So Adam, take us into the courtroom for these arguments from the federal government and
*  the state of Tennessee.
*  We'll hear argument this morning in case 23477, United States versus Scrumedy.
*  General Prelogger.
*  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.
*  So the case United States against Scrumedy starts with the Solicitor General of the United
*  States, Elizabeth Prelogger, the top appellate lawyer in the Justice Department representing
*  the Biden administration.
*  SB1 bans the care outright, no matter how critical it is for an individual patient.
*  And that approach is a stark departure from the state's regulation of pediatric care in
*  all other contexts.
*  SB1 leaves the same medications and many others entirely unrestricted when used for any other
*  purpose, even when those uses present similar risks.
*  Telling the justices that whatever else you can say, a law that is this categorical, and
*  that prohibits gender transition care for all minors, whatever their parents say, whatever
*  their doctors say, whatever their personal situation is, is deeply problematic.
*  And that the court should apply heightened scrutiny because this is plainly a law that
*  draws distinctions based on sex.
*  Someone assigned female at birth can't receive medication to live as a male, but someone
*  assigned male can.
*  If you change the individual sex, it changes the result.
*  That's a facial sex classification full stop.
*  And a law like that can't stand on bare rationality.
*  And so what strikes you as the justices inevitably begin their questioning?
*  Well, one major theme that runs through the conservative justices and particularly the
*  more moderate by the standards of this court, conservative justices, I'm thinking of chief
*  justice John Roberts and justice Brett Kavanaugh sort of in the middle of the court.
*  And we might think that we can do just as good a job with respect to the evidence here
*  as Tennessee or anybody else.
*  They take the view that this is above our pay grade.
*  But my understanding is that the Constitution leaves that question to the people's representatives
*  rather than to nine people, none of whom is a doctor.
*  That we can't make decisions about medical practices, that we're just nine people, we're
*  not medical doctors.
*  And it's a little reminiscent, Michael, of the opinion in Dobbs, which said, we're going
*  to send this back to the states.
*  You can have abortion, you can not have abortion.
*  Justice Kavanaugh?
*  It seems to me that if the Constitution doesn't take sides, if there's strong, forceful, scientific
*  policy arguments on both sides in a situation like this, why isn't it best to leave it
*  to the democratic process?
*  Similarly, Justice Kavanaugh says, you know, some states may be fine with these procedures,
*  others not.
*  We take no point of view on that.
*  The Constitution takes no point of view on that.
*  And we're not even capable of making these judgments.
*  And how does the government's top lawyer, the Solicitor General, respond to that?
*  She says they're kind of leapfrogging the question before them.
*  But when you look at how this law actually operates, what it is doing is denying individual
*  plaintiffs the ability to access medications on the basis of their sex.
*  The question before them is simply, is it sex discrimination?
*  If so, does a demanding form of judicial scrutiny apply?
*  And only then, once you determine that question, which is the only question she really has
*  Do you get into this area of, do we know enough?
*  What's the right answer?
*  Is it good policy?
*  Is it good law?
*  If you are concerned, Justice Kavanaugh, about maybe restricting the ability of states to
*  take a close look at these issues, I think the court could write a very narrow opinion
*  in this case that when you prohibit conduct that's inconsistent with sex, that is a sex
*  baseline.
*  So you do have to apply.
*  She's focused on what is a fairly modest ask, which is to say, what's the right way to analyze
*  the question?
*  Do you analyze it as sex discrimination giving rise to heightened scrutiny?
*  And then you get into all the other stuff the justices are eager to talk about.
*  Right.
*  But as narrow as she wants to keep this set of oral arguments, and I was watching them
*  alongside you, Adam, the justices keep finding ways to go bigger and bigger in their questions.
*  It's a wide ranging argument and all kinds of things pop up.
*  One ask in particular about one thing, if you prevail here on the standard of review,
*  what would that mean for women's and girls' sports in particular?
*  Justice Kavanaugh, who coaches a girls' basketball team, was very interested in the impact of
*  a potential ruling on transgender participation in sports.
*  Would transgender athletes have a constitutional right, as you see it, to play in women's and
*  girls' sports, basketball, swimming, volleyball, track, et cetera, notwithstanding...
*  And it wasn't just the conservative justices who seemed to want to expand the scope of
*  their questioning beyond that narrow legal question.
*  Some children suffer incredibly with gender dysphoria, don't they?
*  Yes, it's a very serious medical condition.
*  Some attempt suicide?
*  Yes, the rates of suicide are striking and it's a vulnerable...
*  Justice Sotomayor said that transgender minors suffering from gender dysphoria, the disconnect
*  between sex assigned at birth and gender identity, can go through very rough times, including
*  potential suicide.
*  One of the petitioners in this case described throwing up every day, going almost mute because
*  of their inability to speak in a voice that they could live with.
*  These are physically challenging situations as well, too.
*  So that this is an urgent situation, she says, that needs to be addressed and indicated that
*  the Tennessee law gets in the way of what can be life-saving care.
*  On the other side of the balance...
*  The restriction that I mentioned was imposed by the British government some months ago.
*  It was reaffirmed by the current labor...
*  Justice Alito kind of surveyed the world and said that much of Europe has grown cautious
*  about some forms of transgender care, to which the Solicitor General responded...
*  If the court wants to go ahead and look at what's happening in Europe, the UK has not
*  categorically banned this care.
*  Sweden, Finland, and Norway, the other jurisdictions that my friends point to, have not banned
*  this care.
*  And I think that's because of the recognition that this care can provide critical, sometimes
*  life-saving benefits for individuals with severe gender dysphoria.
*  That it's true that there have been adjustments in the UK, in Sweden, but none of them have
*  a categorical rule like the one in Tennessee forbidding transgender care as such.
*  So at this point, the argument and the justices are sort of all over the map, quite literally.
*  Sex, kids, and sports, laws in Europe, you know, all very important stuff, but really
*  beyond the very specific question of does this law discriminate on the basis of sex?
*  I guess I think there might be some confusion a little bit.
*  At least I'm confused because there's so many lines that this statute could draw.
*  And then there was a striking moment when Justice Katanji Brown Jackson says, wait a
*  second, we have a job here.
*  It's not to decide the risks or benefits of the policies that justify the law.
*  It's our job under the Constitution to decide, at least in the first instance, whether the
*  law triggers the Equal Protection Clause.
*  And the question for equal protection purposes is, if you're right that there is a sex-based
*  line being drawn, then to the extent the plaintiffs are implicated by that line, don't we have
*  to apply heightened scrutiny in evaluating their claims?
*  Yes, that's exactly right.
*  She said that's the job of the Supreme Court to police the 14th Amendment and at least
*  reach the initial question of is this sex discrimination?
*  And does that mean that a heightened form of judicial review kicks in?
*  Right.
*  She's sort of like, people, focus, we have a job here.
*  It was a striking moment.
*  Mr. Strangio?
*  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.
*  But I think in a lot of ways, one of the most memorable moments in the arguments came when
*  another lawyer challenging the law stood up to argue.
*  But SB 1 has taken away the only treatment that relieved years of suffering for each
*  of the adolescent plaintiffs.
*  Chase Strangio, a lawyer with the ACLU representing the families and the doctor challenging the
*  law, is the first transgender lawyer ever to argue before the Supreme Court, or at
*  least the first openly transgender lawyer.
*  Let me ask a question about another issue that came up during Justice Kagan's questioning.
*  And he pretty quickly gets into an exchange with Justice Alito, who's one of the Court's
*  most conservative members, that's really quite remarkable.
*  Is transgender status immutable?
*  Alito asks him whether transgender identity is immutable.
*  I think that the record shows that the discordance between a person's birth sex and gender identity
*  has a strong biological basis and would satisfy an immutability test.
*  And Alito is essentially asking a transgender person, a lawyer arguing before the Court,
*  is your identity an essential element of who you are?
*  And it's not just a striking moment.
*  It also has some legal significance.
*  Whether or not a characteristic is immutable plays into deciding whether that characteristic
*  can make you into a protected class.
*  So this was not only personal, but also an important point for his side to try to win.
*  If Tennessee can have an end run around heightened scrutiny by asserting at the outset that biology
*  justifies the sex-based differential in the law, that would undermine decades of this
*  Court's precedent.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you, counsel.
*  So Adam, when the two lawyers arguing against this Tennessee law are done and about to hand
*  it over to the folks defending this law, what are you thinking?
*  So Michael, by the time the challengers finished, and it was kind of an unwieldy romp through
*  a lot of different areas, not tightly focused on the legal question before the justices,
*  I kind of had the sense that the challengers were facing an uphill fight in what they had
*  to prove.
*  In persuading the more conservative majority that this law amounts to sex discrimination.
*  And that was before we even heard from Tennessee's lawyer, who was defending the law, and saying
*  that it wasn't about sex discrimination, but about something else entirely.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Adam, tell us about the second half of these arguments when the lawyer for Tennessee
*  argues his side of this case.
*  Mr. Rice?
*  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.
*  Tennessee's Solicitor General, Matthew Rice, says the other side misunderstands what's
*  going on here.
*  The law imposes an across-the-board rule that allows the use of drugs and surgeries for
*  some medical purposes, but not for others.
*  Its application turns entirely on medical purpose, not a patient's sex.
*  That is not sex discrimination.
*  That this isn't sex discrimination.
*  Neither boys nor girls can get this kind of medical treatment.
*  He says it's a restriction on medical procedures.
*  It's a restriction on the purpose of the procedure, not on any particular gender, not on any particular
*  sex of a patient.
*  The Equal Protection Clause does not require the states to blind themselves to medical
*  reality or to treat unlike things the same.
*  He's saying this law, if it discriminates against anyone, does so based on the purpose
*  of this medical treatment.
*  If the purpose is to transition a minor, we're not for it.
*  If it's for something else, we are.
*  He's saying as a result, it cannot be construed as discriminatory based on sex.
*  Right.
*  He would also say, listen, we are discriminating based on age, but we're allowed to do that.
*  We are discriminating based on, as you say, Michael, what the medical procedures are,
*  but we're not discriminating, he claims, based on the gender of the patient.
*  And what do the justices say to that?
*  Both the SG and petitioner have suggested...
*  Justice Clarence Thomas asks the first question to Rice, saying that maybe Tennessee could
*  have taken a different approach to its law.
*  So it becomes a pure exercise of weighing benefits versus risk.
*  And the question of how many minors...
*  And Rice starts to answer the question, says, you know, there are risks to this kind of
*  intervention.
*  I'm sorry, counselor.
*  Every medical treatment has a risk, even taking aspirin.
*  And as he's answering, Justice Sotomayor interrupts him and says, wait a second, all kinds of
*  medical procedures have risks.
*  There is always going to be a percentage of the population under any medical treatment
*  that's going to suffer a harm.
*  So the question in my mind is not, do policymakers decide whether one person's life is more valuable?
*  But the question is, what are you trying to achieve?
*  And what's the countervailing value of the harm that comes to transgender youths who
*  are deeply distressed by the disconnect between their gender assigned at birth and their current
*  gender identity?
*  But the other is...
*  Can you stop one sex from the other, one person of one sex from another sex, from receiving
*  that benefit?
*  That the same medical treatment under this law is unavailable to transgender kids, but
*  available to other kids.
*  That's the sex-based difference.
*  It's not the medical condition is the same.
*  But you're saying one sex is getting it and the other is not.
*  And the other liberal justices sort of pile on.
*  They're loaded for bear.
*  Now, looking at this statute, a girl comes in biologically and asks for a hormone to
*  deepen her voice in order to affirm the identity that she chooses, which is masculinity.
*  Justice Jackson presses the lawyer on the distinction between two different minors seeking
*  the same treatment, testosterone to lower their voices.
*  She wants to...
*  I'm sorry, one more time, Your Honor.
*  She wants to get the medication in order to deepen her voice and affirm her masculinity.
*  Your Honor, I think if it's for the purpose of identifying inconsistent with their sex,
*  she would be barred from doing that under the law.
*  Isn't that the point, Mr. Rice, that if it's...
*  And Justice Kagan jumps in as well.
*  I mean, the prohibited purpose here is treating gender dysphoria, which is to say that the
*  prohibited purpose is something about whether or not one is identifying with one's own sex
*  or another sex.
*  The whole thing is imbued with sex.
*  I mean, it's based on sex.
*  If the first half of the argument was a little diffuse and roaming across the legal landscape,
*  the second part of the argument had the three liberal members of the court really bearing
*  down on the Tennessee lawyer and really questioning him about whether this distinction he is drawing
*  between medical purpose and sex discrimination makes sense and can be sustained.
*  And in that moment, Adam, and I don't know if you felt the same way, it did feel like
*  these three liberal justices were cutting this lawyer down to size.
*  I mean, they were landing their points in this sustained prosecutorial style.
*  Right.
*  And it looked like, at least for a time, that they had Tennessee's lawyer on the ropes.
*  And that's not the argument that we're making.
*  But Rice gradually collects himself.
*  We're arguing there is no sex baseline.
*  And starts to make probably the best formulation of his argument, saying that maybe there's
*  an incidental effect on sex.
*  But sex is not the baseline.
*  Sex is not the criterion.
*  The criterion is what's the purpose of the procedure you're trying to obtain?
*  If you're a boy and you go in to get puberty blockers, you can get the puberty blockers
*  if you're going to use them for precocious puberty.
*  You cannot get the puberty blockers if you're going to use them to transition.
*  That is not a sex baseline.
*  That is a purpose baseline.
*  And both boys and girls, he says, are prohibited from getting care that is for the purpose
*  of gender transition.
*  So he says there's no sex discrimination there.
*  So our fundamental point here is not that you can discriminate against both sexes in
*  equal degree.
*  Our fundamental point is there is no sex baseline here.
*  And the only way they get to a sex baseline is by equating fundamentally different treatments
*  that defy medical reality and defy how the statute itself sets out what is a treatment.
*  And that's similar to the reasoning in Dobbs, the case that overturned Roe v. Wade.
*  There was a passage in that majority opinion that says there's an argument that abortion
*  restrictions violate equal protection because they fall disproportionately on women.
*  But that's not how equal protection works.
*  If the category, the prohibited procedure, is neutral just because one sex is more affected
*  than the other, that's not an equal protection problem, the court said in Dobbs.
*  And Rice, the Tennessee lawyer, is making a similar point here.
*  So even though abortion is predominantly a question for women, the Dobbs opinion makes
*  the case that it cannot be construed as being fundamentally discriminatory to women.
*  And now the lawyer for the Tennessee law is saying the same principle applies here.
*  Right.
*  That the prohibition is actually neutral.
*  It may happen to disproportionately affect one gender or the other.
*  But the point is what is the prohibition supposed to achieve?
*  And helpfully for the Tennessee lawyer, he is speaking to a court whose majority just
*  wrote and issued the Dobbs opinion.
*  So presumably he thinks he's going to get a pretty sympathetic ear on that point.
*  Yeah.
*  And his, the Tennessee brief in the case cites Dobbs a dozen times.
*  It knows a good thing when it sees it.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you, counsel.
*  The case is submitted.
*  The honorable court is now adjourned until Monday next at 10 o'clock.
*  So Adam, once both sides are done here, what are you thinking about how these justices
*  based on their questions, based on their tone, are likely to rule in this biggest case of
*  the term?
*  So I guess I probably put the justices in three buckets.
*  The three liberal justices are almost certainly going to want to strike down the Tennessee
*  law.
*  The most conservative justices will doubtless want to sustain it.
*  And then the group in the middle, the chief justice, Justice Kavanaugh, maybe Justice
*  Barrett might take this kind of hands off attitude saying, we don't know.
*  We're not doctors.
*  We're going to let the states do what they like.
*  And I'd be surprised if we didn't have a classic six three split where the six conservative
*  Republican appointees say the Tennessee law is fine.
*  And the three liberal Democratic appointees say that it at a minimum amounts to sex discrimination
*  and at a minimum requires new analysis by the lower courts to see whether the law can
*  clear that very high bar of heightened scrutiny.
*  And what would such a ruling mean for the 20 some state level bans that seem very much
*  related to this law in Tennessee?
*  It would seem to suggest that all of them are constitutional, at least as against an
*  equal protection challenge.
*  There is a separate possible constitutional argument not before the Supreme Court on Wednesday
*  that parents have a constitutional right to direct the medical care of their children.
*  Those challenges might still work.
*  But the equal protection challenge, which was the only challenge the Biden administration
*  pressed, would seem to be dead if we get that kind of ruling.
*  And the parental rights argument was hinted at in this case.
*  Parental rights is and has been for years a tenant of American conservatism.
*  And the case being made here would be that bans like this take a crucial decision away
*  from parents when it comes to their children.
*  Yeah, like imagine the situation of vaccines.
*  Many conservatives say if a parent doesn't want to have their child vaccinated, the government
*  can't force them.
*  That parental rights have enormous force for many American conservatives.
*  So that argument might be a more promising one before this conservative Supreme Court.
*  Of course, we do not expect the incoming Trump administration to bring such a parental rights
*  case before the Supreme Court, right?
*  No, the Trump administration is not going to do anything to enhance transgender rights.
*  So even though that argument would be available to them, they're not going to press it.
*  But that's not to say that private parties, parents, doctors, will make that argument.
*  But the Trump administration also has an important decision to make on taking office of whether
*  they disavow the position of the Biden administration in this very case.
*  And they are likely to do so.
*  And that will require the Supreme Court to do some procedural gymnastics, because the
*  only petition they agreed to hear was the one from the Biden administration.
*  And it's possible they'd find some way to substitute in the families in this case, who
*  while they argued are not strictly speaking petitioners in the case.
*  So there will be some machinations in the coming months, because there is no doubt that
*  the Trump administration is not on board for the arguments that the Solicitor General was
*  making on Wednesday.
*  Adam, putting that aside and assuming that this case does get decided in due course,
*  and assuming, as you suggested, that the justices, majority of them, side with the Tennessee
*  law, then it looks like we're in a scenario where youth trans medicine is on a similar
*  path to abortion in this country.
*  It becomes the province of state lawmakers.
*  And as a result, we get this patchwork.
*  We get two systems in the country.
*  And that means there are going to be states where this gender affirming care for young
*  people is allowed and where it's not allowed, just as we have states where abortion is now
*  allowed and it's not allowed.
*  Yeah, it's very much the same dynamic as abortion, where we might have wholly different sets
*  of laws in deep red states like Mississippi and deep blue states like California.
*  But then there may be ways in which abortion and trans care are different, because it's
*  no small thing.
*  But women can leave a state to get an abortion, come back and go on with their lives.
*  This kind of treatment might require entire families to leave the state forever, an even
*  bigger burden.
*  And then there's also the question of political power.
*  In a number of referenda around the nation, voters have reestablished abortion rights.
*  There's not this sense, I don't think, that the trans community has the political power
*  or their allies have the political power to vote in by referenda similar protections
*  for care for transgender minors.
*  Right.
*  And in that sense, these laws, especially if upheld by the Supreme Court, may end up
*  feeling like the final word on this for a long time.
*  That's right.
*  Well, Adam, as always, thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Wednesday, Pete Hegseth and his allies tried to salvage his potential nomination
*  for Secretary of Defense amid growing allegations about his public drunkenness, his sexual
*  pursuit of subordinates, and his financial mismanagement of two nonprofit groups.
*  In an interview with Megyn Kelly of SiriusXM Radio, Hegseth dismissed the allegations against
*  him as a fiction created by enemies of Donald Trump.
*  It is the classic art of the smear.
*  Take whatever tiny kernels of truth, and there are tiny, tiny ones in there, and blow them
*  up into a masquerade of a narrative about somebody that I am definitely not.
*  For his part, Trump insisted that his support for Hegseth remains unwavering.
*  But the Times reports that the president-elect is already considering alternatives to run
