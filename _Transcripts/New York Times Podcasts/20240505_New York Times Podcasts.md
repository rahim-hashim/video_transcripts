# Sunday Special: 'Modern Love'
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZSaVXE3ej4)
*  Hi, everybody. It's Sabrina. Today, instead of a Sunday read, we're doing something
*  different. This weekend, we've got an episode from our colleagues over at the Modern Love
*  podcast. If you don't know the show, it's hosted by Anna Martin. And like the New York
*  Times column that the show is named for, the podcast explores the complicated love lives
*  of real people. Today, we're sharing an episode from Modern Love's current season. It features
*  therapist and relationship expert Esther Perel talking about infidelity. Okay, here's
*  the show. And if you want more, search Modern Love wherever you listen to podcasts and subscribe.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Anna Martin. This is Modern Love. Today, I'm talking to
*  the most famous couples therapist in the world, Esther Perel. Esther's books, Mating in Captivity
*  and State of Affairs, have forced so many of us, myself included, to rethink our assumptions
*  about love. Like maybe it's unrealistic to expect the passion and fire we feel at the
*  beginning of a relationship to last forever. And when one partner cheats on the other,
*  what if it could actually bring the couple closer instead of tearing them apart? On her
*  podcast, Where Should We Begin, Esther lets us eavesdrop on sessions with real couples.
*  People come to her with impossible problems, and she somehow guides them to a breakthrough.
*  She gives them hope. When I listen to Esther's podcast, I feel like I'm getting a free therapy
*  session. So I wasn't surprised in the slightest when she told me that people come up to her
*  in public all the time and ask her deeply personal questions.
*  The grocery store is one place, but airplanes is even better.
*  Oh no, Esther. If I were you, I'd be really scared to fly.
*  They're suspended in the air and they tell you lots of things. And it is often about,
*  can trust be repaired when it's been broken? Can you bring a spark back when it's gone?
*  Can you rekindle desire when it's been dormant for so long? What do you do when you're angry
*  at yourself for having stayed when you think you should have left? Or what do you do when
*  you're angry at yourself when you've left and now you think you should have stayed?
*  You're like, I'm just at the grocery store, man. Like I need to check out.
*  Yes.
*  Clearly, people are struggling so much to be happy in long-term relationships that they're
*  cornering this woman basically everywhere she goes. And these things people ask Esther
*  about, they're exactly the kinds of high stakes, make or break questions that come up in the
*  essay she chose for our show today. It's called What Sleeping with Married Men Taught Me About
*  Infidelity by Karen Jones. Karen's essay was one of the most controversial pieces ever
*  published in the History of the Modern Love column. But when it comes to talking about
*  sex and relationships, nothing is too taboo for Esther.
*  Esther Perel, welcome to Modern Love.
*  It's a pleasure to be here.
*  So you're going to read Karen Jones's Modern Love essay. We're going to talk all about
*  infidelity. But before we get into that, I learned something about you that I need to
*  know more about. You are fluent in nine languages and you conduct therapy in seven of them.
*  Is that true?
*  Yes. So I grew up in Belgium, in the Flemish part of Belgium, and I was educated in Flemish
*  for 12 years. But we also spoke French and German and Polish and Yiddish at home. So
*  we had five languages in the house. And then I studied Spanish, Portuguese, Hebrew, and
*  English. That comes to nine.
*  Would you ever do one more just to bring it to a solid 10?
*  I always wanted to study Arabic.
*  Okay, in your free time, in your ample free time.
*  One day.
*  Are there certain languages that have better vocabulary for talking about the nuances of
*  love and relationships than others?
*  That is a very difficult question to answer because my love language, the language in
*  which I learned poetry, songs, novels, etc., was primarily French. And so of course I would
*  say French. But that may be because I was inducted in it rather than the language itself.
*  What I can say is that certain cultures are more fluent in the language of feelings, love,
*  relationships, and desire and sexuality than maybe English or Anglo cultures that are more
*  pragmatic, more practical. I think in therapy sometimes I find that there is a certain culture
*  that allows me to speak differently about death, differently about the relationship
*  of the individual to the collective. What I will say is this, in a therapy session,
*  if a person tells me something and it needs to be said in his own language, I will ask
*  them to translate it and to say it in their mother tongue. Because you hear instantly
*  the difference, the tone, the timbre, the tremble. And I know it. It's like I don't
*  even have to understand what they're saying. I know that there is an authenticity and a
*  truth to it that is very different. Sometimes afterwards I said, what did you say? But sometimes
*  I don't even need to. I know when they say, I feel alone, I ache for you, I miss you,
*  where have you gone? I can't forget you. You don't really need to understand the words
*  to understand the affect.
*  Esther, the modern love essay you're going to read for us today tackles a topic that
*  I bet is very hard to talk about in almost any language. It's called What Sleeping with
*  Married Men Taught Me About Infidelity by Karen Jones. The author Karen is recently
*  divorced and she becomes the other woman to several men. When I read that title, I kind
*  of expect this story is going to be about like all the sex she's having or the secrets
*  or how they're hiding it. But you've worked with so many couples who are in the throes
*  of dealing with cheating. So what does the word infidelity signal to you?
*  I wrote a book about infidelity. So I will say that one of my attempts in writing this
*  book was to translate in writing the complexity of this experience that can be so shattering,
*  that can fracture a family and an entire legacy. It needs more than just good, bad,
*  victim, perpetrator, villain, saint, that there's too much happening and for too many
*  people that are involved to try to reduce it. Infidelity is often about a lot of things
*  but sex. It's about betrayal, it's about violation of trust, it's about lying, it's
*  about duplicity, it's about deception. And sex is a piece of this but that is not necessarily
*  the only thing.
*  Oof, Esther, I am so excited to hear you read this. Whenever you're ready.
*  What Sleeping with Married Men Taught Me About Infidelity by Karen Jones. I'm not sure it's
*  possible to justify my liaison with married men. But what I learned from having them warrants
*  discussion. Not between the wives and me, though I would be interested to hear their
*  side. No, this discussion should happen between wives and husbands annually, the way we inspect
*  the tire tread on the family car to avoid accidents. A few years ago, while living in
*  London, I dated married men for companionship while I processed the grief of being newly
*  divorced. When I created a profile on Tinder and on OkCupid saying I was looking for no
*  strings attached and counters, plenty of single men messaged me and I got together with several
*  of them. But many married men messaged me too. After being married for 23 years, I wanted
*  sex but not a relationship. This is dicey because you can't always control emotional
*  attachments when body chemicals mix. But with the married men, I guessed that the fact that
*  they had wives, children and mortgages would keep them from going overboard with their
*  affections. And I was right. They didn't get overly attached and neither did I. We were
*  safe bets for each other. I was careful about the men I met. I wanted to make sure they
*  had no interest in leaving their wives or otherwise threatening all they had built together.
*  In a couple of cases, the men I met were married to women who had become disabled and could
*  no longer be sexual, but the husbands remained devoted to them. All told, I communicated
*  with maybe a dozen men during that time in my life. I had sex with fewer than half.
*  Others I texted or talked with, which sometimes felt nearly as intimate. Before I met each
*  man, I would ask, why are you doing this? I wanted assurance that all he desired was
*  sex. What surprised me was that these husbands weren't looking to have more sex. They
*  were looking to have any sex. I met one man whose wife had implicitly consented to her
*  husband having a lover because she was no longer interested in sex at all. They both,
*  to some degree, got what they needed without having to give up what they wanted. But the
*  other husbands I met would have preferred to be having sex with their wives, and for
*  whatever reason, that wasn't happening. I know what it feels like to go off sex, and
*  I know what it's like to want more than my partner. It's also a tall order to have sex
*  with the same person for more years than our ancestors ever hoped to live. Then, at menopause,
*  a woman's hormones suddenly drop and her desire can wane. At 49, I was just about there myself
*  and terrified of losing my desire for sex. Men don't have this drastic change, so we have an
*  imbalance, an elephant-sized problem, so burdensome and shameful we can scarcely muster the strength
*  to talk about it. If you read the work of Esther Perel, the author of the book State of Affairs,
*  you'll learn that for many wives, sex outside of marriage is their way of breaking free from being
*  the responsible spouses and mothers they have to be at home. Married sex for them often feels
*  obligatory. An affair is adventure. Meanwhile, the husbands I spent time with would have been
*  fine with obligatory sex. For them, adventure was not the main reason for their adultery.
*  The first time I saw my favorite married man pick up his pint of beer, the sleeve of his
*  well-tailored suit pulled back from his wrist to reveal a geometric kaleidoscope of tattoos.
*  He was clean-shaven and well-mannered with a little rebel yell underneath. The night I saw
*  the full canvas of his tattoo masterpiece, we drank Prosecco, listened to 80s music,
*  and yes, had sex. We also talked. I asked him, what if you said to your wife, look,
*  I love you and the kids, but I need sex in my life. Can I just have the occasional fling
*  or a casual affair? He sighed, if I asked her that kind of question, it would kill her, he said.
*  So you don't want to hurt her, but you lie to her instead? Personally, I'd rather know, I said.
*  It's not necessarily a lie if you don't confess the truth. It's kinder to stay silent, he said.
*  I'm just saying I couldn't do that. I don't want to be afraid of talking honestly about my
*  sex life with the man I'm married to. And that includes being able to at least raise the subject
*  of sex outside of marriage, I said. Good luck with that, he said.
*  I never convinced any husband that he could be honest about what he was doing,
*  but they were mostly good-natured about it, like a patient father responding to a child
*  who keeps asking, why? Why? Why? Maybe I was being too pragmatic about the issues that are
*  loaded with guilt, resentment, and fear. After all, it's far easier to talk theoretically about
*  marriage than to navigate it. But my attitude is that if my spouse were to need something I
*  couldn't give him, I wouldn't keep him from getting it elsewhere, as long as he did so in a
*  way that didn't endanger our family. I suppose I would hope his needs would involve fishing trips
*  or beers with friends, but sex is basic. Physical intimacy with other human beings is essential to
*  our health and well-being. So how do we deny such a need to the one that we care about most? If our
*  primary relationship nourishes and stabilizes us but lacks intimacy, we shouldn't have to destroy
*  our marriage to get that intimacy somewhere else, should we? I didn't have a full-on affair with
*  the tattooed husband. We slept together maybe four times over a few years. More often, we talked on
*  the phone. After our second night together, though, I could tell this was about more than sex for him.
*  He was desperate for affection. He said he wanted to be close to his wife but couldn't because they
*  were unable to get past their fundamental disconnect, lack of sex. That led to a lack of
*  closeness, which made sex even less likely and then turned into resentment and blame.
*  I'm not saying the answer is non-monogamy. That can be rife with risks and unintended entanglements.
*  I believe the answer is honesty and dialogue, no matter how frightening. Lack of sex in marriage
*  is common and it shouldn't lead to shame and silence. By the same token, an affair doesn't
*  have to lead to the end of a marriage. What if an affair, or ideally simply the urge to have one,
*  can be the beginning of a necessary conversation about sex and intimacy? What these husbands
*  couldn't do was have the difficult discussion with their wives that would force them to tackle
*  the issues at the root of their cheating. They tried to convince me that they were being kind
*  by keeping their affairs secret. They seem to have convinced themselves. But deception and lying
*  are ultimately corrosive, not kind. In the end, I had to wonder if what these men couldn't face
*  was something else altogether. Hearing why their wives no longer wanted to have sex with them,
*  it's much easier after all to set up an account on Tinder.
*  Thanks so much for that reading, Esther. It's so funny because Karen Jones directly quotes
*  you in her piece. And I feel like that is the first time ever we've had someone read an essay
*  where they're directly quoted. Nice. Did anything jump out at you as you were reading? What jumps
*  out is she tackles a lot of different things. The subject of what is sexual aliveness, what is it
*  that people actually lose when they stop being sexual with their partner, and how that loss of
*  intimacy makes the sex even more complicated. She talked about the loss, the longing that this man
*  has. I've often said that at the heart of affairs, you find duplicity and cheating and betrayal,
*  but you also find longing and loss for the life that one had, for the parts of oneself that have
*  been denied. When we come back, I talk to Esther about the harsh criticism this essay got,
*  and why Esther thinks Karen Jones deserves more credit. Stay with us.
*  So Esther, this essay by Karen Jones was kind of a lightning rod when it was published. A ton of
*  people were very critical of the author, saying she was sleeping with these men, but then also
*  having conversations with them where she was like, it's very wrong of you not to tell your wife what
*  you're up to. Why do you think this essay got so much backlash?
*  I think that the reaction to stories of infidelity are often intense. It's a subject for which people
*  are very quickly dogmatic because they have experienced the effects of it. You know, when
*  I am in an audience, like if I was to ask, have you been affected by the experience of infidelity
*  in your life? Either because one of your parents was unfaithful, or because you yourself are the
*  child of an illicit affair, or because you are the friend on whose shoulder somebody's weeping,
*  or you are the confidant of someone who is in the complete bliss of an affair, or because you are
*  the third person in the triangle. And about 80% of the people will raise their hand.
*  Wow. I mean, 80% sounds like a surprisingly large number, but when you explain it like that with
*  different tendrils of an affair that affect everyone around the affair, not just the people
*  in it, it makes total sense. And it raises intense feelings in people. Karen Jones,
*  she may have gotten the range of it, but you will hear more loudly the ones who say,
*  you are a home wrecker, which by the way, does not exist in the masculine. The home wrecker is
*  always a woman because the woman is the one who says yes. And therefore if the woman hadn't said
*  yes, then he wouldn't be able to do it. And then he would not be wrecking his family. Yeah, there's
*  no other man either, by the way. So is the other woman. There's no other man. No, not in any of the
*  nine languages you speak. No, because there's never been another man who necessarily was willing to
*  live in the shadow of a woman for his entire life. That is so fascinating. Her lover, her lover,
*  but the other woman usually means that she lives in the shadow. She doesn't just have a secret,
*  she is the secret. That is the hardest thing about it. When people are writing to her,
*  you can ask yourself, are they looking from the perspective of what it meant for her,
*  or are they looking from the perspective of what it did to me or to us? Yeah. I mean, a lot of the
*  criticism directed at Karen Jones, it seems, is coming from that perspective of saying,
*  look what she did. Look at the harm she caused. Look at the pain she caused. Which it is. Which
*  it is. Right. Not discounting that, but it is interesting because her piece is so much about
*  meaning making, right? That's the whole conceit of her essay is mining these experiences for
*  meaning and yet people came with criticism. You know, I wonder if this is like a kind of unfair
*  question, but I wonder if there is like an ethical way to be the other person. Is there a responsible
*  way to do it without participating in hurt? That depends. If you think the whole thing is unethical
*  and is an egregious betrayal of trust and violation, then you will say no. I think the
*  responsibility lies on the person who goes out, not on the lover. Here's what many people often
*  say. It's like, if you had asked me, if you had told me, but you made a decision without me,
*  you made a decision about our marriage that did not involve me at all. Right. And fair point. Of
*  course, they know for a fact too that if they had been asked, they would have said no. But there is
*  this, you know, there is the things that you say after and there is the things that you say before.
*  So ultimately, I feel like I hear you agreeing with Karen Jones here that there are really
*  important conversations that need to be happening between these husbands and their wives that
*  actually don't even have that much to do with Karen. Can you tell me more about that?
*  The conversation that Karen Jones would like these men to have with their wives is the
*  conversations that take place in my book, Mating in Captivity, because mating in captivity explore
*  the dilemmas of desire inside relationships. And why do people seize wanting and could they want
*  what they already have? And why does good sex fade even in couples who still love each other as much
*  as ever? And why do kids often deliver a fatal erotic blow? What happens when they don't have
*  this conversation and they go elsewhere? And it's not just a conversation about monogamy. It's
*  really a conversation. What does sex mean to you? What do you want to experience in sex?
*  Is it a place for connection? Is it a place for transcendence, for spiritual union, to be naughty,
*  to finally not be a good citizen, to be playful, to be taken care of, to surrender, to be safely
*  dominant? What parts of you do you connect with through sexuality rather than how often do we have
*  sex and we never have sex and why don't we do it more? So that is a very different conversation.
*  But as Karen points to in her essay and as you certainly point to in your book, those conversations
*  are so difficult to have, even though, you know, this is the person we're supposed to be the closest
*  to. Why is that? Because we grow up learning to be silent about sex and never talk about it and then
*  suddenly we are expected to talk about it with the person we love. Or in other words, sex is dirty,
*  but save it for the one you love. It's like we have very little practice talking about it.
*  You know, we don't get any of it in schools. Certainly most families don't talk about it either.
*  And when we talk about sexuality, we talk about the dangers and the diseases and the dysfunctions.
*  We don't talk about intimacy. We don't actually mix the word sexuality and relationships as one
*  whole. Yeah. And I mean, if we don't talk about intimacy or the lack of it with a partner,
*  that can in some cases lead to people going outside the marriage to find that intimacy
*  they're lacking in it. You know, I'm thinking about Karen's favorite married man, the one with
*  all the tattoos. He says, it's not necessarily a lie. If you don't confess the truth, it's kinder
*  to stay silent. In your experience working with couples, is he right? Is that true?
*  This is a very cultural question. Because you live in a society here that believes in
*  the moral cure of truth. But there are many societies for whom truth and honesty are not
*  measured by the confession, but they are measured by what it will be like for the other person to
*  walk with this on the street. Meaning that, you know, they will consider the confession often as
*  cruelty. So what? So now you got it off your chest. So now you're less guilty and now I have to live
*  with this. Why don't you just keep this to yourself kind of thing? This is very cultural,
*  because in the United States, that is not the common view. The common view is that the confession
*  is the best state, even if you're going to wreck the other person's life for the next five years
*  to come. And I am left with a question mark. But when I answer this question, I ask people about
*  their own cultural codes as well. I do not impose mine and mine fluctuates depending on the context.
*  I think these questions are highly contextual, more than dogmatic. You know, we've talked about
*  how there's so many unsaid things between a couple that can lead to distance and infidelity.
*  If a couple is feeling themselves drifting apart from each other, emotionally, sexually, both,
*  what are some things you could encourage them to do that might help?
*  You know, I like to coach people to do letter writing. Sometimes I make one person turn their
*  back and I make the other person write a letter on the back of the other person.
*  Oh, physically on the back.
*  Yes, but it's a fake. You're pretending to write, but you're writing on the back,
*  but that way you don't see the person.
*  Interesting.
*  Hi, Anna. This is something that I've been wanting to talk to you for a long time.
*  And I give them the prompt. You know, we never talk much about sexuality between us.
*  For some reason, I decided a long time ago that you wouldn't want to, but maybe it was I who didn't
*  know how to. And basically, they write these whole letters in which they end up telling each other
*  much of what they have never spoken.
*  I love that. What a kind and beautiful and compassionate way of easing into a conversation
*  you've been afraid of having. Esther Perel, thank you so much for that idea. And thank
*  you for talking with me today.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  Esther Perel is on tour in the US right now. Her show was called An Evening with Esther Perel,
*  the Future of Relationships, Love and Desire. Check her website for more details and to buy
*  tickets. She told me she's going to create an erotic experience in these theaters,
*  so you do not want to miss that.
