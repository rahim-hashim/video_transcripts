# The U.S. Banned Spyware â€” and Then Kept Trying to Use It
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3iyyZzL_ZA)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  A little over a decade ago, a small Israeli company created what would become the world's
*  most powerful and notorious hacking tool.
*  Today, my colleague Mark Mazzetti on the surprising story of NSO and why, despite banning its
*  technology, the U.S. kept trying to use it.
*  It's Monday, May 15th.
*  So Mark, where does this investigation start for you?
*  I've been covering national security and intelligence issues for a number of years, and several
*  years ago, I became interested in this group of companies that were offering this new weapon,
*  a kind of hacking tool that could crack the iPhones that all of us carry around every day.
*  And what I thought was particularly interesting was that, whereas hacking tools were once
*  the purview of a small group of very powerful and wealthy countries, what these new companies
*  offered was to kind of democratize this in a way, right?
*  They gave every nation on Earth access to powerful hacking tools that they could just
*  sort of buy off the shelf.
*  And so the landscape of surveillance fundamentally changed.
*  Any country can buy this for the right price.
*  And pretty soon, it became apparent that there was one company that stood out from the rest,
*  and that was a company called NSO.
*  NSO was founded in Israel by three men who had done their military service, which is
*  mandatory in Israel, came out of the military, and they realized that they could recruit
*  from the ranks of these elite Israeli hackers who were coming out of these highly secretive
*  units of the Israeli intelligence services.
*  At a time when cyber warfare was becoming a big deal, and there was this recognition
*  that the skills that these people learned in the military and intelligence services
*  actually could be applied in the private sector.
*  And in 2011, the company unleashed this powerful tool called Pegasus.
*  Tell me about Pegasus.
*  What exactly does it do?
*  So what Pegasus does is it is able to penetrate smartphones and extract basically every bit
*  of data from the phone, whether it's photos, emails, messages, videos, basically anything
*  your phone Pegasus can get to.
*  And not only that, it can kind of reverse itself and turn your phone into a recording
*  device to record you.
*  And then that gets sent back to whomever is targeting you.
*  So it is both a tool that extracts information, but it's also a powerful spying tool in itself.
*  That's like James Bond.
*  So your phone actually becomes a device that spies on you.
*  Yes.
*  And most importantly, it finds its way around the problem of encryption.
*  And what I mean by that is one of the things that had bedeviled hackers was the fact that
*  there was this rise of encrypted information that if we have a phone call, if I send a
*  message, it was encrypted so that those who were trying to steal it couldn't steal it
*  because it would just be a bunch of gobbledygook.
*  What Pegasus did was find a way around encryption.
*  So any phone could be targeted, no matter whether it was using encrypted software or
*  not.
*  It's become incredibly appealing for governments to use for both good and for ill.
*  Basically any government that is trying to track people and get information are potential
*  clients, law enforcement services, intelligence services, police forces, that they could basically
*  sell this tool to governments around the world.
*  They sold it as this tool that could revolutionize espionage, revolutionize policing.
*  So the first client of NSO was the government of Mexico, which at the time then and now
*  is dealing with a major problem of narco traffickers.
*  And what they were particularly interested in was hacking the BlackBerrys of narco traffickers.
*  Okay.
*  This is a while ago.
*  Remember that?
*  Yes.
*  And so they signed a deal with NSO for Pegasus.
*  And there was soon enough a pretty big success, which was capturing the notorious drug trafficker,
*  Joaquin El Chapo Guzman.
*  So huge success.
*  I mean, that was a very famous high profile catch.
*  That was.
*  What soon happens though was that the Mexican government not only used it to go after the
*  people it was intended or sold on to go after, but it started going after journalists, political
*  dissidents, human rights activists, basically others that they saw as threats.
*  So it's becoming this double edged sword really in a way.
*  That's right.
*  But all the while, NSO is signing up new clients left and right.
*  And it's the sort of boom time for the company because it is taking its successes with its
*  previous clients using Pegasus and signing on new governments that are interested in
*  the powerful tool.
*  They even signed a deal for $55 million with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
*  And the Saudi government quickly used Pegasus as part of its broad campaign to crack down
*  on dissent inside and outside of Saudi Arabia.
*  There was even evidence that Pegasus was used to track the associates of Jamal Khashoggi,
*  the reporter who was killed in 2018.
*  In Istanbul famously, yes.
*  That's right.
*  And so this notoriety with Pegasus culminated in the summer of 2021.
*  This might sound like the plot of a Hollywood spy movie.
*  When a consortium of news organizations published what they called the Pegasus Project.
*  A group of media organizations has uncovered evidence of a massive spying effort.
*  Revealing how the hacking tool Pegasus has been used by governments around the world
*  to spy on dissidents and journalists via their mobile phones.
*  The project revealed a whole host of examples of abuse of Pegasus and ways that governments
*  had bought the tool for one reason, but used it for different purposes.
*  Big names have now been added to the list of possible targets.
*  French President Emmanuel Macron, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan.
*  Several members of Arab royal families, at least 65 business executives, 85 human rights
*  activists.
*  And it showed the use of Pegasus was far larger and more widespread than was ever known before.
*  The evidence would suggest that the company has been all too willing to sell its spyware
*  to repressive governments known to crush dissent.
*  It created a reaction across the globe.
*  Governments from India to Jordan to Morocco had to face new accusations that they were
*  spying on their own citizens.
*  And I think in many ways it crystallized this issue that had been percolating for many years.
*  And now it was revealed that this is a full-blown scandal.
*  So it was kind of a wake-up call in a lot of ways.
*  Like, hey guys, you know, these governments, yes, may be using this technology to find
*  terrorists and hunt down criminals, but also are using this technology to spy on their
*  own citizens, to take down human rights activists.
*  That's right.
*  These revelations really were a catalyst for Western governments calling for the end
*  of the use of these kind of tools.
*  And the Biden administration in the fall of 2021 takes this big step and it puts NSO
*  on a Commerce Department blacklist, which basically bans American companies from doing
*  business with NSO.
*  OK, so a bunch of countries, including the US, are taking this very principled position
*  that these tools are anti-democratic and should not be used.
*  So is that the end for NSO?
*  Is it dead at that point?
*  Well, it wasn't dead, but I'd say it was on life support.
*  But what my colleague Ronan Bergman and I were investigating at the time and have subsequently
*  revealed is that despite these public comments by the US and others about the threat that
*  NSO poses, the United States government was far deeper into NSO and Pegasus than it ever
*  wanted to let on.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Mark, you said that the US was far more involved with Pegasus than they ever had led
*  on publicly. What did you find?
*  Well, we found three main things.
*  The first is that despite this very public stance by the US government against NSO, the
*  FBI actually bought Pegasus back in 2019.
*  The FBI, like law enforcement agencies around the world, are looking for any tools they
*  can get to better surveil their targets.
*  Now, it might be possible that various intelligence agencies like the National Security Agency
*  might have tools that are similar to Pegasus, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're
*  sharing them with the FBI.
*  And so the FBI, to a degree, was seduced just like all these other countries were by the
*  power of Pegasus.
*  OK, so you reveal this connection between the FBI and Pegasus.
*  What was the fallout?
*  Well, after we reported it, the FBI director, Chris Wray, had to testify before Congress
*  about why the FBI had purchased the tool and did it ever get used.
*  And what Wray said was we mostly purchased this just to see how bad guys might use it.
*  Like, we're the FBI.
*  Our job is to sort of study how bad guys operate.
*  And we bought it to, in essence, sort of reverse engineer it and just sort of see how it works.
*  But through a Freedom of Information Act request, we got a whole lot of documents from the FBI.
*  And it tells a different story.
*  What the documents show is that the FBI got pretty close to actually deploying Pegasus.
*  And there was a lot of interest in parts of the FBI to use it in FBI investigations to
*  go after the targets of the FBI.
*  There were memos circulated.
*  There were briefings to a pretty high level of the FBI.
*  And there was even discussion of, well, how would you represent to a judge that you'd
*  use Pegasus as part of your investigations?
*  Is any of this legal?
*  So it's a very interesting window into the FBI sort of looking at a new tool and trying
*  to figure out about whether it could use it.
*  Okay, so the first takeaway is that the FBI actually got a lot closer to using Pegasus
*  than it seemed from the director's public comments.
*  What was the second thing you found?
*  We found that there was this pretty aggressive campaign by NSO and the private equity firm
*  that owns NSO to kind of Americanize the company.
*  In other words, take the tools that NSO would become famous for and strip it away from the
*  scandal and just take those tools and be able to sell them to American law enforcement,
*  intelligence agencies and the closest partners of the United States.
*  Okay, so what happens?
*  What do they end up doing?
*  So NSO set up kind of an American holding company that is tasked only with trying to
*  find American government clients for Pegasus and the other NSO tools.
*  And they actually found someone.
*  So not long after the Biden administration decides to blacklist NSO, the company starts
*  having discussions with a big defense firm called L3 Harris.
*  And L3 Harris specializes in this kind of hacking and electronic warfare stuff.
*  And L3 Harris clearly saw the potential benefits of taking over these tools that so many governments
*  around the world had wanted to buy.
*  But how did they get around the blacklist?
*  They had to try to convince the government to take them off the blacklist.
*  So another Freedom of Information Act request we put in was to the Commerce Department.
*  And what we found in those documents was that L3 Harris pretty aggressively lobbied
*  the Commerce Department.
*  And in meetings and emails, they had a pretty big Washington law firm advance their cause
*  with the clear aim of basically putting this in stark terms.
*  This is an American national security issue.
*  So they went pretty hard at trying to, it seems from the documents, get NSO off the
*  blacklist because that would have seemed to have been a prerequisite before they bought it.
*  And so these talks go ahead until they leak out in the middle of last year.
*  There are some reports that L3 is in talks to purchase NSO.
*  And pretty much immediately, the White House puts its foot down and say, no, we're not
*  And say, no defense firm should think that just by purchasing a blacklisted company,
*  that we don't worry about those tools anymore, that the company gets off the blacklist.
*  So in other words, hey, L3 Harris, don't think that you can pull a fast one here.
*  We are on to you and we're not going to let this happen.
*  The White House steps in, says, stop your lobbying.
*  We don't want to have this.
*  This is not going to happen.
*  Right.
*  And that effectively killed the deal.
*  Okay.
*  So now NSO was trying to revive itself.
*  Again, it fails.
*  So what's the third thing you found?
*  The third thing we found kind of takes us right up to the present day.
*  We kept learning of other parts of the US government that had some interest in these
*  kinds of tools.
*  And we came across a contract that interestingly was signed just days after the Biden administration
*  put NSO on a blacklist.
*  So wait, even after the government swore off working with NSO, it had signed a deal with
*  the company?
*  Well, yes.
*  So the contract is between NSO and this American firm that the FBI had used a couple years
*  ago to purchase Pegasus.
*  And in the contract, it says quite explicitly that the US government is the end user of
*  this product.
*  And what the product is, is it's another NSO tool to help track people around the world.
*  It's called Landmark.
*  And from our reporting, we found out that this contract was still active and it had
*  been used to target phone numbers in Mexico.
*  And when we went to the White House, they said it was news to them that they didn't
*  know about this active contract with NSO.
*  So it became this big mystery.
*  Okay.
*  So maybe one hand doesn't know what the other hand is doing, but it also could be a case
*  of, you know, the technology is just so good.
*  Like we can't resist it.
*  We're addicted to it.
*  Like we can't resist letting bad guys use it when we have the chance to get in there
*  and use it as well.
*  I think if you look at these tools, kind of like weapons as we have, you know, history
*  has shown that powerful weapons are coveted by powerful governments around the world.
*  And governments that have them don't want to give them up.
*  And those that don't have them want to get them.
*  And so I think this is just another example of that phenomenon, that these tools, which
*  give governments an enormous amount of power to spy on people around the world, they're
*  not only coveted, but they're not going away.
*  Already, we've reported that there's another Israeli company, one called Paragon, that
*  the US is using.
*  It's very similar to NSO.
*  It doesn't have the reputational baggage.
*  But when we went to the White House and said, OK, do you have a problem with this company?
*  They said, well, no, there's no history of its tools being abused.
*  So for now, we're OK with it.
*  So kind of like nuclear weapons, right?
*  Like on some level, we all think to ourselves, this is a very bad idea.
*  I mean, it can only lead to bad outcomes.
*  But somebody creates it and there's a lot of public hand-wringing, but then everybody
*  wants it.
*  And the next thing we know, we're in an arms race.
*  We're in an arms race.
*  And the interesting thing is, unlike nuclear weapons, which were so powerful that eventually
*  sort of a whole group of rules developed about when you might use them, in this case, these
*  are sort of so easy to deploy.
*  And you can do it without sort of having any fingerprints of you deploying them.
*  So it's sort of lowered the bar even more for governments to want to use them.
*  In other words, there really aren't any repercussions for governments to use these weapons.
*  Right.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  Three months after devastating earthquakes killed more than 50,000 people, voters in
*  Turkey went to the polls on Sunday in what was a referendum on the country's populist
*  leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
*  Preliminary results released by Turkey's election board early Monday show that Erdogan
*  had 49.5% of the vote and his main challenger, Kemal Kilicdarolu, had 44.8%.
*  If neither candidate wins an outright majority, as looked likely early Monday, they will go
*  to a runoff at the end of May.
*  It is the closest challenge to Erdogan's rule since he took power in Turkey, a member
*  of NATO and a US ally, 20 years ago.
*  He faced an extremely tight race, largely because of anger at the state of the economy
*  and concerns among many voters that he has pushed the country toward autocracy.
*  And President Vladimir Zelensky of Ukraine met with Germany's leaders in Berlin on Sunday.
*  His latest stop on a diplomatic tour aimed at shoring up support among Western allies
*  and pushing for faster deliveries of weapons as a Ukrainian counteroffensive looms.
*  The visit followed meetings with Pope Francis and the Italian Prime Minister and came as
*  Germany pledged nearly $3 billion in fresh assistance for Ukraine, an arms package that
*  amounted to as much as Germany has given since the war began.
*  Zelensky ended his tour of European capitals in Paris on Sunday evening, where he dined
*  with French President Emmanuel Macron.
*  Today's episode was produced by Asda Chaturvedi, Rochelle Banja and Mary Wilson, with help from
