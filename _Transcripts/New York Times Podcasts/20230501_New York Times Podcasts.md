# Kevin McCarthyâ€™s Debt Ceiling Dilemma
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yfuhb4CReTQ)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is a daily.
*  Today.
*  For Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, the looming crisis over the U.S. debt ceiling
*  may soon require him to make a painful choice, prevent a financial catastrophe, or keep his
*  job.
*  Congressional reporter Katie Edmondson explains.
*  It's Monday, May 1st.
*  Katie, the last time we had you on the show, it was back in January, and Kevin McCarthy
*  and the new, very narrow House Republican majority had just finished a grueling fight
*  over the speakership.
*  And that fight pitted McCarthy against the most hard-line conservatives in the House
*  who wanted to extract concessions from him before they would vote for him as Speaker.
*  And as we know, McCarthy ultimately won that fight by making those concessions the most
*  notable of them, being that any one member of the House could call a vote to basically
*  fire McCarthy as Speaker at any time, which effectively put him at the mercy of the same
*  wing of his party, who he had the hardest time winning over.
*  And the question coming out of all of that was whether Speaker McCarthy could ever truly
*  rule this unruly group of Republicans, or whether he was basically doomed as Speaker
*  from the start.
*  And over the past few days, it feels like we've started to get an answer.
*  We did.
*  We saw an early test balloon floated, essentially, and it was on a really high stakes issue.
*  It was on the fight over raising the debt ceiling.
*  And just remind us of the basics of that fight.
*  I know it is a complicated subject, a slightly academic subject, but just walk us through it.
*  At some point over the summer, we don't know exactly when, but we're estimating maybe by
*  June, the government is going to hit the limit of how much money it can borrow in order to
*  fund government operations.
*  And so Congress is going to have to pass, and then the White House is going to have
*  to sign a bill raising that limit.
*  If Congress doesn't raise the debt ceiling, the United States can't borrow anymore and
*  the government stops working.
*  It can't pay its bills.
*  Right.
*  And that's why the government raises the debt ceiling time after time after time, because
*  everybody of both parties traditionally is pretty invested in making sure the government
*  can pay its bills and that it doesn't default on its debt.
*  That's right.
*  A default would invite catastrophic economic consequences.
*  But what we have seen over the past several years is that Republicans often decide to
*  try to weaponize the issue, particularly when there is a Democrat in the White House.
*  They've held up the debt ceiling as a tool, essentially, to try to force a confrontation
*  with Democrats in the White House and to try to get them to swallow deep spending cuts.
*  And that is where House Republicans are right now.
*  They have told the White House essentially, we're not going to do this the easy way.
*  We're not going to just lift the debt ceiling for nothing.
*  If you want our votes in order to avoid a default, then you are going to have to negotiate
*  with us and you are going to have to take on some of our demands, which in this case
*  is broadly deep spending cuts.
*  House Republicans think that federal spending is out of control and they want to wind that
*  down.
*  And so that left this question of would House Republicans be able to coalesce and unite
*  around some type of opening offer to negotiate with the White House on?
*  Right.
*  Would McCarthy as speaker be able to persuade all these Republicans, especially these conservative
*  Republicans, to get on the same page?
*  Or would it devolve into the kind of ugly spectacle we saw surrounding his election
*  as speaker?
*  That's exactly right.
*  We know that it is a tiny majority that Kevin McCarthy has.
*  He's given a lot of power to the hard right lawmakers who are the ones who really want
*  to see very deep spending cuts here.
*  And so that type of messy spectacle is exactly what Kevin McCarthy had been trying really
*  hard to avoid.
*  He wanted to be able to get his conference behind just one single proposal.
*  And how in light of that truly messy speaker's race does he go about trying to do that, to
*  get everyone on the same page on the death ceiling?
*  Well, at first, their efforts kind of fail.
*  They initially had an idea that they were going to lay out this grand budget proposal
*  and they were going to lay out all of the cuts that they were going to demand in exchange
*  for lifting the debt ceiling and that ultimately that budget at the end of the day was going
*  to balance the nation's budget in 10 years, which is an extremely ambitious feat.
*  They ultimately weren't able to get there.
*  There was too much infighting.
*  The math didn't quite work.
*  And so instead, House Republican leaders pivot and they say, well, instead of laying out
*  this large grand budget, why don't we put together a piece of legislation that lays
*  out some of the terms that we will ask the White House to agree to in order for us to
*  vote to raise the debt ceiling?
*  So something far less ambitious, but with the same theoretical endpoint of communicating
*  to the White House what it would take to lift the debt ceiling.
*  Exactly.
*  The thing is, even getting his members united around that more modest proposal is not easy
*  for Speaker McCarthy.
*  He particularly has to win over, again, really the same group of conservatives that we talked
*  about back in January, because there is a critical block of hard-right lawmakers in
*  his conference who just do not want to raise the debt ceiling really under any circumstances
*  and in fact pride themselves on the fact that they've never voted to do that ever.
*  And so he really sets out to do that in a couple of ways.
*  And one of those ways is to really try to bring them into the fold, to make them feel
*  like members of the team.
*  I think in a lot of past Republican speakerships, we've seen Republican leaders keep conservatives
*  at an arm's length.
*  And that's because traditionally those lawmakers have raised hell for Republican speakers.
*  And so rather than trying to marginalize them or push them out, McCarthy actually brings
*  them in and makes a point of courting their votes, listening to their concerns, making
*  them feel heard.
*  And the other portion of this is that he says to them, look, this is about bringing President
*  Biden to the negotiating table.
*  We have to keep our focus on making sure that the political pressure is on Biden here, our
*  political enemy.
*  Right?
*  He's the enemy, not me.
*  And he tells them, essentially, if you guys don't vote for this, if we can't show that
*  we have the votes to pass our own proposal, then you guys are going to be cutting my legs
*  out from under me.
*  Because when I go to the negotiating table with President Biden, he'll think I'm completely
*  weak.
*  Right.
*  And so ultimately, after, I mean, really weeks, essentially, of McCarthy courting these lawmakers,
*  bringing them into the fold, doing some arm twisting, some flattery, he believes that
*  he has the votes to pass this bill.
*  And he decides he's going to put it to the floor for an up or down vote.
*  Now to Capitol Hill, where House Republicans are set to hold a key vote on the debt ceiling
*  today.
*  The problem is, it's not clear.
*  McCarthy has the votes from his own Republicans.
*  Are Republicans going to pass this bill or not?
*  And I have to tell you, Michael, it's very rare for congressional leadership to schedule
*  a vote on a bill without being absolutely sure that it's going to pass.
*  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy can only afford to lose four potential GOP votes to pass the
*  bill.
*  So how many holdouts are there, yourself included?
*  Twice that.
*  I'm leaning against voting for it at this time.
*  Every program has got to be frozen.
*  We can't allow programs to grow six, eight, 10 percent.
*  I'm voting no.
*  But on Wednesday afternoon, there, all of us reporters were sitting in the House chamber
*  looking at every possible holdout to see how they were voting.
*  We were watching whipping happen on the House floor as the vote was going on.
*  And at the end of the day, the yeas are 217, the nays are 215, the bill is passed.
*  McCarthy had the votes.
*  So several hard right Republicans who do not ever make compromises of any kind made a
*  compromise here.
*  Exactly.
*  That's why this was such a big deal.
*  So for Speaker McCarthy, this is a real accomplishment.
*  Yeah, I think that's right.
*  I think you have to give credit where credit is due.
*  And I mean, look, you started the year in hellish circumstances with these hard right
*  lawmakers subjecting him to a humiliating vote after humiliating vote.
*  And here on something that actually really matters on a matter of policy, he kept his
*  conference largely united.
*  Right. He delivered.
*  OK, let's turn to what's actually in this bill.
*  What have all these House Republicans demanded in return for actually raising the
*  debt ceiling? So first and foremost, they're calling for sweeping spending cuts,
*  essentially a 14 percent cut over the next decade.
*  And it takes aim at several of the key accomplishments of the Biden administration.
*  So far, it would look to claw back some of the climate measures he was able to pass
*  through Congress.
*  It would claw back money that he had appropriated to the IRS to try to improve
*  enforcement of the highest earners, make sure that they were paying their fair share
*  of taxes. They also are trying to increase work requirements for recipients of social
*  programs, federal social programs like food stamps and Medicaid, which are two programs
*  the Democrats have fiercely defended.
*  And it would also roll back his executive order for giving student loan debt.
*  So if you're President Biden, this Republican plan to get the debt ceiling lifted now
*  looks like a plan to more or less gut your domestic agenda, and it probably looks
*  extremely painful.
*  That's right. The message here that Republicans have sent to President Biden is that if
*  you want our votes to raise the debt ceiling, then you, President Biden, are going to
*  have to give us a pound of flesh.
*  And the White House and Democrats, I think we're really hoping or maybe expecting that
*  House Republicans were going to be in complete disarray, that they are going to be beset
*  by infighting and maybe never really coalesce around a starting negotiating position.
*  And I think the fantasy, honestly, was that then House Republicans would simply have to
*  raise the debt ceiling if they couldn't come up with a solution of their own.
*  And that's why it was so important for Speaker McCarthy to get the votes to pass a
*  Republican opening bid, because it essentially forces President Biden to come to the
*  negotiating table.
*  Right. Basically, McCarthy was able to convince these conservative Republicans to focus
*  on Biden. And by focusing on Biden rather than on fighting with McCarthy, they have
*  forced Biden to now sit down with them and negotiate.
*  That's right. Just as it took me 15 rounds to win speaker, the one thing I have
*  promised the American public, I will never give up on you.
*  And they have done all this work to get to the hard part.
*  You've underestimated us.
*  We've done our job.
*  The only body in here that's done theirs.
*  McCarthy is going to have to negotiate with the White House.
*  He's going to have to negotiate with Democrats.
*  And he's going to have to come back to his conference with some sort of compromise.
*  And that is going to be the test for him and for his speakership.
*  I've sat down with the president on February 1st.
*  He ignored the rest of the time.
*  Now he should sit down and negotiate.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Katie, let's now turn to this hard part, these negotiations between Republicans and
*  the White House. What are Democrats?
*  What is the president saying about this debt ceiling bill?
*  What has been their reaction to this platter of cuts and rollbacks from House Republicans?
*  Well, unsurprisingly, Democrats absolutely hate it.
*  Speaker McCarthy and House Republicans want to force working Americans to accept either
*  a punch to the gut or a blow to the head.
*  Chuck Schumer has taken to the Senate floor numerous times to rebrand it.
*  It might as well be called the Default on America Act because that's exactly what it
*  is. DOA.
*  Their argument is the spending cuts that House Republicans are lobbying for are going to
*  hurt popular federal programs that help veterans, that help the working class.
*  Their argument is that these new work requirements for social programs that Republicans
*  want to impose are really taking aim at the most vulnerable in society.
*  Either the U.S. defaults on national debt for the first time in American history or
*  MAGA Republicans get their way and America defaults on everything else.
*  They say that this is a cruel bill that they cannot allow to pass.
*  And it does up the political pressure for President Biden to sit down at the negotiating
*  table with Speaker McCarthy.
*  I guess I'm curious, though, Katie, what if President Biden just said, no, I will not
*  negotiate with you.
*  And here's why. I don't think that raising the debt ceiling should have any strings
*  attached to it. I just want you to raise the debt ceiling period.
*  And I won't have a conversation about doing that if it involves any of these spending
*  cuts or policy rollbacks.
*  What would theoretically happen if he did that as a tactic?
*  Well, the problem with that strategy is it seems extremely plausible that there would
*  be a number of hard right Republicans who would be more than happy to call his bluff,
*  who would hold fast to their pledge not to raise the debt ceiling without any conditions.
*  And that would force us into a default, which our colleagues who cover the economy have
*  said would have dramatic, disastrous economic consequences globally.
*  And aside from all of the economic pain that would cause, there's also the fact that
*  President Biden has announced his reelection campaign and what president wants to run
*  for reelection during a recession.
*  So given that, what do we expect these negotiations to actually look like?
*  How much do we expect everyone to move toward each other?
*  Well, as with any negotiations, both sides theoretically have to start inching toward
*  the middle to find some sort of common ground.
*  And that is where the dynamics become incredibly dangerous for Speaker McCarthy, because
*  he is going to have to negotiate with a White House, with Senate Democrats who will
*  absolutely not swallow some of the demands his conference has stipulated.
*  And so at the end of the day, whatever deal he strikes with Democrats is going to be a
*  watered down version of the bill he just barely was able to pass.
*  And he is going to have to take that watered down product back to his conference, including
*  the incredibly conservative lawmakers he's been able to appease so far and sell them on
*  this product, get them to vote on this deal.
*  And because his majority is so narrow, as we've talked about with you, if just a
*  handful of conservative House Republicans say, no, I will not agree to a watered down
*  bill to raise a debt ceiling, then McCarthy won't have enough votes to pass this
*  watered down bill.
*  And then what?
*  Well, in that situation, at least the White House and Senate Democrats hope that a few
*  moderate Republicans might be willing to vote for this watered down solution.
*  But then Democrats would essentially come in and bail McCarthy out and McCarthy would
*  be able to pass this deal by leaning on lawmakers in the opposing party.
*  And that obviously would be politically catastrophic for him as Speaker.
*  Just explain that, why that's politically catastrophic.
*  It would be a political catastrophe for him because he would essentially be ignoring the
*  will of his own members to raise the debt ceiling, something they don't want using
*  Democratic votes, votes from the opposing party, the enemy party.
*  Right.
*  A betrayal.
*  Exactly.
*  And it is not hard to imagine in those circumstances that at least one lawmaker would
*  be so incensed by this act of betrayal that they would move to try to oust McCarthy
*  from the speakership, as any one lawmaker is now able to do as a result of the concessions
*  McCarthy made to become speaker in the first place.
*  In other words, lifting the debt ceiling and sparing us all an economic catastrophe is
*  almost guaranteed in one way or another to imperil Kevin McCarthy's speakership.
*  A speakership he barely got in the first place.
*  Well, look, after he won this floor vote, passing Republicans' opening offer in these
*  negotiations, Speaker McCarthy came off the House floor and he said, you see, I had it.
*  You guys always underestimate me.
*  Don't underestimate me.
*  And so it is possible that there is a world in which he is able to pull this off, to
*  raise the debt ceiling and keep all of his members happy.
*  But there are also two other really grim scenarios.
*  One is that he can't pull it off.
*  We don't raise the debt ceiling and we default.
*  And the other is that in order to avert that economic catastrophe, he has to essentially
*  sacrifice his job as speaker and use Democratic votes to get it done.
*  Katie, thank you very much.
*  Thanks, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Over the weekend, federal regulators took over First Republic Bank of San Francisco and
*  First Republic Bank of San Francisco in their latest attempt to end the crisis among
*  regional banks that began in March.
*  The decision marks the third time in the past two months that regulators have seized a
*  bank because of its weak finances.
*  Regulators took over Silicon Valley Bank on March 10th and Signature Bank two days
*  later. First Republic's problems became insurmountable last week when it disclosed
*  that customers had pulled out half of the bank's money.
*  News that sent its stock price plunging about 75 percent.
