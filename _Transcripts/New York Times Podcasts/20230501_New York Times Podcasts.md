*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro.
*  This is the Daily.
*  Today, for Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, the looming crisis over the U.S.
*  debt ceiling may soon require him to make a painful choice, prevent a financial catastrophe,
*  or keep his job.
*  Congressional reporter Katie Edmondson explains,
*  it's Monday May 1st.
*  The last time we had you on the show, it was back in January, and Kevin McCarthy and
*  the new, very narrow House Republican majority had just finished a grueling fight over the
*  speakership.
*  And that fight pitted McCarthy against the most hard-line conservatives in the House who
*  wanted to extract concessions from him before they would vote for him as Speaker.
*  And as we know, McCarthy ultimately won that fight by making those concessions the most
*  notable of them, being that any one member of the House could call a vote to basically
*  fire McCarthy as Speaker at any time, which effectively put him at the mercy of the same
*  wing of his party who he had the hardest time winning over.
*  And the question coming out of all of that was whether Speaker McCarthy could ever truly
*  rule this unruly group of Republicans or whether he was basically doomed as Speaker
*  from the start.
*  And over the past few days, it feels like we've started to get an answer.
*  We did.
*  We saw an early test balloon floated essentially, and it was on a really high stakes issue.
*  It was on the fight over raising the debt ceiling.
*  And just remind us of the basics of that fight.
*  I know it is a complicated subject, a slightly academic subject, but just walk us through
*  it.
*  At some point over the summer, we don't know exactly when, but we're estimating maybe
*  by June, the government is going to hit the limit of how much money it can borrow in order
*  to fund government operations.
*  And so Congress is going to have to pass.
*  And then the White House is going to have to sign a bill raising that limit.
*  If Congress doesn't raise the debt ceiling, the United States can't borrow anymore and
*  the government stops working.
*  It can't pay its bills.
*  Right.
*  Which is why the government raises the debt ceiling time after time after time because
*  everybody of both parties traditionally is pretty invested in making sure the government
*  can pay its bills and that it doesn't default on its debt.
*  That's right.
*  A default would invite catastrophic economic consequences.
*  But what we have seen over the past several years is that Republicans often decide to try
*  to weaponize the issue, particularly when there is a Democrat in the White House.
*  They have held up the debt ceiling as a tool essentially to try to force a confrontation
*  with Democrats in the White House and to try to get them to swallow deep spending cuts.
*  And that is where House Republicans are right now.
*  They have told the White House essentially we're not going to do this the easy way.
*  We're not going to just lift the debt ceiling for nothing.
*  If you want our votes in order to avoid a default, then you are going to have to negotiate
*  with us and you are going to have to take on some of our demands.
*  Which in this case is broadly deep spending cuts.
*  House Republicans think that federal spending is out of control and they want to wind that
*  down.
*  And so that left this question of would House Republicans be able to coalesce in unite
*  around some type of opening offer to negotiate with the White House on?
*  Right.
*  Would McCarthy as speaker be able to persuade all these Republicans, especially these conservative
*  Republicans, to get on the same page or would it devolve into the kind of ugly spectacle
*  we saw surrounding his election as speaker?
*  That's exactly right.
*  We know that it is a tiny majority that Kevin McCarthy has.
*  He's given a lot of power to the hard right lawmakers who are the ones who really want
*  to see very deep spending cuts here.
*  And so that type of messy spectacle is exactly what Kevin McCarthy had been trying really
*  hard to avoid.
*  He wanted to be able to get his conference behind just one single proposal.
*  And how in light of that truly messy speaker's race, does he go about trying to do that?
*  To get everyone on the same page on the debt ceiling?
*  Well, at first their efforts kind of fail.
*  They initially had an idea that they were going to lay out this grand budget proposal.
*  And they were going to lay out all of the cuts that they were going to demand in exchange
*  for lifting the debt ceiling.
*  And that ultimately that budget at the end of the day was going to balance the nation's
*  budget in 10 years, which is an extremely ambitious feat.
*  They ultimately weren't able to get there.
*  There was too much infighting.
*  The math didn't quite work.
*  And so instead House Republican leaders pivot and they say, well, instead of laying out
*  this large grand budget, why don't we put together a piece of legislation that lays out
*  some of the terms that we will ask the White House to agree to in order for us to vote
*  to raise the debt ceiling?
*  So something far less ambitious, but with the same theoretical endpoint of communicating
*  to the White House, what it would take to lift the debt ceiling?
*  Exactly.
*  And the thing is, even getting his members united around that more modest proposal is not
*  easy for Speaker McCarthy.
*  He particularly has to win over, again, really the same group of conservatives that we talked
*  about back in January, because there is a critical block of hard right lawmakers in his conference
*  who just do not want to raise the debt ceiling really under any circumstances and in fact
*  pride themselves on the fact that they've never voted to do that ever.
*  And so he really sets out to do that in a couple of ways.
*  And one of those ways is to really try to bring them into the fold to make them feel like
*  members of the team.
*  I think in a lot of past Republican speakerships we've seen Republican leaders keep conservatives
*  at an armed length and that's because traditionally those lawmakers have raised health for Republican
*  speakers.
*  And so rather than trying to marginalize them or push them out, McCarthy actually brings
*  them in and makes a point of courting their votes, listening to their concerns, making
*  them feel heard.
*  And the other portion of this is that he says to them, look, this is about bringing President
*  Biden to the negotiating table.
*  We have to keep our focus on making sure that the political pressure is unbidened here,
*  our political enemy.
*  Right?
*  He's the enemy, not me.
*  And he tells them essentially if you guys don't vote for this, if we can't show that we
*  have the votes to pass our own proposal, then you guys are going to be cutting my legs out
*  from under me because when I go to the negotiating table with President Biden, he'll think I'm
*  completely weak.
*  Right.
*  And so ultimately after, I mean, really weeks essentially of McCarthy courting these lawmakers,
*  bringing them into the fold, doing some arm twistings, some flattery, he believes
*  that he has the votes to pass this bill and he decides he's going to put it to the
*  floor for an up or down vote.
*  Now, to Capitol Hill, where House Republicans are set to hold a key vote on the debt ceiling
*  today.
*  The problem is it's not clear McCarthy has the votes from his own Republicans.
*  Are Republicans going to pass this bill or not?
*  And I have to tell you, Michael, it's very rare for congressional leadership to schedule
*  a vote on a bill without being absolutely sure that it's going to pass.
*  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy can only afford to lose four potential GOP votes to pass the
*  bill.
*  So how many holdouts are there yourself included?
*  Twice that.
*  I'm leaning against voting for it at this time.
*  Every program has got to be frozen.
*  We can't allow programs to grow 6, 8, 10%.
*  I'm voting no.
*  And on Wednesday afternoon, all of us reporters were sitting in the House chamber looking
*  at every possible holdout to see how they were voting.
*  You're watching whipping happen on the House floor as the vote was going on.
*  And at the end of the day, the days are 217, the days are 215, the bill is passed.
*  McCarthy had the votes.
*  So several hard right Republicans who do not ever make compromises of any kind made
*  a compromise here.
*  Exactly.
*  That's why this was such a big deal.
*  So for Speaker McCarthy, this is a real accomplishment.
*  Yeah, I think that's right.
*  I think you have to give credit where credit is due.
*  And I mean, look, you started the year in hellish circumstances with these hard right lawmakers
*  subjecting him to a humiliating vote after humiliating vote.
*  And here on something that actually really matters on a matter of policy, he kept his
*  conference largely united.
*  Right.
*  He delivered.
*  Okay, let's turn to what's actually in this bill.
*  What have all these House Republicans demanded in return for actually raising the debt ceiling?
*  So first and foremost, they're calling for sweeping spending cuts, essentially a 14%
*  cut over the next decade.
*  Wow.
*  And it makes aim at several of the key accomplishments of the Biden administration so far.
*  It would look to claw back some of the climate measures he was able to pass through Congress.
*  It would claw back money that he had appropriated to the IRS to try to improve enforcement of
*  the highest earners, make sure that they were paying their fair share of taxes.
*  They also are trying to increase work requirements for recipients of social programs, federal social
*  programs like food stamps and Medicaid, which are two programs the Democrats have fiercely
*  defended.
*  And it would also roll back his executive order for giving student loan debt.
*  So if you're president Biden, this Republican plan to get the debt ceiling lifted now
*  looks like a plan to more or less gut your domestic agenda.
*  And it probably looks extremely painful.
*  That's right.
*  The message here that Republicans have sent to President Biden is that if you want our
*  votes to raise the debt ceiling, then you, President Biden, are going to have to give
*  us a pound of flesh.
*  And the White House and Democrats, I think we're really hoping or maybe expecting that
*  House Republicans were going to be in complete disarray that they are going to be beset
*  by infighting and maybe never really coalesce around a starting negotiating position.
*  And I think the fantasy, honestly, was that then House Republicans would simply have to
*  raise the debt ceiling if they couldn't come up with a solution of their own.
*  And that's why it was so important for Speaker McCarthy to get the votes to pass a Republican
*  opening bid because it essentially forces President Biden to come to the negotiating table.
*  Right.
*  Basically McCarthy was able to convince these conservative Republicans to focus on Biden.
*  And by focusing on Biden, rather than on fighting with McCarthy, they have forced Biden to
*  now sit down with them and negotiate.
*  That's right.
*  Just as it took me 15 rounds to win Speaker, the one thing I have promised America public,
*  I will never give up on you.
*  And they have done all this work to get to the hard part.
*  You've underestimated us.
*  We've done our job, the only body in here that's done theirs.
*  McCarthy is going to have to negotiate with the White House.
*  He's going to have to negotiate with Democrats.
*  And he's going to have to come back to his conference with some sort of compromise.
*  And that is going to be the test for him and for his speakership.
*  I've sat down with the President February 1st, ignored the rest of the time.
*  Now he should sit down and negotiate.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Katie, let's now turn to this hard part, these negotiations between Republicans and
*  the White House.
*  What are Democrats?
*  What is the President saying about this debt ceiling bill?
*  What has been their reaction to this platter of cuts and rollbacks from House Republicans?
*  Well unsurprisingly, Democrats absolutely hated.
*  Senator McCarthy and House Republicans want a force working Americans to accept either
*  a punch to the gut or a blow to the head.
*  Chuck Schumer has taken to the Senate floor numerous times to rebrand it.
*  It might as well be called the default on America Act because that's exactly what it is.
*  D-O-A.
*  Instead of doing what both sides are doing.
*  Their argument is the spending cuts that House Republicans are lobbying for are going to
*  hurt popular federal programs that help veterans that help the working class.
*  Their argument is that these new work requirements for social programs that Republicans want
*  to impose are really taking aim at the most vulnerable in society.
*  Either the U.S. defaults on national debt for the first time in American history or
*  mega Republicans get their way and America defaults on everything else.
*  They say that this is a cruel bill that they cannot allow to pass.
*  It does up the political pressure for President Biden to sit down at the negotiating table
*  with Speaker McCarthy.
*  I guess I'm curious, though, Katie.
*  What if President Biden just said, no, I will not negotiate with you.
*  And here's why.
*  I don't think that raising the debt ceiling should have any strings attached to it.
*  I just want you to raise the debt ceiling period and I won't have a conversation about
*  doing that if it involves any of these spending cuts or policy robots.
*  What would theoretically happen if he did that as a tactic?
*  Well, the problem with that strategy is it seems extremely plausible that there would be
*  a number of hard right Republicans who would be more than happy to call his bluff, who
*  would hold fast to their pledge not to raise the debt ceiling without any conditions.
*  And that would force us into a default which our colleagues who cover the economy have
*  said would have dramatic disastrous economic consequences globally.
*  And aside from all of the economic pain that would cause, there's also the fact that President
*  Biden has announced his reelection campaign.
*  And what President wants to run for reelection during a recession.
*  So given that, what do we expect these negotiations to actually look like?
*  How much do we expect everyone to move toward each other?
*  Well, as with any negotiations, both sides theoretically have to start inching toward the
*  middle to find some sort of common ground.
*  And that is where the dynamics become incredibly dangerous for Speaker McCarthy because he is
*  going to have to negotiate with a White House with Senate Democrats who will absolutely
*  not swallow some of the demands his conference has stipulated.
*  And so at the end of the day, whatever deal he strikes with Democrats is going to be
*  a watered down version of the bill he just barely was able to pass.
*  And he is going to have to take that watered down product back to his conference, including
*  the incredibly conservative lawmakers.
*  He's been able to appeal so far and sell them on this product, get them to vote on this
*  deal.
*  And because his majority is so narrow, as we've talked about with you, if just a handful
*  of conservative House Republicans say no, I will not agree to a watered down bill to
*  raise a debt ceiling, then McCarthy won't have enough votes to pass this watered down bill.
*  And then what?
*  Well, in that situation, actually, the White House and Senate Democrats hope that a few
*  moderate Republicans might be willing to vote for this watered down solution, but then
*  Democrats would essentially come in and bail McCarthy out.
*  And McCarthy would be able to pass this deal by leaning on lawmakers and the opposing party.
*  And that obviously would be politically catastrophic for him as Speaker.
*  Just explain that.
*  Why that's politically catastrophic?
*  It would be a political catastrophe for him because he would essentially be ignoring the
*  will of his own members to raise the debt ceiling, something they don't want using
*  Democratic votes, votes from the opposing party, the enemy party.
*  Right, a betrayal.
*  Exactly.
*  And it is not hard to imagine in those circumstances that actually used one lawmaker would be so
*  incensed by this act of betrayal that they would move to try to oust McCarthy from the
*  Speakership.
*  As anyone lawmaker is now able to do as a result of the concessions McCarthy made to become
*  the Speaker in the first place.
*  In other words, lifting the debt ceiling and sparing us all an economic catastrophe is
*  almost guaranteed in one way or another to imperil Kevin McCarthy's Speakership.
*  A Speakership he barely got in the first place.
*  Well, look after he won this floor vote passing Republicans opening off in these negotiations.
*  Speaker McCarthy came off the House floor and he said, you see, I had it.
*  You guys always underestimate me.
*  Don't underestimate me.
*  And so it is possible that there is a world in which he is able to pull this off to raise
*  the debt ceiling and keep all of his members happy.
*  But there are also two other really grim scenarios.
*  One is that he can't pull it off.
*  We don't raise the debt ceiling and we default.
*  And the other is that in order to overt that economic catastrophe, he has to essentially
*  sacrifice his job as Speaker and use democratic votes to get it done.
*  Katie, thank you very much.
*  Thanks, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Over the weekend, federal regulators took over first Republic Bank of San Francisco in their
*  latest attempt to end the crisis among regional banks that began in March.
*  The decision marks the third time in the past two months that regulators have seized a bank
*  because of its weak finances.
*  Regulators took over Silicon Valley Bank on March 10th and Signature Bank two days later.
*  First Republic's problems became insurmountable last week when it disclosed that customers had pulled
*  out half of the bank's money, news that sent its stock price plunging about 75 percent.
