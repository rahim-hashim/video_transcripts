*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavarnese, and I'm Michael Borgal.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, two stories.
*  First, my colleague Pam Bellock on why any day now, a federal judge in Texas could issue
*  an order to ban the pill used in more than half the abortions across the country.
*  And Julian Barnes goes inside the Biden administration's plan to publicize secret
*  intelligence to ensure that China never enters the war in Ukraine on behalf of Russia.
*  It's Wednesday, March 1st.
*  All eyes are on the state of Texas where a federal district judge's opinion is expected
*  sooner than a case that could impact reproductive rights again.
*  Here, a group of anti-abortion doctors and medical organizations are suing the FDA, challenging
*  the approval of mythoprex, generically known as mythoprystone, part of a two drug regimen
*  commonly used for abortions.
*  The result, if you win, is that abortion access will be significantly limited.
*  Is that the goal of this lawsuit?
*  No, the goal of this lawsuit is to prep American women and girls from dangerous chemical
*  abortion drugs.
*  This is essentially a backdoor national abortion ban.
*  And what I mean by that is this affects states like California, New York, Illinois, Minnesota,
*  Colorado that have taken this.
*  When you allow male-order abortion drugs like the FDA has done, you get these dangerous
*  chemical abortion drugs in the mail without ever seeing an abortion is even in person.
*  No ultrasound, no protections.
*  They're not going to stop until abortion is completely banned in the whole country and
*  being in a blue state is not going to save you.
*  So Pam, tell me about this case.
*  So this is a case that was filed in a federal court in Texas and it was filed by a consortium
*  of anti-abortion groups.
*  And basically, it wants the FDA to be ordered to revoke the approval of the two main
*  drugs that are used for medication abortion in the United States.
*  And remember, medication abortion has become an increasingly common method of abortion.
*  It's now used in more than half of abortions in the United States.
*  And that proportion is almost certainly growing since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.
*  And what's their argument?
*  So they spend a lot of time talking about the first drug that's used in this two drug
*  medication abortion regimen.
*  That's called Mifapristone.
*  And Mifapristone was approved for abortion in 2000, so 23 years ago.
*  And the main argument in this case is they are claiming that it should not have ever been
*  approved for abortion.
*  They say that there were a bunch of procedural errors in the way that the FDA went about
*  approving Mifapristone.
*  They claim that it was initially approved under a regulation that was only supposed to
*  be for illness.
*  And they claimed that pregnancy could not be considered an illness.
*  And they are also claiming that this drug and the other drug, Mizapristone, are unsafe.
*  They say that women who take these drugs end up in the emergency room, hemorrhaging,
*  and with infections, and that it's not safe for the women to be using these drugs.
*  And is any of that true?
*  I mean, as you've said, these drugs have been on the market for over 20 years now.
*  So mainstream credible medical experts would say that there really is no basis to the claims
*  in this lawsuit.
*  These drugs used for medication abortion are really very safe.
*  Many plus years of studies have shown that fewer than 1% of pregnant patients who take
*  these drugs at the appropriate time end up with serious complications.
*  So there can be serious complications like hemorrhaging and infection, but they are very,
*  very rare.
*  And many experts will point out that actually the process of going through a pregnancy has
*  a much greater safety risk for women than taking these abortion medications.
*  So the safety arguments really have no real grounding to them.
*  The procedural arguments also seem to be really without merit.
*  And one of the things that's very interesting, particularly about Mizapristone, is that
*  it was actually approved by the FDA and continues to be regulated by the FDA in a very, very
*  strict way, much more strict than most other drugs.
*  So it's actually somewhat ironic that there are claims that the FDA has been kind of
*  lax here or has ignored evidence about Mizapristone because in fact, it's kept a very, very
*  tightly and on Mizapristone and has carefully monitored it since it's been approved.
*  So this is kind of unheard of, right?
*  What this group is asking.
*  Like that accord would undo an FDA approval process, which is a scientific process that's
*  taken years with many experts.
*  Like what does a federal judge know about science and medicine?
*  Yeah, you know, when this lawsuit was first filed in November, many legal experts thought
*  that it would kind of die quickly and it just seemed like a very fringe kind of claim
*  that had really no legal basis.
*  But it hasn't, you know, we're at the point where we're going to get at least an initial
*  ruling in the case.
*  And if the court were to rule in favor of the anti-abortion groups, it would apparently
*  be the first time that a court has ordered the FDA to revoke a drug against the FDA's
*  will.
*  And it would also have implications for, you know, really any other drug potentially, vaccines
*  or contraception or morning after pills.
*  This is the kind of thing that could set a precedent that could have very widespread
*  implications.
*  So how did this case get to this point?
*  It's very interesting.
*  This sort of umbrella group, this consortium that is suing is called the Alliance for
*  Hippocratic Medicine.
*  Okay.
*  It decided to incorporate a couple months after a Roe v. Wade was overturned and they decided
*  to incorporate in Amarillo, Texas.
*  The groups themselves are not actually based there.
*  In fact, the consortium has a mailing address in Tennessee, but they picked Amarillo and
*  that appears to be either a remarkable coincidence or a savvy legal strategy because only one federal
*  judge covers the Amarillo region.
*  And he is a very conservative Christian.
*  He was appointed by Trump.
*  His name is Matthew Kesmerich.
*  And he has, in the past, worked for a conservative legal group.
*  He has also written prior to his being appointed a judge.
*  He has written articles that included some anti-abortion sentiments.
*  So essentially what you're saying is that the plaintiffs find themselves either by accident
*  or very much on purpose before a judge who's probably pretty sympathetic to their cause.
*  Yes.
*  The plaintiffs do say that they weren't judge-shopping.
*  They say they are located in Amarillo because some of their members live there and they do
*  have one doctor who is also a plaintiff who practices there.
*  But I think a lot of legal experts watching this case feel that they were targeting this
*  jurisdiction because they thought they would find a sympathetic judge.
*  So given that, what's likely to happen?
*  So let's see.
*  It's about one o'clock Eastern time on Tuesday.
*  And I have been repeatedly refreshing my page to try to check and see if the judge has
*  ruled yet.
*  He could rule any day, any minute.
*  And this would be a preliminary ruling which would basically order the FDA to take Mifopristone,
*  this first medication abortion drug off the market.
*  And I think that could be likely just given the political background of this judge.
*  And because it is in a federal court, this would not just apply to Amarillo, Texas or
*  to the state of Texas.
*  It would apply to the entire country.
*  So basically you'd have one federal judge in one city in Texas upending 20 plus years of
*  federal approval of a drug use for abortion.
*  So you think that the exact thing the abortion rights activists are really worried about is
*  actually pretty likely and could happen any minute now.
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's certainly quite possible that that is the way this judge
*  will rule.
*  But it's not at all clear that such a ruling would actually eliminate or even limit access
*  to medication abortion at least not anytime soon.
*  So explain that.
*  Why not?
*  Well, first of all, the FDA and the Department of Justice, which is representing the FDA,
*  they are going to throw everything that they have at this case to try to fight the ruling
*  and try to get it set aside while they're fighting the ruling and try to preserve access
*  to Mifapristone.
*  And then separately, we are already seeing several lawsuits that have been filed in federal
*  courts in blue states that could result in rulings by other federal judges that basically
*  sort of contradict what this Texas judge might say.
*  And so if you end up having a judge in a blue state saying, you know, you need to preserve
*  access to Mifapristone or the FDA is justified in approving Mifapristone, then you're going
*  to have sort of dueling federal judges and that will go up to the Supreme Court and it
*  will have to be resolved there.
*  And then finally, if it turns out that the FDA loses this case, the FDA has enforcement
*  discretion.
*  It can decide, in many cases, that it just doesn't want to enforce or it doesn't have
*  the resources to enforce certain regulations on drugs if it considers those drugs to be
*  safe and effective and it obviously considers this drug to be safe and effective.
*  So in other words, the FDA can just ignore it?
*  Well, I think experts expect that they would seriously explore ways to not have to enforce
*  it.
*  And then there are a couple other things that will also likely kick in, you know, on the
*  ground in the abortion world.
*  One is that, you know, I've said Mifapristone is the first of two drugs that is used in
*  medication abortion.
*  The second one is called Miser Prostle.
*  And there are many providers now that are making plans to use Miser Prostle only for their
*  abortion patients.
*  It is used on its own in many countries, usually where there's not good access to Mifapristone.
*  World Health Organization is fine with it being used on its own.
*  And it may be slightly less effective, but it is still effective and it is also very
*  safe.
*  So many of the providers I've talked to are sort of drafting protocols where this would
*  be the only drug they prescribe.
*  Now the lawsuit is also seeking to go after Miser Prostle, but its case against Miser
*  Prostle is probably even weaker than its case against Mifapristone.
*  And then the other thing is that, you know, remember we've had about half the states now
*  since Roe was overturned, where abortion has either been banned or sharply restricted.
*  And many patients in those states have been ordering these medications from overseas providers
*  in particular one organization called Aid Access, which has them sent from a pharmacy in
*  India.
*  And so I think there's every expectation that now patients who are living in blue states
*  increasingly turn to an organization like that.
*  So even if the judge rules to block Mifapristone, the reality for women trying to access medication
*  abortion is that they're still going to be able to get one, right?
*  One way or another, because the other side, the abortion right side, is pretty prepared
*  for the scenario.
*  That's right, yes.
*  And what about the less likely scenario that the judge rules against this group and
*  doesn't block Mifapristone?
*  What would that say?
*  Yeah, that would be really interesting, because I guess it would be saying to the anti-abortion
*  groups, this is not an avenue that you can pursue.
*  Because if this judge, a judge who is very much inclined to side with them says, no, you
*  can't go this route, you can't overturn the federal government's approval of a medication
*  then it really is kind of the end of the road for that type of strategy.
*  So spaghetti that they threw at the wall that didn't stick?
*  Yeah, I think they will try a different type of pasta.
*  There are creative legal minds on both sides, and the anti-abortion side might have exhausted
*  this strategy, but they certainly will try other strategies.
*  In some way, this strategy will have succeeded a little bit, at least temporarily, because
*  it will have so-and confusion and anxiety.
*  It will just for some people have given the message that getting an abortion is too hard,
*  and they will be deterred.
*  And that's why on the abortion right side, they are working very hard to counter that
*  and idea of chaos and confusion.
*  And basically, these post-Roll abortion wars are going to continue.
*  Pam, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  After the break, Julian Barnes on the Biden Administration's plan to publicize secret
*  intelligence.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Julian, we are going to turn now to a very different topic, which is the war in Ukraine,
*  because the Biden Administration has been experimenting with a really interesting approach
*  toward trying to keep China out of that war.
*  And that's what we wanted to talk to you about.
*  So walk us through that.
*  Michael, as you know, the US doesn't usually talk about its intelligence.
*  These are secrets it tries to keep to itself.
*  Right.
*  But over the last couple of weeks, we've seen a very different playbook in use.
*  New intelligence suggests China may be warming up to the idea of sending artillery and ammunition
*  to Russia's military.
*  The Biden Administration has started talking about some of its intelligence, specifically
*  the intelligence it has about China, and about what China's plans are to help Russia first
*  in meetings with allies and then in statements on TV.
*  The concern that we have now is based on information we have that they're considering providing
*  lethal support.
*  We saw the Secretary's state.
*  And we've made very clear to them that that would cause a serious problem for us and in
*  our relationship.
*  The director of the CIA.
*  Well, we're confident that the Chinese leadership is considering the provision of lethal equipment.
*  And then even the President himself.
*  I had a very frank conversation with President Xi this past summer on this issue.
*  Talking about what they knew.
*  But I don't anticipate a major initiative on the part of China providing weaponry to
*  Russia.
*  In these statements, the US was very clear that China hadn't made this decision.
*  They hadn't started sending any weaponry to Russia, just that they were considering it.
*  The intelligence showed that China was contemplating a shift in their strategy.
*  And the US is trying to influence the decision to make sure China does not make the decision
*  to send lethal aid, to send ammunition to Russia.
*  They don't want China to get involved in this way and they hope that they can stop it.
*  And Julian, what is the precise scenario that the US most fears if China decides to do
*  what the US doesn't want it to do, which is to begin giving arms to Russia.
*  Explain that.
*  So right now the Chinese are on the sidelines.
*  They give diplomatic support to Russia, but they're not providing weaponry.
*  That's in sharp difference to what the US is doing on Ukraine side, right?
*  And US officials believe if China made a shift, if China started doing that, that could
*  really help Russia.
*  That could change the balance of the war because this is a war of artillery.
*  So what the US wants here is that Russia would run out of artillery shells and would
*  have a sort of scarcity that would force them to stop or change their tactics.
*  Right.
*  The US basically doesn't want Russia to have in China what the United States has given
*  Ukraine, which is the backing of a military superpower with a ton of ammunition at its
*  disposal.
*  That's exactly right.
*  And from the Russian point of view, the artillery would be just a start, right?
*  They want Chinese artillery, but what they really want are Chinese advanced missiles,
*  Chinese drones, better technology.
*  And so if they could lure China into this war providing artillery first, maybe next come
*  the drones, next come the guided missiles and all of a sudden both sides have a superpower
*  at their back.
*  Right, which could really change the very nature of this war and potentially tilted in
*  Russia's favor.
*  And that's why it's so important for the US to try to influence this decision to try
*  to persuade China that this is not an its interest, that this is not in the world's
*  interest and that they should not make a deal that would send artillery to Russia.
*  So let's talk about the manner in which the US is trying to do that through this public
*  disclosure of intelligence because I think this is going to remind a lot of our listeners
*  of what the US did before the start of the war in Ukraine when it told the world that
*  it had learned that Russia was preparing to invade Ukraine.
*  And the idea back then was that by publicizing this intelligence over and over and over
*  again, the US could potentially alter Russia's behavior, stop the invasion, right?
*  But it didn't work.
*  Russia still invaded Ukraine.
*  So what's the thinking here among US intelligence officials and the president about why this situation,
*  using pretty much the same strategy, might be different.
*  Why releasing intelligence about China might make it not do something when it didn't work
*  with Russia?
*  Well, the US did hope it could influence Russia, but that was not the main reason they
*  released this intelligence.
*  Most intelligence officials didn't think Vladimir Putin's mind could be changed.
*  But what could be different, what could change was Ukraine could hear the warning.
*  Europe could understand what was at stake and begin to make plans to respond.
*  And all of that worked, right?
*  That did help.
*  China did change the world opinion and the world reacted very quickly when Putin attacked
*  Ukraine.
*  But here, as you said, it's a little bit different.
*  Here they do believe that China is persuadable in a way that Russia was not.
*  Well, explain that.
*  Why would China be persuadable in a way that Russia was not?
*  China is invested in the global order.
*  They care about their reputation worldwide.
*  And economically, they're highly dependent on the United States.
*  They're highly dependent on Europe.
*  They have an economy 100% based on exports, trade.
*  If that was threatened, if that was in jeopardy, so too would be political stability in China.
*  And that's what they care about above all else.
*  God, so what you're suggesting, Julian, is that behind this US approach here to disclosing
*  all this intelligence about what China is thinking of doing is a threat to cut off some
*  level of trade with China, if China decides that it will supply arms to Russia.
*  Is that right?
*  It's not an explicit threat.
*  You have not heard US officials outline exactly what they would do if China was to provide
*  ammunition or weaponry to Russia.
*  But it's very clear to China what the implicit threat is.
*  The US could do to China aversion of what it has done to Russia.
*  It could put on sanctions against individual companies.
*  It could put on export controls that stop the flow of crucial American technology to China
*  that really drive a lot of crucial industries there.
*  All of these things damaged Russia, but they would really damage China because it is such
*  a trade-oriented economy that they do not want to risk being cut off from the US or cut
*  off from Europe.
*  They're most important trading partners.
*  So is there any evidence that this US strategy is working?
*  That putting forth this intelligence about where China is in this decision making process
*  is going to prevent them from sending arms to Russia.
*  There is some evidence that it's working.
*  After the US has said it believed China was considering supplying weapons and ammunition
*  to Russia, China has dismissed the claims.
*  With the forum instructing it was America not China that was quote endlessly shipping
*  weapons to the battlefield.
*  Once the US put out this intelligence, China immediately said it was not true.
*  They're not aimed at third countries, but they would also not be the subject as he put
*  it to interference and provocations from third countries either.
*  China said that it wasn't intending to do this.
*  It was not a party to the war in the same way that the US was a party to the war.
*  China's top diplomat Wang Yi says his country has a peace plan for Ukraine.
*  China also started pushing a peace plan for Ukraine.
*  On Friday, China released a position paper at 12 point document which among other things
*  calls for a resumption of peace talks with China continuing to play a constructive role.
*  Now that peace plan doesn't have any chance of moving forward, but that is the role that
*  the US wants China to have as a superpower that is on the side of negotiations or the
*  side of peace.
*  So the circumstantial evidence that this tactic is working is that in response to this US
*  strategy, China is publicly drawing boundaries around its role in this conflict and emphasizing
*  its neutrality, all of which is music to the years of the United States, given this very
*  specific fear that China might give arms to Russia.
*  Look, no US official is spiking the football right now and saying this worked, the dangers
*  over, we've kept China on the sidelines.
*  No, not at all.
*  We don't know for sure long term what China will do, but early returns are positive, right?
*  Because they have stayed out for now.
*  It definitely feels, Julian, like we're witnessing pretty much the birth of a new kind of US
*  approach to intelligence, right?
*  And that's one where we overshare in order to influence the behavior of our adversaries.
*  First, we try it with Russia now, we're trying it with China.
*  I'm curious why haven't we done this in the past?
*  What has changed since this conflict in Ukraine began that makes the US think that this
*  is the right way to use our intelligence?
*  Michael, there's a whole flood of new information coming out there.
*  There's commercial satellite photos.
*  There is videos posted to social media, just a wealth of new information flooding the
*  zone.
*  And it makes it very hard for adversaries to pick out where the information is coming from.
*  So if you have a spy inside another country or if you have a communications intercept,
*  it is much harder for Russia or any other adversary to figure out where the leak might
*  be, right?
*  Because there's just so much noise.
*  This whole flood is essentially keeping the exquisite sources, the spies, the intercepts
*  hidden.
*  Got it.
*  So because the intelligence sources we most care about are shielded by all this noise,
*  we don't endanger them when we disclose intelligence like what we just did against China.
*  That's right.
*  So it strikes me that for this new approach to work, our intelligence has to be right.
*  And it has to be reliably right because we're putting it out there, telling the world
*  to have confidence in it and hoping that it's going to change the behavior of our adversaries.
*  If it turns out that our intelligence is not correct, then we're going to be embarrassed.
*  Our adversaries are not going to respond the way we want.
*  And we're going to lose credibility on the world stage.
*  So the stakes of this new playbook would seem to be pretty high.
*  The stakes are high.
*  If we rewind 20 years to the Iraq war, we'll all remember how much damage was done to the
*  credibility of the US intelligence agencies by getting that intelligence about that war
*  wrong.
*  Weapons of mass destruction that didn't exist.
*  They didn't exist.
*  And so it's very important for the credibility of the United States, the credibility of its
*  allies that this intelligence be correct.
*  But this explosion of commercial satellites, this explosion of open source intelligence
*  is a bit of a check, right?
*  It is some botracing information that adds to the US credibility.
*  It makes it harder to get things wrong.
*  And that's the big reason the US has become more confident in its intelligence and more
*  willing to release it.
*  And as a result, you will see the US use this playbook of publicizing and declassifying
*  intelligence, not just in the war in Ukraine, but in a whole variety of conflicts and crises
*  around the world.
*  Well, Julian, thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Tuesday night, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot was resoundingly defeated in her bid for
*  reelection, coming in a distant third place and failing to advance into a runoff scheduled
*  for next month.
*  Lightfoot was the first black woman ever elected as mayor of Chicago, the nation's third
*  largest city.
*  But in a race dominated by the issue of crime, Lightfoot struggled to make a case for a
*  second turn.
*  In her tenure, homicide rates have soared to generational highs and there have been
*  spikes in robberies, muggings and card jackings.
