# A Threat to Abortion Pills. Plus, the U.S. Shares Secrets
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbBsgsP1CBY)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverisi.
*  And I'm Michael Wobarbaugh.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, two stories.
*  First, my colleague Pam Bellic on why any day now, a federal judge in Texas could issue
*  an order to ban the pill used in more than half the abortions across the country.
*  And Julian Barnes goes inside the Biden administration's plan to publicize secret intelligence to ensure
*  that China never enters the war in Ukraine on behalf of Russia.
*  It's Wednesday, March 1st.
*  All eyes are on the state of Texas, where a federal district judge's opinion is expected
*  soon in a case that could impact reproductive rights again.
*  Here, a group of anti-abortion doctors and medical organizations are suing the FDA,
*  challenging the approval of Mifiprex, generically known as Mifipristone, part of a two-drug regimen
*  commonly used for abortions.
*  The result, if you win, is that abortion access will be significantly limited.
*  Is that the goal of this lawsuit?
*  No, the goal of this lawsuit is to protect American women and girls from dangerous chemical
*  abortion drugs.
*  This is essentially a backdoor national abortion ban.
*  And what I mean by that is this affects states like California, New York, Illinois, Minnesota,
*  Colorado that have taken steps...
*  When you allow mail order abortion drugs, like the FDA has done, you get these dangerous
*  chemical abortion drugs in the mail without ever seeing an abortionist even in person.
*  No ultrasound, no protections.
*  They're not going to stop until abortion is completely banned in the whole country, and
*  being in a blue state is not going to save you.
*  So Pam, tell me about this case.
*  So this is a case that was filed in a federal court in Texas, and it was filed by a consortium
*  of anti-abortion groups.
*  And basically, it wants the FDA to be ordered to revoke the approval of the two main drugs
*  that are used for medication abortion in the United States.
*  And remember, medication abortion has become an increasingly common method of abortion.
*  It's now used in more than half of abortions in the United States.
*  And that proportion is almost certainly growing since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v.
*  Wade.
*  And what's their argument?
*  So they spend a lot of time talking about the first drug that's used in this two-drug
*  medication abortion regimen, and that's called Mifopristone.
*  And Mifopristone was approved for abortion in 2000, so 23 years ago.
*  And the main argument in this case is they are claiming that it should not have ever
*  been approved for abortion.
*  They say that there were a bunch of procedural errors in the way that the FDA went about
*  approving Mifopristone.
*  They claim that it was initially approved under a regulation that was only supposed
*  to be for illness.
*  And they claim that pregnancy could not be considered an illness.
*  And they're also claiming that this drug and the other drug, Mifopristone, are unsafe.
*  They say that women who take these drugs end up in the emergency room, hemorrhaging and
*  with infections, and that it's not safe for the women to be using these drugs.
*  And is any of that true?
*  I mean, as you've said, you know, these drugs have been on the market for over 20 years now.
*  So mainstream credible medical experts would say that there really is no basis to the claims
*  in this lawsuit.
*  These drugs used for medication abortion are really very safe.
*  20 plus years of studies have shown that fewer than 1% of pregnant patients who take these
*  drugs at the appropriate time end up with serious complications.
*  So you know, there can be serious complications like hemorrhaging and infection, but they
*  are very, very rare.
*  And many experts will point out that actually the process of going through a pregnancy has
*  a much greater safety risk for a woman than taking these abortion medications.
*  So the safety arguments really have no real grounding to them.
*  The procedural arguments also seem to be really without merit.
*  And one of the things that's very interesting, particularly about Mifopristone, is that it
*  was actually approved by the FDA and continues to be regulated by the FDA in a very, very
*  strict way, much more strict than most other drugs.
*  So it's actually somewhat ironic that there are claims that the FDA has been kind of lax
*  here or has ignored evidence about Mifopristone because in fact, it's kept a very, very tight
*  lid on Mifopristone and has carefully monitored it since it's been approved.
*  So this is kind of unheard of, right?
*  What this group is asking, like that a court would undo an FDA approval process, which
*  is a scientific process that's taken years with many experts.
*  Like what does a federal judge know about science and medicine?
*  Yeah, you know, when this lawsuit was first filed in November, many legal experts thought
*  that it would kind of die quickly.
*  And it just seemed like a very fringe kind of claim that had really no legal basis.
*  But it hasn't.
*  We're at the point where we're going to get at least an initial ruling in the case.
*  And if the court were to rule in favor of the anti-abortion groups, it would apparently
*  be the first time that a court has ordered the FDA to revoke a drug against the FDA's
*  will.
*  And it would also have implications for, you know, really any other drug potentially, vaccines
*  or contraception or morning after pills.
*  This is the kind of thing that could set a precedent that could have very widespread
*  implications.
*  So how did this case get to this point?
*  It's very interesting.
*  This sort of umbrella group, this consortium that is suing is called the Alliance for Hippocratic
*  Medicine.
*  It decided to incorporate a couple months after Roe v. Wade was overturned.
*  And they decided to incorporate in Amarillo, Texas.
*  The groups themselves are not actually based there.
*  In fact, the consortium has a mailing address in Tennessee.
*  But they picked Amarillo.
*  And that appears to be either a remarkable coincidence or a savvy legal strategy, because
*  only one federal judge covers the Amarillo region.
*  And he is a very conservative Christian.
*  He was appointed by Trump.
*  His name is Matthew Kazmarek.
*  And he has in the past worked for a conservative legal group.
*  He has also written prior to his being appointed a judge, he has written articles that included
*  some anti-abortion sentiments.
*  So essentially what you're saying is that the plaintiffs find themselves either by accident
*  or very much on purpose before a judge who's probably pretty sympathetic to their cause.
*  Yes.
*  The plaintiffs do say that they weren't judge shopping.
*  They say they are located in Amarillo because some of their members live there.
*  And they do have one doctor who is also a plaintiff who practices there.
*  But I think a lot of legal experts watching this case feel that they were targeting this
*  jurisdiction because they thought they would find a sympathetic judge.
*  So given that, what's likely to happen?
*  So let's see.
*  It's about one o'clock Eastern time on Tuesday.
*  And I have been repeatedly refreshing my page to try to check and see if the judge has ruled
*  yet.
*  He could rule any day, any minute.
*  And this would be a preliminary ruling which would basically order the FDA to take Miffl-Pristone,
*  this first medication abortion drug, off the market.
*  And I think that could be likely just given the political background of this judge.
*  And because it is in a federal court, this would not just apply to Amarillo, Texas or
*  to the state of Texas.
*  It would apply to the entire country.
*  So basically you'd have one federal judge in one city in Texas upending 20 plus years
*  of federal approval of a drug used for abortion.
*  So you think that the exact thing the abortion rights activists are really worried about
*  is actually pretty likely and could happen any minute now?
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's certainly quite possible that that is the way this judge will
*  rule.
*  But it's not at all clear that such a ruling would actually eliminate or even limit access
*  to medication abortion, at least not anytime soon.
*  So explain that.
*  Why not?
*  Well, first of all, the FDA and the Department of Justice, which is representing the FDA,
*  they are going to throw everything that they have at this case to try to fight the ruling
*  and try to get it set aside while they're fighting the ruling and try to preserve access
*  to Miffl-Pristone.
*  And then separately, we are already seeing several lawsuits that have been filed in federal
*  courts in blue states that could result in rulings by other federal judges that basically
*  sort of contradict what this Texas judge might say.
*  And so if you end up having a judge in a blue state saying, you know, you need to preserve
*  access to Miffl-Pristone or the FDA is justified in approving Miffl-Pristone, then you're going
*  to have sort of dueling federal judges and that will go up to the Supreme Court and it
*  will have to be resolved there.
*  And then finally, if it turns out that the FDA loses this case, the FDA has enforcement
*  discretion.
*  It can decide in many cases that it just doesn't want to enforce or it doesn't have the resources
*  to enforce certain regulations on drugs.
*  If it considers those drugs to be safe and effective, and it obviously considers this
*  drug to be safe and effective.
*  So in other words, the FDA can just ignore it?
*  Well, I think experts expect that they would seriously explore ways to not have to enforce
*  it.
*  And then there are a couple other things that will also likely kick in, you know, on the
*  ground in the abortion world.
*  One is that, you know, I've said Miffl-Pristone is the first of two drugs that is used in
*  medication abortion.
*  The second one is called misoprostol.
*  And there are many providers now that are making plans to use misoprostol only for their
*  abortion patients.
*  It is used on its own in many countries, usually where there's not good access to Miffl-Pristone.
*  The World Health Organization is fine with it being used on its own, and it may be slightly
*  less effective, but it is still effective and it is also very safe.
*  So many of the providers I've talked to are sort of drafting protocols where this would
*  be the only drug they prescribe.
*  Now the lawsuit is also seeking to go after misoprostol, but its case against misoprostol
*  is probably even weaker than its case against Miffl-Pristone.
*  And then the other thing is that, you know, remember we've had about half the states
*  now since Roe was overturned where abortion has either been banned or sharply restricted.
*  And many patients in those states have been ordering these medications from overseas providers,
*  in particular one organization called Aid Access, which has them sent from a pharmacy
*  in India.
*  And so I think there's every expectation that now patients who are living in blue states
*  increasingly turn to an organization like that.
*  So even if the judge rules to block Miffl-Pristone, the reality for women trying to access medication
*  abortion is that they're still going to be able to get one, right?
*  One way or another.
*  Because the other side, the abortion rights side, is pretty prepared for this scenario.
*  That's right, yes.
*  And what about the less likely scenario that the judge rules against this group and doesn't
*  block Miffl-Pristone?
*  What would that say?
*  Yeah, that would be really interesting because I guess it would be saying to the anti-abortion
*  groups, this is not an avenue that you can pursue.
*  Because if this judge, a judge who is very much inclined to side with them, says, no,
*  you can't go this route.
*  You can't overturn the federal government's approval of a medication, then it really is
*  kind of the end of the road for that type of strategy.
*  So spaghetti that they threw at the wall that didn't stick.
*  Yeah, I think they will try a different type of pasta.
*  There are creative legal minds on both sides.
*  And the anti-abortion side might have exhausted this strategy, but they certainly will try
*  other strategies.
*  And in some way, this strategy will have succeeded a little bit, at least temporarily, because
*  it will have sown confusion and anxiety.
*  It will just, for some people, have given the message that getting an abortion is too
*  hard and they will be deterred.
*  And that's why on the abortion right side, they are working very hard to counter that
*  idea of chaos and confusion.
*  And basically, these post-war abortion wars are going to continue.
*  Pam, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  After the break, Julian Barnes on the Biden administration's plan to publicize secret
*  intelligence.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Julian, we are going to turn now to a very different topic, which is the war in Ukraine,
*  because the Biden administration has been experimenting with a really interesting approach
*  toward trying to keep China out of that war.
*  And that's what we wanted to talk to you about.
*  So walk us through that.
*  Michael, as you know, the U.S. doesn't usually talk about its intelligence.
*  These are secrets it tries to keep to itself.
*  Right.
*  But over the last couple of weeks, we've seen a very different playbook in use.
*  New intelligence suggests China may be warming up to the idea of sending artillery and ammunition
*  to Russia's military.
*  The Biden administration has started talking about some of its intelligence, specifically
*  the intelligence it has about China and about what China's plans are to help Russia, first
*  in meetings with allies and then in statements on TV.
*  The concern that we have now is based on information we have that they're considering
*  providing lethal support.
*  We saw the secretary of state.
*  And we've made very clear to them that that would cause a serious problem for us and in
*  our relationship.
*  The director of the CIA.
*  Well, we're confident that the Chinese leadership is considering the provision of lethal equipment.
*  And then even the president himself.
*  I had a very frank conversation with President Xi this past summer on this issue.
*  Talking about what they knew.
*  But I don't anticipate a major initiative on the part of China providing weaponry to Russia.
*  In these statements, the U.S. was very clear that China hadn't made this decision.
*  They hadn't started sending any weaponry to Russia, just that they were considering it.
*  The intelligence showed that China was contemplating a shift in their strategy.
*  The U.S. is trying to influence the decision to make sure China does not make the decision
*  to send lethal aid, to send ammunition to Russia.
*  They don't want China to get involved in this way and they hope that they can stop it.
*  And Julian, what is the precise scenario that the U.S. most fears if China decides to do
*  what the U.S. doesn't want it to do, which is to begin giving arms to Russia?
*  Why not?
*  So right now, the Chinese are on the sidelines.
*  They give diplomatic support to Russia, but they're not providing weaponry.
*  That's in sharp difference to what the U.S. is doing on Ukraine's side, right?
*  And U.S. officials believe if China made a shift, if China started doing that, that could
*  really help Russia.
*  That could change the balance of the war because this is a war of artillery.
*  So what the U.S. wants here is that Russia would run out of artillery shells and would
*  have a sort of scarcity that would force them to stop or change their tactics.
*  Right.
*  The U.S. basically doesn't want Russia to have in China what the United States has given
*  Ukraine, which is the backing of a military superpower with a ton of ammunition at its
*  disposal.
*  That's exactly right.
*  And from the Russian point of view, the artillery would be just a start, right?
*  They want Chinese artillery, but what they really want are Chinese advanced missiles,
*  Chinese drones, better technology.
*  And so if they could lure China into this war, providing artillery first, maybe next
*  come the drones, next come the guided missiles, and all of a sudden both sides have a superpower
*  at their back.
*  Right.
*  Which could really change the very nature of this war and potentially tilt it in Russia's
*  favor.
*  And that's why it's so important for the U.S. to try to influence this decision, to
*  try to persuade China that this is not in its interest, that this is not in the world's
*  and that they should not make a deal that would send artillery to Russia.
*  So let's talk about the manner in which the U.S. is trying to do that through this public
*  disclosure of intelligence, because I think this is going to remind a lot of our listeners
*  of what the U.S. did before the start of the war in Ukraine when it told the world that
*  it had learned that Russia was preparing to invade Ukraine.
*  The idea back then was that by publicizing this intelligence over and over and over again,
*  the U.S. could potentially alter Russia's behavior, stop the invasion.
*  But it didn't work.
*  Russia still invaded Ukraine.
*  So what's the thinking here among U.S. intelligence officials and the president about why this
*  situation using pretty much the same strategy might be different?
*  Why releasing intelligence about China might make it not do something?
*  When it didn't work with Russia?
*  Well, the U.S. did hope it could influence Russia, but that was not the main reason they
*  released this intelligence.
*  Most intelligence officials didn't think Vladimir Putin's mind could be changed.
*  But what could be different, what could change was Ukraine could hear the warning.
*  Europe could understand what was at stake and begin to make plans to respond.
*  And all of that worked, right?
*  That did help.
*  That did change the world opinion.
*  And the world reacted very quickly when Putin attacked Ukraine.
*  But here, as you said, it's a little bit different.
*  Here, they do believe that China is persuadable in a way that Russia was not.
*  Well, explain that.
*  Why would China be persuadable in a way that Russia was not?
*  China is invested in the global order.
*  They care about their reputation worldwide.
*  And economically, they're highly dependent on the United States.
*  They're highly dependent on Europe.
*  They have an economy 100% based on exports, trade.
*  If that was threatened, if that was in jeopardy, so too would be political stability in China.
*  And that's what they care about above all else.
*  Got it. So what you're suggesting, Julian, is that behind this US approach here to disclosing
*  all this intelligence about what China is thinking of doing is a threat to cut off some
*  level of trade with China if China decides that it will supply arms to Russia.
*  Is that right?
*  It's not an explicit threat.
*  You have not heard US officials outline exactly what they would do if China was to provide
*  ammunition or weaponry to Russia.
*  But it's very clear to China what the implicit threat is.
*  The US could do to China a version of what it has done to Russia.
*  Right. It could put on sanctions against individual companies.
*  It could put on export controls that stop the flow of crucial American technology to
*  China that really drive a lot of crucial industries there.
*  All of these things damaged Russia, but they would really damage China, right?
*  Because it is such a trade oriented economy that they do not want to risk being cut off
*  from the US or cut off from Europe, their most important trading partners.
*  Understood. So is there any evidence that this US strategy is working, that putting
*  forth this intelligence about where China is in this decision making process is going
*  to prevent them from sending arms to Russia?
*  There is some evidence that it's working.
*  After the US has said it believed China was considering supplying weapons and ammunition
*  to Russia, China has dismissed the claims with the foreign ministry saying it was America,
*  not China, that was, quote, endlessly shipping weapons to the battlefield.
*  Once the US put out this intelligence, China immediately said it was not true.
*  That they're not aimed at third countries, but they would also not be the subject, as
*  he put it, to interference and provocations from third countries either.
*  China said that it wasn't intending to do this. It was not a party to the war in the
*  same way that the US was a party to the war.
*  China's top diplomat Wang Yi says his country has a peace plan for Ukraine.
*  China also started pushing a peace plan for Ukraine.
*  On Friday, China released a position paper, a 12 point document, which among other things,
*  calls for a resumption of peace talks with China continuing to play a constructive role.
*  Now, that peace plan doesn't have any chance of moving forward, but that is the role that
*  the US wants China to have as a superpower that is on the side of negotiations or the side of peace.
*  The circumstantial evidence that this tactic is working is that in response to this US strategy,
*  China is publicly drawing boundaries around its role in this conflict and emphasizing
*  its neutrality, all of which is music to the ears of the United States, given this very specific fear
*  that China might give arms to Russia.
*  Look, no US official is spiking the football right now and saying,
*  this worked, the danger's over, we've kept China on the sidelines.
*  No, not at all. We don't know for sure long term what China will do.
*  But early returns are positive, right? Because they have stayed out for now.
*  It definitely feels, Julian, like we're witnessing pretty much the birth of a new
*  kind of US approach to intelligence, right? And that's one where we overshare in order
*  to influence the behavior of our adversaries. First, we tried it with Russia. Now we're
*  trying it with China. I'm curious, why haven't we done this in the past? What has changed
*  since this conflict in Ukraine began that makes the US think that this is the right way to use
*  our intelligence? Michael, there's a whole flood of new information coming out there. There's
*  commercial satellite photos. There is videos posted to social media, just a wealth of new
*  information flooding the zone. And it makes it very hard for adversaries to pick out
*  where the information is coming from. So if you have a spy inside another country,
*  or if you have a communications intercept, it is much harder for Russia or any other adversary to
*  figure out where the leak might be, right? Because there's just so much noise. This whole
*  flood is essentially keeping the exquisite sources, the spies, the intercepts hidden.
*  Got it. So because the intelligence sources we most care about are shielded by all this noise,
*  we don't endanger them when we disclose intelligence like what we just did against China.
*  That's right. So it strikes me that for this new approach to work, our intelligence has to be
*  right. And it has to be reliably right, because we're putting it out there, telling the world to
*  have confidence in it and hoping that it's going to change the behavior of our adversaries. If it
*  turns out that our intelligence is not correct, then we're going to be embarrassed. Our adversaries
*  are not going to respond the way we want, and we're going to lose credibility on the world stage.
*  So the stakes of this new playbook would seem to be pretty high. The stakes are high. If we rewind
*  20 years to the Iraq War, we'll all remember how much damage was done to the credibility of the
*  U.S. intelligence agencies by getting that intelligence about that war wrong. Right. Weapons
*  of mass destruction that didn't exist. They didn't exist. And so it's very important for
*  the credibility of the United States, the credibility of its allies, that this intelligence be correct.
*  But this explosion of commercial satellites, this explosion of open source intelligence,
*  is a bit of a check, right? It is some buttressing information that adds to the U.S. credibility.
*  It makes it harder to get things wrong. And that's a big reason the U.S. has become more
*  confident in its intelligence and more willing to release it. And as a result, you will see the U.S.
*  use this playbook of publicizing and declassifying intelligence, not just in the war in Ukraine,
*  but in a whole variety of conflicts and crises around the world.
*  Well, Julian, thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. On Tuesday night, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot
*  was resoundingly defeated in her bid for reelection, coming in a distant third place
*  and failing to advance into a runoff scheduled for next month. Lightfoot was the first Black woman
*  ever elected as mayor of Chicago, the nation's third largest city. But in a race dominated by
*  the issue of crime, Lightfoot struggled to make a case for a second term. During her tenure,
*  homicide rates have soared to generational highs, and there have been spikes in robberies,
*  muggings and carjackings.
