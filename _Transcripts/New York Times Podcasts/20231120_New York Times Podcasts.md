# The New Speaker Avoided a Shutdown. Can He Avoid Being Ousted?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oizRhOAtdKA)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today.
*  By working with Democrats to avert a government shutdown at the end of last week, the new
*  Republican House Speaker, Mike Johnson, seemed to put himself on the same path of self-immolation
*  that doomed his predecessor.
*  Or did he?
*  My colleague Katie Edmondson on why this time things could be different.
*  It's Monday, November 20th.
*  So Katie, the US government did not shut down over the past few days as many had feared
*  that it might or would, especially given the dysfunction we have observed and talked to
*  you about endlessly from this Republican controlled House over the past year.
*  That's right.
*  Congress was staring down this deadline at midnight last Friday.
*  Government funding was set to expire unless Congress came to some sort of deal to keep
*  the government funded.
*  There were a lot of questions as to whether Congress would be able to make that happen.
*  They were working on a very short time frame in large part because House Republicans really
*  wasted three weeks trying to elect a new speaker.
*  And then there were a lot of questions about what that new speaker, Speaker Mike Johnson,
*  would do once he got the job to try to avert a shutdown.
*  Right.
*  And the fact that there wasn't a shutdown was very much the work of this new House Speaker.
*  So in brief, what did we learn about Speaker Mike Johnson from the fact that there wasn't
*  a shutdown?
*  I think the first thing that we learned is that Mike Johnson as speaker operates differently
*  at least so far than Mike Johnson, the rank and file member, did.
*  So if you remember back in September, Kevin McCarthy, really the last major thing he did
*  as speaker was to pass this deal to keep the government funded through this November deadline.
*  And he used Democratic votes to do that.
*  And that was a deal that Mike Johnson opposed.
*  He voted against keeping the government open back in September.
*  Fast forward to November.
*  Now he's speaker.
*  He chose in this case to rise above his own hard right ideology and to instead make the
*  decision to keep the government open and to use Democrats, in fact, to do that.
*  And I think the second thing that we learned is that in doing so, he has invoked the ire
*  of the Freedom Caucus in such a way that puts him on potentially a similar collision course
*  to what former speaker Kevin McCarthy found himself on at the very beginning of his job
*  with those hard right Republicans.
*  Because even though Mike Johnson really was considered one of the Freedom Caucuses own,
*  The Freedom Caucus obviously was very unhappy to see Mike Johnson pass this short term spending
*  bill with Democratic votes.
*  Okay.
*  So tell us the story of what happened during this almost government shutdown that was averted
*  that helps really explain these two learnings that you just laid out.
*  Well, when Mike Johnson is elected speaker, he automatically inherits all of the spending
*  drama that eventually led to the ouster of Kevin McCarthy.
*  And so the first question really was, how is this completely untested speaker going
*  to handle this?
*  And the first move that we saw Speaker Mike Johnson make was if you remember the Israel
*  funding bill that he put on the House floor.
*  And that was a really partisan measure.
*  He didn't advance legislation just to send aid to Israel.
*  He structured it in a way that said, well, in order to send this money, we're going to
*  cut a bunch of money that the Biden administration wanted for the IRS.
*  Right.
*  A clear signal that his approach to this job as speaker right off the bat was very partisan,
*  very much about like sticking it to the Democrats.
*  That was the first message that he sent.
*  And so the first indication was, well, maybe this is someone who is on every important
*  move going to nod to the hard right flank of the party that he came from.
*  OK, so that's the impression we have of Johnson heading into this extremely high stakes question
*  of will the government shut down?
*  So how does he approach it?
*  What happens?
*  Well, so he actually pulls a page from Kevin McCarthy's playbook, and that is by taking
*  a lot of meetings with the various factions of the House Republican Conference.
*  So he heard a lot of varying opinions.
*  There were some Republicans within the House Freedom Caucus who said, let's have the shutdown.
*  Let's force this discussion about how we have to cut spending.
*  And if that requires us to just shut the whole place down, so be it.
*  Chip Roy said, I'll eat my Thanksgiving dinner on the floor of the House and have this discussion.
*  Right.
*  This is the group of Republicans who are basically saying McCarthy didn't have the courage to
*  do what needed to be done.
*  So brand new Speaker Johnson, you should do what he wouldn't shut it down, take a stand,
*  cut government spending at any cost, which would, we should note, be in line with how
*  Mike Johnson acted for years.
*  Yes, that's exactly right.
*  And some of them were saying, well, let's pass a bill that has deep cuts in it.
*  And when the Senate refuses to take it up, as we know they will, because Democrats don't
*  want to support those types of deep spending cuts, right, then let's blame them for the
*  shutdown.
*  Now, of course, he hears an entirely different message from the moderates who tell him, of
*  course, we cannot have a shutdown, especially right before Thanksgiving.
*  It's going to look terrible if we just spent three weeks fighting among ourselves, unable
*  to elect a speaker.
*  And the next thing we do is shut down the government.
*  And then there's a final group of players that he's talking with, and that's over in
*  the Senate.
*  And he checks in with Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader over in the Senate.
*  And Chuck Schumer tells him, in order for any sort of funding mechanism to be signed
*  into law, it has to be bipartisan.
*  You have to work with us because that is the reality of this government.
*  Let's keep government open and we'll work with you.
*  So after hearing from all these various factions, what do we know about what Johnson is thinking
*  at this particular juncture?
*  Well, we really didn't know that much about how he was thinking about this.
*  And we would talk to the lawmakers after these meetings and they would say, you know,
*  he listened to us a lot, but even we don't really have a sense exactly of what he might
*  be planning to do.
*  And so as we kept getting closer and closer to the deadline and we weren't receiving any
*  sorts of leaks or sort of glimmers of how he might approach this, there was really a
*  sense of suspense building, I think for everyone, because we kept getting closer to this deadline
*  and did not have really any visibility on how he might try to get out of it.
*  OK, so when do you finally get a leak or a glimmer?
*  Well, in classic congressional fashion, Speaker Johnson holds a conference call with his members
*  where he tells them the bill that he is going to put on the House floor to keep the government
*  funded is not going to have any spending cuts.
*  It will not be conditioned on any conservative policies being passed into law.
*  So what he unveils to his conference is essentially just a bill that is going to keep government
*  funding flowing into early next year.
*  Now, he did throw a bone, essentially a very small bone to the House Freedom Caucus with
*  and that the way he structures this bill funds the government essentially in two steps.
*  And so in order to keep the government funded again in early 2024, lawmakers will have to
*  take one vote to fund some parts of the government in late January, and then they'll have to
*  take a second vote to fund the rest of it a couple of weeks later in February.
*  And the reason why he structured it this way is that the House Freedom Caucus for years
*  really has complained about the idea that they've had to vote to fund the government
*  in one up or down vote.
*  And so this breaks that in two that takes away that grievance.
*  But at the end of the day, this is still a clean spending bill that he's advancing.
*  Which is very hard for them to accept.
*  It is pretty much a replica of what Kevin McCarthy put on the floor back in September
*  that angered the Freedom Caucus so much that they moved to oust him.
*  Okay, so what happens when Johnson does this?
*  Well, I mean, the conference call was still continuing when one influential conservative
*  Chip Roy of Texas took to Twitter to say that he would oppose the plan.
*  You know, normally people wait at least until the conference call is over to announce their
*  position. But I think that gives you a sense of how angry people were.
*  And I think honestly, some of the Freedom Caucus members were really surprised that
*  Mike Johnson took this tack because again, in their mind, he's one of them.
*  And so I think they were expecting to see something that hewed closer to what they wanted
*  to do.
*  So then the question becomes, is this something that Democrats will support?
*  Because clearly the number of Republican defections to this plan are stacking up in such large
*  numbers that we know Democrats are going to be required to pass this on the House floor.
*  And so we initially hear some grumbling from Democrats on this, and some of it is
*  showmanship. But a lot of it also, frankly, is substantive.
*  And they are really frustrated by the two funding deadlines that this bill lays out.
*  But at the end of the day, we hear some Democrats saying the quiet part out loud, which is
*  this is great for us because there's no spending cuts and there's no conservative policies
*  attached to this. This is exactly what we wanted.
*  The House will be in order.
*  And so members will record their votes by electronic device.
*  This is a five minute vote.
*  When the vote is all said and done with early last week.
*  On this vote, the yeas are three thirty six.
*  The nays are ninety five.
*  We see that a large number of Republicans have opposed this plan, more than 90.
*  Wow.
*  And in fact, every single Democrat, except two, supported it.
*  Two thirds being in the affirmative, the rules are suspended.
*  The bill is passed.
*  And without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid on the table.
*  Which means Democrats put this Republican spending bill over the edge and Johnson had
*  been kind of transformed into someone capable of bipartisanship on a very meaningful scale.
*  That's right. He chose the McCarthy route and using Democrats to supply the bulk of
*  votes to keep the government open.
*  I want to yield it to our speaker, Mike Johnson.
*  Thank you, Steve. I want to thank this extraordinary leadership team.
*  They're doing a great job.
*  And I mean, this is something that he is sensitive to or aware of, at least.
*  And we see that manifest in a news conference that he has on Capitol Hill shortly after
*  the vote. Fox.
*  Thank you. Good morning. My question is, how hard itself has this been for your members?
*  Because they said this is essentially the same thing that bounced Kevin McCarthy.
*  A reporter says to him, look, you know, the arch conservatives are really unhappy with
*  this decision that you've made.
*  And Secret Johnson actually kind of interrupts him and says, Chad, I'm one of the arch
*  conservatives. OK, and I want to cut spending right now.
*  And I would like to put policy writers on this.
*  But when you have a three vote majority, as we do right now, we don't have the votes to
*  be able to advance that right now.
*  So what we need to do is it's just that the math didn't work here.
*  This is the only way for me to keep the government open and funded.
*  I've been at the job less than three weeks.
*  Right. I can't change.
*  I can't turn an aircraft carrier overnight.
*  But this was a very important first step to get us to the next stage.
*  But for those arch conservatives, that's not really a satisfying answer.
*  And so the question for them becomes, can they believe Speaker Johnson when he says
*  to them, look, I'm still one of you guys?
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Katie, if you are a student of this Republican controlled House and this moment in
*  American politics, the logical repercussions of what Speaker Johnson did in working with
*  Democrats to avoid a government shutdown is that some far right House member walks out
*  onto the floor, hits the ejection button and begins a process of basically ending
*  Johnson's speakership.
*  So does it look in the hours and days after this shutdown is averted like Speaker
*  Johnson's going to suffer that fate?
*  Well, we saw Freedom Caucus members come off the floor and reporters were rushing
*  after them saying, well, you know, are you going to do it again?
*  Are you going to move to vacate him for this?
*  And we heard a lot more sympathy for Mike Johnson from these ultra conservative members
*  than we ever heard them give to Kevin McCarthy.
*  In fact, Matt Gaetz, who obviously was the lawmaker who successfully moved to oust Kevin
*  McCarthy, he says, well, you know, everyone gets one mulligan.
*  We also hear from a number of Freedom Caucus members that they are unhappy with this
*  decision, but they don't really begrudge Speaker Johnson personally.
*  If you characterize it as a football game at the end of overtime, down three touchdowns,
*  right? That's when Johnson came in and you're trying to say, do you hold this quarterback
*  to the same standard as the quarterback that got us to that point?
*  No, we do not.
*  Because after all, he's only been on the job for three weeks.
*  It's like throwing in a quarterback in the fourth quarter and expect them to make up
*  for three quarters of failure and you're behind 35-0.
*  So they're going to try to afford him a little bit more grace.
*  But why? I mean, if he did the exact same thing, you might imagine them feeling that
*  the betrayal is even deeper.
*  I mean, I just think it comes down to at the end of the day, they never really trusted
*  Kevin McCarthy.
*  Was it worth, though, toppling McCarthy, given you the same policy?
*  The same policy.
*  Worth it every day and twice on Sunday.
*  At least he doesn't lie to us.
*  And they see Mike Johnson as someone who generally they have been able to trust.
*  They generally see him as one of them.
*  But there also are some lawmakers who are really angry.
*  We're too cowardly to stand up and do our job.
*  Oh, no, a shutdown.
*  Are you frigging kidding me?
*  Representative Chip Roy of Texas again, who is the first Republican member to come out
*  against this plan, who couldn't even wait for the conference call to be done to contain
*  his rage, says that for him, Mike Johnson putting this plan on the floor amounts to
*  strike one and strike two.
*  Hmm. We went through an entire month of drama about a speaker and we just did the same
*  damn thing we've been doing.
*  And we hear some Republicans who just say, look, we can't go on this way.
*  We cannot allow anyone, whether it's our friend Mike Johnson or someone else, to
*  continue business as usual.
*  And do they start to in any way act on their anger at all?
*  We see them begin to act on their anger the very next day.
*  Hmm. So part of the idea of advancing this short term spending bill is to give
*  Republicans in the House more time to pass their individual spending bills.
*  This was a big priority of the House Republican Conference.
*  Right. Let's not have the one up or down vote to fund the government.
*  Let's do it the old school way.
*  And we are going to vote individually on 12 spending bills to fund all the government
*  agencies. Right.
*  The kind of fantasy of Republicans doing it the old school way, actually passing
*  appropriations bill, getting a budget done so that the U.S.
*  government doesn't lurch from shutdown crisis to shutdown crisis.
*  Yeah, that's exactly right.
*  And so the day after Mike Johnson passes this stopgap spending bill to avert the
*  shutdown, he says, all right, you know, let's get back to what we said we were
*  going to do. Let's try to advance one of these spending bills that funds the
*  Justice Department, the Commerce Department, for example.
*  And what we see the House Freedom Caucus do is essentially tank the House's
*  ability to pass that bill.
*  In a block, they all vote against this procedural step to allow a vote on the
*  bill. And it brings the House to a crashing halt.
*  And this is a move that is really meant to be a very clear rebuke of Speaker
*  Johnson. So they're voting against a spending bill that they themselves
*  describe as a crucial priority in their efforts to make government function much
*  better than it has and that embodies conservative values.
*  And they're basically just doing that to show Speaker Johnson how pissed off they
*  are. That's right.
*  And if you want to get super technical about it, they're not even voting against
*  the bill. They're voting against letting the House consider the bill.
*  And that's important just because in previous years that was considered sort of
*  a third rail. It was just something that lawmakers didn't do.
*  But this has become actually a sort of tried and true method of bedeviling the
*  House Speaker for the Freedom Caucus.
*  And we know that because it is a playbook that they used on former speaker Kevin
*  McCarthy when they were upset with him for putting bills on the House floor and
*  passing them with Democratic votes.
*  Right. So if you're Speaker Johnson and you're seeing this tactic of torment used
*  against McCarthy, used against you, you have to start thinking to yourself,
*  there's literally a ticking clock now potentially on my speakership.
*  It is a pretty vivid example of deja vu.
*  And we saw Speaker Johnson, who normally is pretty placid, we saw him kind of storm
*  off the House floor after that happened.
*  And on his heels, in fact, were members of the House Freedom Caucus who came out to
*  Statuary Hall to tell us reporters, you know, we just put the speaker on notice.
*  Hmm. So, Katie, that's where things were when the House went into recess for the
*  Thanksgiving holiday.
*  Johnson on thin ice with the far right and the far right having basically said to
*  Johnson, you are in our sights, be extremely careful.
*  So I want to start to project forward just a little bit because the bill at the center
*  of this drama we've been talking about only funds the government for a couple of
*  months through January and February.
*  And then, of course, Speaker Johnson is right back in the same position.
*  And if he does what he just did in the new year, I have to think that that is strike
*  three for him.
*  And then his speakership could very much be over.
*  Yes, we are essentially going to have to come back to the same place in January and
*  then again in February.
*  And I think the reality is every time Speaker Johnson faces a new government funding
*  deadline, it gets worse for him because now he has these rising expectations to
*  manage. He has the Freedom Caucus getting increasingly upset with him.
*  And in an attempt to assuage the Freedom Caucus, he said to them prior to passing
*  this bill, look, I'll never do this again.
*  I will not put a short term spending bill on the floor again.
*  Hmm. But that's a really hard promise to keep because either you keep the promise,
*  you refuse to put a stopgap spending bill on the House floor, and that potentially
*  puts you down the road of shutting the government down, if not fully, at least
*  partially shutting the government down.
*  But if he decides to try to keep the government open by advancing again a short term
*  spending bill and using Democrats to pass that, then he's just broken a promise to
*  the House Freedom Caucus.
*  And we've seen how they react when speakers break their promises.
*  Right.
*  Now, on the other hand, I do think that we need to think about the possibility that
*  maybe just maybe going forward, the Freedom Caucus cuts him a little more of a break
*  than they cut Kevin McCarthy.
*  And I think a big part of this was that a lot of the antipathy the Freedom Caucus
*  had toward Kevin McCarthy, it was substantive, it was about the policies that he was
*  putting forward, but it was also really personal.
*  That just doesn't exist in the same way for Mike Johnson.
*  And so I think that really injects an unknown variable into the calculus of what
*  happens as Mike Johnson goes down this road of trying to keep the government open at
*  the same time he's trying to keep the Freedom Caucus happy, simply because
*  sometimes the calculation can change when you believe that the guy who's in charge
*  is one of you.
*  So what you're evoking, which is very fascinating and very theoretical, is a
*  world in which far-right House Republicans tolerate Speaker Johnson
*  repeatedly, in a sense, selling them out on budgets.
*  And if that happens and they don't oust him, then that will mean that Johnson has
*  done something pretty remarkable.
*  He's not just risen above his own political instincts in his transition from
*  member to Speaker, but he's somehow convinced these other far-right Republicans
*  to, in a sense, do the same.
*  Well, I think there's a school of thought out there, which is that some of the
*  demands, or rather many of the demands of the Freedom Caucus, are simply impossible
*  right now, given the fact that there's a Democrat in the White House and that
*  Democrats control the Senate, that maybe it's going to take one of their own
*  becoming Speaker for them to finally realize we just can't have these things
*  happen.
*  But I also think there's another variable at play here, which is that we just saw
*  what happens when the Freedom Caucus decides to oust the Speaker.
*  That was a terrible three weeks that we all went through.
*  The House floor was paralyzed.
*  It was chaos.
*  And Republicans were getting terrible headlines week after week because of it.
*  I don't know that anyone, even those in the Freedom Caucus, are particularly eager
*  to return to that status again.
*  And so while in the interim, they've made clear that they're going to try to make
*  his life harder, that they're going to try to punish him in all these small ways.
*  I do think there's a possibility where at the end of the day, if Johnson is able to
*  keep the job, it's not necessarily going to be because the Freedom Caucus is so
*  thrilled with how he's doing.
*  It would be because they essentially can't bear dethroning another Speaker.
*  Well, Katie, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thanks, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Sunday, a senior U.S.
*  official said that Israel and Hamas were extremely close to a deal that would release a large
*  group of hostages being held in Gaza and would institute a days long pause in fighting.
*  What I can say about this at this time is we think that we are closer than we have been
*  perhaps at any point since these negotiations began weeks ago.
*  That there are areas of difference and disagreement that have been narrowed, if not
*  closed out entirely, but that the mantra that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed
*  certainly applies here to such a sensitive negotiation.
*  But as the war raged on, a U.N.
*  official said that two schools run by the agency in northern Gaza that were serving
*  as shelters had been badly damaged by airstrikes and video from one of the schools was being
*  verified by the Times showed many bloodied and motionless bodies at one of the schools.
*  Hamas officials blamed Israel for the attack.
*  Israel, meanwhile, said it was reviewing the situation.
*  On Sunday, John Feiner, a U.S.
*  national security official, was asked about the schools by CNN.
*  What I can say at this point, and we're also in touch with the Israelis to try to
*  find out what they know about what happened, is that if harm was done to innocent civilians
*  sheltering at a U.N.
*  site, that would be totally unacceptable.
*  And in a dramatic and surprise shakeup, the board of OpenAI, the company behind the influential
*  artificial intelligence software, ChatGPT, ousted the firm's CEO, Sam Altman, who has
*  become the public face of the technology.
*  But that decision, made on Friday, led to outrage from Altman supporters inside OpenAI
*  and from outside investors, including Microsoft.
*  As a result, OpenAI's board quickly began talks to bring Altman back as CEO,
*  an offer that Altman was still weighing as of Sunday.
