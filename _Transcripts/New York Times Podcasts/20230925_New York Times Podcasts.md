# An Unexpected Battle Over Banning Caste Discrimination
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDTbJNZZLSM)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro.
*  This is a daily.
*  Today.
*  California is about to become the first state in the country to outlaw discrimination based
*  on a person's caste.
*  My colleague Amy Chin, on why so many now believe a prejudice that originated on the
*  other side of the globe now requires legal protection in the U.S.
*  And why so many are equally convinced that it's a bad idea that will backfire.
*  It's Monday, September 25th.
*  Amy, I wonder if you can tell us about this piece of legislation, which was recently passed
*  by California's democratically controlled legislature and now sits on the desk of its
*  Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom.
*  So the bill is called Senate Bill 403 or SB 403 for short.
*  And essentially it will make caste discrimination illegal in California.
*  And that means everywhere from housing to employment, discrimination based on caste
*  will not be allowed.
*  It will become a protected characteristic, just like sex, gender, sexual orientation.
*  People will not be able to discriminate on that basis.
*  So just define this word caste.
*  I think we all have a little bit of a sense of what it means, but would benefit from hearing you explain it.
*  So the caste system is one of the oldest systems of social stratification.
*  And it began in India thousands of years ago.
*  It has its roots in Hinduism and essentially it's a rigid social hierarchy that people are born into.
*  And the system really govern everything about people's lives, from who they married to the job that they did.
*  And at a very basic level, you have at the top of this hierarchy, the Brahmins, who historically were priests.
*  They had access to education and were considered the purist.
*  Then you have the warrior caste, the merchant caste, the laborer caste.
*  And at the very bottom you had what were known as the quote unquote untouchables, who prefer to call themselves dullets.
*  And they were considered to be so impure that they were outcasts and they were relegated to doing jobs that were also seen as
*  impure, like street sweeping or toilet cleaning.
*  And they couldn't even drink from the same well water as other castes.
*  Over time, the system spread throughout South Asia and spread to other religious communities like to Christians and Sikhs.
*  And the caste hierarchy was also reinforced under British colonial rule.
*  And then in the mid 20th century, caste discrimination was outlawed in countries like India and Nepal.
*  But of course, we know that just because you ban something on paper doesn't mean it actually is gone in practice.
*  And so caste is still a very strong marker of identity in many places.
*  And you can see it in the privileges that people have in their social circles and the kinds of opportunities that they have access to.
*  And this is really still present across South Asia.
*  Much in the way I imagine that when racial prejudice in the US is outlawed, it nevertheless keeps happening.
*  Just because it's banned them a lot doesn't mean it doesn't persist.
*  Right. And some people have drawn that parallel.
*  The journalist Isabel Wilkerson wrote a bestselling book called Caste, in which she compared the caste system in India to the way that race operates in America.
*  The idea that you can be born into a certain hierarchy and that it can be extremely difficult to escape your circumstances.
*  So the fact, Amy, that there's a bill in California about caste discrimination now suggests that lawmakers there believe that this is
*  not just something that remains a problem overseas in South Asia, but it has somehow been imported into the United States.
*  That's right. They've been hearing from their constituents in California that this is becoming a bigger and bigger problem in the diaspora.
*  And that in order to protect residents of California, they need to have a bill specifically focusing on caste discrimination in order to prevent this type of discrimination from happening in the future.
*  But why right now?
*  I mean, you just referred to a diaspora.
*  People from South Asia have been coming to California for generations.
*  Why this moment for this bill to resolve this problem?
*  So it really has to do with patterns of immigration.
*  After a big immigration act in 1965 was passed in the United States, we saw a huge migration of people from Asia, including India, to the United States.
*  And a lot of those people that came over were people who were skilled workers.
*  They had degrees and were able to get jobs in the tech industry and the medical industry in the United States.
*  And a lot of these people in India who were able to have the resources to get these types of degrees work from the upper caste.
*  And so for a long time, caste discrimination didn't really exist, or at least people didn't think it really existed because everyone was from the same caste.
*  But that's changed over time as the composition of the people who are coming from India has also changed.
*  In large part, that has to do with certain changes that are happening in India itself.
*  The country has put in place a system of essentially affirmative action where there are quotas now for people from lower castes to go to universities, to occupy government positions.
*  And we are now starting to see the effects of those affirmative action policies where you had a lot of people who were from lower caste going to these universities and now they suddenly have the degrees to get those skilled worker visas to come to the US.
*  And so the people who are coming over from India to the United States are actually much more diverse.
*  And in California, we've really seen that shift happen because a lot of these people are coming to work in IT jobs, specifically in Silicon Valley, which is why we're seeing so much of this issue being debated in California now.
*  Hmm.
*  So suddenly a much more diverse group of South Asians are in a place like California, and I'm going to guess that that creates a greater opportunity for potential conflict once they arrive.
*  Right.
*  And the caste issue really burst into public consciousness in 2020 when California brought a lawsuit against Cisco, which is a pretty well known tech company.
*  And in the lawsuit, an employee who is from a Dalit background accused two of his bosses who are from upper caste backgrounds of discriminating against him in his job on the basis of caste.
*  He said that they had given him less pay, that they had denied certain opportunities to him in the workplace, and the state on his behalf was suing Cisco.
*  And this really led to a huge conversation in California, I think, in a way that we hadn't seen before.
*  And this was taking place at around the same time as the death of George Floyd had sparked the Black Lives Matter movement.
*  And suddenly people were able to describe their experiences with caste discrimination using vocabulary that was understandable to people who understood it in the context of race.
*  Terms like systemic discrimination and oppressed communities.
*  These were all concepts that now the public was much more familiar with.
*  Fascinating.
*  So the conversation going on in the US in the wake of George Floyd's death, this wrenching conversation about race oppression, systemic racism, that is giving people from South Asia a framework for thinking about the discrimination that they believe they are experiencing here in the US that's been imported from South Asia.
*  That's right.
*  And it's around this time that people started to feel more comfortable talking about their experiences with caste discrimination.
*  I mean, we heard stories about people experiencing wage theft at the hands of their upper caste bosses.
*  There were people talking about social exclusion, that they weren't being allowed to eat from the same cups and plates as Brahmin employers.
*  I spoke with one doctor in California who said that when other doctors in her city had found out that she was from a lower caste, they stopped referring patients to her practice.
*  And one person that I spoke to really stood out to me.
*  His name was Bim Narayan Biswakarma.
*  Hello.
*  Hi, Ben.
*  How are you?
*  He's 44.
*  He works at a convenience store in El Cerrito, California.
*  And he's from Nepal originally.
*  And he told me that he had experienced caste-based discrimination growing up in Nepal.
*  While growing as a child, I was not that much respected, especially when it comes to, you know, entering a friend's houses.
*  When he would hang out with his friends, his friends' parents would let him go into their homes because he was from a lower caste.
*  And I used to feel like, oh, I felt like insulted, discriminated.
*  So, of course, one of the reasons to come to the US is caste-based discrimination.
*  And he eventually moved to California.
*  He got a job.
*  And at one point, a few years ago, he was looking for a room in a shared house and he found a great one.
*  And on August 18, 2021, I visited the house.
*  He spoke with the landlord, who was also from Nepal.
*  The landlord swore his contentment to welcome me as a tenant.
*  The landlord was really excited for him to move in as a single guy.
*  So presumably, he would be, you know, quiet and not too much of a disturbance.
*  Everything was finalized.
*  The landlord requested me a deposit to his account.
*  So he gives the landlord his deposit and everything seemed like it was fine.
*  But then six hours later, he gets a call from the landlord and the landlord says, sorry, I can't rent this room to you anymore.
*  And that was talking to me as I had a smooth and pleasant conversation with him and everything was finalized that day.
*  Then I asked him what happened and why he flipped over his words.
*  Beam said he was asking questions, you know, why?
*  And the landlord was giving all kinds of reasons.
*  He said he needs a room for family members who visit.
*  And Beam was just very confused.
*  And then all of a sudden...
*  I suddenly remembered the scene where we exchanged our numbers and I saying my name.
*  He remembers that when he had given the deposit to the landlord, he had given him his full name.
*  And his last name is Bishwa Karma, which in Nepal is associated with a lower caste.
*  And then Beam started to confront his landlord.
*  I told him that I know why you are denying.
*  I know the reason why you are denying the room to me.
*  But even before Beam himself said the word caste...
*  The landlord said, oh, no, no, it's not because of your caste, even though Beam hadn't mentioned caste at all.
*  That kind of tell.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  To Beam, it became obvious that actually it was because of his caste.
*  I was kind of, oh, my goodness, I thought I left it back in Nepal.
*  But again, it came to the US.
*  Again, it's happening with the people.
*  I felt like, you know, I was like, shattered.
*  That incident shattered my self-dignity, self-respect.
*  I felt like humiliated.
*  So definitely that incident had hurt me from within, actually.
*  He said he just was in such shock because he had never expected to experience any of this kind of caste-based
*  discrimination in the United States.
*  I mean, it's one of the reasons why he left Nepal.
*  Right. So suddenly he's finding that this vestige of his former life that he was very happy to leave behind has
*  actually followed him to California and veered its head in a pretty ugly way, according to him.
*  That's right.
*  So what's the response to this growing awareness of caste discrimination as people like Beam are telling the stories
*  he told you?
*  So people start to say that there need to be more protections made explicit for people who are
*  experiencing caste-based discrimination.
*  So we start to see universities incorporate caste-based discrimination into their
*  anti-discrimination statutes.
*  Companies follow suit.
*  Earlier this year, we saw Seattle become the first US city to ban caste-based discrimination.
*  And then in February this year, California State Senator Aisha Wahab, who represents a large
*  constituency of South Asians, introduced a bill to add caste-based discrimination to the state's
*  anti-discrimination statutes.
*  So what ends up happening to this bill?
*  Well, you might think that an anti-discrimination bill would not be very controversial in a place like
*  California, which is generally a pretty progressive state.
*  But it actually ends up meeting with a lot of resistance and it sets off this huge, incredibly intense battle.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Amy, why does this bill arouse resistance?
*  Who ends up being most opposed to it?
*  So the people who have been most vocal in their opposition to this bill have been people within the
*  South Asian diaspora in the United States.
*  So they have been very, very active in going to local city council meetings, to the state capital, to
*  protest against the bill.
*  And they have been really angry.
*  We strongly oppose SB 403.
*  When there is not a single case of caste in American history, why are you making law?
*  No to SB 403, sir.
*  They lay out a few arguments.
*  We have never witnessed any existence of caste sentiments, let alone discrimination among the
*  vibrant community members.
*  They say that caste-based discrimination doesn't really exist in the United States.
*  We know discrimination is covered by existing laws.
*  Or maybe it happens here or there, but it's really not that big of a problem and certainly not big
*  enough to justify a bill.
*  They also say that a lot of people came here from South Asia to America in order to start a new
*  life and leave behind these ancient systems of caste.
*  I have no knowledge of my own caste and I don't see the point in introducing it as a bill.
*  And by passing this law, that it will only bring caste back into the conversation in a way that will
*  impose an identity on them that they don't actively practice.
*  We are looking to heal and I don't understand how the introduction of a caste system would help in
*  healing.
*  I just want to make sure I understand it.
*  Some of the people opposed to this law are basically saying it will force caste on them in a
*  way that caste doesn't exist for them.
*  It will make it more important in their lives than they want it to be, which is pretty fascinating.
*  Right.
*  As soon as you use the word caste, you ask a thousand Californians.
*  They will say caste word is linked to Hinduism.
*  And one of the arguments that you hear the most is that this law banning caste discrimination will
*  actually lead to more discrimination.
*  This is purely injustice for Indian Americans and particularly Hindus.
*  Particularly against Hindus.
*  My kids went to school here right down the street.
*  I have lived in the city for 25 years.
*  I've never felt more discriminated in this country than right now.
*  Hmm.
*  What's the thinking there?
*  Well, the people who make this argument say that because caste, due to the average American,
*  it's associated with Indians and Hindus in particular.
*  So that this law will actually end up targeting a very specific group of people.
*  So unlike broad categories like gender or race or sexual orientation, which affect many
*  different people, this bill actually only really affects a small subset of people and that it will
*  make Hindus in particular, especially vulnerable to accusations of discrimination.
*  So Amy, when, for example, Hindus opposed to this bill speak out against it and make the argument
*  you just made, what specific situations are they worried about?
*  Well, I spoke to one professor who is Hindu and teaches at a university in California, and he said
*  that, for example, he serves on his university's tenure committee and that committee really decides
*  whether or not a person should be granted tenure.
*  And it's oftentimes a very contentious decision.
*  And he said that he's nervous now that because of this bill, he will have a target on his back,
*  that if he participates in a decision not to grant someone tenure, that that person could potentially
*  go back to him and accuse him of caste based discrimination.
*  And he would be more open to accusations of discrimination than the rest of his colleagues because he is Hindu.
*  So he really doesn't want to see this law passed because he feels like it will make his job really hard and he won't be
*  able to participate in these types of activities that as a professor one is expected often to do.
*  So a big argument being made here, it sounds like, is that in a litigious society, a new law that creates a new category
*  of discrimination and protection against it is not without some real world potential implications and costs.
*  Right. These people say that they don't engage in caste discrimination, but that in their everyday decisions,
*  everything from hiring and firing to who they bring on as tenants, that this will introduce a new level of legal
*  apparel and fear and make them worry that they might be open to being sued when there's actually nothing going on.
*  On the other hand, I wonder if it feels like some of these arguments from opponents are actually being made in good
*  faith. And let me explain. I mean, these arguments do make sense on their face, right?
*  No one wants to be open to a lawsuit that they weren't open to before.
*  But this whole list of arguments by those opposed to the law feels familiar in the context of American history.
*  I struggle to think of an anti-discrimination law that didn't arouse similar arguments from people who felt that the
*  problem was being overstated.
*  Right. It was sporadic.
*  It's not systematic or worried it opened them to lawsuits or targeted them as a source of discrimination.
*  Surely there were men who didn't like when laws started to protect women against gender based discrimination.
*  So is it possible that what's happening here is that?
*  I do think that many opponents of the bill are making these arguments in good faith and that they really are worried
*  about being targeted and that this law might be misused against them.
*  But the supporters of the bill say that in their view, this concern is really outweighed by the stories people are
*  sharing about what's happened to them.
*  And they suggest that just because some South Asians don't experience caste based discrimination or don't see it in
*  their own social circles doesn't mean that it's not happening or that it won't happen in the future.
*  But of course, one side is poised to win this debate, right?
*  Governor Newsom, a Democrat, is expected to sign this bill into law.
*  Members of his party passed it.
*  And the conflict that you have just laid out here suggests that enforcing it once it becomes law is going to be kind of
*  tricky, right?
*  Yes, it will definitely be a challenge.
*  I mean, once this becomes law and lawsuits are filed, we're going to start seeing American jurors who really don't have
*  much experience or knowledge about the caste system, which is this hugely complex thing that's very nuanced.
*  It's been around for thousands of years and intersects with cultures and religions that they're going to have to start
*  adjudicating on this issue.
*  But this is also how our legal system works.
*  You pass a law and case laws built and precedent slowly are formed.
*  And I think that ultimately what people who support the bill would say is that the hope is we can create a place for
*  people like Beam who have experienced this type of caste based discrimination to be able to really feel comfortable
*  coming forward and seeking justice and that ultimately they will have the protections that they were hoping to have
*  when they came here in the first place.
*  Well, Amy, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you so much, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Sunday night, after a hundred and forty six day strike that crippled Hollywood, the union representing more than
*  eleven thousand TV and film writers said it had reached a tentative deal with entertainment companies that if approved
*  would bring its members back to work.
*  Back to work.
*  Exact details were unclear, but the Times reports that the deal delivered much of what the writers had demanded,
*  including higher royalty payments for streaming content and guarantees that artificial intelligence won't encroach on
*  writers credits and compensation.
*  And the U.S.
*  government is on track to shut down in less than a week unless House Speaker Kevin McCarthy can meet the demands of a
*  small group of far right lawmakers who have called for deep cuts to annual spending.
*  Because Republicans hold such a slim majority in the House and because House Democrats refused to support the
*  Republican spending bills, the far right lawmakers have the power to cripple the entire federal government.
*  They have already blocked several attempts to extend government funding by just a few months to avoid a shutdown.
*  All we want to do is have responsible government.
*  You can't keep spending seven trillion dollars when you're only taking in five trillion.
*  That just doesn't work.
*  And it's completely dysfunctional.
*  In an interview with CNN on Sunday, one of those far right Republicans, Representative Tim Burchett of Tennessee,
*  defended his approach.
*  That's why folks like me, you know, we're sticking to our guns.
*  You know, we're sticking to our guns and all of a sudden we're the bad guys because we want to balance our budget.
*  Without a compromise, the government will begin to shut down shortly after midnight on October 1st.
