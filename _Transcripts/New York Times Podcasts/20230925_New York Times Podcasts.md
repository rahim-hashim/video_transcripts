*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Borrow.
*  This is a Daily.
*  Today, California is about to become the first state in the country to outlaw discrimination
*  based on a person's caste.
*  My colleague Amy Chin, on why so many now believe, a prejudice that originated on the other
*  side of the globe now requires legal protection in the US and why so many are equally convinced
*  that it's a bad idea that will backfire.
*  It's Monday, September 25th.
*  Amy, I wonder if you can tell us about this piece of legislation which was recently passed
*  by California's democratically controlled legislature and now sits on the desk of its
*  Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom.
*  So the bill is called Senate Bill 403 or SB 403 for short and essentially it will make
*  caste discrimination illegal in California and that means everywhere from housing to employment,
*  discrimination based on caste will not be allowed.
*  It will become a protected characteristic just like sex, gender, sexual orientation, people
*  will not be able to discriminate on that basis.
*  So just define this word, caste.
*  I think we all have a little bit of a sense of what it means but would benefit from hearing
*  you explain it.
*  So the caste system is one of the oldest systems of social stratification and it began in India
*  thousands of years ago.
*  It has its roots in Hinduism and essentially it's a rigid social hierarchy that people
*  are born into.
*  And the system really govern everything about people's lives from who they marry to the
*  job that they did.
*  And at a very basic level you have at the top of this hierarchy the Brahmins who historically
*  were priests.
*  They had access to education and were considered the purist.
*  Then you have the warrior caste, the merchant caste, the laborer caste and at the very bottom
*  you had what were known as the quote unquote untouchables who preferred to call themselves
*  delits.
*  And they were considered to be so impure that they were outcasts and they were relegated
*  to doing jobs that were also seen as impure like street sweeping or toilet cleaning and
*  they couldn't even drink from the same well water as other castes.
*  Over time the system spread throughout South Asia and spread to other religious communities
*  like to Christians and Sikhs.
*  And the caste hierarchy was also reinforced under British colonial rule.
*  And then in the mid 20th century caste discrimination was outlawed in countries like India and
*  Nepal.
*  But of course we know that just because you banned something on paper doesn't mean it actually
*  is gone in practice.
*  And so caste is still a very strong marker of identity in many places and you can see
*  it in the privileges that people have and their social circles and the kinds of opportunities
*  that they have access to.
*  And this is really still present across South Asia.
*  Much in the way I imagine that when racial prejudice in the US is outlawed it nevertheless
*  keeps happening just because it's banned in a law doesn't mean it doesn't persist.
*  Right.
*  And some people have drawn that parallel.
*  The journalist Isabel Wilkerson wrote a bestselling book called Cast and she compared the
*  caste system in India to the way that race operates in America.
*  The idea that you can be born into a certain hierarchy and that it can be extremely difficult
*  to escape your circumstances.
*  So the fact Amy that there's a bill in California about caste discrimination now suggests that
*  lawmakers there believe that this is not just something that remains a problem overseas
*  in South Asia but it has somehow been imported into the United States.
*  That's right.
*  They've been hearing from their constituents in California that this is becoming a bigger
*  and bigger problem in the diaspora and that in order to protect residents of California
*  they need to have a bill specifically focusing on caste discrimination in order to prevent
*  this type of discrimination from happening in the future.
*  But why right now?
*  I mean you just referred to a diaspora.
*  Who from South Asia have been coming to California for generations?
*  Why this moment for this bill to resolve this problem?
*  So it really has to do with patterns of immigration.
*  After a big immigration act in 1965 was passed in the United States we saw a huge migration
*  of people from Asia including India to the United States.
*  A lot of those people that came over were people who were skilled workers.
*  They had degrees and were able to get jobs in the tech industry and the medical industry
*  in the United States.
*  And a lot of these people in India who were able to have the resources to get these types
*  of degrees work from the upper caste.
*  And so for a long time caste discrimination didn't really exist or at least people didn't
*  think it really existed because everyone was from the same caste.
*  But that's changed over time as the composition of the people who are coming from India has
*  also changed.
*  In large part that has to do with certain changes that are happening in India itself,
*  the country has put in place a system of essentially affirmative action where there are
*  quotas now for people from lower caste to go to universities to occupy government positions.
*  We are now starting to see the effects of those affirmative action policies where you had
*  a lot of people who were from lower caste going to these universities and now they suddenly
*  have the degrees to get those skilled worker visas to come to the US.
*  And so the people who are coming over from India to the United States are actually much more
*  diverse.
*  And in California we've really seen that shift happen because a lot of these people are
*  coming to work in IT jobs specifically in Silicon Valley, which is why we're seeing so much
*  of this issue being debated in California now.
*  Suddenly a much more diverse group of South Asians are in place like California and I'm
*  going to guess that that creates a greater opportunity for potential conflict once they
*  arrive.
*  Right.
*  And the caste issue really burst into public consciousness in 2020 when California brought
*  a lawsuit against Cisco, which is a pretty well known tech company.
*  And in the lawsuit, an employee who is from a Dalit background accused two of his bosses
*  who are from upper caste backgrounds of discriminating against him in his job on the basis of caste.
*  He said that they had given him less pay that they had denied certain opportunities to him
*  in the workplace and the state on his behalf was suing Cisco.
*  And this really led to a huge conversation in California, I think, in a way that we hadn't
*  seen before.
*  And this was taking place at around the same time as the death of George Floyd had sparked
*  the Black Lives Matter movement.
*  And suddenly people were able to describe their experiences of caste discrimination using
*  vocabulary that was understandable to people who understood it in the context of race.
*  And it's like systemic discrimination and oppressed communities.
*  These are all concepts that now the public was much more familiar with.
*  Fascinating.
*  So the conversation going on in the US in the wake of George Floyd's death, this wrenching
*  conversation about race, oppression, systemic racism, that is giving people from South
*  Asia a framework for thinking about the discrimination that they believe they are experiencing here
*  in the US that's been imported from South Asia.
*  That's right.
*  And it's around this time that people started to feel more comfortable talking about their
*  experiences with caste discrimination.
*  I mean, we heard stories about people experiencing wage theft at the hands of their uppercast bosses.
*  There were people talking about social exclusion that they weren't being allowed to eat from
*  the same cups and plates as Brahmin employers.
*  I spoke with one doctor in California who said that when other doctors in her city had
*  found out that she was from a lower caste, they stopped referring patients to her practice.
*  And one person that I spoke to really stood out to me.
*  His name was beam Narayan Vishokarma.
*  Hello.
*  Hi, Ben.
*  How are you?
*  He's 44.
*  He works at a convenience store in El Srito, California.
*  And he's from Nepal originally.
*  And he told me that he had experienced caste-based discrimination growing up in Nepal.
*  While growing at the child, I was not that much respected.
*  It's basically when it comes to entering a friend's house.
*  When he would hang out with his friends, his friends' parents would let him go into their
*  homes because he was from a lower caste.
*  And I used to feel like, oh, I felt like insulted, discriminated.
*  So of course, one of the reasons to come to the US is caste-based discrimination.
*  And he eventually moved to California.
*  He got a job.
*  And at one point, a few years ago, he was looking for a room in a shared house and he found
*  a great one.
*  And on August 18, 2021, I visited the house.
*  He spoke with the landlord who was also from Nepal.
*  The landlord sawed his containment to welcome me as a tenant.
*  The landlord was really excited for him to move in as a single guy.
*  So presumably, he would be quiet and not too much of a disturbance.
*  Everything was finalized.
*  The landlord requested me the deposit to his account.
*  So he gives the landlord his deposit.
*  And everything seemed like it was fine.
*  But then six hours later, he gets a call from the landlord.
*  And the landlord says, sorry, I can't rent this room to you anymore.
*  But I was talking to me as I had a smooth and pleasant conversation with him and everything
*  was finalized that day.
*  Then I asked him what happened and why he clicked it over his words.
*  Beam said he was asking questions, you know, why?
*  And the landlord was giving all kinds of reasons.
*  He said he needs a room for family members who visit.
*  And Beam was just very confused.
*  And then all of a sudden, I suddenly remembered the scene where we exchanged our numbers.
*  And I think my name, I remember that when he had given the deposit to the landlord,
*  he had given him his full name.
*  And his last name is Bishwakarma, which in Nepal is associated with a lower caste.
*  And then Beam started to confront his landlord.
*  I told him that I know why you are denying.
*  I know the reason why you are denying the room to me.
*  But even before Beam himself said the word cast.
*  And he said, no, no, no, no, don't think that way.
*  Don't think that way.
*  It's not your cast.
*  It's not your cast.
*  See, I didn't even say a single word about my cast.
*  The landlord said, oh, no, no, it's not because of your cast.
*  Even though Beam hadn't mentioned cast at all.
*  That kind of tell.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  To Beam, it became obvious that actually it was because of his cast.
*  When that incident happened to me, I was kind of, oh my goodness.
*  I thought I left it back in Nepal.
*  But again, it came to the U.S.
*  Again, it's happening with the people.
*  I felt like, you know, I was like shattered.
*  That incident shattered my self-dignity, self-respect.
*  I felt like humiliated.
*  So definitely that incident had a heart meeting, actually.
*  He said he just was in such shock because he had never expected to experience
*  any of this kind of caste-based discrimination in the United States.
*  I mean, it's one of the reasons why he left Nepal.
*  Right.
*  So suddenly, he's finding that this vestige of his former life, that he was very happy
*  to leave behind, has actually followed him to California and reared its head in a pretty
*  ugly way, according to him.
*  That's right.
*  So what's the response to this growing awareness of caste discrimination as people like
*  Beam are telling the stories he told you?
*  So people start to say that there need to be more protections made explicit for people
*  who are experiencing caste-based discrimination.
*  So we start to see universities incorporate caste-based discrimination into their anti-discrimination
*  statutes, companies follow suit.
*  Earlier this year, we saw Seattle become the first U.S. city to ban caste-based discrimination.
*  And then in February this year, California State Senator Ayesha Wilhab, who represents
*  a large constituency of South Asians, introduced a bill to add caste-based discrimination to
*  the state's anti-discrimination statutes.
*  So what ends up happening to this bill?
*  Well, you might think that an anti-discrimination bill would not be very controversial in a
*  place like California, which is generally a pretty progressive state, but it actually ends
*  up meeting with a lot of resistance and it sets off this huge, incredibly intense battle.
*  So Amy, why does this bill arouse resistance?
*  Who ends up being most opposed to it?
*  So the people who have been most vocal in their opposition to this bill have been people
*  within the South Asian diaspora in the United States.
*  So they have been very, very active in going to local city council meetings to the state
*  capital to protest against the bill and they have been really angry.
*  We strongly oppose SB403.
*  When there is not a single case of caste in American history, why are you making law?
*  No, do SB403.
*  They lay out a few arguments.
*  We have never witnessed any existence of caste sentiments let alone discrimination among
*  the vibrant community members.
*  They say that caste-based discrimination doesn't really exist in the United States.
*  We know discrimination is covered by existing laws.
*  Or maybe it happens here or there, but it's really not that big of a problem and certainly
*  not big enough to justify a bill.
*  They also say that a lot of people came here from South Asia to America in order to start
*  a new life and leave behind these ancient systems of caste.
*  I had no knowledge of my own caste and I don't see the point in introducing it as a bill.
*  And by passing this law, that it will only bring caste back into the conversation in a
*  way that will impose an identity on them that they don't actively practice.
*  They are looking to heal and I don't understand how the introduction of a caste system would
*  help in healing.
*  Hmm, I just want to make sure I understand it.
*  Some of the people who posted this law are basically saying it will force caste on them
*  in a way that caste doesn't exist for them.
*  It will make it more important in their lives than they want it to be, which is pretty fascinating.
*  Right.
*  As soon as you use the word caste, you ask 1000 Californians.
*  They will say caste word is linked to Hinduism.
*  And one of the arguments that you hear the most is that this law banning caste discrimination
*  will actually lead to more discrimination.
*  This is purely injustice for Indian, Americans and particularly Hindus.
*  Particularly against Hindus.
*  My kids went to school here, right down the street.
*  I have lived in the city for 25 years.
*  I have never felt more discriminated in this country than right now.
*  Hmm, what's the thinking there?
*  Well, the people who make this argument say that because caste due to the average American,
*  it's associated with Indians and Hindus in particular.
*  So that this law will actually end up targeting a very specific group of people.
*  So unlike broad categories like gender or race or sexual orientation, which affect many
*  different people, this bill actually only really affects a small subset of people and
*  that it will make Hindus in particular, especially vulnerable to accusations of discrimination.
*  So Amy, when, for example, Hindus oppose to this bill, speak out against it and make
*  the argument you just made, what specific situations are they worried about?
*  Well, I spoke to one professor who is Hindu and teaches at a university in California.
*  And he said that, for example, he serves on his university's tenure committee.
*  And that committee really decides whether or not a person should be granted tenure.
*  And it's oftentimes a very contentious decision.
*  And he said that he's nervous now that because of this bill, he will have a target on his
*  back.
*  That if he participates in a decision not to grant someone tenure, that that person could
*  potentially go back to him and accuse him of caste-based discrimination.
*  And he would be more open to accusations of discrimination than the rest of his colleagues
*  because he is Hindu.
*  So he really doesn't want to see this law passed because he feels like it will make his
*  job really hard and he won't be able to participate in these types of activities that as a professor,
*  one is expected often to do.
*  So a big argument being made here, it sounds like, is that in a litigious society, a new
*  law that creates a new category of discrimination and protection against it is not without
*  some real world potential implications and costs.
*  Right.
*  These people say that they don't engage in caste discrimination, but that in their everyday
*  decisions, everything from hiring and firing to who they bring on as tenants, that this
*  will introduce a new level of legal peril and fear and make them worry that they might
*  be open to being sued when there's actually nothing going on.
*  On the other hand, I wonder if it feels like some of these arguments from opponents are
*  actually being made in good faith.
*  And let me explain.
*  These arguments do make sense on their face, right?
*  No one wants to be open to a lawsuit that they weren't open to before.
*  But this whole list of arguments by those opposed to a law feels familiar in the context
*  of American history.
*  I struggle to think of an anti-discrimination law that didn't arouse similar arguments
*  from people who felt that the problem was being overstated, right?
*  It was sporadic.
*  It's not systematic or worried it opened them to lawsuits or targeted them as a source
*  of discrimination.
*  Surely there were men who didn't like when laws started to protect women against gender
*  based discrimination.
*  So is it possible that what's happening here is that?
*  I do think that many opponents of the bill are making these arguments in good faith
*  and that they really are worried about being targeted and that this law might be misused
*  against them.
*  But the supporters of the bill say that in their view, this concern is really outweighed
*  by the stories people are sharing about what's happened to them.
*  And they suggest that just because some South Asians don't experience caste-based discrimination
*  or don't see it in their own social circles doesn't mean that it's not happening or that
*  it won't happen in the future.
*  But of course, one side is poised to win this debate, right?
*  Governor Newsom, a Democrat, is expected to sign this bill into law, members of his party
*  past it.
*  And the conflict that you have just laid out here suggests that enforcing it, once it
*  becomes law, is going to be kind of tricky, right?
*  Yes, it will definitely be a challenge.
*  I mean, once this becomes law and lawsuits are filed, we're going to start seeing American
*  jurors who really don't have much experience or knowledge about the caste system, which
*  is this hugely complex thing that's very nuanced.
*  It's been around for thousands of years and intersects with cultures and religions that
*  they're going to have to start adjudicating on this issue.
*  But this is also how our legal system works.
*  You pass a lot and case law is built and precedent slowly are formed.
*  And I think that ultimately what people who support the bill would say is that the hope
*  is we can create a place for people like Beam who have experienced this type of caste-based
*  discrimination to be able to really feel comfortable coming forward and seeking justice.
*  And that ultimately they will have the protections that they were hoping to have when they came
*  here in the first place.
*  Wait me.
*  Thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you so much, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need.
*  To another day.
*  On Sunday night, after 146 day strike that crippled Hollywood, the union representing more than
*  11,000 TV and film writers said it had reached a tentative deal with entertainment companies
*  that if approved would bring its members back to work.
*  Exact details were unclear, but the Times reports that the deal delivered much of what the
*  writers had demanded, including higher royalty payments for streaming content and guarantees
*  that artificial intelligence won't encroach on writers' credits and compensation.
*  And the US government is on track to shut down in less than a week unless House Speaker
*  Kevin McCarthy can meet the demands of a small group of far-right lawmakers who have called
*  for deep cuts to annual spending.
*  Because Republicans hold such a slim majority in the House, and because House Democrats
*  refused to support the Republican spending bills, the far-right lawmakers have the power
*  to cripple the entire federal government.
*  They have already blocked several attempts to extend government funding by just a few months
*  to avoid a shutdown.
*  All we want to do is have responsible government.
*  You can't keep spending $7 trillion when you're only taking in 5 trillion.
*  That just doesn't work, and it's completely dysfunctional.
*  In an interview with CNN on Sunday, one of those far-right Republicans, representative Tim
*  Birchett of Tennessee, defended his approach.
*  That's why folks like me, you know, we're sticking to our guns and all of a sudden we're
*  the bad guys because we want to balance our budget.
*  Without a compromise, the government will begin to shut down shortly after midnight on October
*  1st.
