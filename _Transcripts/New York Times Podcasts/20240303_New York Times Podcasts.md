# The Sunday Read: ‘How Tom Sandoval Became the Most Hated Man in America’
**NewYorkTimesPodcasts:** [March 03, 2024](https://rr4---sn-ab5sznlk.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?expire=1710971734&ei=9gb7Ze3OJb28_9EP-5yMmAo&ip=128.59.179.6&id=o-ANpElIzQDyJgF9wS-gy1j5mixyRfPE2Tt8K2x-P6qaqV&itag=139&source=youtube&requiressl=yes&xpc=EgVo2aDSNQ%3D%3D&mh=pT&mm=31%2C26&mn=sn-ab5sznlk%2Csn-p5qs7nzy&ms=au%2Conr&mv=m&mvi=4&pl=16&initcwndbps=2335000&vprv=1&mime=audio%2Fmp4&gir=yes&clen=17929515&dur=2940.047&lmt=1709464575216254&mt=1710949983&fvip=4&keepalive=yes&c=ANDROID_EMBEDDED_PLAYER&txp=6218224&sparams=expire%2Cei%2Cip%2Cid%2Citag%2Csource%2Crequiressl%2Cxpc%2Cvprv%2Cmime%2Cgir%2Cclen%2Cdur%2Clmt&sig=AJfQdSswRQIgfLRgob0dznk00hbIPY1D25eIPwt9o5cVS5N042OqnoMCIQDVAckskktMJYaA8_Z7zCdQo_90ye-Fg7R7l5lvsYnYTQ%3D%3D&lsparams=mh%2Cmm%2Cmn%2Cms%2Cmv%2Cmvi%2Cpl%2Cinitcwndbps&lsig=ALClDIEwRgIhAJjexJg90E2IHz-7K25WSOtFSMLPn0qaMIuH0W3kWIUnAiEA4cSiTtidoy59K-iosTbtY4qKLZAOQ1aqWDjOCKEkCUQ%3D)
*  Even if you don't watch Reality TV, you've probably heard about something called Scandival.
*  Scandival, I believe it's called Scandival.
*  It's the so-called Scandival that's rocking reality TV.
*  Scandival, oh, look, you're from God.
*  Scandival, I love it.
*  Scandival refers to a revelation so explosive.
*  It generated its own nickname and turned to band bump rules,
*  a show on Bravo currently in its 11th season,
*  into a household name last year.
*  Suddenly in a fair, a thing that's happened on many reality shows without much consequence
*  became a top headline on CNN and The New York Times.
*  Tom Sandvall cheating on his longtime girlfriend Ariana Maddox
*  with her best friend Rachel Levis, gaining the moniker Scandival.
*  Hashtag Scandival racking up more than 146 million views on TikTok alone.
*  At a point when most other shows would be on live support,
*  band bump rules became the most watched cable series among 18 to 49-year-olds.
*  It was also nominated for an Emmy,
*  an honor that has never been granted to any of Bravo's housewives shows.
*  What's more, this entire series of events was incited by one figure,
*  a man whose infidelity led to one of the most compelling seasons in the history of reality TV,
*  who turned himself into the ultimate villain and seemingly ruined his life in the process.
*  Tom Sandvall.
*  Do you want anything?
*  For you to die.
*  My name is Irene Alexander and I'm a contributing writer for The New York Times magazine
*  based in Los Angeles.
*  I've always watched a lot of both scripted and reality TV,
*  but if you're a person like me who's interested in studying people and analyzing their motivations,
*  it's often more fun to do that with real, unpredictable people rather than characters
*  conceived by Hollywood writers.
*  And so for this week's Sunday read, I wrote a piece for the magazine about Tom Sandvall,
*  a reality TV star who's been on band-up on rules for the past 10 plus years.
*  I wanted to understand what it was like to have his name become synonymous,
*  with arguably one of the best seasons of reality TV ever made.
*  And simultaneously, have maybe the worst year he's ever had personally.
*  I don't know how it happened, it just, it happened.
*  We became really good friends.
*  Like I was seeking something that I wasn't getting here.
*  And that's selfish, it's really selfish.
*  Selfish is the nicest word you could use.
*  What's interesting about Vanderpump rules is that it started out as a show about
*  waiters and bartenders who lived in crappy apartments in Hollywood.
*  They worked at Sir Restaurant, an acronym for Sexy Unique Restaurant,
*  which technically means that its full name is Sexy Unique Restaurant Restaurant,
*  a business owned by Lisa Vanderpump, a former real housewife.
*  Most of them wanted to be models and actors, or quote-unquote,
*  actors as they like to say on the show.
*  Over time, as the show gained success, they became reality TV stars instead.
*  And Vanderpump rules became a sort of meta reality show about reality stars.
*  When the series began in 2013, Tom was relatively well-liked.
*  He was a regular guy from the Midwest who loved his friends and hoped to make it as an actor.
*  But then, over the course of the series, he'd changed.
*  You could say he got swallowed up by the Hollywood fame machine,
*  which tends to play all kinds of tricks on your ego and self-perception.
*  So when news broke last spring, that he'd been having an affair with another cast member,
*  behind the backs of the show's producers and his co-star and partner of nine years are
*  aion of Maddox. It seemed both shocking and not.
*  A lot of people have debated why the scandal became national news.
*  Part of it was that it came to light when the 10th season of the show was midway through airing.
*  That turned it into a murder mystery of sorts, with viewers hunting for clues of the affair
*  in earlier episodes and presenting their elaborate theories on social media.
*  All right, so I'm thinking that the affair started on this cast trip because notice how Rachel
*  literally posted picture with sand of all first.
*  Happy Sunday, you guys. We're going to talk Vanderpump rules. We have a lot of details to get through,
*  so I'm going to speed this up to two times speed.
*  After the scandal, aion got so much national sympathy as a result of being cheated on,
*  that she's had the best year of her career.
*  She was invited to the White House correspondence dinner,
*  competed on dancing with the stars, and landed brand advertisements with
*  Dersel batteries, lace chips, and big razors, as well as the starring role in Chicago on Broadway
*  The Swinter. For Tom, the vitriol was swift. It didn't come just from fans online who posted
*  mean messages, or from famous people like Amy Schumer, who called them a narcissist.
*  He's basically the Donald Trump of Expo-e-France.
*  Don't go away, won't say he's sorry, so you would...
*  That guy that would just so...
*  Yeah, so you don't like him.
*  His close friends distanced themselves.
*  His own brother asked them to delete photos of them together on social media.
*  A bar he co-owned spanned him from coming in over the summer because his presence became bad for
*  business. As I reported in this piece, no one seemed to be able to fully explain why the
*  so-called scandal broke Vanderpump's cult status barrier and turned it into a national phenomenon.
*  But I wasn't all that interested in that question anyway.
*  I wanted to know more about the guy at the center of the storm.
*  There really hadn't been a show before, in which we put regular people on television
*  for much of their 20s and 30s, and then got to see how they fare as a result.
*  What were the consequences of that for him, and for us as viewers?
*  A lot of people assume that reality TV is fake.
*  But for Tom Sandeval, there's virtually no separation between his existence on screen and off.
*  Living on a reality show has fundamentally changed the way he thinks about his life,
*  which he often talks about not in years and months, like the rest of us, but in seasons and episodes.
*  As I spent time with Tom for the story, sometimes he'd pause mid-sentence and stare into space,
*  like a doll whose batteries have died, until whatever noise interfering ambulance or helicopter
*  roaring by had passed. And then he'd continue as if nothing had happened, even when he wasn't being filmed.
*  There was something really fascinating to me about someone who spent the majority of his
*  adult life living on a reality show, and as a result, had lost touch with actual reality.
*  I think one of the most revealing moments was when Tom and I drove from his home in LA's Valley
*  Village to Tom Tom, a bar he's part owner of in West Hollywood. It was the only part of our time
*  together when we weren't supervised by a publicist, and he was even more forthcoming and unguarded.
*  He told me how difficult this year has been, how betrayed he's felt by his friends,
*  and how he'd been struggling with depression. At the same time, he said he was really honored to be
*  on Vanderpump Rules. He said this incredible thing, which was, the scandal made the show so big,
*  it's kind of cool and crazy, even though it's negative and at my expense. In other words,
*  even though he recognizes the ways it's been damaging to him personally, he ultimately sees the
*  experience of being on the show as a net positive, and he's excited to keep going.
*  So here's my article, how Tom Sandeval became the most hated man in America,
*  read by Julia Whalen. Our audio producer today is Adrian Hurst. The original music you'll hear
*  was written and performed by Aaron Esposito.
*  Valley Village is a Los Angeles neighborhood just across the freeway from Studio City,
*  near the southern edge of the area locally referred to with both affection and
*  derision as the Valley. There, at the end of a quiet leafy street of ranch-style homes,
*  stands what real estate agents have come to describe as a modern farmhouse,
*  which its current occupant, the reality TV star Tom Sandeval, has outfitted with landscaping
*  lights that rotate in a spectrum of colors, mimicking the dance floor of a nightclub.
*  The home is both his private residence and an occasional TV set for the Bravo reality show Vander
*  Pump Rules. After a series of events that came to be known as Scandival, Paparazzi had been
*  camped outside, but by the new year it was just one or two guys, and now they have mostly gone too.
*  Scandival is the nickname for Sandeval's affair with another cast member,
*  which he had behind the backs of the show's producers and his girlfriend of nine years.
*  This wouldn't be interesting or noteworthy, except that in 2023, after being on the air for
*  10 seasons, Vander Pump was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Unstructured Reality Program,
*  an honor that has never been bestowed on any of the network's housewives shows.
*  It also became, by a key metric, the most watched cable series in the advertiser beloved
*  demographic of 18 to 49-year-olds and brought in over 12.2 million viewers.
*  This happened last spring, when Hollywood's TV writers went on strike, and cable TV was declared dead,
*  and our culture had already become so fractured that it was rare for anything,
*  let alone an episode of television to become a national event. And yet, you probably heard about
*  Scandival, even if you couldn't care less about who these people are exactly.
*  The story has continued off-screen. After the season aired, Requel Levis, with whom Sandeval had
*  the affair, entered a mental health facility in Arizona and started going by a different name.
*  Ariana Maddox, Sandeval's now ex-girlfriend, garnered so much national sympathy that she has
*  had the most prosperous year of her career. In addition to being invited to the White House
*  correspondence dinner and to compete on Dancing with the Stars, she landed ads with dorisal
*  batteries, big razors, uber eats, and laze chips, as well as a starring role in Chicago on Broadway
*  this winter. Sandeval, meanwhile, became the most reviled man in America and the butt of a million
*  jokes. Jennifer Lawrence made fun of his skin, Amy Schumer called him a narcissist. One of the hosts
*  of the view called him the Donald Trump of ex-boyfriends. And Sandeval has just been here in the valley
*  trying to process it all. I feel like I got more hate than Danny Masterson, he told me, and he's a
*  convicted rapist. When I arrived at his house late last year, Sandeval, who is 41, had just finished
*  working out. He wore a black muscle shirt and a wide headband. His assistant, Miles, was at the
*  dining room table sorting through Sandeval's utility bills on two laptops. He basically does
*  anything I don't personally have to do. Sandeval explained. We were also joined by Riley, who is on
*  Sandeval's new publicity team, which has a background in crisis PR. I assumed Riley would be an
*  impediment, but my fears were put to rest when she didn't flinch at the Danny Masterson comment.
*  Riley is 23, has watched Vanderpump since she was in middle school and seemed as interested
*  in Sandeval's life as I was. When Sandeval described how, despite their gnarly, nationally televised
*  split, he and Maddox have continued living together, so questored in separate parts of the five
*  bedroom home and communicating via assistance, Riley was curious to hear more. So all of her stuff
*  is still here. Riley asked. Sandeval wasn't sure, but he thought Maddox might have finally rented a
*  place. She took the dog in the cat, and I know she wouldn't do that if she was staying somewhere
*  temporary, he said. Sandeval wanted to buy out her share of the home, but interest rates are so
*  crazy right now. He was considering getting a roommate to help with the mortgage. At least he
*  thought Maddox was finally open to the idea. It took her a while to not be spiteful about the house,
*  he said. A month after we met, Maddox sued Sandeval in Los Angeles County to force him to sell the
*  home and divide the proceeds. My tape recorder wasn't on yet, and Sandeval wanted to make sure I was
*  getting everything. Do you want to like record this? Of course I wanted to record this. I couldn't
*  remember interviewing a public figure as eager to speak into a recording device, but then again,
*  Sandeval is not a typical celebrity, nor is Vanderpump, which is currently airing its 11th season,
*  your typical show. Early reality series like Big Brother and Survivor rotated casts in every season.
*  Shows that didn't, like the hills, never lasted this long. Even its closest point of comparison,
*  Bravo's Real Housewives franchise is more of a weekly cage match in which bloodied fighters are
*  retired once they're no longer useful. And Sandeval, the Midwest bread son of a firefighter and a
*  marketing executive, is not a Kardashian. What I mean is that although reality programming has been
*  a dominant part of American culture for over two decades, we've never actually put a regular person
*  on reality TV to live out much of their adult life and gotten to see what happens to them as a result.
*  Contrary to a popular misconception, Vanderpump is not about Lisa Vanderpump, a former Bravo
*  Housewife. It started as a show about waiters and bartenders who lived in crappy apartments around
*  Hollywood, and for the most part, wanted to be actors. That dream didn't work out, but they
*  became reality TV stars instead. For a while, this ruined the show. It became less honest.
*  The cast still worked shifts at a restaurant, but actually they drove nice cars and bought two
*  million dollar houses. Once the show stopped pretending that nothing had changed, it turned out that
*  a reality show about reality stars was not any less interesting. On the last season alone,
*  there was Sandeval, in which Sandeval, a reality star approaching middle age,
*  proceeded to start a cover band, open a bar, and sleep with Levis, a former beauty queen.
*  A couple that had been on the show since the first season finally decided to divorce,
*  leading the wife to realize that she may never have kids. And a woman who once bragged that her
*  private jet lifestyle was financed by Randall Emmett, the director video film producer, left him
*  and became a breadwinner as she fought for custody of their daughter.
*  Alex Baskin, an executive producer of Vanderpump, developed it as a spin-off of real housewives of
*  Beverly Hills, which featured Vanderpump as the owner of several mediocre restaurants.
*  Baskin noticed that Sir, which stands for sexy, unique restaurant, indeed had a sexy,
*  unique atmosphere. In 2011, he sent a screenshot of Sir's website with Vanderpump on a throne
*  surrounded by her good-looking staff, to Andy Cohen, who was then Bravo's vice president for
*  original programming. The network provided a small budget for Baskin to explore the idea.
*  What Baskin found was an incestuous friend group in which everyone was either living or sleeping
*  with one another. It was everything you look for in a TV show. Baskin told me. It just hit me in the face.
*  At the time, prestige TV was on the rise, and writers' rooms across Hollywood became overly preoccupied
*  with chasing critical approval, rather than audiences and revenue. In this context,
*  Vanderpump was an appealing alternative. Yes, it looked and acted like reality TV, but at its core,
*  it was more like the great scripted shows of the 1990s, in that it was about a group of friends
*  living life, dating one another, giving up the hopes of their 20s for the realities of their 30s.
*  It relied on time-tested screenwriting tenets, good, unexpected stories about original characters,
*  going through relatable cycles of jealousy, regret, insecurity, and longing.
*  The show was also a brilliant premise commercially speaking. The TV business shepherded crowds
*  to the real-world business and vice versa. You could watch Sandevol and his friends on TV,
*  then drop by and have him make you a pump-tiny. The show's main draw was the cheating scandals,
*  of which there were three by the end of the second season. As the show took place more outside
*  the restaurant, it went through an identity crisis. In 2020, it was further debilitated by the
*  pandemic and the departure of four members of the cast due to past racist incidents and resurfaced
*  social media posts. By season nine, there were rumors that Vanderpump was on the brink of cancellation.
*  We were hobbling, Basque and told me. The very next season,
*  Scandival dropped into Bravo's lap. The show's producers treated it like a news story.
*  Late on the evening of March 1st, 2023, when principal filming for the 10th season was
*  wrapped and episodes were already airing, Sandevol was performing a new single with his band when his
*  phone fell out of his pocket. Maddox opened it to discover an intimate recording of Levis.
*  The next morning, Maddox notified the show's talent producer, who called the showrunner,
*  who called Basque and who called Bravo, which scrambled to approve budgets. On March 3rd,
*  crews were pulled off another Bravo set and cameras were back up to capture the fallout as the cast
*  processed the affair. The resulting footage, which aired in May, is an incredible episode of
*  television. Maddox, with damp hair and puffy cried out eyes, says, I loved you when you had nothing,
*  and that girl is searching for an identity in men, and I would have followed you anywhere.
*  Producers did not put cameras down, even a Sandevol screamed at them to stop filming him during
*  the subsequent reunion special, which was so brutal that Amy Schumer compared it to the end of
*  Schindler's list. No one, not Sandevol or Basque or even the executives at Bravo,
*  are quite sure why the season resonated the way it did. Maybe it was that Scandevol had awakened
*  something in everyone who had ever cheated or been cheated on, resulting in endless memes and
*  diatribe on social media, or that the affair landed in the news while the season was airing,
*  turning it into an interactive murder mystery of sorts, with viewers searching for clues in
*  earlier episodes. Now, it is easy to be cynical about these things. Isn't it plausible that when
*  faced with the shows on certain future producers got together with the cast and cooked up a cheating
*  scandal? This is a popular conspiracy theory, but Basque told me that the covert affair and
*  continuing fallout was too elaborate to manufacture. I mean, Raquel left the state, he said.
*  When I asked Sandevol, he insisted that if he was going to script a fake storyline,
*  it wouldn't have been one that destroyed his life. I would have never participated in that,
*  he said. Willingly, I said. You would have never participated in that willingly,
*  since you did technically continue to film the show. Right, willingly, he said. Hell no.
*  At Sandevol's house, he made a cup of tea, and Riley and I were listening to what the past year
*  of his life has been like. The thing with Levis started with what sounded like a midlife crisis.
*  You know when you just feel like you don't know what's cool anymore, he said. And your past
*  your prime and a little bit of a joke? Riley nodded. He started to feel as though his best years
*  were behind him. He wanted to feel alive again. He and Maddox had grown apart. He planned to tell
*  her about the affair after the season aired. He didn't want it to play out on the show. When he
*  shouted at producers to stop filming him, he couldn't remember another time in the show's history
*  that he'd done so, unless he was getting in the shower or something. I just wanted to not feel
*  watched, he said. I wanted to take a breath. After he finished filming, he went on tour with his
*  band, Tom Sandevol and the most extras. He had to. His bank accounts were overdrawn and he needed
*  the money. Crowds of people came out to hate on him. They showed up wearing t-shirts that said
*  cheater and worm with a mustache, a name one of his castmates coined. Everywhere he went, people
*  called him a loser or screamed team Ariana at him. When he returned home, there were groups of
*  strangers with cameras at his house who seemed to be making fun of him. On the show, Sandevol had
*  complained about always being the one to replenish batteries and other domestic supplies. Now,
*  as Maddox filmed her various commercial spots at the home, it had become ad copy for DuraSel.
*  I buy my own batteries now and big razors. I'm just starting a whole new, unclogged chapter in my
*  life. In June, a friend sent him a photo of sweet lady Jane, a popular bakery in Los Angeles,
*  selling cakes with Sandevol is a liar written in frosting. Sandevol's friends distanced themselves.
*  His brother asked him to delete photos of them together on Instagram.
*  Sandevol says he was asked to stop going in to Schwartz and Sandeys,
*  allowing in the Franklin Village neighborhood that he co-owns. The show's fans tanked the bars
*  yelp reviews and were harassing the staff. Somehow, people got Sandevol's cell number. His
*  phone started ringing at all hours with blocked numbers, with women pretending to be levis,
*  and men asking how they could find her. He started to feel as if he were in uncut jam.
*  The nerve-jolting, safty brothers movie in which the protagonist is isolated and on the run.
*  He got down, like really down. His mind went to some dark places. Friend suggested that he
*  get on well butren. In April, he quit drinking, hence the tea he was now sipping. He did it for levis.
*  When she entered that facility in Arizona, he assumed they would be together once she got out.
*  But then levis stopped talking to him and hasn't returned his calls since June.
*  She never even gave me any closure, he said. It was really hard. It still messes with me.
*  He even tried reaching out through her publicist, but got no response.
*  When Vanderpump started filming season 11 in June, Sandevol was off doing special forces,
*  the reality show on Fox that puts celebrities through pseudo-military training.
*  I'm here because I want to get punished. Sandevol says on the show, before he's dunked in
*  frigid waters and dragged across a field on the former Nickelodeon star JoJo Siwa's back.
*  When Sandevol didn't win the competition, he felt robbed. He thought producers made it look as
*  though he got eliminated before Siwa, who voluntarily withdrew. They said she lasted longer than me,
*  he said, but she most definitely did not. He was convinced that producers didn't want him to win.
*  Who did they want to win? Riley asked, incredulous.
*  In the fall, he thought things might finally be turning. He started his own podcast and
*  titled it Everybody Loves Tom. An early guest was Dr. Drew, who dug into Sandevol's childhood
*  trauma and declared him not a narcissist, at least as far as the DSM-5 is concerned.
*  The actor Jerry O'Connell came on and apologized for having t-shirts made that said team
*  Ariana. But the following month at BravoCon, the annual Las Vegas Convention for the Network Super
*  Fans, Sandevol arrived on stage to booze from the 8,000-member audience. I asked Sandevol why he
*  thought the scandal got so big. I'm not a pop culture historian really, he said, but I witnessed
*  the O.J. Simpson thing and George Floyd and all these big things, which is really weird to
*  compare this to that, I think. But do you think in a weird way it's a little bit the same?
*  I looked over it, Riley, who was typing furiously on her phone. I think I knew what he meant.
*  He was trying to express the audity of becoming the symbolic center of a nationwide discussion
*  and a major news story. What he communicated instead was something more honest, which is just how
*  much the experience had made him lose perspective. I did what I did because I was in an unhappy place
*  in my life, he said. I got caught up in my emotions and fully fell in love, like, for real.
*  He sighed and drained his teacup. Then he got up, put on some upbeat music and went upstairs to get
*  ready for a night out. Sometimes he says too much, Riley said, and the following day forgets what he
*  says. Then she went upstairs to have a quick word with him. The next day, I was supposed to attend
*  the taping of one of Santa Valls' confessional interviews for the show. I was about to get in my
*  car when I received a text from his publicist, Riley's boss. He'd rather you don't attend today,
*  it read. He's not feeling the best. The next morning, I got a call from Bascon, and the day after
*  that, a Bravo publicist rang me late on a Friday. Some of what Santa Valls had said had gotten back to
*  Bravo, and everyone was concerned. What was it that he said about O. J. Simpson and George Floyd
*  exactly? Maybe Santa Valls wasn't ready for this. The Bravo publicist asked if I really needed to
*  see Santa Valls again. Could the network facilitate an interview with one of the show's other stars?
*  Bravo said it would get back to me about next steps. While I waited, I thought more about Santa Valls.
*  When you're lost, sometimes it's helpful to go back to the beginning.
*  Santa Valls arrived in Los Angeles in 2004 with the hopes of becoming an actor. When he was growing
*  up in St. Louis, it was all he wanted to be. I loved to pretend he told me and Riley. I loved it
*  more than sports. At 15, he started modeling. He briefly lived in Miami, that swampy hub of male
*  modeling, where he was photographed by Bruce Weber for one of his infamous Abercrombie and Fitch
*  campaigns. In Los Angeles, he worked as a pool boy at the Mondrian Hotel and as a cater waiter,
*  while booking ad campaigns for rock and republic, Ed Hardy, and Von Dutch, the early odds brands
*  are coming back now. Oh, Von Dutch, I love that brand, Riley said.
*  I had a versatile look, Santa Valls explained. Because I could do this like, Daddy doesn't love me
*  emo look, and I could do a more slick back look. He signed up for Vanderpump rules because he thought
*  people should see what it's like being an LA Mactor, a model actor. Like driving down the 405,
*  he said, changing clothes, comp cards, and headshots, split all over my backseat.
*  When the show became known instead for his girlfriend sleeping with his friend Jack's tailor,
*  Santa Valls didn't mind. When I punched Jack's, he said, that sent it into the stratosphere.
*  Riley remembered watching that episode with her middle school friends.
*  We were like, this show is epic, she said. Dude, it was, Santa Valls said. It was so cool, Riley said.
*  A decade later, Santa Valls, who had a boyish innocence about him in those early seasons,
*  has morphed into a unique Los Angeles species. He's late to everything. His publicist never
*  seems to be able to reach him, and his face has that taught sheen that celebrities get from
*  anti-aging protocols. He talks about his life not in years, but in seasons and episodes.
*  Sometimes he pauses mid-sentence and stares into the middle distance, like a doll whose wind up
*  key has jammed until whatever ambulance, helicopter, or other sound interfering entity has passed,
*  and then he continues as if nothing happened, even when there are no mics or cameras on him.
*  The ceiling lights in his home are taped over with sheets of paper to diffuse light and make it
*  optimal for filming. He used to remove them during the off season, but now he doesn't bother.
*  We leave them up there because otherwise they'll just do it again, he said.
*  Santa Valls can't always tell if he's living for himself, or the show, or both.
*  Sometimes he really has to talk to his best friend and co-star Tom Schwartz, but he knows he
*  shouldn't via text, so he will call producers and ask how quickly they could have cameras on him
*  to film it. He feels terrible when he has to bring up something that he knows could be damaging
*  to his castmates, but that is part of the job. The worst thing Santa Valls says you can hear while
*  filming is the dreaded, hey, can I talk to you for a minute? That's when you know you're about
*  to be called out for something. Baskin calls this hyper-reality. In real life, you might go to a
*  dinner party and then go home and gossip about your friends. On a reality show, you're encouraged
*  to say those things in the moment. Santa Valls is so well-trained at narrating his innermost thoughts
*  out loud that he sometimes has to remind himself not to do it outside of filming. You lose track
*  of what a normal conversation would be like with people that aren't on the show, he said.
*  Despite the year he had, he told me that he was really honored to be on Vanderpump.
*  The scandal has made the show so big, it's kind of cool and crazy, he said, even though it's negative
*  and at my expense.
*  Unlike actors, reality show participants are not protected by the screen actors' guild,
*  at least not for unscripted work, meaning they're not entitled to residuals or union pay
*  minimums. When Santa Valls joined Vanderpump, each cast member made $10,000 for the entire first
*  season. Today, the original cast makes closer to $35,000 per episode. As the genre has grown,
*  participants can make almost as much from other revenue streams, like books, podcasts,
*  and brand partnerships, some of which can pay upward of $250,000. Because of this,
*  what's good for Vanderpump is generally good for Sandevol, monetarily speaking, even if it can
*  also make his life more difficult. Opportunities often grow directly out of plotlines. When
*  Sandevol and Maddox were bartenders in love, they published a book with a co-author called
*  Fancy AF Cocktails, and were hired to mix drinks in sponsored videos for brands like AlkaSulcer.
*  Since their breakup, their fates have diverged. She is the betrayed woman,
*  courageously rebuilding her life, while he is the villain, endlessly atoning for his sins.
*  In December, Maddox released a new book, single AF Cocktails, and scheduled events with
*  live nation, an evening for bad bitches to promote it. Playing all of this up riles the fans and
*  keeps the machine turning. When Maddox said at BravoCon that she still hadn't gotten a meaningful
*  apology from Sandevol, and the audience erupted in applause, it reminded me of professional wrestling.
*  You know when the face and the heel talk smack to each other to drive crowds wild, it felt like that,
*  except that I'm pretty sure that Sandevol is not pretending. Pro wrestling has always been staged,
*  and the audience knew it but didn't care, but Vanderpump is sort of the opposite. While fans on
*  some level expect reality TV to be fake and think of Sandevol as just another TV character,
*  it's all very real to him, leaving him trapped inside these storylines indefinitely.
*  Tom Sandevol is Tom Sandevol in Tom Sandevol's life, Basque and told me, adding,
*  someone might say he is putting on a performance, but he is the performance. His entire existence
*  becomes about processing and talking about what happened. Appearing on special forces was part
*  of Sandevol's attempt at a redemption narrative. When we drove to West Hollywood that first night,
*  his Mercedes wound its way through Laurel Canyon and emerged on Sunset Boulevard, not far from the
*  huge billboard that showed him commando crawling across a rope suspended high above the ground.
*  These are the perverse economics of being a reality TV star. If it weren't for Scandevol,
*  Sandevol said, I could have probably gotten on that show, but I wouldn't have been on the billboards.
*  Contestants on special forces were reportedly paid several hundred thousand dollars,
*  but for the most part, Sandevol hasn't been able to capitalize on Scandevol as much as he would like.
*  There are minimal brands that want to be associated with someone who's thought of as a cheater.
*  Sandevol's manager, Ryan Revol, told me. This winter, Sandevol was hoping to do a residency
*  at Chippendales in Las Vegas, but talks stalled. Sandevol was disappointed. I'm in really good shape
*  right now. He said, adding, it's frustrating because, you know, everybody cashed in,
*  everybody won on this, the cast, the execs, the network, everybody made so much money.
*  But I try to put it on myself to make the best opportunity out of it that I can.
*  We pulled up to Tom Tom, a bar in restaurant that Sandevol has invested in, and that is part of
*  the Vanderpump universe, along with Sir, Schwartz and Sandeys, Jackson's Studio City, and something
*  about her, a forthcoming sandwich shop that Maddox is opening with another cast member.
*  For the fans, this landscape is like a Disney world populated by their favorite characters.
*  When I stopped by Sir in August, the food was terrible, but there was a line of people out the
*  door and around the block. No matter what part of the restaurant you sat in, you had a view of
*  cameras filming the cast, which seemed to be the point. At Tom Tom, Sandevol gave me an insider's tour.
*  There's the men's room, women's room, he said. This table is really cool, but you got to watch
*  your knees. He took me out back by the trash cans, where he says Maddox ripped his chain and split
*  his lip the night she found out about the affair. She beat my ass, he said. Through a representative,
*  Maddox declined a comment on the incident. She has denied tearing his necklace off in the past.
*  With the show nod in production, the place was quiet, except for a couple drinking wine in the
*  corner and two eager-looking women, one of whom eventually approached. Sorry to bother you, she said,
*  but I just wanted to say this place is awesome. We sat at a table and were soon joined by Kyle
*  Chan, a jeweler who appears on the show and is one of the few people who didn't drop Sandevol as a
*  friend. When I asked what it was like being around him last year, Chan compared it to watching
*  Game of Thrones, in which a character named Theon Greyjoy becomes psychologically broken after
*  being tortured and castrated. Sandevol likes to say that as a reality star, he has to live through
*  each event in his life three times. First, when he's living it, second, when he's taping
*  confessionals months later, and third, when it airs, and he has to answer to the fans.
*  In the real world, you would be able to heal and move on, but that's difficult to do on reality
*  show time. After season 11, Eris Chan said, you just have to relive it one more time, and then you'll be free.
*  A couple of weeks before I met with Sandevol, I visited the offices of Evolution Media in a
*  converted shipping warehouse near the Hollywood Burbank Airport. Bravo, which is owned by NBC
*  Universal, distributes Vanderpump via its cable channel and the streaming service Peacock.
*  But Evolution is the production company on the ground for Vanderpump, as well as others like
*  Real Housewives of Orange County and Botched. As Basqueen showed me around, random objects caught my
*  eye. A can of gasoline, bottles of Thumbs and Sunblock, a blown-up diagram of the female reproductive
*  system, a top-of-file cabinet, and a few moving boxes labeled Bitch! The office used to be bustling.
*  In the years leading up to and during the pandemic, streaming was at its peak, and Evolution was
*  considering leasing a third building to keep up with demand for new content. But the market had changed,
*  and people were working remotely. Now we just don't need the space, Basqueen said.
*  Bravo is one of the few cable networks that still bring in a loyal and affluent audience,
*  but even unscripted programming has not been immune to the contraction currently
*  plaguing the TV industry. In 2007, when the writers guild went on strike, networks rushed to
*  greenlight unscripted shows to plug holes in programming, leading to a reality TV boom.
*  In 2023, despite predictions otherwise, the boom never came. Networks and streamers, which already
*  had a stockpile of programming, held on to their cash, and with media companies consolidating into
*  entities like Warner Bros. Discovery, there were simply fewer buyers in the marketplace.
*  Basqueen estimated that when all is said and done, the unscripted business would be roughly
*  two-thirds of what it was. Over the years, various network executives have consistently asked
*  Basqueen for their own version of Vanderpump. Basqueen would love to find it, but it doesn't
*  necessarily exist, he told me. Not that others haven't tried. There was ease, what happens at the
*  Abbey, about the bar a few doors down from Tom Tom, and MTV's Lindsay Lohan's Beach Club,
*  about the staff at her venture in Mekonos. Each lasted exactly one season. This spring, Kulu will
*  premiere Vanderpump Villa, yet another attempt to mimic the formula, and Bravo will introduce
*  the Valley, a Vanderpump spin-off featuring some of the cast members who departed the show in 2020.
*  Basqueen told me that in some ways, he wished Scandalvol never happened. The national attention
*  made it much harder to film the show. Production always had a few onlookers, but during season 11,
*  paparazzi and fans were everywhere. While the show was filming in Lake Tahoe,
*  someone snapped a photo of the cast that whipped fans into such a frenzy that it became a plotline
*  on the show. Producers used to be strict about not breaking the fourth wall, but now they have no
*  choice but to let the outside world into the frame. It used to be that the real story was not that
*  there are people watching a TV show. Basqueen told me, but part of Tom Sandevol's real experience in
*  life right now is that he's not just facing an ex-girlfriend or a friend group upset with him.
*  He's facing the entire nation. As filming for the new season got underway, Bravo had a problem.
*  The cast had turned on Sandevol. Maddox refused to interact with him altogether. In July,
*  Basqueen and the network brought the cast into Evolution's offices for what he called a come to
*  Jesus moment, but he was no longer talking to 20-something waiters. We can still squeeze a great
*  season out of it, he said. But going forward, I don't know.
*  Levis was the only primary cast member who didn't return for season 11. Her team inquired about a
*  pay increase and floated the possibility of Levis' getting a development deal with Bravo.
*  Through a representative, Levis emphasized that mental health protections were her primary concern.
*  Then in August, after spending 90 days in the Arizona facility and changing her name from
*  Raquel, back to her birth name, Rachel, Levis appeared on Bethany Frankl's podcast.
*  Frankl is a former real housewife of New York. Last summer, she declared what she called the
*  reality reckoning, accusing Bravo and other networks of profiting off a harmful environment
*  created by their shows without properly compensating their stars. She invited others to join her
*  and teamed up with two prominent attorneys, Mark Garagos and Brian Friedman.
*  No actual lawsuits have been filed, but NBC Universal subsequently issued updated guidelines
*  for its production companies, including additional psychological support for cast members.
*  Part of Frankl's arsenal was a three-part interview with Levis, who described how she felt
*  exploited by Sandeval and Bravo for ratings without seeing a single penny.
*  Basque told me that Levis was paid $19,000 per episode for 18 episodes, and that news of the
*  affair came out after the season wrapped. Are we supposed to give her retroactive payment for
*  having a clandestine affair for eight months? He asked. Frankl would basically argue, yes.
*  As sag members went on strike in July, joining the writers, she called for reality stars to unionize,
*  so they too can collect residuals and benefit after the fact from a successful season.
*  But while everyone I talked to agreed that regulations would be a good thing,
*  no one was sure how it would work exactly. Part of the appeal of reality TV is that it's
*  relatively cheap to make, as low as $250,000 per episode, versus $2 million for scripted TV.
*  The draw for all parties involved is that its stars are often plucked from relative
*  obscurity. It's probably good for the business to have some protections. Revell, Sandeval's manager
*  told me, will it happen? I don't know, but no one is walking off set. I didn't see Sandeval for
*  about two weeks. Then, on a Monday in December, I drove to a soundstage in Burbank where he was
*  taping his next confessional interview for the show. Riley wasn't here this time. Instead,
*  we were joined by a Bravo publicist and Erica Forstad, a senior NBC universal executive.
*  My clue that this wasn't typical was when Forstad introduced herself to Sandeval.
*  You once made me a wonderful mocktail at Schwartz and Sandes, she said.
*  Sandeval was in a small dressing room, applying dabs of makeup to his forehead.
*  In front of him were three caffeinated beverages, a red bowl, an iced coffee, and a doctor pepper.
*  He sipped each intermittently. Sandeval said he was feeling depressed. He said the same thing the
*  last time I saw him. When I asked if the depression was show-related, he had said somewhat show-related,
*  just life, business stuff, it's hard.
*  Sandeval began to perform loud vocal exercises. He applied paumade to his hair,
*  combing it back with his fingers, and changed into a light blue women's suit from Zara,
*  which he said he preferred to the store's menswear. The suit looked good, but the sleeves barely
*  reached his wrists. As he emerged from the dressing room, there was something about the suit's
*  feminine cut combined with Sandeval's physique and slightly hunched posture that reminded me of
*  Heath Ledger's Joker in the scene at the hospital where he wears a nurses uniform.
*  It's hard to tell how Sandeval feels about filming the show. Sometimes he sounded down on it.
*  It has its fun moments, but for the most part, it sucks. I've been buzzed through most of it.
*  Other times, he told me he would do it for as long as he possibly could.
*  There was a point last year when he considered quitting, but he was glad he didn't. He wasn't at
*  all envious of Levis, who walked away from the cameras. Albeit not very far, as she has started her
*  own podcast, Rachel Goes Rogue. So far, the primary theme has been Scandival. Sandeval figured she
*  would be back in a season or two. What else is she going to do?
*  The evolution set where confessionals are taped is designed to look like another room in
*  Sir. There are deep purple curtains, a mirror dresser, and lots of gold and velvet.
*  Production for the new season wrapped in September, but interviews are taped for months afterward
*  to get the cast's reactions to what occurred. The showrunner began by asking Sandeval about a
*  tasting led by a water sommelier that everyone attended in August. Had Sandeval ever heard of a
*  water tasting? I have never even remotely heard of a water tasting before in my life. Sandeval said,
*  he tried again. I have never heard of or been to a water tasting, but here we are.
*  Sandeval hoped his luck would turn this season. It's probably why he agreed to speak with me in
*  the first place. When I last talked to him, he was feeling optimistic. He'd been meditating and
*  was about to go back on tour with his band. Plus, he was single now, which could be a whole new
*  storyline for him on the show. It's the first time I've ever been single as a celebrity, he told me.
*  I'm not saying I'm a favorite celebrity, but still just having some notoriety and being single,
*  it's a cool muscle to flex. Though he had come to Los Angeles to be an actor, he was proud of what
*  he became instead. Did he become the next Brad Pitt? No, but he didn't want to be that anymore anyway.
*  It turned out reality TV is where the real stakes are. Actors were just pretending, playing
*  roles. I had no respect for reality TV before Sandeval told me. And now I don't have very much
*  respect for actors. I'm like, y'all try doing this. Of course he knew it wasn't going to last forever,
*  but if he kept at it and rehabilitated his image, there could be life beyond his first show.
*  There were brand deals to be had, as well as reality spin-offs and competition shows.
*  Though if he was going to do another reality series, he would like it to be something more
*  feel good. Our show can be toxic to film, he said, and very stressful. Despite this, he was as
*  committed to it as ever and hoped it would continue for a while. As long as people are interested,
*  he told me, and we're being honest in our feels. That's what he was doing now,
*  sitting in front of the camera in a powder blue suit and sunless tanner being honest in his feels.
*  I watched him on a monitor as he peered into the lens with one eyebrows slightly raised,
*  then the camera rolled and his face lit up with a big genuine smile.
