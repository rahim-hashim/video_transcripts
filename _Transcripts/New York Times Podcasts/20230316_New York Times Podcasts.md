# France’s Battle Over Retirement
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGs9aRRDf2c)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Millions of people have taken to the streets in France to stop a government proposal that
*  would raise the retirement age to be more in line with its European neighbours.
*  We're protesting because we don't want to spend the rest of our life just working without
*  retirement.
*  It's a democratic problem.
*  Today, as the French parliament votes on the proposal, Paris bureau chief Roger Cohen
*  explains why it hit such a nerve in French society, and why French president Emmanuel
*  Macron pushed for it anyway.
*  It's Thursday, March 16th.
*  Roger, hello.
*  Hello, Sabrina.
*  So Roger, I've been watching all of these protests in France.
*  Millions of people on the street.
*  Help me understand what exactly is going on, why people are so upset.
*  Well, Sabrina, there's been an enormous degree of agitation and street protests in France
*  over the last couple of months in response to President Emmanuel Macron's push to raise
*  the retirement age in France to 64 from 62.
*  These are new pictures just coming into us this morning, the scene in the streets, just
*  massive disruption.
*  The result is that eight times in the last seven weeks, there has been tumult.
*  Now people are here once again to say no to President Emmanuel Macron's plans to raise
*  the retirement age from 62 to 64.
*  Massive numbers of people in the street, not only in Paris, but throughout France.
*  French union workers aiming to shut down critical industries across the nation, walking off
*  the job and into the streets.
*  The metro or subway is scarcely functioning.
*  Bus service is very limited.
*  You can't get a hold of the equivalent of the city bikes here.
*  They're all taken.
*  And because the garbage collection services on strike, garbage has been piling up into
*  great mountains of trash overhead height.
*  Fortunately, the weather has been cold, so the stink of it is not appalling as it might be.
*  While it's a very serious protest, the atmosphere has been on the whole fairly festive.
*  There's been very few incidents of actual violence and the two main labor unions who
*  have been organizing this have kept pretty good organizational control over what's happening.
*  So it's large numbers of people laughing a lot.
*  Poking fun at Macron, who is widely hated for what he's doing, and talking about how
*  life begins when work ends, which is a deeply held French conviction, very different from
*  the American view that life is enriched and enhanced by work.
*  Exactly, Roger.
*  I was going to say we, of course, have our retirement age at 65.
*  This idea that streets are filled with protesters because of a proposal about the retirement
*  age being 64 is pretty remarkable.
*  Tell me about the French idea of this.
*  What is it and why is it so different?
*  There's a fierce French attachment to the view that this country does not want a brutal
*  form of capitalism, that solidarity and equality are extremely important.
*  In the French national motto, of course, you have liberté, égalité, fraternité, liberty,
*  equality and fraternity or solidarity.
*  And to the French, the idea is pretty deep rooted that, okay, you work for 30 to 40 years,
*  but at that point, the state owes you your pension and that you work those years because
*  at the end of it, you will enjoy this sort of nirvana of a time when you no longer have
*  to work.
*  And the French do not see work in positive terms, the word work, le travail, it has a
*  negative connotation.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Look, Sabrina, there's a very large private sector in France that has a lot of big and
*  dynamic companies and there are many French people who work very hard and work past the
*  retirement age.
*  But a large number of French people take the view that once they retire, that's when life
*  will really kick in and the important things like friendship, love, community, playing
*  a game of pétanque or boule at sunset with a glass of pastis, traveling.
*  That is what French people consider to be real life, not work.
*  Right, so this is a longstanding thing in French society.
*  Why is all of this blowing up now?
*  Well, it's blowing up now, Sabrina, because of President Emmanuel Macron and his deeply
*  held personal convictions.
*  He burst on the scene in 2017, becoming president at the age of 39, having been the finance
*  minister and he always had the belief that French society had to work more, to grow more,
*  and that there were certain essential reforms that needed to happen.
*  So he set about notably changing the labor code in France to make hiring and firing much
*  more flexible than it had ever been.
*  He set about establishing a tech sector in France, he attracted a lot of foreign investment
*  and part of this conviction was also that ultimately the pension system in France would
*  have to change.
*  And what was the problem he was trying to solve for there, Roger?
*  The fundamental problem, Sabrina, is that people are living longer, so there are more
*  retirees as a proportion of the population.
*  Whereas you had in the early 1960s about four active workers for every retiree, that number
*  by the year 2000 had become 2.1 active workers, now it's down to 1.7.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And the projection is that it will continue to fall.
*  So huge difference and really in effect imbalance, right, in the number of workers that are supporting
*  every retiree.
*  If there is no reform to the pension system, there are various projections, but all of
*  them pretty much make clear that within a decade the pension system would be beginning
*  to pile up a considerable deficit.
*  And that's a problem because the government would have to borrow money, it would have
*  less money for other things at a time when it needs to make big investments in a whole
*  range of areas ranging from defense to energy.
*  A lot of people have suggested, well, why not raise taxes on the rich, you know, instead
*  of this measure, but Macron doesn't want to, he doesn't want to do that.
*  So Roger, what does Macron do?
*  Yeah, so pretty much from the outset, Macron sees France as a radical outlier that other
*  European countries, notably Germany, had raised the retirement age many years earlier, and
*  that this was something that had to be tackled.
*  I understand that changes can be hard.
*  He turned to this in 2019.
*  I see how decisions made can at times cause worry and opposition.
*  But do we have to give up on changing our country because of that?
*  No.
*  So Macron decides to propose a significant overhaul of the retirement system.
*  The government wants to remove 42 different pension schemes and put in place a universal
*  system for all workers.
*  Macron was looking to give more individual choice to people as to how they contributed
*  and to find ways to cut costs.
*  The needed remedy for a nation with an aging population or the beginning of the end of
*  France as we know it.
*  The reaction from the French was immediate.
*  The strike against pension reforms has become a record breaker.
*  Nothing is moving in Paris.
*  They're clogging highways, forcing landmarks to shut down.
*  They didn't like it.
*  And there were massive strikes and demonstrations.
*  And so the whole idea was mired in that when Covid arrived.
*  Macron essentially went more or less overnight from somebody deeply concerned with government
*  spending to the point of wanting this unpopular reform to somebody who put no limits at all
*  on government spending in order to get through Covid and help people through the crisis.
*  And in the midst of that, that first attempt to reform the pension system fails.
*  Got it.
*  So he fails to get it done.
*  And I think it's been on his mind for the last four years.
*  You know, it's stuck in his craw.
*  He didn't get it through.
*  He wants to get back to it.
*  But Covid goes on.
*  And then there's the small matter of his re-election, which becomes more complicated because then
*  on top of everything else, the Ukraine war breaks out two months before the election
*  and he wins the election.
*  But of course, the war has changed the dynamic in other respects.
*  So there's this double whammy, right, of Covid plus the Ukraine war.
*  And that makes the problem that Macron has seen for a long time in the French economy
*  that much more urgent, I would think.
*  Well he considers it more urgent.
*  Millions and millions of French people don't think it's urgent at all.
*  But yes, President Macron wants it and deficits were run up through the massive spending in
*  fighting Covid.
*  And Macron is determined that France transition to a green economy, that it increases defense
*  budget in order to be able to arm Ukraine and also to be in a strong position vis-à-vis
*  Russia that could be aggressive toward Western Europe over the next decade or two.
*  He's got a whole slew of priorities and then he thinks to himself, you know, we're spending
*  more and more on people who are getting older and older and it doesn't make sense just on
*  the basis of sheer mathematics and something has to be done about it.
*  And so given all this, he decides to act and a couple of months ago the bill is introduced
*  to raise the retirement age to 64 from 62.
*  This touched a nerve yet again in France and that's why we have this vote today on the
*  bill and the vote is going to be very, very close.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Roger, there's a vote today in the French Parliament.
*  What's going to happen?
*  Lay it out for me.
*  Well, nobody knows exactly what's going to happen, but the situation is the following.
*  In essence, Macron needs 289 votes to pass the bill.
*  He has 260 through his Renaissance party, so he needs another 29.
*  And the only party really prepared to give him any more support is the center-right
*  Republicans.
*  Whether they will, in fact, give him the 29 votes is unclear, but the government has been
*  pushing hard to get those votes.
*  It's gotten closer and closer as the protests have grown.
*  An expert whom I spoke to recently, Alain Duamil, said he would have put the odds of
*  it passing at 80 percent a month ago.
*  Now he put it at 60 percent.
*  So it's not a done deal.
*  It's not a done deal, yet he seems to have reasonably good chances of getting it passed,
*  right?
*  Yeah, he has reasonably good chances.
*  And if at the last minute, before voting begins, he decides that no, the votes aren't
*  there, there is an option under the Constitution to push this through with out of vote.
*  But the price of that, the political price, would be enormous.
*  The confrontation in France, which is already intense, would, I think, become explosive.
*  What would it mean if the overhaul did go through?
*  Like this thing that clearly many, many French people hate.
*  Well, most fundamentally, if the bill passes, it becomes the law of the country.
*  This does not mean at all that everything is going to quiet down overnight.
*  But Macron's main concern will be with his legacy.
*  This will be an important part of his legacy.
*  He thinks it's very important for France.
*  But he also knows that Marine Le Pen, the far right leader, has criticized him heavily
*  for wanting to, quote, torture French people and deny them the promised pleasures of retirement.
*  So she will use this in the years ahead to lambast Macron and try and build her support.
*  And what Macron fears most of all, according to people I've talked to, is that he might be
*  succeeded by Marine Le Pen because if Le Pen does come to power and the far right comes to
*  power in France, Macron will be remembered quite substantially as the last president before
*  the far right took over in France.
*  And he doesn't want to be remembered for that.
*  Roger, what would happen if this doesn't pass?
*  Like, if the protesters basically win and the retirement age stays the same at 62?
*  Well, it would be an acute embarrassment to the government, to the prime minister,
*  Elizabeth Bourne, and to the president, to Emmanuel Macron.
*  The government under the Constitution would be able to reintroduce the bill, but that's
*  time limited to about the end of the month.
*  And there's not much reason to think that if it didn't pass the first time, it would the
*  second. I think it would be quite plausible for the government to determine that it was no
*  longer in a position to govern as its policy had been rejected on such a fundamental matter.
*  And you could get a vote of censure in the parliament that brings down the government and
*  leads to new parliamentary elections.
*  So to sum up, the country would be in uncharted waters with a number of unpredictable
*  outcomes.
*  So, Roger, I'm thinking here of France in relation to other high income countries like its
*  neighbors in Europe, and they're all facing the same set of demographic facts, right?
*  Longer lifespans, fewer children, which leads to a real imbalance in their pension systems.
*  But with France, and I mean the opponents of raising the retirement age in France, it kind of
*  seems like they're just defying the laws of economic gravity.
*  Neighboring countries have already succumbed to them, but not France.
*  Well, France has the most elaborate social security, social protection system in the
*  world, probably when it comes to health care, when it comes to unemployment benefits, when it
*  comes to retirement.
*  And France is, although it's grown somewhat more unequal, it hasn't grown exponentially more
*  unequal as in, say, the United States and Britain over the last couple of decades.
*  And the French think there's still a choice.
*  They think the kind of capitalism that they see in the United States or some other countries,
*  that is not what they want.
*  They want to preserve their system.
*  But I think, you know, this is a state-backed system and the French feel that the state
*  should look after them.
*  You're not going to hear French people talking about rugged individualism.
*  Rugged individualism?
*  Forget about it.
*  Yeah, in some ways, you know, listening to you talk about the French system as an American,
*  I'm kind of jealous.
*  Well, as an American in France, I'm enjoying it.
*  But the number of times in France you encounter the phrase non, c'est pas possible.
*  No, impossible.
*  You know, American can do.
*  French, non, c'est pas possible.
*  And I think that goes to President Macron's fundamental point.
*  Last year, he said, what we're facing here is a choice of society.
*  And what I think he meant by that is that in order to remain strong, France has to make
*  the investments I've talked about and that France has to work those two years longer.
*  And that this is necessary for a strong Europe in a world that is looking pretty
*  combustible, menacing, intensely competitive going forward.
*  He believes that this is a form that is essential for France to remain strong, to be
*  dynamic and to adjust to the new realities of life.
*  The alternative for France does look as if it could be one where the country is clinging
*  to something from a bygone era at the cost of its vitality and dynamism.
*  Roger, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  Early Thursday morning, Credit Suisse said it would take an emergency loan from the Swiss
*  Central Bank after fighting for its life on Wednesday when investors dumped its stock
*  over concerns about its financial health.
*  The bank said it would borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs or about 54 billion dollars to
*  shore up its finances.
*  Unlike Silicon Valley Bank, a regional bank in the US that collapsed last week, Credit
*  Suisse is considered systemically important in the global financial system.
*  Its troubles on Wednesday spooked investors, prompting a wider sell off in bank stocks.
