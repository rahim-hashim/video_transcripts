*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavrini-C, and this is the Daily.
*  Last week, we told the story of Golan, a father of four whose kibbutz was attacked by Hamas
*  terrorists.
*  It was an attack that killed 1,300 Israelis and prompted Israel's government to say
*  it will now destroy Hamas, which governs Gaza and its 2 million residents.
*  Now, we turn to what's happened inside Gaza in the days since that attack.
*  Israel has prohibited food, water, and electricity from entering the territory, and has bombarded
*  it with air strikes that have killed more than 2,600 Palestinians.
*  It last week, the situation grew more dire when Israel ordered people in the north of Gaza,
*  nearly half the population, to evacuate to the south ahead of an expected Israeli ground
*  invasion.
*  Many in Gaza now fear that this mass expulsion will become permanent, reopening the trauma
*  of Israel's creation in 1948, which displaced more than 700,000 Palestinians.
*  Today, conversations with two people in Gaza about what they've experienced so far and
*  what they expect comes next.
*  It's Monday, October 16th.
*  Hi, is this Abdallah?
*  Hi, Abdallah.
*  My name is Sabrina Taverni.
*  I spoke to Abdallah Hassanin on Thursday.
*  He's 23 years old and lives in southern Gaza, in a town called Rafa.
*  At that point, people there had endured six straight days of air strikes.
*  Basically, I don't know if I'm going to be alive for the next hours or no.
*  My neighbors who are living just two blocks away from my house are evacuating at this
*  moment as they have received a threat that their whole building is going to be bombed within
*  a few minutes.
*  So, basically, it's a three-story building or four-story building.
*  When one building is threatened to be bombed, the whole block has to evacuate because it's
*  a mass destruction to the whole area.
*  The whole block that is next to my home is evacuating at this moment as I'm talking
*  to you.
*  The whole block next to your home is being evacuated right now.
*  Are you seeing that out your window?
*  I'm just seeing people running.
*  Actually, there's no light as the electricity is cut off since yesterday.
*  And I have already been facing difficulty just connecting to a stable internet connection.
*  To make this call with you.
*  Where in the house am I reaching you right now?
*  Where is safest?
*  I don't know where safest.
*  There's no safest.
*  I'm just standing here and the balcony just to make this call.
*  No place is safe enough in Gaza.
*  You're just seeing the options and which is somehow safer for you.
*  And just the whole street is in darkness.
*  And I'm just seeing people running everywhere to seek shelter at this moment.
*  Abdullah, how are you feeling right now?
*  Just feeling terrified of my family.
*  Most of them are children actually.
*  But I am the biggest one of them.
*  I'm the biggest brother.
*  And that said, I feel the responsibility to make them safe despite the fact that there's
*  no safe area in the Gaza Strip.
*  I'm sure you can hear the noise from the neighbors just running.
*  I don't know if you can hear that.
*  I hear the voices.
*  What is, what's happening downstairs?
*  Actually, you're just seeing people running at this moment seeking shelter in other safer place.
*  That's just away from the building that is threatened to be bombed.
*  All people are just seeking shelter.
*  I hear them.
*  Yeah, that's what's happening at this moment.
*  Yeah, don't worry man.
*  Mastery, luggage.
*  Come on.
*  So actually, my neighbor is telling me to open all the windows and to say away from them as they are going to bomb soon.
*  I don't know if you can hear him calling my neighbor now.
*  And why was he saying that to you?
*  Because when the air strike happens, if the windows are not open, they will break into your heads.
*  So you have to open the windows because the strength of the bombing can break the windows.
*  And you have to say from them not to be injured from the class.
*  Do you need to go open the windows right now?
*  Actually, we have already done that since the beginning of this escalation again as Gaza because we know what would happen.
*  Abdullah, do you have plans to evacuate with your family?
*  What are you thinking right now in terms of what you want to try to do?
*  So evacuate where?
*  Where should we go?
*  Because the Gaza Strip, okay, so let me tell you in Gaza, we have no shelters, we have no, no, save places.
*  Can you hear this?
*  I can hear it.
*  I can hear it.
*  What are you seeing?
*  What is that?
*  It's a rocket.
*  It's a sat-dominor strike that happens out of nowhere.
*  Did it hit something?
*  Yeah, yeah, it's not that close.
*  I've just seen the red light.
*  I'm the sound of watercrafts all over the place.
*  The same as the sound of drones that never stop.
*  But yeah, the situation is getting worse by each hour passing.
*  So I don't know if I'm going to stay this night and my heart will leave.
*  Uh-huh.
*  That's a lash-ha-brainer.
*  That's the call to prayer.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you need to pray?
*  Are you going to pray?
*  I'm going to pray after we are done with this call.
*  What will you pray?
*  What is your prayer?
*  It's kind of a spiritual connection between us and God.
*  Actually, that's the only thing that helps us at this moment.
*  I believe that the people of Gaza are left alone.
*  I'll pray for my people to get what they want to live in peace because we deserve peace.
*  So Abdelah, I wanted to ask you, we've been talking about all of the air strikes that have been happening since last Saturday.
*  And of course, the thing that happened last Saturday as well was this very deadly attack by Hamas on Israel.
*  How do you understand that attack?
*  What did you think of that?
*  Okay.
*  So it did not start actually by Hamas attack.
*  Because we've been under siege for more than 70 years.
*  And you cannot just put people into prison, deprive them from their fundamental rights, and then see nothing in response.
*  You cannot dehumanize people and expect nothing.
*  What do you think about Hamas Abdelah?
*  What it is? What it does?
*  Like I am the Hamas.
*  And I was never a big fan of Hamas.
*  We both are different in the ideology.
*  But what's happening here is not ever Hamas at all.
*  What's it about?
*  It's about ethnic cleansing of Palestinian people.
*  It's about 2.3 million of Palestinian people.
*  That's why Israel, the first thing that it did was cutting off water and cutting off electricity and cutting off food.
*  So this is not never about Hamas.
*  It's about our mistake to be born Palestinians.
*  That's it.
*  Thank you for talking to us, Abdelah.
*  And I wonder if I can call you back tomorrow.
*  I want to keep in touch and make sure you're okay.
*  And if you can, send me a voicemail, okay?
*  You hear something in the night, you send a voicemail.
*  Okay.
*  We start with breaking news on the Israel Gaza War.
*  Last night Israel told more than a million Palestinians in northern Gaza to move south.
*  Signaling a ground assault is likely coming.
*  And even if those people are able to move south, there is currently no way out of Gaza because the border crossing in the Egypt is blocked.
*  The order to evacuate the north of Gaza to the south of Gaza is just crazy.
*  It got a beat, because Israel wants to expel more Palestinians from their homes within 24 hours than it did during the whole Nakhba.
*  Of 1948, you are talking about more than 1.1 million of Palestinian people that have to evacuate within one day, within 24 hours.
*  Like, are you serious?
*  It's got to be a joke.
*  Those are really human beings.
*  These are not just numbers. We are talking about human beings.
*  This has to stop the collective punishment that we are facing every minute has to stop.
*  Hello?
*  Abdullah?
*  Yeah, I saw you.
*  Hi. How are you doing?
*  Not good at all.
*  What's happening?
*  I'm just so devastated by the news on reading.
*  Abdullah, it's Friday night at about 9.30 pm.
*  What are you going to be doing tonight?
*  What's the next couple of hours look like for you?
*  Actually, we have my aunt and my cousins coming to our home because they are evacuating as well.
*  I will be spending the night with them.
*  Actually, during escalations,
*  this is something that most of people in Gaza do.
*  They all gather in one room and they stay together all the night or they sleep together in case that they are building a stop-on that they will die together.
*  So that they die together?
*  Yeah.
*  So tonight you will sleep with your family together?
*  Yeah, that's it. That's what we do.
*  Somehow it consoles you that you have some company.
*  It sounds very dark, Abdullah.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  That's the situation here.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Hello.
*  Hi. My name is Sabrina Tavernici.
*  I'm a reporter from the New York Times and a host of the Daily Podcast.
*  What's your name?
*  My name is Wafa El-Saka.
*  And I'm from Florida.
*  I was a teacher until March of this year.
*  I was an art teacher at Hartstilts Elementary School and I live in Telahasif, Florida.
*  I spoke with Wafa El-Saka on Saturday.
*  She's a Palestinian-American and she's one of the hundreds of thousands of people who evacuated from the north of Gaza to the south over the last two days.
*  I came to visit my family because I have my mother and I was really old.
*  She's a 97 years old, found it's a bad came to visit her and take care of her.
*  And I have a father who is really ill and sick on oxygen 24-7.
*  And I just wanted to spend some time with them before, you know, so no one else is in again.
*  And this has happened.
*  And now I don't know.
*  I was almost struck by a missile yesterday morning.
*  I promised my sister no one to take care of her mom.
*  And while I was giving her the medicine and the bed, I saw a missile just passing by.
*  And I went to the room, hit the land right across from their house.
*  Everything was collapsing like, you know, the windows, the glass everywhere.
*  So I threw myself on my mother and I wanted to cover her from the debris because I was scared that she had to die.
*  Where were you, Wafa?
*  In the Gaza city, the heart of the Gaza city, El Remel.
*  El Remel is in the north, right across from the Saraya.
*  Wafa, on Friday night, the Israeli military gave the order for everybody in Northern Gaza to evacuate to the south.
*  Did you get that order?
*  No, I didn't.
*  I heard it from my niece and I'm like, no, this is just lying.
*  I'm not going to grab a gun.
*  I'm not going to grab a gun.
*  So in my mind, I kept on trying to convince my sister no one, her daughter, no, this is not true.
*  And then she gets on her phone that whatever the general of the fence from Israel saying clear it or else.
*  And she's from the previous words that she's seen.
*  And she's like, I'm not going to do it.
*  So they start like frantically picking up stuff out of nowhere.
*  Water, food, this, that.
*  And it's like, we have to evacuate.
*  We have to go.
*  Everybody's, it wins like at six o'clock.
*  No, even five-faire.
*  They start picking up all the water because we bought a lot of water because there is no water in the city.
*  Like when you open the faucet, there is no water.
*  We got tons of bread from the bakery.
*  It was a panic mode.
*  And they said wait until the daytime comes because if the Israeli see that there is movement down the stairs and near the cars, they might hit us with the metal.
*  I'm like, this is bullshit.
*  No, don't say that.
*  No, I'm going to go take the stuff and load them in the car for you guys.
*  And she goes, no, no.
*  And she helps me back and it's like, please, please don't go down.
*  They will kill you. They will hit a missile on you.
*  So your sister-in-law was worried that if you went downstairs and brought the food and supplies to the car, you could get hit with something from the Israeli side.
*  Yeah, because they will see movement.
*  And then I was panicking and I said, I can't do panic because I need to start waiting and think I'm not going to go with them.
*  The embassy already assured me evacuation very soon.
*  And then they said, no, you have to come with us. I said, no, I'm not going to go.
*  This is not safe. What are you guys doing?
*  So what happened then? What happened? Did you go with your relatives? What did you do?
*  No, they are really left.
*  So after like about two hours, that missile had.
*  And it was just right across the street. It was just a within couple of feet of the house.
*  It was like a huge sound with a fire coming next to the window.
*  The sound is unbearable.
*  Like if you ever heard the worst thunder ever, but it's multiplied by hundreds of times of that sound.
*  Like it will make you death.
*  And then all debris all around me and like dust and gas.
*  There was a smelly smell. I can't describe the smell yet.
*  But it burned the throat and my like my nose and my eyes.
*  I never ever smell something like it.
*  And then my brother and little holds the neighbor next to us and we took my mother and little downstairs.
*  And we got my nephew to come back with the car and evacuate us.
*  And we came to Hanunas.
*  And it was like cars after cars with people hanging from the side of the car.
*  And they were holding to the window.
*  But from the outside, kids like ten years old and eight years old.
*  Their mother holding their hands inside the car and they're hanging from outside the car.
*  Because the car is loaded with tin 15 and stuff.
*  Ten people in a car.
*  More.
*  There is some of them with more.
*  I'm telling you, people were hanging out, some people opening the trunk of the car and having kids inside the trunk with the trunk open.
*  I even saw those construction.
*  I lost the English.
*  You know, the one moves the rubber like a bulldozer like a digger.
*  Yes.
*  And having mattresses in there and they have in people sitting on the mattress in that bulldozer holding them.
*  Oh my god.
*  So kids were actually hanging on from the outside of cars, hanging on to people from the inside of the car.
*  The trunks were open.
*  People were stuffed into the trunks.
*  I was like, I'm going to take pictures of you.
*  Yes.
*  I didn't have the heart to take pictures.
*  I wish I did, but I couldn't.
*  I couldn't because I wasn't this believe my heart was aching.
*  I felt like my heart is broken to see my city.
*  This is unreal.
*  Oh my god.
*  That was so.
*  It was a red light on top of that.
*  It was.
*  It was like a sun shine and then it dropped.
*  What does that mean?
*  There was a missile hit close by, but it felt like it was in here, but I could see like a sun coming over and then went down.
*  Wafa, you were on the road.
*  What happened once you got to Hun Unis?
*  Did you know anybody there to go into their house?
*  What happened?
*  No, I never been to this house before, but my husband niece, it's her, the uncle of her husband, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  So it's like a far away relationship.
*  Yeah.
*  I never met them before.
*  So we call.
*  That's another sunshine came over.
*  And there's another one.
*  And the smell.
*  I can't describe the smell.
*  It's like.
*  You know, like matches like matches, but very strong, like very strong comes to your throat.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like it burns the back of your throat.
*  Yeah, that sulfur taste.
*  And your eyes and the nose.
*  Does the house shake?
*  What does it feel like?
*  Yes, like it's a little earthy, quickie.
*  Yes.
*  Waffa, so you came to this house where you've never been before.
*  Have you met the owners?
*  Are they feeding you?
*  What's happening in the house?
*  We brought in lots of food and they have some too.
*  But then you don't feel like eating when you see an old thing.
*  You know, but we have kids and we have to feed them.
*  And they're so crying all day long.
*  They crying.
*  They're being asked in the parents.
*  They want to go home.
*  They are tired of this.
*  How many kids are you with?
*  We have about 10, 10 litre kids.
*  But we have about 70 people around here.
*  70, 70.
*  Don't hear me.
*  Oh my god.
*  Another one.
*  Another one.
*  And I have another one.
*  So what happened?
*  You arrived to the house.
*  You were staying with.
*  Yeah.
*  I came into your.
*  I stayed.
*  And then I felt uncomfortable since I don't know them.
*  So I called a friend of mine.
*  And she has her cousin lives in Han Unis.
*  So I went there with them, which was yesterday, Friday.
*  We ate little sandwiches of cheese and zatter and a couple of teas.
*  And then I said, I haven't slept for a week.
*  So they gave me a mattress on one of the rooms.
*  So I slept.
*  I actually went into a deep sleep in 5-15 almost.
*  A huge, orific, waky sound would things come in the through the window and then screams of this young little,
*  the little girl coming out of their mattresses like popcorn, freaking out.
*  What the hell is this?
*  Did I go to hell or something?
*  I jumped out and started grabbing those girls who are 15 and 13, freaking out, shaking.
*  And I'm like, we're okay.
*  We're okay.
*  We're okay.
*  What happened is they hit a missile.
*  Three houses away from the house I stayed at in the middle of the town of Han Unis.
*  But they hit it with no warning with people inside.
*  So the men who were staying with us, they rushed to hell with the people because they said there were tons of people over 30 plus people in there.
*  They found the older lady.
*  They picked her up.
*  She came in so dusty, full of dust everywhere.
*  She can't breathe.
*  So they start washing their face.
*  They were describing that there were little girls dead everywhere.
*  And there was next to the house like a store for weddings.
*  So they start grabbing from those wedding dresses and party dresses and covering their bodies.
*  Oh my god, another one.
*  Another one.
*  If you like the sun comes so fast and goes down, you know, but with the noise and the smell.
*  Like a super fast sunrise and sunset.
*  That's so yeah, you could hear it, right?
*  Yeah, I could hear it.
*  I could hear it.
*  I hear it.
*  In this attack, you're describing.
*  You said they were grabbing wedding dresses and party dresses.
*  To cover the girls who are dead because their bodies are like showing.
*  And they went and they found body parts, the legs of kids and arms and body parts over the place.
*  You wafa just remind me here, you're in the south at the south of the long, right?
*  This was the place you were told to evacuate and you're getting hit.
*  And this is a safer place, the supposedly for us.
*  How is your mother-in-law? Is she still there with you?
*  She's with us right here, but she's not doing well.
*  Every movement, like you just tried to touch her hair, she screamed.
*  You move her arms, she screamed.
*  We're all scared that we're going to lose her at any time.
*  And we don't have hospitals to take her to.
*  We don't have any place to.
*  We're just trying to make her comfortable and we don't even have the enough medication to do so.
*  Where is your father and where is your husband?
*  My husband is in Tauha, Switzerland.
*  With my other son, I have two boys.
*  My grandson is crying every day, selling me, please, grandma, come back.
*  And I keep in the promise in them, I'll be there.
*  I'll break it in my heart that I came in here and left it behind.
*  So...
*  My father is in his house, used to evacuate, because he said with the oxygen and his health, and with the dust and the bombing he said, I can't.
*  And if I die, he didn't have the end of it.
*  My two brothers would not leave him alone in his bed with him.
*  And my mom left with my sister alone somewhere here in Hanun, that I don't know even the other, or I don't even know where she is.
*  Is he in the north, your father?
*  Yes, he is still in the north side.
*  Oh, I lived in the state for a long time.
*  For over 35 years.
*  And now I retired, so I kind of try to come back and spend some time with him, because I lost a lot of time with him.
*  So I'm trying to make up for it.
*  Okay, let's take care of it.
*  I don't know, I'm so tired of this, why we can't see our family calmly and kindly without being hurt.
*  My sister was her house, and her two kids' house, all three houses was, and she's somewhere with some people, I don't even know where.
*  My mother evacuated with my sister, and my dad cannot leave because he has the oxygen tank in our house in the little, in the room.
*  So I don't know, and we are in some people's house, I don't even know.
*  Like, I have to see them.
*  I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what else to do.
*  Everybody's everywhere, I don't know.
*  Oh, my goodness, oh, my goodness.
*  Another one.
*  What do you think will happen?
*  What I think will happen.
*  Yes.
*  I think a lot of killing.
*  We lived in 1948, and all we're asking is to have a peace to raise our kids.
*  You already took our land, you already took our home, you already took our grandparents and parents and lots of killing happened.
*  So why?
*  What do they want?
*  They want Gaza?
*  What are they going to do with us?
*  What are they going to do with the people?
*  I want this question to be answered, so we know.
*  They want to throw us to the sea.
*  God has to do it.
*  Don't keep us in pain.
*  Just do it.
*  But they cut in the electricity.
*  They're limiting the food that's coming in.
*  They're limiting the gas.
*  They're limiting everything.
*  Everything is controlled by them.
*  They're limiting blood coming in for God's sake.
*  Before I used to say Gaza is an open prison, now I say Gaza is an open grave.
*  It's a grave.
*  You think people alive?
*  They are zombie.
*  They are not alive.
*  They are not alive.
*  Not just because they walk and talking.
*  That means they are alive?
*  They are not.
*  They are all traumatized.
*  They are all traumatized.
*  I'm a traumatized.
*  And I know how to heal myself trying to.
*  But I can't heal my heart anymore after this war.
*  My heart is broken to the bone.
*  On Saturday, Wafa got word that foreign citizens were to go to the border crossing between Gaza and Egypt.
*  She said she went and waited for hours with hundreds of others, but that the crossing remained shut.
*  Yesterday, US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, arrived in Egypt to discuss efforts to get Americans out through the crossing.
*  Meanwhile, the Times reports that Israel's plan to invade Gaza with tens of thousands of troops could begin as early as today.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  The US House of Representatives entered its third week without a speaker as Republicans engaged in a prolonged public fight over who should lead the chamber.
*  On Friday, Republicans nominated Representative Jim Jim.
*  Following the withdrawal of their previous nominee, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana.
*  But it does not appear that Jordan, a hard-right conservative, has enough support to clinch the job in a vote on the House floor.
*  So over the weekend, Jordan's supporters tried to browbeat fellow Republicans to fight for the fight.
*  But it does not appear that Jordan, a hard-right conservative, has enough support to clinch the job in a vote on the House floor.
*  Now-beat fellow Republicans into supporting him, posting the phone numbers of holdouts and encouraging conservative voters to flood their offices with calls demanding that they back Jordan.
