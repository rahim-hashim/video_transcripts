# Voices from Gaza
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsxlKjSsIUk)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Last week, we told the story of Golan, a father of four whose kibbutz was attacked by Hamas
*  terrorists.
*  It was an attack that killed 1,300 Israelis and prompted Israel's government to say it
*  will now destroy Hamas, which governs Gaza and its two million residents.
*  Now we turn to what's happened inside Gaza in the days since that attack.
*  Israel has prohibited food, water and electricity from entering the territory and has bombarded
*  it with airstrikes that have killed more than 2,600 Palestinians.
*  Late last week, the situation grew more dire when Israel ordered people in the north of
*  Gaza, nearly half the population, to evacuate to the south ahead of an expected Israeli
*  ground invasion.
*  Many in Gaza now fear that this mass expulsion will become permanent, reopening the trauma
*  of Israel's creation in 1948, which displaced more than 700,000 Palestinians.
*  Today, conversations with two people in Gaza about what they've experienced so far and
*  what they expect comes next.
*  It's Monday, October 16th.
*  Hello.
*  Hi, is this Abdullah?
*  Yeah.
*  Hi, Abdullah.
*  My name is Sabrina Tavernisi.
*  I spoke to Abdullah Hassaneen on Thursday.
*  He's 23 years old and lives in southern Gaza in a town called Rafa.
*  At that point, people there had endured six straight days of airstrikes.
*  Basically, I don't know if I'm going to be alive for the next hours or no.
*  My neighbors who are living just two blocks away from my house are evacuating at this
*  moment as they have received a threat that their whole building is going to be bombed
*  within a few minutes.
*  Basically, it's a three-story building or four-story building.
*  When one building is threatened to be bombed, the whole block has to evacuate because it's
*  a mass destruction to the whole area.
*  So the whole block that is next to my home is evacuating at this moment as I'm talking
*  to you.
*  The whole block next to your home is being evacuated right now.
*  Are you seeing that out your window?
*  I'm just seeing people running.
*  Actually, there's no light as the electricity has cut off since yesterday.
*  I have already been facing difficulty just connecting to a stable internet connection
*  to make this call with you.
*  Where in the house am I reaching you right now?
*  Where is safest?
*  I don't know where is safest.
*  There's no safest.
*  I'm just standing here in the balcony just to make this call.
*  No place is safe enough in Gaza.
*  You're just seeing the options and which is somehow safer for you.
*  Just the whole street is in darkness.
*  I just see people running everywhere to seek shelter at this moment.
*  Abdullah, how are you feeling right now?
*  Just feeling terrified about my family.
*  Most of them are children actually.
*  I am the biggest one of them.
*  I'm the biggest brother.
*  And that's it.
*  I feel the responsibility to make them safe despite the fact that there is no safe area
*  in the Gaza Strip.
*  I'm sure you can hear the noise from the neighbors just running.
*  I don't know if you can hear that.
*  I hear the voices.
*  What is happening downstairs?
*  Actually, you're just seeing people running at this moment seeking shelter in other safer
*  place that's just away from the building that is threatened to be bombed.
*  Whole people are just seeking shelter.
*  I hear them.
*  Yeah, that's what's happening at this moment.
*  Yeah, don't worry, man.
*  So actually, my neighbor is telling me to open all the windows and to stay away from
*  them as they are going to bomb soon.
*  I don't know if you can hear him calling my name or not.
*  And why was he saying that to you?
*  Because when the airstrike happens, if the windows are not open, they will break into
*  your heads.
*  So you have to open the windows because the strength of the bombing can break the windows
*  and you have to stay from them not to be injured from the class.
*  Do you need to go open the windows right now?
*  Actually, we have already done that since the beginning of this escalation against Gaza
*  because we know what would happen.
*  Abdullah, do you have plans to evacuate with your family?
*  What are you thinking right now in terms of what you want to try to do?
*  So evacuate where?
*  Where should we go?
*  Because the Gaza Strip.
*  OK, so let me tell you, in Gaza, we have no shelters.
*  We have no safe places.
*  Can you hear this?
*  I can hear it.
*  I can hear it.
*  What are you seeing?
*  What is that?
*  It's a rocket.
*  It's a damn airstrike that happens out of nowhere.
*  Did it hit something?
*  Yeah, but it's not that close.
*  I've just seen the red light.
*  And the sound of aircrafts is all over the place, the same as the sound of drones that
*  never stop.
*  But yeah, the situation is getting worse by each hour passing.
*  So I don't know if I'm going to stay this night and my heart will leave.
*  Uh-huh.
*  It's Al-Asha prayer.
*  That's the call to prayer.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you need to pray?
*  Are you going to pray?
*  I'm going to pray after we are done with this call.
*  What will you pray?
*  What is your prayer?
*  It's kind of a spiritual connection between us and God.
*  And actually, that's the only thing that helps us at this moment as we are left.
*  I believe that the people of Gaza are left alone.
*  I'll pray for my people to get what they want to live in peace because we deserve peace.
*  So Abdullah, I wanted to ask you, we've been talking about all of the airstrikes that have
*  been happening since last Saturday.
*  And of course, the thing that happened last Saturday as well was this very deadly attack
*  by Hamas on Israel.
*  How do you understand that attack?
*  What did you think of that?
*  Okay.
*  So it did not start actually by Hamas attack because we've been under siege for more than
*  70 years.
*  And you cannot just put people into prison, deprive them from their fundamental rights,
*  and then see nothing in response.
*  You cannot dehumanize people and expect nothing.
*  What do you think about Hamas, Abdullah?
*  What it is?
*  What it does?
*  Like I am not Hamas.
*  And I was never a big fan of Hamas.
*  We both are different in the ideology.
*  So what's happening here is not about Hamas at all.
*  What's it about?
*  It's about it's about ethnic cleansing of Palestinian people.
*  It's about 2.3 million of Palestinian people.
*  That's why Israel, the first thing that it did was cutting off water and cutting off
*  electricity and cutting off food.
*  So this is not never about Hamas.
*  It's about our mistake to be born Palestinians.
*  That's it.
*  Thank you for talking to us, Abdullah.
*  And I wonder if I can call you back tomorrow.
*  I want to keep in touch and make sure you're okay.
*  And if you can send me a voice memo, okay?
*  You hear something in the night, you send a voice memo.
*  Okay.
*  We start with breaking news on the Israel-Gaza war.
*  Last night Israel told more than a million Palestinians in northern Gaza to move south,
*  signaling a ground assault is likely coming.
*  And even if those people are able to move south, there is currently no way out of Gaza
*  because the border crossing into Egypt is blocked.
*  The order to evacuate the north of Gaza to the south of Gaza is just crazy.
*  And it got to be a joke because Israel wants to expel more Palestinians from their homes
*  within 24 hours than it did during the whole Nakba of 1948.
*  You are talking about more than 1.1 million of Palestinian people that have to evacuate
*  within one day, within 24 hours?
*  Like are you serious?
*  It's got to be a joke.
*  Those are really human beings.
*  These are not just numbers.
*  We are talking about human beings.
*  This has to stop.
*  The collective punishment that we are facing every minute has to stop.
*  Welcome to Ain fiasys.
*  Yeah. Hi, Safin.
*  Hi. How are you doing?
*  Not good at all.
*  What's happening?
*  I'm just so devastated by the news I'm reading.
*  Abdullah, it's Friday night at about...
*  Nine.
*  Nine-thirty p.m.
*  What are you going to be doing tonight?
*  What's the next couple of hours look like for you?
*  So actually we have my aunt and my cousins coming to our home
*  because they are evacuating as well.
*  So I will be spending the night with them.
*  Actually, during escalations, this is something that most of people in Gaza do.
*  They all gather in one room and they stay together all the night.
*  Or they sleep together.
*  In case that their building is the bomb, that they will die together.
*  So that they die together.
*  Yeah.
*  So tonight you'll sleep with your family together.
*  Yeah, that's it. That's what we do.
*  Somehow it consoles you that you have some camping.
*  It sounds very dark, Abdullah.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  That's the situation here.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Hello?
*  Hi.
*  My name is Sabrina Tavernisi.
*  I'm a reporter from the New York Times and a host of The Daily Podcast.
*  What's your name?
*  My name is Wafa El-Saka and I'm from Florida.
*  I was a teacher until March of this year.
*  I was an art teacher at Hartsfield Elementary School and I live in Tallahassee, Florida.
*  I spoke with Wafa El-Saka on Saturday.
*  She's a Palestinian American and she's one of the hundreds of thousands of people who've
*  evacuated from the north of Gaza to the south over the last two days.
*  I came to visit my family because I have my mother-in-law who's really old.
*  She's a 97-year-old, founded to Beth, came to visit her and take care of her.
*  I have a father who is really ill and sick on oxygen, 24-7.
*  I just wanted to spend some time with them before, you know, don't know when I'll see
*  them again.
*  This has happened.
*  Now, I don't know.
*  I was almost struck by a missile yesterday morning.
*  I promised my sister-in-law I'll take care of her mom and while I was giving her the
*  medicine on the bed, I saw a missile just passing by next to the room, hit the land
*  right across from their house.
*  Everything collapsing, like, you know, the windows, glass everywhere.
*  So I threw myself on my mother-in-law to cover her from the debris because I was scared that
*  she could get hit in the eye, you know.
*  Where were you, Wafa?
*  In Gaza City, the heart of the Gaza City, El-Rimal.
*  El-Rimal is in the north, right across from the Saraya.
*  Wafa, on Friday night, the Israeli military gave the order for everybody in northern Gaza
*  to evacuate to the south.
*  Did you get that order?
*  No, I didn't.
*  I heard it from my niece and I'm like, no, this is just lying.
*  This is propaganda.
*  So in my mind, I kept on trying to convince, you know, my sister-in-law and her daughter,
*  no, this is not true.
*  And then she gets on her phone that whatever the general of defense from Israel saying,
*  clear it or else.
*  And she, from previous words that she seen, she said, if he says something, he'll do it.
*  So they start like frantically picking up stuff out of nowhere, water, food, this, that,
*  and it's like, we have to evacuate.
*  We have to go.
*  We have to go.
*  It went like at six o'clock.
*  It was like, no, even five thirty.
*  They start picking up all the water because we bought a lot of water because there is
*  no water in the city.
*  Like when you open the faucets, there is no water.
*  And then we got food like of cheeses and we got tons of bread from the bakery.
*  It was a panic, a mode.
*  And they said, wait until the daytime comes because if the Israelis see that there is
*  movement down the stairs and near the cars, they might hit us with a missile.
*  I'm like, this is bullshit.
*  No, don't say that.
*  No, I'm going to go take the stuff and load them in the car for you guys.
*  And she goes, and she held me back and like, please, please don't go down.
*  They will kill you.
*  They will hit a missile on you.
*  So your sister-in-law was worried that if you went downstairs and brought the food and
*  supplies to the car, you could get hit with something from the Israeli side.
*  Yes, because they will see movement.
*  And then I was panicking and I said, I can't do panic because I need to wait and think
*  I'm not going to go with them.
*  The embassy already issued me evacuation very soon.
*  And then they said, no, you have to come with us.
*  I said, no, I'm not going to go.
*  This is not safe.
*  What are you guys doing?
*  So Wafa, then what happened?
*  Did you go with your relatives?
*  What did you do?
*  No, they already left.
*  So after about two hours, that missile hit.
*  And it was just right across the street.
*  It was just within a couple of feet of the house.
*  It was like a huge sound with a fire coming next to the window.
*  The sound is unbearable.
*  Like if you ever heard the worst thunder ever, but it's multiplied by hundreds of times of
*  that sound, like it will make you deaf.
*  And then all debris is all around me and like dust and gas.
*  There was a smelly smell.
*  I can't describe the smell yet.
*  But it burned the throat and like my nose and my eyes.
*  I never, ever smelled something like it.
*  And then my brother-in-law called the neighbor next to us and we took my mother-in-law downstairs.
*  And we got my nephew to come back with the car and evacuate us.
*  And we came to Hanunis.
*  And it was like cars after cars with people hanging from the side of the car.
*  They hold into the windows, but from the outside kids, like 10 years old and eight years old,
*  their parents, their mother, like holding their hands inside the car and they're hanging
*  from outside the car because the car is loaded with 10, 15 and stuff in there.
*  Ten people in a car?
*  More.
*  There is some of them with more.
*  I'm telling you, people were hanging out.
*  Some people opening the trunk of the car and having kids inside the trunk with the trunk open.
*  Kids inside the trunk?
*  I even saw those construction.
*  I lost the in English.
*  You know, the one moves the rubble.
*  Like a bulldozer?
*  Like a digger?
*  Yeah.
*  And having mattresses in there and they having people sitting on the mattress in that bulldozer
*  holding them.
*  Oh my God.
*  So kids were actually hanging on from the outside of cars, hanging on to people from
*  the inside of the car.
*  The trunks were open.
*  People were stuffed into the trunk.
*  I promise you.
*  Yes.
*  I didn't have the heart to take pictures.
*  I wish I did, but I couldn't.
*  I couldn't because I was in disbelief.
*  My heart was aching.
*  I felt like my heart is broken to see my city.
*  This is unreal.
*  Oh my God.
*  I'm not so well.
*  Wafa?
*  There was a red light on top of the house.
*  We didn't know where it hit.
*  It went like a sunshine and then it dropped.
*  What does that mean?
*  There was a missile hit close by, but it felt like it was in here.
*  But I could see like a sun coming over and then went down.
*  Wafa, you were on the road.
*  What happened once you got to Hanunis?
*  Did you know anybody there to go into their house?
*  What happened?
*  No, I never been to this house before.
*  But my husband, niece, it's the uncle of her husband.
*  So it's like a far away relationship.
*  I never met them before.
*  So we called.
*  Then another sunshine came over.
*  And there is another one.
*  And the smell, I can't describe the smell.
*  It's like, you know, like matches, like matches, but very strong, like very strong comes to
*  your throat.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like it burns the back of your throat, that sulfur taste.
*  And your eyes and the nose.
*  Does the house shake?
*  What does it feel like?
*  Yes, like it's a little earthquakey.
*  A little earthquake.
*  Yes.
*  Wafa, so you came to this house where you've never been before.
*  Have you met the owners?
*  Are they feeding you what's happening in the house?
*  We brought in lots of food and they have some, too.
*  But then you don't feel like eating when you see all this pain.
*  But we have kids and we have to feed them.
*  And they're so crying all day long.
*  They crying.
*  They've been asking their parents, they want to go home.
*  They are tired of this.
*  How many kids are you with?
*  We have about 10, 10 little kids.
*  But we have about 70 people on here.
*  70, 7-0.
*  Don't scare me.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Another one.
*  Another one.
*  So what happened?
*  You arrived to the house.
*  You're staying with...
*  Yes, I came in here.
*  I stayed and then I felt uncomfortable since I don't know them.
*  So I called a friend of mine and she has her cousin, Lizzan Hanunis.
*  So I went there with them, which was yesterday, Friday.
*  We ate little sandwiches of cheese and zatar and a cup of tea.
*  And then I said, I haven't slept for a week.
*  So they gave me a mattress on one of the rooms when I slept.
*  I actually went into a deep sleep and 5, 15 almost.
*  A huge, earthquake-y sound with things coming through the window
*  and then screams of these young little girls coming out of their mattresses
*  like popcorn, freaking out.
*  What the hell is this?
*  Did I go to hell or something?
*  I jumped out and started grabbing those girls who are 15 and 13,
*  freaking out, shaking.
*  And I'm like, we're OK.
*  We're OK. We're OK.
*  What happened is they hit a missile three houses away from the house
*  I stayed at in the middle of the town of Hanunis.
*  But they hit it with no warning with people inside.
*  So the men who were staying with us, they rushed to help with the people
*  because they said there were tons of people, over 30 plus people in there.
*  They found the older lady.
*  They picked her up.
*  She came in so dusty, full of dust everywhere.
*  She can't breathe.
*  So they start washing her face.
*  They were describing that there were little girls dead everywhere.
*  And there was next to the house, like a store for weddings.
*  So they start grabbing from those wedding dresses and party dresses
*  and covering their bodies.
*  Oh, my God. Another one.
*  Another one.
*  It feels like the sun comes so fast and goes down, you know,
*  but with the noise and the smell like a super fast sunrise and sunset.
*  That's how. Yeah.
*  You could hear it, right?
*  Yeah, I could hear it.
*  I could hear it. I hear it.
*  In this attack, you're describing, you said they were grabbing
*  wedding dresses and party dresses to cover the girls,
*  to cover the girls who are dead because their bodies are showing.
*  And they went and they found body parts, the legs of kids,
*  arms and body parts all over the place.
*  But Wafa, just remind me here, you're in the south at the south of the line, right?
*  This was the place you were told to evacuate and you're getting hit.
*  And this is a safer place, supposedly, for us.
*  How is your mother-in-law?
*  Is she still there with you?
*  She's with us right here, but she's not doing well.
*  Every movement like you just to try to touch her hair, she screams.
*  You move her arm, she screams.
*  We're all scared that we're going to lose her at any time.
*  And we don't have hospitals to take her to.
*  We don't have any place to.
*  We're just trying to make her comfortable.
*  And we don't even have the enough medication to do so.
*  Where is your father and where is your husband?
*  My husband is in Tallahassee, Florida, with my other son.
*  I have two boys.
*  My grandson is crying every day telling me, please, grandma, come back.
*  And I keep promising him I'll be there.
*  Breaking my heart that I came in here and left behind.
*  My father is in his house to evacuate
*  because he said with the oxygen and his health and with the dust
*  and the bombing, he said I can't.
*  And if I die, then that's the end of it.
*  So my my two brothers would not leave him alone and stayed with him.
*  And my mom left with my sister-in-law somewhere here in the Hanunis
*  that I don't know even the address or I don't even know where she is.
*  Is he in the north, your father?
*  Yes, he's still in the north side.
*  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
*  Another one.
*  Um, no, I lived in the state for a long time, for over 35 years.
*  And now I retired.
*  So I kind of try to come back and spend some time with them
*  because I lost a lot of time with them.
*  So I'm trying to make up for it.
*  I just take care of them.
*  I don't know. I'm so tired of this.
*  Why we can't see our family calmly.
*  And kindly without being hurt.
*  My sister lost her house and her two kids house.
*  All three houses lost and she's somewhere with some people I don't even know where.
*  My mother evacuated with my sister-in-law into Hanunis.
*  My dad cannot leave because he has the oxygen tank
*  and he's in our house in a little in a little remel.
*  So I don't know.
*  And we are in some people's house I don't even know.
*  Like I have to stay with them.
*  And my mother-in-law is crying.
*  She wanted to go back to her bed, but we can't take her back.
*  So I don't know.
*  I don't know what else to do.
*  Everybody's everywhere.
*  I don't know. I don't know.
*  Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.
*  Another one.
*  Wafa, what do you think will happen?
*  What I think will happen? Yes.
*  I think a lot of killing.
*  We lived in 1948 and all we're asking is to have a piece to raise our kids.
*  You already took our land.
*  You already took our homes.
*  You already took our grandparents and parents and lots of killings happened.
*  Why we're repeating history again? For what?
*  What did they want? They want Gaza.
*  What are they going to do with us?
*  What are they going to do with the people?
*  I want this question to be answered so we know.
*  They want to throw us to the sea.
*  Go ahead. Do it. Don't don't keep us.
*  Don't keep us in pain. Just do it.
*  But they cut in the electricity.
*  They limiting the food that's coming in.
*  They limiting the gas. They limiting medication.
*  They limiting everything. Everything is controlled by them.
*  They limiting blood coming in for God's sake.
*  Before, I used to say Gaza is an open prison.
*  Now I say Gaza is an open grave.
*  It's a grave.
*  It's a grave.
*  You think people are like they are zombies.
*  They are not alive.
*  They are not alive. Not just because they walk and talking.
*  That means they are alive.
*  No, they are not.
*  They all traumatized.
*  They all traumatized. I'm traumatized.
*  And I know how to heal myself trying to.
*  But I can't heal my heart anymore after this war.
*  My heart is broken to the bone.
*  They mean to me that Italy is one of the world
*  with hundreds of others, but that the crossing remained shut.
*  Yesterday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Egypt to discuss efforts
*  to get Americans out through the crossing.
*  Meanwhile, the Times reports that Israel's plan to invade Gaza with tens of thousands
*  of troops could begin as early as today.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  The U.S. House of Representatives entered its third week without a speaker, as Republicans
*  engaged in a prolonged public fight over who should lead the chamber.
*  On Friday, Republicans nominated Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, following the withdrawal
*  of their previous nominee, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana.
*  But it does not appear that Jordan, a hard-right conservative, has enough support to clinch
*  the job in a vote on the House floor.
*  So over the weekend, Jordan's supporters tried to browbeat fellow Republicans into
*  supporting him, posting the phone numbers of holdouts and encouraging conservative voters
*  to flood their offices with calls demanding that they back Jordan.
