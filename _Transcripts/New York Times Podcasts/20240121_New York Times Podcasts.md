# The Sunday Read: ‘Podcasters Took Up Her Sister’s Murder Investigation. Then They Turned on Her’
**NewYorkTimesPodcasts:** [January 21, 2024](https://rr2---sn-ab5l6nrl.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?expire=1710982045&ei=PS_7ZaCSBfWM_9EPvdWgkA4&ip=128.59.179.6&id=o-ANTHwp2e0hk1a3hiY3DaS1irmWL7ZqAFrg_DEHmA4KGl&itag=139&source=youtube&requiressl=yes&xpc=EgVo2aDSNQ%3D%3D&mh=eU&mm=31%2C29&mn=sn-ab5l6nrl%2Csn-ab5sznzk&ms=au%2Crdu&mv=m&mvi=2&pl=16&initcwndbps=2192500&vprv=1&mime=audio%2Fmp4&gir=yes&clen=17868632&dur=2930.063&lmt=1705836333805095&mt=1710960092&fvip=3&keepalive=yes&c=ANDROID_EMBEDDED_PLAYER&txp=6218224&sparams=expire%2Cei%2Cip%2Cid%2Citag%2Csource%2Crequiressl%2Cxpc%2Cvprv%2Cmime%2Cgir%2Cclen%2Cdur%2Clmt&sig=AJfQdSswRAIgeICUV_WL3uFYBsbjU4qY13S5ibq3RkWTarhHg2322oICIHlffgW1zF5hmpB03AIrGStn8zvZtg7BZ0B8mtIu-1zU&lsparams=mh%2Cmm%2Cmn%2Cms%2Cmv%2Cmvi%2Cpl%2Cinitcwndbps&lsig=ALClDIEwRAIgfxIslZu7tiKOGb--VAV1hhOGcEefrqVPAHnYKA2AWaECIDB0cvipGJl9jHjrX9c9MirdmswlkokGAIOh_lMPnVgY)
*  True Crime is the oldest storytelling.
*  The cultural obsession, it's nothing new.
*  One thing that True Crime kind of excels at though is it adapts to new technology and media
*  formats really well.
*  From the printing press to podcasts and Facebook, and with this we've seen the development
*  of what some people call the True Crime Industrial Complex.
*  It's a huge business and it can also be an emotional minefield for victims' families.
*  My name's Sarah Verine and I'm a contributing writer for the New York Times magazine and
*  I used to live in Lubbock, Texas where this week's Sunday read takes place.
*  It's a piece I wrote for the magazine about a woman named Liz Flat, whose sister, Deborah
*  Sue Williamson or Debbie, was murdered almost 50 years ago when Debbie was 18 and Liz was
*  just eight.
*  My story follows Liz's efforts to solve her sister's murder and how in the process she became
*  a target of some of the very people who also wanted to see her sister's murder solved.
*  So the trouble for Liz begins in 2021.
*  Decades had passed since her sister's killing.
*  From Liz's perspective, the police weren't really making any progress on the case and
*  Liz had already tried a bunch of other avenues, appearing on podcasts, talking to journalists,
*  working with a nonprofit that focused on cold cases.
*  She was even part of a True Crime documentary on Netflix.
*  Increasingly desperate, she finds herself at CrimeCon, which is the biggest True Crime
*  conference in the United States, possibly even in the world.
*  And there she meets these two independent investigator slash podcasters.
*  One is also a journalist and the other an agent professor at a university.
*  They're interested in helping Liz solve her sister's case with crowdsourcing.
*  It's not a new idea, crowdsourcing, but it's relatively new to the world of True Crime.
*  The idea is this.
*  If you get a group of people together who are interested in solving a crime, you'll have
*  more manpower and expertise that could help you find clues and potentially identify suspects.
*  Liz agrees to let the investigators take on our sister's case and they set up a Facebook
*  page dedicated to building a community of people who would help crowdsource the case.
*  But soon it all goes completely south.
*  First Liz and the investigators argue over sensitive documents related to her sister's
*  murder and then Liz herself becomes part of the gossip of the crowdsourcing community.
*  It snowballs into a deeper disagreement over a question that I think is central to the
*  story.
*  Other times when our collective desire to solve the mystery or to catch the criminal actually
*  does more harm than good.
*  So here's my article, read by Samantha Des.
*  Our audio producer today is Adrienne Hurst.
*  The original music was written and performed by Erin Espacito.
*  Liz flat drove to Austin mostly out of desperation.
*  She had tried talking with the police.
*  She had tried working with a former FBI profiler who ran a nonprofit dedicated to solving unsolved
*  murders.
*  She had been interviewed by journalists and at least one podcaster.
*  She had been featured on a Netflix documentary series about a man who falsely confessed
*  to hundreds of killings.
*  Although she didn't know it at the time, flat was at a crossroads and what she had taken
*  to calling her journey.
*  A path embarked on after a prayer-born decision five years earlier to try and find who killed
*  her sister, Deborah Sue Williamson or Debbie in 1975.
*  It was now 2021.
*  Flat was middle-aged and coming out of one of the darkest moments of her life.
*  Her mother had died quite suddenly two years earlier and the grief from her death almost
*  destroyed flat.
*  Her father was gone too.
*  Dead from a heart attack after years of fighting for the police to reinvestigate Debbie's
*  killing.
*  And her older brother, Ricky, who was once a suspect in the murder, took his own life
*  five years before that.
*  She had come to Austin for a conference, CrimeCon, which formed around the same time that
*  flat began her quest.
*  At a moment now seen as an inflection point in the long history of true crime, a genre
*  is old as storytelling, but one that adapts quickly to new technologies, from the printing
*  press to social media.
*  The gathering was smaller in 2021 because of the pandemic, but Nancy Grace, queen of true
*  crime's TV era, still showed up as did Dr. Phil.
*  On podcast row, flat wandered among booths for cults, crimes and cabernet and murder-ish
*  for true crime garage and die-alog.
*  Less a fan of the genre, which she never liked that much, than a scout on a search.
*  She ran into a podcaster who covered Debbie's story a couple of years before, a man who
*  goes by the name Vincent Strange, and she commiserated with a woman whose mother's murder
*  also remained unsolved.
*  Then, at another booth, flat met a woman who would later put her in touch with two
*  investigators who presented at the conference that year.
*  George Jared and Jennifer Bucultz.
*  They were podcasters, but Jared was also a journalist and Bucultz, an adjunct professor
*  of forensics and criminal justice at the for-profit American Military University.
*  Their presentation was on another cold case, the murder of Rebecca Gould in 2004, whose
*  killer they claimed to have helped find using a technique that has quickly become a signature
*  of the changing landscape of true crime.
*  Crowdsourcing.
*  To crowdsource a crime means to call on the public at large, but especially any experts
*  among us, to aid in the search for clues, in considering suspects, in offering theories
*  and possibly in helping with an eventual arrest.
*  The idea is that the more people involved in seeking justice, the better, and that all
*  of us should have stakes and murders being solved, not only the police or bereaved family
*  members like flat.
*  Bucultz and Jared claimed the approach was crucial to their success investigating Gouldz
*  murder, and now they were looking for another cold case.
*  Debbie's sounded like the perfect one.
*  Debbie was eight when her sister was killed.
*  Debbie had just turned 18 and she was flat's whole world.
*  This was August 1975, and Debbie was newly married, living with her husband Doug Williamson
*  in a small brick house with clabboured siding and what was then a rural part of Lubbock,
*  Texas.
*  That night, a Sunday, was the birthday of flat's father, and her parents picked up Debbie
*  and took her with them to celebrate at the nearby pizza inn, where Doug was working the
*  dinnershift.
*  Their family was what we now call a blended one.
*  Flat's parents had each been married before, and while her father's two children, Paula
*  and Steve mostly lived in Minnesota with their mother, flat grew up alongside the three
*  children from her mother's first marriage, half siblings who felt like full ones.
*  Pam, Debbie, and their older brother, Ricky.
*  Debbie was the one, though, who became like a surrogate mother.
*  She was older and kind, but also goofy, so unlike flat's stricter, less demonstrative
*  parents, but also unlike Pam, who was embroiled in teenage angst at the time, and Ricky, who
*  was already out of the house and everyone said, on drugs.
*  Flat, Debbie, and her parents ate pizza that night, and then dropped Debbie back home
*  around 830.
*  Flat remembers that she asked to stay over at Debbie's house, something she did a number
*  of times that summer, and that her mom said, no, she remembers Debbie getting out of the
*  car, how pretty she was.
*  Her blonde hair still in the feathered fair of faucet cut she got for her wedding, and
*  then watching her disappear inside.
*  That night, Doug came home from the pizza in around 1am to find Debbie dead in the carport,
*  stabbed 17 times.
*  Hours later, Flat's father, Bob Lemons, woke her and Pam and told them their sister was
*  gone.
*  Flat was baptized soon after Debbie's funeral.
*  Her parents worried that if something happened to her, she wouldn't go to heaven the way everyone
*  assumed Debbie had.
*  Flat's fear in the weeks and months that followed was not about heaven or how.
*  It was that she was somehow responsible for Debbie's death.
*  If only she had found a way to stay over that night she thought she might have somehow
*  prevented it.
*  The news of Debbie's killing riveted the Lubbock community in a way that none of the other
*  murders, there were at least 19 in the city alone that year, did.
*  A reporter who worked at the Lubbock Avalanche Journal and wrote much of the early coverage,
*  Pat Rumick, told me that her editor promised to run an article on the front page of the
*  paper every day about Debbie's murder until her killer was found.
*  A commitment he kept for almost three months.
*  There were articles about a hair sent off for testing, but never the results.
*  About the search for a murder weapon that couldn't be found.
*  About the opinions of a psychic and eventually about accusations that the police
*  mishandled the crime scene.
*  There were suspects from the start but no arrests.
*  Doug sat for at least two polygraph tests but was never charged.
*  His alibi of being at work during the murder was hard to contest.
*  Ricky was also interviewed by the police, but Flat said he had an alibi as well, and
*  she thinks now that he was scrutinized so intensely at the time because of his drug
*  use, not because he ever could have killed his own sister.
*  Six months after Debbie was found dead outside her house, a reporter named Howard Swindle
*  wrote a long article in the Avalanche Journal claiming that her killing, and also those
*  of a number of women in the Lubbock area in the 1970s, were the work of the lesbian leader
*  of a devil worshiping cult.
*  His article, based on anonymous sources, was interspersed with quotes from what Swindle
*  said was the book of Satan.
*  The only charges in the murder, however, came nearly ten years later in 1984.
*  The police called Flat's father and said they had found the man who killed Debbie.
*  Henry Lee Lucas, often described as a one-eyed drifter in newspapers at the time, had confessed
*  to killing her, along with hundreds of others, mostly women in Texas in the late 1970s and
*  early 1980s.
*  Local law enforcement agencies and the Texas Rangers largely accepted Lucas's at times
*  outrageous confessions.
*  But within a couple of years, the Texas Attorney General's office released a report calling
*  a majority of them a hoax, and criticizing the police for using Lucas to clear cold
*  cases.
*  Debbie's murder investigation was reopened, at least on paper, but decades passed without
*  any movement.
*  It had, as they say in the world of true crime, gone cold.
*  A journey implies leaving your home, traveling somewhere new and a change in the landscape.
*  But often also a change in the traveler herself.
*  When Flat started on her journey in 2016, she was 49 and living with her husband and
*  her mother, Joyce Lemons, in a large suburban house in Fort Worth.
*  She had three grown children and her husband Cliff had grown children of his own.
*  She worked as a practice manager at a pediatric clinic, and knew very little about the world
*  she was about to enter, which was not only the world of law enforcement and criminal justice,
*  but also the increasingly monetized universe of true crime.
*  Flat had been praying when, as she put it, something was put heavy on my heart, telling
*  her to find her sister's killer.
*  She is not an overly religious person, at least not by her own standards, but she has
*  a knack for paying attention to signs.
*  From God, she said, but perhaps also from her own intuition.
*  It's a personality trait she attributes to the early days after her sister's murder.
*  When, amid the chaos of mourning, she felt herself slipping into the background, watching
*  others, her mother and father in particular, trying to make sense of the sea change.
*  Flat knew the road ahead would be difficult, and she thought she knew why.
*  After that prayer-born sign, she spent months practicing ways of feeling less emotionally
*  attached to the subject at hand, which was the reality that Debbie had been killed.
*  She worried about her mom, who moved in with her the year before after breaking a hip,
*  and about buoying her hopes after decades without answers.
*  She also worried about herself, specifically about looking at the evidence, including portions
*  of the case file, which her parents obtained in the 1980s and stored in a secret location
*  for years.
*  It's relatively rare for a family to be given the police file from an unsolved murder,
*  at least if that case is still considered open, which Debbie's was.
*  Flat appreciated that, but it didn't make looking through the file any easier.
*  The first document she read was a report by the officer who arrived at the scene.
*  Flat read the description of what he found.
*  His body, a broken window, an unlocked porch door.
*  She read the autopsy report, detailing each stab wound and the list of collected evidence.
*  And though she put it off, she eventually looked at the crime scene photos as well.
*  After Flat had read the entirety of the file, she picked up the phone and began making calls.
*  She reached out to the Lubbock Police first, and she eventually also talked to Debbie's
*  husband, Doug, now remarried and living in Missouri.
*  She tracked down a contact for the nonprofit, the Cold Case Foundation, and she gave an
*  interview to the Avalanche Journal.
*  She talked to Strange, whose podcast features unsolved murders and missing person cases in
*  Texas.
*  And she reached out to Remek, the former Lubbock reporter, as well as to another reporter
*  from Lubbock, Philip Hamilton, whom her parents grew close to during what Flat now calls
*  the Lucas years.
*  Somewhere in the midst of all those calls, two filmmakers contacted Flat.
*  They were working on a documentary series about Henry Lee Lucas, called The Confession
*  Killer, that would eventually air on Netflix.
*  They wanted to speak with Joyce about the role she and Bob played in exposing Lucas's
*  hoax, something Flat learned about only years after the fact.
*  They were among the first relatives of a murder victim to publicly doubt Lucas's confessions.
*  He had said that he raped Debbie when there were no signs of sexual assault, and that he
*  stabbed her inside the house when all evidence indicated that she was killed in the carport.
*  When the police largely ignored their concerns, they began investigating Lucas's confession
*  themselves, traveling across the country to interview Lucas's family members, and
*  racking up hours of phone bills, all in an effort to get Debbie's case reopened.
*  Flat and her mother sat for interviews with the filmmakers in September 2017 in their
*  Fort Worth home.
*  Joyce is thin and poised in a chair near a curtained window in the clips the documentarians
*  used.
*  Her voice wavering but clear as she tells the story of her daughter's murder, and almost
*  a decade later, the investigative work she and her husband did to prove that Lucas didn't
*  kill her.
*  They were mad, she says, that the police thought they would accept a confession that was
*  clearly wrong.
*  The flat's interviews, both at her home and during a subsequent trip to Lubbock, she
*  is pensive and sometimes teary eyed but similarly resolute.
*  Her voice growing angry only when she talks about taking over her parents' quest to see
*  Debbie's murder solved, and the resistance she said she had been getting from the Lubbock
*  police.
*  Flat hoped the exposure of the documentary would force the police's hand.
*  She wanted her mother to have that hope too, but in 2019, while they were still waiting
*  for the documentary to air, Joyce took her own life.
*  The police later told Flat that they found a copy of Flat's first interview, the one
*  from the Avalanche Journal in 2017, on the bed beside her mother, as if she had been
*  looking at it before she killed herself.
*  She was the first time Flat's faith in God wavered, but just as was the case when Debbie
*  died, she was mostly angry with herself.
*  I felt like I had let God down, she said, during one of several times we talked about the
*  weight of her mother's sudden death.
*  On that morning that she took her life, I was being told to stay home.
*  I didn't listen.
*  The confession killer came out six months later.
*  Flat had planned to give a series of interviews after the release, but she sat for only two
*  before realizing she couldn't.
*  I just didn't have the mental strength, she says.
*  I tried, but I just wasn't able to hold it together.
*  The following year was dark.
*  Another year passed, and Flat and her husband moved out of the house they had shared with
*  her mom.
*  With the move, Flat finally began to mourn.
*  It was during that period that she drove to Austin for crime con, and once she was back
*  home that she talked for the first time to Buckeleton and Jared.
*  She told them about Debbie's murder and her efforts to identify her killer, and they explained
*  their approach to investigating cold cases, including their use of crowdsourcing techniques.
*  Flat agreed to share her sister's case file with them, though she said she set up some
*  stipulations for how they should manage it.
*  And she and Buckeleton agreed to set up a Facebook group dedicated to Debbie's case, where,
*  as an administrator, Buckeleton began posting about Debbie and encouraging others to join
*  her and Jared in their investigation.
*  She uploaded early newspaper coverage of Debbie's killing, from when much of Lubbock was obsessed
*  with solving it, and shared information that hadn't been previously released.
*  A list of evidence collected by the police, a map of house's canvas after the murder,
*  a diagram of the crime scene.
*  I am so glad her murder case has been resurrected.
*  A new member wrote in the early weeks of that Facebook group.
*  It went cold right away and needs investigating.
*  On the anniversary of Debbie's death in August, Flat returned to Lubbock, and Buckeleton
*  Jared drove in from Colorado and Arkansas to join her.
*  They stayed a week, and on one of their first nights in town, Jared told me, he had a long
*  conversation with Flat about what working with him and Buckeleton might entail.
*  I was very honest with her from the beginning, Jared said, if you can just generate a lot
*  of media attention, it will force the hand of law enforcement.
*  But here's the side effect of that.
*  You are going to lose control of what's said about this case.
*  His focus in that conversation at least was on using crowdsourcing to bring greater awareness
*  to the crime itself.
*  But Buckeleton, who declined an interview but did answer some questions via email, said
*  that crowdsourcing also potentially ferries more resources to an investigation and allows
*  those who are hesitant to talk with the police a safer option for sharing what they might
*  know.
*  Though police tried to dedicate ample time to murder investigations when they happened,
*  she wrote, the power of several people reinvestigating all the facts with fresh eyes and different
*  skills cannot be underestimated.
*  Among Buckeleton and Jared's trip to Lubbock, much of which was either catalogued on Facebook
*  or recorded for future podcast episodes, they surveyed the house and carport where Debbie
*  was murdered and placed flowers on her grave.
*  They met with residents interested in the killing, contacted people who knew Debbie and
*  Doug in the 1970s, and sat for an interview with a local news station, whose reporter noted
*  that the duo recently helped uncover a tip that led to an arrest in a cold case in Arkansas,
*  and that they're confident that they could do the same here.
*  Buckeleton also tagged along on flat's annual visit to talk with the police, which left
*  her more hopeful than in the past.
*  Flat met a new officer, Sergeant Justin Anderson, who she said seemed genuine in his desire
*  to reinvestigate Debbie's case.
*  Summer slipped into fall, and membership in Debbie's Facebook group continued to rise.
*  Buckeleton posted every few days and shared links to brief articles she wrote about the
*  investigation and to each new episode of her podcast, Break the Case, which was hosted
*  at and sponsored by American Military University, her employer.
*  She also responded to questions or theories posted by others in the group, no matter how
*  outlandish.
*  In a self-published book she and Jared later released about Debbie's murder, the two
*  investigators outline a number of social media tactics they use to get others invested
*  and actively participating in their Facebook groups, including, in a previous case, planting
*  a heel, a wrestling term for someone who plays the villain within the case.
*  Our heels would pose provocative questions at our behest.
*  They write, this frequently resulted in the person we'd hoped to connect with, sending
*  us a private message expressing their outrage.
*  In turn, this allowed us to start a dialogue with those people, which was our primary goal.
*  Information continued to flow.
*  Other byproduct of Buckeleton's efforts was the slow building of community.
*  As more people began participating in the group, more of them also seemed to take ownership
*  of the task at hand.
*  Suddenly, it was not only flat who wanted answers in her sister's murder.
*  There were dozens of others pushing for a resolution as well.
*  Then hundreds and eventually, more than a thousand.
*  In November 2021, five months after the Facebook group was started, Buckeleton announced some
*  movement in the case.
*  The Lubbock Police had agreed to work with a new cold case unit at the Texas Attorney
*  General's office.
*  This means more investigators are now on board to find Debbie's killer, and her case has
*  been designated their top priority, Buckeleton's posted.
*  Then, presumably addressing the murderer, she added,
*  you ran for 46 years, but you can no longer hide.
*  By that point, flat says she felt that she and Buckeleton had become friends.
*  They talked regularly, mostly about the investigation, but sometimes, at least in her memory of those
*  conversations, about personal things.
*  Flatts, kids, or Buckeleton's marriage.
*  Then in December, Buckeleton started getting testy with her, flat says, and her reading of
*  their relationship.
*  She wondered if the change had something to do with Buckeleton and Jared's announcement
*  that they would be helping crime con in one of its newest ventures.
*  The company's online subscription service, Crime HQ, was starting a series called Cold
*  Case Club, which would stream live and recorded zoom presentations about murder investigations.
*  And they wanted a multi-part series on Debbie's case, led by Buckeleton's and Jared.
*  Buckeleton told me via email that she had hoped participating in the Cold Case Club would
*  bring more attention to Debbie's murder.
*  In the process of preparing for those zoom presentations, though, she agreed to share Debbie's
*  case file with a producer with the company.
*  When flat found out, in a conversation with Buckeleton's less than a week before her
*  own zoom interview, she was upset.
*  Their agreement, flat told me, had been that Buckeleton would not share the file with anyone
*  without her permission, in part because flat worried that releasing too much information
*  might hurt a potential future arrest.
*  But Buckeleton characterized their arrangement differently.
*  I did verbally say I would not publicize the file, meaning I would not put it online
*  where anyone and everyone could access it.
*  She wrote in an email, I did not agree to never share it with anyone else.
*  Flat recorded the conversation she and Buckeleton had about the case file in late January
*  2022.
*  And listening to it, it seems clear that Buckeleton's new flat wouldn't be happy about her sharing
*  the file.
*  But also that she believed it was the right decision if they wanted Debbie's case to
*  progress as she phrases it.
*  I'm not saying there aren't things you need to share.
*  Flat says at one point, I just want to know ahead of time so I'm okay with it.
*  You would have said no, Buckeleton's response, and I wouldn't be able to do this for Debbie.
*  Please understand, we're doing everything that needs to be done to find this killer.
*  She adds later in that same conversation.
*  That is the goal, correct?
*  Not controlling everything?
*  Do you want us to find him or not?
*  Oh, Jen, flat responds.
*  I feel like you're manipulating this, and I just need to stop and think without saying
*  something I regret or that's an appropriate or that I'm just acting off emotions.
*  So I just need to kind of step back for a moment and let's just talk later.
*  Buckeleton says that flat needs to trust her.
*  You said you would trust me.
*  She repeats almost pleading.
*  I did trust you, flat says.
*  The fallout after that was quick.
*  Jared wrote flat a long email explaining how much work he and Buckeleton had already
*  put into the case and why she was wrong to be upset.
*  He asked whether she planned to appear on the upcoming Zoom presentation for the cold
*  case club, or if he and Buckeleton should use their backup plan.
*  Flat wrote that they should use that plan.
*  But after trying and failing to set up a time to talk over the disagreement with Buckeleton,
*  flat changed her mind.
*  On the day of the scheduled Zoom session, she asked to join after all.
*  Buckeleton Jared said no.
*  Buckeleton's told me in an email that they were unsure how flat would act or what she
*  would say.
*  The session was titled, Assisters Fight for Answers and had been advertised as being about
*  flat search to find Debbie's killer.
*  So when flat learned she wouldn't be participating, she decided to join as an audience member instead.
*  Buckeleton later claimed that flat was extremely disruptive in the chat during that hour long
*  session, a characterization flat disputes.
*  There is no available record of the Zoom chat.
*  When the presentation ended around 8 p.m., Buckeleton logged on to Facebook and removed
*  flat as both an administrator and a member of her sister's group.
*  Flat said she was shocked when she received the removal email from Facebook, and around
*  that time she began encouraging others, Doug and representatives from the Cold Case Foundation
*  to pull out from their scheduled Zoom interviews as well.
*  When they agreed, CrimeCon ended the series on Debbie's murder early, citing significant
*  discord between a member of Debbie's family and the two case investigators.
*  At that same time, Jared released a new episode of his podcast, Diamond State Murder Board,
*  with Buckeleton as a guest.
*  The episode was titled, Family Matters and the opening description read, Sometimes the
*  closest people to the case are the biggest obstacles to the truth.
*  Flat was in her backyard with her two dogs when she heard it.
*  She listened as Jared criticized her actions over the previous weeks, and then as Buckeleton
*  agreed that Flat had seriously disrupted their investigation.
*  In Military Speak, said Buckeleton, who is also a former counterintelligence agent in
*  the army, this is an attempt at sabotage.
*  What started Flat crying, however, was what she heard next.
*  And here's the thing, she's not sabotaging you or me.
*  Jared said, she's sabotaging the case.
*  Yeah, Buckeleton responded, her sister, her murdered sister, and what goes through my
*  head is how would Debbie feel about this?
*  And I don't think she'd be very happy.
*  A couple of months later, in April, Flat gave an interview to a Lubbock news station,
*  in which she outlined some seemingly positive developments in Debbie's case.
*  Namely, that Sergeant Anderson had agreed to send evidence out for advanced DNA testing
*  to a private lab, but also critiques of Jared and Buckeleton, including that they had removed
*  her from her sister's Facebook group.
*  Buckeleton took to the group that same day.
*  I know this is circulating around, so I'm just going to post it.
*  She wrote, before linking to Flat's interview, if anyone on this group is an agreement
*  with Liz's point of view on us, please see yourself out of the group right now.
*  Some members left or were removed, but those who remained seemed to have found the villain
*  they had been searching for.
*  Flat.
*  What a miserable person she is.
*  One of those members wrote in one of dozens of posts or comments in that group about Flat.
*  She wants all focus on her, not solving the murder.
*  This case I hope won't go cold again, but we will see.
*  If it does go cold again, Buckeleton responded, there's only one person to blame.
*  Does Liz actually know who the killer is?
*  Someone else asked.
*  I thought the same thing, another member of the group responded.
*  Who's she protecting?
*  Last November, I flew to Dallas to meet with Flat, and a woman named Tiffany Ballard Moore,
*  the sister of Rebecca Gould, whose killer Buckeleton Jared claimed to have helped find.
*  Vincent Strange, the Texas True Crime podcaster, came as well.
*  Tiffany and Flat have become friends over the years.
*  She first reached out to him around the same time she and I got in touch in 2017.
*  I lived in Lubbock around that time and had become fascinated by the story of Debbie's
*  murder investigation.
*  Both the way it was initially mishandled by the police and the frenzy detention at Garner
*  in subsequent years.
*  I had been following Flat's story, checking in with her about once a year for the past
*  five years.
*  Now we were meeting outside a panera bread just off a highway in Denton on a morning
*  blanketed by rain clouds.
*  Flat arrived in an SUV in the back of which she had two tobs, one with a case file, which
*  I had asked to look at, and the other with fake flowers and brushes for when she visited
*  her mother's grave the following day.
*  Her walk toward us while we were talking, in jeans and bright white tennis shoes, her
*  long round hair slick straight.
*  She and Flat hugged.
*  It was their first time meeting in person.
*  They found each other only a few months earlier, soon after they realized how much they had
*  in common.
*  More was in her twenties when her sister was killed in 2004.
*  They had been living together in Fayetteville, Arkansas, where Gould was enrolled in a local
*  community college.
*  One weekend Gould drove to nearby Melbourne and she never returned.
*  Her body was found a week later on a hillside off a highway in Arkansas.
*  And although the police had suspects, her case went unsolved for more than 15 years.
*  What eventually brought wider attention to the murder was a podcast called Hell and Gone,
*  which debuted in 2018 and proposes that Gould's boyfriend may have killed her.
*  Soon after that, Buckelts got interested in the mystery too, and she teamed up with
*  Jared, who had covered the murder as a cub reporter in Arkansas.
*  Both zeroed in eventually on Gould's boyfriend as their primary suspect as well, and chatter
*  about him was common in the Facebook group Buckelts set up in Gould's name in 2019.
*  But another occasional target in that group is Moore, who refused to go on air with
*  the Hell and Gone host Catherine Townsend, or later with Buckelts.
*  Moore also criticized them and Jared online for casting suspicion on Gould's boyfriend,
*  who was interviewed by the police but never charged.
*  Members of Buckelts' Facebook group wrote that Moore didn't actually want to see her sister's
*  murder solved.
*  They wrote that she had obstructed justice, and at least one of them called her a bag
*  of trash.
*  People think it's a movie, Moore said once we all had coffee and pastries and had found
*  a table inside.
*  I don't think people think logically when they get into those groups, they think the absolute
*  worst.
*  Before she met flat, Moore said she rarely talked with others about the Facebook group.
*  She worried that people wouldn't believe her, even after it turned out she had been
*  right to defend her sister's boyfriend.
*  In 2020, the police arrested a man named William Miller for Rebecca Gould's murder.
*  Afterward Buckelts and Jared and also Townsend claimed that their efforts had helped the police
*  close the case, either by putting pressure on them to investigate or, in the case of Buckelts
*  and Jared, by realizing that Miller was a member of Gould's Facebook group.
*  But the officer who identified and arrested Miller, special agent Mike McNeill, told me
*  that just isn't true.
*  He was assigned Gould's case after the former detective on it announced his retirement,
*  he said, and he found Miller through his own process of elimination.
*  Moore and flat found each other two years later.
*  Soon after Buckelts and Jared made that podcast about the difficulties of working with families
*  of victims, the podcast mentions Moore as well, just not by name.
*  Flat said sometimes Moore would call her up and sound at peace.
*  Miller had pleaded guilty to her sister's murder, and Moore attended his sentencing hearing
*  earlier that fall.
*  He apologized for what he did, and is now in prison sentenced to 40 years.
*  Flat felt as if Moore had everything that she still sought, closure, justice, and an end
*  to her search.
*  But other times, Moore would call flat distraught, and it was always about something that happened
*  with Buckelts and Jared, who also attended Miller's sentencing hearing, and who wrote
*  and posted and released podcasts about it online.
*  In the Facebook group, they and others still suspected Gould's boyfriend of playing
*  some part in the murder.
*  Miller was his cousin, even though McNeill has made it clear that the boyfriend had nothing
*  to do with it.
*  They have continued to criticize Moore as well, for her appearance on a date line episode
*  about Gould more recently, and during Miller's sentencing, for not putting flowers on her
*  sister's grave, as Buckelts and Jared did that day.
*  The reason she didn't, Moore told us that morning, was because she had taken her younger
*  sister Danielle to the hearing, and Danielle was on her fourth round of chemotherapy at
*  the time and needed to go home and rest.
*  Danielle died this year.
*  It's so frustrating, Moore said.
*  And honestly, that type of stuff is what gets me going and makes me wear them like, like
*  they're not going to stop.
*  Flat said, as Moore searched for words.
*  The two women said they feel as if the stories being spun about them, and the crowds that
*  have built up around their sisters, won't disappear anytime soon.
*  Debbie's husband, Doug, would later tell me that he is trying to avoid talking with
*  his adult daughter about Debbie's murder because he supports flat, whom he can still remember
*  as an eight year old.
*  And his daughter is a member of Debbie's Facebook group, and has been impressed by much of Buckelts
*  and Jared's investigation.
*  Moore's father, from whom she is estranged, supports Buckelts and Jared as well.
*  In details of their strained family dynamics, Moore's parents divorced when she was young,
*  have also been at times part of the chatter on Gould's Facebook group.
*  I shouldn't care about what people think about me, but I do.
*  Moore told me in a quiet voice at one point.
*  I think that's why the things that they say hurt.
*  On Facebook, meanwhile, Buckelts and Jared have argued that Moore started the fight
*  by criticizing their investigation publicly, and that flat has been going after them, not
*  the other way around.
*  Buckelts has also made the case that no family member can or should control a murder investigation,
*  and that the general public, too, has stakes in a murder's being solved.
*  Flat and Moore talked to the Panera bread for more than three hours that morning, as
*  it rained off and on.
*  They traded ideas for how to address their shared problem, including defamation lawsuits
*  and signing contracts with podcasters or private investigators about what information can or
*  cannot be released.
*  But they also talked about their sisters, who they were, and what they were like when
*  they were still a part of this world.
*  Flat brought out photos of Debbie, along with letters her parents had written during their
*  search to see her murder solved.
*  Moore told us about her and Gould's silly fights over clothes, and mid-sentence she
*  began to cry.
*  You've already gone through trauma, and then they put you through more trauma.
*  More reassured flat at one point.
*  After flat confessed that sometimes she feels like giving up.
*  And you shouldn't have to go through that.
*  Nobody should have to go through anything like that.
*  I just pray and it's like, God, what am I supposed to do?
*  Flat said, what am I supposed to do?
*  Debbie talked to me and direct me.
*  What am I supposed to do?
*  What she eventually did was push the police to test any final evidence in Debbie's case.
*  And six months after we all met up in Denton, flat returned to where this story began.
*  Lubbock, Texas, to witness the exhumation of her sister's remains.
*  I flew out to join her, and at sunrise on a Wednesday in May, I was at the cemetery
*  where Debbie was buried nearly 50 years earlier.
*  Flat and her son Matt Bentley picked me up at the funeral home in his white pickup truck,
*  and we drove together to the grave site.
*  The plan she told me earlier was to unearth Debbie's coffin in search of viable DNA samples,
*  her own and also potentially, those of whoever killed her.
*  Debbie's grave was staked off already when we parked a middle line of mostly unmarked police
*  cars at the grass's edge.
*  We stood along the cemetery lawn, watching a backhoe pull earth from the ground.
*  Then we waited into the graveyard toward Debbie's headstone.
*  She told me she slept restlessly the night before.
*  As much out of concern for what would happen today, was it right to dig up her sister's
*  body she kept asking herself?
*  Would that bring her the answers she sought?
*  As out of fear about what those from the Facebook group would do or say once they learned
*  that Debbie had been exhumed.
*  The backhoe shuttered to a stop, and two workers from the funeral home jumped into the grave
*  with shovels to dig out the rest of the earth by hand.
*  Flat held onto her son's arm and watched them, while her other hand trembled almost imperceptibly.
*  A couple of weeks earlier, Flat's older sister Paula Chasse from her father's side of the
*  family told me that the main hope she had now was not that Debbie's case would one day
*  be solved, a goal that feels less and less realistic.
*  But that Flat would be able to let it go.
*  Liz has been torn apart, she said.
*  I feel bad for her, but I wish she could just walk away.
*  Bentley told me that he urged his mom the night before to accept that she had done what
*  she could for her sister.
*  He was convinced that she heard him, and that this would be her last attempt to see Debbie's
*  case solved.
*  It was also from what I gathered talking to a forensic anthropologist present at the
*  exhumation, one containing only the slimmest chance that any useful evidence would be found.
*  And weeks later, Flat would also learn that the answers from the DNA analysis, if they
*  come, could take much longer than she expected, possibly years, though the police say hopefully
*  months.
*  But morning in love, though, Flat felt that at least something was being done.
*  She stood in the sun beside Bentley and the dozen or so police officers, including Sergeant
*  Anderson and a couple of victims advocates.
*  And we watched as the funeral home workers laid their shovels aside and began to rest Debbie's
*  vault from the ground.
*  We watched as they hauled that vault onto a tractor bed and drove it to a drafty warehouse
*  nearby.
*  Where it was pride-open to reveal Debbie's coffin, pale green with emblazoned silver flowers.
*  And then as that coffin, its latch rusted shut, had to be pride-opened as well.
*  We watched as a forensic specialist placed samples from Debbie's body, her hair, her fingernails,
*  part of a bone, into individually labeled envelopes on a wooden table beside the coffin,
*  filling rainwater onto a concrete floor.
*  Then all of us, except for one officer and Flat's son, stepped out of the warehouse to
*  give Flat time to say goodbye once more to her sister Debbie.
*  It was a decision Flat would later tell me she regretted.
*  She said goodbye to Debbie at that cemetery when she was eight.
*  The body at rest and her coffin was no longer her sister.
*  She knew that.
*  When facing her remains only showed her how much time had passed.
*  How long that dirt had been settled.
*  How impossible return really is.
*  No matter if this particular mystery is one day solved or not.
