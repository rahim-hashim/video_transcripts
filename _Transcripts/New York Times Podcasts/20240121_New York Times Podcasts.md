# The Sunday Read: ‘Podcasters Took Up Her Sister’s Murder Investigation. Then They Turned on Her’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2-MIoz5eDI)
*  True crime is as old as storytelling.
*  The cultural obsession, it's nothing new.
*  One thing that true crime kind of excels at though is it adapts to new technology and
*  media formats really well.
*  From the printing press to podcasts and Facebook.
*  And with this, we've seen the development of what some people call the true crime industrial
*  complex.
*  It's a huge business.
*  And it can also be an emotional minefield for victims' families.
*  My name's Sarah Boreen and I'm a contributing writer for the New York Times Magazine.
*  And I used to live in Lubbock, Texas, where this week's Sunday Read takes place.
*  It's a piece I wrote for the magazine about a woman named Liz Flat, whose sister, Deborah
*  Sue Williamson, or Debbie, was murdered almost 50 years ago when Debbie was 18 and Liz was
*  just eight.
*  My story follows Liz's efforts to solve her sister's murder and how in the process,
*  she became a target of some of the very people who also wanted to see her sister's murder
*  solved.
*  So the trouble for Liz begins in 2021.
*  Decades had passed since her sister's killing.
*  From Liz's perspective, the police weren't really making any progress on the case.
*  And Liz had already tried a bunch of other avenues.
*  Appearing on podcasts, talking to journalists, working with a nonprofit that focused on cold
*  cases.
*  She was even part of a true crime documentary on Netflix.
*  Increasingly desperate, she finds herself at CrimeCon, which is the biggest true crime
*  conference in the United States, possibly even in the world.
*  And there she meets these two independent investigators slash podcasters.
*  One is also a journalist and the other an adjunct professor at a university.
*  They're interested in helping Liz solve her sister's case with crowdsourcing.
*  It's not a new idea, crowdsourcing, but it's relatively new to the world of true crime.
*  The idea is this.
*  If you get a group of people together who are interested in solving a crime, you'll
*  have more manpower and expertise that could help you find clues and potentially identify
*  suspects.
*  Liz agrees to let the investigators take on her sister's case and they set up a Facebook
*  page dedicated to building a community of people who would help crowdsource the case.
*  But soon it all goes completely south.
*  First, Liz and the investigators argue over sensitive documents related to her sister's
*  murder and then Liz herself becomes part of the gossip of the crowdsourcing community.
*  It snowballs into a deeper disagreement over a question that I think is central to this
*  story.
*  Are there times when our collective desire to solve the mystery or to catch the criminal
*  actually does more harm than good?
*  So here's my article, read by Samantha Dez.
*  Our audio producer today is Adrienne Hurst.
*  The original music was written and performed by Erin Esposito.
*  Liz Flat drove to Austin mostly out of desperation.
*  She had tried talking with the police.
*  She had tried working with a former FBI profiler who ran a nonprofit dedicated to solving unsolved
*  murders.
*  She had been interviewed by journalists and at least one podcaster.
*  She had been featured on a Netflix documentary series about a man who falsely confessed to
*  hundreds of killings.
*  Although she didn't know it at the time, Flat was at a crossroads and what she had taken
*  to calling her journey.
*  A path embarked on after a prayer-born decision five years earlier to try and find who killed
*  her sister, Deborah Sue Williamson, or Debbie, in 1975.
*  It was now 2021.
*  Flat was middle-aged and coming out of one of the darkest moments of her life.
*  Her mother had died quite suddenly two years earlier, and the grief from her death almost
*  destroyed Flat.
*  Her father was gone too, dead from a heart attack after years of fighting for the police
*  to reinvestigate Debbie's killing.
*  And her older brother, Ricky, who was once a suspect in the murder, took his own life
*  five years before that.
*  She had come to Austin for a conference, Crime Con, which formed around the same time that
*  Flat began her quest.
*  At a moment now seen as an inflection point in the long history of true crime, a genre
*  as old as storytelling, but one that adapts quickly to new technologies, from the printing
*  press to social media.
*  The gathering was smaller in 2021 because of the pandemic, but Nancy Grace, queen of
*  true crime's TV era, still showed up, as did Dr. Phil.
*  In podcast row, Flat wandered among booths for Cults, Crimes, and Cabernet, and Murderish
*  for True Crime Garage and Die-a-Log, less a fan of the genre, which she never liked
*  that much, than a scout on a search.
*  She ran into a podcaster who covered Debbie's story a couple of years before, a man who
*  goes by the name Vincent Strange, and she commiserated with a woman whose mother's murder
*  also remained unsolved.
*  Then, at another booth, Flat met a woman who would later put her in touch with two investigators
*  who presented at the conference that year, George Jared and Jennifer Buchholz.
*  They were podcasters, but Jared was also a journalist, and Buchholz, an adjunct professor
*  of forensics and criminal justice at the for-profit American Military University.
*  Their presentation was on another cold case, the murder of Rebecca Gould in 2004, whose
*  killer they claimed to have helped find using a technique that has quickly become a signature
*  of the changing landscape of true crime, crowdsourcing.
*  To crowdsource a crime means to call on the public at large, but especially any experts
*  among us, to aid in the search for clues, in considering suspects, in offering theories
*  and possibly in helping with an eventual arrest.
*  The idea is that the more people involved in seeking justice, the better, and that all
*  of us should have stakes in murders being solved, not only the police or bereaved family
*  members like Flat.
*  Buchholz and Jared claimed the approach was crucial to their success investigating Gould's
*  murder, and now they were looking for another cold case.
*  Debbie's sounded like the perfect one.
*  Flat was eight when her sister was killed.
*  Debbie had just turned 18, and she was Flat's whole world.
*  This was August, 1975, and Debbie was newly married,
*  living with her husband, Doug Williamson, in a small brick house with clabbered siding
*  in what was then a rural part of Lubbock, Texas.
*  That night, a Sunday, was the birthday of Flat's father, and her parents picked up
*  Debbie and took her with them to celebrate at the nearby pizza inn, where Doug was working
*  the dinner shift.
*  Their family was what we now call a blended one.
*  Flat's parents had each been married before, and while her father's two children, Paula
*  and Steve, mostly lived in Minnesota with their mother, Flat grew up alongside the three
*  children from her mother's first marriage, half siblings who felt like full ones,
*  Pam, Debbie, and their older brother, Ricky.
*  Debbie was the one, though, who became like a surrogate mother.
*  She was older and kind, but also goofy, so unlike Flat's stricter,
*  less demonstrative parents, but also unlike Pam, who was embroiled in teenage angst at
*  the time, and Ricky, who was already out of the house and, everyone said, on drugs.
*  Flat, Debbie, and her parents ate pizza that night and
*  then dropped Debbie back home around 830.
*  Flat remembers that she asked to stay over at Debbie's house,
*  something she did a number of times that summer, and that her mom said no.
*  She remembers Debbie getting out of the car, how pretty she was,
*  her blonde hair still in the feathered Farrah Fawcett cut she got for her wedding,
*  and then watching her disappear inside.
*  That night, Doug came home from the pizza inn around 1 AM to find Debbie dead
*  in the carport, stabbed 17 times.
*  Hours later, Flat's father, Bob Lemons, woke her and Pam and
*  told them their sister was gone.
*  Flat was baptized soon after Debbie's funeral.
*  Her parents worried that if something happened to her,
*  she wouldn't go to heaven the way everyone assumed Debbie had.
*  But Flat's fear in the weeks and months that followed was not about heaven or hell.
*  It was that she was somehow responsible for Debbie's death.
*  If only she had found a way to stay over that night,
*  she thought, she might have somehow prevented it.
*  The news of Debbie's killing riveted the Lubbock community in a way that none of
*  the other murders, there were at least 19 in the city alone that year, did.
*  A reporter who worked at the Lubbock Avalanche Journal and
*  wrote much of the early coverage, Pat Remick, told me that her editor promised
*  to run an article on the front page of the paper every day about Debbie's murder
*  until her killer was found, a commitment he kept for almost three months.
*  There were articles about a hair sent off for testing, but never the results,
*  about the search for a murder weapon that couldn't be found, about the opinions of
*  a psychic, and eventually about accusations that the police mishandled the crime scene.
*  There were suspects from the start, but no arrests.
*  Doug sat for at least two polygraph tests, but was never charged.
*  His alibi of being at work during the murder was hard to contest.
*  Ricky was also interviewed by the police, but Flat said he had an alibi as well.
*  And she thinks now that he was scrutinized so intensely at the time because of his
*  drug use, not because he ever could have killed his own sister.
*  Six months after Debbie was found dead outside her house,
*  a reporter named Howard Swindle wrote a long article in the Avalanche Journal
*  claiming that her killing, and also those of a number of women in the Lubbock area
*  in the 1970s, were the work of the lesbian leader of a devil worshiping cult.
*  His article, based on anonymous sources,
*  was interspersed with quotes from what Swindle said was the book of Satan.
*  The only charges in the murder, however, came nearly ten years later in 1984.
*  The police called Flat's father and said they had found the man who killed Debbie,
*  Henry Lee Lucas, often described as a one-eyed drifter in newspapers at
*  the time, had confessed to killing her, along with hundreds of others,
*  mostly women in Texas in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
*  Local law enforcement agencies and
*  the Texas Rangers largely accepted Lucas's at times outrageous confessions.
*  But within a couple of years, the Texas Attorney General's office released
*  a report calling a majority of them a hoax and
*  criticizing the police for using Lucas to clear cold cases.
*  Debbie's murder investigation was reopened, at least on paper,
*  but decades passed without any movement.
*  It had, as they say in the world of true crime, gone cold.
*  A journey implies leaving your home,
*  traveling somewhere new and a change in the landscape.
*  But often also a change in the traveler herself.
*  When Flat started on her journey in 2016, she was 49 and
*  living with her husband and her mother, Joyce Lemons,
*  in a large suburban house in Fort Worth.
*  She had three grown children and her husband, Cliff, had grown children of his own.
*  She worked as a practice manager at a pediatric clinic and
*  knew very little about the world she was about to enter.
*  Which was not only the world of law enforcement and criminal justice, but
*  also the increasingly monetized universe of true crime.
*  Flat had been praying when, as she put it, something was put heavy on my heart,
*  telling her to find her sister's killer.
*  She is not an overly religious person, at least not by her own standards, but
*  she has a knack for paying attention to signs.
*  From God, she said, but perhaps also from her own intuition.
*  It's a personality trait she attributes to the early days after her sister's
*  murder, when, amid the chaos of mourning,
*  she felt herself slipping into the background, watching others, her mother and
*  father in particular, trying to make sense of the sea change.
*  Flat knew the road ahead would be difficult, and she thought she knew why.
*  After that prayer-born sign, she spent months practicing ways of feeling less
*  emotionally attached to the subject at hand, which was the reality that
*  Debbie had been killed.
*  She worried about her mom, who moved in with her the year before after breaking a hip,
*  and about buoying her hopes after decades without answers.
*  She also worried about herself, specifically about looking at the evidence,
*  including portions of the case file, which her parents obtained in the 1980s and
*  stored in a secret location for years.
*  It's relatively rare for a family to be given the police file from an unsolved
*  murder, at least if that case is still considered open, which Debbie's was.
*  Flat appreciated that, but it didn't make looking through the file any easier.
*  The first document she read was a report by the officer who arrived at the scene.
*  Flat read the description of what he found.
*  Debbie's body, a broken window, an unlocked porch door.
*  She read the autopsy report, detailing each stab wound and
*  the list of collected evidence.
*  And though she put it off, she eventually looked at the crime scene photos as well.
*  After Flat had read the entirety of the file,
*  she picked up the phone and began making calls.
*  She reached out to the Lubbock police first, and
*  she eventually also talked to Debbie's husband, Doug,
*  now remarried and living in Missouri.
*  She tracked down a contact for the nonprofit, The Cold Case Foundation, and
*  she gave an interview to the Avalanche Journal.
*  She talked to Strange, whose podcast features unsolved murders and
*  missing person cases in Texas.
*  And she reached out to Remick, the former Lubbock reporter,
*  as well as to another reporter from Lubbock, Philip Hamilton,
*  whom her parents grew close to during what Flat now calls the Lucas years.
*  Somewhere in the midst of all those calls, two filmmakers contacted Flat.
*  They were working on a documentary series about Henry Lee Lucas called
*  The Confession Killer that would eventually air on Netflix.
*  And they wanted to speak with Joyce about the role she and
*  Bob played in exposing Lucas' hoax,
*  something Flat learned about only years after the fact.
*  They were among the first relatives of a murder victim to publicly doubt
*  Lucas' confessions.
*  He had said that he raped Debbie when there were no signs of sexual assault, and
*  that he stabbed her inside the house when all evidence indicated that she was
*  killed in the carport.
*  When the police largely ignored their concerns,
*  they began investigating Lucas' confession themselves,
*  traveling across the country to interview Lucas' family members, and
*  racking up hours of phone bills, all in an effort to get Debbie's case reopened.
*  Flat and her mother sat for interviews with the filmmakers in September 2017 in
*  their Fort Worth home.
*  Joyce is thin and poised in a chair near a curtained window in the clips the
*  documentarians used.
*  Her voice wavering but clear as she tells the story of her daughter's murder.
*  And almost a decade later, the investigative work she and
*  her husband did to prove that Lucas didn't kill her.
*  They were mad, she says, that the police thought they would accept a confession
*  that was clearly wrong.
*  In Flat's interviews, both at her home and during a subsequent trip to Lubbock,
*  she is pensive and sometimes teary-eyed, but similarly resolute.
*  Her voice growing angry only when she talks about taking over her parents' quest
*  to see Debbie's murder solved and the resistance she said she had been getting
*  from the Lubbock police.
*  Flat hoped the exposure of the documentary would force the police's hand.
*  She wanted her mother to have that hope too.
*  But in 2019, while they were still waiting for the documentary to air,
*  Joyce took her own life.
*  The police later told Flat that they found a copy of Flat's first interview,
*  the one from the Avalanche Journal in 2017, on the bed beside her mother,
*  as if she had been looking at it before she killed herself.
*  It was the first time Flat's faith in God wavered.
*  But just as was the case when Debbie died, she was mostly angry with herself.
*  I felt like I had let God down, she said.
*  During one of several times, we talked about the weight of her mother's sudden
*  death.
*  On that morning that she took her life, I was being told to stay home.
*  I didn't listen.
*  The confession killer came out six months later.
*  Flat had planned to give a series of interviews after the release, but
*  she sat for only two before realizing she couldn't.
*  I just didn't have the mental strength, she says.
*  I tried, but I just wasn't able to hold it together.
*  The next year was dark.
*  Another year passed, and Flat and her husband moved out of the house they had
*  shared with her mom.
*  With the move, Flat finally began to mourn.
*  It was during that period that she drove to Austin for CrimeCon, and
*  once she was back home, that she talked for the first time to Buchholz and Jared.
*  She told them about Debbie's murder and her efforts to identify her killer, and
*  explained their approach to investigating cold cases,
*  including their use of crowdsourcing techniques.
*  Flat agreed to share her sister's case file with them, though she said she set
*  up some stipulations for how they should manage it.
*  And she and Buchholz agreed to set up a Facebook group dedicated to Debbie's
*  case, where, as an administrator, Buchholz began posting about Debbie and
*  encouraging others to join her and Jared in their investigation.
*  She uploaded early newspaper coverage of Debbie's killing, from when much of
*  Lubbock was obsessed with solving it, and shared information that hadn't been
*  previously released, a list of evidence collected by the police,
*  a map of houses canvassed after the murder, a diagram of the crime scene.
*  I am so glad her murder case has been resurrected,
*  a new member wrote in the early weeks of that Facebook group.
*  It went cold right away and needs investigating.
*  On the anniversary of Debbie's death in August, Flat returned to Lubbock, and
*  Buchholz and Jared drove in from Colorado and Arkansas to join her.
*  They stayed a week, and on one of their first nights in town, Jared told me,
*  he had a long conversation with Flat about what working with him and
*  Buchholz might entail.
*  I was very honest with her from the beginning, Jared said.
*  If you can just generate a lot of media attention,
*  it will force the hand of law enforcement.
*  But here's the side effect of that,
*  you are going to lose control of what's said about this case.
*  His focus, in that conversation at least,
*  was on using crowd sourcing to bring greater awareness to the crime itself.
*  But Buchholz, who declined an interview but did answer some questions via email,
*  said that crowd sourcing also potentially ferries more resources to an investigation,
*  and allows those who are hesitant to talk with the police
*  a safer option for sharing what they might know.
*  Though police try to dedicate ample time to murder investigations when they happen,
*  she wrote, the power of several people re-investigating all the facts with fresh
*  eyes and different skills cannot be underestimated.
*  During Buchholz and Jared's trip to Lubbock, much of which was either cataloged on
*  Facebook or recorded for future podcast episodes, they surveyed the house and
*  carport where Debbie was murdered and placed flowers on her grave.
*  They met with residents interested in the killing, contacted people who knew Debbie
*  and Doug in the 1970s, and sat for an interview with a local news station,
*  whose reporter noted that, the duo recently helped uncover a tip that led to an arrest
*  in a cold case in Arkansas, and that they're confident that they could do the same here.
*  Buchholz also tagged along on Flat's annual visit to talk with the police,
*  which left her more hopeful than in the past.
*  Flat met a new officer, Sergeant Justin Anderson,
*  who she said seemed genuine in his desire to re-investigate Debbie's case.
*  Summer slipped into fall, and membership in Debbie's Facebook group continued to rise.
*  Buchholz posted every few days and shared links to brief articles she wrote about
*  the investigation and to each new episode of her podcast, Break the Case,
*  which was hosted at and sponsored by American Military University, her employer.
*  She also responded to questions or
*  theories posted by others in the group, no matter how outlandish.
*  In a self-published book she and Jared later released about Debbie's murder,
*  the two investigators outline a number of social media tactics they use to get
*  others invested and actively participating in their Facebook groups,
*  including, in a previous case, planting a heel,
*  a wrestling term for someone who plays the villain within the group.
*  Our heels would pose provocative questions at our behest, they write.
*  This frequently resulted in the person we'd hoped to connect with
*  sending us a private message expressing their outrage.
*  In turn, this allowed us to start a dialogue with those people,
*  which was our primary goal.
*  Information continued to flow.
*  Another byproduct of Buchholz's efforts was the slow building of community.
*  As more people began participating in the group,
*  more of them also seemed to take ownership of the task at hand.
*  Suddenly, it was not only Flat who wanted answers in her sister's murder.
*  There were dozens of others pushing for a resolution as well.
*  Then hundreds, and eventually, more than a thousand.
*  In November 2021, five months after the Facebook group was started,
*  Buchholz announced some movement in the case.
*  The Lubbock police had agreed to work with a new cold case unit at
*  the Texas Attorney General's office.
*  This means more investigators are now on board to find Debbie's killer, and
*  her case has been designated their top priority, Buchholz posted.
*  Then, presumably addressing the murderer, she added,
*  you ran for 46 years, but you can no longer hide.
*  By that point, Flat says she felt that she and Buchholz had become friends.
*  They talked regularly, mostly about the investigation, but sometimes,
*  at least in her memory of those conversations, about personal things.
*  Flat's kids or Buchholz's marriage.
*  But then in December, Buchholz started getting testy with her,
*  Flat says, and her reading of their relationship.
*  She wondered if the change had something to do with Buchholz and
*  Jared's announcement that they would be helping CrimeCon in one of its newest
*  ventures.
*  The company's online subscription service, Crime HQ,
*  was starting a series called Cold Case Club, which would stream live and
*  recorded Zoom presentations about murder investigations.
*  And they wanted a multi-part series on Debbie's case, led by Buchholz and Jared.
*  Buchholz told me via email that she had hoped participating in the Cold Case Club
*  would bring more attention to Debbie's murder.
*  In the process of preparing for those Zoom presentations, though,
*  she agreed to share Debbie's case file with a producer with the company.
*  When Flat found out, in a conversation with Buchholz less than a week before her
*  own Zoom interview, she was upset.
*  Their agreement, Flat told me, had been that Buchholz would not share the file
*  with anyone without her permission, in part because Flat worried that releasing
*  too much information might hurt a potential future arrest.
*  But Buchholz characterized their arrangement differently.
*  I did verbally say I would not publicize the file,
*  meaning I would not put it online where anyone and everyone could access it,
*  she wrote in an email.
*  I did not agree to never share it with anyone else.
*  Flat recorded the conversation she and
*  Buchholz had about the case file in late January 2022.
*  And listening to it, it seems clear that Buchholz knew Flat wouldn't be happy
*  about her sharing the file, but also that she believed it was the right decision,
*  if they wanted Debbie's case to progress, as she phrases it.
*  I'm not saying there aren't things you need to share, Flat says at one point.
*  I just want to know ahead of time, so I'm okay with it.
*  You would have said no, Buchholz responds, and
*  I wouldn't be able to do this for Debbie.
*  Please understand, we're doing everything that needs to be done to find this killer,
*  she adds later in that same conversation.
*  That is the goal, correct?
*  Not controlling everything?
*  Do you want us to find him or not?
*  Jen, Flat responds, I feel like you're manipulating this, and
*  I just need to stop and think without saying something I regret or
*  that's inappropriate, or that I'm just acting off emotions.
*  So I just need to kind of step back for a moment, and let's just talk later.
*  Buchholz says that Flat needs to trust her.
*  You said you would trust me, she repeats, almost pleading.
*  I did trust you, Flat says.
*  The fallout after that was quick.
*  Jared wrote Flat a long email explaining how much work he and
*  Buchholz had already put into the case and why she was wrong to be upset.
*  He asked whether she planned to appear on the upcoming Zoom presentation for
*  the Cold Case Club, or if he and Buchholz should use their backup plan.
*  Flat wrote that they should use that plan.
*  But after trying and failing to set up a time to talk over the disagreement with
*  Buchholz, Flat changed her mind.
*  On the day of the scheduled Zoom session, she asked to join after all.
*  Buchholz and Jared said no.
*  Buchholz told me in an email that they were unsure how Flat would act or
*  what she would say.
*  The session was titled A Sister's Fight for Answers, and
*  had been advertised as being about Flat's search to find Debbie's killer.
*  So when Flat learned she wouldn't be participating,
*  she decided to join as an audience member instead.
*  Buchholz later claimed that Flat was extremely disruptive
*  in the chat during that hour-long session, a characterization Flat disputes.
*  There is no available record of the Zoom chat.
*  When the presentation ended around 8 PM, Buchholz logged onto Facebook and
*  removed Flat as both an administrator and a member of her sister's group.
*  Flat said she was shocked when she received the removal email from Facebook.
*  And around that time, she began encouraging others, Doug and
*  representatives from the Cold Case Foundation,
*  to pull out from their scheduled Zoom interviews as well.
*  When they agreed, CrimeCon ended the series on Debbie's murder early,
*  citing significant discord between a member of Debbie's family and
*  the two case investigators.
*  Around that same time, Jared released a new episode of his podcast,
*  Diamond State Murder Board, with Buchholz as a guest.
*  The episode was titled Family Matters, and the opening description read,
*  sometimes the closest people to the case are the biggest obstacles to the truth.
*  Flat was in her backyard with her two dogs when she heard it.
*  She listened as Jared criticized her actions over the previous weeks, and
*  then as Buchholz agreed that Flat had seriously disrupted their investigation.
*  In military speak, said Buchholz,
*  who was also a former counterintelligence agent in the army,
*  this is an attempt at sabotage.
*  What started Flat crying, however, was what she heard next.
*  And here's the thing, she's not sabotaging you or me,
*  Jared said, she's sabotaging the case.
*  Yeah, Buchholz responded, her sister, her murdered sister.
*  And what goes through my head is, how would Debbie feel about this?
*  And I don't think she'd be very happy.
*  A couple of months later in April, Flat gave an interview to a Lubbock news
*  station in which she outlined some seemingly positive developments in
*  Debbie's case, namely that Sergeant Anderson had agreed to send evidence out for
*  advanced DNA testing to a private lab, but also critiques of Jared and Buchholz,
*  including that they had removed her from her sister's Facebook group.
*  Buchholz took to the group that same day.
*  I know this is circulating around, so I'm just going to post it,
*  she wrote before linking to Flat's interview.
*  If anyone on this group is in agreement with Liz's point of view on us,
*  please see yourself out of the group right now.
*  Some members left or were removed, but those who remained
*  seemed to have found the villain they had been searching for, Flat.
*  What a miserable person she is.
*  One of those members wrote in one of dozens of posts or
*  comments in that group about Flat.
*  She wants all focus on her not solving the murder.
*  This case, I hope, won't go cold again, but we will see.
*  If it does go cold again, Buchholz responded, there's only one person to blame.
*  Does Liz actually know who the killer is?
*  Someone else asked.
*  I thought the same thing, another member of the group responded.
*  Who's she protecting?
*  Last November, I flew to Dallas to meet with Flat and
*  a woman named Tiffany Ballard Moore,
*  the sister of Rebecca Gould, whose killer Buchholz and
*  Jared claimed to have helped find.
*  Vincent Strange, the Texas triad,
*  was the victim of a murder in the fall of 2000.
*  He was a former police officer, and
*  to have helped find.
*  Vincent Strange, the Texas True Crime podcaster, came as well.
*  He and Flat have become friends over the years.
*  She first reached out to him around the same time she and I got in touch in 2017.
*  I lived in Lubbock around that time and
*  had become fascinated by the story of Debbie's murder investigation.
*  Both the way it was initially mishandled by the police and
*  the frenzied attention it garnered in subsequent years.
*  I had been following Flat's story,
*  checking in with her about once a year for the past five years.
*  Now we were meeting outside of Panera Bread just off a highway in Denton
*  on a morning blanketed by rain clouds.
*  Flat arrived in an SUV, in the back of which she had two tubs,
*  one with a case file, which I had asked to look at, and
*  the other with fake flowers and brushes for
*  when she visited her mother's grave the following day.
*  Moore walked toward us while we were talking, in jeans and
*  bright white tennis shoes, her long brown hair slick straight.
*  She and Flat hugged.
*  It was their first time meeting in person.
*  They found each other only a few months earlier,
*  soon after they realized how much they had in common.
*  Moore was in her 20s when her sister was killed in 2004.
*  They had been living together in Fayetteville, Arkansas,
*  where Gould was enrolled in a local community college.
*  One weekend, Gould drove to nearby Melbourne, and she never returned.
*  Her body was found a week later on a hillside off a highway in Arkansas.
*  And although the police had suspects,
*  her case went unsolved for more than 15 years.
*  What eventually brought wider attention to the murder was a podcast called
*  Hell and Gone, which debuted in 2018 and
*  proposes that Gould's boyfriend may have killed her.
*  Soon after that, Buchholz got interested in the mystery too, and
*  she teamed up with Jared, who had covered the murder as a cub reporter in Arkansas.
*  Both zeroed in eventually on Gould's boyfriend as their primary suspect as well,
*  and chatter about him was common in the Facebook group Buchholz set up in
*  Gould's name in 2019.
*  But another occasional target in that group is Moore,
*  who refused to go on air with the Hell and Gone host,
*  Catherine Townsend, or later with Buchholz.
*  Moore also criticized them and Jared online for
*  casting suspicion on Gould's boyfriend,
*  who was interviewed by the police but never charged.
*  Members of Buchholz's Facebook group wrote that Moore didn't actually want to
*  see her sister's murder solved.
*  They wrote that she had obstructed justice, and
*  at least one of them called her a bag of trash.
*  People think it's a movie, Moore said, once we all had coffee and
*  pastries and had found a table inside.
*  I don't think people think logically when they get into those groups.
*  They think the absolute worst.
*  Before she met Flat,
*  Moore said she rarely talked with others about the Facebook group.
*  She worried that people wouldn't believe her.
*  Even after it turned out she had been right to defend her sister's boyfriend.
*  In 2020, the police arrested a man named William Miller for
*  Rebecca Gould's murder.
*  Afterward, Buchholz and Jared and also Townsend claimed that their
*  efforts had helped the police close the case.
*  Either by putting pressure on them to investigate or, in the case of Buchholz
*  and Jared, by realizing that Miller was a member of Gould's Facebook group.
*  But the officer who identified and arrested Miller,
*  special agent Mike McNeil, told me that just isn't true.
*  He was assigned Gould's case after the former detective on it announced his
*  retirement, he said, and he found Miller through his own process of elimination.
*  Moore and Flat found each other two years later.
*  Soon after Buchholz and Jared made that podcast about the difficulties of working
*  with families of victims.
*  The podcast mentions Moore as well, just not by name.
*  Flat said sometimes Moore would call her up and sound at peace.
*  Miller had pleaded guilty to her sister's murder, and
*  Moore attended his sentencing hearing earlier that fall.
*  He apologized for what he did, and is now in prison, sentenced to 40 years.
*  Flat felt as if Moore had everything that she still sought,
*  closure, justice, and an end to her search.
*  But other times, Moore would call Flat distraught.
*  And it was always about something that happened with Buchholz and Jared,
*  who also attended Miller's sentencing hearing, and who wrote and
*  posted and released podcasts about it online.
*  In the Facebook group, they and others still suspected Gould's boyfriend of
*  playing some part in the murder.
*  Miller was his cousin, even though McNeil has made it clear that the boyfriend
*  had nothing to do with it.
*  They have continued to criticize Moore as well, for her appearance on a Dateline
*  episode about Gould more recently, and during Miller's sentencing,
*  for not putting flowers on her sister's grave, as Buchholz and Jared did that day.
*  The reason she didn't, Moore told us that morning,
*  was because she had taken her younger sister Danielle to the hearing.
*  And Danielle was on her fourth round of chemotherapy at the time, and
*  needed to go home and rest.
*  Danielle died this year.
*  It's so frustrating, Moore said.
*  And honestly, that type of stuff is what gets me going and
*  makes me where I'm like, like they're not going to stop.
*  Flat said, as Moore searched for words.
*  The two women said they feel as if the stories being spun about them and
*  the crowds that have built up around their sisters won't disappear anytime soon.
*  Debbie's husband, Doug, would later tell me that he has tried to avoid talking with
*  his adult daughter about Debbie's murder because he supports Flat,
*  whom he can still remember as an eight-year-old.
*  And his daughter is a member of Debbie's Facebook group and
*  has been impressed by much of Buchholz and Jared's investigation.
*  Moore's father, from whom she is estranged, supports Buchholz and Jared as well.
*  And details of their strained family dynamics,
*  Moore's parents divorced when she was young,
*  have also been at times part of the chatter on Gould's Facebook group.
*  I shouldn't care about what people think about me, but I do.
*  Moore told me in a quiet voice at one point.
*  I think that's why the things that they say hurt.
*  On Facebook, meanwhile, Buchholz and
*  Jared have argued that Moore started the fight by criticizing their investigation
*  publicly, and that Flat has been going after them, not the other way around.
*  Buchholz has also made the case that no family member can or
*  should control a murder investigation, and
*  that the general public too has stakes in a murder's being solved.
*  Flat and Moore talked at the Panera Bread for
*  more than three hours that morning as it rained off and on.
*  They traded ideas for how to address their shared problem,
*  including defamation lawsuits and signing contracts with podcasters or
*  private investigators about what information can or cannot be released.
*  But they also talked about their sisters, who they were, and
*  what they were like when they were still a part of this world.
*  Flat brought out photos of Debbie,
*  along with letters her parents had written during their search to see her murder solved.
*  Moore told us about her and Gould's silly fights over clothes, and
*  mid-sentence, she began to cry.
*  You've already gone through trauma, and then they put you through more trauma.
*  Moore reassured Flat at one point,
*  after Flat confessed that sometimes she feels like giving up.
*  And you shouldn't have to go through that.
*  Nobody should have to go through anything like that.
*  I just pray, and it's like, God, what am I supposed to do?
*  Flat said, what am I supposed to do?
*  Debbie, talk to me and direct me.
*  What am I supposed to do?
*  What she eventually did was push the police to test any final evidence in
*  Debbie's case, and six months after we all met up in Denton,
*  Flat returned to where this story began, Lubbock, Texas,
*  to witness the exhumation of her sister's remains.
*  I flew out to join her, and at sunrise on a Wednesday in May,
*  I was at the cemetery where Debbie was buried nearly 50 years earlier.
*  Flat and her son, Matt Bentley,
*  picked me up at the funeral home in his white pickup truck, and
*  we drove together to the grave site.
*  The plan, she told me earlier,
*  was to unearth Debbie's coffin in search of viable DNA samples,
*  her own and also potentially those of whoever killed her.
*  Debbie's grave was staked off already when we parked amid a line of mostly
*  unmarked police cars at the grass's edge.
*  We stood along the cemetery lawn,
*  watching a backhoe pull earth from the ground.
*  Then we waded into the graveyard toward Debbie's headstone.
*  Flat told me she slept restlessly the night before,
*  as much out of concern for what would happen today.
*  Was it right to dig up her sister's body?
*  She kept asking herself.
*  Would that bring her the answers she sought?
*  As out of fear about what those from the Facebook group would do or
*  say once they learned that Debbie had been exhumed.
*  The backhoe shuddered to a stop, and two workers from the funeral home jumped
*  into the grave with shovels to dig out the rest of the earth by hand.
*  Flat held onto her son's arm and
*  watched them while her other hand trembled almost imperceptibly.
*  A couple of weeks earlier, Flat's older sister Paula Chasse,
*  from her father's side of the family,
*  told me that the main hope she had now was not that Debbie's case would one day
*  be solved, a goal that feels less and less realistic, but
*  that Flat would be able to let it go.
*  Liz has been torn apart, she said.
*  I feel bad for her, but I wish she could just walk away.
*  Bentley told me that he urged his mom the night before to accept that she had
*  done what she could for her sister.
*  He was convinced that she heard him and
*  that this would be her last attempt to see Debbie's case solved.
*  It was also, from what I gathered talking to a forensic anthropologist present at
*  the exhumation, one containing only the slimmest chance that any useful
*  evidence would be found.
*  And weeks later, Flat would also learn that the answers from the DNA analysis,
*  if they come, could take much longer than she expected.
*  Possibly years, though the police say hopefully months.
*  That morning in Lubbock, though, Flat felt that at least something was being done.
*  She stood in the sun beside Bentley and the dozen or so police officers,
*  including Sergeant Anderson and a couple of victims' advocates.
*  And we watched as the funeral home workers laid their shovels aside and
*  began to rest Debbie's vault from the ground.
*  We watched as they hauled that vault onto a tractor bed and
*  drove it to a drafty warehouse nearby, where it was pried open to reveal
*  Debbie's coffin, pale green with emblazoned silver flowers.
*  And then as that coffin, its latch rusted shut, had to be pried opened as well.
*  We watched as a forensic specialist placed samples from Debbie's body,
*  her hair, her fingernails, part of a bone, into individually labeled envelopes
*  on a wooden table beside the coffin, spilling rainwater onto a concrete floor.
*  Then all of us except for one officer and Flat's son,
*  stepped out of the warehouse to give Flat time to say goodbye once more to her sister, Debbie.
*  It was a decision Flat would later tell me she regretted.
*  She said goodbye to Debbie at that cemetery when she was eight.
*  The body at rest in her coffin was no longer her sister, she knew that.
*  And facing her remains only showed her how much time had passed,
*  how long that dirt had been settled, how impossible return really is.
*  No matter if this particular mystery is one day solved or not.
