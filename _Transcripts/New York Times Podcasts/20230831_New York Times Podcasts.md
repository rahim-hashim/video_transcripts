# A Major Overhaul of Prescription Drug Prices
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnNyt9QExy4)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  A year ago, Congress overhauled the way drugs for older Americans get paid for by giving
*  Medicare, the power to bargain with drug makers, over prices.
*  It was the biggest change in health care in more than a decade.
*  This week, the Biden administration began to implement it.
*  My colleagues Sheryl Stolberg on the decades-long battle to get that power, and Rebecca Robbins
*  on its potential to reshape the business of drugs in America.
*  It's Thursday, August 31st.
*  So Sheryl, there's a very big change underway with Medicare, which is of course the government
*  health insurance program for older Americans.
*  And I immediately thought of you, my former DC colleague and longtime health care policy
*  reporter.
*  Tell me what's going on.
*  So the administration announced its plans to have Medicare negotiate directly with drug
*  for the first time ever over the price of medicines to basically bargain them down.
*  So it's going to start kind of small.
*  The White House announced 10 drugs.
*  These are drugs for diabetes and stroke and heart disease and arthritis and cancer, whose
*  prices will be subject to Medicare negotiations.
*  It's really a paradigm shift and it opens the door toward more and more drugs being
*  subject to price negotiations.
*  And it's a huge deal.
*  It's the biggest change to the health care system in this country since the passage of
*  the Affordable Care Act in 2010.
*  And what's the goal here?
*  So the goal is pretty simple.
*  It's to lower drug prices.
*  Drugs pay the highest drug prices of anywhere in the developed world.
*  There was a study by the Rand Corporation that found that drug prices in the United
*  States are two and a half times those of comparable countries.
*  OK, so help us understand why this is such a shift, Cheryl.
*  Like, how had Medicare functioned up until now when it comes to prescription drugs?
*  So it might be hard to remember, but for much of Medicare's history, there was no
*  coverage of prescription drugs.
*  Older people would go broke paying for their medicine.
*  There were these horror stories of people choosing between food and drugs.
*  And I actually asked my own mom yesterday, what did you do before Medicare covered drugs?
*  And she said, we just paid for them out of pocket.
*  She said my dad had been on chemotherapy and they were paying $300 a pill.
*  And they were on cholesterol drugs and they had figured out a way to get them from Canada
*  where it was cheaper.
*  So this was how Medicare functioned for decades.
*  When did it become part of the political debate?
*  So it really became a big part of the political debate in 2000 when Al Gore was running against
*  George Bush for the presidency.
*  And Gore, who was vice president, was just railing against the drug companies and making
*  a big push.
*  It's embarrassing that we have senior citizens getting on buses and going to Canada in order
*  to get more affordable prescription drugs.
*  Gore wanted the government to do something about this.
*  He wanted to expand Medicare to cover drugs.
*  It is long past time to take on the big drug companies and say it is time for a prescription
*  drug benefit for all seniors under the Medicare program.
*  All seniors.
*  So on the campaign trail, Gore was just hammering Bush about this.
*  My opponent is supported by the HMOs and the insurance companies and the big drug companies
*  and he has taken their position opposing these measures.
*  And Bush was coming back and saying, well, wait a minute, you know, we've got a plan
*  too.
*  I mean, we need to have a modern system to help seniors.
*  But our plan isn't a government plan.
*  Our plan is a private plan.
*  We want to rely on private insurance companies to sell drug coverage policies to older people.
*  And the idea of supporting a federally controlled 132,000 page document bureaucracy as being
*  a compassionate way for seniors is just not my vision.
*  I believe we ought to give seniors more options.
*  I believe we ought to make the system work better.
*  And it would be backed by kind of government subsidies and incentives.
*  So both parties really agreed that something had to be done.
*  Let me ask you both this and we'll move on on this subject.
*  As a practical matter, both of you want to bring prescription drugs to seniors, correct?
*  Correct.
*  But they were just fighting over how to do it.
*  The difference is I want to bring it to 100 percent.
*  And he brings it only to 5 percent.
*  That's just totally false.
*  Wait a minute, it's just totally false.
*  OK, so Bush, of course, gets elected.
*  What does he do with his campaign promise?
*  So I was covering this at the time.
*  And what Bush did was he decided that he was going to kind of leave it up to Congress to
*  come up with the details.
*  And then we suddenly had a political alignment not seen since the 1950s.
*  Republicans were in charge of the White House, the House, and the Senate.
*  And this issue, drug prices, was pending before them at the request of the president.
*  Got it.
*  So Republicans had total control of all branches of government.
*  So effectively, the go ahead for this potential policy that Bush had in mind.
*  Well, Republicans might have had control of everything, but they didn't have the votes
*  to pass the private kind of plan that most of them would have wanted.
*  So there were a lot of negotiations, a lot of back and forth.
*  And one of the key drivers of this debate was this Louisiana congressman named Billy
*  Towson.
*  The gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Towson.
*  Thank you, Ms. Chairman.
*  Let me first acknowledge that this is an historic meeting of the House and Senate on what has
*  become an issue to so many senior citizens across the country.
*  He was kind of a point man, if you will.
*  He was chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and he had a huge role in drafting
*  this legislation.
*  And if we miss that opportunity because we failed to come together in agreement and give
*  the president a chance to sign a bill, shame on us.
*  But there was a big stumbling block.
*  President Bush is urging Congress to pass a Medicare prescription drug bill, but deep
*  divisions remain on Capitol Hill.
*  The House bill relies much more heavily on private insurance plans that would compete
*  directly with traditional Medicare.
*  Democrats opposed it vehemently.
*  Boy, do they have a prescription for you.
*  Further weakening the foundation of Medicare for the seniors who need it most.
*  You know, GOP used to stand for Grand Old Party.
*  Now it stands for Get Old People.
*  I'm offended that anyone would come to this floor and accuse anyone in this House of wanting
*  to get old people.
*  Do you think for a second you love your moms and dads any more than we love ours?
*  That's a sort of unstated gift.
*  So what happens is through negotiations back and forth, they come up with this plan for
*  Medicare to actually expand to cover prescription drugs.
*  But there's a catch.
*  And the catch is that there is what they call the non-interference clause.
*  What's that mean?
*  The non-interference clause, which the drug companies desperately wanted, explicitly barred
*  the federal government from directly negotiating drug prices with the pharmaceutical manufacturers.
*  So it means effectively that the government is providing this benefit with one hand tied
*  behind its back because it can't use its bargaining power to drive down prices.
*  So you've got this kind of sprawling system of individual insurers who could bargain with
*  the companies.
*  But Medicare as a whole couldn't do it.
*  This big, giant agency that was responsible for ensuring millions and millions of Americans,
*  they couldn't get together and bargain as one.
*  Yeah.
*  And the drug industry wanted nothing to do with having the government negotiate their
*  prices.
*  The drug industry has a lot of lobbyists.
*  Some people will tell you they have three lobbyists for every member of Congress.
*  The members of Congress are elected, but the lobbyists have a certain degree of power.
*  So essentially the plan they came up with ended up being all carrot and no stick effectively,
*  right?
*  I mean, the government is saying to drug makers, here you go.
*  Here's a massive new pool of customers.
*  But we can't use any of our clout as this giant drug buyer, right?
*  This 800 pound gorilla that is Medicare to demand lower prices.
*  So American taxpayers end up footing this really big new bill.
*  That's exactly right.
*  So it seems like a big giveaway to the drug industry.
*  Okay.
*  So this was the proposal that Tauzin landed on.
*  What did his colleagues in Congress think of it?
*  Well, it satisfied some Republicans, but not enough.
*  There was a lot of pushback within the party.
*  This would be the biggest new federal entitlement since 1965 when Medicare was created.
*  Conservative Republicans didn't like the idea of a major expansion of a government program,
*  much less an entitlement program like Medicare.
*  Let us not in this Congress today sow the seeds to destroy the foundation of a free
*  market system.
*  Nonetheless, the bill comes to a vote.
*  And in the wee hours of the morning in November 2003, they actually started the roll call
*  vote at 3 a.m. after a lot of back and forth debate and nervousness about whether or not
*  this thing was going to pass.
*  The quarter vote is ordered.
*  The yeas and nays are ordered.
*  This will be a 15 minute vote.
*  It was supposed to be a 15 minute vote.
*  Instead, it took hours.
*  Wow.
*  You're watching live coverage of the U.S. House of Representatives on C-SPAN.
*  This vote started at 3 a.m. Eastern about an hour and 20 minutes ago.
*  Bush was calling Republicans from Air Force One.
*  Any other members wish to change their votes?
*  Dick Cheney came to twist arms on the House floor.
*  My goodness.
*  This took Franks of Arizona and Otter.
*  It went on so long that some members of Congress actually fell asleep.
*  I mean, it was 3 a.m. after all.
*  Right.
*  The vote didn't close until 6 in the morning.
*  On this vote, the yeas are 220 and nays are 215.
*  The conference is agreed to.
*  Without objection, the motion to reach a kidney is laid upon the table.
*  Morning.
*  Thanks for the warm welcome.
*  And then.
*  In a few moments, I will have the honor.
*  Shortly thereafter, on December 8, 2003.
*  Of signing an historic act of Congress into law.
*  President Bush signs this landmark legislation into law.
*  I'm pleased that all of you are here to witness the greatest advance in health care coverage
*  for America's seniors since the founding of Medicare.
*  And he said that this bill is, quote, the greatest advance in health care coverage for
*  America's seniors since the founding of Medicare.
*  So what does it look like for Medicare patients once this program is fully launched?
*  So it's a huge relief, a big win for Medicare patients, but it wasn't perfect.
*  They still had to pay premiums and out of pocket co-pays and prices continued to go
*  up.
*  From 2009 to 2018, the average price of brand name drugs for Medicare more than doubled.
*  So people were really still feeling the pinch.
*  And this just added to the public perception that, you know, pharma had a lock on Washington.
*  And there was this feeling, I remember, Cheryl, I was covering public health at the time of,
*  you know, why isn't the government doing something about this?
*  These prices are crazy.
*  You know, how can this be possible?
*  So what changes?
*  Bring me to the next moment.
*  So in 2016, Donald Trump, of all people, was talking about this.
*  We're the largest purchaser of drugs in the world, the United States by far.
*  We don't bid.
*  He was really taking on the drug industry and he was making it a campaign issue.
*  He was saying that it was crazy that the government couldn't make a deal.
*  Because the politicians that I'm running against and others are getting tremendous campaign
*  contributions from the pharmaceutical industry, the drug industry.
*  And they don't want to have bidding.
*  And then he continued talking about this once he got into office.
*  Therefore, today I'm signing four sweeping executive orders that will lead to massive
*  reduction in drug costs.
*  Massive.
*  And in fact, toward the end of his presidency, he issued an executive order that would tie
*  prescription drug prices in the United States to those in other developed countries.
*  The pharmaceutical industry was apoplectic, but it was an executive order, which is basically
*  an order that the president issues.
*  Unlike legislation, it doesn't have the authority of Congress and it didn't really change much,
*  but it certainly put the issue back on the table.
*  So in some way, Trump kind of takes away Republicans' cover on this issue, right?
*  I mean, Trump, the populist, showed that the traditional Republican position on this was
*  not actually a view held by a large part of the Republican base.
*  People wanted the government to take action on prices.
*  Right.
*  And polling showed a vast majority of Americans wanted the government to take some kind of
*  action.
*  And so this opened a conversation among Republicans, but more importantly, Biden gets elected and
*  the House and the Senate are in Democratic hands.
*  So now he's got the climate to do something about this.
*  Right.
*  And he and the Democrats in Congress put this change, this provision, to allow Medicare
*  to negotiate drug prices.
*  They put it in this sprawling bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, which tackled climate change
*  and a lot of other things.
*  And it said that by September 1st, 2023, the government shall announce the first 10 drugs
*  to be subject to Medicare price negotiations.
*  So that's exactly what the Biden administration did.
*  It is my greatest honor to introduce the man responsible for all these incredible changes,
*  President Joe Biden.
*  Biden comes to the White House.
*  Unless you needed the drugs yourself or knew someone who did, it wasn't as real.
*  But boy, we've been fighting big pharma for a long time.
*  And he says, this has been a long time coming.
*  Today is the start of a new deal for patients where big pharma doesn't just get a blank
*  check at your expense and the expense of the American people.
*  And you know, we've finally taken on big pharma and we're not going to back down.
*  On my watch, healthcare should be right, not a privilege in this country.
*  But I have to say, Sabrina, the drug industry is not going down without a fight.
*  And the actual mechanics of how this will affect the pocketbooks of ordinary Americans
*  is a lot more complicated than the president suggested at the White House on Tuesday.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Rebecca, I just talked to our colleague, Sheryl Stolberg, and she told me the whole
*  backstory of how this new change to Medicare came to be, where, you know, the government
*  will start to now negotiate the prices of some drugs.
*  And because you cover the pharmaceutical industry, I wanted to talk to you about how
*  this is all going to play out in terms of dollars and cents and really what this will
*  mean for consumers and for the industry.
*  So to start with, can you tell us what drugs the government is targeting?
*  Yeah, so the government put out a list of 10 drugs that are going to be subject to
*  negotiation. And these are products that are made by some of the biggest pharmaceutical
*  companies in the world. Bristol, Meyer, Squibb, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, all household
*  names. And the Biden administration devised the list based on a very specific set of
*  criteria. They weren't making arbitrary choices about which products they wanted to be
*  on the list. It was really based on a process that took into account a number of different
*  factors.
*  And what factors were they taking into account?
*  For one, the products had to be widely used drugs that
*  account for a lot of Medicare spending.
*  So we're talking drugs that target conditions that affect
*  older people predominantly.
*  One example is the blood thinner, Eloquis, which prevents strokes and blood clots
*  that was taken in the past year by three point seven million people on Medicare.
*  So really, they're targeting drugs that are in heavy rotation in the American population.
*  And that makes sense in terms of bang for the buck, right?
*  It's a way to lessen the cost for the government.
*  Are there other criteria that they're considering?
*  So the drugs to be eligible for negotiation have to have been on the market for a number
*  of years. They're trying to target drugs at a very specific moment.
*  They're trying to hit the sweet spot when they've been on the market long enough for
*  the drug maker to make a tidy profit, but not so late that there's already generic
*  competition. So it's kind of a Goldilocks phenomenon.
*  Not too early, not too late.
*  Right. And the idea behind that is that they want to give drug makers the opportunity
*  to make money off of their innovation, to encourage risk taking, to encourage investment
*  in expensive clinical trials.
*  But they don't want to wait so long that the drug has already started facing generic
*  competition because in theory that competition would drive down the price.
*  So there wouldn't be as much of a point of having Medicare negotiate lower prices.
*  So, Rebecca, how do you think this is going to affect Medicare patients?
*  I mean, are they going to start paying less for their medications?
*  So the government is the big winner here in terms of savings because the government
*  carries most of the burden of paying for the drugs that are taken by Medicare patients.
*  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the government will save nearly 100
*  billion dollars over a decade.
*  But if the government's paying less, that can ultimately have trickle down effects for
*  patients and patients pay for their drugs in the form of paying insurance premiums
*  and paying out of pocket costs when they pick up a prescription at the pharmacy.
*  And the idea is that if Medicare is saving money on these drugs, premiums will go down
*  and patients will pay less out of pocket.
*  Premiums will go down because premium is a portion of the drug cost, right?
*  And the portion will be lower because the cost is lower.
*  That's right. And there's also another part of the Biden administration's effort to
*  tackle drug prices. And that's a cap on the money that Medicare patients have to pay
*  out of pocket when they pick up prescriptions at the pharmacy counter.
*  Starting in 2025, the yearly spending will be capped at two thousand dollars per
*  patient. Wow. That's presumably much lower than many patients had been spending.
*  That's right. That can make a huge difference financially for many patients.
*  And experts are saying that the Medicare negotiation savings may ultimately help fund
*  that cap on out of pocket costs.
*  Interesting. So in a way, it could be actually quite direct, but through the savings that
*  comes from the bargaining. That's right.
*  And remember, it's still really early days in this process.
*  The negotiated prices under the program won't take effect until 2026.
*  So that's the first year that the government would be seeing savings.
*  And it's also the very first step in what's going to turn out to be an annual process
*  each year. The government will add new drugs to the list, while some drugs will fall off
*  the list because generic competition has reached the market.
*  OK, so that's Medicare.
*  But how do we expect this to affect the rest of the health care system like everybody
*  else? Like, say, I'm not on Medicare.
*  Will this affect me?
*  So in theory, this program has no impact on the prices paid for medications taken by
*  privately insured people.
*  That said, in practice, it may open the door for lower prices in the private market, too.
*  And that's because of a peculiarity in the way that drug prices are negotiated.
*  So the way that drug pricing works is it's kept secret.
*  The prices that different customers pay when you account for discounts and rebates are
*  ultimately kept confidential.
*  So let's walk through a hypothetical.
*  If I'm a drug manufacturer making, say, an arthritis drug, I'm ultimately charging
*  different prices to different customers.
*  And my different customers don't know how much the others are paying.
*  OK. And when Medicare's lower prices are made public, that adds a new lever for
*  the buyers. They'll be in a position where they can say, I want this same discount.
*  And if not, I will just withdraw my business, especially in a class like arthritis
*  drugs. There are a lot of other options.
*  And that's something that these buyers can use to their advantage.
*  So it basically gives buyers a kind of baseline for a negotiating position, right?
*  Something to point to and ask for.
*  Suddenly, they have these x-ray glasses, if you will.
*  And now that they have that power, you know, if I'm the buyer, I can go to some other
*  drug on the market that fills the same need, because there are a lot of them.
*  That's right. Even though we're talking about drugs that are under-patent and don't
*  have generic competition, there are other options, other drugs available that fill
*  the same need. OK, so this could lead to savings for Medicare and for private
*  insurance. But obviously, this money is coming from somewhere, right?
*  So what do we expect is going to happen to the pharma industry as a result?
*  So the drug industry has been fighting the Medicare negotiation program.
*  The pharmaceutical company known as Merck has filed a lawsuit against the federal
*  government following the...
*  They've filed lawsuits trying to block the Biden administration from implementing
*  it. Saying that being forced to negotiate drug prices with Medicare is, quote,
*  tantamount to extortion.
*  Arguing that, quote, the program takes property for public use without just
*  compensation. And they've warned that if it's implemented, it will have unintended
*  consequences that could really harm patients.
*  Drug manufacturers say it will result in loss of profits that will force them to
*  pull back on developing groundbreaking new treatments.
*  They're saying it will lead to fewer cures.
*  It will lead to delays in patients getting certain medications.
*  It will discourage companies from developing the kinds of medications that are
*  important and widely used by seniors.
*  And, Rebecca, what do you make of those claims?
*  The things the industry is arguing, how much water do they actually hold?
*  So I think one thing we know from health policy is that new laws will create new
*  incentives and for-profit companies are going to act accordingly to try to preserve
*  their profits. And I do think the devil's in the details in terms of how this
*  legislation was written.
*  So notably, it discourages companies from developing the old school synthetic
*  drugs, the traditional pill you're most familiar with, and encourages them to
*  develop the more expensive living cell drugs that dominate the list of most
*  expensive medications today.
*  So in a way, in a kind of unexpected way, this could lead to more development of
*  more expensive drugs.
*  That's certainly possible. I think the way in which the drug industry responds to
*  this new marketplace will dictate whether the goals of the program will ultimately
*  be realized. But I think beyond just the dollars and cents involved, there's
*  something bigger happening here.
*  And this is, I think, why this is such an important news story, because there's a
*  really fundamental shift taking place here in how prices are set in the United
*  States. It's opening a door that until now had ultimately been shut.
*  We're starting with just this list of 10 initial products, but the introduction of
*  negotiation in this very limited slice of the market could ultimately lead to other
*  huge changes. It could open the door for the government to start negotiating drugs
*  earlier in the lifecycle of these products, when manufacturers have had fewer
*  years enjoying a monopoly.
*  It might ultimately lead to legislation that would mandate the same process in the
*  private market. So I think this is a really fundamental shift in the way that drug
*  pricing works in the United States.
*  And we're in really uncharted waters.
*  Right. It's not just a list of 10 drugs.
*  It's the beginning of a whole new process.
*  The government actually changing its relationship to the pharmaceutical industry, in
*  a way, opening from pharma's perspective, this Pandora's box.
*  That's right. And this is a big part of the reason the drug industry has fought this
*  program so hard.
*  It's a real existential threat to their core of their business model, which really
*  hinges on extremely high prices relative to the rest of the world in the United
*  States. I think another point that's important is that the drug industry is
*  important here is that the Medicare negotiation program is really an experiment.
*  And it's shaping up to be a test of the argument that the drug industry is making,
*  that the sky will fall if Medicare has the ability to negotiate the prices of
*  drugs. If we see that the sky does not fall, that the drug industry continues to
*  remain profitable and produce cures and the lower prices take effect, well, then
*  we'll have our answer.
*  And that's an answer that will ripple throughout the American health care system.
*  Rebecca, thank you.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  This is the thick of it. We are in the middle of it right now.
*  You can hear that roar.
*  Oh, here we go. Oh, it's the house.
*  Oh, oh, my gosh.
*  The whole roof just came off the house, Mike.
*  Edalia, the first storm to Pommel, Florida, this season, made landfall as a

*  It inundated coastal villages carrying rain and storm surge with winds near 125
*  miles per hour. But by late Wednesday afternoon, it had weakened to a tropical
