*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro. This is Adelaide.
*  As a racketeering trial begins in Atlanta, much of the focus is on the high-profile
*  defendant, the best-selling rapper, Young Thug. But as my colleague, Joe Costgarelli
*  explains, in a very real sense, hip hop itself is on trial.
*  It's Tuesday, December 5.
*  The end of the year.
*  Joe, tell us about this trial that began last week in Atlanta.
*  This is a crazy trial. You've probably heard of Fanny Willis. She's the district attorney
*  in Fulton County, which covers a lot of Atlanta. And she's become a national figure
*  over the last few months, largely because she brought a criminal racketeering case or RICO.
*  It's more commonly known against President Trump and his allies like Rudy Giuliani.
*  Right. We've covered it extensively on the show.
*  Right. And that's about their efforts in Georgia, specifically to overturn the presidential election
*  in 2020. She's using that same legal strategy against criminal street gangs.
*  And one in particular, she says, is run by Young Thug or Jeffrey Williams, who's one of the most
*  successful and influential rappers of his time. And that's what puts him in your world because you
*  are a music writer at the time. Yes. I have been covering music here for 10 years. And because
*  of that timing, that means I've covered a lot of rap music. We are in an era where hip hop is
*  the most popular genre in the country and probably the world. And Atlanta is really its beating heart
*  and has been for a long time. I wrote a book called Rap Capital about the city of Atlanta.
*  And I spent a lot of time in Atlanta with rappers and specifically in Cleveland Avenue,
*  which is the neighborhood that Young Thug and his friends and collaborators and associates come from.
*  Okay. So let's start with the man at the center of this Fonney Willis prosecution, Young Thug. Tell
*  us what we need to know about him. Young Thug was born Jeffrey Williams in the south of Atlanta.
*  He comes from the Jonesboro housing projects, which was a notoriously rough place to grow up.
*  He's the 10th of 11 children. And starting about a decade ago,
*  he begins to make a name for himself as one in a long line of rap innovators from Atlanta,
*  like Andre 3000 from Outcast, with songs like Pikachu and Stona.
*  And in 2012, 2013, 2014, he's really pushing the limits of what you could dress like,
*  what you could sound like, you could sing and be a rapper.
*  And Young Thug sort of takes that baton and he carries it for the city, starting with a collection
*  of very strange, very experimental songs.
*  His lyrics are quite abstract a lot of the time. And his voice is magical in a lot of ways.
*  And for a while, he's a bit of an internet curio. People don't know if he's good for hip-hop.
*  At one point, he puts on a dress. And this is really messing with the machismo of the gangster rapper.
*  And then years later, he says, in fact, I was wearing the dress because I was hiding a machine gun underneath.
*  So that's really the two sides of Young Thug. He's a bit of a prince-like figure.
*  And I mean, prince the musician. He sounds like people who came before him, but then all mutated and even weirder.
*  And along the way, people really take to this stuff. He becomes an extremely popular musician.
*  And in Atlanta, he becomes a figurehead and somebody who can choose who gets to make it next.
*  Huh.
*  And he starts this collective that he calls YSL.
*  As in the famous French fashion red.
*  It's definitely a reference to that, but some people say it stands for Young Stoner Life,
*  Young Slime Life, or in some cases, Young Successful Life.
*  And up under this collective YSL, led by Young Thug,
*  come a few more successful rappers, some of whom are his friends growing up in his old neighborhood.
*  And some of whom he just plays talent scout and plucks them from other neighborhoods in the city.
*  But he's really, really a leader of hip-hop in the place that often leads to the conversation about rap in America.
*  In short, things are going extremely well for him. So what happens next?
*  Young Thug starts to cross over into the mainstream.
*  Now, he's working with pop singers. He's on this Camila Cabello song from 2017 called Havana.
*  This song hits number one on the Billboard Hot 100, which is the All Jean-Rachart.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  And then all of a sudden, Young Thug is a superstar. He's in fashion magazines. He's playing, you know,
*  late night, which is me Fallon.
*  Performing fate from Creed to the album. Give it up for Mike Will,
*  made it Swaley and Young Thug.
*  He has a number one album on his own called So Much Fun in 2019.
*  But he really becomes this figure who functions like any other mainstream pop star,
*  even though he's seemingly breaking all the rules.
*  Musical. At the same time, during his rise, he's developing a bit of a reputation as an outlaw,
*  a bad boy, which, you know, is quite storied in hip-hop, you think of someone like Tupac or like
*  50 Cent. And their extracurricular struggles are a big part of what people love about their
*  music and their persona. And so along the way, as Young Thug's finding all of this commercial success,
*  he's also running into trouble with the law. He gets arrested here and there on drug and gun
*  charges. He's accused of threatening security guard at the mall one time. And none of this stuff
*  really is resolved in court. It just seems to go away. And he just keeps finding more and more
*  success in music. In the fall of 2021, he's on Saturday Night Live.
*  Once again, Young Thug.
*  And he's with his protege, Ghana, who's becoming almost as popular as he is. They play the song Love
*  You More. And it feels like they're on top of the world and they're only getting bigger.
*  And then on May 9th, 2022, the entire music world is shocked when Fanny Willis' office in
*  Fulton County drops a huge indictment against Young Thug and YSL, his rap crew.
*  It is our allegation that they operated as a criminal street gang and commits to do havoc in
*  our community. And what exactly is the accusation of the indictment? Obviously it involves
*  racketeering Rico, but specifically what's the case being made?
*  Fanny Willis' office in Fulton County is alleging that Young Thug, Jeffrey Williams, is the head of YSL,
*  which was not only a rap collective, but a criminal street gang terrorizing the streets of Atlanta.
*  And specifically the Cleveland Avenue neighborhood where Young Thug grew up.
*  I believe that people in that neighborhood and that every corner of Fulton County deserve to be safe,
*  even if it is financially lower, socially, economically. I don't think that that
*  belief part of the community should be left behind.
*  And terrorizing how according to the indictment. The prosecutors say that YSL was a subset of the
*  national bloods that functioned with Williams as its leader and that he oversaw crimes like murder,
*  attempted murder, armed robbery, witness intimidation, drug dealing, and more.
*  That Cleveland in our community is referred to as Believerland, that it is somewhere where
*  just violence occurs where they are marking up territories, blood territory is horrible.
*  And basically that this group which does produce music and is a hugely successful
*  physical operation is also a criminal operation, a gang.
*  And not only that, but that they are using the music to promote the gang.
*  How?
*  By using the music to advertise the gang essentially, to flaunt just how scary and successful they are.
*  It's a really kind of shocking accusation.
*  Completely. And it sort of turns on its head the idea of gangs that we are used to as a culture.
*  Just explain that.
*  Traditionally we think of the bloods and the crypts and these West Coast gangs that were such a big
*  part of popular culture in the 1980s and 90s as these hierarchical organizations where people on
*  the street commit crimes to make money. They fight over territory for drug dealing or robberies.
*  And that money works its way up a pyramid.
*  What Fanny Willis and her office is saying is that young thugs success as a rapper in fact allowed
*  him to control people underneath him and to fund their illegal exploits as opposed to their drug
*  dealing funding him. Fascinating. It's a reversal. He, the rap artist is underwriting a gang.
*  There are little accusations of drug dealing and robbery and stuff in here, but they're not saying
*  that this was the main business. They're saying that rap was the main business and the gang was just
*  bolstering its reputation through both the crimes and the music. What did you make of
*  that set of claims when you heard them? And what did everybody else in hip-hop make of them?
*  I think for a lot of people who follow rap music very closely like myself, you sort of know that
*  there's this connection to potentially a criminal underworld. This has been inextricable in the
*  genre throughout its history. And in many ways what these artists are selling is authenticity. They're
*  documenting where they come from and who they are. But what this indictment was saying was like,
*  what if this rap is too real?
*  And we're going to see that all play out in court.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Joe, bring us into the courtroom as this unusual trial gets underway over the past few days.
*  This trial was originally going to include 28 defendants, including young Thug. Over the last
*  year plus, a lot of those people have taken guilty pleas. Some of the cases have been severed. So
*  young Thug, Jeffrey Williams is currently being tried alongside five other individuals.
*  And that seems notable because plea deals in a racketeering case usually are very bad news for
*  the percent at the top of the case, which in this case is young Thug. It means that the lower
*  down folks have basically started cooperating with the prosecutor. Yes, the whole idea of Rico,
*  which originally started as a way to take down organized crime like the Mafia, was you roll up all
*  the little guys on the street. And to save themselves, they say who on the top of the food chain
*  was making these calls, right? They don't have young Thug saying on a wire tap, go kill this guy
*  for me. They don't have him saying, why a cell needs you to do this, why a cell needs you to do that.
*  They're saying that this is an unwritten contract that these are expectations that these guys share
*  almost psychically because of how they've come up and how they've pledged allegiance to this
*  criminal enterprise in YSL. Okay, so when the trial got underway last week in Atlanta,
*  let me know when you're ready, Ma'am. All right, if you wish to make an opening statement this
*  point in time, please go ahead. All right. Now, this is the law of the jungle. For the strength
*  of the pack is the wolf and the strength of the wolf is the pack.
*  You had Adrian love the prosecutor from Fanny Willis's office, starting with a quote from
*  Kipling's The Jungle Book. And what I expect the evidence to show in this case is that YSL,
*  YSL operated as a pack. Saying YSL operated as a pack and young Thug was the head of
*  that pack and they knew what they were supposed to do to obey him and his wishes. YSL or young
*  slime life was formed. And the defendant, Jeffrey Williams, was its proclaimed lead.
*  What she's doing here is trying to prove a that a criminal enterprise existed, in this case,
*  that YSL operated as a criminal street gang, that these guys in particular were members of that
*  group and that they committed crimes in furtherance of the group. And what evidence does the prosecutor
*  lay out here? So they want to show that YSL exists as a gang and that these guys are members.
*  So we're talking about everything from hoodies they're wearing, tattoos they have,
*  Instagram posts, even emojis. A great heart emoji and a great snake emoji,
*  I expect the evidence will show how the common identifiers associated with YSL.
*  They're the identifiers that they use to announce and project themselves to the rest of the world.
*  They say that the use of green hearts or the snake emoji, that that is how members of YSL
*  show their allegiance and signal to other people that they are part of this criminal street gang.
*  Okay, so that's the prosecutor's efforts to try to prove membership and the existence of this
*  operation, which actually says very important. What is the evidence that the prosecutor lays out
*  that actual crimes were committed by this operation? So there are a bunch of little crimes that might
*  seem disparate, an armed robbery, gun possession, drug possession, things like that. But there's one
*  murder that's really at the heart of this case. On January 10th at about seven o'clock in the
*  evening, out of Entomus, is living in the best life he was. In January of 2015, an alleged gang member
*  by the name of Donovan Thomas Jr., who's known as Nutt or Big Nutt, was killed in a drive by
*  shooting outside of a barber shop in Atlanta. You'll see evidence that Donovan Thomas was literally
*  in the middle, lacking it up with his friends, when a car drives by and opens the fire.
*  Funny Willis, as office says that YSL is responsible and that this set off a chain of events,
*  a gang war unlike Atlanta had ever seen, in which more than 50 shootings take place
*  as a retribution for this killing. And how does the prosecution link this 2015 murder to YSL
*  and to Young Thug? Two of the guys being tried alongside Young Thug are charged with executing
*  the actual shooting of Donovan Thomas, but they're also saying that Young Thug helped organize
*  an arrangement that he approved it, in part by renting the car that committed the drive by.
*  The evidence is going to show that the defendant, Jeffrey Williams, rented a car that other YSL
*  members used when they openly and notoriously burned out Donovan Thomas on January the 10th of 2015.
*  Donovan Thomas was killed in front of a Chevy Tahoe, an SUV, and prosecutors are also pointing
*  to specific Young Thug lyrics, where he says, for instance, 100 rounds in a Tahoe, meaning bullet holes
*  they said. And you'll see that Donovan Thomas's Tahoe had both these lyrics all along the back of
*  when they sprayed Donovan Thomas and his car on January the 10th of 2015.
*  And they're claiming that he was wrapping about this specific murder. So essentially the prosecution
*  is arguing that Young Thug kind of implicates himself for this murder in the song.
*  Yeah, in fact they say he's bragging about it.
*  Okay, so how do Young Thug, his attorneys respond to all of this evidence into this larger
*  argument in their defense? Young Thug's lawyer, Brian Steele, got up there for his own opening
*  statement and he said it's all made up. Young Thug is being targeted because he is a successful
*  rapper. And that to be a successful rapper these days, these are just the things that you wrap about.
*  They want you to fear, use it, and they're talks about killing, brothers, it is art.
*  You wrap about guns, you wrap about drugs, drive by shootings. This is tried and true material
*  for gangster rap. He went so far as to call Young Thug a studio gangster saying that he basically made
*  all this up and it's no different from Robert De Niro in Goodfellas. You will learn that this is part
*  of being involved in hip-hop. It is generating advertising, it's branding. He refers to himself
*  as Young Thug. Because most people think about it Thug as a criminal.
*  He says Thug itself is an acronym. It would be truly humble under God. That's what Thug is.
*  Not to mean that he does bad, but to mean that he is truly humble under God.
*  Sure, maybe he has a blood tattoo. That's what sells. Maybe he is flaunting YSL as a gang in his
*  music, but that's all a persona. If they can't link actual real life crimes to Young Thug and YSL,
*  then what is he even doing here in court? What the defense is really saying is that when it comes
*  to this question of authenticity at the heart of hip-hop and this trial, Young Thug isn't as authentic
*  as the prosecutors are saying. Yeah, and that he basically used the tropes of an existing genre
*  to make it out of horrible poverty. That he looked at what worked in rap music and he made that part
*  of his persona. And yes, he speaks about killing 12 and people being shocked and drugs and
*  drive by shootings. This is the environment that he grew up. This is the people he knew. He's the
*  stories he knew. They're basically arguing that Young Thug comes from a horrible neighborhood.
*  He makes it out. He's the most famous person to ever come from where he comes from.
*  And all of these guys want to impress him. So everybody doing petty crime on their own.
*  Sure, maybe they think they're doing it in service of this musical superstar.
*  You will learn that Jeffrey doesn't even know most of the people in this indictment.
*  They all know him because everybody in that area knows Jeffrey really. He is known as the Michael
*  Jordan of that area. But Young Thug's lawyer, Brian Steele says he doesn't even know some of these
*  people in the indictment. They're all just trying to get his attention. And how does the defense
*  respond to some of the specific evidence that the prosecutors put forward around that 2015
*  murder? You mentioned as being so central to this case, including the Chevy Tahoe lyrics.
*  Young Thug's lawyer, Brian Steele, speaking about the Chevy Tahoe, came right out and said
*  all of these lyrics are subject to interpretation. They're generic.
*  And they said 100 rounds in a Tahoe like, well, let's see, get a Tahoe.
*  Where are you somewhere driving a Tahoe with a hundred rounds?
*  Up to the listening, I guess.
*  He says 100 rounds in a Tahoe. Does that mean bullet holes in a Tahoe? Or does that mean somebody
*  carrying a gun within a Tahoe? The next line has Takah. He's a real Brian.
*  And Thug's lawyer saying, sure, maybe these crimes occurred. You cannot connect them to an artist
*  because he made work that seems to resemble it.
*  These are not confessions. These are not admissions. This is art.
*  So somebody watching this trial very closely, how strong, how weak does the prosecution's case
*  appear to be at this point? It's early, but I'm going to imagine you have started to think about
*  that question. I think this is a very, very complex case. And it is hard to explain to a
*  jury how all of these disparate crimes from across nearly a decade committed by many different people
*  are all connected to one organization and specifically one man in Young Thug.
*  So I think they're being very deliberate about laying out the information that they have and
*  trying to prove their case one witness at a time. They say they might call up to 400 people to
*  testify. This could take a very, very, very long time. I think there's still a lot of evidence
*  yet to be seen, including testimony from people who say they were active members of YSL.
*  And we're going to see how that plays out over the following months.
*  Let's just assume for a moment that the prosecution is successful here. And that Young Thug is
*  found in some way guilty of leading a criminal conspiracy. What is that going to mean for the wider
*  world that you cover, the world of hip-hop? I think it potentially has seismic effects on this
*  strain of popular rap music. So much of it is about believing these artists that they really come
*  from the life that they say they do and that they really do the things that they're rapping about.
*  There are many young fans around the country who are invested in that idea.
*  And yet if the prosecution can successfully say that all of this gang imagery, these videos,
*  these lyrics, these social media are the glue that holds together a criminal conspiracy.
*  Then I think there are a lot of rappers out there who are going to second guess the way they
*  present themselves and the way they talk about where they come from. And then when you think about
*  these communities themselves, the city of Atlanta and Cleveland Avenue, the neighborhood that Young Thug
*  comes from, you have the prosecution saying that YSL was terrorizing this neighborhood and that now
*  it should be a safer place. But if in fact, Young Thug is a product of his environment and this
*  is going to continue with or without him, this cycle. Like that's where we get a lot of this
*  rap music is because these neighborhoods are neglected, because there's no infrastructure, no
*  education. So I think that it leaves us in a tough place. Are we saving these communities by taking
*  these artists out of them? Or is he the pride of the community and in fact made something great
*  out of something horrible? Is the successful prosecution here not just a kind of legal framework
*  for going after other hip hop groups, but is it going to deprive the city of Atlanta potentially
*  of something or make it better? Yeah, like is the rap the cause or is rap the effect?
*  Well Joe, thank you very much. Thanks for having me.
*  Here's what else you need to nerdy. On Monday, the Times reported that the Israeli military has
*  begun an invasion of southern Gaza, a long awaited operation that could decide the fate of its war
*  with Hamas and put Palestinian civilians in even greater peril. Now that Israel has overtaken parts
*  of northern Gaza, southern Gaza is the last section of the territory under full Hamas control.
*  Israel is expected to focus its attacks on the city of Han Unis where Israel believes
*  Hamas' military and political leadership has sought shelter since fleeing the north.
*  And the White House has warned congressional leaders that the United States will run out of money
*  to send weapons to Ukraine by the end of the year unless lawmakers quickly approve emergency
*  military aid. The warning was President Biden's latest attempt to pressure Republicans,
*  especially in the House, to further fund Ukraine's military. Without the money, according to
*  the White House, Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia would be in jeopardy.
