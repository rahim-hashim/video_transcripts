*  From New York Times, I'm Micah Bavaro. This is Adali.
*  Today, we look at how a derailed train in East Palestine, Ohio, evolved from a local crisis
*  into a national story that has now commanded the attention of both parties in Congress.
*  My colleague Emily Cochran has been reporting from East Palestine.
*  It's Monday, March 6th.
*  Emily, I want to begin this conversation with a little bit of candor, which is that we
*  have struggled here on the show to figure out how to cover the story of this train derailment
*  in East Palestine, Ohio, because it's really been a story dominated by a lot of unanswered
*  questions. But that is now starting to change, and the story is moving into the halls of
*  Congress. And that makes you really the perfect person to talk to, because as it happens,
*  as listeners will remember, you're a former congressional reporter for the Times, who has
*  just become a national correspondent, now covering this story in Ohio.
*  So, let's begin with the basics of what exactly happened here.
*  So, this begins the night of February 3rd, as this nearly two-mile long train is making
*  its way through Ohio. And it's carrying a bunch of cargo, but most notably, some toxic
*  chemicals. And as the train is progressing, a wheel bearing starts to overheat. So, a sensor
*  records that rising temperature and sounds an alarm on the train. And as soon as the alarm
*  breaches the crew, the crew slows the train down, but that's not enough to stop it from
*  going off the tracks. And they see fire, they see smoke, they separate their locomotives,
*  the crew is okay, but now this train is derailed on the outskirts of a little village called
*  East Palastin in Ohio.
*  And what do we need to know about this village, East Palastin?
*  It's roughly 4,700 people. It's sort of in the rust belt of Ohio right between Youngston
*  and Pittsburgh. And it's a more rural, formerly industrial area, very red, Trump country.
*  They voted overwhelmingly for the former president in 2016 and 2020. But for a lot of people
*  there, it's a place where their families have always lived. And it was a place where they
*  could still afford to have their own farm own a few acres. And, you know, be close enough
*  to a bigger city if they needed to be, but not be of the big city.
*  Got it.
*  Describe this derailment in this village of East Palastin.
*  So the crew report seeing smoke and fire and the fire department responds, you know,
*  they try to take care of the fire and try to take care of this train that's now off the
*  tracks. But over the weekend, it becomes clear that there's a serious problem.
*  Some of the toxic chemicals in the cargo are at risk of exploding. And one of the chemicals
*  people are the most worried about is called vinyl chloride. It's a colorless gas using a lot of
*  plastics. And it can be really toxic. Got it. So railroad officials, government officials,
*  the governors of Ohio and Pennsylvania, which shows you how close this was to the border of the
*  two states. You know, they're on the phone over the weekend. And they since described it as
*  two bad options. Either you wait it out. There's an explosion that could send trappinol and all sorts
*  of things across the area or you do a controlled chemical burn. And the railroad's preference is to
*  do the chemical burn. And ultimately, the governors and local officials decide to go with it.
*  And for those of us who don't know what exactly is a controlled burn.
*  So essentially, the plan is to puncture the cars that we're carrying these chemicals,
*  drain out the chemicals and burn them off. So before doing that, they make a point of evacuating
*  folks within a mile radius. Sheriffs and other police officials are going door to door knocking,
*  saying you need to get out, you know, this is a life or death scenario because we're going to burn
*  off these chemicals. And officials go ahead with what they had promised. They begin this controlled
*  burn of the chemical cargo. But the consequence of that is that it sets off this giant,
*  terrifying looking black plume of smoke that not only covers the evacuation zone, but it blankets
*  the region. You know, there are farms in Pennsylvania that are now unable to see their neighbors across
*  the way because the smoke is so thick. And these stunning images of this giant plume over this
*  small town, this is the moment where a lot more people start paying attention. And a lot more people
*  suddenly have questions, not just about the derailment and the consequences of a train with toxic
*  cargo going off the tracks, but the consequences of this plume of chemicals across the area.
*  Right, this is the moment when I think a lot of us started to pay attention to this story because
*  we're watching this black plume of smoke on social media. But at the time, we're being told as our
*  people in this town that this is what the company thinks is the best and safest course and local
*  officials have signed off on it. Right. But I think what happens now as a result of that plume is that
*  this is no longer about a trained derailment. It's also about the lasting consequences of
*  burning off toxic chemicals on the outskirts of a small village and what that means for living in
*  this region long term. So government officials start testing the soil, testing the water, and testing
*  the air quality. And all the tests have so far shown that there's not significant amounts of
*  vinyl chloride, one of the most prominent of the toxic chemicals in this cargo, the one that folks
*  were really concerned about because that could potentially have long term health impacts.
*  The tests have so far not shown significant amounts. But for the people in that town, it's hard
*  to reconcile those results when there's a bunch of dead fish in the creeks that run through
*  their neighborhood. It's hard to reconcile those results when people are suddenly reporting migraines
*  and rashes and other ailments that just didn't occur before the chemical burn. And it's hard to
*  reconcile those results when the railroad company is doing the tests in conjunction with the EPA.
*  And there's a lot of mistrust of the railroad operator, their role in the derailment. And there's
*  a lot of mistrust that the tests are right. And you're on the ground talking to people about
*  this mistrust and this fear. So what exactly are they telling you? I talked to this one man,
*  Mike McKinney's a beekeeper and he's Palestinian. For me, my mom and dad live in the house right next
*  behind here. And this is my business and I live a few streets over. So not only does he have questions
*  about the health of his business, the ability to keep taking care of his bees and the safety of
*  eating their honey, he's also thinking about his kids. My mom makes icis for everybody in the summertime
*  and we set sprinklers out for all the kids in a neighborhood. We all congregate here.
*  And I feel like that's kind of taken away from us. Is it going to be safe for the kids
*  of the playing puddles this summer? And their ability to get dirt under their nails and play in the grass.
*  We like to go mushroom hunting, you know, go find marelles. We love being outside it. It's like
*  it's a little tainted, you know what I mean? It's a little bit, it's a little tainted.
*  Through COVID and being told you couldn't gather through the supply chain issues and the pains
*  of inflation, you could always go outside here. And the derailment and the plume just really
*  shattered the security in that for a lot of the people here. And that's where you really see
*  fears and mistrust just ignite across the region.
*  East Palestine residents say they feel confused and left in the dark.
*  There is no way we are safe being here. We just want to answer.
*  Locals say they're feeling the effects of the toxic chemicals.
*  To this moment right now I have just a really low grade constant headache.
*  I'm raising three granddaughters. They've had rashes. They've been sick.
*  Some have left their homes entirely. I don't trust anybody's right now. None of us know.
*  So amid all of this fear and mistrust comes the inevitable, the politics.
*  This could be an ecological disaster. We need to stay on top of it. That's exactly what our
*  office is doing. You have Senator JD Vance, newly elected Republican freshman from Ohio, who came
*  into the National Spotlight because he wrote a book that focused on white working class grievance,
*  making this same connection here. I've got to say the Secretary of Transportation
*  not talking about this issue, not talking about the frequency of trained derailments in our country,
*  talking about how we have too many white male construction workers instead of the fact that our
*  trains are crashing at alarming rates. The guy needs to do his job. He joins other Republicans in
*  calling out by the administration officials for not doing enough in the area and that's something
*  that then former president Trump taps into. To the people of East Palestine and to the nearby
*  communities in Ohio and Pennsylvania, we have told you loud and clear you are not forgotten.
*  He obviously looking to challenge President Biden in the 2024 election, comes to East Palestine
*  and makes a point of saying, I came to visit, where is President Biden? Now, Democrats are quick
*  to point the finger right back. Our personnel were on the ground within hours of this incident.
*  Pete Buttigieg, the Transportation Secretary, argued that there were administration officials
*  who were on the ground very quickly after this happened. You've got EPA there. You've got the CDC
*  Health and Human Services there to look after the health side. Not the political appointees,
*  but the staff who really have the on the ground knowledge here. And they also point to the fact that
*  under former president Trump, you saw a lot of safety and environmental regulations rolled back.
*  His administration was anti-regulation and pro-industry every step of the way.
*  And they argue that the former president's policies didn't do anything to stop this from happening.
*  And in fact, they say it could have made it worse.
*  So to these conservative leaders who are coming to town, this is now a story of democratic neglect
*  for working class, ohions. And in a sense, they're seeking to stoke these fears of that plume for
*  some political benefit. Democrats are showing up and saying, no, no, we have not forgotten about
*  this community. Actually, we've been here since the start of this accident. And we are assuring you
*  that everything is going to be fine. Yes, it's just another instance where you have this political
*  firestorm on top of a real tragedy and on top of a community that is hurting and has a lot of
*  questions and anxiety. So that's also why it's interesting to me that a few days later,
*  you do see some prominent members of both parties come together and start working on legislation
*  that could potentially address a lot of the problems at the heart of this derailment.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Emily, tell us about this legislation that's emerging from this accident and that surprisingly,
*  given the political firestorm you just described before the break, somehow involves elected officials
*  from both parties. So you have these disagreements about who has forgotten Ohioans,
*  who showed up to East Palestine first, who should have been there from the get go. But what both
*  parties can agree on is that there is a common villain here. And that's Norfolk Southern, the company
*  that was operating the train that derailed and one of the largest rail companies in the country.
*  And that is at the heart of this first bit of bipartisan legislation you see,
*  regulations and tighter safety rules against the railroads and the railroad company.
*  Well, how regulated is a company like Norfolk Southern and the entire freight rail industry
*  up to this point? So, free rail is generally considered relatively safe with about a thousand
*  derailments a year. You want the number of accidents to be zero. But injuries and deaths
*  aren't that common because of derailments. And incidents like this one involving hazardous material
*  are rare. But when you look at Norfolk Southern in particular, the rate of accidents has gone up
*  over the last four years. And it comes as the company is reporting record operating profits and
*  spending a lot of money and time lobbying against new rules that are intended to make trains even safer.
*  And you have railroad unions coming off some really contentious battles about their contracts
*  and their protections saying that their workforce has been slashed. There's not enough people or
*  safety precautions being taken to make rails even safer for both the communities these trains
*  are passing through, but also the people who are operating these trains. So, they're making a link
*  between their working conditions and an accident like the one that just happened in East
*  Palestine. Yes. And that's where lawmakers in both parties are seeing an opportunity to do something.
*  Well, which lawmakers exactly are we talking about and what exactly are they proposing be done?
*  So, you have the four senators, two states, or at the heart of this derailment. You have
*  the two Democrats from Pennsylvania, Bob Casey and John Fetterman. But then you have the bipartisan
*  delegation from Ohio. You have JD Vance, who's a Republican and Sherrod Brown, who's a Democrat
*  facing re-election this midterm cycle. And they sign on to this bill along with Marco Rubio,
*  a Republican from Florida and Josh Holly, a Republican from Missouri. So, a decent amount of
*  bipartisan collaboration by today's standards. And then another important element here is when
*  Chuck Schumer, the majority leader who controls the Senate floor, comes out and says, I think this is
*  a worthwhile piece of legislation. And I will work to help get it through the Senate. I will work
*  to help get those 60 votes you need to advance any piece of legislation. That's a hurdle. A lot of
*  legislation just can't meet right now. But if it does clear that hurdle, President Biden has said
*  he will sign it. Right. So, walk us through the key provisions of this bipartisan legislation that's
*  being proposed and how these elements would have applied to this case or could prevent future cases
*  like it. So, one of the biggest concerns we heard about in the aftermath of this was that the
*  local communities didn't know that the strain was carrying these toxic chemicals. The current
*  regulations say if a strain is carrying flammable liquids in either 20 consecutive cars or 35
*  cars total, they have to notify the states they're traveling through. And they also have to
*  meet a whole other round of tougher safety rules. But the Ohio train didn't meet that standard.
*  So, it didn't need to take those additional precautions. Interesting. So, the legislation
*  would effectively ensure that any train carrying this kind of cargo would have to let the communities
*  know that it was coming through. Because that was crucial context that first responders and government
*  officials would have needed in the immediate aftermath of the derailment. The heat of the train
*  car investigators have said was so high that it melted the plastic placards off of the train car
*  that would have told first responders what was inside. So, had they had that notice that would have
*  just been an extra layer of precaution and knowledge that can be pretty critical in the aftermath
*  of a derailment like this. That's really interesting. Okay, what else?
*  So, you remember that at the heart of this derailment was a hot wheel bearing and overheating
*  wheel bearing that the crew was notified about very, very late in the game. Right. So, what the
*  legislation would do is it would require stricter scrutiny of parts like a wheel bearing and other
*  elements. The train car to ensure that malfunctions are caught earlier and safety precautions are
*  stronger to avoid something like that happening again. So, basically heightened inspections and
*  safety protocols. Exactly. So, as a result of that, the measure would really toughen the inspection
*  requirements for rail cars, the parts and railway detectors just to make sure that not only are
*  their precautions taken before the trains get on the railroad, but it's possible to catch them
*  early on in the process of something malfunctioning. And then to really back up the increased
*  emphasis on safety here, it would also set aside money for federal agencies to just do more research
*  and development about how to make tank cars stronger and safer going forward.
*  Emily, it seems notable and perhaps even noble for lawmakers to come together after an accident
*  like this and create legislation. But is it possible that this legislation, because it's been crafted
*  so specifically to speak to what happened in East Palestine, is really only addressing what happened
*  there. I mean, should these provisions potentially be wider in scope, or is this in fact a
*  relatively safe industry that doesn't really require broad new regulation? In other words,
*  is what happened here, especially given the chemicals involved, an exception?
*  We are in an era of divided government now. Any bill that becomes law needs to not only get enough
*  Republican support in the Senate, but now needs to win the support of a Republican controlled house.
*  And I think one, it's not clear if this legislation can do that, and two, it guarantees that any
*  measure will not go as far as Democrats and their allies, particularly in the unions, want it to go.
*  And I think there is a fear that this is not going to be an exception, particularly at a moment
*  when the Biden administration wants rail to become even more prominent in American life.
*  They're putting a lot more money towards it. They want it to be a safer, bigger, more utilized
*  aspect of transportation in this country. And I think there's a lot of fear that as trains continue
*  to become a bigger part of the transportation industry, you will see more governments. You will
*  see more accidents if those safety precautions aren't strengthened at the same time.
*  Right. What about Norfolk Southern? Is it opposing this legislation?
*  So it hasn't explicitly weighed in on this legislation yet, but the reality is the company's
*  facing a ton of political pressure from both sides. The chief executive is set to testify before
*  the Senate. And I think that'll be a pretty heated confrontation between lawmakers and the company.
*  And it's facing a lot of pressure across the board to make sure that it not only takes responsibility
*  for cleaning up this accident, but making sure it doesn't happen again.
*  Right. It seems safe to say that this company is not exactly at the peak of its political power
*  to oppose legislation like this given what just happened. So Emily, back to the town of East
*  Palestine itself, now that there's all this activity in Washington. And now that so many officials
*  from both parties have visited the community and committed themselves to trying to do something
*  to make this right, how are the people there that you have spent all this time talking to
*  feeling in this moment? Are they heartened or not really at all?
*  I think they appreciate the attention. There's a lot of concern that at some point, the national
*  attention is going to move away from their community. And they're going to be left with these long
*  term consequences and questions. I think the reality is the fears have made a lot of people
*  for the first time question if they want to keep living in East Palestine and the surrounding area.
*  If it's safe to keep their kids there, if it's safe to make this the home where they spend the
*  rest of their lives. And then even for the people who are determined to see this through, if you will,
*  who are determined to keep their lives here, there's also a fear about a lasting stigma.
*  A short term, it's going to affect everything here. No one wants to come here.
*  I talked to this couple, the elders, who own a greenhouse on the outskirts of East Palestine.
*  And they're wrestling with that now. I'm not so concerned about the land as I'm a stigma,
*  about the land. Are people going to be comfortable that our water is okay?
*  That no matter what they do, no matter if the water, the soil, the air keeps coming back as safe,
*  the people are always going to remember them and their businesses and their products as the place
*  where this toxic plume happened. From a business standpoint, no one's coming here to shop. You
*  can go 20 miles north of here and buy what we have here, or you can come here and risk your life
*  and buy what we have. Which you're not risking your life. No, that's not true. That's what I'm saying.
*  I mean, why are people going to buy from their greenhouse when you can get plants from a
*  separate greenhouse that's dozens and dozens of miles away from the derailment site?
*  And the answer is for a lot of people, they wouldn't. That's a really hard reality.
*  And it's hard to see how any legislation could change that.
*  Well, Emily, thank you very much. We really appreciate it. Thank you for having me.
*  Over the weekend, another freight train operated by Norfolk Southern derailed in a different
*  part of Ohio. This time, it was a city of Springfield, about 70 miles away from East Palestine.
*  Norfolk Southern said that no hazardous materials were on board, but local authorities ordered
*  those who live nearby to shelter in place out of quote an abundance of caution.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. Over the weekend, dozens of nations agreed on language
*  for an historic treaty that would protect the biodiversity of the world's oceans.
*  Until now, no international body or agreement has been primarily focused on marine biodiversity,
*  which is under growing threat from climate change, overfishing, and underwater mining.
*  And doctors have removed a cancerous skin lesion from President Biden's chest,
*  according to a letter released on Friday from Biden's physician.
*  The letter described the lesion as a basal cell carcinoma, said that all cancerous tissue was
*  successfully removed, and that no further treatment is required.
