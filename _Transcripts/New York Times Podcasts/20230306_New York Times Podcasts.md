# How a Derailed Train Galvanized an Ohio Town, and Congress
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip3K71cnNDI)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is a daily.
*  Today, we look at how a derailed train in East Palestine, Ohio evolved from a local
*  crisis into a national story that has now commanded the attention of both parties in
*  Congress.
*  My colleague, Emily Cochran, has been reporting from East Palestine.
*  It's Monday, March 6th.
*  Emily, I want to begin this conversation with a little bit of candor, which is that we have
*  struggled here on the show to figure out how to cover the story of this train derailment
*  in East Palestine, Ohio, because it's really been a story dominated by a lot of unanswered
*  questions.
*  But that is now starting to change, and the story is moving into the halls of Congress.
*  And that makes you really the perfect person to talk to, because as it happens, as listeners
*  will remember, you're a former congressional reporter for the Times who has just become
*  a national correspondent now covering this story in Ohio.
*  So let's begin with the basics of what exactly happened here.
*  So this begins the night of February 3rd, as this nearly two mile long train is making
*  its way through Ohio, and it's carrying a bunch of cargo, but most notably some toxic
*  chemicals.
*  And as the train is progressing, a wheel bearing starts to overheat.
*  So a sensor records that rising temperature and sounds an alarm on the train.
*  And as soon as the alarm breaches the crew, the crew slows the train down, but that's
*  not enough to stop it from going off the tracks.
*  And they see fire, they see smoke, they separate their locomotives, the crew is okay.
*  But now this train is derailed on the outskirts of a little village called East Palestine
*  in Ohio.
*  And what do we need to know about this village, East Palestine?
*  It's roughly 4,700 people.
*  It's sort of in the rust belt of Ohio, right between Youngston and Pittsburgh.
*  And it's a more rural, formerly industrial area, very red Trump country.
*  They voted overwhelmingly for the former president in 2016 and 2020.
*  But for a lot of people there, it's a place where their families have always lived.
*  And it was a place where they could still afford to have their own farm, own a few acres,
*  and be close enough to a bigger city if they needed to be, but not be of the big city.
*  Got it.
*  So describe this derailment in this village of East Palestine.
*  So the crew report seeing smoke and fire, and the fire department responds.
*  They try to take care of the fire and try to take care of this train that's now off
*  the tracks.
*  But over the weekend, it becomes clear that there's a serious problem.
*  Some of the toxic chemicals in the cargo are at risk of exploding.
*  And one of the chemicals people are the most worried about is called vinyl chloride.
*  It's a colorless gas used in a lot of plastics, and it can be really toxic.
*  Got it.
*  So railroad officials, government officials, the governors of Ohio and Pennsylvania, which
*  shows you how close this was to the border of the two states, they're on the phone over
*  the weekend.
*  And they've since described it as two bad options.
*  Either you wait it out, there's an explosion that could send shrapnel and all sorts of
*  the area, or you do a controlled chemical burn.
*  And the railroad's preference is to do the chemical burn.
*  And ultimately, the governors and local officials decide to go with it.
*  And for those of us who don't know what exactly is a controlled burn.
*  So essentially, the plan is to puncture the cars that we're carrying these chemicals,
*  drain out the chemicals and burn them off.
*  So before doing that, they make a point of evacuating folks within a mile radius.
*  Sheriffs and other police officials are going door to door knocking saying you need to get
*  out.
*  This is a life or death scenario because we're going to burn off these chemicals.
*  And officials go ahead with what they had promised.
*  They begin this controlled burn of the chemical cargo.
*  But the consequence of that is that it sets off this giant, terrifying looking black plume
*  of smoke that not only covers the evacuation zone, but it blankets the region.
*  There are farms in Pennsylvania that are now unable to see their neighbors across the way
*  because the smoke is so thick.
*  And these stunning images of this giant plume over this small town, this is the moment where
*  a lot more people start paying attention.
*  And a lot more people suddenly have questions, not just about the derailment and the consequences
*  of a train with toxic cargo going off the tracks, but the consequences of this plume
*  of chemicals across the area.
*  Right, this is the moment when I think a lot of us started to pay attention to this story
*  because we're watching this black plume of smoke on social media.
*  But at the time, we're being told, as our people in this town, that this is what the
*  company thinks is the best and safest course and local officials have signed off on it.
*  Right.
*  But I think what happens now as a result of that plume is that this is no longer about
*  a train derailment.
*  It's also about the lasting consequences of burning off toxic chemicals on the outskirts
*  of a small village and what that means for living in this region long term.
*  So government officials start testing the soil, testing the water, and testing the air
*  quality.
*  And all the tests have so far shown that there's not significant amounts of vinyl chloride,
*  one of the most prominent of the toxic chemicals in this cargo, the one that folks were really
*  concerned about because that could potentially have long term health impacts.
*  The tests have so far not shown significant amounts.
*  But for the people in that town, it's hard to reconcile those results when there's a
*  bunch of dead fish in the creeks that run through their neighborhood.
*  It's hard to reconcile those results when people are suddenly reporting migraines and
*  rashes and other ailments that just didn't occur before the chemical burn.
*  And it's hard to reconcile those results when the railroad company is doing the tests in
*  conjunction with the EPA.
*  And there's a lot of mistrust of the railroad operator, their role in the derailment.
*  And there's a lot of mistrust that the tests are right.
*  And you're on the ground talking to people about this mistrust and this fear.
*  So what exactly are they telling you?
*  I talked to this one man, Mike McKim.
*  He's a beekeeper and he's Palestine.
*  This for me, like my mom and dad live in the house right next behind here.
*  And this is my business and I live a few streets over.
*  So not only does he have questions about the health of his business, the ability to keep
*  taking care of his bees and the safety of eating their honey, he's also thinking about
*  his kids.
*  My mom makes icee's for everybody in the summertime and we set sprinklers out for all the kids
*  in the neighborhood.
*  We all congregate here.
*  And I feel like that's kind of taken away from us.
*  Is it going to be safe for the kids to play in puddles this summer?
*  And their ability to get dirt under their nails and play in the grass.
*  We like to go mushroom hunting, you know, go find morels.
*  We love being outside and it's like, it's a little tainted.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's a little bit, it's a little tainted.
*  Through COVID and being told you couldn't gather through the supply chain issues and
*  the pains of inflation, you could always go outside here.
*  And the derailment and the plume just really shattered the security in that for a lot of
*  the people here.
*  And that's where you really see fears and mistrust just ignite across the region.
*  East Palestine residents say they feel confused and left in the dark.
*  There is no way we are safe being here.
*  We just want answers.
*  Locals say they're feeling the effects of the toxic chemicals.
*  To this moment, right now, I have just a really low-grade constant headache.
*  I'm raising three granddaughters.
*  They've had rashes.
*  They've been sick.
*  Some have left their homes entirely.
*  I don't trust anybody's right now.
*  None of us know.
*  So amid all of this fear and mistrust comes the inevitable.
*  The politics.
*  This could be an ecological disaster.
*  We need to stay on top of it.
*  That's exactly what our office is doing.
*  You have Senator J.D. Vance, newly elected Republican freshman from Ohio, who came into
*  the national spotlight because he wrote a book that focused on white working-class grievance,
*  making this same connection here.
*  I've got to say, the Secretary of Transportation not talking about this issue, not talking
*  about the frequency of train derailments in our country, talking about how we have too
*  many white male construction workers instead of the fact that our trains are crashing at
*  alarming rates.
*  That guy needs to do his job.
*  He joins other Republicans in calling out Biden administration officials for not doing
*  enough in the area.
*  And that's something that then former President Trump taps into.
*  To the people of East Palestine and to the nearby communities in Ohio and Pennsylvania,
*  we have told you loud and clear, you are not forgotten.
*  He obviously looking to challenge President Biden in the 2024 election comes to East
*  Palestine and makes a point of saying, I came to visit.
*  Where is President Biden?
*  Now, Democrats are quick to point the finger right back.
*  Well, our personnel were on the ground within hours of this incident.
*  Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, argued that there were administration officials
*  who were on the ground very quickly after this happened.
*  You've got EPA there.
*  You've got the CDC, Health and Human Services there to look after the health side.
*  Not the political appointees, but the staff who really have the on the ground knowledge
*  here. And, you know, they also point to the fact that under former President Trump, you
*  saw a lot of safety and environmental regulations rolled back.
*  His administration was anti-regulation and pro-industry every step of the way.
*  And they argue that the former president's policies didn't do anything to stop this from
*  happening. And in fact, they say it could have made it worse.
*  So to these conservative leaders who are coming to town, this is now a story of
*  Democratic neglect for working class Ohioans.
*  And in a sense, they're seeking to stoke these fears of that plume for some political
*  benefit. Democrats are showing up and saying, no, no, we have not forgotten about
*  this community. Actually, we've been here since the start of this accident.
*  And we are assuring you that everything is going to be fine.
*  Yes. It's just another instance where you have this political firestorm on top of a
*  real tragedy and on top of a community that is hurting and has a lot of questions and
*  anxiety. So that's also why it's interesting to me that
*  a few days later, you do see some prominent members of both parties come together and
*  start working on legislation that could potentially address a lot of the problems at
*  the heart of this derailment.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Emily, tell us about this legislation that's emerging from this accident and that
*  surprisingly, given the political firestorm you just described before the break, somehow
*  involves elected officials from both parties.
*  So you have these disagreements about who has forgotten Ohio and who showed up to East
*  Palestine first, who should have been there from the get go.
*  But what both parties can agree on is that there is a common villain here, and that's
*  Norfolk Southern, the company that was operating the train that derailed and one of the
*  largest rail companies in the country.
*  And that is at the heart of this first bit of bipartisan legislation.
*  You see regulations and tighter safety rules against the railroads and the railroad
*  company. Well, how regulated is a company like Norfolk Southern and the entire freight
*  rail industry up to this point?
*  So freight rail is generally considered relatively safe with about a thousand derailments
*  a year. You want the number of accidents to be zero.
*  But injuries and deaths aren't that common because of derailments.
*  And incidents like this one involving hazardous material are rare.
*  But when you look at Norfolk Southern in particular, the rate of accidents has gone up
*  over the last four years.
*  And it comes as the company is reporting record operating profits and spending a lot of
*  money and time lobbying against new rules that are intended to make trains even safer.
*  And you have railroad unions coming off some really contentious battles about their
*  contracts and their protections, saying that their workforce has been slashed.
*  There's not enough people or safety precautions being taken to make rails even safer
*  for both the communities these trains are passing through, but also the people who are
*  operating these trains.
*  So they're making a link between their working conditions and an accident like the one
*  that just happened in East Palestine.
*  Yes. And that's where lawmakers in both parties are seeing an opportunity to do
*  something. Well, which lawmakers exactly are we talking about and what exactly are
*  they proposing be done?
*  So you have the four senators whose states are at the heart of this derailment.
*  You have the two Democrats from Pennsylvania, Bob Casey and John Fetterman.
*  But then you have the bipartisan delegation from Ohio.
*  You have J.D. Vance, who is a Republican, and Sherrod Brown, who's a Democrat facing
*  reelection this midterm cycle.
*  And they sign on to this bill along with Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, and
*  Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri.
*  So a decent amount of bipartisan collaboration by today's standards.
*  And then another important element here is when Chuck Schumer, the majority leader who
*  controls the Senate floor, comes out and says, I think this is a worthwhile piece of
*  legislation and I will work to help get it through the Senate.
*  I will work to help get those 60 votes you need to advance any piece of legislation.
*  That's a hurdle a lot of legislation just can't meet right now.
*  But if it does clear that hurdle, President Biden has said he will sign it.
*  Right. So walk us through the key provisions of this bipartisan legislation that's
*  being proposed and how these elements would have applied to this case or could prevent
*  future cases like it.
*  So one of the biggest concerns we heard about in the aftermath of this was that the local
*  communities didn't know that the train was carrying these toxic chemicals.
*  The current regulations say if a train is carrying flammable liquids in either 20
*  consecutive cars or 35 cars total, they have to notify the states they're traveling
*  through. And they also have to meet a whole other round of tougher safety rules.
*  But the Ohio train didn't meet that standard.
*  So it didn't need to take those additional precautions.
*  Interesting. So the legislation would effectively ensure that any train carrying
*  this kind of cargo would have to let the communities know that it was coming through
*  because that was crucial context that first responders and government officials
*  would have needed in the immediate aftermath of the derailment.
*  The heat of the train car, investigators have said, was so high that it melted the
*  plastic placards off of the train car that would have told first responders what was
*  inside. So had they had that notice, that would have just been an extra layer of
*  precaution and knowledge that can be pretty critical in the aftermath of a derailment
*  like this.
*  That's really interesting. OK, what else?
*  So you remember that at the heart of this derailment was a hot wheel bearing, an
*  overheating wheel bearing that the crew was notified about very, very late in the
*  game. Right.
*  So what the legislation would do is it would require stricter scrutiny of parts like a
*  wheel bearing and other elements of the train car to ensure that malfunctions are
*  caught earlier and safety precautions are stronger to avoid something like that
*  happening again.
*  So basically heightened inspections and safety protocols.
*  Exactly. So as a result of that, the measure would really toughen the inspection
*  requirements for rail cars, the parts and railway detectors just to make sure that
*  not only are there precautions taken before the trains get on the railroad, but it's
*  possible to catch them early on in the process of something malfunctioning.
*  And then to really back up the increased emphasis on safety here, it would also set
*  aside money for federal agencies to just do more research and development about how to
*  make tank cars stronger and safer going forward.
*  Emily, it seems notable and perhaps even noble for lawmakers to come together after an
*  accident like this and create legislation.
*  But is it possible that this legislation, because it's been crafted so specifically to
*  speak to what happened in East Palestine, is really only addressing what happened there?
*  I mean, should these provisions potentially be wider in scope or is this in fact a
*  relatively safe industry that doesn't really require broad new regulation?
*  In other words, is what happened here, especially given the chemicals involved, an
*  exception? We are in an era of divided government now.
*  Any bill that becomes law needs to not only get enough Republican support in the Senate,
*  but now needs to win the support of a Republican controlled House.
*  And I think, one, it's not clear if this legislation can do that.
*  And two, it guarantees that any measure will not go as far as Democrats and their allies,
*  particularly in the unions, want it to go.
*  And I think there is a fear that this is not going to be an exception, particularly at a
*  moment when the Biden administration wants rail to become even more prominent in American
*  life. They're putting a lot more money towards it.
*  They want it to be a safer, bigger, more utilized aspect of transportation in this country.
*  And I think there's a lot of fear that as trains continue to become a bigger part of the
*  transportation industry, you will see more derailments.
*  You will see more accidents if those safety precautions aren't strengthened at the same
*  time. Right.
*  What about Norfolk Southern? Is it opposing this legislation?
*  So it hasn't explicitly weighed in on this legislation yet.
*  But the reality is the company is facing a ton of political pressure from both sides.
*  The chief executive is set to testify before the Senate.
*  And I think that'll be a pretty heated confrontation between lawmakers and the company.
*  And it's facing a lot of pressure across the board to make sure that it not only takes
*  responsibility for cleaning up this accident, but making sure it doesn't happen again.
*  Right. It seems safe to say that this company is not exactly at the peak of its political
*  power to oppose legislation like this, given what just happened.
*  So, Emily, back to the town of East Palestine itself.
*  Now that there's all this activity in Washington and now that so many officials from both
*  parties have visited the community and committed themselves to trying to do something to
*  make this right. How are the people there that you have spent all this time talking to
*  feeling in this moment?
*  Are they heartened or not really at all?
*  I think they appreciate the attention.
*  There's a lot of concern that at some point the national attention is going to move away
*  from their community and they're going to be left with these long term consequences and
*  questions. I think the reality is the fears have made a lot of people for the first time
*  question if they want to keep living in East Palestine and the surrounding area, if it's safe
*  to keep their kids there, if it's safe to make this the home where they spend the rest of
*  their lives. And then even for the people who are determined to see this through, if you
*  will, who are determined to keep their lives here, there's also a fear about a lasting
*  stigma.
*  Short term, it's going to affect everything here.
*  No one wants to come here.
*  I talked to this couple, the Elzers, who own a greenhouse on the outskirts of East
*  Palestine, and they're wrestling with that now.
*  I'm not so concerned about the land as I am the stigma about the land.
*  You know, are people going to be comfortable that our water is OK?
*  You know, that no matter what they do, no matter if the water, the soil, the air keeps
*  coming back as safe, that people are always going to remember them and their businesses
*  and their products as the place where this toxic plume happened.
*  You know, from a business standpoint, you know, no one's come here to shop.
*  You can go 20 miles north of here and buy what we have here, or you can come here and
*  risk your life and buy what we have.
*  Which you're not risking your life.
*  No, that's a perception.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  You know, why are people going to buy from their greenhouse when you can get plants from
*  a separate greenhouse that's dozens and dozens of miles away from the derailment site?
*  And the answer is for a lot of people, they wouldn't.
*  That's a really hard reality.
*  And it's hard to see how any legislation could change that.
*  Well, Emily, thank you very much.
*  We really appreciate it.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  Over the weekend, another freight train operated by Norfolk Southern derailed in a
*  different part of Ohio, this time near the city of Springfield, about 70 miles away
*  from East Palestine.
*  Norfolk Southern said that no hazardous materials were on board, but local authorities
*  ordered those who live nearby to shelter in place out of, quote, an abundance of
*  caution. We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Over the weekend, dozens of nations agreed on language for an historic treaty that
*  would protect the biodiversity of the world's oceans.
*  Until now, no international body or agreement has been primarily focused on marine
*  biodiversity, which is under growing threat from climate change, overfishing and
*  underwater mining.
*  And doctors have removed a cancerous skin lesion from President Biden's chest,
*  according to a letter released on Friday from Biden's physician.
*  The letter described the lesion as a basal cell carcinoma, said that all cancerous
*  tissue was successfully removed and that no further treatment is required.
