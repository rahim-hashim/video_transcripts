# 'The Interview': Gretchen Whitmer Wants a Gen X President — in 2028
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA)
*  from the New York Times. This
*  is the interview. I'm Lulu
*  Garcia Navarro. There is one
*  thing that's certain about this
*  year's election. Whatever the
*  result, it will be the end of an
*  era opening the door to a new
*  generation of political leaders.
*  And for Democrats, there are few
*  politicians buzzier than
*  Michigan Governor Gretchen
*  Whitmer. After serving in the
*  Michigan State Legislature,
*  Whitmer was elected to the
*  governorship in 2018. And when
*  COVID hit, she became a national
*  lightning rod for some of the
*  restrictions she put in place,
*  taking hits from Trump, whose
*  rhetoric she blames for
*  inspiring an assassination
*  attempt against her. But it was
*  what Whitmer achieved in 2022
*  that really cemented her as a
*  political force. That year, she
*  was reelected on the back of a
*  reproductive rights ballot
*  referendum. She also achieved
*  something that hadn't happened
*  in nearly 40 years in Michigan.
*  With the help of redistricting,
*  she gave Democrats a trifecta
*  with both the state house and
*  the Senate flipping to blue. In
*  the past few years, Whitmer has
*  leveraged that majority to
*  enact a progressive wish list of
*  policies, including basic but
*  meaningful gun control
*  legislation, a new clean energy
*  plan. And she's also been
*  pushing for educational reforms
*  like universal pre-K and free
*  community college. Whitmer is
*  term limited, though. Her
*  governorship will end in 2026.
*  And there's a lot of speculation
*  about what's next for her. Like
*  many politicians with national
*  ambitions, she's written a new
*  book about her life and vision
*  for the country. It's called
*  True Grudge. She's also raising
*  her profile as co-chair of
*  President Biden's reelection
*  campaign. We talk about Biden's
*  challenges in the second half of
*  our conversation and about
*  whether she can deliver the
*  must-win state of Michigan.
*  Here's my conversation with
*  Governor Gretchen Whitmer.
*  I want to get the elephant out
*  of the room, which is you're
*  releasing this memoir in the
*  middle of the 2024 election
*  cycle. So why now? So it's less
*  of a memoir and more of like a
*  handbook. The question I get
*  wherever I'm traveling, even
*  within Michigan, but certainly
*  outside of Michigan as well, is
*  how do I stay positive in all
*  the ugliness and craziness that
*  I've had to lead the state of
*  Michigan through? How do I stay
*  positive? Why do I want to keep
*  doing this work? And I thought,
*  you know, this is going to be
*  another heavy year, 2024.
*  Sure is.
*  It's going to feel very dark at
*  times with the political
*  rhetoric and this important
*  election coming up. And I
*  thought, if I can put some light
*  out into the world right now,
*  maybe you can laugh at my
*  expense, or maybe there's a
*  little inspiration here that'll
*  help you get through whatever
*  you were navigating.
*  Were you worried about how it
*  was going to be perceived,
*  though, putting it there at this
*  moment? Because you can put
*  light into the dark at any time.
*  But this is, as you mentioned,
*  just a very important election
*  and you are a very prominent
*  Democrat.
*  You know, I can't worry about
*  how everything's going to be
*  perceived. That's one lesson I
*  certainly have learned in the
*  last six years, no matter what I
*  do or say, people are going to
*  have their own take on it. So
*  you got to do what you know the
*  right thing to do is.
*  This book did help me
*  understand you as a person.
*  It is a book that talks a lot
*  about your own personal story,
*  how you view the world. You
*  write in the book about how you
*  partied in high school and
*  college and that you didn't
*  really become ambitious until
*  you got into law school. You
*  talk about how you actually
*  threw up on your principal who
*  found you passed out in the
*  parking lot from drinking. And
*  first of all, like mortifying,
*  but you didn't include this in
*  your book for no reason. So I'm
*  curious, what were you hoping
*  to show?
*  Well, every one of us has our
*  flaws, right? That was a period
*  of time when, you know, I was
*  not particularly disciplined
*  and was focused more on having
*  fun and that's, that's okay, too.
*  I learned a lot during that
*  period of time, but it was that
*  real big screw up that taught
*  me each phase in life. You
*  learned things that you didn't
*  You learn things, you've got
*  opportunities and my mom and I,
*  we had a very tough relationship
*  during that period of time, as I
*  would have had with my daughters
*  if they'd been as wild as I was
*  at that age. But I also was the
*  moment where I really learned
*  who I was. And when I went to
*  law school is when it all
*  started to click for me. So I
*  was a little bit more of a late
*  bloomer than my sister was. But
*  by the same token, I think these
*  are lessons that help keep me
*  humble. And fortunately, when I
*  was a teenager, we didn't all
*  have phones where we could film
*  one another making, you know,
*  not the greatest judgments.
*  Yeah, for sure. And in fact, you
*  make a point that humor and
*  being able to not take yourself
*  so seriously is part of what you
*  think makes you a powerful
*  politician in a way. You
*  actually put a picture of
*  yourself in the book, missing a
*  front tooth because you had an
*  accident growing up. So first of
*  all, it's funny that you married
*  a dentist, right? As a woman,
*  though, we're always so attuned
*  to the way we look, how we're
*  perceived. I mean, women we know
*  and specifically in politics get
*  judged a lot more harshly. Do you
*  worry about that?
*  I do, you know, especially at the
*  beginning of my career as a young
*  woman in going into politics,
*  women, of course, you know, we
*  can't just switch out ties every
*  day. We've got to be mindful of
*  what we wear on top of how we
*  look, etc. And so I, it can get
*  expensive. Most of the things
*  that I wear and buy are actually
*  secondhand. And I rented a dress
*  from Rent the Runway to give my
*  first State of the State speech
*  in and the predominantly
*  Republican legislature to whom I
*  was addressing at the time, I
*  knew that there were a lot of
*  things that they weren't going to
*  share as terms of values and
*  vision for the state. And when I
*  laid out the vision, but I wanted
*  to feel confident going in, I
*  wore this, I thought attractive
*  blue dress. Oh my God, the
*  fashion police showed up the next
*  day. It was, the critique was not
*  about what I said or the important
*  message that I shared. It was
*  about what I was wearing. And they
*  actually interviewed people about
*  how they thought I looked in that
*  dress. And, you know, as the
*  mother of two young women, it was
*  just crushing, not because it
*  hurt my feelings, but because here
*  I am laying out a vision for a
*  state after just getting elected
*  the chief executive officer of a
*  state of 10 million people who have
*  serious issues to tackle. And
*  that's what I was talking about.
*  And the focus was what I was on
*  what I was wearing. And I think
*  that we deal with a lot more of
*  that than men ever do. And I am
*  mindful of it because I want
*  people to focus on what I'm saying,
*  not anything else.
*  When you say you're mindful of
*  it, do you forefront your gender
*  or do you pretend that it's not
*  there? I'm not going to talk
*  about it. I'm a person in a suit
*  and my gender doesn't matter. Or
*  do you feel that there is a
*  different thing that as a female
*  politician you bring to the table?
*  I go back and forth to be honest,
*  Lulu. I think that there are
*  moments where you might take a
*  situation as a learning
*  opportunity to educate someone.
*  There are moments where when
*  you're talking about something
*  that is inherently gender based,
*  reproductive rights, for instance,
*  talk about my experience as a
*  woman, as a sexual assault
*  survivor. There are moments
*  where I ignore the noise and
*  just muster through. It's, I
*  think, a calculation. A
*  calculation maybe sounds too,
*  you know, planning. It's an
*  assessment that women have to
*  make at all times. A colleague
*  when I was in the Senate came
*  up to me and said something
*  totally out of bounds and very
*  over the line. And I remember
*  sitting there thinking, I've
*  got to figure out how to
*  respond to this. Can I educate
*  him? Why what he just said is
*  totally inappropriate? Do I
*  ignore it? Do I laugh and brush
*  it off and tell him, you know,
*  that he's foolish? Do I take it
*  on in a very serious way? And
*  it's sometimes exhausting to
*  figure out how do I have to
*  respond to someone else's bad
*  behavior? But I am mindful
*  because I think about the women
*  who come after me or my own
*  daughters. And what did you
*  decide? Well, in that one, I
*  responded with some very
*  colorful language and put him
*  in his place and he never
*  bothered me again.
*  I want to talk a little bit
*  about you as a political leader
*  because one of the reasons you
*  are viewed as this rising star
*  for Democrats is that you are a
*  popular governor in a battle
*  ground state. In 2022, you got a
*  trifecta for the Democrats. You
*  won the House, you won the
*  Senate and you won the
*  governorship. I guess my
*  question is, there's two ways
*  that you can move when
*  something like that happens,
*  especially in a state that is so
*  closely divided. You can decide
*  to do what some governors in red
*  states and purple states have
*  done, which is to say, I'm going
*  to be a centrist, I'm going to
*  move more incrementally, or you
*  can enact what is a very
*  partisan agenda, right? You took
*  that second route. What was the
*  calculation there? Why did you
*  decide I'm going to really try
*  and run with the ball?
*  Well, we ran on an agenda and
*  people elected us on that
*  agenda. My philosophy is if
*  people have elected you to do
*  something, do it. Don't waste
*  time. Don't make excuses.
*  Deliver. I'm grateful that I've
*  got this second term. A lot of
*  folks are writing my political
*  obituary going into the
*  re-elect in 2022. I ended up
*  winning by almost 11 points. That
*  for me, made me feel very
*  confident that people expected me
*  to lead on the issues on which I
*  was running. I also, though, want
*  to make sure to recognize, I
*  think you can't win an election
*  in Michigan by double digits if
*  you're not also drawing over
*  people who are not traditional
*  Democrats. I'm proud of that.
*  One of the stories in the book I
*  tell is about my friend Randy
*  Richardville, the Republican
*  leader. We had a lot of knockdown
*  dragouts when I was the
*  Democratic leader in the Senate.
*  He was the Republican leader. He
*  was in the majority. We did
*  battle. We'd often, though, also
*  end the day going and grabbing a
*  beer together because I think
*  that it's important to not take
*  things personally but to stay
*  focused on doing the job and
*  also trying to continue to build
*  relationships with diverse sets
*  of interests and people. That's
*  what our system is supposed to
*  be about.
*  It's supposed to be about that.
*  But one of the things that I
*  know other Democrats have pointed
*  to is that the Republican Party
*  under Donald Trump has gone in a
*  particular direction that makes
*  that they feel very, very
*  difficult. So that sounds great
*  to sit and have a beer with your
*  political adversary. But at the
*  same time, there are huge
*  ideological chasms at the moment.
*  There's no question. I mean,
*  it's challenging. I don't ever
*  want to imply that it's easy. It
*  takes work. It takes thick skin
*  and a short memory. And that's a
*  good thing in politics. That's for
*  sure. During the pandemic, when
*  things were really at their
*  hottest, when the former
*  president singled me out and
*  called me that woman from
*  Michigan and I was getting a lot
*  of threats at the time, my
*  Republican-led legislature, who
*  had worked with me pretty well up
*  until that moment, really turned
*  on me. That was the moment when
*  everything kind of changed. I
*  share a picture in the book from
*  the window that I took on my
*  phone when they had a
*  demonstration. People showed up
*  in their cars and shut down the
*  capital city. And they were
*  holding up signs calling me, you
*  know, a Nazi. We saw
*  Confederate flags, saw a Barbie
*  that was dressed like me and
*  hanging from a noose. And it was
*  shocking. I also had a
*  Republican leader who took to
*  calling me names and shared a
*  stage with a lot of the some of
*  the folks that ultimately were
*  tried for the plot to kidnap and
*  kill me. And yet, I had to keep
*  negotiating with that guy
*  because I had to get a budget
*  done. And so I think that that
*  short memory and thick skin is
*  really important if we're going
*  to try to bridge these gaps,
*  because I got a job to do at the
*  end of the day.
*  Let's talk about that era
*  because it was the period when
*  you became a national figure.
*  Very early on, you and then
*  President Trump were at odds, to
*  put it mildly, and you became a
*  symbol of what Republicans saw
*  as draconian pandemic
*  restrictions. You face protests,
*  death threats. You write that
*  you were shocked at how virulent
*  the reaction was. Looking back,
*  why do you think people reacted
*  the way they did so quickly?
*  One of the things that I did
*  during the pandemic was talk to
*  my colleagues a lot, especially
*  my Midwestern group of
*  governors, bipartisan group,
*  Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
*  Wisconsin, Minnesota, and even
*  Kentucky. And it was really
*  helpful for perspective. Every
*  one of us was dealing with some
*  level of that animosity. In
*  swing states, it was even more
*  heightened because of the
*  political dynamic and I think
*  some intentional efforts to
*  really gin it up. But every one
*  of us was dealing with it. When
*  I chatted with Mike DeWine, who
*  is in a Republican controlled
*  state of Ohio, and he's dealing
*  with threats or dealing with
*  anger from his legislature,
*  trying to scale back his
*  executive powers. That was
*  really good for perspective for
*  me. I will say, though, that it
*  was uniquely worse in Michigan.
*  One of my colleagues on our
*  group call said, you know,
*  Gretchen, you're doing a lot of
*  the same things the rest of us
*  are, but why do you take so much
*  more crap for it? And he said,
*  soon as that last word landed,
*  he said, wait, don't answer that
*  question. I know you're the one
*  woman that's doing of this group
*  of governors. And I think it was
*  sexism.
*  Well, that was his theory. And
*  I'm not going to combat that. I
*  do think that that was maybe
*  what made our situation in
*  Michigan stand out.
*  Things went off the rails in
*  Michigan in October 2020. 14 men
*  ended up being arrested for
*  plotting to kidnap you and
*  overthrow the Michigan
*  government. You write in the
*  book that this was referred to
*  in the press as a kidnapping
*  plot. But you say that's not
*  accurate. Can you tell me why
*  not? What do you see it as?
*  I'll tell you in context of
*  another situation that was
*  covered as a assassination
*  attempt. Not long ago, there was
*  a single person that showed up
*  on Justice Kavanaugh's lawn. And
*  it's been covered as an
*  assassination attempt. It was
*  one person. He was
*  apprehended well before any
*  threat really became real to
*  Justice Kavanaugh. And I'm
*  grateful for that. I recognize
*  a threat against anyone, no
*  matter who they are, what
*  their political views is,
*  undermines our system of
*  democracy. And I think that's
*  really important that we all
*  call it out when it happens. The
*  way that was covered versus how
*  12 to 14 people who were
*  plotting over the series of
*  months, who were doing
*  exercises, they had what they
*  called a kill house, running
*  through scenarios about how to
*  kidnap me and kill me. And let's
*  be clear, they weren't going to
*  keep me for ransom. Their
*  intention was to, you know,
*  like a terrorist organization,
*  have a sham trial and then
*  execute me. It was very clear
*  in a lot of their
*  communications. That was the
*  plan. And it was over the
*  series of months, they staked
*  out vacation property that my
*  husband and I have on more than
*  one occasion. They had plots to
*  blow up bridges and kill police
*  officers as well, to even burn
*  down the Capitol, locking the
*  legislature inside. All of that
*  has been labeled a kidnapping
*  plot. And it does feel like it
*  is to discount the
*  seriousness. It was over such a
*  longer period of time, so many
*  more people involved, so many
*  weapons involved. And yet the
*  discrepancy of how that was
*  covered versus how this one
*  person on Justice Kavanaugh's
*  lawn was covered, it was really
*  shocking when you think about
*  it.
*  You write in the book that you
*  want to meet with one of the
*  plotters who pleaded guilty, who
*  is in prison now. What do you
*  want to know?
*  I'd like to understand what
*  drove this group of people to
*  take this extreme position and
*  to try to, to, to, to
*  undergo this exercise to try to
*  kidnap me and kill me. I want to
*  understand it. What is
*  happening?
*  You think there's something to
*  understand?
*  Maybe. Maybe there's not. But
*  I'd like to see. I'd like to
*  know is, is it because there
*  wasn't for that person, economic
*  opportunity? Was it because they
*  got laid off during the
*  pandemic and they were really
*  worried about how they were
*  going to pay, make their house
*  payment? What was it that set
*  them off? It can't just be the
*  fact that we wanted people to
*  wear a mask, because they showed
*  up in masks to be not identified.
*  So it wasn't the act of wearing
*  a mask. But what was it? What
*  was happening that is there a
*  lesson to learn from this?
*  That's what I always want to
*  know.
*  Do you forgive the plotters?
*  I do. And eight of them are
*  doing hard time now. So I think
*  that's important to point out.
*  Some were acquitted.
*  And you write in the book that
*  you think that that was unfair.
*  I'm, I do think that it was, you
*  know, very sad to see such a
*  disparate treatment of people
*  that were a part of the same
*  undertaking. And I think it does
*  us all a disfavor if there's not
*  accountability. But for the ones
*  who took accountability and who
*  shared their remorse and
*  participated with the
*  prosecution, I did ask the judge
*  to take that into account and to
*  recognize that that is a positive
*  outcome. And hopefully that that
*  was reflected in the sentencing.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you, Dr.
*  Lerner.
*  Separate from what happened to
*  you during this period of the
*  pandemic, I do want to ask you
*  about some of the lessons that
*  you may have learned.
*  Michigan's stay at home order
*  did last longer than other
*  states. You closed all the
*  schools in March 2020 and you
*  didn't urge them to be reopened
*  until a year later.
*  Do you think now that we sort of
*  have the fullness of hindsight?
*  Because we know now how profoundly
*  it impacted kids to be out of the
*  classroom.
*  I have said many times that if I
*  could go back in time with the
*  knowledge we've accumulated now,
*  there certainly are things that I
*  would have done differently.
*  I also want to remind everyone
*  that during that period of time,
*  Michigan was so hot compared to
*  the rest of the country.
*  It was New York, Detroit, it was
*  Chicago, and it was New Orleans
*  that were having massive impact
*  from COVID.
*  Our hospitals were at real
*  brink.
*  Of course, you were dealing with
*  the situation and no one really
*  knew how to deal with this.
*  It's less about what you were
*  facing, but more specifically
*  about the impacts of schools.
*  You're seeing it in Michigan,
*  chronic absenteeism, students
*  performing below pre-pandemic
*  levels in reading and math.
*  So just applying that as the
*  current governor, what do you see
*  maybe the lessons are of that
*  period, particularly when it
*  comes to kids in schools?
*  I think we have to remember that
*  we were looking at lessons from
*  the Spanish flu and recognizing
*  that we hadn't dealt with a
*  global pandemic in a hundred
*  years, that that particular
*  virus absolutely was devastating
*  to younger people.
*  And as a person taking in as
*  much information as I could from
*  our epidemiologists and our
*  public health experts, the
*  thought that we might have a lot
*  of school-aged kids that were
*  going to die from this virus, I
*  think was really what motivated
*  our actions and the actions of
*  lots of governors when we stopped
*  kids going to school.
*  It was, it has had carried a
*  long, hard price tag with it.
*  We've made massive investments
*  in early childhood and in free
*  breakfast and lunch for all 1.4
*  million Michigan kids and
*  literacy coaches.
*  And so we're working to help get
*  our kids back on track.
*  But absolutely, if I could go
*  back in time with the knowledge
*  we have now and knowing this
*  virus didn't disproportionately
*  kill children, would I have
*  done some things differently?
*  Yes.
*  Staying in Michigan, one of the
*  more recent issues, it's fair to
*  say, that you struggled with is
*  a conflict in Gaza.
*  Michigan has the second largest
*  population of Arab Americans in
*  the country.
*  There was a huge movement to
*  vote uncommitted to protest the
*  Biden administration's handling
*  of the conflict.
*  And in some Arab American
*  communities, up to three
*  quarters of Democrats cast their
*  votes as uncommitted.
*  Do you worry that the protest
*  vote will translate into
*  meaningful erosion of Biden's
*  support?
*  I think one of the really
*  important lessons right now is
*  everyone's hurting.
*  The only universal truth here in
*  the States is that everyone's
*  hurting.
*  We're watching what's happening,
*  the loss of life.
*  It's profound.
*  The hostages that are still in
*  captivity, the remains of
*  hostages who've not survived.
*  So I do think that it was
*  important for people who
*  disagree with the policy to be
*  able to make an outward
*  statement of that through that
*  vote.
*  I also think it's important to
*  recognize we've got a high
*  stakes election coming up.
*  We know that this is a very
*  stark choice in front of us and
*  there are going to be
*  generational impacts from the
*  outcome of this election.
*  And so I'm doing everything I
*  can to make sure that
*  Michiganders and all of these
*  communities feel seen, heard,
*  respected, and reflected in the
*  policies of President Biden.
*  I mean, what does that look
*  like?
*  Because recent polling has shown
*  that among Muslim and Arab
*  American voters, Trump is
*  leading Biden by 32 points.
*  That's a huge defection from
*  2020.
*  So how are you addressing that?
*  What we have seen, at least in
*  so many of the conversations
*  that I've had on the ground in
*  Michigan, is this is a community
*  that takes umbrage with the, to
*  put it lightly, with the
*  president's policies.
*  That being said, I hear
*  routinely that they also
*  recognize that a vote for
*  Donald Trump is a vote for
*  someone who pushed a Muslim
*  ban, who talks about countries
*  with people of color and
*  incredibly harsh and cruel
*  terms.
*  I think that making sure that
*  people come out and vote is
*  going to be the important focus
*  of our work going into the
*  fall election.
*  And I don't take any vote for
*  granted and I don't think that
*  the Biden administration does
*  either.
*  Last question about Gaza, which
*  is a bit of a personal one.
*  We've seen a lot of college
*  activism.
*  You have two college-age
*  daughters.
*  One just graduated from
*  Michigan and one is still a
*  student there.
*  What have they been telling you
*  about what's going on in
*  campus?
*  Well, I'm glad that I've got a
*  22 year old and a 20 year old
*  who are very confident and
*  invested and vocal.
*  And I learn as much from my kids
*  as I do anybody.
*  And I'm grateful.
*  You know, my daughter, my oldest
*  called me early on, probably
*  late last fall.
*  And she was really upset about
*  the deaths in Gaza and the
*  escalating loss of innocent
*  lives.
*  Jarred by what happened October
*  7th without question and then
*  the ongoing loss.
*  I've asked her questions.
*  You know, she's got a wonderful
*  diverse group of friends.
*  This generation sees, I think,
*  the humanitarian need and is
*  very motivated to call on our
*  leaders to address the crisis
*  that is playing out every
*  single day.
*  And so I am very appreciative
*  of their advocacy and activity.
*  And I think it's emblematic of
*  what we're seeing across our
*  younger generation.
*  So you think the protests on
*  campuses were a legitimate
*  expression of that?
*  Some of them were.
*  Some of them crossed the line.
*  You know, it's funny, as we've
*  been talking, it strikes me
*  that we've been talking about
*  issues in Michigan, but they're
*  all so resonant to the national
*  stage.
*  Right.
*  And your state is such a
*  microcosm of what is happening
*  in different parts of this
*  country.
*  And, you know, you are one of
*  the co-chairs of the Biden
*  reelection campaign.
*  As we're speaking today, you
*  just came from the White House.
*  And obviously the president's
*  age has been an issue for
*  voters.
*  And there's been a lot of
*  questions about his mental
*  fitness.
*  He's 81 years old.
*  Pretending that this isn't an
*  issue hasn't really been working
*  for Democrats.
*  I mean, it is an issue for
*  voters.
*  Do you see it as a legitimate
*  concern?
*  And how should Democrats be
*  talking about it?
*  Well, one of the things I know
*  is you can't tell people how to
*  feel and you can't tell people
*  to ignore something they are
*  questioning or they're
*  interested in.
*  I think it's important to
*  recognize, yes, the two leading
*  standard bearers for the two big
*  political parties in this
*  country are both, you know, 80
*  ish, right?
*  That's an inescapable fact.
*  One has got a record of
*  delivering incredibly for the
*  people of our country.
*  The CHIPS Act, the IRA, the
*  investment that's happening on
*  shoring supply chains and the
*  investment on bridges and roads
*  all across this country.
*  President Biden has a record of
*  delivering and that's the kind
*  of leadership, I think, that we
*  will see for the next four years
*  if he's reelected.
*  On the contrary, the other 80 ish
*  year old is someone who has not
*  articulated any sort of vision
*  for our country, someone who has
*  been more about dividing us,
*  someone who, when they don't
*  like someone, will attack them
*  and mobilize their supporters to
*  threaten them, someone who has
*  only talked about grievance and
*  vengeance.
*  And I think people want a leader
*  who is going to make their lives
*  better, who is going to work at
*  it every single day.
*  President Biden has shown that
*  he is that person and he's the
*  only person that falls into that
*  category in this race for
*  president.
*  So I'm hearing the message
*  there.
*  It does make me think, though,
*  something you do write a lot
*  about in the book is the power
*  of messaging, the power of how
*  you articulate a vision.
*  It's something that you were
*  very proud of in 2017 and 2018.
*  Your slogan was, fix the damn
*  roads.
*  I learned a lot about Michigan
*  roads reading your book.
*  I want to say that I didn't know.
*  But my editor had to Google to
*  find out what Biden's slogan this
*  year was.
*  And it is, finish the job, which
*  I have to say is not much of a
*  humdinger.
*  I'm curious if you have sharper
*  ideas, because you seem to be
*  good at this.
*  And right now, Democrats
*  nationally are really struggling
*  with messaging about where the
*  party stands.
*  When I talk to voters, they
*  really have trouble articulating
*  what Democrats are going to do
*  for them.
*  I think that I talked to a lot of
*  my colleagues.
*  Governors, I think, know what's
*  going on in their states better
*  than anybody.
*  We all get asked, what about the
*  national messaging?
*  And I think a national message is
*  always a challenge.
*  Washington, D.C. is so far away
*  from the average person's life
*  that to conceptualize what a
*  three trillion dollar investment
*  in onshore and supply chains
*  means to your everyday life is
*  darn near impossible to discern.
*  And that's why I've always learned
*  when you show up and ask people,
*  they're going to tell you what
*  they want.
*  They're going to tell you what
*  they need and they're going to
*  use the language that they use.
*  Fix the damn roads was not
*  something that we poll tested or
*  focus group.
*  It was just conversation after
*  conversation.
*  What do you need me to do if I'm
*  elected?
*  Fix the damn roads.
*  But Governor Whitmer, it's ironic
*  because President Biden passed an
*  infrastructure bill.
*  He is fixing the damn roads.
*  That's right.
*  And bridges and Internet.
*  Right. But he's not getting
*  credit for it.
*  I mean, why do you think that is
*  for that same reason?
*  Right.
*  I think the pandemic's taken a
*  toll. People are stressed out.
*  They're just trying to pay the
*  grocery bill, get the kids off to
*  school, show up at their job and
*  maybe get a little bit of sleep
*  at night.
*  They're not consuming everything.
*  They can't discern what the Chips
*  Act has meant.
*  And so we got to tell that story
*  better. There's no question that
*  that's maybe one of the most
*  important, biggest challenges
*  for us going into this election.
*  But in many ways, this is the kind
*  of vibes election.
*  I mean, when you poll people and
*  you ask them, what is the economy
*  doing? They think it's in
*  recession. How is the stock
*  market doing? They think it's
*  down. There isn't a real
*  understanding of even where the
*  country is at.
*  So then how do you reach those
*  people?
*  Well, an interesting thing, too,
*  is in some of the most recent
*  research, individuals feel like
*  their situation is pretty good.
*  But the rest of the economy is
*  not good.
*  And that's the absolute inverse
*  of what generally you see.
*  People feel like, OK, I'm not
*  doing good, but everyone else
*  seems to be getting ahead.
*  It's the inverse.
*  It's a strange phenomenon.
*  I don't know how to explain it,
*  but I do know we've got to make
*  sure that people appreciate all
*  the different things that are
*  happening in their communities
*  because of the work that President
*  Biden has done.
*  So last question.
*  Biden is behind in many polls,
*  and certainly it is close in
*  swing states like yours.
*  He is losing ground to young
*  people, black and brown voters.
*  As we record this, the polls are
*  pretty tight in Michigan.
*  It's a must-win state.
*  Do you feel pressure to deliver
*  the state? Can you?
*  Well, in 2022, we absolutely ran
*  up our numbers one by 11 points
*  and flipped the legislature in
*  the process.
*  We showed up everywhere.
*  That is going to be even more
*  important now than ever.
*  I do always know that there's a
*  path to victory through Michigan.
*  It's going to be a little more
*  challenging this cycle, but
*  we've rolled up our sleeves.
*  We're not going to get
*  distracted.
*  We don't celebrate small leads
*  in polls.
*  We don't fall apart when there's
*  a small lead on the other side
*  in a poll.
*  It's Michigan.
*  It's going to be tight all the
*  way through the election.
*  We're going to do the work and I
*  feel confident we're going to be
*  able to win this race.
*  Rich Whitmer, thank you so much.
*  I look forward to our next
*  conversation.
*  Me too.
*  Thank you.
*  After the break, I call the
*  governor back to get her take on
*  a few specific issues, including
*  reproductive rights.
*  Every American woman and her
*  family and health care providers
*  deserve to know that this
*  fundamental question around
*  health care is bested solely in
*  the individual and that's going
*  to have to happen at the federal
*  level.
*  So I do believe we've got to
*  continue and I do believe that's
*  why this upcoming election is
*  such high stakes.
*  Hi, Governor Whitmer.
*  It's Lulu.
*  Hi.
*  Where are you right now?
*  Where am I catching you?
*  Right now I am in Detroit.
*  The great city of Detroit.
*  Governor, we only have a little
*  bit of time, so I want to jump
*  right in.
*  Great.
*  So I'm guessing that you're not
*  going to tell me if you're
*  running for president in 2028,
*  right?
*  I don't know what the heck I'm
*  going to do in 2028.
*  So you can tell me.
*  I'm going to tell you.
*  I'm going to tell you.
*  I'm going to tell you.
*  I'm going to tell you.
*  So you can ask, but that's the
*  honest answer.
*  That's fair.
*  But you're clearly preparing
*  for a bigger role on the
*  national stage.
*  You are term limited.
*  Your term ends in 2026.
*  So I do want to sort of
*  understand how you think about
*  some key issues.
*  And after our last conversation,
*  I was thinking about how we
*  really didn't get to dig into
*  reproductive rights.
*  And I wanted to ask you on a
*  national level, Roe isn't
*  coming back.
*  You know, Congress has been
*  unable to pass legislation
*  protecting contraception, much
*  less abortion.
*  Do you see any way to protect
*  abortion at the national level?
*  Well, I do.
*  And I think ultimately that's
*  got to be the goal right now.
*  You know, we've seen it all
*  across the country when people
*  get an opportunity to weigh in.
*  They overwhelmingly, you know,
*  vote to enshrine abortion rights.
*  We saw it in in Ohio.
*  We saw it in Wisconsin with
*  their Supreme Court election.
*  We saw it in Michigan.
*  A 10 year quest to undo
*  legislation that made it more
*  difficult for women to access
*  abortion and health care.
*  I got to sign the repeal of that
*  into law in the wake of us
*  amending our constitution to
*  protect abortion rights.
*  And talk about that in the book,
*  how personally gutted I was when
*  I shared my story of being a
*  sexual assault survivor.
*  Didn't make a damn difference on
*  the debate.
*  But 10 years later, as governor,
*  we flipped the legislature.
*  We stayed at it.
*  And ultimately I got to sign the
*  repeal. Now, these are overarching
*  issues. We don't solve them
*  overnight, but the fight is
*  worth having.
*  What I'm hearing you say is that
*  the only way to really resolve
*  this now is going state by state.
*  And as you know, that's going to
*  lead to basically a
*  patchwork situation
*  where some women will be able to
*  have the right to reproductive
*  freedom and some women won't
*  because of where they live.
*  Which is why, you know, at this
*  point, this is where we can make
*  progress in this moment
*  by enshrining it where we have
*  those tools. But at the end of the
*  day, every American woman
*  and her family and health care
*  providers deserve to know that
*  this fundamental question
*  around health care is
*  vested solely in the individual.
*  And that's going to have to happen
*  at the federal level.
*  So I do believe that's why
*  this upcoming election has such
*  high stakes, not just
*  for abortion rights, but certainly
*  abortion rights are at the heart of
*  a lot of what we're talking about
*  individual freedoms.
*  Speaking of that, you know, the
*  Supreme Court has been mired in
*  controversy, especially around
*  Justices Alito and Thomas.
*  Do you think they need to recuse
*  themselves from rulings on
*  anything to do with the 2020
*  election and President Trump?
*  Well, you know, as a lawyer,
*  my understanding is that,
*  you know, that would be
*  appropriate.
*  The Supreme Court
*  operates under their own rules.
*  I think it's really something
*  that that gives me great
*  anxiety is this distrust
*  in institutions that have
*  sustained this democracy for so
*  long. And we
*  sadly have seen so many
*  Americans get persuaded
*  by, I think,
*  false information and
*  undermine our institutions.
*  And then when you see justices
*  that appear to have real conflict,
*  not recuse themselves, that
*  further erodes our confidence
*  in these institutions that
*  sustain this democracy.
*  And it's very concerning.
*  Yes.
*  Do you think the court needs to be
*  expanded then?
*  I mean, because it's a 6-3
*  majority. And if things like
*  abortion rights, for example,
*  are ever going to be reconsidered,
*  the current makeup of the court
*  isn't one that is favorable
*  to Democrats.
*  You know, Lilloo, we're
*  stepping way outside of, you know,
*  my expertise as a legal
*  mind. But I would just say this,
*  whether or not the court gets
*  expanded or whether or not,
*  you know, we just ensure that
*  President Biden is the one in that
*  office who makes the next
*  handful of appointments.
*  All of these things work toward the
*  same end of restoring some
*  integrity into
*  our government, which is desperately
*  needed.
*  Moving to another subject, it
*  does seem that 2028 is
*  going to necessarily see a changing
*  of the guard.
*  What do you hope your generation of
*  politicians can do for the country?
*  So I'm 52, almost 53.
*  And, you know, as I talk to
*  my fellow Gen Xers.
*  Best generation.
*  Yeah, we recognize that,
*  you know, our parents generation
*  has had a lot of excess
*  and certainly I worry about
*  so many of the decisions that were
*  made prior to my kids generation
*  and what they are worried about.
*  And so I'm hopeful that we can
*  really move the needle, whether it's
*  around bringing down
*  our nation's debt or
*  ensuring that we are active when it
*  comes to climate and solidifying
*  and protecting individual rights.
*  These are really the existential
*  issues that my kids generation is
*  worried about, gun violence, etc.
*  And so I'm hopeful that
*  in 2028, we see a Gen
*  Xers running for the White
*  House and let someone from my
*  generation is ready to take the
*  mantle.
*  My last question is about
*  Trump.
*  You know, he is a convicted felon
*  now.
*  And even if he doesn't win
*  the election, Trumpism
*  as a political movement seems like
*  it's here to stay.
*  Do you agree with that? Do you think
*  his ideas and his vision will outlast
*  him?
*  I don't know.
*  I'm not sure, to be honest, Lulu.
*  I think that
*  there are still a lot of Republicans
*  out there who would not identify
*  as Trump supporters, but
*  are not willing to relinquish their
*  party. They're fighting to bring
*  back some common sense
*  and more traditional
*  viewpoints and values to the party.
*  And I'm hopeful that they're
*  successful because I do think it's
*  important for our system
*  of governance to have robust
*  debates with people of different
*  perspectives.
*  I miss having pro-choice
*  Republicans in Michigan in
*  government.
*  I miss being able to have
*  thoughtful debates and then
*  ultimately find common ground.
*  I'm always striving for it, but it's
*  a lot more challenging.
*  And, you know, I think the average
*  person in this country expects
*  that of us.
*  And so I'm hopeful
*  that this is a chapter,
*  but not a trajectory.
*  Governor Whitmer, thank you so much
*  for your time. I really appreciate
*  it.
*  Thanks, Lulu.
*  That's Governor Gretchen Whitmer.
*  True Gretch, what I've learned about
*  life, leadership and everything in
*  between will be out on July 9th.

*  I remember

*  It was me, Belushi and Robin
*  Williams. They'd take Coke out,
*  start doing Coke.
*  And I was like, oh, no, I'm cool.
*  And
*  every now and then over the years,
*  I trip about that moment because I
*  was really young and it was so easy

*  I wasn't taking some moral stance,
