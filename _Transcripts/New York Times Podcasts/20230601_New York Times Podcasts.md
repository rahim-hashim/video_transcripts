*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Babarro. This is a deal.
*  Today, with stunning speed, the status of trans youth has become the rallying cry of
*  the Republican Party from state legislatures to presidential campaigns.
*  My colleague, Adam Nagarri, has been reporting unprecisely how that came to be and why it's
*  proven such a potent issue. It's Thursday, June 1st.
*  Adam over the past few months, it has felt like the Republican Party at every level has
*  made what very much looks like a concerted decision to focus its attention, its rhetoric,
*  and its political power on transgender identity and trans rights. And you have been studying
*  that strategy closely. So put it into context for us, the scale of it.
*  You know, it's as big as you think it is. We're seeing across the country that Republicans
*  are talking about this, leading candidates for the 2024 presidential race are already
*  releasing campaign ads.
*  It's morning again in America. One of them being Donald Trump, who specifically mentioned
*  trans people in sports, mediocre male athletes now given the opportunity to compete unfairly.
*  We've seen politicians at every level across the country again, Republicans, using similar
*  language.
*  Girls are going to play girl sports and boys are going to play boy sports. That's what
*  we're doing. That girls should be girls and boys should be boys. And the largest gathering
*  of conservatives, CPAC, earlier this year was very much dominated by this issue.
*  If transgenderism is false, as it is, then for the good of society and especially for
*  the good of the poor people who have fallen prey to this confusion, trans-genderism must
*  be eradicated from public life entirely.
*  But it's more than rhetoric. We're seeing actual legislation passing. We've had a bunch
*  of states over this past year that have passed laws that have restricted the ability of
*  minors to get access to healthcare or compete on sports teams. So it's been really a big
*  deal in my view of my senses that it's just good to grow.
*  Well, Adam, to the degree that this really has been the year where this issue came to
*  ahead and reached a critical mass and for Republicans has found real success, especially
*  in the form of legislation, we want to talk to you about how that came to be.
*  How did Republicans come to agree that this issue, kids who identify as trans, is the
*  issue that they would put so much money and muscle behind in this moment. So tell us what
*  you have come to understand about that.
*  It's partly organic. It partly just kind of happened for a variety of reasons. And it's
*  partly part of a well-organized effort to put this on the map. I think it goes back
*  to 2015 when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage. And that was obviously
*  a big victory for gay rights groups that have been fighting for that for a long time.
*  And I would argue kind of a surprise that they're legal and political success in getting
*  it through and getting such widespread acceptance to it.
*  Now there are a few things that are going on here. What is it? The most well-funded mainstream
*  gay rights groups, like the Human Rights Campaign, Lambda Legal Defense Fund, the Victory Fund,
*  they've been around for a long time. And in their history, they tended to be formed
*  by overwhelmingly white male middle-class people, not exclusively, but predominantly.
*  And they don't represent the entire gay rights movement, certainly not the gay rights
*  movement that we see today. But they're prominent and they have money and they have influence.
*  And the truth is, some of them have been uncomfortable with trans issues going back at least to
*  so long. And I say that as someone who's actually studied this and actually wrote a book about
*  this. And just explain that Adam, I mean, because we all understand this acronym, LGBTQ,
*  you're suggesting that there's something of a complex inner dynamic between those letters,
*  gay and trans. There is a complex inner dynamic. I don't think we should assume that some
*  of these gay rights groups would automatically move to trans issues. At the same time, once
*  that court made a decision, they were without an issue that they had used to organize and
*  to raise money and to rally support for years. So they needed to figure out what to do next.
*  And you could see this sort of trend toward embracing trans issues. And it began around
*  that. Right. I remember this moment really well. Adam, I remember covering the legalization
*  of gay marriage for the times. And it was something that was talked about somewhat openly
*  that with gay marriage past, the gay rights movement had achieved this major milestone
*  in social acceptance. And the feeling was that for these groups that you just described,
*  the next natural logical place to advocate was for trans people who did not win the same
*  kind of rights during that period that gay men and women had. I think that's right. And
*  this became, you know, a really clear issue for these groups to rally around. So yes,
*  I think that's correct. Okay. So what does that start to look like? All of these organizations
*  and infrastructure that had been focused on gay rights suddenly turning their attention to trans
*  rights. So you start seeing the same organizations that had been lobbying for gay marriage, turn
*  their attention to laws that were protect trans people. History was made today when the Defense
*  Department lifted one of the last bands on service in the armed forces. So this is when the
*  Pentagon lists the ban on trans people serving openly in the military. And they will be eligible
*  for any medically necessary care, including surgery. And big changes to drivers licenses and IDs
*  in California and New York. Some local governments start lifting the requirement that people choose
*  a gender identification when, you know, applying for a driver's license. Oregon, Maine, Minnesota,
*  Washington State and Washington, DC already offer three gender classifications. And at the same
*  time, we're seeing more changes culturally in society in terms of transgender visibility.
*  Ladies, I want each and every one of you to go back to your bunk tonight and get to know your own
*  child child. Okay. So the show, Orange is the new black features a trans actress.
*  You see, that is history being made, Lever and Cox from Orange is the new black. It's the first
*  transgender person to make the cover of time. And then of course, in 2015, Bruce always had to tell
*  a lie, Caitlin doesn't have any secrets. Caitlin Jenner was on the cover of Vanity Fair.
*  Soon as the Vanity Fair cover comes out, I'm free. It was a real moment. And you can be sure that
*  those on the political right notice the change.
*  In what way? Well, I think they began at that moment to realize there might be a political
*  issue here where the American public in general was becoming supportive of same sex marriage.
*  But they certainly were not supportive of some of these issues or at least familiar or comfortable
*  with them. This was new territory. And Michael, let me take a pause here. I want to make an
*  important distinction. I think for some on the right, this was a matter of genuine concern.
*  But there were somewhere this was also a political decision or a calculated decision.
*  They saw this as a potent issue. And they began to realize that this could replace gay marriage
*  as something that could help them organize, raise money, get attention, become relevant.
*  Both sides after gay marriage is legalized are moving on. One to trans rights to champion it,
*  the other to try to counter it and express awareness of it. I think that's right. And I think
*  that the same way the left saw there was something it could pivot to in terms of gay right issues.
*  The right saw something that they could do to replace this big issue they had lost.
*  Okay. So what does the right do about trans people and their sudden much more visible
*  emergence in American life in this period? So we all love to impose narratives on things that
*  just sort of happen organically and isn't quite that clean. But what happens if you have a
*  sort of constellation of conservative groups that have been working on social causes over the years
*  and up until this point that had been basically gay marriage and abortion. And their groups like
*  the Family Research Council, the Alliance Defending Freedom, the American Principles Project,
*  and an early attempt to turn this concern into action backfired. And it backfired spectacularly.
*  How so? So in North Carolina, legislators voted to bar trans gender people from using
*  public bathrooms of their choice. And it created a huge political and economic backlash. And
*  you had businesses like PayPal and Adidas pulling out, not investing in the state,
*  the NCAA and the NBA pull back. Performers like Bruce Springsteen canceled concerts. And it
*  culminated with the lawmakers backing down and eventually rescinding the bill.
*  Right. The reaction to that bill from businesses, from performers was outranged.
*  Right. Like how could you do this? And it became a kind of economic pressure on North
*  Carolina. I think I remember covering this that was so enormous that the lawmakers in North
*  Carolina kind of scurried back to the drawing board and said, oh, that was a mistake.
*  Exactly right. I guess the issue of bathrooms just wasn't resonating with the public at
*  the time. So some conservative strategists began looking around for other ways to frame
*  transgender rights as an issue that could be winning for the Republican party.
*  Okay. And what happens in pursuit of that next trans battleground for Republicans?
*  So I said point out here that we have an interregnum Donald Trump is elected president at the
*  end of 2016. And you know, as president, he was definitely an early ally of this movement.
*  Right. And he did stuff like rescind that Obama policy on transgender people serving in the
*  military. That turned out just to be the beginning for the Trump administration. They moved on to
*  narrow the definition of sex discrimination in education and in housing. So transgender people
*  are not considered a protected class. Right. So I think a lot of these groups felt kind of
*  comfortable what was going on. Then the less they were still doing research. And in 2019,
*  these groups did polling. They found that Republicans were more likely to support a Republican candidate
*  who favored a ban on transgender girls participating in sports that a candidate pushing for a ban
*  on transgender people using bathroom with their choosing. Interesting. Yeah. So they realized that
*  there was a power to the issue of fairness in sports and to the medical issue. Like should
*  trans teenagers, minors have access to what's known as gender or affirming care. And what I mean by
*  that is a range of treatments that can include mental health support, hormone therapy,
*  puberty blockers, and in rare cases, surgery. So the polls were definitely part of what led them
*  to shift from bathrooms to these issues. And both of those issues, we should point out at them,
*  involve not just any trans person, but trans youths, trans youths in sports and trans youths
*  seeking medical care for being trans. Yeah. I think that's a big deal. I think that these groups
*  have been casting around for how to deal with this issue and suddenly saw a clear path forward. And
*  in both these examples, we both use it involves kids. And of course, it's around this time, Adam,
*  that more and more young people are starting to identify as trans. I mean, the Times reported on it
*  during this period, numbers are starting to emerge showing that the trans community
*  among young Americans is expanded. Yeah. You know, that's right. There was one study based on
*  government data from 2017 to 2020 that estimated that 1.4% of kids who were from 13 to 17 years old
*  identified as transgender and 1.3 of 18 to 24 year olds. Now, 1% is not a big percentage,
*  but the numbers are growing. And I think the reason the numbers are growing is because in some parts of
*  the country, it's more acceptable to come out as transgender and care is more accessible.
*  And medical professionals will tell you that kids do need this kind of treatment at this point in
*  their life when there are a lot of changes going on in their bodies. And it makes sense from that
*  perspective to delay some of these changes until these minors can come to terms with what exactly
*  they want to do in terms of transition. And we're not talking about many kids getting medical treatment,
*  the best numbers we have show that maybe 4,000 kids began a hormone therapy in 2021.
*  But it was going on and it's caught the eye of conservatives and they're comfortable with the idea
*  of trans people in general and they're uncomfortable with the idea of kids transitioning.
*  So it made sense, you know, both for a policy perspective and from a political perspective,
*  the Republicans seized on trans youth as an issue. And there's a history to framing these kind
*  of issues around children. Well, explain that Adam, what do you mean?
*  This is nothing new. The idea of conservatives who oppose gay rights, speaking generally,
*  framing the issue around children has been going on at least since the 1970s,
*  most famously is what a prominent singer actress named Anita Bryant in Florida.
*  Anita Bryant is not reluctant to use her show business background during her public appearances
*  on behalf of Save Our Children. Let a campaign against gay rights by portraying gay men as
*  predators of children. Save our children. We do not want our children subjected to this kind of a
*  role model. And it was very effective. I'm not talking necessarily of child molestation in the
*  physical. I'm talking about the psychological, which is even more detrimental. Time and time again
*  over these past decades, and as particularly as we saw the gay rights women shift to barrage,
*  redefine a marriage would further distance marriage from the needs of children.
*  When conservatives trying to derail these efforts would raise questions about how children
*  would be raised by having same sex parents. It would deny as a matter of policy the ideal
*  that a child needs a mom and a dad. And I think that's even more of the case now with trans issues,
*  particularly trans minor issues and conservatives understand that.
*  Right. You're saying this approach by conservatives of focusing on kids
*  worked early on in fighting gay rights. So it stands to reason that it would work against
*  trans rights. And if you're a conservative worried about trans rights, the reality is that the
*  culture and politics around trans people and trans rights are changing very quickly after 2015.
*  So that's how we arrive at this moment and this strategy by Republicans. It's not coming out
*  of nowhere. It doesn't come from nowhere. It really important point here is that these
*  concerns are not only felt by conservatives, they're also felt by some independent voters and
*  even some democratic voters. All the stuff came together at once. Conservative groups kind of stumbled
*  into this. I mean, they've been thinking about this for a long time and partly by planning and
*  partly just because stuff happens, they have stumbled across an issue that has real residents
*  and they realize it. And now the time has come to try to codify it in state legislatures across the
*  country.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Okay, Adam, you've explained how by 2019, a group of conservative activists have found their issue
*  and their strategy, which is to focus on trans kids. So how did they begin to deploy that strategy
*  across the country? What do they do? Well, before they can even get going, two things happen that
*  really changed the political atmosphere in the country and made it, I say, more amenable to their
*  message. The first, of course, was the pandemic and that created skepticism about medicine,
*  about medical professionals. So when organizations like the American Medical Association or
*  the American Academy of Pediatrics say they support gender of farming care for trans miners,
*  there are a lot of people who just discount that or just don't believe them or just trust them.
*  The kind of organizations that would have had a lot of credibility 20 years ago just don't in
*  this new world. Right. And then of course, at the end of 2020, Donald Trump loses the election.
*  And what that means is that there's not anyone in the white house anymore who's going to carry
*  at this agenda out of federal level and they're forced to turn to the state legislatures.
*  Where, of course, they start turning this approach we've been discussing into actual law. So
*  remind us exactly what these bills try to do and in which states they pass. So we begin seeing
*  these bills popping up all over the country. And it's hard not to notice that they are often
*  similar in language. And that's because some of them are being drafted off of model legislation
*  that was put together by some of these conservative groups that have been leading the battle against
*  transgender rights for a while. And once they help state lawmakers write these bills, they lobby
*  to get a pass. This week, Arkansas lawmakers passed a first-in-a-nation bill.
*  In early 2021, Arkansas became the first state to ban gender-affirming care for minors.
*  New tonight, Arizona's transgender youth have become a target at the state capital this year.
*  And that was followed by Arizona and Alabama. The law would make providing that care a felony
*  punishable by up to 10 years in prison. And as of this tabing, governors in Utah in South Dakota
*  sign legislation banning gender-affirming care into law. Georgia and Iowa have become the latest
*  states to enact anti-trans laws. The most high profile new state added to the list is Florida.
*  Over a dozen states have restricted access to medical care for minors up from just three in January.
*  More than 426 bills that have been described as anti-LGBTQ laws have been introduced in state
*  legislatures across the U.S. And some of these bills go even further. A record number of bills
*  relating to health care access to bathrooms, even drag performances, have already been
*  tabled this year in state legislatures. So it's been a big change.
*  And talk to us for just a moment about the practical impact of all these new laws. Because
*  at this time, we're now talking about at least 16 states with restrictions or bans on gender
*  affirming care for minors and more than 20 states that have some kind of a sports ban.
*  I mean, I think what it means is that any minor who identifies as transgender or is searching
*  to determine their gender identity and lives in a state where this is actively discursive,
*  it's going to find life is difficult. I mean, it's going to be harder to seek help.
*  It's going to be harder to join sports teams. It's going to be harder to get hormone therapy
*  or other gender affirming care. And in some states, some kids who are already getting these
*  treatments are going to be forced to stop. It's just making it more difficult for them to live the
*  way they want to live. And activists say they put trans kids at serious risk.
*  Adam, as all this has been happening, what is the LGBTQ rights movement that was so successful
*  in the past doing to try to fend off these laws?
*  I mean, we have to use that they cannot do much legislatively to change this. These states are
*  controlled by Republicans, legislators and governors. The sentiment is really strong.
*  There's just not much you can do to change the laws in the legislature, but you can go to court.
*  And some of these groups are taking these laws to court with mixed success trying to at least
*  slow them down. And advocates are doing what they can in the blue states to protect and bolster
*  trans rights. The result is that we're having two very different countries here. It's very different
*  to be a trans person living in a red state than a trans person living in a blue state.
*  And we started this conversation in 2015 and with gay rights and the success of gay marriage.
*  A big way that gay rights activists overcame fear and antipathy of gay rights was by focusing on
*  adults and a very traditional request, the right of gay adults to be married. And that ultimately
*  is seen as having melted the opposition to gay rights. I wonder how much the trans rights world
*  thinks about that as a model. And about the idea that they're likely to keep suffering
*  political and legislative setbacks if this debate is being framed as it now is by Republicans
*  around kids and young people. Yeah, I mean like history shows and social conservatives know
*  that focusing on kids is an effective and powerful way to frame this argument and ultimately
*  to win this argument. Now if these policies start to encroach on the rights of trans adults
*  and I have to point out in some places they already have begun, then social conservatives might
*  lose support. Certainly I would argue among independent or moderate voters. But for now,
*  the vast majority of laws remain focused squarely on kids under 18.
*  Right. And so long as that remains the case, it's going to present a real challenge for trans rights
*  advocates. That's correct. I mean, it's a conundrum for them, right? For trans advocates,
*  it's a huge issue. You can't really turn away from kids because part of what we're talking about
*  here is being a kid and growing up as a potentially transgender kid and they want to protect kids at
*  the stage of their life when they're undergoing puberty and their identities are beginning to
*  emerge. And how do we get out of that dilemma? That's the situation we're in right now and my gut is
*  at this debate. It's going to be centered on trans kids for a long time to come.
*  Adam, thank you very much. Thank you Michael. I appreciate it.
*  It's wrong for a teacher to tell a student that they may have been born in the wrong body or that
*  their gender is a choice. On Wednesday, Republican governor Ron DeSantis of Florida began his newly
*  announced presidential campaign in Iowa by talking about trans kids and his efforts to keep
*  any discussion of them out of public schools. We actually just find legislation to protect these
*  students from having teachers force them to pick pronouns, which they are doing in some parts of
*  this country at very, very young age. We're not competing in the pronounciest days. We're going to have
*  school. The issue is expected to be central to DeSantis's candidacy and to the larger battle for
*  who becomes the Republican presidential nominee in 2024.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need. Ten other day.
*  On Wednesday night, the Republican controlled house passed a controversial plan to raise the
*  debt ceiling and avoid a US financial default. But in an embarrassing political setback for Republican
*  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who broke the deal with President Biden, 71 House Republicans voted
*  against it, saying it failed to reduce federal spending by enough. As a result, it fell to Democrats
*  to push the Republican bill over the line. In the end, more than 165 Democrats voted for the plan,
*  compared with just 149 Republicans, a fact that House Democratic minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries,
*  was eager to highlight. The street mega Republicans attempted to take control of the House floor.
*  Democrats took it back for the American people. The bill now heads to the Senate,
*  where Democratic majority leader Chuck Schumer said it will be adopted before June 5th,
*  when the US is expected to hit the debt ceiling and run out of money.
