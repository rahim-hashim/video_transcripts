# Why a Coup in Niger Has the Worldâ€™s Attention
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u-QoTaiGb4)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro.
*  This is a daily.
*  Today, in a region known for rising authoritarianism and extremism, the African country of Niger
*  seemed to be on a different path of democracy and partnership with the United States.
*  My colleague Declan Walsh explains how a military coup has now put all of that in jeopardy,
*  and why Niger's allies still think it's possible to reverse that coup.
*  It's Wednesday, August 16th.
*  Declan, we called you a couple of days ago to talk about a coup that had just occurred
*  in Africa, a not entirely uncommon occurrence on that continent.
*  You told us without much hesitation that this coup has taken on global importance in a way
*  that's quite unique.
*  Yes, that's right.
*  It's no secret that coups have been common in Africa.
*  There's probably been a hundred in the post-independence period the last 60 years.
*  In the region known as the Sahel, which is this huge zone that runs south of the Sahara
*  Desert stretching across the continent, there's been five coups in the last three years alone.
*  Candidly, the world shrugs when many of those coups happen.
*  As you said, what happened in Niger in the last couple of weeks is very different.
*  It's been called a red line coup, a coup that the US and its European allies and several
*  major regional African countries have said that they cannot tolerate, and they're now
*  demanding something very unusual.
*  They want it to be reversed.
*  Why is that?
*  Why are all these powerful countries so invested in and worried about this particular coup
*  above all these other coups in the past?
*  Well, I think a lot of it has to do with the president of Niger.
*  He's this guy who the US and its allies have really invested in in recent years.
*  His name is Mohammed Bazoum.
*  He is the first leader of Niger who has assumed power through what they call a peaceful democratic
*  transition.
*  In other words, he took power from another elected leader in 2021.
*  Bazoum is also someone who has adopted what you might call Western values.
*  Thank you very much for this honor that I have to be invited here at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
*  He's been promoting girls' education.
*  He was on stage with Bill Gates in New York last winter, promoting the idea of reducing
*  Niger's incredibly high birth rate.
*  And to have the opportunity to talk about problems that are crucial for a country like
*  Niger.
*  Because that's seen as a real drag on the country's ability to get itself out of poverty.
*  President Bazoum, Niger has proven itself to be a willing and able partner in the fight
*  against the violent extremist organizations.
*  Most importantly, for the US and European countries, he's allowed them to put some pretty big
*  military bases in Niger, which have really become the linchpin of this fight against
*  Islamic militancy, not just in Niger, but across the entire region.
*  And how big a problem is Islamic militancy in the Sahel?
*  And why is it so important to the US and to its allies in Europe?
*  Well, last year, about 6,700 people died across the world from extremist violence.
*  43% of those deaths occurred in the Sahel.
*  Wow.
*  Back in 2007, that was 1%.
*  That just gives you a sense about how this region has gone from zero to the top of the
*  global militancy charts, if you like.
*  And it's centered in some of the poorest countries in the world, including Niger.
*  And so as a result, just about every major terrorist franchise on earth has a presence
*  in the Sahel.
*  You've got Al-Qaeda, ISIS, you've got Boko Haram in Nigeria, you've got a plethora of
*  much smaller groups as well.
*  And they often kind of cross-pollinate with criminal activity in these areas, which makes
*  it just an incredibly hard problem to solve.
*  So the US has started to move into Niger.
*  It's set up a number of bases there, currently with about 1,100 troops in the country.
*  And as well as that, France, the former colonial ruler of Niger until 1960, also has a strong
*  presence in the country with about another 1,500 troops.
*  And there's also several large drone bases, some operated by the CIA, which are used to
*  carry out surveillance operations, not just in Niger, but in neighboring countries as
*  well.
*  So in what seems like a never-ending global fight against terrorism, the president of
*  Niger, who is very close with the US and its military, has become, it seems like our number
*  one ally in this region, which happens to be a hotbed of the very terrorism that the
*  US and its allies most fear.
*  Yeah, it's become the hotbed.
*  Part of this is because this is a very poor region.
*  But it's also because many of these states are very weak, and they have these exploding
*  populations of young people who've got very few opportunities in life, and that makes
*  them vulnerable to becoming radicalized.
*  But the thing about Niger is that its alliance with the West, certainly under Mr. Bazum,
*  seemed to be working recently because fatalities from violence fell in the first six months
*  of this year by 40%.
*  And that was like a huge contrast with the rest of the region where it was soaring.
*  So this partnership would seem to be working for both sides, for these Western governments
*  and for this current government of Niger.
*  So bring us to this coup that clearly endangers this partnership.
*  So one morning in late July, President Bazum is at the presidential residence in Niamey,
*  the capital, and he wakes up with his family only to discover that the presidential guard,
*  which is this elite military unit that's supposed to be keeping him safe, is now suddenly holding
*  him hostage inside his own house.
*  And he comes to realize that these soldiers have been given orders to place him under
*  detention and oust him from power.
*  And what do we understand to be the motives of these military figures who are staging
*  this coup?
*  Well, it's not immediately clear, but as time has gone on, we've sort of learned that this
*  was basically an internal battle inside the military.
*  Bazum's alliance with the West had certainly created some tensions between different military
*  units.
*  And as far as we can tell, the general who was in charge of the presidential guard was
*  worried that he was about to be fired and decided to move first against the president
*  before he could be removed.
*  And once they move against the president who is in his palace, what exactly happens?
*  Well, in the president's residence, it turns out there's a safe room, which since Bazum
*  came to power two years ago, he's had kind of upgraded.
*  So Bazum and his wife vanish into this safe room.
*  They close the door behind them.
*  And he immediately starts getting on the phone with some of his allies, Western leaders,
*  people like Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
*  He calls the leader of France, others, to tell them what's going on and effectively
*  to appeal for help to get him out.
*  At the same time, you've got protesters in favor of Bazum who start to gather in the
*  streets calling for his release.
*  Because he was elected by the people and it was a pure election.
*  And you've got a lot of confusion about who exactly is in charge of this coup or whether
*  indeed the entire military of Niger is united behind it.
*  Save Bazum!
*  Save Bazum!
*  And it's really not clear who's running the country.
*  Because normally in a coup, it happens quite fast.
*  The president's ousted, he is forced sometimes into a kind of humiliating resignation or
*  he has to go into exile.
*  And the military officers who've taken over stand up and say, now we're in charge.
*  But in this instance, the president is out of sight and apparently untouchable.
*  And he's reaching out to the outside world.
*  He's issuing tweets.
*  Some days later, he writes an op-ed in a Western newspaper.
*  He's calling some of the world's leaders, appealing for help.
*  And so he starts to build a head of steam behind this idea that this coup might be stillborn,
*  that there might be a way to reverse it.
*  And that's music to the ears of these very powerful Western allies in particular who
*  really do not want Mr. Bazum to be ousted from power because they see him as a crucial
*  element of their military operations in the region.
*  And so what do these international governments, these allies do once the president tells them,
*  look, I'm in the safe room, there is a coup underway, but I think it might be reversible?
*  So instead of what they usually do, which is kind of to shrug or to issue some condemnations,
*  but not much else, they start also to take stronger action than normal.
*  They immediately suspend most aid to Niger.
*  The French and other Europeans start to evacuate their citizens from the country, military
*  operations stop.
*  And it also turns out that it's kind of a red line for the region as well, because this
*  run of coups in the Sahel in recent years has really alarmed the leaders of some of
*  the biggest and wealthiest countries, especially Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa,
*  and a neighbor of Niger.
*  So they're worried that these coups could be contagious.
*  And they're also worried about this Islamist violence that it could spill over the borders
*  and hit them too.
*  So suddenly there's this intense diplomatic effort underway by everyone, the Americans,
*  the French, the Nigerians, to try and pull off this feat that normally is kind of impossible,
*  which is to pressure these coup leaders into turning around, go back to their barracks,
*  and reinstating President Bazum, who at this point is still locked up inside his own house.
*  And what kind of argument or what kind of incentives are being made to persuade these
*  coup leaders that that's actually in their interest?
*  It's basically pressure.
*  They're cutting aid.
*  They are having private conversations with the coup leaders, presumably wielding other
*  sort of threats as well.
*  But really the most striking statement comes from this regional group of countries led
*  by Nigeria.
*  They hold an emergency summit where they say, if the coup leaders don't step back within
*  a week, that they will consider military action against Niger.
*  This is almost unheard of in the region.
*  They're basically threatening war, some form of an invasion that would liberate Niger's
*  president.
*  Absolutely.
*  And then on the other side of the equation, you get to the neighboring countries, Mali
*  and Burkina Faso, which have also had coups in the last couple of years.
*  And they leap to the defense of the coup leaders, issuing their own statement where they say
*  they'll consider any move against this newly installed regime in Niger as a declaration
*  of war against their own countries, too.
*  So you see the battle lines suddenly being drawn in this region between this alliance
*  of coup countries, if you like, in the center of West Africa and these richer countries
*  around them who are threatening to attack to try and undo the coup.
*  So this is suddenly morphed into a very high stakes global standoff.
*  Absolutely.
*  You got to remember, nobody saw this coup coming in Niger.
*  It seemed to be a relatively stable country in this very turbulent region.
*  And suddenly, the clouds of war looming over it.
*  Major international powers are getting involved with threats and pressure.
*  And the entire region is on this very uncertain trajectory.
*  It's hard to believe how it's gotten so serious so fast.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Declan, it's now been three full weeks since this coup occurred.
*  This standoff between the leaders of the coup and the president of Niger persists.
*  What happens if this coup is never reversed in the end?
*  Well, Michael, experts will tell you that every day that passes from the start of a
*  coup almost exponentially diminishes the likelihood that that coup can ever be reversed.
*  And it looks like that's the direction we're going in in Niger.
*  And those threats that the regional countries made of launching a military operation have
*  not come to pass.
*  They now say that they're going to prioritize negotiations while maintaining that military
*  option.
*  And at the same time, the coup leaders themselves have really dug their heels in.
*  They've rallied tens of thousands of supporters in a sports stadium in the capital, Niameh.
*  Shouting slogans against the neighboring countries, against France.
*  So they've made it clear that they're going nowhere.
*  And they've been very belligerent in saying that if there is any whiff of a military action
*  against Niger, that they're going to resist that forcefully.
*  And so I think it now makes sense to start thinking about who's going to benefit from
*  this situation.
*  And who, based on your reporting, is likely to benefit from a situation where this coup
*  stays in place?
*  Well, first, it's the Islamic militants.
*  When the coups took place in neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso, attacks on civilians in
*  those countries actually soared.
*  In Mali, they doubled last year to about 5,000.
*  In Burkina, they went up by 80%.
*  But in Niger, in the last six months, the death toll has in fact been falling.
*  And that's a trend that many now fear could be reversed.
*  And why would that be though, Douglas, since in many of these countries, the military stages
*  the coup.
*  The military is awfully good at fighting terrorism, and it would seem have an interest in fighting
*  Islamic militancy.
*  So why does militancy grow when there's a coup?
*  That's right.
*  Many of these coup leaders take over, they cite the failure to push back the militants
*  as the reason that they're taking over.
*  And yet they seem to be doing a worse job than anyone else.
*  I mean, part of the reason has probably got to be that they're kind of on their own.
*  They've got less outside help.
*  They certainly don't have the help of these Western countries, or they bring in Russian
*  mercenaries, as in the case of Mali, to help with the fight.
*  But the evidence from Mali has shown that that has actually been counterproductive.
*  So that makes me think that we should assume that if the coup stays in place in Niger,
*  that isolation and lack of help will be present there as well.
*  And the US, for example, will probably pull out and therefore be less likely to help fight
*  terrorism.
*  Absolutely.
*  If this coup stays in place, the US and France have indicated that they're probably going
*  to have to pull out their troops and their drones.
*  And frankly, it's not clear where else in the region they'd be able to go.
*  But it is also possible that the US could work with these coup leaders to try and find
*  a way to stay.
*  But if they don't, clearly the biggest price might be paid by people in Niger, because
*  it's become clear that it's much harder to fight these militants if you don't have the
*  backup of sophisticated drones and Western technology.
*  And we've seen that quite vividly in Mali and Burkina Faso.
*  If the US does ultimately pull out, it would seem that that might create a benefit for
*  another set of parties, our rivals.
*  I'm thinking about China, for example, because we have been in competition for years with
*  China when it comes to trying to have influence in Africa.
*  The Daily did an episode a couple of months back about this very conflict.
*  And what's become clear is that China has really superseded the US in developing strong
*  relationships with countries throughout Africa, building bridges and government buildings
*  and ingratiating itself with leaders across the African continent.
*  This situation can't possibly help the US in that competition with China.
*  Yes, it would be bad.
*  But not just against China.
*  This coup also benefits another US rival, particularly in this part of the world, Russia.
*  And how does it benefit Russia?
*  Because like the Chinese, the Russians have been trying to expand their influence in Africa
*  across the continent in the last number of years, but in a very different way.
*  While China has been coming in with infrastructure and trying to exploit precious minerals in
*  Africa, the Russians have come in with the Wagner Group.
*  And when the Wagner Group turns up in an African country, you generally know things are not
*  going well.
*  As you recall, it's this infamous mercenary group basically operates under Russian military
*  intelligence.
*  And it's come into a series of countries, including some right beside Niger, you've
*  got Mali, you've got nearby Central African Republic and Sudan.
*  And the Russians offer mercenary services in return for usually access to gold and diamonds
*  and things like that.
*  There was this really interesting moment just after the coup in Niger, when you had supporters
*  of the coup on the streets waving Russian flags in downtown Niamey, some of them chanting
*  slogans in favor of President Putin, stoking these suspicions that the Kremlin in fact had
*  a hand in the coup.
*  Now, I think there's no evidence that that is true.
*  But it is a sign of how Russia has really successfully positioned itself in Africa as
*  a kind of torch of anti-establishment, sometimes even anti-Western feeling in some of these
*  really poor and troubled countries.
*  And of course, if Russia gains a good deal of influence in Niger, we can probably safely
*  assume that it will do things that are very much not in the interest of the United States.
*  That has been the history of Vladimir Putin all across the world.
*  Where possible, he will seek to make things harder for the US.
*  I mean, it would almost certainly cause the US to pull out of Niger.
*  And then secondly, like you said, it seems like the Russian policy often seems to revel
*  in this idea that it can cause disruption, reduce Western influence in these countries,
*  but not necessarily bring something better.
*  And that's what we've seen in those other countries in the region.
*  I mean, listening to you tick through who benefits from this coup lasting, it becomes
*  very clear just how much downside there is for the United States, if that happens.
*  And that makes me wonder whether the United States could have done anything better to
*  have prevented this coup.
*  And when the US government has, you know, a thousand plus troops in a country, I assume,
*  I think we all assume that it is very wired in and very invested in the health of the
*  government that hosts our troops.
*  It wants that place to be stable.
*  That doesn't seem to have happened here.
*  Yeah, I think you're right.
*  There's been already huge amounts of second guessing going on about how the US has handled
*  this coup, but also about US policy more broadly towards Niger.
*  I talked to this one analyst who told me that it reflects this idea that the American model
*  of being super focused on defense and security, on terrorism, on bringing these kind of big
*  ticket military items like drones to a country like Niger and special forces, but at the
*  same time neglecting to make the kind of long term investments in these countries in improving
*  governance and really taking a stand, for instance, on things like corruption that might
*  make for a more solid partner government and actually protect against the kind of coup
*  that we've seen happen recently and that has the potential to sort of sweep away all those
*  gains in one fell swoop.
*  As one person said to me, it's really striking that despite all of the money and security
*  assistance and aid that Western countries have poured into Niger in recent years, it
*  just took a handful of soldiers with guns, probably 12 hours to overthrow the country's
*  president and declare that they were in charge.
*  And I think that that tells you that you've got to step back and look at what's going
*  wrong, not just in the coup in Niger, but about policy more generally towards these countries.
*  Right.
*  And there's a very cruel irony in this, which is that by being so focused on terrorism and
*  militancy in a place like Niger, rather than perhaps on its long term stability, the U.S.
*  has perhaps unintentionally allowed something to happen that may make terrorism and militancy
*  that much worse.
*  That's right.
*  And this is an area of the world that desperately needs help.
*  The Sahel has some of the poorest countries in the world.
*  It has these exploding youthful populations.
*  And yet it's got these incredibly weak states that are unable to provide even the most basic
*  services for their people.
*  And the result of that is that you have this huge soaring populations of frustrated, jobless
*  young people, which really makes them very vulnerable to recruitment by these militant
*  groups.
*  The danger is that the spread of militancy is increasing the conditions for the coups
*  and the coups, unfortunately, are increasing the conditions for things to get worse.
*  And so we see the danger after this coup in Niger is that extremism is going to spread
*  and that the number of poor Nigerians affected by violence is going to grow.
*  Declan, I'm curious about the status at this point in the coup of Niger's president, this
*  staunch US ally.
*  Is he still stuck in the safe room inside of his palace?
*  Well, as best as we know, he's certainly still in his residence.
*  Now, whether he's still in the safe room is unclear.
*  But the coup leaders have certainly been doing their best to get him out.
*  They've turned off the power to his residence.
*  Apparently, his food supplies are running low.
*  He doesn't have access to a doctor.
*  We've had the US, the UN and others expressing fears about his safety and what's going to
*  happen next.
*  And then just this weekend, the coup leaders threatened to prosecute Mr.
*  Basoom for treason.
*  So, frankly, you know, things are not looking good for the deposed president or indeed for
*  the hopes of those countries who think there's still a chance this coup can be reversed.
*  The truth is that with every day that goes past, the coup leaders are getting stronger
*  and stronger and the chances of reversing the coup itself seem to be getting weaker
*  and weaker.
*  Odaqon, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  It was a pleasure, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Former President Trump has 10 days to turn himself in to prosecutors in Georgia to face
*  charges that he and 18 other people orchestrated a criminal enterprise to reverse the results
*  of the 2020 election in the state.
*  On Tuesday, in response to those charges, Trump claimed that he would soon release a
*  report showing, quote, irrefutable evidence that election fraud had occurred in Georgia.
*  That prompted Georgia's Governor Brian Kemp to declare that Trump was wrong in a statement.
*  Kemp said, quote, our elections in Georgia are secure, accessible and fair.
*  Today's episode was produced by Mary Wilson and Eric Krupke.

*  Our theme music is by Jim Rundberg and Van Lanenfork of Wonderland.
*  That's it for the Daily.
