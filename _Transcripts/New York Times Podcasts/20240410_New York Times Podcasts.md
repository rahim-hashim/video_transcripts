# Trumpâ€™s About-Face on Abortion
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC2xYACyRB0)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  By the time his first term was over, Donald Trump had cemented his place as the most anti-abortion
*  president in U.S. history.
*  Now, facing political blowback, he's trying to change that reputation.
*  Today, my colleague Lisa Lehrer on whether Trump's election year pivot can work.
*  It's Wednesday, April 10th.
*  Lisa, welcome back to the show.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  So Lisa, this week, Donald Trump weighed in on one of the most contentious American social
*  issues of our time, and one that has of course been right at the center of American politics,
*  and that is abortion.
*  This is a topic you know very deeply and very well.
*  So we wanted to have you on the show to talk about what Trump said and what it means for
*  the presidential campaign.
*  Well, this was a really anticipated statement.
*  Trump, in his classic Trumpian way, had been sort of teasing it that he was going to come
*  out with where he stood on abortion.
*  And so he comes out with this statement bright and early Monday morning, and he had three
*  main points that he really ran through in his remarks, which were posted on his social
*  media network, True Social.
*  Under my leadership, the Republican Party will always support the creation of strong,
*  thriving and healthy American families.
*  He starts out by talking about the Republican Party being the party of families.
*  And this was really a way to talk about IVF, which of course are the fertility treatments.
*  And that became a major topic of the national conversation after Alabama had a court ruling
*  that would have really limited access to those treatments.
*  I strongly support the availability of IVF for couples who are trying to have a precious
*  baby. What could be more beautiful or better than that?
*  There's very few things that the country is unified around right now.
*  And support for IVF is one of them.
*  So Trump comes out and says that he, too, supports those treatments.
*  He believes access to them should be kept open and free.
*  So that was his first point.
*  Then many people have asked me what my position is on abortion and abortion rights.
*  He moves into the abortion part of his remarks.
*  Especially since I was proudly the person responsible for the ending of something that...
*  And the first thing he does is take credit for ending Roe v.
*  Wade, which is, of course, the decision that created a constitutional right to abortion.
*  I want to thank the six justices, Chief Justice John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito,
*  Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett, and Neil Gorsuch.
*  Incredible people.
*  And then he moves to what he sees as his future thoughts, where the country should go in
*  this new post-Roe era.
*  This 50 year battle over Roe v.
*  Wade took it out of the federal hands and brought it into the hearts, minds and vote of
*  the people in each state was really something.
*  And what he basically says is that it should be left to the states.
*  Now it's up to the states to do the right thing.
*  Like Ronald Reagan, I am strongly in favor of exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.
*  You must follow your heart of this issue.
*  He expresses support that bans should include exemptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.
*  If a woman falls into any of those three categories, she should be allowed to get an abortion.
*  At the end of the day, it's all about will of the people.
*  That's where we are right now.
*  And that's what we want, the will of the people.
*  But the most striking thing about this four minute video was perhaps the issue that he
*  didn't mention at all, the issue he left out, which is this question of a 15 week federal
*  ban. Practically since the fall of Roe, since the Dobbs case overturned that right, the
*  anti-abortion movement has been pushing to get Republicans to line up behind this idea
*  of a 15 week federal ban, effectively a restriction that would cover the entire country.
*  So in the 30 or so states that allow abortion past that point in pregnancy, they would
*  no longer be allowed to do that.
*  All abortion across the country would be criminalized after 15 weeks.
*  So a huge change for blue states all over the place.
*  A huge change for blue states, some swing states, even some more conservative states
*  that haven't passed these more restrictive total bans.
*  Trump has been wishy washy on the issue for two years or so.
*  He's sort of dangled that maybe he would get behind this push and support a 15 week
*  federal ban, but he never quite committed to it.
*  And what we see in this video is that he's still not committing to it.
*  He doesn't say if such legislation came to his desk, he doesn't say whether he would
*  sign it. But what the anti-abortion movement hears in this is that he will not be
*  advocating for this policy.
*  So he's in essence pulling away from what the mainstream of the anti-abortion movement
*  wants, right? This federal ban.
*  But how should we understand what he's doing here?
*  Like, what's he up to?
*  Well, what he's trying to do is win the election.
*  That's what he's trying to do here.
*  I mean, abortion is a hugely important issue this race.
*  Democrats hope it will be the issue that could define and decide this election.
*  Since the right to an abortion was overturned, it transformed American politics in some
*  ways. It created this coalition of pro-abortion rights voters who have turned out
*  for Democrats again and again.
*  They've turned out in the midterms.
*  They've turned out in small sort of state legislative elections.
*  They've turned out in gubernatorial races in 2023.
*  And Trump knows that.
*  And so what we're seeing him do is to try to find a path through this issue that he
*  believes has been damaging to Republicans.
*  And what he's attempting to do with this statement is sort of defang some of the
*  Democratic power, some of this energizing force that abortion rights has become for
*  Democrats in American politics.
*  But that's a pretty sharp pivot, right?
*  I mean, this is the president who takes credit for overturning Roe, after all.
*  And now he's trying to tack back to the middle.
*  It is a pivot, but it's not all that surprising of one.
*  This is a politician who, unlike probably anyone else in American public life, has taken
*  just about every position on abortion someone could have throughout his career.
*  Would President Trump ban partial birth abortion?
*  Well, look, I'm very pro-choice.
*  I hate the concept of abortion.
*  When he first started flirting with a presidential run back in the late 90s, he went on TV and
*  said he was very pro-choice.
*  But you would not ban it?
*  No.
*  Or ban partial birth abortion?
*  No, I would.
*  I would.
*  I am pro-choice in every respect and as far as it goes, but I just hate it.
*  Just very briefly, I'm pro-life.
*  A decade or so later, he became pro-life before an audience of conservatives.
*  I've evolved on many issues over the years.
*  And you know who else has is Ronald Reagan evolved on many issues.
*  And I am pro-life.
*  And if you look at...
*  And then in 2016, when he ran, he was never the candidate of the anti-abortion crowd.
*  They didn't trust him.
*  They knew how he had moved on their issue.
*  Many of them voted for other candidates, but he won over the rank and file conservative
*  Christian voters.
*  And they extracted during that campaign a series of promises from him.
*  I am pro-life and I will be appointing pro-life judges.
*  Most significantly was that he would appoint what he called pro-life judges.
*  Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Webb?
*  If we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that's really what's going to be...
*  That will happen.
*  And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on
*  the court.
*  And he got elected and he changed the composition of the court to a more socially conservative
*  bent for a generation.
*  He worked to defund Planned Parenthood.
*  And by the time he ran again in 2020, the anti-abortion movement was calling him the
*  most pro-life president in history.
*  And he didn't win, but he turned out millions of Christian conservative voters behind him.
*  Right.
*  And so Trump leaves office in 2021.
*  And then a year later, all of those appointments he made to the court give the anti-abortion
*  movement really its biggest win in generations.
*  The overturning of Roe v.
*  His promise to appoint those pro-life judges, as he put it, bears fruit in a massive way, in
*  a way that outpaced even what the anti-abortion movement had hoped for when they first extracted
*  those promises for Trump back in 2016.
*  But what they didn't see coming on either side of the abortion debate was how quickly
*  the politics would transform.
*  That's when we saw this historically energizing issue for Republicans become really a much
*  more motivating issue for Democrats in independence.
*  I think the Republicans speak very inarticulately about this subject.
*  And when Trump saw those politics change, he began criticizing the anti-abortion
*  movement and their leaders.
*  I watched some of them without the exceptions, et cetera, et cetera.
*  I said, other than certain parts of the country, you can't, you're not going to
*  win on this issue.
*  As pushing for restrictions that were really just he felt a little bit too harsh.
*  He blamed them for Republican defeats in the 2022 midterms.
*  And so he expressed some views that this was an issue, abortion, that even though he was
*  happy to take credit for putting those justices in who overturned Roe, that the politics of
*  this issue, how it all shook out in the post-Roe world, was hurting Republicans and was
*  a political loser.
*  So in other words, throughout his career, he's followed the political winds on abortion.
*  Exactly. For the anti-abortion movement, this is a spiritual quest.
*  The effort to end abortion is an effort to right what they see as a moral wrong in
*  American life. For Trump, like so many things, this is politics.
*  This is transactional.
*  He'll give the anti-abortion movement this and they'll give him his votes.
*  It's not about morality.
*  It's about politics.
*  It's not about morality.
*  It's about politics.
*  It's about winning votes.
*  It's about courting interest groups and building his coalition.
*  And so that long history of back and forth, of transactional politics, of flip-flopping,
*  that all really leads us to this moment.
*  At the end of the video, he says,
*  Always go by your heart.
*  But we must win.
*  We have to win.
*  We have to win.
*  And that's basically Trump's views on abortion in a nutshell.
*  He's kind of saying the quiet part out loud, right?
*  Like, this isn't about abortion.
*  It's about winning votes.
*  And if this issue isn't going to win me votes, I'm ditching it.
*  That's exactly right.
*  And that, of course, leads to a more essential question, which is, will his
*  political gamble to chart this middle path?
*  Well, will it work?
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Lisa, Trump is making a bet, right?
*  That not going all in on the abortion issue is a smart move politically.
*  Help me understand how exactly he thinks this will help him win.
*  Well, we don't know exactly what he's thinking, but what he's clearly trying to
*  do is create a political position that allows moderates who may want to support
*  him, but also support abortion rights to cast their votes for him.
*  I spend a lot of time talking to voters about their views on abortion and their
*  views are complicated, often more complicated than you can get at in survey
*  questions. This is an issue that's really intimate.
*  It's really personal.
*  And so you have a lot of Republicans, mostly more moderate Republicans, who
*  support some form of abortion rights.
*  It's more than 40 percent by some surveys.
*  And so what Trump is trying to do here is make it OK for people with these
*  complicated views about abortion to vote for him, even if they do support
*  abortion rights.
*  He's saying, look, I'm not with the party that wants to do all this extreme stuff.
*  I actually have a more moderate view.
*  If you are kind of a moderate on the abortion issue, I'm your guy.
*  That's exactly right. And this is important because while these voters who are
*  Republican, but support some form of abortion rights across the country, they're
*  more concentrated in these really crucial, swingy battleground suburban districts,
*  places like suburban Phoenix or suburban Milwaukee, and support in those kinds of
*  places. One, Biden, the election in 2020.
*  That was a big reason why he was able to win the White House.
*  So what Trump is trying to do is ensure that he can, while maybe not totally win
*  those places, at least cut into Biden's strength in those areas and also allow
*  those voters to think about issues that he believes are more favorable for
*  Republicans. Immigration or inflation or crime.
*  Let them vote on those issues by neutralizing in his mind this question about
*  abortion rights. Right.
*  Got it. But where does that leave his base, though?
*  I mean, doesn't this position alienate them?
*  Well, so what Trump is calculating here is that his base is with him anyhow.
*  Conservative Christians are behind his bid just as they have been since 2016.
*  These are people who have stuck with him through all of it.
*  Not just the loss in 2020, but January 6th, the indictments, his current legal
*  peril. A lot of these conservative Christians are still with him and they're
*  going to vote for him regardless of what he says about abortion now.
*  Also, because they're still giving him credit for accomplishing this really big
*  thing that was in fact the thing, the overturning of Roe.
*  And you could really see that in the statements that anti-abortion leaders and
*  groups put out responding to this video.
*  People like Marjorie Dannesfelter, who leads a really big anti-abortion group.
*  You know, some of them took issue with what Trump said.
*  Some of them didn't like that he didn't support any kind of federal action,
*  particularly a federal ban.
*  But none of them said that they wouldn't be voting for him in November.
*  In fact, many of the leaders in the group said that they would continue to work
*  tirelessly to defeat Biden.
*  OK, so this is Trump's political gambit.
*  He's hoping that most of his base actually stays with him and he's trying to win
*  over some of the voters in the middle.
*  What do his colleagues within the Republican Party make of all of this?
*  Well, for people like Senator Lindsey Graham, like former Vice President Mike
*  Pence, people who really had opposition to abortion as a defining cause, a central
*  cause of their political career, they came out and said they didn't like this at
*  all. For them, the fall of constitutional abortion rights was only the beginning.
*  They want to eliminate abortion across the country.
*  So they need some kind of federal statute.
*  And so they came out and they offered some harsh criticism of Trump saying that he
*  had abandoned this foundational cause of the Republican Party.
*  And Trump, he hit right back.
*  He went on his social media network, Tru Social, and he attacked Marjorie
*  Danes-Felser and Senator Graham, saying that they should study states' rights in
*  the 10th Amendment. And after they did, they should get on with helping
*  Republicans win elections rather than, he said, making impossible for them to
*  do so.
*  I mean, he's doing a very Trumpy thing, right?
*  He has that kind of bull in a China shop upending these long-held Republican
*  positions. You know, for so long, Republicans opposed abortion no matter what.
*  Like, that was the default position.
*  But Trump is saying, hey, the politics have changed here, guys.
*  We have to change with them.
*  And for this handful of Republicans who opposed what he said, there were plenty of
*  Republicans, particularly candidates in swing states, that quickly aligned
*  themselves with Trump's new position on this.
*  Kerry Lake, the Republican Senate nominee in Arizona, and the Republican in Ohio in
*  the Ohio Senate race, candidates in Michigan, thought that Trump had offered
*  them a new template, a way to talk about this issue that may defang some of the
*  political attacks against them that are being launched by Democrats.
*  Interesting. So this is maybe showing a way kind of out of the woods for swing
*  state Republicans on a pretty difficult issue for Republicans.
*  Well, it's certainly giving them a glimmer of hope that they can find their
*  way out. Well, we don't know, of course, is if it's going to work.
*  And there's a lot of reasons why it may not.
*  You know, Trump is really trying to have it both ways.
*  He wants credit for being the president who appointed the justices, who overturned
*  row, but he also wants to wash his hands of the political ramifications of this
*  issue. And Democrats are just not going to let him do that.
*  His statement on Monday was met with a flood of Democratic response.
*  Biden put out a statement that campaign hammered him.
*  And perhaps the most impactful and really salient thing the Biden campaign did
*  is they released a new ad with a woman telling the story of how after she lost
*  her pregnancy. She was unable to get an abortion in Texas and developed a severe infection
*  that almost killed her twice and now may make it impossible for her to ever have another
*  child. And it's a really personal, heart-stirring ad that really gets at why this issue is just
*  so difficult for Republicans. The stories are so intimate, they're so real, and there's
*  just a steady drumbeat of them coming out of these conservative states. So as much as
*  Republicans want to talk about this in this sort of distance way of states' rights versus
*  federal rights, this is a situation that is really real for a lot of women in America
*  and forcing them to make really difficult medical and emotional choices.
*  So it continues to be a very live, very difficult issue for Trump. I mean, you know, saying
*  it should be back to the states, as you point out, doesn't mean that the issue goes away.
*  The states are still passing these very restrictive bans, which are, of course, made possible
*  by the overturning of Roe. And these bans are, at a national level, pretty unpopular.
*  Correct. And even if Republicans in Congress aren't taking steps on this, Republicans in
*  state houses are moving forward. We saw this in Florida, where the court upheld a 15-week
*  ban that will next month be a six-week ban on the procedure. That issue will then go
*  to voters in November in the form of a ballot measure. And even as we sit here right now,
*  recording this episode in the studio, we are waiting on a decision from the Arizona
*  Supreme Court, which is going to decide whether the state's current ban on nearly all abortions
*  after 15 weeks stays in place or becomes something even more restrictive. So this is just a very
*  live issue, and it's something that continues to dominate headlines and continues to be
*  top of mind for a lot of American voters and particularly American women.
*  Look, I think what Donald Trump really wanted to do with this video was take abortion off
*  the table, sort of neutralize it for the election. But whatever Trump wants, this issue is not
*  going anywhere. It's something that's going to continue to dominate through this presidential
*  race and potentially beyond.
*  Lisa, thank you.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  On Tuesday afternoon, Arizona's Supreme Court ruled that an abortion ban originally
*  enacted in 1864, but dormant for decades under Roe v. Wade, is now enforceable. The near
*  total ban in the critical swing state makes no exceptions for rape or incest. President
*  Biden immediately seized on it, calling it cruel and saying that it was the result of,
*  quote, the extreme agenda of Republican elected officials.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. On Tuesday, Jennifer and James Crumbly, whose
*  teenage son perpetrated the deadliest school shooting in Michigan's history, were sentenced
*  to 10 to 15 years in prison. They had been convicted of involuntary manslaughter for
*  failing to prevent their son, Ethan, from killing four of his classmates. The historic
*  sentencing makes the Crumblies the first parents in the country to be convicted for the deaths
*  caused by their child in a mass shooting. Prosecutors argued that the Crumblies ignored
*  warning signs and accused Mr. Crumbly of failing to secure the gun his son used in the shooting.
*  Their son pled guilty to 24 charges, including first degree murder, and was sentenced last
*  year to life in prison without parole. He did not testify in either of his parents' trials.
*  Today's episode was produced by Rob Zipko, Luke Vanderplug, and Shannon Lynn, with help from Summer
*  Tomad. It was edited by Lexi Diao with help from Michael Benoit, contains original music by
*  Marian Lozano, Dan Powell, Diane Wong, and Pat McCusker, and was engineered by Chris Wood.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landsvark of Wonderly.
*  That's it for the Daily. I'm Sabrina Tavernisi. See you tomorrow.
