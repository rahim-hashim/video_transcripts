# The Year in TV & Movies
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw)
*  Hey, it's Michael. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=0.0s)]
*  As I mentioned yesterday, for our last few episodes of 2024, we're bringing you something [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=2.32s)]
*  really special. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=7.44s)]
*  Today and for the next three days, my colleague, Melissa Kirsch, is going to talk to Time's [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=9.16s)]
*  critics, reporters, and editors who have spent the last 12 months making sense of the year [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  in arts and culture. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=20.22s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=22.64s)]
*  You're really going to like it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  From the New York Times, this is The Daily. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=31.92s)]
*  I'm Melissa Kirsch, deputy editor of Culture and Lifestyle. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=34.6s)]
*  As we close out 2024, I'll be talking with my colleagues around the newsroom about what [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=40.84s)]
*  they watched and listened to and read this year, about the things they loved and the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  things they didn't love. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=50.16s)]
*  Today, chief television critic James Ponowazek is here to talk about why TV might feel a [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=52.52s)]
*  little blah right now. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=58.2s)]
*  And then our chief film critic Manola Dargis on her favorite movies of 2024 and why you [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=61.64s)]
*  shouldn't let the algorithm tell you what to watch. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=67.04s)]
*  It's Thursday, December 26th. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=70.88s)]
*  Jim Ponowazek, thanks so much for being here. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=77.68s)]
*  Oh, thanks for having me. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=80.16s)]
*  OK, so Jim, fill in the blank. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=81.92s)]
*  In the world of television, 2024 was the year of... [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=83.96s)]
*  Mid-TV. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  Mid-TV. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=89.72s)]
*  Yeah. It's not great. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=90.96s)]
*  It's not terrible. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=92.92s)]
*  It's just mid. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=94.36s)]
*  Explain what you mean by that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  Mid-TV is OK TV of the present that kind of reminds you of great TV of the past. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=98.56s)]
*  It's, you know, got a famous cast. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  It was shot in fancy locations. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=112.08s)]
*  It's sleekly produced. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=115.6s)]
*  It's tasteful, but it's just not especially memorable. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't have the quirks and bumps and idiosyncrasies that mark a show that you're [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=122.6s)]
*  going to remember and will stick with you for a long time. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=130.44s)]
*  So give me an example of what you mean. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=134.04s)]
*  Palme Royale on Apple TV. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=137.28s)]
*  There are no doors on the back of the Palme Royale. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=139.44s)]
*  I never said I use the door. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=143.88000000000002s)]
*  I barely remember this show. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=145.8s)]
*  Exactly. Who Among Us does? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=147.8s)]
*  The cast was absolutely loaded. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=150.28s)]
*  Kristen Wiig, Laura Dern, Carol Burnett. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=153.12s)]
*  It looked fabulous. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=156.96s)]
*  And if you watched the whole thing, you probably forgot that you'd seen it a week later. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  I am never in over my head. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=163.96s)]
*  It would be disrespectful to my hairdresser. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=165.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=168.64s)]
*  But it wasn't that long ago that everybody was talking about prestige TV, right? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=169.2s)]
*  Like these highly polished hour long dramas that were as good as movies. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=174.24s)]
*  Walk me through how we got from prestige TV to mid TV. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=180.36s)]
*  So I think of the prestige television era as the era beginning around the turn of the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=185.8s)]
*  21st century when you had the emergence of a lot of new cable outlets, ones like HBO, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=192.92s)]
*  that in order to distinguish themselves in the marketplace, started taking big bets on [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  unusual shows that they had freedom to produce that traditional broadcast TV didn't. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=210.48s)]
*  And a classic example of this is The Sopranos. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  Whatever happened to Gary Cooper, the strong silent type? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=221.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=226.28s)]
*  On NBC, ABC, you couldn't do a show about a kind of sympathetic mobster. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  On HBO, you can. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  And then it's dysfunctionist and dysfunctional and dysfunctional fungo. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=235.32s)]
*  We get The Wire. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=239.56s)]
*  We get Breaking Bad. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  I am the one who knocks. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=242.52s)]
*  People like Martin Scorsese start making TV series. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=244.4s)]
*  Actors like Glenn Close start starring in cable TV series. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=248.16s)]
*  Hey, big man, you want to get into it? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  TV was, you could argue, the premier popular art medium of its time. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=257.12s)]
*  And also, it's now big business. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=265.96s)]
*  Netflix, which used to be the company that you got DVDs from in the mail, starts making [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=275.32s)]
*  original TV programming. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=281.32s)]
*  You look great. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=283.0s)]
*  I mean, who knew you could rock orange? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  And then it ultimately is joined by Amazon. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=285.92s)]
*  We don't need cops like you anymore, Bush. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  By Apple. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  Hey, how y'all doing? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=291.6s)]
*  I'm Ted Laszlo. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  Disney. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=293.36s)]
*  Guilty of being the god of mystery. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  Paramount. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=295.52s)]
*  Your honor, the issue here is not intellectual property. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=296.08s)]
*  And on and on and on. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=297.76s)]
*  And that creates this money gusher directed at starting up a lot of new shows in order [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=300.56s)]
*  to create enough content for these platforms to produce a lot of prestige looking thumbnails [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=310.64s)]
*  when you get to the home screen of the app. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=319.6s)]
*  And what is serving up those thumbnails to you? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=322.92s)]
*  It's the algorithm. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=325.88s)]
*  It's deciding what you are likely to click on and keep watching to generate those viewing [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  hours for them. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=333.52s)]
*  And that creates a different kind of incentive. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=334.96s)]
*  That's not the kind of incentive where you're like, oh, I'm going to create a drama about [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=337.88s)]
*  a mobster in New Jersey because people haven't seen that before. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=343.92s)]
*  And it'll be so surprising. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=347.68s)]
*  They'll watch it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=349.12s)]
*  It is I'm going to generate something that kind of reminds you of that show that you [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=350.44s)]
*  watched about the mobster in New Jersey so that you'll click on that and watch our [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=354.84s)]
*  streaming platform for a little longer. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=360.96s)]
*  Metals or wounds. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=362.96s)]
*  Each man in the hundred and first airborne would be going home. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=364.2s)]
*  You loved Band of Brothers back when it was on HBO. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=367.91999999999996s)]
*  All right. Apple TV is going to give you Masters of the Air, which is more boring, but [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=371.2s)]
*  it's good enough for now. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=376.55999999999995s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=378.12s)]
*  The hundredth bomb group was sent to England in the spring of 19. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=378.76s)]
*  You liked Big Little Lies on HBO. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=382.44s)]
*  I feel so ashamed for saying this, but being a mother, it's not enough for me. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=384.56s)]
*  OK, we'll make Apples Never Fall, another Leanne Moriarty novel, not as distinctive or [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=388.72s)]
*  original or surprising, but probably good enough for now. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=396.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=400.6s)]
*  You just give it all up because that's what having a family demands of a woman. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=401.6s)]
*  It's this tsunami of familiar, safe content that results in just a deluge of mid TV. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=405.64s)]
*  So you hear so much about how people's attention spans are limited these days and there's [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=418.56s)]
*  so much vying for their attention with social media and TikTok and Instagram. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=422.96s)]
*  If TV is mid, how can TV hope to retain its audience? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=427.2s)]
*  Well, I think it's definitely a danger for the TV industry. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=431.92s)]
*  You know, I think if you have a lot of same seeming stuff out there, you run the risk [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=434.6s)]
*  of just over saturation of the market, which in fact is what we seem to be experiencing [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=443.08s)]
*  now. I mean, I don't think that the artists of television have gotten less creative. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=449.76s)]
*  I think that it is more difficult in this environment to pitch off the wall, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=455.96s)]
*  idiosyncratic and personal ideas. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=463.16s)]
*  You know, something like Fleabag, which was an amazing show that really represents a risk [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=469.04s)]
*  for a programmer that is responsible for answering to boards and all the people who've [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=476.92s)]
*  put up all this money. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=484.0s)]
*  I met someone. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=485.16s)]
*  What? Really? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=486.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=487.6s)]
*  Oh my God, that's amazing. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=488.48s)]
*  What does he do? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=490.76000000000005s)]
*  He's a priest. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=492.36s)]
*  I mean, as a viewer, I want off the wall and idiosyncratic and personal, you know, and [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=496.8s)]
*  what you're describing, you know, I'm familiar with this kind of zombie version of [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=502.88s)]
*  prestige TV and it's not satisfying. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=506.72s)]
*  It's not, you know, the show that I want to binge. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=509.20000000000005s)]
*  I'm just I'm wondering what the outlook is. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=513.0400000000001s)]
*  Is mid TV the future of TV? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=516.08s)]
*  Is this just the way TV is now? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=519.4s)]
*  You know, talent always finds a way out. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=522.24s)]
*  There are times in the history of any medium when it gets a little more difficult for [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=525.24s)]
*  talent and originality to find its way. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=531.36s)]
*  But artists want to create even when all the forces of money and business and the [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=534.0s)]
*  culture and technology are pushing against that and trying to smooth out the bumps. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=542.6s)]
*  And that's what gives me hope. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=548.96s)]
*  OK, so reasons for optimism. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=551.6800000000001s)]
*  So tell me about the shows that really stood out for you this year. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=554.16s)]
*  One show this year that I absolutely loved and can recommend unreservedly was We Are [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  Lady Parts. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=563.96s)]
*  It is this fresh, irreverent, screamingly funny British sitcom about a band of female [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=568.96s)]
*  Muslim punk musicians. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=580.8s)]
*  So maybe instead of Voldemort under my head scarf, you could do I love to wear my head [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=582.3599999999999s)]
*  scarf, you know, less more. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=590.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't know. Yeah. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=593.0s)]
*  Part of what works so well about We Are Lady Parts is that it is very much a story that [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=594.24s)]
*  is about trying to make original outspoken art under the constraints of working for a [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=599.88s)]
*  big entertainment corporation. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=606.8s)]
*  Another show that I really liked and is so original that I almost have a hard time [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=610.8s)]
*  characterizing it was Fantasmas, which was a comedy on HBO this year starring the comic [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=623.68s)]
*  funny person Julio Torres. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=635.52s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=638.24s)]
*  But the reason I'm here is because I was tossing and turning all night thinking about how [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=639.1999999999999s)]
*  you need to make a clear crayon. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=642.8s)]
*  Clear. Like the color clear. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=645.28s)]
*  Yes. I think a term I used for it was sketch fantasy about a young man trying to rent an [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=646.5999999999999s)]
*  apartment in New York. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=656.4399999999999s)]
*  It's kind of this this surreal stream of consciousness look into his imagination and [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=658.0s)]
*  the workings of his mind. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=665.56s)]
*  Julio, you need a new apartment and to get a new apartment, you need proof of existence. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=667.6800000000001s)]
*  No, I can't think of the apartment because I'm I'm I'm sick. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=672.4s)]
*  No, Julio, don't go into your thoughts. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=677.44s)]
*  Come back. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=680.32s)]
*  It's the opposite of mid TV. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=681.32s)]
*  It's not trying to be familiar or safe or, you know, kind of a turn your brain off [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=683.64s)]
*  experience. It's a surprising, fun show that makes you pay attention because it's so [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=690.12s)]
*  original. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=695.96s)]
*  I don't go here. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=697.76s)]
*  And why are you here? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=699.6s)]
*  Because I'm waiting for class to be over so I can yell at a hamster. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=701.6800000000001s)]
*  Oh, I'm going to check this out. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=706.48s)]
*  That's one thing I love about television is that it's a medium that ideally is very [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=709.0400000000001s)]
*  responsive to changes in the culture and shifts in the currents. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=712.9200000000001s)]
*  And it's a way for different voices that you may not have encountered before to to [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=718.48s)]
*  percolate through and kind of shift your perspective. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=723.88s)]
*  So talent will out. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=729.56s)]
*  Talent will out. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=731.72s)]
*  It may take a little longer sometimes than the others, but talent will out. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=732.96s)]
*  Well, I am feeling a little more hopeful than I was at the outset of this conversation. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=738.48s)]
*  So thank you so much for talking with me, Jim. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=742.76s)]
*  Thank you so much for talking with me. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=745.28s)]
*  After the break, I'll talk with chief film critic Manola Dargis about the best movies [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=746.64s)]
*  of 2024. We'll be right back. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=751.64s)]
*  Manola Dargis, thank you for being here. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=763.36s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=765.88s)]
*  So I'm wondering if you could do something for me, which is I'd like you to read the [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=767.08s)]
*  list of the top grossing movies of 2024. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=770.88s)]
*  Sure. Easy enough to do. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=774.08s)]
*  Inside Out 2, which is a charming sequel from Pixar. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=776.96s)]
*  Deadpool and Wolverine, which I could not stand. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=781.64s)]
*  Despicable Me 4, which I will never see unless I'm forced by gunpoint. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=785.0s)]
*  Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, which was fine, fine. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=789.2800000000001s)]
*  Dune Part 2, Wicked Twisters, Moana 2, Godzilla, Kong, The New Empire, Kung Fist, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=792.88s)]
*  Kung, The New Empire, Kung Fu Panda 4. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=801.2800000000001s)]
*  OK. Now, of the movies you just mentioned, nine out of 10 of them are sequels and Wicked [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=806.0400000000001s)]
*  is technically a prequel to The Wizard of Oz. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=811.5200000000001s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=814.32s)]
*  Well, it's very familiar. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=815.96s)]
*  Sequelitis. This is the current model for the, you know, the big companies. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=818.36s)]
*  So very similar to what's going on with TV, where studios aren't looking for necessarily [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=824.48s)]
*  innovative or original work. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=829.48s)]
*  They're looking for safe bets. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=831.7600000000001s)]
*  If you're in charge of a multimillion dollar, you know, outfit, much less a [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=833.6400000000001s)]
*  multibillion dollar conglomerate, you're not really going to be one to take big [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=838.0s)]
*  chances like, oh, let's bankroll this tiny little movie from now. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=841.96s)]
*  And that whole mentality is really that's been part of the mainstream entertainment [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=845.5600000000001s)]
*  business for some time. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=851.6800000000001s)]
*  And when you start introducing things like algorithms at a certain point, it's just [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=853.24s)]
*  going to start suggesting things that you've already, you know, that are like what you [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=857.28s)]
*  just saw. It's kind of depressing. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=860.8399999999999s)]
*  And we should say that not all sequels are bad. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=864.4s)]
*  You liked some sequels. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=866.36s)]
*  Oh, I like the Gladiator sequel very much. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=867.4s)]
*  I never forgot it. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=871.48s)]
*  The slave could take revenge against an emperor. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=873.76s)]
*  First of all, Sharks versus Gladiators. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=877.28s)]
*  What's not to like? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=880.92s)]
*  And also, it's a fan. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=882.36s)]
*  There's a fantastic performance from Denzel Washington. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=883.4s)]
*  It's one of the great performances of the year. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=886.0s)]
*  I have a destiny. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=888.6s)]
*  The gods delivered you to me. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=893.48s)]
*  You will be my instrument. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=898.64s)]
*  He's wildly entertaining. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=900.2s)]
*  So don't please people do not tell me there's nothing to see. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=902.0s)]
*  There are things to see. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=905.28s)]
*  OK, so let's talk about some of those things to see. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=907.2s)]
*  I've got your list of the best films of the year here. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=909.88s)]
*  Your number one movie of 2024 is an Indian film called All We Imagine as Light. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=912.72s)]
*  I have not seen this movie. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=918.8000000000001s)]
*  I would say that most people have not seen this movie. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=921.08s)]
*  It's quite a small movie. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=923.5600000000001s)]
*  It is made by Payal Kapadia. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=925.44s)]
*  And it is a deeply touching movie that even when I start talking about it, I get a [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=928.6800000000001s)]
*  little misty. So forgive me. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=934.48s)]
*  It's set in Mumbai and it focuses on one woman, but mainly three women who all work [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=936.44s)]
*  at a hospital, two nurses and a cook. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=943.5200000000001s)]
*  And it is about both their individual lives, but also their relationships with one another. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=945.48s)]
*  Kapadia has worked in documentary before, and she inserts these documentary scenes of [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=956.36s)]
*  people just milling about, celebrating, walking in streets. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=963.52s)]
*  And you get the sense from the movie that she could have picked another three people [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=968.68s)]
*  and told their stories. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=974.84s)]
*  And what she's saying is each of us has a story that is there. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=977.0799999999999s)]
*  It is something I have never seen and that I was delighted to see. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=985.36s)]
*  It's an independent film and it's glorious. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=990.9599999999999s)]
*  And now let's talk about a very different kind of movie. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1003.92s)]
*  Another film you love this year was Furiosa, a Mad Max saga. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1007.0799999999999s)]
*  This is the latest entry in the Mad Max franchise. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1011.28s)]
*  It's directed by George Miller and stars Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1014.68s)]
*  I'd bullet far with that I could have crippled the Citadel. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1020.16s)]
*  Rule the White's land. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1023.56s)]
*  The White's land would have been a far better place for all of us. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1024.84s)]
*  George Miller, great director from Australia. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1029.68s)]
*  He makes these incredibly, they're just pure cinema, I think. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1032.32s)]
*  And I love the stories. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1038.2s)]
*  This one did move me. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1040.08s)]
*  It's about a woman's empowerment, you know, and can I say I'm a sucker for female [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1041.24s)]
*  empowerment? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1045.32s)]
*  My childhood, my mother. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1046.3999999999999s)]
*  I want them back. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1050.2s)]
*  Of course you do. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1052.44s)]
*  I want them back. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1053.3200000000002s)]
*  One of the things I really love about it is George Miller uses practical effects [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1055.44s)]
*  rather than relying on just computer generated imagery. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1058.92s)]
*  And so you are really watching people doing these crazy things. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1061.88s)]
*  And it's beautifully choreographed the way, let's say, a 1930s or 40s Fred Astaire [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1066.4s)]
*  number would be beautifully choreographed. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1073.2s)]
*  We are talking about, you know, visual pleasure, you know, maximum. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1074.92s)]
*  It's just so wonderful. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1080.52s)]
*  I think a movie people might be surprised to find in your top 10 is Megalopolis. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1091.28s)]
*  This is the movie that Francis Ford Coppola, who directed The Godfather and Apocalypse [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1096.5600000000002s)]
*  now, self-financed and wrote and directed. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1100.6s)]
*  It stars Adam Driver. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1103.7199999999998s)]
*  It was divisive, but you loved it. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1105.32s)]
*  Listen, man, I'm going down on this ship. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1109.24s)]
*  I don't care. This is a wildly ambitious, ungainly, imperfect movie. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1111.1999999999998s)]
*  But you are going to see things much like with, you know, a George Miller movie that [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1119.8s)]
*  you have never seen before. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1124.32s)]
*  This is a movie that Coppola has been thinking about for decades. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1126.76s)]
*  He's been working on it and it's a very optimistic movie filled with beautiful imagery. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1131.36s)]
*  And it is kind of nuts in a bit in a glorious way. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1136.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean, why? You know, it's not Despicable Me 234. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1141.08s)]
*  You know, it's not it's something different. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1144.8799999999999s)]
*  It is funny. It is strange. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1146.8s)]
*  It is unexpected. And why? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1150.1599999999999s)]
*  You know, why do you go to the movies? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1152.76s)]
*  Do you just want to see the same thing over and over and over again? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1154.04s)]
*  No, maybe see something that you have never seen before. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1156.8799999999999s)]
*  And I guarantee you that you have never seen this before. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1159.44s)]
*  Oh, hear me time. For Julia. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1163.32s)]
*  Just try. Hear me time stop now. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1170.2s)]
*  Resist the algorithm. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1180.6s)]
*  Seek out movies that. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1182.16s)]
*  Resist the algorithm. This is going to be my new t-shirt. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1183.76s)]
*  All right, sister, I think we're ready for a revolution now, right? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1186.24s)]
*  We're going to go. To the barricades. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1188.92s)]
*  OK, let's take a little break. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1194.3600000000001s)]
*  And when we return, we're going to talk about movies you can see in the theater right now. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1196.0s)]
*  So here we are in the week between Christmas and New Year's. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1200.68s)]
*  A lot of people have time off from work. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1213.92s)]
*  This is a time when a lot of people go to the movies. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1215.6000000000001s)]
*  What do you recommend? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1218.16s)]
*  There are some really interesting movies that I highly recommend that people can look at. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1219.72s)]
*  One of those I really like, September five. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1224.3600000000001s)]
*  Do you hear that? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1230.68s)]
*  We're close gunshots. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1233.8s)]
*  It's about the 1972 Olympics, where the Israeli team was taken hostage [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1236.52s)]
*  and ABC was covering it live. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1244.48s)]
*  What do you watch other cameras? What do you mean? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1248.96s)]
*  I mean, can we show someone being shot on live television? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1250.76s)]
*  You know, it's a very modest movie. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1254.5600000000002s)]
*  It's really short, it's about 90 minutes long. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1255.72s)]
*  And it just seems like, oh, it's just about the fact that they were covering it. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1257.52s)]
*  No, I think it's about journalistic ethics. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1260.24s)]
*  And it's really interesting. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1261.92s)]
*  And I think it's very germane to the moment. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1262.96s)]
*  Our job is to tell the story of these individuals whose lives are at stake. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1265.64s)]
*  It's not OK for me, the worse. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1270.36s)]
*  I also like a movie coming up called The Brutalist, which is a movie by Brady Corbett. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1274.16s)]
*  And it stars Adrian Brody, who, when we first see him, is actually just stepping off onto Ellis Island. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1280.52s)]
*  It's post World War Two and he comes to America. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1286.8s)]
*  And he kind of runs face first into the wall of American capitalism. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1289.68s)]
*  Tell me why is an accomplished foreign architect shoveling coal here in Philadelphia? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1294.96s)]
*  It is a really big, ambitious movie. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1302.36s)]
*  And it has one of the other great performances of the year from Guy Pearce, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1305.4s)]
*  who plays an American capitalist. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1309.92s)]
*  Oh, my God, it is an amazing performance. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1312.48s)]
*  So highly recommend that movie. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1316.0s)]
*  It's a beautiful movie. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1317.64s)]
*  If you can see it in theaters, please do. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1319.0400000000002s)]
*  It is one of the most beautiful kind of monumental looking. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1321.8000000000002s)]
*  I mean, he just it's tremendous looking. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1325.44s)]
*  And then, of course, there's like the movie that I think is going to be a very, very big Oscar movie [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1331.0s)]
*  is a complete unknown, starring Timothy Chalamet as the very, very young and cutie pie Bob Dylan. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1337.4s)]
*  The movie opens with him arriving in New York City, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1348.6000000000001s)]
*  and it takes us through to when he first, you know, when he goes electric. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1351.8000000000002s)]
*  And it's a movie that I think is going to surprise people in terms of Timothy Chalamet. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1356.4s)]
*  It's a opening on a whole new Chalamet chapter. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1361.4s)]
*  And it's a movie that is going to be talked a lot about in terms of the Oscars. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1364.96s)]
*  So you're going to hear a great deal about that for the next couple of months. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1368.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, it sounds like there's a lot of good stuff to see in the theater right now. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1378.64s)]
*  Manola, thank you so much for being here. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNuvDHAPSw&t=1382.64s)]
