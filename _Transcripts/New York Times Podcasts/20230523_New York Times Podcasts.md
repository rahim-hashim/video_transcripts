# The Supreme Court vs. Andy Warhol
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbj1Dev_jYE)
*  Hey, it's Michael.
*  If you listen to podcasts, which we know you do because you're here, you know that the
*  biggest challenge is finding great stuff to listen to.
*  The Times wants to make that a lot easier.
*  We're launching an audio app, NYT Audio, a single place where you can find the shows
*  you already know and love, like The Daily, This American Life, Serial, The Run-Up, and

*  I want to introduce you to one of them.
*  It's called The Headlines, and it pairs perfectly with The Daily.
*  As you know, The Daily tells one big story a day.
*  But The Times is covering dozens of stories a day with reporters across the world.
*  And that's where The Headlines comes in.
*  It captures even more news than The Daily does in just 10 minutes.
*  And all this week, we're going to give you The Headlines right here on The Daily feed.
*  After that, you can listen to it, along with The Daily, on the audio app.
*  So how do you get this app?
*  If you're a Times, News, or All Access subscriber, you can get it for free by going to nytimes.com
*  slash audio app, or by searching NYT Audio in the app store.
*  If you're not a subscriber, the app is the perfect reason to become one.
*  And now, on to the show.
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  A few days ago, the Supreme Court tried to answer a question that has long bedeviled
*  the world of art.
*  When is borrowing from an earlier artist an act of inspiration?
*  And when is it theft?
*  Today, Adam Liptak on the case that could change how art is made.
*  This Tuesday, May 23rd.
*  Adam, if you'll just indulge me for a moment, how would you describe your relationship to
*  fine art?
*  I'm a dilettante.
*  My wife takes me to a lot of museums.
*  I try to be a cultured person.
*  That's noble.
*  And what are your specific thoughts about Andy Warhol?
*  You know, Warhol is so present in the popular culture, even though much of what he does
*  is appropriate and comment on the culture of celebrity.
*  Even though, if I'm reading between the lines, not everyone, including you, even agrees that
*  everything Warhol does is art.
*  And just to give you my perspective on this, my experience with it, Warhol, for me, is
*  a bath book that I read to my son, Ash.
*  If you get the pages wet, the pieces of art in the book, the Brillo pad boxes, the Campbell
*  soup cans, they turn a different shade of color.
*  I mean, this is how ubiquitous Andy Warhol has become.
*  He is in the bathtub.
*  Right.
*  And, you know, museums around the world display his work, and it's worth cumulatively hundreds
*  of millions, if not a billion dollars.
*  Right.
*  And the reason we're talking to you about Warhol is not because we're here to debate
*  the relative merits or valuations of his pieces, but because he is the subject of a pretty
*  important Supreme Court ruling, one that came down a few days ago and that I think got a
*  little bit lost in the shuffle of the news.
*  So tell us about that case.
*  So you know, Michael, we often talk about the blockbuster cases involving huge social
*  issues, abortion, affirmative action, gay rights, religion.
*  But the court also can issue quite important consequential decisions about all kinds of
*  areas of American life.
*  And this case that came down a couple of days ago involves a quite large question about
*  What artists can do and how much they can make use of, draw on, engage in a conversation
*  with earlier works or whether that crosses a line of copyright infringement.
*  In other words, the Supreme Court weighed in on when is art appropriation, when is it
*  honorary borrowing, when is it theft?
*  Right.
*  Or when is it such a transformation that it's created something wholly new or protectable
*  in its own right?
*  And where does this case, Adam, begin?
*  It starts in 1981 when the rock musician Prince is starting to get famous.
*  His album Controversy comes out.
*  He hosts Saturday Night Live.
*  And a prominent rock photographer, Lynn Goldsmith, thinks it's time to get some photographs of
*  him.
*  She gets a commission from Newsweek magazine.
*  She takes some concert photos and some portraits.
*  One portrait in particular, which will be at the center of this case, Black and White,
*  shows Prince kind of ill at ease, vulnerable.
*  It's a striking photograph of a young rock musician.
*  Couple years later, 1984, Prince is turning into a superstar.
*  His album Purple Rain is coming out.
*  And Vanity Fair wants to do an article on him and asks Andy Warhol, the very prominent
*  artist, to illustrate it.
*  They obtain for Warhol one of Lynn Goldsmith's portraits as an artist's reference.
*  They pay her 400 bucks and tell her they will use it once.
*  And Warhol gets to work and alters the photograph.
*  He kind of crops it.
*  He colors it purple.
*  He sort of shades Prince's eyes.
*  It's a very different looking kind of disembodied head that art critics say is not that kind
*  of lonely, ill at ease portrait of Prince, but is a kind of view of modern celebrity.
*  Or so the art critics say.
*  So Vanity Fair publishes that silkscreen image by Warhol based on the Goldsmith photo.
*  Warhol also goes off and creates 15 other variations on the Goldsmith photo.
*  And this is common with Warhol.
*  He will do various versions of photos of celebrities.
*  Right.
*  The Maryland's, et cetera.
*  Right.
*  And then when Warhol dies in 1987, those images and all of his other artwork and all of the
*  copyrights in them go to the Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts.
*  Then in 2016, Prince himself dies.
*  And Vanity Fair's parent company, Conde Nast, puts together a special magazine celebrating
*  Prince's life.
*  And it wants to find a cover image and it goes to the Andy Warhol Foundation and say,
*  what do you got?
*  And they take a different image from this series and put it on the cover and pay the
*  foundation $10,000.
*  And Lynn Goldsmith gets no money and no credit.
*  And when she becomes aware of this use of her work, she says, wait a second, that's
*  copyright infringement.
*  You're not allowed to do that.
*  And what does the Warhol Foundation have to say about that?
*  The Warhol Foundation launches a lawsuit.
*  Huh.
*  And what is their rationale for filing a lawsuit and making that argument?
*  Because they could just have paid her off, right?
*  You know, we're not privy to the settlement negotiations, but at the argument, the Warhol
*  Foundation's lawyers said that Goldsmith had asked for a quite substantial seven-figure
*  sum.
*  But the lawsuit also has a larger purpose.
*  And it's a purpose that the Warhol Foundation has to care deeply about because it goes to
*  the heart of Warhol's work.
*  And they want to make the case that under the copyright laws and under the so-called
*  fair use exception to copyright infringement, it's important to create some space for later
*  artists to make use of earlier works.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  So the Warhol Foundation is trying to make a point about the need to protect artistic
*  expression that builds on, appropriates, and transforms earlier works.
*  Right.
*  So for the Warhol Foundation, this is not about one payment, one lawsuit, one anything.
*  This is a more existential question of whether an artist like Warhol gets to practice their
*  craft, which involves borrowing and appropriating on a pretty large scale.
*  That's right.
*  And the court has looked at this question in a slightly different context before.
*  In 1994, in a case involving the rap group 2 Live Crew and Roy Orbison, one of the founding
*  fathers of rock and roll.
*  2 Live Crew wanted to have some fun with the Roy Orbison hit Pretty Woman.
*  And substitute other characters for Pretty Woman.
*  Big Hairy Woman.
*  You need to shave that stuff.
*  Big Hairy Woman.
*  Big Hairy Woman.
*  Right.
*  Two Time and Woman.
*  I know the song.
*  The owners of those rights of the Orbison song flatly said, no, we don't want to be
*  involved in a parody that transforms a pretty woman into a hairy woman.
*  No, thank you.
*  2 Live Crew does it anyway, takes its chances, has a big hit.
*  They get sued.
*  And the Supreme Court said, well, if it's parody, that's in the nature of fair use.
*  That comment, criticism, parody gets protected because otherwise you couldn't do it at all.
*  Got it.
*  So from where the Warhol Foundation sits, it looks like a very big and very important
*  precedent case that it can call upon in its dispute with Lynn Goldsmith would seem to
*  favor Warhol's approach to art, which is cumulative, it is borrowish, it is what 2
*  Live Crew did to Roy Orbison.
*  So that's mostly right.
*  Although there may be a key distinction.
*  Where 2 Live Crew is engaging with and commenting on the earlier work, it's not clear that Warhol
*  is saying anything about the Goldsmith photo.
*  He's using it, yes.
*  But is he actually engaging with it?
*  Is he actually saying something about it?
*  Or could he just have easily gone to any other photograph of prints to do his Warhol number
*  on that photograph?
*  So there's some real gray area in this Warhol lawsuit.
*  So tell us about the oral arguments in this case once it hits the nine justices of the
*  Supreme Court.
*  We will hear argument first this morning in case number 21-869, Andy Warhol Foundation
*  versus Goldsmith.
*  Mr. Martinez?
*  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court?
*  So the lawyer for the Warhol Foundation, Roman Martinez, makes two basic points, one focused
*  and one quite large.
*  Warhol's print series can reasonably be perceived to convey a fundamentally different meaning
*  or message from Goldsmith's photograph.
*  The focused argument is that he maintains that all you need to do is look at the Warhol
*  piece and you will see that it conveys a fundamentally different message, that its meaning is different
*  from the photograph and that it should be protected for that reason.
*  Finally, the stakes for artistic expression in this case are high.
*  His larger point is that it's not about one image of prints.
*  It's about the nature of how art works.
*  A ruling for Goldsmith would strip protection not just from this print series, but from
*  countless works of modern and contemporary art.
*  And that lots of visual and other kinds of art, music, literature, works because the
*  The later work is building on, commenting on, in dialogue with the earlier work.
*  It would make it illegal for artists, museums, galleries, and collectors to display, sell,
*  profit from, maybe even possess a significant quantity of works.
*  And for the Supreme Court to say that the copyright law is so rigid that it doesn't
*  for that kind of expression would do grave damage to the artistic community.
*  Not just damage to Warhol, but basically to any artist who does what Warhol does, of which
*  there are thousands.
*  Yes, certainly visual art, but also all kinds of art.
*  And what about the other side?
*  Adam, what do lawyers for Lynn Goldsmith tell the justices?
*  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.
*  Goldsmith's lawyer, Lisa Bland, says the question isn't whether Warhol was a genius or an artist.
*  The question was whether he or his foundation should have paid Goldsmith when he built on
*  her work, that there should be no kind of Warhol exception for this genius.
*  Petitioner responds Warhol is a creative genius who imbued other people's art with his own
*  distinctive style.
*  But Spielberg did the same for films and Jimi Hendrix for music.
*  Those giants still needed licenses.
*  She had this nice phrase, copyrights will be at the mercy of copycats if the court rules
*  for Warhol.
*  Anyone could turn Darth Vader into a hero or spin off all in the family into the Jeffersons
*  without paying the creators a dime.
*  I welcome your questions.
*  So both sides seem to be making the most extreme arguments they can think of.
*  And the justices as they weigh in on the case also seem to be staking out quite extreme positions.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Adam, during the oral arguments in this case, what do the justices have to say about
*  Warhol, Goldsmith and the merits of this case?
*  There are basically two schools of thought.
*  A couple of the justices, and they're not typically allies, really seem to be taken
*  by the quality of Warhol's art and suggest that at least when we're talking about Andy
*  Warhol, you really ought to let him have some room to maneuver.
*  Which justices?
*  Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Kagan.
*  Ms. Blatt, you said that the only thing that's different was the distinctive style of Warhol.
*  I think your friend's point is broader than that.
*  Roberts completely buys in to the idea that Warhol is sending a different message.
*  It's not just that Warhol has a different style.
*  It's that unlike Goldsmith's photograph, Warhol sends a message about the depersonalization
*  of modern culture and celebrity status.
*  So it's not just a different style.
*  It's a different purpose.
*  One is to commentary on modern society.
*  The other is to show what Prince looks like.
*  And Kagan, in slightly more colloquial terms, asked the question of how come museums all
*  over the world have Warhols in them?
*  The point is why do museums show Andy Warhol?
*  They show Andy Warhol because he was a transformative artist, because he took a bunch of photographs
*  and he made them mean something completely different.
*  And people look at Elvis and people look at Marilyn Monroe or Elizabeth Taylor and Prince.
*  And they say this has an entirely different message from the thing that started it all off.
*  That suggests that the answer to the question in the case, at least in the case of Warhol,
*  she says, is that he ought to be protected.
*  So what Roberts and Kagan are communicating here, besides the fact that they seem to have
*  taken art history in college and want everyone to know it, is that Warhol's take on the original
*  Prince photo is not at all a copycat.
*  And that's legally meaningful here, given the precedence and given the nature of the
*  case.
*  Right.
*  And other justices spoke in less highfalutin terms and were more skeptical of the Warhol
*  Foundation's arguments.
*  And Justice Alito, for instance, asked,
*  How is a court to determine the purpose or meaning of works of art, like a photograph
*  or a painting?
*  How am I supposed to decide what the meaning of an artwork is?
*  That's not what I learned in law school.
*  And the lawyer for the Warhol Foundation says, well, let's look at the Two Live Crew case.
*  One of the issues in the case was whether the Two Live Crew song was in fact a parody.
*  And in order to do that, the court needed to assess what the meaning or message of the
*  work was.
*  So I think you could just look at the two works and figure out what you think.
*  He says, back then, the court looked at the song and decided it had a meaning that was
*  distinct from but transformed the Roy Orbison song.
*  And that's judicial work.
*  You make it sound simple, but maybe it's not so simple, at least in some cases, to
*  determine what is the meaning or the message of a work of art.
*  There can be a lot of dispute about what the meaning or the message is.
*  And Alito says, you make it sound easy, but I'm not sure we're really up to the job.
*  So Alito is saying, I'm not comfortable declaring this to be such a transformation of the original
*  artwork that I can sympathize with Warhol the way Kagan and Roberts have.
*  That's right.
*  And other justices also hostile to the Warhol Foundation, like Justices Sonia Sotomayor
*  and Neil Gorsuch, are focused on the practical questions in the case, the particular transactions
*  between Vanity Fair and Conde Nast.
*  What does Sotomayor have to say?
*  The specific use was of this one part of the Prince series, only one level of it, as a
*  photograph in the life of Prince.
*  Now that use, you say on factor four, that it doesn't compete with Goldsmith's photograph,
*  but hard to see how not.
*  Sotomayor says, what's really at issue here is a narrow marketplace.
*  They both sell photographs to magazines and they both sell photographs to magazines to
*  display Prince's vision or Prince's look.
*  It's the marketplace of selling pictures of prints to magazines.
*  And you could argue about all kinds of other uses of what Warhol can do and can't do.
*  If Lynn Goldsmith can sell photographs of prints to magazines and Andy Warhol is selling
*  a photograph of prints created by Lynn Goldsmith with some Warhol stuff on top of it to magazines,
*  that she says is too close for comfort.
*  That she says is what copyright is meant to protect your opportunity to sell your work
*  in the same marketplace as the other guy.
*  Hmm.
*  In other words, they're both taking water out of the same well.
*  And she isn't worried about some grand artistic idea.
*  Sotomayor is saying that Warhol has borrowed from a Goldsmith photo, sold to a magazine,
*  and then used a derivative piece of art to kind of muscle his way back into that same
*  magazine marketplace.
*  And thereby, he's basically stealing food from her table.
*  That's right.
*  So by the end of the argument, it seemed that a majority, maybe a lopsided majority of the
*  court, was prepared to rule for Goldsmith.
*  Okay.
*  So walk us through the ultimate ruling in this case.
*  So in the end, the ruling was seven to two in favor of Goldsmith.
*  Justice Sotomayor writes the majority opinion.
*  And it kind of tracks her questioning at the argument, which focused on whether the Warhol
*  Foundation was required to pay a fee to Goldsmith, at least in the context of licensing images
*  to magazines.
*  If you're selling pictures of prints to magazines, and you're in the same lane as the photographer
*  whose work you were drawing on, you have an obligation under the copyright laws to compensate
*  her.
*  She says to hold otherwise would potentially authorize a range of commercial copying of
*  photographs to be used for purposes that are substantially the same as those of the originals.
*  So the majority's ruling here is that this is ultimately a kind of small scale copyright
*  infringement, and Warhol owes Goldsmith money.
*  But I'm struck by the language that Sotomayor uses, substantially the same.
*  She's kind of taking the position that what Warhol did wasn't ultimately all that transformational
*  of Goldsmith's original photograph.
*  That's right.
*  And she's called out on that by the two dissenters, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kagan, that
*  Sotomayor really minimizes what Warhol has done here.
*  Justice Kagan, who wrote the dissent, was quite slashing in criticizing what she viewed
*  as a failure of imagination or taste or something by the majority.
*  She wrote, the majority does not see it.
*  And I mean that literally.
*  There is precious little evidence in today's opinion that the majority has actually looked
*  at these images, much less that it has engaged with expert views of their aesthetics and
*  meaning.
*  Kagan also, she says, the majority decision will stifle creativity of every sort.
*  It will impede new art and music and literature.
*  It will thwart the expression of new ideas and the attainment of new knowledge.
*  It will make our world poorer.
*  So just as the majority tries to make the case small, the dissent says it's huge.
*  Well let's interrogate that prediction from Justice Kagan.
*  What does this ruling mean for the world of art?
*  If Kagan and Roberts are to be believed from that dissent, it will have a lasting and quite
*  negative impact.
*  My understanding is it's too soon to tell.
*  The majority certainly tried to write it in a small and focused way, concentrating on
*  commercial transactions in the same lane.
*  But almost all of art consists of commercial transactions.
*  And what the impact of the decision will be will turn on whether the original artist and
*  the later artists are working in the same lane.
*  We don't know yet how broad those lanes are.
*  Or how narrow those lanes are.
*  Right, so think about it this way.
*  Hanging one of the Prince series images in a museum, probably not the same commercial
*  lane.
*  But what about the postcard in the gift shop?
*  A postcard of one of these Prince images that's hanging in the museum.
*  The museum may well also have postcards of Lynn Goldsmith's work.
*  She's a noted prominent rock photographer.
*  Does that mean that in that setting we're also again in the same lane?
*  And Goldsmith is entitled to a cut of the Warhol postcard.
*  By the legal test set up by the majority, it seems that it would.
*  You would think so, yeah.
*  And the dissenters are saying that is a can of worms you don't want to open.
*  Right.
*  The dissenters say it will affect not only visual artists, but writers and musicians
*  and filmmakers.
*  And some of them will try to license the underlying work that they want to build on and won't
*  be able to afford that license fee.
*  Or maybe we'll be told that the underlying works owner is not interested in licensing
*  something.
*  And some others are going to think I would like to create new art that draws on old art,
*  but I'm scared and I'm going to go do something else instead.
*  So there is good reason to think that Justice Kagan's dissent might be a little overblown,
*  but at least at the margins, it might stifle some valuable artwork.
*  But of course, there's another way to see this outcome, Adam, which is that a new generation
*  of artists born into the aftermath of a ruling like this sees borrowing from previous artists
*  as too risky, and it unleashes a wave of original creative art and music and literature that
*  is not as reliant on everyone and everything from the past.
*  I would call that the glass half full interpretation of the Supreme Court case.
*  Right.
*  That is a very nice optimistic idea that's at odds with millennia of experience of how
*  art works.
*  Well, Adam, the risk of being very derivative of what I say at the end of every episode,
*  thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  With just days left before the U.S. hits the debt ceiling and can no longer pay its bills,
*  negotiators for Democrats and Republicans are increasingly focused on the idea of spending
*  caps, which would limit future spending as the basis for a deal that would raise the
*  debt ceiling and end the crisis.
*  Such spending caps, if agreed to by both sides, would allow Republicans to claim they have
*  won spending concessions from Democrats and allow Democrats to argue they're being fiscally
*  responsible without letting Republicans slash spending on cherished domestic programs.
*  Without a deal, the United States will hit the debt ceiling next week.
*  And on Monday, the European Union fined Metta, the parent company of Facebook, $1.3 billion
*  and ordered the company to stop transferring data collected in Europe to the United States.
*  The EU found that Metta had failed to comply with a 2020 ruling that European data shipped
*  to the U.S. was not sufficiently protected from American spy agencies.
*  Metta said it will appeal the fine.
*  Today's episode was produced by Rob Zipko, Diana Nguyen and Sydney Harper.
