*  Hey, it's Michael.
*  If you listen to podcasts, which we know you do because you're here, you know that
*  the biggest challenge is finding great stuff to listen to.
*  The times wants to make that a lot easier.
*  We're launching an audio app, NYT Audio, a single place where you can find the shows you
*  already know and love, like the Daily, the American Life, Serial, the RunUp, and discover
*  a bunch of new shows that you can't get anywhere else.
*  I want to introduce you to one of them.
*  It's called The Headlines, and it pairs perfectly with the Daily.
*  As you know, the Daily tells one big story a day.
*  But the times is covering dozens of stories a day with reporters across the world.
*  And that's where the headlines comes in.
*  It captures even more news than the Daily does in just 10 minutes.
*  And all this week, we're going to give you the headlines right here on the Daily Feed.
*  After that, you can listen to it along with the Daily on the Audio app.
*  So how do you get this app?
*  If you're a Times News or All Access subscriber, you can get it for free by going to nytimes.com
*  slash audio app or by searching NYT Audio in the App Store.
*  If you're not a subscriber, the app is the perfect reason to become one.
*  And now on to the show.
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Obaro.
*  This is a Daily.
*  A few days ago, the Supreme Court tried to answer a question that has long been devolved
*  the world of art.
*  When is borrowing from an earlier artist, an act of inspiration, and when is it theft?
*  Today, Adam Littak on the case that could change how art is made.
*  It's Tuesday, May 23rd.
*  Adam, if you'll just indulge me for a moment, how would you describe your relationship to
*  fine art?
*  I'm a dilatant.
*  My wife takes me to a lot of museums.
*  I try to be a cultured person.
*  It's noble.
*  And what are your specific thoughts about Andy Warhol?
*  Yeah, Warhol is so present in the popular culture.
*  Even though much of what he does is appropriate and comment on the culture of celebrity.
*  Even though, if I'm reading between my lines, not everyone, including you, even agrees
*  that everything Warhol does is art.
*  And just to give you my perspective on this, my experience with it, Warhol, for me,
*  is a bath book that I read to my son, Ash.
*  If you get the pages wet, the pieces of art in the book, the Brillo pad boxes, the Campbell
*  soup cans, they turn a different shade of color.
*  I mean, this is how you ubiquitous Andy Warhol has become.
*  He is in the bathtub.
*  Right.
*  And in museums around the world display his work and it's worth cumulatively hundreds
*  of millions if not a billion dollars.
*  Right.
*  And the reason we're talking to you about Warhol is not because we're here to debate
*  the relative merits or valuations of his pieces, but because he is the subject of a pretty
*  important Supreme Court rule, when they came down a few days ago and that I think got
*  a little bit lost in the shuffle of the news.
*  So tell us about that case.
*  So you know, Michael, we often talk about the blockbuster cases involving huge social
*  issues, abortion, affirmative action, gay rights, religion, but the court also can issue
*  quite important, consequential decisions about all kinds of areas of American life.
*  And this case that came down a couple of days ago involves a quite large question about
*  what artists can do and how much they can make use of draw on, engage in a conversation
*  with earlier works or whether that crosses a line of copyright infringement.
*  Hmm.
*  In other words, the Supreme Court weighed in on when is art appropriation?
*  When is it honorary borrowing?
*  When is it theft?
*  Right.
*  Or when is it such a transformation that it's created something wholly new or protectable
*  in its own right?
*  And where does this case at him begin?
*  It starts in 1981 when the rock musician prints is starting to get famous.
*  His album Controversy comes out.
*  He hosts Saturday Night Live.
*  And now here's Prince.
*  Party up, one, two, three.
*  And a prominent rock photographer, Lynn Goldsmith, thinks it's time to get some photographs of
*  him.
*  She gets a commission from Newsweek magazine.
*  She takes some concert photos and some portraits.
*  And one portrait in particular, which will be at the center of this case, black and white
*  shows Prince kind of illiterate, vulnerable.
*  It's a striking photograph of a young rock musician.
*  A couple years later, 1984, Prince is turning into a superstar.
*  His album Purple Rain is coming out.
*  And Vanity Fair wants to do an article on him and asks Andy Warhol, the very prominent
*  artist, to illustrate it.
*  And they obtained for Warhol one of Lynn Goldsmith's portraits as an artist's reference.
*  They pair 400 bucks and tell her they will use it once.
*  And Warhol gets to work and alters the photograph.
*  He kind of crops it.
*  He colors it purple.
*  He sort of shades Prince's eyes.
*  And it's a very different looking kind of disemmodied head that Art Critics say is not
*  that kind of lonely illiterate portrait of Prince, but is a kind of view of modern
*  celebrity, or so the Art Critics say.
*  So Vanity Fair publishes that silk screen image by Warhol based on the Goldsmith's photo.
*  Warhol also goes off and creates 15 other variations on the Goldsmith photo.
*  And this is common with Warhol.
*  He will do various versions of photos of celebrities.
*  Right.
*  The Maryland's, etc.
*  Right.
*  And then when Warhol dies in 1987, those images and all of his other artwork and all
*  of the copyrights in them go to the Andy Warhol Foundation for visual arts.
*  Then in 2016, Prince himself dies.
*  And Vanity Fair's parent company, Condi Nass, puts together a special magazine celebrating
*  Prince's life.
*  And it wants to find a cover image and it goes to the Andy Warhol Foundation and say,
*  what do you got?
*  And they take a different image from this series and put it on the cover and pay the foundation
*  $10,000.
*  And Lin Goldsmith gets no money and no credit.
*  And when she becomes aware of this use of her work, she says, wait a second, that's copyright
*  infringement.
*  You're not allowed to do that.
*  And what does the Warhol Foundation have to say about that?
*  The Warhol Foundation launches a lawsuit.
*  Huh.
*  And what is their rationale for filing a lawsuit and making that argument because they
*  could just have paid her off, right?
*  You know, we're not privy to the settlement negotiations, but at the argument, the Warhol
*  Foundation's lawyers said that Goldsmith had asked for a quite substantial seven figure
*  sum.
*  But the lawsuit also has a larger purpose.
*  And it's a purpose that the Warhol Foundation has to care deeply about because it goes to
*  the heart of Warhol's work.
*  And they want to make the case that under the copyright laws and under the so-called fair
*  use exception to copyright infringement, it's important to create some space for later
*  artists to make use of earlier works.
*  So the Warhol Foundation is trying to make a point about the need to protect artistic
*  expression that builds on appropriates and transforms earlier works.
*  Right.
*  So for the Warhol Foundation, this is not about one payment, one lawsuit, one anything.
*  This is a more existential question of whether an artist like Warhol gets to practice their
*  craft, which involves borrowing and appropriating on a pretty large scale.
*  That's right.
*  And the court has looked at this question in a slightly different context before.
*  In 1994, in a case involving the rap group, Two Life Crew and Roy Orbison, one of the founding
*  fathers of rock and roll.
*  Two Life Crew wanted to have some fun with the Roy Orbison hit Pretty Woman and substitute
*  other characters for Pretty Woman.
*  Like, Big Harry Woman.
*  Right.
*  And two time in Woman, I know a song.
*  The owners of those rights of the Orbison song flatly said no.
*  We don't want to be involved in a parody that transforms a Pretty Woman into a Harry
*  Woman.
*  No, thank you.
*  Two Life Crew does it anyway.
*  It takes its chances.
*  Has a big hit.
*  They get sued.
*  And the Supreme Court said, well, if it's parody, that's in the nature of fair use.
*  And comment, criticism, parody gets protected because otherwise you couldn't do it at all.
*  Got it.
*  So from where the Warhol Foundation sits, it looks like a very big and very important precedent
*  case that it can call upon in its dispute with Lynn Goldsmith would seem to favor Warhol's
*  approach to art, which is cumulative.
*  It is borrow-ish.
*  That is what Two Life Crew did to the Orbison.
*  So that's mostly right.
*  Although there may be a key distinction where Two Life Crew is engaging with and commenting
*  on the earlier work, it's not clear that Warhol is saying anything about the Goldsmith
*  photo.
*  He's using it, yes.
*  But is he actually engaging with it?
*  Is he actually saying something about it?
*  Could he just have easily gone to any other photograph of Prince to do his Warhol number
*  on that photograph?
*  So there's some real gray area in this Warhol lawsuit.
*  So tell us about the oral arguments.
*  In this case, once it hits the nine justices of the Supreme Court.
*  We'll hear argument first this morning in case number 21, 869, Andy Warhol Foundation
*  versus Goldsmith.
*  Mr. Martinez?
*  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.
*  Both Court-
*  So the lawyer for the Warhol Foundation, Roman Martinez, makes two basic points, one focused
*  and one quite large.
*  Warhol's Prince series can reasonably be perceived to convey a fundamentally different
*  meaning or message from Goldsmith's photograph.
*  The question in this case-
*  The focus argument is that he maintains that all you need to do is look at the Warhol
*  piece.
*  And you will see that it conveys a fundamentally different message that its meaning is different
*  from the photograph and that it should be protected for that reason.
*  Finally, the stakes for artistic expression in this case are high.
*  His larger point is that it's not about one image of Prince.
*  It's about the nature of how art works.
*  A ruling for Goldsmith would strip protection not just from this Prince series, but from
*  countless works of modern and contemporary art.
*  And that lots of visual and other kinds of art, music, literature works because the
*  later work is building on, commenting on, in dialogue with the earlier work.
*  It would make it illegal for artists, museums, galleries and collectors to display, sell,
*  profit from, maybe even possess a significant quantity of works.
*  It would also change.
*  And for the Supreme Court to say that the copyright law is so rigid that it doesn't allow for
*  that kind of expression would do grave damage to the artistic community.
*  Not just damage to Warhol, but basically to any artist who does what Warhol does, of
*  which there are thousands.
*  Yes, certainly visual art, but also all kinds of art.
*  And what about the other side, Adam?
*  What two lawyers for Lynn Goldsmith tell the justices?
*  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.
*  Fair use, isn't it?
*  Goldsmiths, lawyer Lisa Black, says the question isn't whether Warhol was a genius or an artist.
*  The question was whether he or his foundation should have paid Goldsmith when he built on
*  her work that there should be no kind of Warhol exception for this genius.
*  Petitioner responds Warhol is a creative genius who imbued other people's art with his own
*  distinctive style.
*  But Spielberg did the same for films and Jimmy Hendrix for music.
*  Those giants still needed licenses.
*  Even when...
*  That this nice phrase copyrights will be a diversity of copycats if the court rules for Warhol.
*  Anyone could turn Darth Vader into a hero or spin off all the family into the Jefferson's
*  without paying the creators a dime.
*  And welcome your questions.
*  So both sides seem to be making the most extreme arguments they can think of.
*  And the justices as they weigh in on the case also seem to be staking out quite extreme positions.
*  We'll do it back.
*  So Adam, during the oral arguments in this case, what do the justices have to say about Warhol,
*  Goldsmith and the merits of this case?
*  There are basically two schools of thought.
*  A couple of the justices, and they're not typically allies, really seem to be taken by
*  the quality of Warhol's art and suggested at least when we're talking about Andy Warhol,
*  you really ought to let him have some room to maneuver.
*  What justices?
*  Well Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Kagan.
*  You said that the only thing that's different was the distinctive style of Warhol.
*  I think your friend's point is broader than that.
*  Roberts completely buys in to the idea that Warhol is sending a different message.
*  It's not just that Warhol has a different style.
*  It's that unlike Goldsmith's photograph, Warhol sends a message about the depersonalization
*  of modern culture and celebrity status.
*  So it's not just a different style.
*  It's a different purpose.
*  One is the commentary on modern society.
*  The other is to show what Prince looks like.
*  Yes.
*  Kagan, in slightly more colloquial terms, asked the question of how come museums all over
*  the world have Warhol's in them?
*  The point is why do museums show Andy Warhol?
*  They show Andy Warhol because he was a transformative artist because he took a bunch
*  of photographs and he made them mean something completely different.
*  People look at Elvis and people look at Marilyn Monroe or Elizabeth Taylor and Prince.
*  They say this has an entirely different message from the thing that started it all off.
*  That suggests that the answer to the question in the case, at least in the case of Warhol,
*  she says, is that he ought to be protected.
*  So what Roberts and Kagan are communicating here, besides the fact that they seem to
*  have taken art history in college and one of the ones to know it, is that Warhol's take
*  on the original Prince photo is not at all a copycat.
*  And that's legally meaningful here, given the precedence and given the nature of the case.
*  Right.
*  And other justices spoken less highfalutin terms and were more skeptical of the Warhol
*  Foundation's arguments.
*  And Justice Alito, for instance, asked, how is a court to determine the purpose or meaning
*  of works of art like a photograph or a painting?
*  How am I supposed to decide what the meaning of an artwork is?
*  That's not what I learned in law school.
*  And the lawyer for the Warhol Foundation says, well, let's look at the two-life crew
*  case.
*  The issues in the case was whether the two-life crew song was, in fact, a parody.
*  In order to do that, the court needed to assess what the meaning or message of the work
*  was.
*  So I think you could just look at the two works and figure out what you think.
*  It says, back then, the court looked at the song and decided it had a meaning that was
*  distinct from but transformed the Royal Orbison song, and that's judicial work.
*  You make it sound simple, but maybe it's not so simple, at least in some cases.
*  To determine what is the meaning or the message of the work of art.
*  There can be a lot of dispute about what the meaning or the message is.
*  And Alito says, you make it sound easy, but I'm not sure we're really up to the job.
*  Hmm.
*  So Alito is saying, I'm not comfortable declaring this to be such a transformation of the original
*  artwork that I can sympathize with Warhol, the way Kagan and Roberts have.
*  That's right.
*  And other justices also hostile to the Warhol Foundation, like justices Sonia Sotomayor
*  and Neil Gorsuch are focused on the practical questions in the case, the particular transactions
*  between vanity fair and conda inest.
*  And what does that my order have to say?
*  The specific use was of this one part of the print series, only one level of it, as
*  a photograph in the life of prints.
*  Now that use, you say on factor four, that it doesn't compete with both Smith's photograph,
*  but the hard to see how not.
*  So to my order says what's really an issue here is a narrow marketplace.
*  They both sell photographs to magazines and they both sell photographs to magazines to
*  display prints vision or prints as look.
*  It's the marketplace of selling pictures of prints to magazines.
*  And you could argue about all kinds of other uses of what Warhol can do and can't do.
*  But if Lynn Goldsmith can sell photographs of prints to magazines, and Andy Warhol
*  is selling a photograph of prints created by Lynn Goldsmith with some more whole stuff
*  on top of it to magazines, that she says is too close for comfort, that she says is what
*  copyright is meant to protect your opportunity to sell your work in the same marketplace
*  as the other guy.
*  In other words, they're both taking water out of the same well.
*  And she isn't worried about some grand artistic idea.
*  So to my order saying that Warhol has borrowed from a Goldsmith photo sold to a magazine
*  and then used a derivative piece of art to kind of muscle his way back into that same magazine
*  marketplace.
*  And thereby he's basically stealing food from her table.
*  That's right.
*  So by the end of the argument, it seemed that a majority, maybe a lopsided majority of
*  the court was prepared to rule for Goldsmith.
*  Okay.
*  So we'll talk us through the ultimate ruling in this case.
*  So in the end, the ruling was seven to two in favor of Goldsmith.
*  Justice Sotomayor writes the majority opinion and it kind of tracks her questioning at
*  the argument, which focused on whether the Warhol Foundation was required to pay a fee
*  to Goldsmith, at least in the context of licensing images to magazines.
*  If you're selling pictures of prints to magazines, you're in the same lane as the photographer
*  whose work you were drawing on, you have an obligation under the copyright laws to compensate
*  her.
*  She says to hold otherwise, would potentially authorize a range of commercial copying
*  of photographs to be used for purposes that are substantially the same as those of the
*  originals.
*  So the majority's ruling here is that this is ultimately a kind of small scale copyright
*  infringement and Warhol owes Goldsmith money.
*  But I'm struck by the language that Sotomayor uses substantially the same.
*  She's kind of taking the position that what Warhol did wasn't ultimately all that transfer
*  to the original formational of Goldsmith's original photograph.
*  That's right.
*  And she's called out on that by the two dissenters.
*  She's Justice Roberts and Justice Kagan, that Sotomayor really minimizes what Warhol has
*  done here.
*  Justice Kagan who wrote the dissent was quite slashing in criticizing what she viewed as
*  a failure of imagination or taste or something by the majority.
*  She wrote, the majority does not see it.
*  And I mean that literally.
*  There is precious little evidence in today's opinion that the majority is actually looked
*  at these images, much less that it has engaged with expert views of their aesthetics and
*  meaning.
*  Tegan also, she says the majority decision will stifle creativity of every sort.
*  It will impede new art and music and literature.
*  It will thwart the expression of new ideas and the attainment of new knowledge.
*  It will make our world poorer.
*  So just as the majority tries to make the case small, the dissent says it's huge.
*  Well, let's interrogate that prediction from Justice Kagan.
*  What does this ruling mean for the world of art?
*  If Kagan and Roberts are to be believed from that dissent, it will have a lasting and
*  quite negative impact.
*  My understanding is it's too soon to tell.
*  The majority certainly tried to write it in a small and focused way, concentrating on
*  commercial transactions in the same lane.
*  But almost all of art consists of commercial transactions.
*  And what the impact of the decision will be, will turn on whether the original artists
*  and the later artists are working in the same lane.
*  And we don't know yet how broad those lanes are.
*  Or how narrow those lanes are.
*  Right.
*  So think about it this way.
*  Hanging one of the Prince series images in a museum, probably not the same commercial
*  lane.
*  What about the postcard in the gift shop?
*  A postcard of one of these Prince images that's hanging in the museum.
*  The museum may well also have postcards of Lin Goldsmith's work.
*  She's a noted prominent rock photographer.
*  Does that mean that in that setting, we're also again in the same lane.
*  And Goldsmith is entitled to a cut of the warhole postcard.
*  By the legal test set up by the majority, it seems that it would.
*  You would think so, yeah.
*  And the dissenters are saying that is a can of worms you don't want to open.
*  Right.
*  The dissenters say it will affect not only visual artists, but writers and musicians and
*  film makers.
*  And some of them will try to license the underlying work that they want to build on.
*  And won't be able to afford that license fee or maybe we'll be told that the underlying
*  work's owner is not interested in licensing something.
*  And some others are going to think I would like to create new art that draws on old art,
*  but I'm scared.
*  And I'm going to go do something else instead.
*  So there is good reason to think that Justice Kagan's dissent might be a little overblown.
*  And at least the margins, it might stifle some valuable artwork.
*  But of course, there's another way to see this outcome at them, which is that a new generation
*  of artists born into the aftermath of a ruling like this sees borrowing from previous
*  artists as too risky.
*  And it unleashes a wave of original creative art and music and literature that is not
*  as reliant on everyone and everything from the past.
*  I would call that the glass half full interpretation of the Supreme Court case.
*  Right.
*  That is a very nice optimistic idea that's in odds with millennia of experience of how
*  art works.
*  Well, Adam, the risk of being very derivative of what I say at the end of every episode,
*  thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today with just days left before the US hits the
*  dead sailing and can no longer pay its bills.
*  Negotiators for Democrats and Republicans are increasingly focused on the idea of spending
*  caps, which would limit future spending as the basis for a deal that would raise the
*  dead ceiling and end the crisis.
*  Such spending caps, if agreed to by both sides, would allow Republicans to claim they have
*  one spending concessions from Democrats and allow Democrats to argue they're being
*  fiscally responsible without letting Republicans slash spending on cherished domestic programs.
*  Without a deal, the United States will hit the dead ceiling next week.
*  And on Monday, the European Union fined Meta, the parent company of Facebook, $1.3 billion
*  dollars, and ordered the company to stop transferring data collected in Europe to the United States.
*  The EU found that Meta had failed to comply with a 2020 ruling that European data shipped
*  to the US was not sufficiently protected from American spy agencies.
*  Meta said it will appeal the fine.
