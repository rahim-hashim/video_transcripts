# Botox, Hermès and OnlyFans: Why This May Be George Santos’s Last Week in Congress
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3XN_l8jHOE)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Only five members of the U.S. House of Representatives have ever been expelled from the institution.
*  This week, Republican Representative George Santos of New York could very well become
*  the sixth.
*  My colleague, Grace Ashford, explains why after a year in office, so many of Santos's
*  colleagues from both parties have had enough.
*  It's Monday, November 27th.
*  So Grace, welcome back to the show.
*  Hey Michael, good to be back.
*  So we haven't talked in a while.
*  The last time you were on the show, George Santos was not yet a member of Congress.
*  He was a congressman-elect.
*  And you had discovered, along with our colleagues in your collective reporting, that Santos
*  had fabricated much of his life story, really basic facts about his career, his education.
*  It caused a huge uproar.
*  Nevertheless, he is sworn into office, and then his life gets incredibly messy.
*  That's right, Michael.
*  So last December, shortly after our first story came out, federal investigators at the
*  Department of Justice opened an inquiry.
*  In March, the House Ethics Committee announces a parallel investigation.
*  And then in May, the DOJ actually charges Santos with over a dozen felonies.
*  In October, they add 10 more charges, including aggravated identity theft.
*  And through all of this, Santos stands strong and resolute.
*  He says he's innocent.
*  He says he's going to remain in Congress to serve his constituents.
*  And there for a while, it looked as though he was maybe going to be able to actually
*  outrun all of this, all of these attempts to bring accountability.
*  He was the subject of two expulsion efforts, both of which failed.
*  The first is led by Democrats, and it gets tabled by Republicans, who say the investigation
*  should be allowed to run their course.
*  The second is led by this cadre of Republicans from New York.
*  And this also fails resoundingly.
*  Not only does it fail to get the two thirds majority that it needs to pass, it doesn't
*  even get a simple majority because of how many Democrats voted against it.
*  Well, just explain that.
*  Why would Democrats vote against this and vote to keep Santos in office?
*  Well, I think for a lot of people, they look at Santos as not just being about Santos,
*  but always about precedent.
*  And once we start getting into a place where on the basis of news reports, on the basis
*  of accusations, a member can be removed from the office that they were duly elected to,
*  I think there are a lot of people on both sides of the aisle that found that to be pretty
*  concerning.
*  So Democrats said, let's wait.
*  Let's not rush to judgment.
*  Let's wait and sort of see the evidence that comes either from the criminal case or from
*  this ethics investigation, which they knew at that point was pretty close to its conclusion.
*  And so that's really where things stood until the release of this really damning ethics
*  report the week before Thanksgiving.
*  Okay, so tell us about this report.
*  So this report is the culmination of months and months and months of investigative work.
*  The committee issued dozens of subpoenas.
*  They interviewed, I think, nearly 40 witnesses.
*  They reviewed tens of thousands of pages of documents looking for evidence that he had
*  violated House ethics rules, but also federal law.
*  And all this culminates with the filing of a third resolution to expel Congressman Santos
*  coming from the chairman of the House Ethics Committee, a Republican from Mississippi.
*  And this is really the most serious challenge that Congressman Santos has faced yet.
*  And it's all going to come to a head in the coming week.
*  Right, because later this week there's going to be a vote on the House floor to formally
*  remove Santos from Congress.
*  And from everything you're saying, it sounds like the third time could be the real time.
*  It actually could happen.
*  This is definitely the most serious of these challenges thus far.
*  So what did House ethics investigators who put this report together actually find?
*  Well, they lay out what I think is one of the most kind of comprehensive theories of
*  the case in terms of Congressman Santos.
*  And they put it right at the top of their report.
*  They say that they have found substantial evidence that he violated both House ethics
*  rules and criminal law.
*  And specifically, they say that he sought to fraudulently exploit every aspect of his
*  candidacy for personal financial profit.
*  Hmm, basically turned the idea of running for Congress into a kind of personal piggy bank.
*  As though the four years that he spent campaigning and running for office was one long-running
*  grift that would allow him to enrich himself.
*  Okay, and what are the specifics that the report establishes to support that claim?
*  Well, I think our listeners are somewhat familiar now with some of the biographical embellishments
*  that we've reported about Congressman Santos.
*  This sort of story that he told about himself, that he worked on Wall Street, and that he's
*  a successful businessman.
*  The report really digs into this narrative that he's putting forth and shows how this
*  kind of works as a big circle.
*  He portrays himself as the successful businessman in order to solicit funds from donors, donors
*  buy into it and buy into him, give him money that he then funnels to himself.
*  And now we can see from this ethics report all of the ways in which he is finding ways
*  to take that money and bring it back to himself.
*  For example, one of the biggest questions that I had as a reporter from the very beginning
*  of my time looking into George Santos was about the large personal loans that he reported
*  having made to his campaign.
*  Right, he claimed that that successful businessman that he wasn't, but that he claimed to be,
*  was capable of giving his campaign a lot of money.
*  This is really central to this image that he has of himself as a successful businessman
*  is that he has all this money that he can loan to his campaign.
*  In 2020, he says he loans himself more than $80,000.
*  In 2022, that number skyrockets, it's more than $700,000.
*  Wow.
*  And now for the first time, we have a lot more details about what was really going on there.
*  What exactly was going on with those alleged loans from Santos to his campaign?
*  Well, in 2020, Santos reports that he loans over $80,000 to his campaign over a series
*  of transactions.
*  This is a little bit unusual because according to the financial disclosure that he files
*  with the House that same year, it says that he's only earning $55,000 a year and he has
*  no savings.
*  What we didn't know, but we do know now, is that in fact, he did not loan his campaign
*  $80,000.
*  He loaned his campaign $3,500.
*  So why make that claim?
*  Two reasons.
*  The first is that it made his campaign look a lot more successful on paper than it was
*  in reality.
*  And successful campaigns draw more donors and more support.
*  And number two, it gave him this mechanism through which he could actually repay himself
*  for the loan that he hadn't really fully made in the process collecting tens of thousands
*  of dollars of profit.
*  So he basically discovers if you tell the world that you have loaned your campaign money
*  that you didn't have, no one seems to check.
*  And you can then reimburse yourself for some of that money, all that money, and basically
*  just steal from your campaign.
*  Yes.
*  And according to the Ethics Report, this is not the only way that he finds to divert campaign
*  funds and donor funds into his own pocket.
*  What are the other ways?
*  So the other thing we learn about in great detail is this Florida company called Red
*  strategies that Santos had been using during his 2022 congressional campaign.
*  And we learned that he has been using it as sort of an intermediary where he will transfer
*  money from other places, other accounts into Redstone strategies, at which point it sort
*  of becomes his to do what he wants with it.
*  We'd heard a bit about Redstone before.
*  He was actually charged back in May with having stolen $50,000 from two different donors using
*  Redstone.
*  He had told them that it was a type of independent expenditure committee and that the money would
*  be used to fund ads.
*  But no ads were ever bought.
*  And in fact, we can see now from the report that a lot of that money just went straight
*  into Santos's pocket.
*  Just how much money was Santos able to extract from this company, Redstone?
*  Well the number that the ethics report gives is $200,000.
*  Wow.
*  Does the report say how much money overall that Santos took from his donors, from his
*  campaign gaffers?
*  So it's really hard to come up with a single number that encapsulates all of this because
*  there are so many profit streams.
*  But at one point, investigators mentioned that Santos withdrew nearly a quarter of a
*  million dollars in cash from his various bank accounts.
*  And we have no idea what became of that.
*  Wow.
*  But it's not even just the money that he explicitly pulled out of his campaign that concerns them.
*  There's this whole sort of other category of campaign spending that they give us a lot
*  of details on, which is really just how he used the campaign to fund his life.
*  So walk us through those in as much detail as you can.
*  Well as we sort of said at the top, key to the story that George Santos is telling about
*  himself is this notion that he is a very wealthy person with excellent taste who's able to
*  kind of live the high life.
*  And in this ethics report, we get to see just how high that life was.
*  This report is loaded with horrible, inexcusable, totally juicy details.
*  The damning 56 page report finding Santos allegedly using thousands of dollars in campaign
*  funds on trips to Atlantic City and even to pay his own rent.
*  We learn about trips to Atlantic City.
*  Apparently he told a staffer that he liked playing roulette.
*  The report also specifically detailed a list of suspicious campaign expenditures, including
*  more than ten thousand dollars on fashion at Hermes and Ferragamo.
*  We learn about thousands of dollars that he spent at luxury stores.
*  Fourteen hundred at a medical spa that performs Botox treatments.
*  We learn about thousands of dollars worth of spa treatments, a number of which are actually
*  identified as being for Botox in documents.
*  And smaller purchases at OnlyFans, a website often used for adult content and pornography.
*  One of the expenditures that drew the most attention was a payment to the website OnlyFans.
*  This obviously raises some eyebrows because it's not generally how people would like
*  their political donations to be spent, but also because there is a video of George Santos
*  telling a television reporter that he has no idea what OnlyFans was and he'd only learned
*  about it very recently, which is again hard to square with a payment like this.
*  And Grace, there's no world in which the expenses we're talking about can be construed as campaign
*  expenses, and thus they are violations of campaign finance laws.
*  It's very hard to make the case that payments to, you know, designer stores and on fancy
*  hotel stays benefit the people of New York's third congressional district.
*  And so when Congress members and their staff get finished reading this report, there's
*  this real sense that the tides have shifted for Congressman Santos, that all of the evidence
*  that they were looking for has now been laid out in stark detail, details that are going
*  to be very difficult to explain away, let alone forget.
*  Now they've seen what they needed to see and they are ready to move to expel Congressman Santos.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Grace, how is everyone in Congress thinking about and talking about this upcoming vote
*  to expel Santos, this third effort to push him out of the House and from everything you've
*  said, the gravest threat so far to his career in Congress?
*  Well, Congress is kind of a buzz with the details of this report and, you know, what
*  it might mean for this upcoming vote.
*  We're seeing signs on both sides of the aisle that these reports are going to be very, very
*  vile, that these revelations have had a real impact on the way people are thinking about
*  this very consequential decision.
*  Probably the most interesting response comes from Santos himself.
*  While he calls the report a smear, he says that if the ethics committee had any ethics,
*  they wouldn't have released it.
*  He nonetheless also kind of seems to bow to some of this news and makes the announcement
*  that in fact he will not run for reelection in 2024.
*  Something he has previously never been willing to say.
*  No, and it's actually, I think, a pretty consequential shift for him in terms of the story that he's
*  been telling because, you know, he has been steadfast in saying that he is innocent of
*  everything he's been accused of and that he will continue to serve his constituents and
*  that he will be reelected even.
*  And so this is the first time we're starting to see that perhaps he is letting go of that
*  vision as well.
*  Interesting. Should we see that announcement, him saying I'm not going to run for reelection,
*  as an attempt to kind of head off this expulsion vote as a way of saying I'll see my own way
*  out so there's no reason to force me out the door?
*  Well, you know, perhaps, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that he is necessarily going to
*  see himself out.
*  Notably, his announcement does not come with any promise to resign from office.
*  He in fact says he will continue to serve as long as he is allowed.
*  Okay, well, given that complex Santos reaction, I'm not running for reelection, but I won't
*  resign, how are both Democrats and Republicans of the House thinking about this vote and
*  whether they're going to remove him from Congress?
*  Well, for Democrats, this is a little simpler.
*  Many of those Democrats who initially were, you know, worried about setting a dangerous
*  precedent, about, you know, kind of rushing to judgment, now feel that in this ethics report,
*  they have the formal finding that makes them, you know, kind of confident to make a decision like
*  this, great as it is.
*  Probably one of the highest profile of those is Representative Jamie Raskin from Maryland,
*  who initially had voted to protect Mr. Santos to avoid setting a precedent of, he said,
*  expelling people based on intuition, you know, without criminal convictions or disciplinary findings.
*  In the face of this report, though, he said that he thought that it was very clear what the duty of the
*  House was, and that was to expel.
*  Got it. So Democrats seem very much ready en masse to vote to expel Santos.
*  What about House Republicans?
*  Well, this is where things get a little trickier.
*  So there were already a group of Republicans that had been pushing pretty vocally to expel
*  Congressman Santos, many of whom hail from New York.
*  And in fact, most of those are people who were elected in 2020, the same year that Santos was,
*  and represent these kind of moderate districts in the Hudson Valley and on Long Island,
*  where they have been already targeted for being on the same party as Congressman Santos.
*  Right. And of course, their moderate constituents probably won't hold it against them to vote
*  to expel Santos because they're not hugely partisan districts.
*  I think that's part of the calculation.
*  And so now what we're seeing is that those lawmakers are having some success in persuading their
*  colleagues to support an effort to expel.
*  And what are some examples of those Republicans who are kind of flipping toward expulsion?
*  Republicans are showing us they do have the ability to call out one of their own.
*  I did not vote in the past to expel George because I didn't believe there was due process.
*  And so the ethics committee really, I think, gave him the opportunity.
*  He did not avail himself of that opportunity.
*  The ethics committee found that he did not cooperate.
*  I think he's been given the fair due process now.
*  There's Representative Ken Buck from Colorado.
*  Congressman Greg Murphy of North Carolina said that Santos's actions were reprehensible
*  and he was not worthy of being a member of Congress.
*  There's Representative Greg Murphy.
*  Congresswoman Ashley Hinson of Iowa said the conduct was illegal and unacceptable
*  and Americans deserve better from their representatives.
*  Republican Zach Nunn says it's time for Santos to go.
*  The people of America deserve better and we're going to make sure he's held accountable,
*  just as we would anyone who has violated federal law.
*  There are three representatives from Iowa, Zach Nunn, Ashley Hinson and Marionette Miller Meeks.
*  We were able to see that he inappropriately used donor money for all these other things for personal gain.
*  As well as in New York State, Nicole Maliotakis.
*  And that was enough for us to say he should no longer be serving as a member of Congress.
*  And one way that we can see just how significant this shift within the Republican Party is,
*  is that the current resolution to expel Santos was introduced by the Republican chairman
*  of the House Ethics Committee, Michael Guest from Mississippi.
*  But now the Ethics Committee chairman putting his weight behind this in a real signal
*  that he believes that the conduct that his committee, this bipartisan committee has found,
*  should warrant George Santos being kicked out of the House.
*  In the last round, he didn't vote to expel Santos and he didn't vote to protect him either, he voted present.
*  And this time, he himself is leading the charge.
*  We've passed that due process point and it's time for members of Congress to make a personal decision
*  as to whether or not to appeal the evidence is substantial.
*  Fascinating. So where does all of this leave the math around expulsion for when this comes to a vote?
*  Expulsion requires a two-thirds majority, that's a lot.
*  Most things in the House are done by simple majority.
*  How close is the House with all these Democrats who are flipping and Republicans who are flipping towards expulsion
*  to actually expelling Santos?
*  Yeah, it is an incredibly high bar.
*  And it was made an incredibly high bar on purpose because this is an incredibly significant decision.
*  But by our calculation, even if every single Democrat were to vote to remove Santos,
*  you would still need more than 70 Republicans to do the same in order to have that motion carry.
*  And how many of those 70 Republicans have publicly said they're ready to vote to expel?
*  So what we can say, we know that in the last expulsion resolution, 24 Republicans voted to remove Santos.
*  Since that time, little over a dozen have publicly said that they have changed their mind
*  and would now support an expulsion resolution.
*  That brings us to just under 40, but that's not 70.
*  And so I think the question really is for all of the rest of the Republican conference
*  who have now gone home from Washington, many of them are probably with their families
*  over the Thanksgiving holiday, thinking this over.
*  What kind of decision are they going to make when they return to Washington?
*  Well, what would be the best and the strongest argument for House Republicans to protect Santos
*  given the incredibly damning revelations of this House ethics report?
*  Well, there's sort of a historical one and a political one.
*  Historically, if Santos were to be removed based on this ethics report,
*  he would be only the sixth member in congressional history to be removed from the House of Representatives.
*  Three of those were expelled for supporting the Confederacy.
*  And the other two were expelled for after they were criminally convicted.
*  Santos, of course, has not been criminally convicted.
*  His trial is currently set for September of 2024.
*  What about the political case for sparing him?
*  Well, Republicans have been struggling since they took control of the House in 2022
*  with the fact that their majority is so, so, so narrow.
*  Just a couple of votes losing Santos's vote would make that majority even narrower.
*  So the fear for Republicans is that they will lose this seat because if Santos is removed
*  and if I'm remembering the rules correctly, there's a special election for his seat,
*  which you have, Grace, told us is a moderate swing district on Long Island.
*  I'm guessing the fear for Republicans is that a Democrat scoops that seat up
*  and the Republican majority becomes one vote smaller.
*  Yeah, I think that's the nightmare scenario, that a Democrat is able to take advantage
*  of this kind of black eye for the Republican Party on Long Island.
*  And then not only do they win the special election, but then they are in a good position
*  to come in and win the general as well.
*  Well, Grace, given this complex math, given the uncertainty that Santos will be expelled
*  when the House votes later this week, given the reality that many Republicans don't want to lose
*  even a single member of their majority, I'm curious what it's going to really mean if this vote fails.
*  Because, as you told us, Santos is going to leave Congress at the end of his term.
*  So what would we really take from the fact that he's not expelled,
*  but instead has been basically browbeaten into leaving on his own?
*  Well, I think it would be a real inflection point.
*  The House Ethics Committee in its report said that Congressman Santos's behavior warranted
*  public condemnation, was beneath the dignity of the office, and had brought severe discredit upon the House.
*  That was in their words.
*  If the majority of House members read that same report about all of that conduct,
*  all of the times that he blatantly stole from the campaign, lied to donors, enriched himself,
*  and they say, no, actually, we're okay with that. That says something.
*  I think it's another in this series of moments where we as a country, as a political system,
*  are redefining what's allowable and what we can accept.
*  I have one last question for you, Grace.
*  You've now been covering Congressman Santos for the entirety of his career in Congress,
*  which isn't that long, but you've gotten to know it arguably better than anyone,
*  and you've gotten to know him arguably better than anyone.
*  Now this report is out, and we're reaching this potentially historic moment in Santos' career.
*  I wonder if you've gotten any closer to understanding what might be the biggest question of all about George Santos,
*  which is why he has done all the things that he has done.
*  I think because he can.
*  Hmm.
*  I think one could argue that up until this month even, he has been really, really successful
*  in creating the reality that he wants, in talking people into, in turning nothing into something,
*  in getting people to believe whatever he tells them.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  And it seemed like he was going to be able to continue to take that as far as he could.
*  Yes, there is this criminal investigation going on.
*  Yes, he is facing some real charges.
*  But in another way, a trial is just another opportunity to tell a story,
*  and Congressman Santos is great at telling stories.
*  I think that the closest you can get to answering that question is that he thought that it would work
*  because it had worked for a long time, until it didn't.
*  Well, Grace, thank you very much. We really appreciate it.
*  Thanks so much, Michael.
*  On Friday evening, during a profanity-laced tirade on X-Spaces,
*  Representative Santos said that he expects the House to expel him in the coming days.
*  But instead of appealing to his colleagues for leniency,
*  Santos lashed out at them, calling them, quote,
*  Santos said that if he is removed from the House, he would consider it, quote,
*  I know I'm going to get expelled when this expulsion resolution goes to the floor,
*  People are so quick to judge and ask and demand for political expediency.
*  And this is what this is. It's political expediency.
*  So I've had it. I'm very well resolved as a human being.
*  So throw this at me. Hit me with your best shot at this point.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Over the weekend, Hamas released 40 Israeli hostages, many of them children,
*  that it had taken into Gaza during its October 7 attack on Israel.
*  The releases, which began on Friday, involved a series of handovers
*  that required Israel to free an even larger number of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
*  Those exchanges are part of a deal brokered by Qatar and the U.S.
*  that requires a days-long pause in fighting that is set to end today.
*  This deal is structured so that it can be extended to keep building on these results.
*  That's my goal. That's our goal to keep this pause going beyond tomorrow.
*  But in a speech on Sunday, President Biden said he hoped that the truce could be extended,
*  an idea that Hamas says it is open to.
*  We've seen this is a day-by-day approach, hour-by-hour process.
*  Nothing is guaranteed and nothing is being taken for granted.
*  But the proof that this is working and worth pursuing further is in every smile
*  and every grateful tear we see on the faces of those families who are finally getting back together again.
