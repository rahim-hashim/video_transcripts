# Stranded in Rafah as an Israeli Invasion Looms
**New York Times Podcasts:** [February 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFuNntqsSYs)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  In four months of war, Israel has regularly warned residents of the Gaza Strip to move
*  south for safety.
*  As a result, more than a million Gazans, about half the population of the entire enclave,
*  have ended up in the city of Rafa.
*  Now, as the war enters its fifth month, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that
*  the next phase of Israel's fight against Hamas would be in Rafa, and ordered the military
*  to draw up plans to evacuate it.
*  But Rafa is the southernmost city in the Gaza Strip, pinned between the Egyptian border
*  and the fighting further north, and it is not clear where the people sheltering there
*  would evacuate to.
*  Today, two Gazans on Life in Rafa.
*  It's Tuesday, February 20th.
*  Hi, is this Gada?
*  Yes.
*  Hi, Gada, this is Sabrina Tavernisi from the New York Times, from The Daily podcast.
*  Can you speak?
*  Yes, for sure.
*  Can you hear me well?
*  I can hear you well.
*  I can.
*  Okay.
*  Where am I speaking to you right now?
*  Where are you?
*  I'm in Rafa, Rafa city, south of Gaza Strip.
*  I hear somebody behind you.
*  Yeah, this is the family, actually.
*  Oh, who's in the family?
*  My sisters, my nieces, all of us like girls inside one home.
*  How many are you?
*  We are about like 20.
*  Oh, wow.
*  20.
*  Yeah.
*  Gada, can you identify yourself for me?
*  Tell me your name, your age, and your profession.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes, I'm Gada Al-Kurd.
*  Tomorrow will be my birthday, so I'll be 38 tomorrow.
*  Happy birthday.
*  Yes.
*  Thank you.
*  And I work as a freelancer journalist here in Gaza.
*  I used to work for international NGOs.
*  Yep, that's it.
*  So you say you're in Rafa, right?
*  Can you describe Rafa right now for us?
*  What does it look like?
*  What do you see around you when you go out onto the street?
*  Well, I was like about 10 minutes ago, I was out on the street.
*  I was going to provide the family here with some essentials and supplies, some food, some
*  maybe some chicken or meat because we are running out of these supplies.
*  Maybe some private essentials for me as a girl and for the girls here.
*  Private essentials for you as a woman, meaning tampons, supplies for when you have your period.
*  Yes.
*  Even we can hardly find these essentials.
*  You know it's overcrowded, like you cannot even walk in the streets.
*  You even have to tell the person in front of you or beside you just to move a little
*  bit, just to move a little bit.
*  Can I go through?
*  Yeah, it's very difficult for us to walk.
*  So this is the situation here.
*  People are living inside tents, lots of shelters you can see around you.
*  Schools are full of displaced people.
*  This is the situation here in Rafah city.
*  And did you find what you needed?
*  Not all of it actually.
*  For me, I was looking for a bag and I found something locally made by themselves and it
*  was bad quality.
*  But I have to buy it just to put my stuff inside if there is like another displacement
*  again.
*  So I have to buy it.
*  You've moved how many times in all?
*  This is the sixth time I think.
*  Yeah, it's very difficult.
*  Moving from city to a city and being in shelters, I didn't expect this.
*  Yeah.
*  On the morning of October 7th, Gada woke up in her apartment in Gaza City to the news
*  of the attack in Israel.
*  Everyone is like posting, what's going on?
*  What's going on?
*  What's going on?
*  No one knows at that time what's happening.
*  After maybe at 10, we know exactly what's happening.
*  And she immediately started making plans with her siblings.
*  And I had a brother and I told him, just wake up.
*  There is something dangerous is happening right now.
*  We need to think what we are going to do.
*  This war will be a disaster.
*  I said something in Arabic.
*  Like, we are going to eat shit.
*  We're going to eat shit.
*  Yes.
*  Like, the destruction will be more than you can ever imagine.
*  So then after one week of bombardment, of killings, of airstrikes, yeah, we realized
*  that I had to evacuate my home with my sister and I have to go to a Shifa hospital.
*  I spent three days there, living in front of a bathroom on the ground.
*  And actually, I hate hospitals.
*  So I went down and I was walking and I saw like they are bringing bodies in white bags.
*  They are just corpse.
*  And I smelled the blood and it was so disgusting.
*  Just to smell the blood.
*  The smell of this is around you.
*  You know?
*  I couldn't bear this situation and I want to go to another place.
*  So the day they announced that the evacuation to the south, I told my sister we have to
*  flee.
*  We have to go like it's...
*  The worst is coming.
*  And we ended up in a place in the middle area.
*  And after the one week that we spent in the middle area, we also evacuated to Khajouni
*  city.
*  And did you have enough supplies?
*  Clothes, food, water?
*  Was there something in particular that you wished you had had?
*  My daughters.
*  I'm sorry, say it again?
*  I have two daughters.
*  I'm a divorced woman.
*  And at that time, they were with their father.
*  And I told him like, can I take them with me?
*  He told me they will be safe with me.
*  You have too much work to do.
*  And you have also to take care of your father and your sisters.
*  They will be safe with me.
*  I'm the man.
*  They can be with me.
*  And we can like come after you.
*  But he couldn't.
*  So my daughters, they still in North Gaza.
*  Your daughters are still in North Gaza?
*  Yes.
*  Oh my goodness, Gaza.
*  I know.
*  That's why I don't want to leave Gaza.
*  Do you know if they're okay?
*  Yeah, they are okay.
*  Thank God.
*  I'm just checking up on them.
*  I'm trying to call their father.
*  But the connection is so bad.
*  How old are they, Gara?
*  So the older one, she will be on the 17th of February.
*  She will be 11.
*  And the youngest one, she will be next week.
*  She will be nine.
*  Oh, they're little.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  And you know now the hunger.
*  The hunger now and the famine in North of Gaza.
*  They don't have much food.
*  Actually, they are running out of food.
*  So I wish like the roads are open now.
*  Maybe I will be the first one to go back.
*  I will go.
*  I cannot bear all of this pain actually.
*  It's so hard for me to be away with them.
*  Yeah.
*  I want to be with them.
*  I want to.
*  And I know they are experiencing so much years and horrifying things.
*  But I want to be with them, hug them, love them, take care of them.
*  You know the situation.
*  Why haven't they evacuated, Gara?
*  Well, you know, even my sister, she didn't evacuate.
*  Another brother, he didn't evacuate.
*  My father, he didn't evacuate.
*  They didn't expect that it will be like this situation.
*  They got stuck.
*  Yeah.
*  And I have to tell you that I lost my brother with his wife and daughter in one of the airstrikes.
*  Yeah.
*  Also, my father, I lost him three weeks ago.
*  He died because like of hunger.
*  He couldn't have his diabetes medications.
*  And he has like a stroke, brain stroke.
*  So he even like he got injured in one of the airstrikes.
*  It was near the house he was in.
*  Yeah.
*  We lost him like three weeks ago.
*  I'm sorry, Gara.
*  Yeah.
*  And I have a little sister.
*  She's younger than me and she's pregnant.
*  Maybe this week she will deliver her baby.
*  And there is no hospitals over there.
*  And we managed to call her like three days ago and by video call finally.
*  And believe me, I didn't know her.
*  She was like an old woman.
*  Like her eyes have some dark circles.
*  She was very weak and very thin actually.
*  She doesn't look like she's pregnant.
*  She's a ninth month pregnant.
*  She told me like, I don't know how can I deliver my baby?
*  God, that must be very frightening for her.
*  For sure.
*  Yeah.
*  And she has also another child.
*  She's just maybe two and a half years.
*  Oh, wow.
*  So she's caring for a two-year-old as well.
*  Yes.
*  Gada, going back to your own story of evacuating.
*  So if I'm counting right, when did you get to Han Yunis?
*  You'd been on the road for about two weeks at that point, right?
*  Yeah.
*  And the first week is so hard for me.
*  The first week we have to build a tent for us
*  because the buildings inside the shelter, they were all very crowded.
*  So we prefer to build a tent.
*  So I'm living inside the tents.
*  It's not like a camping tent.
*  The first night we didn't take any covers, any blankets, anything with us.
*  So we had to put some nailons and plastics and woods to cover us.
*  And I remember one day I want to go to the bathroom.
*  I couldn't, and I have to wait for more than two hours in a line to go to bathroom.
*  So then I went to one of the buildings and there was a guard there.
*  And he told me, no, this is only for the worker who is working here.
*  I told him, I need to go to bathroom.
*  He told me, no, you can't.
*  I told him, I'm not talking about taking your heart or taking your eyes.
*  I'm asking to go to bathroom.
*  I opened the door and went and he was shouting on me.
*  I told him, I don't care.
*  I'm a human. I'm a woman.
*  And this is my right.
*  Yeah.
*  It's very humiliated actually.
*  You know, this is the horrible thing I can ever experience in my life.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  Like the air-stress, I cannot control it.
*  The shillings, I cannot control it.
*  But going to bathroom, I'm just feeling like...
*  I will argue, I will fight, I will do anything.
*  I cannot accept.
*  I understand.
*  Yeah.
*  Gadda, how long did you spend in Hunyounes?
*  Three months.
*  Three months in Hunyounes?
*  Yeah, from 20th of October till 20th of January.
*  And after that, we woke up early in the morning
*  and I found news they are coming close to the shelter.
*  So I went to the tent where I was living for three months
*  and I told my sister,
*  listen, you have to come with me, pack your luggage and we will go to Raffa.
*  Went out through the gates.
*  There was clashes behind us.
*  There was like bulldozers, Israeli bulldozers, Israeli tanks.
*  And they opened fire on people, even like sniping shots.
*  And it was like above our heads.
*  So I told her to run as much as she can.
*  And yes, we went like from the same way I came
*  and we directly moved to Raffa.
*  It become like night and we went through this road
*  and it was near to the border.
*  I saw the Egyptian side.
*  And I was seeing, you know, this is the line between Egypt and Gaza.
*  It was so painful for me to see that only like five meters,
*  like it's a wave, like five meters.
*  And this part is safe.
*  No earthquakes, nothing.
*  They are having their own country.
*  And there was light.
*  Actually, there were lots of lights.
*  And this was very painful for me.
*  To feel like you are living all the days inside the dark.
*  You are living inside darkness.
*  Yeah.
*  Does it make you angry at Egypt, given that it could theoretically
*  open the border, right?
*  Allow people into safety, into the light?
*  No.
*  Why should I be angry with them?
*  I mean, they could let people in, right?
*  But, okay, if I'm in your home and I came to your home,
*  this is your properties.
*  If I came without permission, would you allow for me?
*  Right.
*  I'm not defending them, but this is their own country.
*  Okay, we are under war, but at least we have the right to have our own state,
*  our own country.
*  So you're saying, basically, Egypt has the right not to let people in
*  because people living in Gaza aren't part of Egypt?
*  We are part of Palestine, okay?
*  We are not part of Egypt.
*  We are not fleeing to Egypt.
*  We are not going to live in Egypt.
*  We have our own country.
*  We want to be here.
*  Why should we live in another country?
*  If we want to spend a vacation there, okay, let's go to Egypt, all of us.
*  But this is our country.
*  We have to stay in our country.
*  As they live in their country, we have the right to live in our country.
*  Learn here, work here, build our country.
*  If we leave Gaza, who will stay here?
*  And what did you think when you saw that news about a potential invasion of Ra'afah?
*  I have no other place to go.
*  Honestly, I don't have any place.
*  This is the last place that I can evacuate to.
*  I don't have any other place to go.
*  I don't have all my friends' houses.
*  They are full of people, or my relatives even.
*  So I'm running out of places.
*  Yeah.
*  This is the last option that we have.
*  Does it feel a little bit like the end of things?
*  Like the end of what's happening?
*  The end of the war, maybe?
*  I hope so.
*  If it can be the end, I hope so.
*  But not with the ground invasion into Ra'afah.
*  Please stop.
*  Someone tell them not to do this.
*  I'm just expressing my feelings.
*  Gada, back in October when the war first started,
*  we spoke to a woman who was fleeing from the north.
*  And she said at some point in our conversation,
*  what do they want?
*  Why don't they just tell us what they want?
*  Do they want to just throw us into the sea?
*  Like, just be honest and don't keep us in all of this pain.
*  Tell us what you want to do with us.
*  Does that resonate with you at all?
*  Yeah, it's a game like we are playing a game.
*  Go there, hide there, don't go there.
*  It's not a safer place.
*  We are asking the same question again.
*  Tell us to stay in this place and don't come.
*  For me, you are fighting with a group, okay?
*  What is my fault?
*  It's not my fault.
*  Just avoid the civilians.
*  Just avoid us.
*  By that group, you mean Hamas?
*  Yes.
*  And what of the Israelis' contention that Hamas is in fact
*  hiding among civilians, that that is a tactic?
*  I know that you are going to say these questions.
*  I know.
*  I've been asked many times these questions.
*  But at least try to avoid us.
*  You are killing us.
*  Yeah.
*  We are following.
*  The people, the normal people, the civilians,
*  they are following their orders.
*  But whenever you are going to a safer place,
*  the fighting is following you.
*  That's the game you're talking about.
*  Yeah, it's a game.
*  You said it's a safer place,
*  then the next day you are attacking the safer place.
*  You said it's a safer place.
*  I'm not saying it's a safer place.
*  You said go there to avoid the civilians.
*  But you came to the safer place.
*  How can I believe you?
*  What to do?
*  But what will you do?
*  Will you try to run if you have to?
*  Would you?
*  Tell me where to run.
*  Tell me.
*  Just tell me where to go.
*  We'll be right back.
*  The Israeli military says it's rescued two of the hostages
*  abducted by Hamas during a raid in Rafah overnight.
*  Dozens of Palestinians were reported to have been killed
*  in the raid.
*  Dozens of Palestinians were reported to have been killed
*  in the early hours of Monday.
*  Israel's offensive in Rafah looks set to continue.
*  IDF appears poised to expand its ground war further south
*  where thousands of civilians have learned for safety.
*  Safe? What does the word even mean in Gaza today?
*  Actually, it's obvious that we are not dead
*  because what happened last night.
*  But there is no other place to go.
*  There is no other place to live.
*  We don't know what shall we do.
*  The day after an Israeli military raid into Rafah,
*  we talked to Hussein Aouda.
*  He'd been living in Rafah for about three weeks.
*  Starting from my house, the Nasr area at Gaza City,
*  to another neighborhood, another neighborhood,
*  another governor, another governor,
*  and finally here in Rafah.
*  Hussein had been displaced four times since the war began.
*  And in Rafah, he'd rented a house that was under construction
*  without windows or doors for his wife and three children to live in.
*  Actually, this is my kids next to me.
*  My eldest daughter, Ali, nine years old,
*  my son Mahmoud, six years old,
*  and then 16 months.
*  16 months old?
*  Yep.
*  Hussein, tell me, what are you doing for food now?
*  What are you eating?
*  Actually, we are suffering for every basic need.
*  For water, because each day you are going to fill the water.
*  You are going to carry gallons for the bathroom, for everything.
*  There is a huge lack of gas, cooking gas.
*  So people are depending on wood.
*  We're starting fire for cooking.
*  What do we cook, actually?
*  Actually, I get canned food, beans, canned meat, et cetera.
*  And all the people are just eating the canned food.
*  Actually, and the best thing we are facing from my perspective during the war,
*  actually, I lost around 30 kilos.
*  It's the only good thing that happened to me.
*  You lost 30 kilos. That's a lot of weight to lose.
*  Yeah, I needed to lose it, actually.
*  And it's the only good thing that happened to me.
*  Hussein?
*  Hi. My goodness, it's very difficult to get through.
*  Yes, thank God there is kind of connection right now,
*  even if it's very hard to call anyone.
*  Yes.
*  Basically, it's a challenge, actually.
*  It sounds like there's honking in the background, Hussein.
*  What is that? Where are you right now?
*  Actually, right now, I'm down on the street.
*  A lot of crowds here, you can imagine.
*  There is more than a million dead people out here in small cities
*  at the border with Egypt.
*  What does it look like?
*  It looks like it's going to be a lot more crowded.
*  What does it look like?
*  They are looking like not being alive.
*  It's indescribable, actually, because their faces don't show life.
*  They look like lost.
*  They are lost.
*  Thousands of people, all of them are lost on the street.
*  Are you lost?
*  Yes, for sure I'm lost, because I don't know what's going to happen.
*  I don't know what shall I do.
*  You know, it was a very scary night last night.
*  A lot of bombardment and shooting started, a lot of shooting.
*  We were asleep, actually, and all of us woke up due to the sound.
*  The house was shaking due to the bombing.
*  My son and daughter were screaming and asking me for hugging them and hiding them.
*  I just hugged them and found the most safe place, which is near the stairs.
*  We just sat in there, praying to be alive, to be safe.
*  All of us were scared to be shot or be bombed for no reason.
*  In the morning, I got to go outside to get some groceries for the house.
*  My daughter said to me, we don't need to eat, just to stay with us.
*  It's very dangerous to get outside, don't move.
*  I convinced her that I'm a big man, I can manage myself.
*  We got to eat and I'm going to be back.
*  Don't worry about me, just be alive here and listen to your mum.
*  Did you find food?
*  I went to a shelter next to our house and I found tomatoes, canned meat, spaghetti.
*  I went back to the home and did the spaghetti.
*  It was a very difficult task.
*  As Lynn told me, more than 50 people were killed in Lafay.
*  I'm thinking that it could be us any day.
*  We should live the best lives we can and enjoy every second and a minute as much as we can.
*  So I got to prepare something special for this.
*  So you got the spaghetti?
*  Yes.
*  Hussein, what was your life like before all of this started, before October 7th?
*  Tell me a little bit about you.
*  Actually, I was very busy.
*  I just finished building my house, which was supposed to move into on the 7th of October.
*  I bought the furniture and everything and it was to receive the furniture on 7th of October.
*  But I didn't receive the furniture and my new house is totally destroyed.
*  Actually, it took me around two years to finish it.
*  I got to design every corner.
*  I was my wife, what colors to use, what materials to use.
*  And actually, it was very beautiful.
*  We did a great kitchen, an open kitchen to the living room.
*  And we had a big balcony.
*  And we were thinking that this big balcony would be a place to sit in, drinking coffee and tea and eating fresh air.
*  Oh, that's not talking about that.
*  Sorry about that.
*  Sorry for that.
*  Are you okay?
*  Alhamdulillah, yeah, I'm fine.
*  What are you doing now? Where are you going to go?
*  I got a roof above me. I'm not in it.
*  But imagine the other people who are sleeping on the seats, sleeping on tents, sleeping by the seashore.
*  They got no toilets. They got no bathrooms.
*  And it's not a life for humans, actually.
*  A lot of diseases, a lot of manuication.
*  And the people are really suffering here. They are really suffering.
*  It's inhuman what we are living in.
*  And we did nothing. It's not our fault. We did nothing.
*  We are just normal people just trying to live our lives.
*  Why are we here? Why is this happening to us?
*  Sometimes I think my kids should be at school, should be studying.
*  Are they going to join schools again? There will be schools.
*  But they live a normal life.
*  You know, at the beginning I tried to convince my children that we are doing a kind of camping.
*  And my daughter just kept telling me that, no, it's not camping.
*  If it's camping, at least we should have living bags.
*  How is it going to be camping?
*  People do camping at the forest, but there is no forest.
*  We should start fire and we need marshmallows to do on fire.
*  And there is nothing to do. We are just living on the street. It's not camping.
*  Actually, I don't get the proper answer for her.
*  And I just said to her that you should enjoy your time with your family.
*  At least we are all together. And we are surviving.
*  It's kind of a special experience. We are living together and you should enjoy it.
*  Do you think they'll remember this, Hussein? Are you worried they'll remember this?
*  It's a scar in their memories. It won't disappear, actually.
*  Are you hopeful that your 16-month-old might not remember this?
*  Maybe he won't remember it, but I guess that he is going to leave its effect on his life.
*  Because while his family has no house, there is no proper life for him or for any child to live in.
*  There is nothing that can be done.
*  There is nothing to live in. There is nothing.
*  And actually, when I see the pictures and the videos of the other people that are used to live, it's totally destroyed.
*  So where is he going to live? It's not a proper place to live in.
*  And it will affect him, deeply affect him, living in such a situation.
*  Yeah.
*  It's their childhood. It's my life. It's our lives, which is stolen from us.
*  What does that feel like?
*  No power, nothing, no choices. We don't know what to do.
*  This doesn't declare any safe place to go to.
*  You know?
*  So we are just sitting here, waiting for our destiny.
*  I'm just going to go there, go there. We don't know. Maybe we are going to die. We are going to die. We don't know.
*  We are going to die. We are going to die.
*  We are going to die.
*  And he had her.
*  And he had her.
*  We are going to camp.
*  And there is no sleeping bag, tent.
*  Where is the tent?
*  Flashlight.
*  Flashlight? There is no light. We have to go to the flashlight.
*  No, to make the animals eat and the animals.
*  There is no flashlight.
*  Hmm.
*  There is no light.
*  There is nothing to do.
*  I just remember the silly questions we used to play in our childhood.
*  Who will you choose to serve?
*  We never imagined that we can be in a real situation where we got to choose.
*  Unfortunately, I can't serve anyone.
*  I only can try to serve one, two, three at maximum.
*  Now I'm thinking about evacuating my kids to save them from the hell we are living in.
*  A day after we spoke to Hussein, he sent a voice memo saying that he was trying to decide whether to get his family out of Gaza, through Egypt.
*  The border is officially closed, but Gazans say that with enough money you can get people out.
*  Evacuating one person from Gaza costs around $5,000.
*  Actually, it's very hard to decide.
*  I cannot make a decision to try to evacuate my kids so they can be safe, they can go to school, but they are going to be far away from me.
*  Which I don't know if I can handle.
*  All of us just can stay here together facing the same destiny.
*  It's really hard to take a decision.
*  It's so difficult.
*  Would you do that?
*  I don't think so.
*  Why? Why would you not leave?
*  First of all, because of my daughter.
*  I'm so attached to this land, actually. I love Gaza.
*  But even to save your own life?
*  My daughter's life is more important than my life.
*  I will not be comfortable outside Gaza.
*  On Sunday, Hussein made his decision.
*  He said he paid to get his wife and children across the border.
*  But he said he stayed behind to take care of his elderly parents and to pay back the money he borrowed to get his family to safety.
*  Gada remains in Rafa.
*  And over the weekend, Netanyahu said that negotiations over a ceasefire and a potential hostage release with Hamas had reached an impasse.
*  And that his government was pushing ahead with plans for an invasion of Rafa, despite international pressure to call it off.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  I will continue to do what Alexei Navalny did.
