*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverny C, and this is the daily.
*  In four months of war, Israel has regularly warned residents of the Gaza Strip to move
*  south for safety.
*  As a result, more than a million gauzeons about half the population of the entire enclave
*  have ended up in the city of Rafa.
*  Now, as the war enters its fifth month, Prime Minister Benjamin Nenyaahu has said that
*  the next phase of Israel's fight against Hamas would be in Rafa and ordered the military
*  to draw plans to evacuate it.
*  But Rafa is the southernmost city in the Gaza Strip, pinned between the Egyptian border
*  and the fighting further north, and it is not clear where the people sheltering there
*  would evacuate too.
*  Today, two gauzons on life in Rafa.
*  It's Tuesday, February 20th.
*  So, hi, is this Gada?
*  Yes.
*  Hi, Gada.
*  This is Sabrina Taverny C from the New York Times from the Daily Podcast.
*  Can you speak?
*  Yes, for sure.
*  Can you hear me well?
*  I can hear you well.
*  I can.
*  Okay.
*  Where am I speaking to you right now?
*  Where are you?
*  I'm Amir Rafa, Rafa City, south of Gaza Strip.
*  I hear somebody behind you.
*  Yeah, this is the family, actually.
*  Oh.
*  Who's in the family?
*  Yeah.
*  My sister's my niece is all of us like girls inside one home.
*  How many are you?
*  We are about like 20.
*  Oh, wow.
*  20.
*  Yeah.
*  Gada, can you identify yourself for me?
*  Tell me your name, your age and your profession?
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  I'm Radha Al-Qaeda.
*  Tomorrow will be my birthday.
*  So, I'll be 38 tomorrow.
*  Happy birthday.
*  Yes.
*  Thank you.
*  And work as freelancer journalist here in Gaza.
*  I used to work for international NGOs.
*  Yep.
*  That's it.
*  So, you say you're in Rafa, right?
*  You describe Rafa right now for us.
*  What does it look like?
*  What do you see around you when you go out onto the street?
*  Oh, well, I was like about 10 minutes ago.
*  I was out on the street.
*  I was going to provide the family here with some essentials and supplies.
*  Some food, some maybe some chicken or meat,
*  because we are running out of these supplies.
*  Maybe some private essentials for me as a girl,
*  and for the girls here.
*  Private essentials for you as a woman,
*  meaning tampons, supplies for when you have your period.
*  Yes.
*  Even we can hardly find these essentials.
*  And you know, it's overcrowded.
*  Like, you cannot even walk in the streets.
*  You even have to tell the person in front of you or beside you
*  just to move a little bit, just to move a little bit.
*  Can I go through?
*  Yeah, it's very difficult for us to walk.
*  So, this is the situation here.
*  People are living inside tents.
*  Lots of shelters you can see around you.
*  Schools are full of displaced people.
*  Yeah, this is the situation here in Rafa city.
*  And did you find what you needed?
*  Not all of it, actually.
*  For me, I was looking for a bag.
*  And I found something local, they made it by themselves.
*  And it was bad quality.
*  But I have to buy it just to put my stuff inside.
*  There is like another displacement again.
*  So, I have to buy it.
*  You've moved how many times, you know?
*  This is the sixth time, I think.
*  Yeah, it's very difficult.
*  Moving from city to a city and being in shelters,
*  I didn't expect this.
*  Yeah.
*  On the morning of October 7th,
*  Gata woke up in her apartment in Gaza City
*  to the news of the attack in Israel.
*  Everyone is like, what's going on?
*  What's going on? What's going on?
*  No one knows at that time what's happening.
*  After maybe 10, we know exactly what's happening.
*  And she immediately started making play-ons with her siblings.
*  And I had brother and I told him just wake up.
*  There is something dangerous is happening right now.
*  We need to think what we are going to do.
*  This war will be a disaster.
*  I said something in Arabic.
*  It's like we are going to eat shit.
*  We are going to eat shit.
*  Yes.
*  Like the destruction will be more than you can ever imagine.
*  So then, after one week of bombardment,
*  of shillings, of air strikes,
*  we realized that I had to evacuate my home with my sister.
*  And I have to go to a shifa hospital.
*  I spent three days there,
*  leaving in front of the bathroom on the ground.
*  And I actually, I hate hospitals.
*  So I went down and I was walking.
*  And I saw like they are bringing bodies in white bags.
*  They are just corpse.
*  Yeah.
*  And I smelled the blood.
*  And it was so disgusting.
*  Just to smell the blood,
*  it's smell of this is around you.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't beer this situation.
*  And I want to go to another place.
*  So the day they announced that the evacuation to the south,
*  I told my sister we have to flee.
*  We have to go like it's, the worst is coming.
*  And we ended up in a place in the middle area.
*  And after the one week that we spent in the middle area,
*  we also evacuated to Hanyun city.
*  And did you have enough supplies, clothes, food, water?
*  Was there something in particular that you wished you had had?
*  My daughter's, I'm sorry, say it again.
*  I have two daughters.
*  I'm a divorced woman.
*  And at that time they were with their father.
*  And I told him, like, can I take them with me?
*  He told me they will be safe with me.
*  You have too much work to do.
*  And you have also to take care of your father and your sisters.
*  They will be safe with me.
*  I'm the man.
*  They can be with me.
*  And we can like come after you, but he couldn't.
*  So my daughters, they still in North Gaza.
*  Your daughters are still in North Gaza?
*  Yes.
*  Oh my goodness, God.
*  I know.
*  That's why I don't want to leave Gaza.
*  Do you know if they're OK?
*  Yeah, they are OK.
*  Thank God.
*  I'm just checking up on them trying to call their father.
*  But the connection is so bad.
*  How old are they, Gara?
*  So the older ones, she will be on the 17th of February.
*  She will be 11.
*  And the youngest ones, she will be next week.
*  She will be 9.
*  Oh, they're little.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  And you know now the hunger.
*  The hunger now and the famine in North Gaza.
*  They don't have much food.
*  Actually, they are running a food.
*  So I was like, the roads are open now.
*  Maybe I will the first one to go back.
*  I will go.
*  I cannot fear all of this pain.
*  Actually, it's so hard for me to be away with them.
*  Yeah.
*  I want to be with them.
*  I want to, and I know the arcs,
*  experience so much years and horror thing, things.
*  But I want to be with them, hug them, love them, take care of them.
*  But you know, the situation.
*  Why haven't they evacuated, Gara?
*  Well, even my sister, she didn't evacuate.
*  Another brother, he didn't evacuate.
*  My father, he didn't evacuate.
*  They didn't expect that it will be like this situation.
*  They got stuck.
*  Yeah.
*  And I have to tell you that I lost my brother with his wife and daughter,
*  and one of the airstrikes.
*  Yeah.
*  Also, my father, I lost him three weeks ago.
*  He died because of hunger.
*  He couldn't have his diabetes medications.
*  And he has like a stroke brain stroke.
*  So he even like he got injured in one of the airstrikes.
*  It was near the house he was in.
*  Yeah.
*  We lost him like three weeks ago.
*  I'm sorry, Gara.
*  Yeah.
*  And I have a little sister.
*  She's younger than me and she's a pregnant.
*  Maybe this week she will deliver her baby.
*  And there is no hospitals over there.
*  And we managed to call her like three days ago and by video call finally.
*  And believe me, I didn't know her.
*  She was like an old woman, like her eyes have some dark fur kills.
*  She was very weak and very thin actually.
*  She doesn't look like she's a pregnant.
*  She's a nine month pregnant.
*  She told me like, I don't know how can I deliver my baby.
*  God, that must be very frightening for her.
*  So sure, yeah.
*  And she has also another child.
*  He's just too unhappy.
*  Oh, wow.
*  So she's caring for a two year old as well.
*  Yes.
*  Gara, going back to your own story of evacuating.
*  So if I'm counting right, when did you get to Han Unis?
*  You'd been on the road for about two weeks at that point, right?
*  Yeah.
*  And the first week is so hard for me.
*  The first week we have to build a tent for us
*  because of the buildings inside the shelter.
*  They were all very crowded.
*  So we'd be prepared to build a tent.
*  So I'm living inside that tent.
*  It's not like a camping tent.
*  At the first night, we didn't take any covers and a blanket
*  and we think with us.
*  So we had to put some nailons and plastics and wood to cover us.
*  And I remember one day I want to go to bathroom.
*  I couldn't.
*  And I had to wait for more than two hours in the line
*  to go to bathroom.
*  So then I went to one of the buildings
*  and there was a girl there.
*  And they told me, no, this is only for the worker
*  who was working here.
*  I told him, I need to go to bathroom.
*  He told me, no, you can't.
*  I told him, I'm not talking about taking your heart
*  or shaking your eyes.
*  I'm asking to go to bathroom.
*  I opened the door and went and he was shouting on me.
*  I told him, I don't care.
*  I'm a human.
*  I'm a woman.
*  And this is my right.
*  Yeah.
*  Very normal.
*  It actually, you know, this is the horrible thing
*  I can ever experience in my life.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  Like, the source, I cannot control it.
*  The shillings I cannot control it.
*  But in going to bathroom, I'm just feeling like...
*  I will argue, I will fight, I will do anything.
*  I cannot accept.
*  I understand.
*  Yeah.
*  God, how long did you spend in Hone Unis?
*  Three months.
*  Three months in Hone Unis.
*  Yeah, from 20 of October till the 20 of January.
*  And after that, we woke up early in the morning
*  and I found news they are coming close to the shelter.
*  So I went to the tent where I was living for three months
*  and I told my sister, listen, you have to come with me
*  back your luggage and we will go to Rafa.
*  Went out through the gates.
*  There was a clashes behind us.
*  There was like bulldozers, Israeli bulldozers, Israeli tanks.
*  And they opened fire on people, even like sniping shots.
*  And it was like above our heads.
*  So I told her to run as much as she can.
*  And yes, we went like from the same way I came
*  and we directly moved to Rafa.
*  It became like night and we went through this road
*  and it was near to the border.
*  I saw the Egyptian side.
*  And I was seeing, you know, this is the line
*  between Egypt and Gaza.
*  It was so beautiful for me to see that only like five meters
*  like it's a wave, like five meters.
*  And this part is safe.
*  No earthquakes, nothing.
*  They are having their own country.
*  And there was light.
*  Actually, there were lots of lights.
*  And this was very painful for me to feel like you are living
*  all the days inside the dark.
*  You are living inside darkness.
*  Yeah.
*  Does it make you angry at Egypt?
*  Given that it could theoretically open the border, right?
*  Allow people into safety into the light.
*  No.
*  Why should I be angry?
*  I mean, they could let people in, right?
*  But OK, if I'm in your home and I can't to your home,
*  this is your own priorities.
*  If I came without permission, would you allow for me?
*  Right.
*  I'm not defending them, but this is their own country.
*  OK, we are under war, but at least we have the right
*  to have our own state, our own country.
*  So you're saying basically, Egypt has the right not
*  to let people in because people living in Gaza
*  aren't part of Egypt.
*  We are part of Palestine.
*  OK, we are not part of Egypt.
*  We are not to flank.
*  We are not going to live in Egypt.
*  We have our own country.
*  We want to be in the here.
*  Why should we live to another country?
*  If we want to spend the vacation there, OK, let's go to Egypt, all of us.
*  But this is our country.
*  We have to stay in our country.
*  As they live in their country, we have the right to live in our country.
*  Learn here, work here, build our country.
*  We live Gaza.
*  How will I stay here?
*  And what did you think when you saw that news
*  about a potential invasion of Rafa?
*  I have no other place to go.
*  Honestly, I don't have any place.
*  This is the last place that I can evacuate to.
*  I don't have any other place to go.
*  Like I don't have all my friends, houses.
*  They are full of people or my relatives even.
*  So I'm running out of places.
*  Yeah.
*  This is the last option that we have.
*  Does it feel a little bit like the end of things,
*  like the end of what's happening, the end of the war, maybe?
*  I hope so.
*  If it can be the end, I hope so.
*  But not with the ground invasion to Rafa, please stop.
*  I mean, so I won't tell them to not to do this.
*  I'm just like, I'm experiencing my feeling.
*  God, the back in October when the war first started,
*  we spoke to a woman who was fleeing from the North.
*  And she said at some point in our conversation,
*  what do they want?
*  Why don't they just tell us what they want?
*  Do they want to just throw us into the sea?
*  Like, just be honest and don't keep us in all of this pain.
*  Tell us what you want to do with us.
*  Does that resonate with you at all?
*  Yeah, it's a game like what are playing a game.
*  Go there, hide there, don't go there.
*  It's not a safe place.
*  We are asking the same question again.
*  Like, tell us to stay in this place and don't come.
*  For me, you are fighting with a group, okay?
*  What is my fault?
*  It's not my fault.
*  Just avoid that civilians.
*  Just avoid us.
*  By that group, you mean Hamas?
*  Yes.
*  And what if I think is with them?
*  And what if the Israeli's contention that Hamas is in fact hiding
*  among civilians that that is a tactic?
*  I know that you are going to say this question.
*  I know.
*  I've been asked like many times this question.
*  But at least try to avoid us.
*  You are killing us.
*  Yeah.
*  We are following like the people, the normal people,
*  the civilians, they are following.
*  They are orders.
*  But whenever you are going to a safe place,
*  the fighting is following you.
*  That's the game you're talking about.
*  Yeah, it's a game like it's a game.
*  You said it's a safe place.
*  Then next day you are attacking the safe place.
*  You said it's a safe place.
*  I'm not saying it's a safe place.
*  You said go there to avoid the civilians.
*  But you came to the safe place.
*  How can I believe you?
*  What to do?
*  But what will you do?
*  Will you try to run if you have to?
*  Would you?
*  Tell me where to run.
*  Tell me.
*  Just tell me where to go.
*  We'll be right back.
*  The Israeli military says it's rescued two of the hostages
*  abducted by Hamas during a raid in Rafa overnight.
*  Dozens of Palestinians were reported to have been killed
*  in the any hours of Monday.
*  Israel's offensive in Rafa looks set to continue.
*  IDF appears poised to expand its ground war further south
*  with thousands of civilians have led to safety.
*  Safe.
*  What does it even mean in Gaza's day?
*  Actually, it's obvious that the honor did
*  cause what happened lost my battery's not a place to go.
*  There is no other place to leave.
*  We don't know what shall we do.
*  The day after an Israeli military raid into Rafa,
*  we talked to Hussein Aoda.
*  He'd been living in Rafa for about three weeks.
*  Starting from my house, the Nasr area at Gaza City,
*  to Anada Nebarhud, Anada Nebarhud, and Anada Gawarnud,
*  to Anada Gawarnud and finally here in Rafa.
*  Hussein had been displaced four times since the war began.
*  And in Rafa, he'd rented a house that was under construction
*  without windows or doors for his wife and three children to live in.
*  Actually, this is my kids next to me.
*  My daughter, I've been in the Uzold, my son,
*  my mother, six years old, and she's in 16 months.
*  16 months old?
*  Yep.
*  Oh.
*  Hussein, tell me, what are you doing for food now?
*  What are you eating?
*  Actually, we are suffering for every basic need for water.
*  Because each day, you are going to fill the water.
*  You are going to carry kind of gallons for bathroom for everything.
*  There is a huge lack of gas, cooking gas.
*  So people are depending on what.
*  Starting fire for cooking.
*  What do the cook actually?
*  Actually, I get canned food.
*  Peens, canned meat, etc.
*  And all the people are just eating the canned food.
*  Actually, and the best thing we are facing from my perspective during the war,
*  actually, I lost around 30 kilos.
*  It's the only good thing happened to me.
*  You lost 30 kilos.
*  That's a lot of way to lose.
*  Yeah, I needed to lose it, actually.
*  And it's not only good thing happened to me.
*  Hussein?
*  Hi, my goodness.
*  It's very difficult to get through.
*  Yes, thank God there is kind of connection right now.
*  Even if it's very hard to pull anyone.
*  Yes.
*  If you basically
*  is the challenge, actually.
*  It sounds like there's honking in the background, Hussein.
*  What is that? Where are you right now?
*  Actually, right now I'm down on the street.
*  A lot of clouds see people imagine there is more than millions of people are here.
*  And it's mostly here.
*  At the border it would be.
*  What does it look like?
*  It's dark.
*  And a lot of clouds of people just walking, trying to find food, time, water,
*  just walking around us.
*  With no direction, with no destination for them.
*  Actually, I see that people like to don't be
*  walking on the street.
*  They are walking in a hopeless way.
*  They are looking like not being alive.
*  It's on the driver's level, actually, because
*  their taste is doesn't show life.
*  They look like just.
*  Is it unloved?
*  Thousands of people, all of them are lost on the street.
*  Are you lost?
*  You're for sure unloved.
*  Because I don't know what's going to happen.
*  I don't know what Shailai do.
*  You know, it was a very scary night last night.
*  A lot of bombardment and shillings started.
*  A lot of shooting.
*  We were asleep, actually.
*  And all of us woke up,
*  due to the sound the house was shaking due to the moment.
*  And my tongue and her tongue were screaming and
*  popping me for hugging them and hiding them.
*  And I just hugged them and found the most safe place, which is near the fair.
*  And we just fell into the air,
*  gained to be allowed to be safe.
*  And all of us were scared to be caught or be bombed for no reason.
*  At the morning, I got to go outside to get kind of a rosary for the house.
*  And my daughter said to me, we don't need to eat.
*  Just to stay with us.
*  It's very dangerous to get outside.
*  Don't move.
*  And I convinced here that I'm a big man.
*  I can manage my self-hide.
*  And we got to eat.
*  And I'm going to be back.
*  Don't worry about me.
*  Just to apologize here.
*  And listen to your mom.
*  Yeah.
*  And did you find food?
*  Yeah, I went to I shouldn't have next door.
*  And I found tomato.
*  I both can't meet.
*  I bought the spaghetti.
*  And went back to the home and did the dishes.
*  Because it was a very difficult night.
*  I couldn't tell me that everywhere, more than 60 people are killed in the last night.
*  So I'm thinking that it could be off any day.
*  We should live the best lives we can.
*  And enjoy every second and a minute as much as we can.
*  So I got to prepare something special for them.
*  So you got the spaghetti?
*  Yeah.
*  Hussein, what was your life like before all of this started before October 7th?
*  Tell me a little bit about you.
*  Actually, I was very busy.
*  I just finished bending my house, which was supposed to move into
*  on the servants of October.
*  Oh wow.
*  Both the furniture and everything.
*  And it was to receive the furniture on the servants of October.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  But I didn't receive the furniture.
*  And my new house is totally destroyed.
*  Actually, it took me around two years to finish it.
*  I got to design every corner with my wife.
*  What color to use, what materials to use.
*  And actually, it was very beautiful actually.
*  We did a great kitchen and open kitchen to the living room.
*  And we had a big balcony.
*  We were thinking that this big balcony would be a place
*  to sit in, drinking coffee and tea and living fresh air.
*  Oh.
*  It's not so clean about that.
*  It's so clean.
*  Oh.
*  What is that?
*  Are you okay?
*  What are you doing now?
*  Where are you going to go?
*  I'm not talking about now.
*  Like a room, baby.
*  So,
*  I got that it's dark.
*  No one can see the tees on my eyes.
*  Actually for me at least I got money.
*  I can buy food.
*  I got a roof above me.
*  I'm not getting it in.
*  Yeah.
*  But I mentioned other people who are sleeping with the feet,
*  sleeping on tents,
*  sleeping by the feet, who are here,
*  they got no toilet, they got no bathrooms.
*  And it's not alive for humans actually.
*  I love to see the video,
*  a lot of my new kitchen.
*  And the people are really suffering here.
*  They are really suffering.
*  It's in the human what you are living in.
*  And we did nothing.
*  It's not our fault.
*  We did nothing.
*  We are just normal people just trying to live our lives.
*  Why are we here?
*  Why is this happening to us?
*  Sometimes I think my kids should be at school,
*  should we study?
*  I think I'm enjoying schools again.
*  They will be schools.
*  But they will be there till it's normal life.
*  You know, as a beginning I tried to convince my children
*  that we are doing the kind of camping.
*  And my daughter just kept to kill me.
*  They had no, it's not camping.
*  If it's camping, at least we should have living there.
*  How is it going to be camping?
*  People do camping at the forest.
*  But there is no forest.
*  We should start fire and we need marshmallows to do on fire.
*  And there is nothing to do.
*  We are just living on the street.
*  It's not camping.
*  Actually, I don't get the proper answer for her.
*  And I just say to her that you should enjoy your time with your family.
*  At least we are all together.
*  And you are all so happy.
*  Yeah.
*  It's kind of special experience we are living together
*  and you should enjoy it.
*  Do you think they'll remember this?
*  Who's saying?
*  Are you worried they'll remember this?
*  It's a scar in their memories.
*  I don't want this at the end.
*  Are you hopeful that your 16-month-old might not remember this?
*  I hope so.
*  Maybe you won't remember it.
*  But I guess that he is going to live with his life.
*  Because why his family got no house?
*  So there is no proper life.
*  For him, no for any child to live in.
*  There is nothing.
*  And actually, when I see the pictures and the videos
*  that we used to live, it's totally destroyed.
*  So, what is he going to live?
*  It's not a proper place to live in.
*  And it will affect him,
*  deeply, I think, him living in such a situation.
*  Yeah.
*  It's very childhood.
*  It's my life.
*  It's our lives.
*  Which is joining us from us.
*  What does that feel like?
*  No power.
*  Nothing.
*  No forces.
*  We don't know what to do.
*  This isn't declared any safe place to go to.
*  So, we are just sitting here waiting for our destiny.
*  I'm just good, good, good, good, good, good.
*  You know, we don't know.
*  We don't know.
*  We don't know.
*  We are just being.
*  We are getting a job.
*  We don't know.
*  We are doing that.
*  We are getting a job.
*  So, we are having large lives.
*  And then, the number one.
*  Yes.
*  Yes, that's the Garden, there's World Loach Garden
*  that you stand in.
*  Yes.
*  World Loach Garden, there's World Loach Garden Campus.
*  I do feel so sad.
*  You can't?
*  Flash, Flash, Flash.
*  Flash, Flash, Flash, Flash.
*  I'm not going to throw my hands away from you.
*  Flash, Flash, Flash.
*  Flash, Flash, Flash.
*  Flash, Flash, Flash.
*  I just remember the select questions we used to play in a childhood.
*  Who will you choose to save?
*  We never imagined that we can be in a real situation where we got to choose.
*  Unfortunately, I can't save anyone.
*  I only can't fly to save one to flee at maximum.
*  But now I'm thinking about evacuating my kids to save them from the hell we are living in.
*  A day after we spoke to Hussein, he sent a voice memo saying that he was trying to decide whether to get his family out of Gaza through Egypt.
*  The border is officially closed.
*  But Gaza says that with enough money, you can get people out.
*  If evacuating one person from Gaza cost around $5,000.
*  I'm sorry.
*  It's really hard to decide.
*  I cannot make a decision to try to evacuate my kids so they can be safe.
*  They can go to schools.
*  But they are going to be far away from me.
*  Which I don't know if I can handle it.
*  Or all of us just can stay here together facing the same destiny.
*  I'm really hard to take a decision.
*  That's so difficult.
*  Would you do that?
*  I don't think so.
*  Why? Why would you not leave?
*  First of all, because of my daughter.
*  And then I'm so attached to this land.
*  Actually, I love Gaza.
*  But even to save your own life.
*  My daughter's life is more important than my life.
*  Yeah.
*  I will not be comfortable outside Gaza.
*  On Sunday, Hussein made his decision.
*  He said he paid to get his wife and children across the border.
*  But he said he stayed behind to take care of his elderly parents
*  and to pay back the money he borrowed to get his family to safety.
*  Gaza remains in Rafa.
*  And over the weekend, Netanyahu said that negotiations over a ceasefire
*  and a potential hostage release with Hamas had reached an impasse.
*  And that his government was pushing ahead with plans for an invasion of Rafa,
*  despite international pressure to call it off.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what I'll teach you today.
*  On Monday, the widow of Alexey Navalny,
*  the Russian opposition leader who died in a Russian prison on Friday,
*  appeared on her husband's YouTube channel for the first time,
*  pledging in a fiercely emotional tone to continue the fight that her husband began.
*  I'm sorry to share my identity.
*  Julian Navalny, who is 47, and had long shunned the spotlight,
*  urged her husband's followers to take action, however small,
*  against the regime of Vladimir Putin, saying,
*  I ask you to share my rage, anger, and hatred of those who have dared to kill our future.
*  She said that the best way to honor her husband's legacy was to fight more desperately and furiously than before.
*  Meanwhile, the Russian authorities are refusing to release Navalny's body to his mother
*  in a remote Arctic town close to the prison where he died.
*  They told her that her son's body would be subject to a, quote,
*  chemical examination for the next 14 days.
