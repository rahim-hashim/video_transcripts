*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavredy-C, and this is The Daily.
*  A critical gun case was argued before the Supreme Court this week, one of the few in modern
*  history.
*  But instead of opening further freedoms for gun owners, the court, with its conservative
*  supermajority, seemed ready to set a limit.
*  Today, my colleague Adam Littac explains.
*  It's Thursday, November 9.
*  So Adam, we've just had oral arguments in a very important gun case. And you previewed
*  it for us in October, and it was going to be one of those tests of just how far to
*  the right this court was going to go.
*  So I've been watching your reporting, saw the case come up, and I wanted to give listeners
*  a real sense of what the answer to that question might be.
*  So let's dig into it.
*  Remind us why this case is so important.
*  So this case is important on two levels.
*  First level, very important, second level, even more important.
*  The very important question the court is looking at is, can the government make it a crime
*  for someone to have a gun if they're the subject of a domestic violence restraining order?
*  The presence of firearms combined with domestic strife is a recipe for lethal violence.
*  So the answer to that question, very important.
*  Even more important though, is the way the court is going to approach that question,
*  because not long ago in 2022, it announced a new second amendment standard by which
*  to judge all kinds of gun control measures, one that is rooted in history.
*  Right. And this is of course the brewing decision, which we've talked about a bunch
*  on the show, this kind of revolutionary decision that really threw all of the cards up in
*  here, because this historical requirement seemed to make it much harder to put new limits
*  on guns. So it was really a big win potentially for gun rights advocates.
*  It sure looked that way.
*  What the court told us last year is that in judging whether a gun control measure is
*  constitutional or not, courts are supposed to look at the founding era and see if there
*  were analogous restrictions back then, whether in the 1700s, there were regulations that
*  addressed, say, domestic violence or whatever.
*  And the court said, it doesn't have to be a perfect match, but it has to be analogous.
*  And that even as I say it, it's hard to put your finger on exactly what that means.
*  So using that historical test has caused both confusion and a mountain of work for the
*  lower court judges who are not historians, who are met now to find parchment documents
*  written in Quill Pen that may or may not match up with some contemporary law.
*  It's what one judge called a game of historical, where's Waldo trying to find restrictions
*  that more or less match up to contemporary restrictions.
*  And just in the year after Bruin, courts have more than two dozen times struck down gun
*  control laws because they couldn't find historical analogies.
*  Right.
*  Okay. So that's the landscape that the courts have been navigating for the past year.
*  A big effect with this new standard, which brings us to the case argued this week.
*  I remember when we last talked about it, the guy at the center of the case was pretty
*  unsympathetic, remind us of the details.
*  So the case is called United States versus Rahimi.
*  It concerns a young man named Zaki Rahimi, who a few years ago physically assaulted his
*  girlfriend.
*  She seeks a restraining order.
*  A judge grants the restraining order saying that Rahimi is likely to commit violence again.
*  And that restraining order also tells him that he can't have guns.
*  And if he is found possessing a gun, that would be a federal crime.
*  But that doesn't stop Rahimi from committing a string of gun crimes.
*  In one case, he takes a shot at a fellow driver in a road rage incident.
*  In another, after someone is talking trash about him in social media, as he put it, he
*  shoots a gun into that person's house.
*  After a friend's credit card was declined at a what a burger, fast-trude restaurant,
*  he takes out a gun and fires several shots into the air.
*  Luckily nobody was killed during these incidents.
*  But Zaki Rahimi was a one man crime spree.
*  And so these incidents draw the attention of law enforcement.
*  The authorities search his home.
*  They find guns.
*  They find a copy of the restraining order that says he can't have guns.
*  And he's charged with the federal crime of possessing guns while being subject to domestic
*  violence restraining order.
*  And he's convicted.
*  And he gets a pretty stiff prison sentence.
*  So he challenges that ruling in federal court.
*  And gun rights groups do not love this because he's the least sympathetic possible protagonist
*  in a second amendment case.
*  And the lower courts initially ruled against Rahimi said he could be prosecuted.
*  So he loses in a district court.
*  He loses in the appeal court.
*  But then brewing happens.
*  Rahimi goes back to the appeal court.
*  And the appeal court under brewing takes a fresh look at his question and concludes
*  wait a second.
*  We can't find a historical analog that closely matches up to domestic violence.
*  And therefore they rule for Rahimi and they strike down the law as unconstitutional.
*  Okay, so this is a clear example of the legal earthquake we were talking about, right?
*  Like the historical standard was actually used to overturn the law that Rahimi had been
*  jailed under.
*  Right.
*  So the Biden administration takes the case to the Supreme Court.
*  They're probably delighted in one sense that they have such a sympathetic case to take
*  to the court.
*  And the justice has accept the case as they almost always do when a lower court has struck
*  down a federal law.
*  I think the justices think that if anyone's going to be striking down federal laws is unconstitutional,
*  it ought to be the Supreme Court and not lower courts.
*  Okay, so that's how the case shot up to the Supreme Court and that brings us to the oral
*  arguments that you heard this week.
*  So you were there, Adam.
*  Tell me how they began.
*  So the Biden administration took the case to the court and they get to go first.
*  General Prologueur.
*  Mr Chief Justice and may it please the court.
*  Guns and domestic abuse are a deadly combination.
*  They're represented by Elizabeth Prelogue, the solicitor general of the United States,
*  the Justice Department official whose job it is to argue cases before the Supreme Court.
*  And she talks to the justices very much in the language of Bruin, in the language of
*  history.
*  Like heller and McDonald, Bruin recognized that Congress made to charm those who are
*  not law-abiding responsible citizens.
*  That principle is firmly grounded in the Second Amendment's history and tradition.
*  Throughout our nation's history.
*  She draws on earlier Supreme Court decisions which have used a phrase that says the Second
*  Amendment protects law-abiding and responsible citizens and gives them a right to keep
*  in their arms.
*  And she bears down on that phrase.
*  This case focuses on the not responsible citizens principle and in this class.
*  She says she's not focused in this case on law-abiding, but she is focused on responsible.
*  And initially there's some resistance to that, particularly from the Chief Justice.
*  Responsibility is a very broad concept.
*  I mean, not taking your recycling to the curb on Thursdays.
*  I mean, if you're-
*  He thinks that responsible is too vague a phrase.
*  He says, well, what if I don't take out the recycling?
*  I suppose I'm not responsible.
*  What if I get in a fight at a ballgame?
*  I suppose I'm not responsible.
*  What seems responsible to some irresponsible, to some people might seem like, well, that's
*  not a big deal to others.
*  So what is the model?
*  She says,
*  So I want to be really clear that we're not using the term not responsible to describe colloquially
*  anyone who you might describe as as demonstrating irresponsibility in many of those contexts
*  that you just described in your hypotheticals.
*  It's actually kind of a term of art.
*  And intrinsically tied to the danger you would present if you have access to firearms.
*  And I would draw a draw.
*  It's actually a way of talking about whether people are dangerous or not.
*  Responsible people are not dangerous people.
*  And if you can show that someone is dangerous, there are general laws from the founding
*  era that allow the government to disarm people who are dangerous.
*  And that seems to get a lot of tracks.
*  I mean, I think there would be little dispute that someone who was guilty, say, or even had
*  a restraining order, the domestic violence is dangerous.
*  Okay.
*  So someone who poses a risk of domestic violence is dangerous.
*  So in other words, to bring this back to the historical standards set by Bruin, rather
*  than finding some exact one-to-one law on the books about domestic violence from way
*  back when, pre-logger is basically saying it was clear that there were laws stating the
*  general principle that dangerous people should not have guns.
*  And we can apply that principle to domestic violence cases in the present day.
*  Right.
*  To rely on founding era laws, but at a high level of generality.
*  So they're not talking about domestic violence as such, but they're talking about you can
*  disarm dangerous individuals.
*  And that mode of argument by pre-logger seemed to really work with most of the conservative
*  justices.
*  Do you think the level of generality, I take your point, you've got surety laws, you've
*  got a fray laws, you've got a lot of historical evidence?
*  Because they could rule in favor of the law and against Rahimi without doing damage to
*  their general project of making the Second Amendment be a subject of a history test.
*  Okay, so interestingly, some of the conservative justices are coming around on the case, but
*  what about Clarence Thomas, who's of course the most conservative justices and actually
*  wrote the majority opinion on Bruin?
*  So Sabrina, Clarence Thomas, and to a large extent, the other most conservative justices,
*  Samuel Alito, seemed not to really like where this was going.
*  What if someone, this is a civil action, I think we could agree on the, if these were
*  criminal proceedings?
*  They're not convinced that there's enough due process in abbreviated civil domestic violence
*  hearings.
*  If this were a criminal proceeding, then you would have a determination of what you're
*  talking about.
*  Someone would be convicted of a crime, a felony assault or something.
*  And here you have something that's anticipatory or predictive where a court is, civil court
*  is making the determination.
*  And I think they were nervous that this great project of Bruin might be undermined by the
*  eventual decision in the Rahimi case.
*  And what about the liberal justices?
*  I mean, I'm assuming that they were pretty happy to have the center of the court agreeing
*  with the Biden administration on the case.
*  Well, the liberal justices, of course, are happy to sustain most gun control laws.
*  And they will vote for the government and against Rahimi.
*  But they also use the argument and might like to use the case to make a broader point.
*  I think it's under these principles.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Question about that, though.
*  I guess I'm trying to understand whether we can really be analyzing this consistent with
*  the Bruin test.
*  To question whether this history-based standard makes any sense.
*  I'm just trying to understand how the Bruin test works in a situation in which there
*  is at least some evidence that domestic violence was not considered to be subject to the kinds
*  of regulation that it is today.
*  So Justice Contange Brown Jackson, for instance, was asking a series of questions about, well,
*  why are we looking at the founding era to begin with?
*  What's the point of going to the founding era?
*  I mean, I thought it was doing some work, but if we're still applying modern sensibilities,
*  I don't really understand the historical framing.
*  The work that history is doing.
*  So liberal justices are saying, hey, conservatives, we agree this law should stand, but we disagree
*  that it's a narrow case.
*  Like we feel this leads to a broader question, which is the whole historical standard is
*  kind of wrong.
*  Right.
*  So there's disagreement about how you get there, what rationale you use to uphold this
*  law on domestic violence, but there's seeming consensus that the answer has to be that
*  the law is constitutional.
*  Okay.
*  So it sounds like pretty much all of the justices, perhaps with the exception of Alito and Thomas,
*  seem persuaded by pre-logger.
*  So what is the lawyer representing Rahimi and the gun right side of the case argue?
*  I mean, it sounds like he's going to have a pretty uphill battle.
*  Right.
*  Mr. Right?
*  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.
*  Rahimi is represented by a federal public defender named Matthew Wright.
*  He argues second.
*  And by the time he gets up, his central argument has been cut out from under him.
*  It feels like what the government is doing is looking down the dark well of American history
*  and seeing only a reflection of itself in the 20th and 21st century and saying that's
*  what history shows.
*  I think he was prepared to argue that there's no analogous ban from the founding era, and
*  therefore he wins.
*  Right.
*  That argument undermines so much in the first half of the argument, left him a little
*  unfocused and a little unsure about how to answer a series of questions from the justices
*  about the implications of his position in other settings.
*  Do you think that the Congress can disarm people who are mentally ill?
*  Setting aside an enumerated powers problem so they're in the district of Columbia or something
*  like that.
*  And his answers.
*  I can't be honest, Truth, Mr. Right.
*  I feel like you're running away from your argument.
*  Did not satisfy many of the justices.
*  I mean, is that position you really want to take?
*  So it was a different tone in the second half of the argument.
*  I'm so confused because I thought your argument was.
*  Where you had a less assured performance by someone who does not appear to be a pellet
*  specialist.
*  And there was a very telling exchange.
*  That's pertinent.
*  You don't have any doubt that your clients are dangerous person, do you?
*  The Chief Justice said, well, you agree that your client is dangerous.
*  Your Honor, I would want to know what dangerous person means.
*  I want to be someone who is shooting at people, but that's a good start.
*  So that's fair.
*  I'll say this.
*  You know, at that point where the Chief Justice of the United States is saying, your client
*  is dangerous because he goes around shooting at people.
*  You have an uphill fight ahead of you.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  So by the end of the argument, you had one very assured performance, one that was the
*  opposite of that performance, and a host of open questions about how they're going to
*  rule in this particular case and how that ruling will impact gun laws in countless other
*  cases.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Adam, you've described a pretty lopsided day in court with the solicitor general laying
*  a framework that most of the justice has agreed with.
*  What's your sense of how the court's going to rule?
*  I separate the court into three blocks.
*  Here's the middle of the court, the three Trump justices, Gorsuch, Barrett and Kavanaugh
*  and the Chief Justice Republican appointees, but by the standards of this Supreme Court,
*  relatively moderate, and they will probably try to write a decision as narrow as they can
*  upholding this law and kicking every other question about it down the road.
*  The liberals, Kagan, Sotomayor and Jackson will agree that the law should be upheld,
*  but they will almost certainly say, hey, it's time to rethink whether this new construct,
*  this new test from Bruin makes any sense at all.
*  And then on the far right side of the court, Justice's Thomas and Alito will either descend
*  or issue a grudging concurrence in which they will try to make the point that they meant
*  what Justice Thomas said in Bruin that unlike other parts of the Bill of Rights, this
*  is a part of the Bill of Rights that should be understood purely as an historical matter.
*  But Adam, if that's how the decision is written, is this actually that narrow of a ruling?
*  I mean, you'd mention that the middle of the road conservative justice is we're kind
*  of agreeing to this principal idea that Priligar was suggesting.
*  So it seems like that could actually open the door for gun control groups to try to do
*  all sorts of new stuff like no need to find a historical twin anymore.
*  It will depend a lot on how it's written.
*  People will make use of it as best they can, but you're right to say that to the extent
*  you're going to be able to discern general principles, not dead ringers, not historical
*  twins, that moves it away from the conservative legal movements way of thinking about the
*  Constitution, which is an effort to unearth its original meaning.
*  And more in the way liberals like to think about the Constitution as a living document
*  that sets out general principles that succeeding generations can use to address contemporary
*  problems.
*  It's almost as if Priligar has sort of moved the goal line on the standard, right?
*  I mean, in fairness to Justice Thomas in his opinion in Bruin, he did say that there
*  are two kinds of analogies.
*  There's one that is a reasonable fit and there's the other that, as he said, is a twin, a
*  dead ringer.
*  And he said, you only need the reasonable fit.
*  But what that reasonable fit is and how broad the principles you can draw on from history,
*  this will be a challenge for whoever writes the majority opinion, almost certainly a conservative,
*  because they will both have to adopt parts of this list or general's argument, but also
*  not go too far in opening the door to all kinds of general principles that would sustain
*  all kinds of gun laws.
*  So let's talk about what this case might mean for the future of gun laws in this country.
*  If the court rules in the way that you've indicated that it might, what does that mean
*  for the future of Bruin and how the court considers gun regulation?
*  Well, Bruin's not going anywhere, Sabrina, and the history test is not going anywhere.
*  And there's a ton of litigation.
*  There are all kinds of laws.
*  Let me give you a couple of cases that are already at the Supreme Court petition seeking
*  review have been filed in these cases.
*  And they present, I think, harder questions than Rahimi does.
*  One asks whether a federal law that disarms felons, people who have committed serious
*  crimes, is constitutional in every application.
*  And the guy bringing the case says, I made a false statement to obtain food stamps 30 years
*  ago.
*  Wow.
*  That shouldn't prohibit me from having a gun.
*  And you know, you're probably going to search the historical records in vain to find people
*  lying about food stamps in the founding year.
*  Right.
*  Similarly, there's a federal law that disarms people who use illegal drugs.
*  And someone who uses marijuana, fairly heavily, but maybe no different than a social drinker
*  drinks has brought a case to the Supreme Court having won in the lower courts, saying
*  he should not be disarmed because he's got a pot habit.
*  So on their face, there are much more sympathetic cases for the gun rights advocates.
*  Right.
*  The bottom line is just because Rahimi loses, as he probably will, doesn't mean these
*  other people will lose.
*  There are countless cases in the lower courts challenging all kinds of gun laws and not
*  only who can have guns, but also you can ask questions about where can you bring your gun?
*  Can you bring it to a school?
*  Can you bring it to a courthouse?
*  Can you bring it to the post office?
*  Can you bring it to Yankee Stadium?
*  And then a third category, what kinds of guns, so-called assault weapons, open question,
*  machine guns, probably not.
*  Handguns apparently, yes.
*  I mean, there's a million questions here.
*  Right.
*  And this Rahimi case may have actually been a bridge too far, but what you're saying is
*  there are a lot of other cases out there and a lot of other legal questions to be answered
*  that may not, in the minds of the 6-3 conservative court, be taking it too far.
*  Right.
*  It'll be very interesting to read, probably not till June, how exactly they grapple with
*  the history test in Rahimi in a way that rules against Rahimi, but tries not to do substantial
*  damage to their larger project of looking to history to decide whether gun laws are
*  constitutional or not.
*  Adam, you know, it strikes me that this is all very new, right?
*  I mean, we're in this new era of second amendment interpretation.
*  The court is now going to hear all of these new cases that figure out the details of what
*  the right to bear arms actually means in practice.
*  You're quite right, Sabrina.
*  Remember, it was only in 2008 for the first time in the history of the Republic that the
*  Supreme Court recognized an individual right to keep in bear arms.
*  It's a very new individual right.
*  Then the court basically went silent for more than a decade until 2022 in Bruin announcing
*  this new test.
*  Now we have the first application of the new test.
*  So that's kind of three major second amendment cases in the history of the Republic.
*  Interesting.
*  By contrast, in this term alone, there are five or six significant first amendment cases.
*  And that's characteristic.
*  The court has been explaining and refining the first amendment for many decades, or just
*  at the beginning of the road for the Supreme Court to start to tell us what exactly is meant
*  by the rights conferred by the second amendment.
*  And this Rahimi case will be a big step in the direction of trying to grapple with and
*  understand this constitutional right.
*  Adam, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what Altusio know today.
*  On Wednesday, the Union representing tens of thousands of actors reached a tentative
*  deal with entertainment companies in Hollywood on a contract.
*  The agreement includes pay increases, healthcare funding, and agreements on how AI will be
*  used.
*  It comes more than a month after the writer's guild of America negotiated its own deal
*  and clears the way for the $134 billion American movie and television business to swing back
*  into motion.
*  And Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said Wednesday that the Gaza Strip should be unified
*  with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority once the war ends.
*  The strongest signal yet from the Biden administration about what it would like to see at the end
*  of Israel's fight against Hamas in the enclave.
*  Blinken offered no details about how such an arrangement might be implemented, but restoring
*  the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, to power in Gaza
*  would not be easy even if Israel managed to end Hamas's rule.
