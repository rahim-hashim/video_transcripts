# The Supreme Court Tests Its Own Limits on Guns
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI0p8hgR8xA)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverdisy, and this is The Daily.
*  A critical gun case was argued before the Supreme Court this week, one of the few in
*  modern history.
*  But instead of opening further freedoms for gun owners, the court, with its conservative
*  supermajority, seemed ready to set a limit.
*  Today, my colleague Adam Litak explains.
*  It's Thursday, November 9th.
*  So Adam, we've just had oral arguments in a very important gun case.
*  And you previewed it for us in October, and it was going to be one of those tests of just
*  how far to the right this court was going to go.
*  So I've been watching your reporting, saw the case come up, and I wanted to give listeners
*  a real sense of what the answer to that question might be.
*  So let's dig into it.
*  Remind us why this case is so important.
*  So this case is important on two levels.
*  First level, very important.
*  Second level, even more important.
*  The very important question the court is looking at is, can the government make it a crime
*  for someone to have a gun if they're the subject of a domestic violence restraining order?
*  The presence of firearms combined with domestic strife is a recipe for lethal violence.
*  So the answer to that question, very important.
*  Even more important, though, is the way the court is going to approach that question,
*  Because not long ago in 2022, it announced a new Second Amendment standard by which to
*  judge all kinds of gun control measures, one that is rooted in history.
*  Right.
*  And this is, of course, the Bruin decision, which we've talked about a bunch on the show,
*  this kind of revolutionary decision that really threw all of the cards up in the air because
*  this historical requirement seemed to make it much harder to put new limits on guns.
*  So it was really a big win potentially for gun rights advocates.
*  It sure looked that way.
*  What the court told us last year is that in judging whether a gun control measure is constitutional
*  or not, courts are supposed to look at the founding era and see if there were analogous
*  restrictions back then, whether in the 1700s there were regulations that addressed, say,
*  domestic violence or whatever.
*  And the court said, it doesn't have to be a perfect match, but it has to be analogous.
*  And that, even as I say it, it's hard to put your finger on exactly what that means.
*  So using that historical test has caused both confusion and a mountain of work for
*  lower court judges who are not historians, who are meant now to find parchment documents
*  written in quill pen that may or may not match up with some contemporary law.
*  It's what one judge called a game of historical where's Waldo, of trying to find restrictions
*  that more or less match up to contemporary restrictions.
*  And just in the year after Bruin, courts have more than two dozen times struck down gun
*  control laws because they couldn't find historical analogies.
*  Right.
*  Okay.
*  So that's the landscape that the courts have been navigating for the past year, a big effect
*  with this new standard, which brings us to the case argued this week.
*  I remember when we last talked about it, the guy at the center of the case was pretty unsympathetic.
*  Remind us of the details.
*  So the case is called United States versus Rahimi.
*  It concerns a young man named Zaki Rahimi, who a few years ago physically assaulted his
*  girlfriend.
*  She seeks a restraining order.
*  A judge grants the restraining order saying that Rahimi is likely to commit violence again.
*  And that restraining order also tells him that he can't have guns.
*  And if he is found possessing a gun, that would be a federal crime.
*  But that doesn't stop Rahimi from committing a string of gun crimes.
*  In one case, he takes a shot at a fellow driver in a road rage incident.
*  In another, after someone is talking trash about him in social media, as he put it, he
*  shoots a gun into that person's house.
*  After a friend's credit card was declined at a Whataburger fast food restaurant, he
*  takes out a gun and fires several shots into the air.
*  Luckily, nobody was killed during these incidents.
*  But Zaki Rahimi was a one man crime spree.
*  And so these incidents draw the attention of law enforcement.
*  The authorities search his home.
*  They find guns.
*  They find a copy of the restraining order that says he can't have guns.
*  And he's charged with the federal crime of possessing guns while being subject to a domestic
*  violence restraining order.
*  And he's convicted.
*  And he gets a pretty stiff prison sentence.
*  So he challenges that ruling in federal court.
*  And gun rights groups do not love this because he's the least sympathetic possible protagonist
*  in a Second Amendment case.
*  And the lower courts initially ruled against Rahimi, said he could be prosecuted.
*  So he loses in a district court.
*  He loses in the appeals court.
*  But then Bruin happens.
*  Rahimi goes back to the appeals court.
*  And the appeals court under Bruin takes a fresh look at this question and concludes,
*  wait a second, we can't find a historical analog that closely matches up to domestic
*  violence.
*  And therefore, they rule for Rahimi and they strike down the law as unconstitutional.
*  Okay, so this is a clear example of the legal earthquake we were talking about, right?
*  Like, the historical standard was actually used to overturn the law that Rahimi had been
*  jailed under.
*  Right.
*  So the Biden administration takes the case to the Supreme Court.
*  They're probably delighted in one sense that they have such a sympathetic case to take
*  to the court.
*  And the justices accept the case as they almost always do when a lower court has struck down
*  a federal law.
*  I think the justices think that if anyone's going to be striking down federal laws as
*  unconstitutional, it ought to be the Supreme Court and not lower courts.
*  Okay, so that's how the case shot up to the Supreme Court.
*  And that brings us to the oral arguments that you heard this week.
*  So you were there, Adam.
*  Tell me how they began.
*  So the Biden administration took the case to the court and they get to go first.
*  General Proliger.
*  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court, guns and domestic abuse are a deadly combination.
*  They're represented by Elizabeth Preliger, the Solicitor General of the United States,
*  the Justice Department official, whose job it is to argue cases before the Supreme Court.
*  And she talks to the justices very much in the language of Bruin, in the language of
*  history.
*  Like Heller and McDonald, Bruin recognized that Congress may disarm those who are not
*  law-abiding, responsible citizens.
*  That principle is firmly grounded in the Second Amendment's history and tradition throughout
*  our nation's history.
*  She draws on earlier Supreme Court decisions which have used a phrase that says the Second
*  Amendment protects law-abiding and responsible citizens and gives them a right to keep and
*  bear arms.
*  And she bears down on that phrase.
*  This case focuses on the not responsible citizens principle and in this...
*  She says she's not focused in this case on law-abiding, but she is focused on responsible.
*  And initially there's some resistance to that, particularly from the Chief Justice.
*  Responsibility is a very broad concept.
*  I mean, not taking your recycling to the curb on Thursdays.
*  He thinks that responsible is too vague a phrase.
*  He says, well, what if I don't take out the recycling?
*  I suppose I'm not responsible.
*  What if I get in a fight at a ball game?
*  I suppose I'm not responsible.
*  What seems irresponsible to some, irresponsible to some people might seem like, well, that's
*  not a big deal to others.
*  So what is the model?
*  And she says...
*  So I want to be really clear that we're not using the term not responsible to describe
*  colloquially anyone who you might describe as demonstrating irresponsibility in many
*  of those contexts that you just described in your hypotheticals.
*  It's actually a kind of a term of orange.
*  ... intrinsically tied to the danger you would present if you have access to firearms.
*  It's actually a way of talking about whether people are dangerous or not.
*  Responsible people are not dangerous people.
*  And if you can show that someone is dangerous, there are general laws from the founding
*  era that allow the government to disarm people who are dangerous.
*  And that seems to get a lot of traction.
*  I think there would be little dispute that someone who was guilty, say, or even had a
*  restraining order, that domestic violence is dangerous.
*  So someone who poses a risk of domestic violence is dangerous.
*  So in other words, to bring this back to the historical standards set by Bruin, rather
*  than finding some exact one-to-one law in the books about domestic violence from way
*  back when, Prelager is basically saying it was clear that there were laws stating the
*  general principle that dangerous people should not have guns.
*  And we can apply that principle to domestic violence cases in the present day.
*  Right.
*  To rely on founding era laws, but at a high level of generality.
*  So they're not talking about domestic violence as such, but they're talking about you can
*  disarm dangerous individuals.
*  And that mode of argument by Prelager seemed to really work with most of the conservative
*  justices.
*  Do you think the level of generality, I take your point, you've got surety laws, you've
*  got a fray laws, you've got a lot of historical evidence.
*  Because they could rule in favor of the law and against Rahimi without doing damage to
*  their general project of making the Second Amendment be a subject of a history test.
*  Okay.
*  So interestingly, some of the conservative justices are coming around on the case.
*  But what about Clarence Thomas, who's, of course, the most conservative justice and
*  actually wrote the majority opinion on Bruin?
*  So Sabrina, Clarence Thomas and to a large extent the other most conservative justice,
*  Samuel Alito, seemed not to really like where this was going.
*  What if someone, this is a civil act, I think we could agree on the, if these were criminal
*  proceedings.
*  They're not convinced that there's enough due process in abbreviated civil domestic
*  violence hearings.
*  If this were a criminal proceeding, then you would have a determination of what you're
*  talking about.
*  Someone would be convicted of a crime, a felony, assault or something.
*  But here you have something that's anticipatory or predictive where a civil court is making
*  the determination.
*  And I think they were nervous that this great project of Bruin might be undermined by the
*  eventual decision in the Rahimi case.
*  And what about the liberal justices?
*  I mean, I'm assuming that they were pretty happy to have the center of the court agreeing
*  with the Biden administration on the case.
*  Well the liberal justices, of course, are happy to sustain most gun control laws and
*  they will vote for the government and against Rahimi.
*  But they also use the argument and might like to use the case to make a broader point.
*  Can I ask you a question about that though?
*  I guess I'm trying to understand whether we can really be analyzing this consistent with
*  the Bruin test.
*  To question whether this history-based standard makes any sense.
*  I'm just trying to understand how the Bruin test works in a situation in which there is
*  at least some evidence that domestic violence was not considered to be subject to the kinds
*  of regulation that it is today.
*  So Justice Katanji Brown Jackson, for instance, was asking a series of questions about why
*  Why are we looking at the founding era to begin with?
*  What's the point of going to the founding era?
*  I mean, I thought it was doing some work, but if we're still applying modern sensibilities,
*  I don't really understand the historical framing.
*  So liberal justices are saying, hey, conservatives, we agree this law should stand, but we disagree
*  that it's a narrow case.
*  Like we feel this leads to a broader question, which is the whole historical standard is
*  kind of wrong.
*  Right.
*  So there's disagreement about how you get there, what rationale you use to uphold this
*  law on domestic violence.
*  But there's seeming consensus that the answer has to be that the law is constitutional.
*  Okay, so it sounds like pretty much all of the justices, perhaps with the exception of
*  Alito and Thomas, seem persuaded by Prelogger.
*  So what is the lawyer representing Rahimi and the gun right side of the case argue?
*  I mean, it sounds like he's going to have a pretty uphill battle.
*  Right.
*  Mr. Wright?
*  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.
*  Rahimi is represented by a federal public defender named Matthew Wright.
*  He argues second.
*  And by the time he gets up, his central argument has been cut out from under him.
*  It feels like what the government is doing is looking down the dark well of American
*  history and seeing only a reflection of itself in the 20th and 21st century and saying that's
*  what history shows.
*  I think he was prepared to argue that there's no analogous ban from the founding era, and
*  therefore he wins.
*  Right.
*  That argument undermines so much in the first half of the argument, left him a little unfocused
*  and a little unsure about how to answer a series of questions from the justices about
*  the implications of his position in other settings.
*  Do you think that the Congress can disarm people who are mentally ill?
*  Setting aside an enumerated powers problem, so they're in the District of Columbia or
*  something like that.
*  And his answers...
*  That's really honest truth, Mr. Wright.
*  I feel like you're running away from your argument.
*  That did not satisfy many of the justices.
*  I mean, is that the position you really want to take?
*  So it was a different tone in the second half of the argument.
*  I'm so confused, because I thought your argument...
*  Where you had a less assured performance by someone who does not appear to be an appellate
*  specialist.
*  And there was a very telling exchange...
*  To the extent that's pertinent, you don't have any doubt that your client's a dangerous
*  person, do you?
*  The Chief Justice said, well, you agree that your client is dangerous.
*  Your Honor, I would want to know what dangerous person means.
*  I mean, someone who's shooting at people, that's a good start.
*  So...
*  That's fair.
*  I'll say this.
*  You know, at that point where the Chief Justice of the United States is saying, your client
*  is dangerous because he goes around shooting at people, you have an uphill fight ahead
*  of you.
*  Right.
*  So by the end of the argument, you had one very assured performance, one that was the
*  opposite of that performance, and a host of open questions about how they're going to
*  rule in this particular case, and how that ruling will impact gun laws in countless other
*  cases.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Adam, you've described a pretty lopsided day in court with the Solicitor General laying
*  a framework that most of the justices agreed with.
*  What's your sense of how the court's going to rule?
*  I separate the court into three blocks.
*  There's the middle of the court, the three Trump justices, Gorsuch, Barrett, and Kavanaugh,
*  and the Chief Justice, Republican appointees, but by the standards of this Supreme Court,
*  relatively moderate.
*  And they will probably try to write a decision as narrow as they can, upholding this law,
*  and kicking every other question about it down the road.
*  The liberals, Kagan, Sotomayor, and Jackson, will agree that the law should be upheld,
*  but they will almost certainly say, hey, it's time to rethink whether this new construct,
*  this new test from Bruin, makes any sense at all.
*  And then on the far right side of the court, Justices Thomas and Alito will either dissent
*  or issue a grudging concurrence in which they will try to make the point that they meant
*  what Justice Thomas said in Bruin, that unlike other parts of the Bill of Rights, this is
*  a part of the Bill of Rights that should be understood purely as a historical matter.
*  But Adam, if that's how the decision is written, is this actually that narrow of a ruling?
*  I mean, you'd mentioned that the middle of the road conservative justices were kind of
*  agreeing to this principal idea that Prilligard was suggesting.
*  So it seems like that could actually open the door for gun control groups to try to
*  do all sorts of new stuff, like no need to find a historical twin anymore.
*  It will depend a lot on how it's written.
*  People will make use of it as best they can.
*  But you're right to say that to the extent you're going to be able to discern general
*  principles, not dead ringers, not historical twins, that moves it away from the conservative
*  legal movements' way of thinking about the Constitution, which is an effort to unearth
*  its original meaning.
*  More in the way liberals like to think about the Constitution as a living document that
*  sets out general principles that succeeding generations can use to address contemporary problems.
*  It's almost as if Prilligard has sort of moved the goal line on the standard, right?
*  I mean, in fairness to Justice Thomas, in his opinion in Bruin, he did say that there
*  are two kinds of analogies.
*  There's one that is a reasonable fit, and there's the other that is, as he said, is
*  a twin, a dead ringer.
*  And he said you only need the reasonable fit.
*  But what that reasonable fit is, and how broad the principles you can draw on from history,
*  this will be a challenge for whoever writes the majority opinion, almost certainly a conservative,
*  because they will both have to adopt parts of the Solicitor General's argument, but also
*  not go too far in opening the door to all kinds of general principles that would sustain
*  all kinds of gun laws.
*  So let's talk about what this case might mean for the future of gun laws in this country.
*  If the court rules in the way that you've indicated that it might, what does that mean
*  for the future of Bruin and how the court considers gun regulation?
*  Well Bruin's not going anywhere, Sabrina, and the history test is not going anywhere,
*  and there's a ton of litigation.
*  There are all kinds of laws.
*  Let me give you a couple of cases that are already at the Supreme Court.
*  Petitions seeking review have been filed in these cases, and they present, I think, harder
*  questions than Rahimi does.
*  One asks whether a federal law that disarms felons, people who have committed serious
*  crimes, is constitutional in every application.
*  And the guy bringing the case says, I made a false statement to obtain food stamps 30
*  years ago.
*  That shouldn't prohibit me from having a gun.
*  And you're probably going to search the historical records in vain to find people lying about
*  food stamps in the founding year.
*  Similarly, there's a federal law that disarms people who use illegal drugs.
*  And someone who uses marijuana, fairly heavily, but maybe no different than a social drinker
*  drinks, has brought a case to the Supreme Court, having one in the lower courts saying
*  he should not be disarmed because he's got a pot habit.
*  So on their face, they're much more sympathetic cases for the gun rights advocates.
*  Right.
*  The bottom line is just because Rahimi loses, as he probably will, doesn't mean these other
*  people will lose.
*  There are countless cases in the lower courts challenging all kinds of gun laws, and not
*  only who can have guns, but also you can ask questions about where can you bring your
*  gun?
*  Can you bring it to a school?
*  Can you bring it to a courthouse?
*  Can you bring it to the post office?
*  Can you bring it to Yankee Stadium?
*  And then a third category, what kinds of guns?
*  So-called assault weapons?
*  Open question.
*  Machine guns?
*  Probably not.
*  Handguns?
*  Apparently yes.
*  I mean, there's a million questions here.
*  Right.
*  This Rahimi case may have actually been a bridge too far, but what you're saying is
*  there are a lot of other cases out there and a lot of other legal questions to be answered
*  that may not, in the minds of this 6-3 conservative court, be taking it too far.
*  Right.
*  And it'll be very interesting to read, probably not till June, how exactly they grapple with
*  the history test in Rahimi in a way that rules against Rahimi, but tries not to do
*  substantial damage to their larger project of looking to history to decide whether gun
*  laws are constitutional or not.
*  Adam, you know, it strikes me that this is all very new, right?
*  I mean, we're in this new era of Second Amendment interpretation.
*  The court is now going to hear all of these new cases that figure out the details of what
*  the right to bear arms actually means in practice.
*  You're quite right, Sabrina.
*  Remember, it was only in 2008, for the first time in the history of the Republic, that
*  the Supreme Court recognized an individual right to keep and bear arms.
*  It's a very new individual right.
*  Then the court basically went silent for more than a decade until 2022 in Bruin announcing
*  this new test.
*  Now we have the first application of the new test.
*  So that's kind of three major Second Amendment cases in the history of the Republic.
*  By contrast, in this term alone, there are five or six significant First Amendment cases.
*  And that's characteristic.
*  The court has been explaining and refining the First Amendment for many decades.
*  We're just at the beginning of the road for the Supreme Court to start to tell us what
*  exactly is meant by the rights conferred by the Second Amendment.
*  And this Rahimi case will be a big step in the direction of trying to grapple with and
*  understand this constitutional right.
*  Adam, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Wednesday, the union representing tens of thousands of actors reached a tentative
*  deal with entertainment companies in Hollywood on a contract.
*  The agreement includes pay increases, health care funding, and agreements on how AI will
*  be used.
*  It comes more than a month after the Writers Guild of America negotiated its own deal and
*  clears the way for the 134 billion dollar American movie and television business to
*  swing back into motion.
*  And Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the Gaza Strip should be unified
*  with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority once the war ends.
*  The strongest signal yet from the Biden administration about what it would like to see at the end
*  of Israel's fight against Hamas in the enclave.
*  Blinken offered no details about how such an arrangement might be implemented.
*  But restoring the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, to power
*  in Gaza would not be easy even if Israel managed to end Hamas's rule.
