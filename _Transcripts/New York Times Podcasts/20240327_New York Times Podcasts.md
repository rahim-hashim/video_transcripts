# Democratsâ€™ Plan to Save the Republican House Speaker
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaEBkNA-95c)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Boborjo.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, against all odds and expectations, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson keeps
*  managing to fund the government, inflame the far right of his party, and still hold on
*  to his job.
*  Now, as he prepares for his riskiest move to date, I speak with my colleague, Katie
*  Edmondson, about why it may be Democrats who save his speakership.
*  It's Wednesday, March 27.
*  Katie, I'd like to start with this dramatic scene that played out in the House of Representatives
*  a few days ago.
*  You happened to be in the room for it, so just describe it.
*  That's right.
*  Well, I was sitting in the press gallery in the House chamber Friday morning watching
*  for a spending vote to go through.
*  And instead, what caught my attention was Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, the
*  lawmaker from Georgia, striding down the center of the aisle on the House floor.
*  And she marched up to the House clerk's desk and she put a piece of paper into the hopper,
*  into the basket for legislation that sits on the House clerk's desk.
*  It immediately set off a rumor mill about what that piece of paper potentially could
*  be.
*  And sure enough, minutes later, we learned that she was essentially taking the first
*  step in the process to call a snap vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson.
*  And minutes later, Congresswoman Greene walks down the House steps where I and a number
*  of other reporters were waiting.
*  This is a betrayal of the American people.
*  This is a betrayal of Republican voters.
*  And she said, what set this into motion was that Speaker Mike Johnson had just again
*  relied on Democrats to push through a spending bill to keep the government funded.
*  This bill was basically a dream and a wish list for Democrats and for the White House.
*  It was completely led by Chuck Schumer, not our Republican speaker of the House.
*  That many Republicans, in fact, a majority of Republicans in the conference, opposed.
*  Our country is in crisis and we need real leaders that know how to fight, that know
*  how to walk in a room and don't get rolled by the deep state and don't get rolled by
*  the Democrats.
*  And she said that Mike Johnson needed to be put on notice.
*  I am saying the clock has started.
*  It's time for our conference to choose a new speaker.
*  Do you believe that there are more Republicans who support this?
*  At which point, those of us watching from home are all thinking to ourselves, here we
*  go again.
*  We are about to lose another House speaker to angry far-right House Republicans who,
*  of course, deposed the last speaker, Kevin McCarthy, in the fall for similar ideological
*  offenses, not being far right enough.
*  On first glance, it does seem like a case of deja vu, but I actually think that this
*  instance is going to turn out to be very different than the last iteration of this we saw with
*  speaker Kevin McCarthy.
*  Hmm.
*  Why would that be, Katie?
*  Why do we think it's not going to be the deja vu that it really looks like?
*  Well, I think to understand the full arc or the full trajectory of his speakership, we
*  kind of have to rewind back to when he was initially elected speaker.
*  And if you remember when he was elected in October, this was seen as a really big victory
*  for the far right.
*  And then, as a rank-and-file member, Congressman Mike Johnson was super conservative, a super
*  evangelical Christian, anti-abortion, anti-spending.
*  Far-right Republicans felt that they had just elected really one of their own to the speakership,
*  someone who was going to bow to their preferences and bring them to the table in a way that
*  they felt speaker Kevin McCarthy never really did.
*  We got our first test as to how Speaker Johnson was going to manage the far-right flank of
*  his conference almost immediately when he had to decide whether he was going to keep
*  the government funded.
*  Right.
*  This was exactly the same situation that Kevin McCarthy found himself in.
*  That's right.
*  And look, it was not a foregone conclusion that he would follow in former speaker Kevin
*  McCarthy's footsteps.
*  I had questions when he was initially elected as to whether he would let parts of the government
*  shut down, whether he would allow a total government shut down to show the far right
*  that he really was one of them, to show that he was going to put up this fight.
*  And in fact, he did the opposite over and over again over the next five months when
*  he was faced repeatedly with these funding deadlines.
*  Each time he made the calculation, we are not going to let the government shut down,
*  he made the calculation that if he wanted to keep the government funded, he knew with
*  his razor thin majority, he was going to have to turn to Democrats for votes.
*  And that's what he did.
*  Right.
*  And what he had told us when that was happening was allowances were being made for Johnson
*  from the far right because he was one of them.
*  But the question was, how long could he claim to be one of the far right when he was repeatedly,
*  in their eyes, betraying them by working with Democrats to get spending bills passed that
*  this far right group of lawmakers hated?
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  Congress ended up having to pass all of these short term stopgap spending bills to keep
*  the government funded.
*  They kept kicking the can down the road.
*  And that brings us to this vote on Friday on the latest spending bill that he had to
*  push through.
*  The final package to make sure the government is funded through this fiscal year.
*  This package included bills to fund the Department of Homeland Security, which obviously has
*  been a huge touch point for them in terms of their dissatisfaction with what's happening
*  at the southern border.
*  So this was always going to be a very politically tricky tranche of packages for negotiators
*  to get through.
*  And what ends up being proposed in this final spending bill to keep the government open?
*  Well, it ends up looking kind of like an old school compromise bill and that no one is
*  entirely happy with it, but that there are wins for both parties to take home and sell
*  to their base.
*  And so for Democrats, they got $1 billion in new spending for childcare subsidies for
*  low income families, for Head Start, early education.
*  And for conservatives, there was a lot of additional money in this bill to beef up security
*  at the southern border.
*  So that was more money for additional border patrol officers, more money for additional
*  detention beds for immigration enforcement facilities.
*  So on paper, it seems as though this is a bill that at least moderate or more centrist
*  Republicans will be able to get behind.
*  Right.
*  But in fact, what we see on the House floor when this bill is put to a vote is that not
*  only do the far right Republicans in the conference oppose it, but actually a majority of Speaker
*  Mike Johnson's conference opposes the bill.
*  And why was that?
*  Well, I think part of it is simply the top line number.
*  $1.2 trillion was the price tag on this bill.
*  And that is just a really big number for lawmakers to wrap their heads around, particularly
*  if you are a conservative member who has been saying for months that you want the Republican
*  speaker to use their gavel to try to reduce federal spending.
*  Got it.
*  And so in order to pass this bill, Speaker Johnson again relies on almost all Democrats
*  really to push this through.
*  And when the vote is done and tallied, we see that more than half of his conference
*  has in fact opposed this bill.
*  They voted it down.
*  Right.
*  What you have told us in the past, Katie, is an important mathematical equation.
*  When less than half of Republicans vote on something proposed by a Republican speaker,
*  it is basically considered the political equivalent of a cardinal sin.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  I mean, the unofficial rule within the House Republican conference is that a Republican
*  speaker is not even supposed to allow a vote on legislation if he knows that less than
*  half of his conference supports it.
*  So that's how we get to Marjorie Taylor Greene putting this piece of paper in the hopper,
*  starting this process of attempting to oust Speaker Johnson.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  So we're back to this question of why isn't this likely to be the beginning of the end
*  for Johnson?
*  It certainly looks like he has done the deed that would cost him his job here.
*  Well, one of the interesting things about this whole situation is that Congresswoman
*  Greene has intentionally structured this bill that she filed to essentially leave this threat
*  lingering over Speaker Mike Johnson's head.
*  This is going to be a slow boil.
*  She's not calling for an immediate snap vote.
*  She's going to kind of let it linger and let him squirm a little bit.
*  Right.
*  But the other thing is that it's not clear that the math is on her side.
*  Obviously, after she did this, we immediately went and asked Republicans who voted to oust
*  McCarthy if they were on board for a second go, essentially.
*  And a lot of them were very squeamish about the idea.
*  It's very unclear whether Marjorie Taylor Greene even has the support within the Republican
*  conference to oust Mike Johnson.
*  But of course, if you remember, a huge factor in all of this is what Democrats decide to
*  do.
*  Right.
*  And as a poster of Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Democrats ultimately decided, sure, we're
*  going to join in with this motion to oust him.
*  And it's not clear that that's the case for Mike Johnson at all.
*  And in fact, there have been conversations internally among Democrats for weeks, even
*  before Marjorie Taylor Greene files this resolution, talking about maybe they should try to save
*  him if someone does try to oust him.
*  And why would that be?
*  Because it's deeply unintuitive.
*  Democrats trying to save this House Speaker.
*  They didn't do it last time.
*  Why would they do it with Johnson?
*  Well, the first thing to say is that honestly, a lot of Democrats genuinely and personally
*  despised former Speaker Kevin McCarthy in a way that they don't with Speaker Mike Johnson.
*  Hakeem Jeffries told us last month that they view Mike Johnson as more of a blank slate.
*  It goes beyond that.
*  I don't think Democrats would save Mike Johnson for free, so to speak.
*  And what would be their price?
*  Well, their price would be for Speaker Mike Johnson to allow aid for Ukraine to come to
*  a vote on the House floor.
*  This is a huge priority for Democrats to make sure that the United States continues to help
*  Keefe fend off Russian aggression that they are now talking about if Speaker Johnson were
*  to allow that to come to a vote, if it were to pass.
*  It might be enough for them to cross party lines and vote to save Mike Johnson if a Republican
*  tried to oust him.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Katie, you just said that Speaker Johnson might end up being saved by House Democrats
*  because he may push through funding for Ukraine.
*  But my recollection is that Speaker Johnson has been hugely resistant to passing funding
*  for Ukraine.
*  He's avoided doing it over and over and over again.
*  So help me understand that.
*  That's right.
*  The rank and file congressman, he repeatedly voted against sending aid to Ukraine.
*  And within the first few months of his speakership, we saw it was an issue that he just really
*  did not want to touch, that he did not want to bring up aid for a vote, really did not
*  want to talk too much about his thinking on it.
*  But over the past few weeks, we started to see some of his calculations on Ukraine start
*  to change.
*  Hmm.
*  In what way?
*  It's interesting to watch the tightrope that he's walking here because publicly, initially,
*  he was keeping his statements very vague.
*  He'd never really wanted to address Ukraine aid specifically.
*  But I started to hear in private conversations behind closed doors, he started sounding much
*  more sympathetic to the plight of the Ukrainians, that he started telegraphing a willingness
*  to put some type of aid package for Ukraine on the House floor.
*  Hmm.
*  I heard from a donor, for example, who attended a fundraiser last month that the speaker attended
*  in which he gave what sounded like really kind of a rousing monologue about how he is
*  a Reagan Republican.
*  He believes in peace through strength.
*  He believes the United States has a role to play on the global stage when it comes
*  to fending off authoritarians.
*  He said Putin is a madman and the United States has a role to play and we're going to do our
*  job.
*  We start hearing that he is making sort of similar comments to lawmakers.
*  And this all, I think, comes to a head at the end of last week.
*  And he puts out a statement saying, when lawmakers return to Washington from their
*  Easter recess, we are going to consider aid for Ukraine.
*  And what explains why Speaker Johnson would suddenly want to fund Ukraine and kick yet
*  another hornet's nest in the pantheon of things that the far right does not like?
*  Well, part of it is that Senate Democrats had already called Speaker Johnson's bluff
*  on this issue.
*  So starting late last year, he had tried to put off a vote on Ukraine aid in the House
*  by saying that in order to bring up the issue, Democrats first needed to agree to sweeping
*  changes on the border, thinking probably the Democrats would never agree to it.
*  Instead, Senate Democrats went ahead and actually negotiated a deal and Speaker Johnson
*  rejected that package and Senate Republicans followed his lead and voted it down.
*  And so now when it comes to Ukraine, Democrats are looking at Speaker Johnson and saying,
*  okay, you know, we gave you what you wanted.
*  What's your excuse now for not letting this aid come to a vote?
*  Right.
*  But I also think one of the big things that's changed here for Mike Johnson as Speaker is
*  that he is now carrying this very heavy responsibility.
*  He has talked to donors about how shortly after being elected speaker, how he went to
*  the Situation Room and he received these briefings from the president's cabinets on the situation
*  in Ukraine.
*  He is now meeting with all of these leaders of NATO countries.
*  And so part of the message that he is hearing when he's in these rooms with Biden officials
*  and NATO allies is, do you really want to be a person who is solely responsible for
*  blocking this aid from getting to Kiev?
*  That is a really heavy message to internalize.
*  So what we should understand to have perhaps happened to Speaker Johnson when it comes
*  to Ukraine is a little bit of the journey he seems to have gone on when it comes to
*  spending bills, which is he has come to terms with the true stakes of his job, of what it
*  means to not just be a far right member of the House, but the Speaker of the entire institution.
*  And as a result, is ready to or seemingly ready to make some pretty big ideological
*  leaps.
*  Yeah, I think that's exactly right.
*  Essentially, as soon as he became Speaker, he was met with these high stakes occasions,
*  the first of which making sure the government did not shut down.
*  Now he is being forced to confront this question of whether to continue sending aid to Ukraine.
*  And his decision on that, putting some sort of aid package to a vote will probably be
*  the most politically risky move he's ever made.
*  Why is that even riskier than the spending bills, for instance?
*  The issue of sending aid to Ukraine has become such a toxic issue for Republican voters.
*  It's a deeply emotional issue, to be honest with you, in a way that spending just is not.
*  There's some component of, I think, among Republican voters, a sense of unfairness.
*  Why are we sending this money to another country instead of spending it on our own citizens
*  that really resonates for people?
*  And Republican lawmakers certainly are acutely aware of this.
*  But as you've told us, Johnson has made it clear that he will take up this money for
*  Ukraine very soon.
*  So my question is, how does he do that in a way that could possibly get through the
*  House without triggering a vote to oust him?
*  Or if it does trigger a vote to oust him, which perhaps inevitably it would, how does
*  he ensure that Democrats who want this Ukraine funding like this bill enough that they will
*  cross party lines and save him?
*  Well, there's a whole menu of options being considered, and it's my understanding that
*  the speaker himself has not really circled around any one particular option.
*  What Democrats would love to see him do would be to just put the Senate-passed aid package
*  on the floor for a vote.
*  But at the same time, that is exactly what Republicans would hate to see him do.
*  And so we're now in this realm where Speaker Johnson is searching for a path forward that
*  is going to incite the least amount of backlash from his own conference, but also hopefully
*  keep Democrats happy enough that they potentially would still vote to save him from an ouster
*  if it came to that.
*  Katie, it sounds like no matter what this Ukraine funding package ultimately looks like,
*  it's going to need a lot of Democratic House votes to pass and that these far-right Republicans
*  like Marjorie Taylor Greene will be furious.
*  And this could very well, I have to imagine, be the moment that a lawmaker like her says,
*  that's it, we are done with Mike Johnson.
*  And if she succeeds in trying to do that, I know the math is wonky, but if she succeeds,
*  I'm curious how Democrats are going to ultimately make the decision of whether to take the unprecedented
*  step of saving a Republican House speaker.
*  Well, that would be quite the scenario.
*  I think what it would look like is a long series of probably quite intense discussions
*  among the Democratic caucus where they would have to weigh, do we feel like Mike Johnson
*  was an honest broker here?
*  Did he deliver for Ukraine?
*  And look, Michael, a lot of them have for weeks now individually been floating the idea
*  that they would vote to save him if he did quote unquote, the right thing on Ukraine.
*  And so I would have to think that these promises would also weigh pretty heavily over their
*  calculations because what is the point of trying to get things done in a sort of coalition
*  government if you pull the rug out under the leader at the last moment?
*  There's a word you just used that feels very important in thinking about this moment,
*  Katie, and it's the word coalition.
*  We tend to think of our government, especially the House, as deeply partisan, Democrat, Republican.
*  But time and again, over the past year, year and a half, what we're seeing, because the
*  chamber is so closely split, is something resembling coalition government in foreign
*  countries where these occasional cobbled together groups that seem very unexpected get things
*  done.
*  And if that were to happen with Ukraine, especially, it starts to feel like we have something resembling
*  a somewhat functioning House of Representatives.
*  Does that feel right?
*  Yeah, I think so.
*  You have to remember, again, let's not give them too much credit.
*  This is a very low bar that we're talking about here.
*  We've been calling it a governing coalition, but it's really more of an emergency system
*  to keep everything from going off the rails.
*  This is making sure the government is not shut down and potentially a coalition emerging
*  to continue sending aid to a democracy that is fending off the advances of an authoritarian.
*  That being said, I think you are right to point out that time and time again on these
*  important decisions, the far right has essentially boxed themselves out of discussions because
*  it's become very clear that they will not support anything that really could become
*  law.
*  And it is a stark departure from where they started the beginning of the year.
*  I remember when it became very clear that House Republicans were going to have the majority,
*  that it was going to be a tiny majority, a lot of these Freedom Caucus members crowing
*  about the fact that this was going to force the Republican speaker into going into coalition
*  government with them.
*  It would force the Republican speaker to bow to their preferences, to their whims.
*  And instead, what we've seen is the opposite.
*  They have pushed the Republican speaker, whether it is Kevin McCarthy or Mike Johnson, into
*  the arms of Democrats.
*  And in the process, kind of rendered themselves powerless.
*  Right.
*  Instead of holding their speaker hostage, instead of holding the entire House hostage
*  and really dictating the terms of these big debates, they've become really less and
*  less relevant.
*  Yeah.
*  I think the story of this Congress is that when you have a group like the far right Freedom
*  Caucus, who just says no to everything all the time, then you essentially deal yourself
*  out of the process at key moments.
*  And the end result of it has been that everyone else in Congress has decided the only way
*  to move forward is to work around them.
*  Well, Katie, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thanks, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to nerd a.
*  So I'm worried that there is a significant mismatch in this case between the claimed
*  injury and the remedy that's being sought.
*  During oral arguments on Tuesday, a majority of the Supreme Court's justices appeared
*  to reject an effort by conservatives to limit access to a widely used abortion pill.
*  The case revolves around a lawsuit brought by anti-abortion doctors and groups who accused
*  the FDA of unlawfully expanding access to Mifepristone, which is used in about 60 percent
*  of abortions.
*  But both conservative and liberal justices, including Justice Katanji Brown Jackson, questioned
*  whether the small group of doctors challenging the FDA had suffered the type of direct harm
*  that would give them the legal grounds to bring the case in the first place.
*  They're saying because we object to having to be forced to participate in this procedure,
*  we're seeking an order preventing anyone from having access to these drugs at all.
*  And I guess I'm just trying to understand how they could possibly be entitled to that
*  given the injury that they have alleged.
*  And authorities are blaming the collapse of a major bridge in Baltimore on a cargo ship
*  that had lost power moments before it collided with the structure.
*  The collapse of the Francis Key Scott Bridge, which occurred at around 1.30 a.m. on Tuesday,
*  sent at least eight construction workers into the water below.
*  Six of them are still missing.
*  The ship's crew had issued a Mayday call shortly after losing power, giving officials
*  a chance to stop cars from crossing the bridge and likely preventing an even greater tragedy.
