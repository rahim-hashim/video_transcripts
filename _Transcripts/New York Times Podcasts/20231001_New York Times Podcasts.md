# The Sunday Read: ‘The Art of Telling Forbidden Stories in China’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO7XZ2h83CI)
*  Hi, my name is Han Zhang, and I'm a contributor to the New York Times magazine.
*  I write about the political and literary narratives that are shaping the Chinese world.
*  This week's Sunday Read is a recent story of mine from the magazine that started off
*  as a profile of a Chinese writer named Hao Qun.
*  Hao grew up in a farming village, but because he tested well in his university entrance
*  exam he got to go to school in Beijing.
*  Hao got a job in the corporate world in the early 2000s, but during a spell of boredom
*  he decided to take up creative writing.
*  He started posting chapters of a novel online and it just exploded, quickly attracting an
*  audience and the attention of publishers.
*  The internet novel came out as a very successful book, and for the next decade he enjoyed life
*  as a best-selling author.
*  But all this came to an end in the early 2010s when one of Hao's good friends was detained
*  by the Chinese authorities.
*  This friend was a scholar who was calling for political reforms.
*  Hao spoke up in defense of his friend, and very soon afterwards Hao found out that he
*  was blacklisted.
*  Being blacklisted meant that it became more or less impossible for him to continue to
*  speak or publish, whether online or in print.
*  His writing career was effectively over.
*  By taking a public stance that was sympathetic to a dissident, Hao had become a dissident
*  himself.
*  So in early 2020 Hao felt compelled to write about the Wuhan COVID lockdown, but he had
*  to do it all in secret.
*  He traveled to Wuhan and finished a nonfiction collection called Deadly Quiet City detailing
*  what he saw.
*  His publisher urged him to flee China before the book's release, and today he's living
*  in exile in Australia.
*  Hao isn't alone.
*  Meanwhile my story started out as a profile of Hao.
*  It quickly became a broader story of today's Chinese writers and about how the Communist
*  Party has mobilized to totally control how China is talked about.
*  Increasingly the internet under President Xi Jinping has become a place to exert power.
*  It hasn't been uncommon for someone's social media posts on WeChat or Weibo to be scrutinized
*  and deleted.
*  But these days, say something vaguely provocative in a social media post and your whole account
*  might be wiped out.
*  Or you might get invited for tea by the Chinese police, which is a slang for informal interrogations.
*  While reporting this story I reached out to many Chinese writers.
*  I think it's easy for people to think about this world as being defined by quote censorship.
*  I was a little fixated on that framing too at first, but then one of the writers I spoke
*  to said it's the wrong way to think about it.
*  Their wish is to be expressive, to create, and that was a clarifying moment for me.
*  There was a lot of goodwill, but a number of them told me it's just too difficult for
*  them to talk to a journalist right now.
*  Sometimes when I'm texting with a writer I can tell from the bubble icon that they are
*  deliberating.
*  I see them tapping away at a message and editing it for a long time before sending it.
*  And sometimes they retracted messages they'd already sent to me.
*  One writer said that life was like walking a tightrope.
*  Another told me that it was like living in a cage.
*  Let's say you're a writer.
*  You write the wrong thing.
*  Not only could your current book be banned, but so could the books that you've already
*  published.
*  That's what you could be facing.
*  Your career could just disappear overnight.
*  So here's my article, The Art of Telling Forbidden Stories in China, read by Emily Wu Zeller.
*  On an August evening in 2021, the bestselling Chinese novelist Hao Chun, who writes under
*  the name Murong Xue Chun, was procrastinating in his one-bedroom apartment.
*  He needed to be at Beijing Capital International Airport around 6 the next morning to catch
*  a flight to London, but he found it hard to pack.
*  Though Hao had a valid tourist visa to Britain, the Chinese government had kept tabs on him
*  for years, and it was possible that he would be prevented from leaving.
*  Other public intellectuals had tried to travel abroad only to discover that they were under
*  exit bans.
*  Hao might have been packing for a life of exile or a feudal trip to the airport.
*  His forthcoming book, Deadly Quiet City, would be published soon, and Hao's editors were
*  worried for his safety.
*  A collection of nonfiction, it was about the terrifying Kafkaesque early days of the COVID-19
*  outbreak in Wuhan, where residents had been subjected to an unrelenting information suppression
*  campaign.
*  Lihuanan's seafood wholesale market was considered the pandemic's origin point, but the state
*  had strangled reporting on daily life there.
*  When Hao arrived at the shuttered market in April 2020, he was met by tired guards, who,
*  to discourage him from taking photos, presented coercion as patriotic duty.
*  You know, the Americans are exhausting their ways to frame our country, one of them said.
*  It'd be no good if your photos were used by foreign media.
*  Please cooperate.
*  Hao was not deterred.
*  Square-faced and of average height, he has the look of a Chinese everyman.
*  You can picture him striking up conversations with ease.
*  And over the course of his reporting trip, he talked to people from all walks of life,
*  office employees, store owners, taxi drivers, and migrant workers.
*  Some introductions were made by reporters, who were forbidden to cover many aspects of
*  the pandemic.
*  These meetings were often hours-long affairs.
*  At the time, people had a strong desire to talk.
*  Hao recalls, one interview with a citizen journalist named Zhang Zhan lasted from noon
*  until after dusk.
*  All the while, he tried to shake off the eerie suspicion that he was being watched.
*  It was a paranoid hunch, but it wasn't an irrational one.
*  After all, the Guobao, or Chinese secret police, had shadowed him for the better part of a
*  decade.
*  In Wuhan, he conducted conversations at odd locations, on a street lined with office buildings
*  abandoned during the pandemic, or by the windy bank of the Yangtze River.
*  In his hotel room, he sometimes made phone calls under a blanket to ensure privacy.
*  One night, the sound of two men speaking in hushed voices outside his door left him thinking
*  of citizen journalists who had disappeared after posting reports from the city.
*  A distant memory flashed.
*  Five or six years ago in Beijing, Hao was invited to a celebration at the Swedish embassy.
*  A couple of Guobao officers showed up at his home a day before the event.
*  You won't be able to go, one of them informed Hao,
*  hinting that they would physically stop him if he tried.
*  Feeling rebellious, Hao insisted that he would go, but the Guobao taunted him.
*  Look at yourself, one of them said.
*  How many blows would you be able to withstand?
*  The men in the hallway eventually left, but Hao was covered in cold sweat.
*  Days after he departed from Wuhan, he got word that Zhang had been arrested.
*  Deadly Quiet City, which was published in the United States in March by the new press,
*  captures how such state enforced silence combined with inadequate access to medical
*  care intensified ordinary people's despair during the crisis.
*  Reading these stories, you not only feel for Hao's subjects, but
*  also fear for the political trouble Hao's unflinching clarity invites.
*  After Hao submitted the manuscript to Hardy Grant Books,
*  his Australian publisher, in spring 2021,
*  his editors urged him to leave China out of concern for his safety.
*  He equivocated, a few years in prison was a price he was willing to pay for
*  the book's publication.
*  His editors continued to press him, and by midsummer he had decided to flee.
*  He boarded the flight to London successfully, and
*  after a spell moved on to Melbourne.
*  When he spoke to me in late January,
*  he seemed to be in a bit of disbelief at where his life ended up.
*  Exile in Australia was worlds away from the circumstances in which he first
*  rose to prominence.
*  As China strove for a larger role on the international stage at the turn of
*  the century, the arrival of the internet and
*  a relatively relaxed political environment sparked an unprecedented boom in self-expression.
*  Afforded new license, many writers of Hao's generation tested the boundaries of
*  Chinese literary culture, writing stories that portrayed the lives of the rapidly
*  growing middle class and the opulent nouveau riche, while revealing the ethical
*  toll an increasingly materialistic worldview took on their nation.
*  These writers experimented with subjects that were quotidian, but taboo on the page.
*  Corruption, sexual desire and evolving gender roles,
*  often wielding confession to upend convention.
*  There is a Chinese idiom, spilled water will not flow backward.
*  This period opened a floodgate of creation that forever altered contemporary
*  Chinese literary culture.
*  Where the government once vetted all writing for its conformity to state values,
*  the internet provided a marketplace of ideas where writers could independently
*  attract tremendous audiences.
*  In today's China though, the pursuit of free expression requires writers to
*  weather new political pressures and operate under the ever watchful eye of
*  a complex state surveillance system.
*  This can resemble a high stakes game of whack-a-mole in which writers, editors and
*  online publishers try to outmaneuver the Chinese Communist Party's apparatus,
*  using any opportunity and resource at their disposal to chronicle life as they see it.
*  In 1978, as China emerged from Mao Zedong's cultural revolution and
*  decades of isolation, the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping inaugurated his opening up
*  policy.
*  This was both an overture to foreign business and a kind of domestic glasnost.
*  Over the next few decades, openness became a political buzzword.
*  By 2001, that ethos had borne its most symbolic fruits.
*  After campaigning for more than a decade, China became a member of the World Trade
*  Organization and was selected to host the 2008 Summer Olympic Games.
*  Jiang Zemin, Deng's successor, applied the old man's vision to cultural work,
*  which, as he said at the 2002 National Party Congress,
*  should be geared toward modernization, the world and the future.
*  Soon the government introduced policies like tax relief for
*  companies that transitioned from state owned bureaucracies to market driven
*  enterprises that equipped creative industries to produce dynamic and
*  competitive work.
*  This general openness coincided with the popularization of the Internet,
*  which was new enough that it largely eluded outmoded print era censorship.
*  For much of the first decade of the new millennium, the great firewall,
*  the infrastructure that bans an ever growing list of foreign websites,
*  hadn't yet been erected.
*  Chinese citizens could access Facebook, Wikipedia, and Google somewhat freely.
*  And the state had yet to develop a robust mechanism to track sensitive words as
*  a way to curb the spread of inconvenient information.
*  By the end of the decade, scholars and
*  writers debated public affairs on Weibo, a Twitter-like platform.
*  Elsewhere, vibrant communities emerged around niche passions.
*  The poet who writes under the name Xiaoyin remembers the new poetry websites of
*  that era as chaotic and fun spaces.
*  On sites like Poetry Life, his peers quarreled daily over matters like
*  the possibilities of colloquial poetry writing.
*  Anyone could start their own bulletin boards, he told me.
*  It was like bandits occupying hills and claiming to be kings.
*  This Internet-based community constituted a sea change for Chinese literature.
*  Until the mid 1990s, jobs were assigned by the government.
*  For generations of writers, membership in the state-sponsored Writers Association,
*  and staff jobs at party publications or
*  state news agencies were more or less the only path to a career in letters.
*  Some of China's most prestigious novelists, like Yan Lianke and Mo Yan,
*  known for their realist novels about the village life of their youth,
*  published their debuts while serving in the People's Liberation Army.
*  But by the 2000s, such formal affiliations were no longer a prerequisite.
*  Anyone with a computer and an Internet connection could share his or
*  her work on literary forums, where censorship was nascent and piecemeal.
*  Free from the scrutiny of editors and censors, writers had a more direct
*  relationship with their readers, who relished their refreshingly
*  unabashed accounts of their historical moment.
*  Explaining the differences between these generations to me over the phone,
*  a celebrated novelist who writes under the name Ayi borrowed concepts from
*  classic martial arts stories.
*  Traditional writers, he told me, inhabited Miaotang, or temples and courts.
*  Whereas writers of the Internet age inhabited Jianghu, or
*  the unkempt natural world.
*  Unburdened from the institutional gaze, they explored subjects and
*  feelings that didn't align with the state's values.
*  One essayist, writing under the name Muzi Mei, earned her reputation by
*  publishing sex journals detailing her one-night stands and
*  flirtatious encounters with rock stars and other public figures.
*  If the era's cosmopolitanism was thrilling, it was also morally ambiguous.
*  Sometimes upward mobility could engender a spiritual hollowness.
*  Without the relative freedom that the open Internet provided,
*  how might never have started writing?
*  After testing into a university in Beijing and studying law, in 2000,
*  he got a job in HR at a cosmetics company and
*  moved to the southern metropolis Shenzhen, the heartland of Deng's reforms.
*  When Hao became a writer, he was an untethered man.
*  His parents, who had been farmers in his rural home village,
*  had both died by the time he was in college.
*  He was briefly married in the late 1990s, but
*  that relationship ended in divorce in 2000.
*  Browsing one of the literature bulletin boards,
*  he came across a serialized novel titled My Beijing,
*  published under the pseudonym Drunken Fish.
*  The story of a group of friends finding their way in the rapidly growing and
*  suddenly wealthy capital inspired Hao to try his hand at a story that
*  reflected his own time in China's urban environments.
*  We wrote about the stories happening around us, our own anxieties,
*  expectations, and sense of ruthlessness, he told me.
*  Soon he had begun a novel about a recent university graduate in the southwestern
*  city Chengdu, navigating office politics and questioning his marriage.
*  By April 2002, he was posting chapters to several bulletin boards under his new
*  pseudonym, Murong Xuechun, a name reminiscent of a hero in a martial arts novel.
*  Eventually titled Leave Me Alone, the novel captured the hopes and
*  delusions of recent college graduates who, like Hao, grew up in modest circumstances
*  and now found themselves surrounded by temptations of fast cash and meaningless sex.
*  Hao's depiction of Chengdu's seedy underbelly became a sensation on forums
*  like Tianya, one of the period's largest blogging platforms.
*  Once, a colleague recommended the novel to Hao without knowing that he was
*  Murong Xuechun.
*  Within two months, he was approached by booksellers and publishers, and
*  the novel came out that December.
*  He enjoyed the spoils of success, frequently treating friends to fancy dinners and
*  letting them borrow money when they needed it.
*  Beijing is divided into six concentric rings radiating from downtown.
*  Generally speaking, the closer to downtown, the more prosperous the neighborhood.
*  By 2010, Hao lived in a penthouse in the third ring.
*  Hao's fiction tended to explore imperfect protagonists, abuse of power, and
*  the moral corrosion of city life.
*  In his 2008 bestselling novel, Dancing Through Red Dust, the narrator,
*  Wei Da, is a well-connected partner at a law firm who moves with confidence
*  through gambling dens and corporate offices alike.
*  Wei comes from a simple family, but in a world where money keeps everything in
*  motion and compassion is weakness, his survival instincts and
*  desire for influence overwhelm his better nature.
*  In one scene, Wei runs over a poor farmer while driving drunk.
*  In the end, the farmer is forced to pay Wei for damaging his car.
*  Hao's transition from a pulp fiction writer to a daring documentarian and
*  critic of the government was a natural progression.
*  From the get-go, he has been completely obsessed with how people are corrupted by
*  the environment in which they live, says Megan Walsh, author of The Subplot,
*  a book about contemporary Chinese literature.
*  In reading his work, she says, you come to believe that people can exist in and
*  perpetuate horrendous cycles of injustice.
*  Authorities mostly viewed Hao and other newcomers with suspicion.
*  At National Writers Association conferences,
*  leaders urged literature workers to fight against diversification of thought,
*  ideas that subverted authoritarian patriarchal norms.
*  Later, at a propaganda meeting, the deputy party secretary of Chengdu criticized
*  Hao's fiction for damaging the city's image.
*  The more correct local performance artist, Li Boqing,
*  accused Hao of failing to present the city's mainstream features.
*  To him, Li said in an interview, Chengdu was a beautiful,
*  kind and tolerant mother who also has a graceful figure.
*  Disgusted by the lust and greed portrayed in Hao's work,
*  Li insisted that writers should focus on the city's relaxing atmosphere,
*  famed history of brocade production, and beautiful Chinese hibiscus.
*  As Hao went through a political awakening, that distrust turned into persecution.
*  In 2011, Hao learned that his close friend, Ran Yunfei,
*  a scholar of classical Chinese, was arrested and charged with subversion.
*  After he warned that if China didn't make reforms,
*  it risked an upheaval like the Jasmine Revolution protests in North Africa.
*  On Weibo, where Hao had millions of followers,
*  he denounced the arrest and called Ran the conscience of the country.
*  Ran was released from detention that same year, but
*  Hao's encounter with state repression radicalized him.
*  Until that point, I had enjoyed my life as a bestselling author and
*  avoided getting into trouble, he says.
*  But when their hands reached those close to me, I had to step up.
*  Hao's writing steered to social commentary, and
*  he began contributing to the International New York Times.
*  The repercussions were swift.
*  Hao was banned from Weibo, and before long it became clear that he was blacklisted.
*  In 2014, he started to receive invitations to tea,
*  slang for informal police questioning.
*  In the next few years, he had tea about 40 times, as often as once a month.
*  Sometimes, as if they were old friends, officers would ask what Hao had been up
*  to or what he had been thinking about.
*  His writing career essentially came to an end.
*  He never published another book in China, and
*  he made his living by ghostwriting screenplays for movies and TV shows.
*  When out of habit, he reached for the bill while out at dinner,
*  friends dissuaded him and insisted that he needed to think about his future.
*  By the time he left China, he had rented a studio apartment outside Beijing's Fifth Ring.
*  36 of his friends, writers, scholars, activists, and
*  lawyers had been detained or sentenced to prison.
*  Late at night, as he fell asleep, he wondered when his turn would come.
*  I didn't have long term plans, he says,
*  because I felt that I had one foot in prison already.
*  Under President Xi Jinping, who took office in 2013,
*  the Communist Party has sought to assert China's position as a rising global power.
*  Domestically, Xi's government has shown less tolerance for
*  the kind of writing that Deng's reforms fostered, and has been keen on creating
*  a centralized discourse that nurtures national pride through an emphasis on
*  telling China's story well, a piece of ubiquitous political boilerplate
*  that Xi introduced into the national consciousness.
*  In the spring of 2013, less than two months after Xi became president,
*  state outlets reported on a party central document that instructed cadres to
*  prioritize the struggles in the ideological sphere, and
*  to reinforce our management of propaganda on the cultural front, and
*  cut off channels of erroneous ideologies and speech at their headwaters.
*  This course correction was a tacit admission that Deng's opening up policy
*  stoked growing conversation about notions like feminism, queerness, and
*  civil rights, and that their discussion needed to be curbed.
*  To that end, the state has developed a robust surveillance and censorship
*  apparatus.
*  The guobao, local police officers, publishing authorities, and
*  digital surveillance tools, are all mobilized into a multifaceted operation,
*  whose purpose is to control China's story.
*  That machinery has transformed the internet from a place of experimentation
*  into exhibit A of the state's power.
*  This often takes the form of a 404 error page, a notice that the state has deemed
*  an article or a piece of social media content unfit for public consumption.
*  No one is immune.
*  In 2021, former Prime Minister Wen Jiabao published an essay remembering his mother,
*  writing that China should be a country full of justice and fairness.
*  On the popular social media app WeChat, users couldn't share Wen's essay on their
*  timelines or private chats.
*  Xi's approach has strangled free expression.
*  According to Freedom House, which surveys internet freedom around the world by
*  tracking control measures, the freedom of the Chinese internet has dropped by 40%
*  since 2011.
*  And for the last eight years, China has earned the ignominious distinction of
*  being the most repressive among the countries that the organization monitors.
*  In publishing, each new title requires individual approval,
*  which can result in an exhausting process.
*  Once a publisher decides to pursue a book proposal, it will be reviewed by in-house
*  editors before they submit a request to the National Administration of Press and
*  Publication, which decides whether the idea will materialize.
*  In the last decade, the publication of new titles categorized as literary has
*  decreased by 15%.
*  Seven out of 10 literary titles published in 2013 were new works.
*  By 2021, reprints made up half of publications.
*  In this environment of intense censorship and fractured cultural infrastructure,
*  writers must be flexible.
*  Willing to forgo old forms and move fluidly among genres if they want to
*  continue making meaningful work, journalists become serial entrepreneurs
*  who dream up new ways of creating to fill the lacunae they see.
*  When one project becomes infeasible, they move on to another.
*  Zhang Wenmin, a veteran journalist who writes under the name Jiang Xue,
*  became known for her coverage of a 2002 civil rights case in which four policemen
*  showed up at a newlywed couple's home because they were watching porn.
*  Among many colleagues, there had been the consensus that no matter what,
*  they had to try to say a little more.
*  Zhang recalls, sensing increasing pressure.
*  She quit institutional journalism in 2015 to become a self-publishing blogger.
*  With long straight hair, Zhang dresses simply.
*  In contrast to the steely insistence on common sense in her writing,
*  there is a vulnerable shyness in her physical presence.
*  I've never been cool, she joked softly, her arms draped in front of her body.
*  On WeChat, she wrote stories about dissidence,
*  something no news outlet would allow, she said.
*  Because it's like violating a tian tiao, a statute sent from heaven.
*  She was uninvited from journalism events.
*  She lost her Weibo and WeChat accounts, becoming virtually invisible.
*  Friends and family think I went too far, Zhang said.
*  When her city, Xi'an, went into lockdown,
*  a friend offered her own WeChat account to publish Zhang's journals.
*  They went viral, but also drew attacks.
*  The worsening media environment in the last ten years makes people see things
*  upside down, she said.
*  When you do the most normal thing, it appears abnormal.
*  Elsewhere, an even more bottom-up kind of writing community appeared.
*  Its participants are assisted by affordable technology.
*  Three quarters of the Chinese population are smartphone owners,
*  allowing a wider swath of people to publish more varieties of writing.
*  While Hao's generation of writers was predominantly middle class and
*  upwardly mobile, the spread of internet-enabled technology has allowed
*  working class people without degrees to pursue literature.
*  On social media platforms like KuaiShou, where users post short video clips,
*  factory workers, masseuses, and truck drivers started to compose poems.
*  In 2017, a 44-year-old single mother,
*  Fan Yusu, became a literary star almost overnight after her autobiographical essay,
*  I Am Fan Yusu, went viral on WeChat.
*  Beginning with a striking line, My Life is a Hard to Read Book.
*  Destiny bound me poorly.
*  It narrates her rural youth and eventual employment by an uber-rich
*  Beijing businessman who hires her to take care of the child he shares with a mistress.
*  Six days a week, she leaves her own daughters behind and attends to the love child.
*  She started writing in her free time because she thought,
*  to live, you have to do something besides eating.
*  The journalist and editor Yang Ying has been a champion for
*  overlooked stories and the platforms that host them.
*  She has managed to build a successful career despite cycles of setback and
*  rebirth.
*  A former reporter for a Business Weekly, she left that magazine in 2014 after
*  growing dissatisfied with conventional media.
*  Along with a couple of other editors, she started a popular digital outlet whose
*  name translates to Curiosity Daily that covered subjects like the Shanghai Pride
*  Parade, a Texan who moved into a dumpster for a year to explore sustainable living.
*  And the work of the Japanese auteur, Hirokazu Koreeda,
*  who once commented that creators should keep influence of the state at bay.
*  After the authorities suspended the outlet twice for
*  illegally building a news gathering and editing team, the outfit dissolved in 2019.
*  Yang persisted, following that project with a digital magazine called Xiao Niao,
*  or Little Birds, in which she published literary writing on subjects that could
*  no longer be explored in journalism.
*  Literature is our last refuge, Yang told me.
*  In stories, people can communicate with one another.
*  Zhang Jieping, a journalist turned media entrepreneur and
*  founder of the fellowship Zai Chang, or On the Scene, told me.
*  Their joys and sadness become relatable.
*  With today's news outlets, it's increasingly hard to achieve that.
*  As journalism institutions collapsed, Zhang built Zai Chang to create a community and
*  a ladder for aspiring journalists to learn to tell such stories.
*  Editors like Yang and Zhang want to correct that dearth of connection
*  by normalizing what Yang called everyday messiness.
*  Topics that the state considers counterproductive,
*  like disappearing traditional villages and
*  the rising diagnosis of anxiety in the aftermath of disasters.
*  In Xi's China, though, publishing this work means courting unwanted attention.
*  During Shanghai's COVID lockdown, Xiao Niao published a special edition that
*  collected haunting real stories, including one about a young woman who evaded the rules
*  to cross the city to see her critically ill father.
*  Soon, Yang was treated to tea by her local police.
*  Apparently swamped with tea appointments,
*  they asked her to remove the entire issue from the publication's mobile app.
*  She complied.
*  Without public distribution channels,
*  the special issue of Xiao Niao lives as a PDF passed around among friends.
*  I have no idea how far it has reached, Yang said.
*  There is something Sami's dot like to it, she said,
*  referring to the underground literature of 20th century Eastern Europe,
*  which circulated hand to hand.
*  In today's China, people create knowing that publishing is transient in nature.
*  Online articles can be taken down, books can be removed from the shelves,
*  writers can be blacklisted, bloggers can be disappeared.
*  One of the websites Xiao Yin frequented,
*  Poetry Life, announced its shutdown on July 13th.
*  Poetry Life was born on the internet where it will dissipate.
*  The announcement read, it has been a mirage as well as our real land.
*  Yet many people go on writing in whatever capacity they can manage.
*  If the goal was to escape censorship, then we wouldn't be in this business, Yang said.
*  They focus instead on creating a new possibility of public writing,
*  a vibrant breathing thing.
*  Here people are quick to forget, she said.
*  Sometimes they are forced to forget.
*  Other times new events overwrite the old before you know it.
*  It's like we live in an environment where people can't keep going if they don't
*  learn to forget.
*  She paused to search for the precise words.
*  Literature is a good way to help people remember things.
*  Earlier this year, Zhang Wenmin and
*  Hao were introduced by mutual friends and met while they were each traveling.
*  Pondering her future, Zhang was both curious about and
*  daunted by the examples of Hao and other expatriate writers.
*  At a dinner with other Chinese writers, she spoke almost to herself.
*  How does a writer come to accept their status of exile?
*  In Melbourne, Hao is curious about his new surroundings.
*  Every experience presents opportunities for discoveries.
*  After contracting COVID and speaking with a public health official on the phone,
*  he was prescribed free medication.
*  Isn't this socialism?
*  He wondered.
*  He went to observe a local election and chatted with people outside.
*  It's eye opening, he says.
*  There is a party representing sex workers.
*  There is also a party for animal rights.
*  Hao is eager to master his new language, but is baffled by the choice of other
*  exiled writers like the late Milan Kundera to abandon their mother tongues in their work.
*  The act of writing, of making sense of one's experiences,
*  is so bound up in the language a person speaks.
*  Along with all the little intricacies and inexplicable imagery within it.
*  To abandon it is almost like abandoning yourself.
*  He told me the story behind his favorite Chinese phrase,
