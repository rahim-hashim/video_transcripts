*  Hi, my name is Han John and I'm a contributor to the New York Times magazine.
*  I write about the political and literary narratives that are shaping the Chinese world.
*  This week's Sunday read is a recent story of mine from the magazine that started off as
*  a profile of a Chinese writer named Hao Chiang.
*  Hao grew up in a farming village, but because he tested while in his university entrance exam,
*  he got to go to school in Beijing.
*  How got a job in a corporate world in the early 2000s, but during a spell of boredom,
*  he decided to take up creative writing.
*  He started posting chapters of a novel online and it just exploded, quickly attracting an
*  audience and the attention of publishers.
*  The internet novel came out as a very successful book and for the next decade, he enjoyed
*  life as a best-selling author.
*  But all this came to an end in the early 2010s when one of Hao's good friends was detained
*  by the Chinese authorities.
*  This friend was a scholar who was calling for political reforms.
*  Hao spoke up in defense of his friend and very soon afterwards, Hao found out that he
*  was blacklisted.
*  Being blacklisted made that it became more or less impossible for him to continue to speak
*  or publish, whether online or print.
*  His writing career was effectively over.
*  By taking a public stance that was sympathetic to a dissident, Hao had become a dissident
*  himself.
*  Still in early 2020, Hao felt compelled to write about the Wuhan COVID lockdown.
*  That he had to do with all in secret.
*  He traveled to Wuhan and finished a nonfiction collection called Deadly Quiet City, detailing
*  what he saw.
*  His publisher urged him to flee China before the book's release and today he's living
*  in exile in Australia.
*  Hao isn't alone.
*  Although my story started out as a proof of Hao, it quickly became a broader story of today's
*  Chinese writers and about how the Communist Party has mobilized to totally control how
*  China is talked about.
*  Increasingly, the internet underpressed in Xi Jinping has become a place to exert power.
*  It hasn't been uncommon for someone's social media posts on WeChat or Weibo to be
*  scrutinized and deleted.
*  But these days, say something vaguely provocative in a social media post and your whole account
*  might be wiped out.
*  Or you might get invited for tea by the Chinese police, which is a slang for informal interrogations.
*  While reporting this story, I reached out to many Chinese writers.
*  I think it's easy for people to think about this world as being defined by quote, censorship.
*  I was a little fixated on that framing too at first, but then one of the writers I spoke
*  to said it's the wrong way to think about it.
*  Their wish is to be expressive, to create, and that was a clarifying moment for me.
*  There was a lot of good will, but a number of them told me it's just too difficult for
*  them to talk to a journalist right now.
*  Sometimes when I'm texting with a writer, I can tell from the bubble icon that they're
*  deliberating.
*  I see them tapping away at a message and editing it for a long time before sending it.
*  And sometimes they retracted messages they'd already sent to me.
*  One writer said that life was like walking a tightrope.
*  Another told me that it was like living in a cage.
*  Let's say you're a writer, you're rather wrong thing, not only could your current book
*  be banned, but so could the books that you've already published.
*  That's what you could be facing.
*  Your career could just disappear overnight.
*  So here's my article, The Art of Telling For Business Stories in China, read by Emily
*  Uzzeller.
*  On an August evening in 2021, the best-selling Chinese novelist, Howe Chun, who writes
*  under the name Mu Rong Shui Tsui, was procrastinating in his one bedroom apartment.
*  He needed to be at Beijing Capital International Airport around 6th and next morning to catch
*  a flight to London.
*  But he found it hard to pack.
*  Though how had a valid tourist visit a Britain, the Chinese government had kept tabs on him
*  for years, and it was possible that he would be prevented from leaving.
*  Other public intellectuals had tried to travel abroad only to discover that they were under
*  exit bans.
*  Howe might have been packing for a life of exile or a feudal trip to the airport.
*  This forthcoming book, Deadly Quiet City, would be published soon.
*  And how's editors were worried for his safety.
*  A collection of nonfiction.
*  It was about the terrifying Kafka-esque early days of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, where
*  residents had been subjected to an unrelenting information suppression campaign.
*  Lohanan seafood wholesale market was considered the pandemic's origin point, but the state
*  had strangled reporting on daily life there.
*  When Howe arrived at the shuttered market in April 2020, he was met by tired guards,
*  who, to discourage him from taking photos, presented coercion as patriotic duty.
*  You know the Americans are exhausting their ways to frame our country.
*  One of them said, it'd be no good if your photos were used by foreign media.
*  Please cooperate.
*  Howe was not deterred.
*  Square faced and of average height.
*  He has the look of a Chinese every man.
*  You can picture him striking up conversations with ease.
*  And over the course of his reporting trip, he talked to people from all walks of life,
*  office employees, store owners, taxi drivers and migrant workers.
*  Some introductions were made by reporters, who were forbidden to cover many aspects of
*  the pandemic.
*  These meetings were often hours long affairs.
*  The time people had a strong desire to talk, how recalls.
*  One interview with a citizen journalist named Zhang Zhang lasted from noon until after dusk.
*  All the while, he tried to shake off the eerie suspicion that he was being watched.
*  It was a paranoid hunch, but it wasn't an irrational one.
*  After all, the guo bau or Chinese secret police had shouted him for the better part of
*  a decade.
*  In Wuhan, he conducted conversations at odd locations.
*  On a street lined with office buildings abandoned during the pandemic, or by the windy
*  bank of the Yangtze River.
*  In his hotel room, he sometimes made phone calls under a blanket to ensure privacy.
*  One night, the sound of two men speaking in hushed voices outside his door left him thinking
*  of citizen journalists who had disappeared after posting reports from the city.
*  A distant memory flashed.
*  Five or six years ago in Beijing, how was invited to a celebration at the Swedish Embassy.
*  A couple of guo bau officers showed up at his home a day before the event.
*  You won't be able to go.
*  One of them informed how, hinting that they would physically stop him if he tried.
*  Feeling rebellious, how insisted that he would go.
*  But the guo bau taunted him.
*  Look at yourself.
*  One of them said.
*  How many blows would you be able to withstand?
*  The men in the hallway eventually left.
*  But how was covered in cold sweat?
*  Days after he departed from Wuhan, he got worried that Zhang had been arrested.
*  Deadly Quiet City, which was published in the United States in March by the new press,
*  captures how such state-enforced silence, combined with inadequate access to medical care,
*  intensified ordinary people's despair during the crisis.
*  Reading these stories, you not only feel for House subjects, but also fear for the political
*  trouble House unflinching clarity in vites.
*  After House submitted the manuscript to Hardy Grant Books, his Australian publisher, in
*  spring 2021, his editors urged him to leave China out of concern for his safety.
*  He equivocated.
*  A few years in prison was a price he was willing to pay for the book's publication.
*  His editors continued to press him, and by mid-summer he had decided to flee.
*  He boarded the flight to London successfully, and after a spell moved on to Melbourne.
*  When he spoke to me in late January, he seemed to be in a bit of disbelief at where his
*  life ended up.
*  Exile in Australia was worlds away from the circumstances in which he first rose to prominence.
*  His China strove for a larger role on the international stage at the turn of the century.
*  The arrival of the internet and a relatively relaxed political environment sparked an unprecedented
*  boom in self-expression.
*  Afforded new license, many writers of House generation tested the boundaries of Chinese
*  literary culture, writing stories that portrayed the lives of the rapidly growing middle class,
*  and the opulent Nouveau-Riche, while revealing the ethical toll in increasingly materialistic
*  worldview took on their nation.
*  These writers experimented with subjects that were quotidian, but taboo on the page.
*  Corruption.
*  Sexual desire and evolving gender roles.
*  Often wielding confession to up-end convention.
*  There is a Chinese idiom.
*  Spilled water will not flow backward.
*  This period opened a floodgate of creation that forever-raltored contemporary Chinese literary
*  culture.
*  Where the government once vetted all-writing for its conformity to state values, the internet
*  provided a marketplace of ideas where writers could independently attract tremendous audiences.
*  In today's China, though, the pursuit of free expression requires writers to weather
*  new political pressures and operate under the ever-watchful eye of a complex state surveillance
*  system.
*  This can resemble a high-stakes game of whack-a-mole, in which writers, editors, and online publishers
*  try to outmaneuver the Chinese Communist Party's apparatus, using any opportunity and resource
*  at their disposal to chronicle life as they see it.
*  In 1978, as China emerged from Mao Zedong's cultural revolution and decades of isolation,
*  the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping inaugurated his opening up policy.
*  This was both an overture to foreign business and a kind of domestic glass-nosed.
*  Over the next few decades, openness became a political buzzword.
*  By 2001, that ethos had born its most symbolic fruits.
*  After campaigning for more than a decade, China became a member of the World Trade Organization
*  and was selected to host the 2008 Summer Olympic Games.
*  Jiang Zemin, Deng's successor, applied the Old Man's vision to cultural work, which, as
*  he said at the 2002 National Party Congress, should be geared toward modernization, the
*  world, and the future.
*  Soon the government introduced policies like tax relief for companies that transitioned
*  from state-owned bureaucracies to market-driven enterprises that equipped creative industries
*  to produce dynamic and competitive work.
*  This general openness coincided with the popularization of the Internet, which was new enough
*  that it largely eluded outmoded print-era censorship.
*  For much of the first decade of the new millennium, the Great Firewall, the infrastructure that
*  bans an ever-growing list of foreign websites, hadn't yet been erected.
*  Chinese citizens could access Facebook, Wikipedia, and Google somewhat freely, and the state
*  had yet to develop a robust mechanism to track sensitive words as a way to curb the spread
*  of inconvenient information.
*  By the end of the decade, scholars and writers debated public affairs on Weibo, a Twitter-like
*  platform.
*  Elsewhere, vibrant communities emerged around niche passions.
*  The poet who writes under the name Xiaoyin remembers the new poetry websites of that era
*  as chaotic and fun spaces.
*  On sites like Poetry Life, his peers quarreled daily over matters like the possibilities of
*  colloquial poetry writing.
*  Anyone could start their own bulletin boards, he told me.
*  It was like bandits occupying hills and claiming to be kings.
*  This Internet-based community constituted a sea change for Chinese literature.
*  Until the mid-1990s, jobs were assigned by the government.
*  For generations of writers, membership in the state-sponsored writers' association,
*  and staff jobs at party publications or state news agencies, were more or less the only path
*  to a career in letters.
*  Some of China's most prestigious novelists, like Yan Nian Kuh and Muoyen, known for their
*  realist novels about the village life of their youth, published their debuts while serving
*  in the People's Liberation Army.
*  It by the 2000s, such formal affiliations were no longer a prerequisite.
*  Anyone with a computer and an Internet connection could share his or her work on literary forums,
*  where censorship was nascent and piecemeal.
*  Free from the scrutiny of editors and censors, writers had a more direct relationship with
*  their readers, who relished their refreshingly unabashed accounts of their historical moment.
*  Following the differences between these generations to me over the phone, the celebrated novelist
*  who writes under the name Ayi borrowed concepts from classic martial arts stories.
*  Traditional writers, he told me, inhabit in Miyautang or temples and courts, whereas writers
*  of the Internet age inhabited Jianghu or the Unkempt Natural World.
*  Unburdened from the institutional gaze, they explored subjects and feelings that didn't
*  align with the state's values.
*  One essayist, writing under the name Mutsume, earned her reputation by publishing
*  sectionals, detailing her one-night stands and flirtatious encounters with rock stars
*  and other public figures.
*  If the era's cosmopolitanism was thrilling, it was also morally ambiguous.
*  Sometimes upward mobility could engender a spiritual hollowness.
*  Without the relative freedom that the open Internet provided, how might never have
*  started writing?
*  After testing into a university in Beijing and studying law, in 2000 he got a job in HR
*  at a cosmetics company and moved to the Southern Metropolis Shen Zhen, the heartland of Deng's
*  reforms.
*  When how became a writer, he was an untethered man.
*  His parents, who had been farmers in his rural home village, had both died by the time
*  he was in college.
*  He was briefly married in the late 1990s, but that relationship ended in divorce in 2000.
*  Browsing one of the literature bulletin boards, he came across a serialized novel titled
*  My Beijing, published under the pseudonym Drunken Fish.
*  The story of a group of friends finding their way in the rapidly growing and suddenly wealthy
*  capital inspired how to try his hand at a story that reflected his own time in China's
*  urban environments.
*  We wrote about the stories happening around us, our own anxieties, expectations, and sense
*  of rootlessness.
*  He told me.
*  Soon he had begun a novel about a recent university graduate in the Southwestern City
*  Changdu, navigating office politics and questioning his marriage.
*  By April 2002, he was posting chapters to several bulletin boards under his new pseudonym,
*  Mu Rong Shui Tsuen.
*  A name reminiscent of a hero in a martial arts novel.
*  Eventually titled, Leave Me Alone, the novel captured the hopes and delusions of recent
*  college graduates, who, like Howe, grew up in modest circumstances and now found themselves
*  surrounded by temptations of fast cash and meaningless sex.
*  Howe's depiction of Changdu's CD Underbelly became a sensation on forums like Tian Ya,
*  one of the period's largest blogging platforms.
*  Once, a colleague recommended the novel to Howe without knowing that he was Mu Rong Shui Tsuen.
*  Within two months, he was approached by booksellers and publishers, and the novel came out
*  that December.
*  He enjoyed the spoils of success, frequently treating friends to fancy dinners and letting
*  them borrow money when they needed it.
*  Beijing is divided into six concentric rings, radiating from downtown.
*  Generally speaking, the closer to downtown, the more prosperous the neighborhood.
*  By 2010, Howe lived in a penthouse in the Third Ring.
*  House fiction tended to explore imperfect protagonists, abuse of power, and the moral
*  corrosion of city life.
*  In his 2008 best-selling novel, Dancing Through Red Dust, the narrator, Wei Da, is a
*  well-connected partner at a law firm who moves with confidence through gambling dens
*  and corporate offices alike.
*  Wei comes from a simple family, but in a world where money keeps everything in motion
*  and compassion is weakness, his survival instincts and desire for influence overwhelm his
*  better nature.
*  In one scene, Wei runs over a poor farmer while driving drunk.
*  In the end, the farmer is forced to pay Wei for damaging his car.
*  House transition from a pulp fiction writer to a daring documentarian and critic of the
*  government was a natural progression.
*  From the get-go, he has been completely obsessed with how people are corrupted by the environment
*  in which they live, says Megan Walsh, author of The Subplot, a book about contemporary Chinese
*  literature.
*  When reading his work, she says, you come to believe that people can exist in and perpetuate
*  horrendous cycles of injustice.
*  Authorities mostly viewed how and other newcomers with suspicion.
*  At National Writers Association conferences, leaders urged literature workers to fight
*  against diversification of thought, ideas that subverted authoritarian patriarchal norms.
*  Later, at a propaganda meeting, the deputy party secretary of Chengdu criticized House
*  fiction for damaging the city's image.
*  A more correct, local performance artist, Li Boqing, accused how of failing to present
*  the city's mainstream features.
*  To him, Lee said in an interview, Chengdu was a beautiful, kind and tolerant mother,
*  who also has a graceful figure.
*  Disgusted by the lust and greed portrayed in Housework, Lee insisted that writers should
*  focus on the city's relaxing atmosphere, famed history of brocade production, and beautiful
*  Chinese hibiscus.
*  As how went through a political awakening, that distrust turned into persecution.
*  In 2011, how learned that his close friend Ran Yunfei, a scholar of classical Chinese,
*  was arrested and charged with subversion after he warned that if China didn't make reforms,
*  it risked an upheaval like the Jasmine Revolution protests in North Africa.
*  On way boy, where how had millions of followers, he denounced the arrest and called Ran the
*  conscience of the country.
*  Ran was released from detention that same year, but House encounter with state repression
*  radicalized him.
*  Still that point, I had enjoyed my life as a best-selling author and avoided getting
*  into trouble, he says.
*  But when their hands reached those close to me, I had to step up.
*  House writing steered to social commentary, and he began contributing to the international
*  New York Times.
*  The repercussions were swift.
*  How was banned from way boy, and before long it became clear that he was blacklisted.
*  In 2014, he started to receive invitations to tea, slang for informal police questioning.
*  In the next few years, he had tea about 40 times, as often as once a month.
*  Sometimes, as if they were old friends, officers would ask what how had been up to or what
*  he had been thinking about.
*  His writing career essentially came to an end.
*  He never published another book in China, and he made his living by ghost writing screenplays
*  for movies and TV shows.
*  When out of habit, he reached for the bill while out at dinner, friends dissuaded him and
*  insisted that he needed to think about his future.
*  By the time he left China, he had rented a studio apartment outside Beijing's fifth ring.
*  Thirty-six of his friends, writers, scholars, activists, and lawyers had been detained or
*  sentenced to prison.
*  Late at night, as he fell asleep, he wondered when his turn would come.
*  I didn't have long-term plans, he says, because I felt that I had one foot in prison already.
*  Under President Xi Jinping, who took office in 2013, the Communist Party has sought to assert
*  China's position as a rising global power.
*  Domestically, Xi's government has shown less tolerance for the kind of writing that
*  Dung's reforms fostered and has been keen on creating a centralized discourse that nurtures
*  national pride through an emphasis on telling China's story well.
*  A piece of ubiquitous political boilerplate that Xi introduced into the national consciousness.
*  In the spring of 2013, less than two months after Xi became president, state outlets reported
*  on a party-central document that instructed cadres to prioritize the struggles in the ideological
*  sphere, and to reinforce our management of propaganda on the cultural front, and cut off channels
*  of erroneous ideologies and speech at their headwaters.
*  This course correction was a tacit admission that Dung's opening up policy stoked growing
*  conversation about notions like feminism, queerness, and civil rights, and that their
*  discussion needed to be curbed.
*  To that end, the state has developed a robust surveillance and censorship apparatus.
*  The guabau, local police officers, publishing authorities and digital surveillance tools
*  are all mobilized into a multifaceted operation, whose purpose is to control China's story.
*  That machinery has transformed the internet from a place of experimentation into exhibit A of the
*  state's power. This often takes the form of a 404 error page. A notice that the state has deemed
*  an article or a piece of social media content unfit for public consumption. No one is immune.
*  In 2021, former prime minister Wen Jiabao published an essay remembering his mother,
*  writing that China should be a country full of justice and fairness.
*  On the popular social media app we chat, users couldn't share Wen's essay on their timelines
*  or private chats. She's approach has strangled free expression. According to Freedom House,
*  which surveys internet freedom around the world by tracking control measures,
*  the freedom of the Chinese internet has dropped by 40% since 2011.
*  And for the last eight years, China has earned the ignominious distinction of being the most
*  repressive among the countries that the organization monitors. In publishing, each new title
*  requires individual approval, which can result in an exhausting process. Once a publisher decides to
*  pursue a book proposal, it will be reviewed by in-house editors before they submit a request
*  to the National Administration of Press and Publication, which decides whether the idea will materialize.
*  In the last decade, the publication of new titles categorized as literary has decreased by 15%.
*  Seven out of ten literary titles published in 2013 were new works. By 2021, reprints made up half of
*  publications. In this environment of intense censorship and fractured cultural infrastructure,
*  writers must be flexible, willing to forego old forms and move fluidly among genres,
*  if they want to continue making meaningful work. Journalists become serial entrepreneurs,
*  who dream up new ways of creating to fill the lacunae they see. When one project becomes
*  infeasible, they move on to another. Zhang Wenmin, a veteran journalist who writes under the name
*  Jiang Xuye, became known for her coverage of a 2002 civil rights case, in which four policemen
*  showed up at a newlywed couples' home because they were watching porn. Among many colleagues,
*  there had been the consensus that no matter what, they had to try to say a little more. Zhang recalls.
*  Sensing increasing pressure, she quit institutional journalism in 2015 to become a self-publishing blogger.
*  With long straight hair, Zhang dresses simply. In contrast to the steely insistence on common sense
*  in her writing, there is a vulnerable shyness in her physical presence.
*  I've never been cool. She joked softly. Her arms draped in front of her body.
*  On WeChat, she wrote stories about dissidents. Something no news outlet would allow, she said,
*  because it's like violating a Tianjiao, a statute sent from heaven. She was uninvited from
*  journalism events. She lost her waybore and WeChat accounts, becoming virtually invisible.
*  Friends and family think I went too far, Zhang said. When her city, Xi'an, went into lockdown,
*  a friend offered her own WeChat account to publish Zhang's journals. They went viral,
*  but also drew attacks. The worsening media environment in the last 10 years makes people see
*  things upside down, she said. When you do the most normal thing, it appears abnormal.
*  Elsewhere, an even more bottom-up kind of writing community appeared. Its participants are
*  assisted by affordable technology. Three-quarters of the Chinese population are smartphone owners,
*  allowing a wider swath of people to publish more varieties of writing.
*  While House generation of writers was predominantly middle-class and upwardly mobile,
*  the spread of internet-enabled technology has allowed working-class people without
*  degrees to pursue literature. On social media platforms like Quai Shou,
*  where users post short video clips, factory workers, masseuses, and truck drivers started to
*  compose poems. In 2017, a 44-year-old single mother, Fan Yu Su, became a literary star almost
*  overnight after her autobiographical essay, I am Fan Yu Su, went viral on WeChat.
*  Beginning with a striking line, My Life is a Hard to Read book. Destiny bound me poorly.
*  It narrates her rural youth and eventual employment by an uber-rich, Beijing businessman,
*  who hires her to take care of the child he shares with a mistress. Six days a week,
*  she leaves her own daughters behind and attends to the love child. She started writing in her free
*  time because she thought, to live, you have to do something besides eating.
*  The journalist and editor Yang Ying has been a champion for overlooked stories and the
*  platforms that host them. She has managed to build a successful career, despite cycles of setback
*  and rebirth. A former reporter for a business weekly, she left that magazine in 2014 after
*  growing dissatisfied with conventional media. Along with a couple of other editors, she started a
*  popular digital outlet whose name translates to Curiosity Daily, that covered subjects like the
*  Shanghai Pride Parade, a Texan who moved into a dumpster for a year to explore sustainable living,
*  and the work of the Japanese otur Hirokazukurae da, who once commented that creators should
*  keep influence of the state at bay. After the authorities suspended the outlet twice for illegally
*  building a news gathering and editing team, the outfit dissolved in 2019. Yang persisted,
*  following that project with a digital magazine called Xiao Niao or Little Birds, in which she published
*  literary writing on subjects that could no longer be explored in journalism.
*  Literature is our last refuge. Yang told me,
*  in stories, people can communicate with one another.
*  Zhang Jieping, a journalist turned media entrepreneur and founder of the fellowship Zai Chang,
*  or on the scene, told me, their joys and sadness become relatable.
*  With today's news outlets, it's increasingly hard to achieve that.
*  As journalism institutions collapsed, Zhang built Zai Chang to create a community and a ladder
*  for aspiring journalists to learn to tell such stories. Editors like Yang and Zhang want to
*  correct that dearth of connection by normalizing what Yang called, everyday messiness.
*  Topics that the state considers counterproductive, like disappearing traditional villages,
*  and the rising diagnosis of anxiety in the aftermath of disasters.
*  In Xi's China, though, publishing this work means courting unwanted attention.
*  During Shanghai's COVID lockdown, Xiao Niao published a special edition that collected haunting
*  real stories, including one about a young woman who evaded the rules to cross the city to see
*  her critically ill father. Soon, Yang was treated to tea by her local police.
*  Apparently swamped with tea appointments, they asked her to remove the entire issue from the
*  publication's mobile app. She complied. Without public distribution channels, the special issue of
*  Xiao Niao lives as a PDF passed around among friends. I have no idea how far it has reached,
*  Yang said. There is something Sami's dot like to it, she said, referring to the underground literature
*  of 20th century Eastern Europe, which circulated hand to hand. In today's China, people create
*  knowing that publishing is transient in nature. Online articles can be taken down.
*  Books can be removed from the shelves. Writers can be blacklisted. Bloggers can be
*  disappeared. One of the websites, Xiao Yin, frequented, Poetry Life, announced it shut down on
*  July 13th. Poetry Life was born on the internet where it will dissipate. The announcement read,
*  it has been a mirage as well as our real land. Yet many people go on writing in whatever
*  capacity they can manage. If the goal was to escape censorship, then we wouldn't be in this business,
*  Yang said. They focus instead on creating a new possibility of public writing, a vibrant,
*  breathing thing. Here people are quick to forget, she said. Sometimes they are forced to forget.
*  Other times new events overwrite the old before you know it. It's like we live in an environment
*  where people can't keep going if they don't learn to forget. She paused to search for the precise
*  words. Literature is a good way to help people remember things. Earlier this year,
*  Zheng Wenmin and Hao were introduced by mutual friends and met while they were each traveling.
*  Pondering her future, Zheng was both curious about and daunted by the examples of how
*  and other expatriate writers. At a dinner with other Chinese writers, she spoke almost to herself.
*  How does a writer come to accept their status of exile?
*  In Melbourne, how is curious about his new surroundings? Every experience presents opportunities
*  for discoveries. After contracting COVID and speaking with a public health official on the phone,
*  he was prescribed free medication. Isn't this socialism? He wondered. He went to observe a
*  local election and chatted with people outside. It's eye-opening, he says. There is a party representing
*  sex workers. There is also a party for animal rights. How is eager to master his new language,
*  but is baffled by the choice of other exiled writers, like the late Milan Cundera,
*  to abandon their mother tongues in their work? The act of writing, of making sense of one's experiences,
*  is so bound up in the language a person speaks, along with all the little intricacies and
*  inexplicable imagery within it. To abandon it is almost like abandoning yourself. He told me the story
*  behind his favorite Chinese phrase, Huang Liang Yimong, or a fleeting dream as the golden millet cooks.
*  It refers to a story in which a young man falls asleep at an inn as the innkeeper
*  steams a pot of millet. In his dream, the man marries a beautiful woman from a wealthy family,
*  rises to power in court politics and narrowly escapes death after jealous rivals set him up.
*  After a lifetime, he wakes up. The millet isn't done yet. Which is the reality?
*  Eventless destitution or surreal splendor punctuated by viciousness?
*  How has readily joined a growing community of Chinese activists and writers in exile?
*  As the environment grows dire, he wrote to Zhang on signal, the encrypted messaging service.
*  We are a generation that's destined to be uprooted and scattered, to drift through the world.
*  Privately though, how is still processing the past? Since self-exiling, how has experienced a measure
*  of survivor's guilt? His tally of arrested friends has risen to 41. Last fall, when thousands of
*  citizens protested the arbitrary COVID policies, how had an intense feeling of missing out?
*  One day, perhaps, he thought, he would decide to return home as abruptly as he left.
*  In his early essays, how depicted himself to be a somewhat feeble man? When he encountered
*  physical conflict in the streets, he tended to avert his eyes and avoid getting involved.
*  It's different, however, when the conflict is intellectual. He finds himself oscillating between
*  wary caution and reckless bravery. He cannot stomach the government's authoritarian grip on China's
*  literary culture and public life. Who gives you the right to rule this way? He wondered aloud.
*  Last year, how began writing fiction again at the age of 48? He is in the middle of a new novel he
*  is calling Homeless Dog. The working title is inspired by a friend's experience during a T-Session
*  when a guabao officer scolded him. Don't fancy yourself to be some kind of big figure. To me,
*  you are merely a homeless dog. Seen in this light, the title poses a question.
*  Who gets to define writers like how? I had to make many difficult choices, but I'm proud of the
*  life I lived. How says? In May, he was touring for his Wuhan book in Norway. In drizzling rain,
*  on a train passing through unfamiliar cities, he dozed. A dream came. He was 18 again and about to
*  take the college entrance exam. He was feeling unprepared. He woke up feeling jittery.
*  Then remembered that the old days are long gone. He is far from home.
*  He was a young man. He was a young man. He was a young man. He was a young man. He was a young man.
