# Introducing ‘The Interview’: Anne Hathaway Is Done Trying to Please
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwnCh8GhIuw)
*  Hey, it's Michael. Just want to let you know what we're up to this weekend in The Daily
*  Feed. Our colleagues have been working on a brand new show, one that they're calling
*  simply The Interview. It'll be hosted some weeks by Lulu Garcia Navarro. You may know
*  her from the show First Person or from NPR. Other weeks, it'll be hosted by David Marchese,
*  who's been doing a terrific interview feature for The Times Magazine over the past few years.
*  On the show, David and Lulu will be interviewing all kinds of interesting people. Actors,
*  politicians, writers. We're not going to spill too many details right now, but we can
*  say their opening line-up looks fantastic. That includes this weekend when they're
*  launching the show. David is speaking with the actress Anne Hathaway. Lulu is speaking
*  with Yair Lapid, the leader of the opposition party in Israel. So this weekend, we're
*  going to bring you both of those shows. And then in the following weeks, we'll be sharing
*  every episode here on Saturday in The Daily Feed. Okay, here's one of the first episodes
*  of The Interview. David speaking with Anne Hathaway. Take a listen.
*  This is The Interview, a new show from The New York Times. I'm David Marchese. On one
*  level, Anne Hathaway's new movie, The Idea of You, couldn't be more straightforward.
*  It's an adaptation of a novel about a woman who winds up in a relationship with a much
*  younger singer in a boy band. The movie's an update of the kinds of movies that Hathaway
*  was known for earlier in her career. Movies like The Princess Diaries and The Devil Wears
*  Prada. These were movies where young women find themselves in entirely new situations
*  and have to adapt to high pressure and glamorous worlds. The twist for the new movie, though,
*  is that Hathaway's playing a 40 year old divorced mom. So she's coming in a little
*  less starry eyed about the whole thing. But The Idea of You also works on another more
*  complicated, I think you could even say meta level. It's a movie about women pushing against
*  societal expectations of them and getting hate for it. And that is something Hathaway
*  knows a bit about. A decade ago, around the time she won an Oscar for Les Miserables,
*  the internet turned on Anne Hathaway. People decided inexplicably that she was an inauthentic
*  striver or something like that. And the unfair backlash earned a nickname of its own. Hathahate,
*  you might remember it. And it makes even less sense to me now than it did then. But as Hathaway
*  told me, for her the past decade has been about letting go of people's opinions and
*  expectations, including those of interviewers like me. But that hasn't made her any less
*  fun to talk to. In some ways, it's made her more interesting than ever. And I think a
*  great guest for my first episode. Here's my interview with Anne Hathaway.
*  Hi guys.
*  Nice to meet you. I'm David.
*  Nice to meet you, David. I'm Annie.
*  Okay, so there are a bunch of things that are intriguing to me about the new movie.
*  kind of an interesting way that there are a few little, what I took to be like Anne
*  Hathaway psychological Easter eggs sprinkled throughout the film. And I'll get to those.
*  But first, you haven't done a romance in really kind of a while, I think it was, you know,
*  since the days of one day and love and other drugs, more than 10 years ago now. So just
*  just start, can you talk to me about why you wanted to do this movie?
*  It's such a softball question, and I can feel my brain complicating it.
*  I want you to go as complicated as you can make it.
*  Sorry, everybody. I'm still I'm if you can believe it, after all of these years, I'm
*  I always still find it so much more natural to express my thoughts and my feelings through
*  characters and through the story. So part of me just wants to be like, well, just see
*  the movie. That's why I wanted to make it. But then I realized that I should probably
*  be able to describe it. So this is a movie about a woman healing her heart after a massive
*  trust trauma. And it says that a bloom can happen in a person's life at any stage. And
*  I really found myself almost possessed with the need to explore what those two things
*  meant and looked like.
*  So I'm now curious about kind of the nature of that possession that you just described.
*  Was it about like an abstract level? Or did you find it connected to something about you
*  in a more direct way?
*  Oh, it's completely direct.
*  So tell me about that.
*  Absolutely. It was totally direct. Well, I think that my character, Solemn Marchand,
*  she might not seem like, I don't know, the most complicated character I've ever played.
*  There's no accents. There's no particular gate. I love it. I love a character's gate.
*  But what she had going for her, she felt familiar. She felt like people I know. I recognized
*  aspects of myself in her. I recognize aspects of my friends or women I admire. My friends
*  are women I admire. That sounded awful. But the thing about her was she had a richness
*  to her, which combined with this idea that early in her life, she'd been a people pleaser.
*  I was so excited by that idea of somebody arriving at a place in their life where they've
*  grown out of that phase.
*  I'm so glad you brought up that people pleaser line because that was one of the Easter eggs.
*  Okay.
*  A people pleaser from New Jersey.
*  Yes.
*  But before I get into that, you know, the my vote for best Anne Hathaway character gate,
*  Dark Knight.
*  Thank you very, very much.
*  So much swagger.
*  Thank you very much. I worked with a choreographer for three weeks to find that swagger.
*  Really?
*  Yes, I did. Because I just felt like I didn't have an, oh, this is going to sound like a
*  really weird sentence, but I wasn't connected enough to my hips. And I just kept imagining,
*  you know, a cat's movements and the way it's very fluid and swishy, but also very strong
*  and very purposeful. And they helped me find my hips.
*  I think you need to introduce me to that choreographer because not being connected enough to my hips,
*  I think describes most of my life problems for the last 42 years, but maybe she can help.
*  We are going to follow up because I have so many thoughts because I didn't feel connected
*  to my body early on in my life. And it was kind of this weird thing. Like you don't know
*  how to do it. And that's something that it's this amazing gift that acting has given me
*  is that you always have to think about how you move, how your character moves. And eventually
*  you just kind of get to understand movement.
*  Why weren't you connected to your body?
*  That's a great question. And we don't have, I mean, it would take me 41 years to answer
*  that. It's genuinely so many things, but I think I probably just needed, I think it's
*  just assumed that we have a relationship with our body like you. Like you, you, you, like
*  something you know about yourself is that you do not have a relationship with your hips.
*  Not a good one.
*  But if somebody said, here's a path for you to have one, what would you do?
*  That is, oh boy, I don't know how to answer that question. Let's move on.
*  Okay.
*  But I want to go back to the people pleaser line.
*  Okay.
*  I interpreted the inclusion of the line, a people pleaser from New Jersey as pretty intentional.
*  Can you talk to me about why that line is in there?
*  Well, she had to be from somewhere. And yeah, so I think it might've been me who suggested
*  that line, maybe, possibly.
*  Am I wrong in interpreting that line self referentially? Like you are a people pleaser
*  from New Jersey, right?
*  I think I'm a former people pleaser from New Jersey. Yeah, I think I absolutely was. I
*  absolutely was. It was again, to me, so much of the reason why I was drawn to acting was
*  because it was an outlet for expression that I could not find on my own. And sort of in
*  the space between feeling so connected when I was acting and so lost when I wasn't, you
*  sort of try to make your way. And one of the ways that you make your way is like, oh, if
*  I do this and that'll make someone else happy, and maybe that's what I'm supposed to be doing.
*  And it takes a really long time to go, well, it doesn't really matter if you don't know
*  who you are, unless you just want an identity that's all about pleasing people, which I
*  suppose is perfectly valid as well. But I'm not that nice.
*  I'm curious about when that shift from people pleaser to former people pleaser started to
*  happen because it was interesting for me to revisit a lot of your work and see in a bunch
*  of roles what I took to be kind of, and I don't mean this in a condescending way at all, but sort
*  of like an eager beaver quality. I'm thinking of things like the devil wears Prada or in some
*  ways Princess Diaries, or I think your character in Valentine's Day had that sort of, or in a
*  slightly spikier way, maybe the intern had that. So I'm interested in knowing about how that
*  quality might have affected the work you did at a certain part of your career, and if that was
*  something you consciously then tried to change. I was not aware of it until this conversation.
*  But yeah, I do think that there's a thread that runs through those characters about someone
*  who is trying to do something that they might not be altogether comfortable with, but they
*  think is the right thing to do. And the thing that I was so interested about Solenne was this
*  idea that turning 40 and knowing who she was, definitely in a professional sense, definitely
*  knowing who she is as a mother, but not necessarily having given herself full freight to explore
*  aspects of herself just as a person. You just referenced another key emotional
*  throughline of the film, which is the entering middle age aspect. And obviously 40 years old is
*  a real milestone for a lot of people, a lot of women. But there's also something weird about our
*  cultural fixation on the arbitrary age of 40 years old. And I'm just curious how you think about
*  entering middle age, given that it is or can be a fraught thing, particularly for people in your
*  line of work, but also understanding that it is kind of a somewhat arbitrary fixation for people.
*  So serious. I don't take it that seriously. I got to be honest. There are so many other things that
*  I identify as milestones. I don't normally talk about it, but I am over five years sober.
*  That feels like a milestone to me. 40 feels like a gift. The fact of the matter is I hesitate
*  at calling things middle age simply because I can be a little bit of a semantic stickler.
*  And technically I could get hit by a car later today. I really hope it doesn't happen.
*  And so we don't know if this is middle age. We don't know anything. So I like to connect to it
*  in that way. I don't think this is breaking news. I'm a nerd. So I love learning. I am so into
*  learning. And I just kind of like, I don't know. That's what I focus on. I just focus on, oh my
*  God, I get to learn something today, hopefully. You know what you said about the semantics of
*  using the term middle aged when we don't really know or we can't know actually where in our
*  lifespan we are. This made me sound totally like a new agey ding dong. But I think-
*  Get there. Go there. Come on. Let's go. Let's bring it out. Where are your crystals?
*  I've got incense burning on my side. Let's do this.
*  What you said is exactly right. That if we can't take for granted how much life we have left,
*  but actually internalizing that so that we can treat each day and moment like it could be the
*  last, which would be the most powerful change we could make in our lives is also like maybe the
*  hardest thing to actually do. Yeah. Well, one of the things that I think about a lot is because I
*  lived in a stressful place for many years. And when you talk about like those performances,
*  a key element to all of them, I think, is that they're really stressed out young women.
*  I was a really stressed out young woman. And as a formerly chronically stressed young woman,
*  which leads to all manner of things, I just remember thinking like one day,
*  you are taking this for granted. You are taking your life for granted. You have no idea.
*  Something could fall through the sky and that will be lights out for you. So when I find myself
*  the old instincts rising, I just tell myself, I'm like, you are not going to die stressed.
*  It's a small question, but maybe invites a big answer. What were you so stressed about?
*  I didn't know how to breathe yet. And that was really complicated. That was really,
*  really complicated not knowing how to breathe. I mean, you're right. You're right. It's actually
*  too big an answer. And the simple answer is just like literally everything.
*  Yeah. Because I was stressed. I was just very, very, very in my head about a lot of things.
*  I guess maybe that's the easiest way to put it.
*  Yeah. It's interesting that your first answer to that question was about breathing.
*  And earlier you alluded to not feeling comfortable in your body. Those are two somatic things. You
*  must've felt very alienated from your body. I love that you just identified it as somatic. I think
*  it feels a little too exposed to discuss the alienation I felt from my body.
*  You know, all of that thing. But I think there was a lot of somatic stress there.
*  Was drinking a way of dealing with that?
*  Probably.
*  Yeah. Fair enough.
*  Let me ask you a goofier question now. Okay?
*  Okay.
*  And then I'm going to circle back to have your stuff again. But the plot of the film
*  turns on a trip to Coachella. Have you ever been to the festival?
*  I have been to Coachella.
*  Tell me about your experiences there.
*  Paul McCartney was the headliner. So it was magical. You just go and you see these acts and
*  you're just kind of like drifting in and out of waves of people. And it's a fun thing to do. I
*  feel like everybody should go and kind of have their own experience. I don't know. It's probably
*  very different now.
*  I think I went the same year that Paul McCartney was there. That was probably 2010 or 2012.
*  Nine-ish? Yeah. Something like that.
*  Yeah. Can I tell you a very quick Coachella story?
*  It can even be long.
*  I don't want to take up our short time with a long Coachella story. But I used to work for music
*  magazines. We used to have to go and cover this stuff. So one year it was too hot. I didn't have
*  enough water. I was drinking beer all day, taking other stuff. And really by the end of the day,
*  I was so fried and physically uncomfortable.
*  You were so tweaked out. Oh no, that's a bad combination.
*  I was like, I got to get out of here. And we had a plan that at 1130 we'd all meet in the
*  press area and then someone would drive us back to our hotel. But I thought, I can't wait till then.
*  I just got to get out of here. So I thought I'll walk back to our hotel. This is the state of mind
*  I was in. Probably the hotel was like, Oh my God, you thought you were going to walk back? No.
*  15 miles or whatever in the desert at night. So I just left the festival. And within about
*  10 minutes, I realized I'm lost in the desert. I'm so stressed and worried for you right now.
*  No cars are coming by. I don't know where I am. My mind is totally foggy. But somehow I'm going to
*  die on the highway trying to walk back to my hotel. And then after some period of time,
*  a car pulls up and it's my coworkers come to save me. They rescued you. I get in the car and I was
*  like, Oh, thank God. I've been here forever. I didn't know what I was going to do. And then
*  he looks at the clock and then looks behind him. Literally like 22 minutes had passed.
*  I was like an eighth of a mile away from the, I was not at risk of dying. But it felt to you,
*  those 22 minutes. Longest 22 minutes of my life. Oh my gosh. Well, I'm so happy everything went
*  okay. Thank you. But yeah, no, Coachella is very dehydrating. Very dehydrating. Yeah.
*  You know, I feel like I have sort of danced around this question a couple of times, but to me,
*  the most interesting thing about people is when they change, you know, when they were one thing
*  and they become another thing. And I'm wondering if you can tell me a little more about the change
*  that I think I'm hearing in you sort of implicitly from kind of like a stressed out, knotted up person
*  who's in you, in your words, in her own head to the person you are now.
*  Uh, change is certainly a word that applies. Another word is, um, I don't like this word
*  because I think it's often misunderstood. So maybe I shouldn't even say it, but I'd love to explore
*  it with you if you want to explore it. Settles. I think settling often has a negative connotation,
*  but actually like to me, when settle becomes beautiful is like that concept of surrender.
*  And I think gratitude is really crucial to it. And I don't want to go into specifics too much
*  just because I like to keep my personal things personal, but there was a moment in my life where
*  I don't know, do you ever have this feeling where you feel like you have like yourself in the future,
*  like that your best possible choice, turn around and guide you. Now I'm sounding very New Age.
*  Now I'm sounding very New Age. Explain to me more what you mean.
*  Well, I was just stuck in this feeling and I've been stuck in a feeling for a while. And it's
*  that thing about, I want to achieve things. I want to grow. I want to do these things. And I think
*  you think mistakenly that the way that you do that is you're really hard on yourself.
*  And, um, you drive yourself by self-criticism, by telling yourself you're not enough. And I,
*  I just, I won't go into the specifics of it, but there was a moment in which I just realized
*  that in order to keep that narrative alive, I was going to have to deny so much. And there was just
*  something about that. There was something about me being aware that in order to keep up this
*  narrative, which by the way, I didn't feel like I was improving anymore. I feel like I'd strongly
*  movement and strongly plateaued. And I just said, you're going to have to accept, you're just going
*  to have to accept that if nothing else happens to you, you've had a really great life. And it felt
*  like, I don't know, it just felt like a light one on, you know, what else is something that I find.
*  Interesting is not the right word, but, um, or a realization I had about sort of motivating
*  yourself through negativity is that, uh, you never get to the bottom of it. You know, it's like,
*  you can just keep getting more and more negative. And it's not like you ever hit some
*  rock bottom or like, okay, now I can be pot. It's just, it's an endless. Yeah. Yeah.
*  That resonates. You described yourself as a person who wants to achieve things.
*  Yeah. What are the things that you want to achieve? Like what are the ambitions now?
*  I don't, I don't feel comfortable getting too specific. I think it just comes from, uh,
*  being raised in a superstitious household. I think that, um, again, I feel,
*  I don't know, honestly, I don't really want to say it because I just feel like, uh,
*  they feel great to me and I worry if I shared them and they got shredded.
*  I don't want to feel bad about them. I actually feel really great about them. So, uh, but I just
*  think that just acknowledging that you are someone who is ambitious, acknowledging that
*  you are someone who, yeah, I do want to achieve things, but I'd say that like my ambition right
*  now is to do all of that and really, really be a nurturing presence in people's lives as well.
*  This is another one of the potential Easter eggs or sort of self referential lines that I thought
*  I picked up in the film. Okay. And the reason I'm thinking about it now is because when I asked you
*  about ambitions, you said you don't necessarily want to put it out there because if it got
*  shredded, it would make you feel bad about it. Yeah. Um, and there are a couple points
*  points in the film where, you know, there are references to your character being
*  picked apart on the internet. Um, and did your experience going through that,
*  and you know, a decade plus ago, inform the character?
*  Yes. Can you tell me in what ways? Not really. It's in the phone.
*  Oh, Fooey.
*  Sorry. Uh, just, just, just, uh, look, what I can tell you is that from personal experience,
*  I knew that everything we were saying was true. You know, it happens. Yeah. I can't believe I just
*  on the record said Fooey. Fooey. Oh. Fooey. Ohounts done. Um, I just read this great,
*  great, great list of Victorian, like common Victorian expressions that are so literal and
*  filthy. And I, I can only think of one right now that I couldn't possibly say. Wait, tell me off
*  the record, off the record. Off the record. It's filthy. Um, so we're back on the record.
*  And for the record, uh, we laughed heartily. Yes. Yeah. And Heather was at a very inappropriate
*  thing. It was the Victorians. I was simply, I was just repeating Victorian slang. Yes. Uh,
*  it was a conversation, uh, furthering the idea of semantics. Uh, um, uh, it, uh,
*  that's such a funny way of putting it. Excuse me. So clearly at a couple different times in
*  this conversation, I've tried to create a through line or an arc to your career.
*  You know, where I was saying, it seemed like you did this here or like this happened at this point
*  and how does that sort of affect things now? Do you see a through line or a particular arc
*  to your career? I'm not terribly reflective. I like to look towards the horizon that's coming at me
*  rather than look back at what I've done. Like I don't watch my films. Uh, I'm not sitting around
*  having marathons. It's so sweet. I get texts from friends and, and from people and like, like I was
*  just on a plane the other day and they were like, Oh my God, I watched Devil Wears Prada last night.
*  And so like people, I know I love that. I'm so many of my movies are the films that you cuddle
*  up with, you know, and I do know that I do. I'm aware of that aspect of it, but in terms of like
*  the concept of having, first of all, the concept of having a name is so weird, a name that people
*  recognize. It's like, I always think about the least likely things that could happen to you as
*  an actor. And one of them is that you have a name that people actually know. So the idea of having
*  a name that signifies something that could qualify as having an Easter egg, it's just, it's, it's no,
*  that's not a concept that I think about a lot. I guess my question was whether a different kind
*  of role than the ones we talked about earlier in the conversation started to appeal to you
*  more or speak to you more at this stage of your career.
*  No, I've always loved spiky, difficult women. Always. That's kind of, you know, you have to
*  understand that when I was 23 years old and made a film with Jonathan Demme called Rachel Getting
*  Married. And when I was, Oh, but before that, when I was 21 years old, I got to make a film with Ang Lee
*  called Brokeback Mountain. And so I do think that my, I'm lucky enough to say that within my
*  filmography, there has always been both. And I think that the last 10 to 12 years has been a less
*  romantic era. So I just kind of assumed that that was done and that kind of phase of my career was
*  over. And so then to find something that actually said, nah, it's not over. And why would you think
*  that it needed to be? That was really cool to me. Is anything cooking with a Princess Diaries three?
*  Yep. I know the answer, but could you tell me more about that? I don't think it would be nice.
*  There you go. So, you know, I don't want you to think you're trapped here. I think we're about
*  done with the time that I've been. I'm not trapped. If you're okay to go a little longer,
*  I can leave this dinner party at any time. No, which is a great line, which have you read the
*  book Acts of Service? No, what is it? It's a spicy book. But anyway, that's a great line in it where
*  a character finds herself exploring a situation that is uncomfortable, but really tantalizing to
*  her. And she keeps thinking of this line that she's learned either through a short story or
*  not quite sure where that I can leave this dinner party at any time I want. And so I always think
*  that so I often don't feel trapped. Wait, does that mean you find this conversation
*  uncomfortable, but tantalizing? I'm just finding this conversation really lovely.
*  Oh, good. I'm uncomfortable sometimes just because I think you want me to reveal personal
*  things. And I'm just allergic to that. But I think that we're having a wonderful time anyway.
*  Yeah. You know, it's such an interesting thing where in an ideal world, I always want people to
*  be as personal as possible. But I also fully understand that that's something that someone
*  might not want to do. And that's okay. I just also find it really hard to imagine that people
*  are interested. I cannot believe that people are so interested in the sound of my voice
*  and what my brain has. I just have a hard time making that leap. But then you've also had the
*  experience of people not being nice to you. So I totally, I fully understand that it's not as
*  straightforward as I'm making it out to be. No, no, but it also is. And you're right. And 100%.
*  And again, it's just hard for me to imagine. I find it hard to imagine that people would be
*  interested in me. That's just a part that I just haven't arrived at yet. And that's one of the
*  reasons why I don't know that I'm a very good celebrity in that because I don't really know
*  where the walls are between when it becomes, when just being personal and just being intimate,
*  just letting intimate details out. I don't know where the wall between that and narcissism and
*  that and self-regard. And I think I'm a little, because of what I went through, I'm sensitive
*  to the way it can come across. And so I would rather be cautious. But then the odd thing is,
*  is that as soon as you stop recording this, all the details you want, literally, I don't hold back.
*  Just because it feels like, okay, but now it's contained, now it's safe. But in under these
*  things, I think I'm probably not the best interview.
*  To that end, we're going to talk again for a much shorter period in about a week and a half,
*  something like that. And you could say, you know, you were wrong about all that.
*  I love the marination time in between. I think that's funny enough, really essential to any kind
*  of long form conversation. Cool. Thank you very much for taking all the time to talk with me
*  today. I appreciate it. Take care. Bye bye. Bye bye.
*  After the break, I give Ann a call back and the interview gets a little more meta.
*  A part of me just kind of resists the form of this.
*  Yeah. Well, it's a totally arbitrary and weird. Yeah.
*  And also just slightly rude.
*  Welcome back to the interview. I'm David Marchese.
*  Hi, David. Hi.
*  Hi. I'm so sorry to be a couple of minutes late. My espresso machine was betraying me.
*  That's totally okay. How are you? I mean, I think I'm caffeinated enough now, but I'm,
*  I'm all right. I'm all right. I am curious, because I have a hunch that maybe you're
*  a ruminator. Is there anything about our conversation to this point that you've
*  been thinking about? Well, I had a slight word choice. The worst moment. Where you asked me
*  what my goals are coming up and I kind of decided not to share them. And the reason I gave was
*  because I'd rather not have them shredded. And that just seemed a little harsh. And I just
*  regretted that. And how would you rephrase it?
*  I think I would rephrase it just saying it's too tender.
*  Yeah. That is very different than shredded. Yeah.
*  Yeah. It's just kind of like, I don't, you know, and it's just kind of
*  little bit less self-important. Do you think it's telling that your mind
*  initially went to shredded? Oh yeah. I think that's the scar tissue.
*  I understand why I said it, but also it's not actually reflective of how I feel.
*  Right. It's reflective of what I fear, but not what I feel.
*  I think we're going to get back to that. But before then, something that I wanted to return to was,
*  what are the things that used to stress you out so much, or that would make you be in your own head?
*  Because it's something that you've referred to a couple of times and how you're not stressed out
*  about those things anymore or less in your head about them. I'm just trying to make it a little
*  more tangible. Like, are you able to articulate what's in those?
*  My goal is to heal it and not relive it. So I'm not trying to be evasive. It's just,
*  I don't really spend a great deal of time thinking about it because I feel like I found a window
*  and I climbed through it. And I work very hard to just be really present here.
*  I think I'm, like I said, I'm more grateful. I'm more settled in myself. I'm less afraid of
*  things not happening. The time in which I was an emerging adult,
*  it was a different time. We weren't having the conversations that we were having now. So I think
*  a lot of me, a lot of my thoughts felt very under expressed. So I don't know if it's more
*  curiosity in the world or maybe we have this shared language now that feels more gentle.
*  I feel that there's greater curiosity now. Unless harshness, at least in my personal experience.
*  My God, that was such a long answer. Excuse me.
*  It's groping in the dark.
*  That's all we're ever doing is groping in the dark. Can I tell you maybe what's a
*  blindingly obvious realization about my own hypocrisy?
*  Oh my God, that's so deep. Tell me everything.
*  It's not that deep. But I realize when I'm asking you to make things more tangible or
*  asking follow-ups that are entreaties to give me more detail or go deeper,
*  I'm just thinking about that in the light of the little exchange that we had about hips
*  remember that? And you asked me a question and I really got like the,
*  you know, it was almost like the visceral heebie-jeebies. I thought about that.
*  I'm not talking about that.
*  No.
*  And then I thought, gosh, that must be what it feels like for you. Every time I ask a question
*  asking you to go deeper, is the feeling that I had the feeling that you have all the time
*  doing these kinds of things?
*  Heebie-jeebies. Does it give me the heebie-jeebies?
*  It makes me, you know what it does? It just puts me in a defensive position.
*  And not in defensive in the sense that I feel attacked, but defensive in the sense that
*  it's really hard to say something revealing with a tape recorder there.
*  And so I just feel like I become a more self-conscious, a more neutral version of
*  myself. Like I watch other actresses and they're so free and they're so off the cuff and they just,
*  not that they're more revealing, they're just, I don't know, maybe I don't even have a word for it.
*  But anyway, so I don't get the heebie-jeebies, but I don't know that this is,
*  like I won't take pauses like this to consider my words that much if we were just having coffee and
*  there wasn't a tape recorder, you know? Yeah.
*  I just don't think people are, we don't usually ask people such direct questions. Like that's just
*  not the way conversations are usually built. Normally trust is established each by sharing
*  something about ourselves and you build up a mutual understanding of each other.
*  And so a part of me just kind of resists the form of this.
*  Yeah. Well, it's a totally arbitrary and weird. Yeah.
*  But it also just slightly rude.
*  But that's just me and I just need to, I just kind of need to work on accepting,
*  like I said, that this is just the way this is built.
*  Well, you know, I definitely heard you when you said, you know, you're more comfortable sort of
*  talking about and through your characters and talking about yourself. But, you know, as someone
*  who has my job and as someone who's interested in the person and the life that animates the work,
*  I'm of course curious about you and what it's like to be you.
*  And that interest is, you know, it's obviously rooted in an assumption that who you are is
*  meaningful to audiences or fans, you know, that the idea that they have some understanding of
*  you outside your work matters in some way. Do you think that matters?
*  I think I understand the question that my life is somehow as interesting as my work.
*  Or just that people having an understanding of who you are outside of the work is in some way
*  meaningful. Just trying to think if it's meaningful to me with other people.
*  Yeah. I don't know, do you ever have the experience that sometimes you just want to watch a film in
*  another language because you're less familiar with the personal life of the actor and it just
*  lets you get lost in the story? I know what you mean, yeah.
*  So, pardon me, I would rather, I don't know, it's kind of strange, but like I just,
*  I don't want to distract from it all. Also, going back to the thing before about direct questions
*  and, you know, getting where I get the heebie-jeebies and all that, I'm just very protective
*  and I don't ever want to be, I worry about like other people and the way the press can be
*  opportunistic because I can have a perfectly lovely respectful conversation with you.
*  And then to have something that is real and meaningful and personal and to like watch it
*  get filtered through all the different levels of media until it like arrives at the tabloid version.
*  It just kind of makes you never want to say anything that could be, I'm going to use a big
*  word and it's probably an unwise word to use, but that can be weaponized against the actor.
*  Like I have like this awesome story about Nick that I want to tell and it's like on the tip
*  of my tongue right now, but I don't want to tell it because I haven't asked him if it's cool.
*  You're a co-star in the film, yeah.
*  Yes. And I'm just aware that he'd have to answer questions about it for the next
*  three months to 30 years.
*  Like the way that I'm sure somewhat annoyingly you're still being asked
*  questions, including by me about bad experiences you had on the internet a lifetime ago.
*  No, no, I don't find you annoying. I value what you do and just because I'm not the most
*  innately forthcoming person doesn't mean I don't think that this is a wonderful
*  forum in a lot of ways. And yeah, I'm just amazed by people who can just express themselves.
*  I'm amazed by them.
*  Well, you just express yourself in different ways.
*  I really love expressing myself through my characters. I really,
*  really do. I kind of also, I think, no, nevermind.
*  The most telling Anne Hathaway you know, I think nevermind, bingo.
*  Give me another 25 years. Maybe I'll relax a little bit more.
*  I'll get back in touch then.
*  I do want to end on something fun though.
*  Tell me a funny story.
*  This didn't happen on set, but I can tell you something. When I was making the idea of you,
*  I was very lefty, so spoiled staying in a beautiful house in Atlanta, Georgia,
*  that was much larger than my needs. So I would get home from work and I'd be in this
*  house by myself. And I was just like, and it was just, that was giving me the heebie-jeebies.
*  And I was trying to figure out like, what was like, why was I feeling this so intensely?
*  And I realized there was no laughter in the house.
*  And when you have a big house like that, you need laughter.
*  And so I started to listen to stand-up specials and I got really into Adam Sandler's 100% Fresh.
*  Ah.
*  And I think that Adam Sandler is as extraordinary, beloved and iconic as Adam Sandler is,
*  I think he's underappreciated. I think he's such a stealth genius. I have that kind of level of
*  just appreciation for him. I can quote you every single line from Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore.
*  I'm the wedding singer. I'm a big fan.
*  I'm going to put your feet to the fire. Let's trade Sandler lines. I'll go first from his movies.
*  Piece of shit like you for breakfast.
*  You eat pieces of shit for breakfast?
*  You got it.
*  Hold on. No, no, then the best follow-up ever.
*  If pee in my pants is cool, then I'm Miles Davis.
*  Or call me Miles Davis. I think that's a good idea.
*  Okay. Okay. Okay. Shampoo is better. I go on first and leave the hair clean.
*  No, conditioner is better. I leave the hair silky and smooth. Oh, really? Hold on. Wait for it.
*  Stop looking at me, Schwann.
*  Very good. Very good. You know, I feel bad. I'm just taking up your time now just jabbering
*  about Adam Sandler. So this is the part that I'm talking about. Like I feel much more comfortable
*  talking about Adam Sandler, who I've never met, than I do like talking about what makes me tick.
*  I feel like, you know, you get to know somebody just by talking about stuff rather than describing
*  yourself. You know? I do. I do. Yeah. But that's also again, I just need to figure out how to practice.
*  Well, I hope this has been part of that practice. And I, again, just want to say thank you. And
*  maybe sometime I'll see you down the line and we'll talk about Adam Sandler.
*  Thank you very, very much. And be well. Be well. Stretch your hips out.
*  All right. Take care. All right. Bye.
*  That was Anne Hathaway. Her new movie is The Idea of You and it's on Prime Video starting May 2nd.
*  Thanks so much for listening. If you want to hear another great conversation,
*  well, we've got one for you. Since this is the first week of our new show, we're launching with
*  two episodes. My co-host is Lulu Garcia Navarro and this week she's talking to Yair Lapid,
*  the opposition leader in Israel, about what's next for his country.
*  For those of us who are history buffs, we know that sometimes it takes only one really bad government
*  in order to, I don't want to say destroy, but weaken a country from within significantly.
