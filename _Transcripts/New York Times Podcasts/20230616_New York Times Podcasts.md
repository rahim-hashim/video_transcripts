# The Kids Take the Climate Change Fight to Court
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el3tqzxyOdc)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  As the movement to fight climate change gathers momentum, it has begun to make its way into
*  a new battleground, courts.
*  This week, a historic case has landed in a Montana courtroom where a group of young environmentalists
*  is suing the state.
*  Today, my colleague David Gellis explains why the case could be a turning point and
*  what a win in Montana would mean for the future of the climate fight.
*  It's Friday, June 16th.
*  David, welcome back to the show.
*  So there's a trial happening right now in Montana, and it's a landmark trial involving
*  climate change.
*  Why does this case matter?
*  It is a pretty remarkable moment.
*  I cover climate change, and I've written about international efforts to change policy across
*  the globe.
*  And a part of this is a really big move to get the courts involved.
*  People are suing states and federal governments and companies.
*  Most of those efforts have been proceeding slowly, but now this case in Montana has actually
*  gone to trial.
*  And it's the first time people have really had the chance to see if they can hold the
*  government accountable for climate change.
*  It's called Held v. Montana.
*  Okay, so tell me about this case, Held v. Montana.
*  Well, a few years ago, a group of 16 young people from the state of Montana sued the
*  state for its role in supporting the fossil fuel industry and contributing to climate
*  change.
*  And I've been talking to these kids and they tell a really vivid story about how the warming
*  planet is actually negatively impacting their lives.
*  And I spent some time walking in the woods outside Glacier National Park with one of
*  the plaintiffs who was 15 at the time the case was filed, but is now 18.
*  And his name is Lander Bussey.
*  Yeah, so some of my earliest memories, especially with my dad, are really, really early mornings
*  getting up at like the break of dawn to get out onto the prairie or some new river that
*  my dad and I were out to discover.
*  Lander and his brother grew up in the woods.
*  I remember the first time I ever caught a trout with my dad.
*  Being waist deep and chilling like 30 degree water.
*  Way bigger than the last one.
*  I remember shooting my first deer, going on hiking trips, my first solo fishing trip with
*  my friends.
*  Fishing and hunting and really having sort of this idyllic childhood in the mountains
*  of Montana.
*  We get over the hill and sure enough, there's this huge, huge male grizzly who just turns
*  his head around, stands up on his hindquarters, looks at us.
*  And I was scared senseless.
*  I'd never seen a bear in the wild by that point.
*  And my dad just told me to enjoy it.
*  As scared as I was, I couldn't help but feel how surreal what I was experiencing was and
*  how special it was.
*  Not many kids are ever going to get to see a grizzly bear, let alone in their wild native
*  habitat.
*  But they say that in recent years, it's become harder and harder to enjoy their own backyard.
*  We had an instance where it was a naturally caused wildfire that was pouring over one
*  of the hilltops and we could see this orange clouds projected up into the sky along with
*  these plumes of smoke.
*  A few years ago, wildfires came within sight of their home.
*  I've had instances in both middle school and in high school where we weren't allowed to
*  go outside at all during the day because of smoke conditions.
*  Wildfires are getting more intense.
*  Smoke days are forcing them indoors.
*  They say the hiking trails that they use have been washed away by torrential downpours with
*  more and more frequency as the weather gets more extreme.
*  High water levels in the spring are usually an indication of really heavy runoff off the
*  mountains, which really murks up the waters, makes trout's feeding patterns way more sporadic
*  and inaccessible, and often puts a dent in their populations as a result of that.
*  Along with that, and when I spoke to many of the plaintiffs, including Lander, they
*  say that the landscape that they've come to cherish is changing in front of their eyes.
*  And it's not just aesthetics here.
*  They talk about their health and the fact that their asthma is getting worse.
*  Some of them hunt and fish for food as part of their traditional cultures.
*  They say that's getting harder to do.
*  They say their properties being threatened by wildfires.
*  And in their contention, that's the direct result of climate change.
*  And they're asking their government to do something about it.
*  So their argument isn't just, I can't go outside and have a nice time enjoying nature.
*  They're actually saying, hey, this is messing up our lives, our health.
*  They're saying that it's actually changing fundamentally what it means to be a kid in
*  Montana.
*  So what's the actual legal argument here?
*  Because it's like, yeah, you know, it doesn't seem very fair, especially for kids who, of
*  course, aren't at all responsible for climate change.
*  But how do you actually assign legal blame to your state government?
*  Well, that was really the crux of the problem for these plaintiffs.
*  And plaintiffs in similar climate cases all around the world.
*  But it turns out there's one woman who's been working on that problem for a long time now.
*  Are we recording on our end?
*  We are.
*  We're good.
*  She's a nonprofit lawyer named Julia Olson.
*  Hi, Julia.
*  Hi.
*  And she's really the architect of Held v. Montana.
*  Tell me about Julia Olson.
*  Julia has been an environmental lawyer for a couple of decades now.
*  And when I spoke to her, she described a specific moment when her work on climate change really
*  came into focus for her.
*  It was the summer of 2006.
*  It was very hot.
*  And I was in Eugene, Oregon, where I live.
*  She happened to be pregnant and she went to the movies.
*  It's this old church that had been converted into a little theater and an Inconvenient Truth
*  was playing there.
*  An Inconvenient Truth.
*  That movie by former Vice President Al Gore.
*  And it changed her life.
*  We watched the film and I just saw play out in front of me all the destruction that was
*  already happening with climate change and really what was going to come next.
*  And I cried through the whole film practically.
*  After that, I gave birth to my second son and really started thinking about, okay, what
*  I'm doing right now is not making a dent in averting climate chaos.
*  And we need the law to do better.
*  And as lawyers, we have to do better to bring good cases before courts.
*  Julia realizes that she's not going to be able to have an impact on an issue like this
*  by pursuing piecemeal cases here and there as she had been doing.
*  Instead, she decides she is going to need a real overarching approach to take on what
*  she is now very clear is the defining issue of her lifetime as she believes.
*  What did she come up with?
*  Very soon after that, she learns about a legal theory.
*  The public trust doctrine.
*  The public trust doctrine.
*  The idea goes that the government, whether it's the federal government or the state government,
*  actually has a responsibility to take care of the natural resources, things like the
*  land, the environment, and ensure that those are protected for current and future generations.
*  And the language in constitutions is often quite broad.
*  The federal constitution guarantees the right to life, liberty, and property.
*  It guarantees equal protection under the law.
*  And Julia sees an opening to apply this new theory of how she can prosecute climate cases
*  with the U.S. Constitution and state constitutions as well.
*  But how is the government threatening those public natural resources?
*  How exactly is the government responsible for climate change and not, say, for example,
*  a fossil fuel company?
*  Well, it's not the government itself that's producing the fossil fuels.
*  But Julia argues that the government plays a huge and important role in all sorts of
*  other ways in supporting the industry overall.
*  They permit all of the fossil fuel production and transportation and combustion that is
*  happening.
*  The fossil fuel industry couldn't do what it does today without our governments.
*  It just wouldn't be possible.
*  So let's take fracking as an example.
*  It was the Department of Energy of the U.S. government that did the research and development
*  to develop that technology for the fossil fuel industry.
*  Billions and billions of dollars in subsidies go to make our fossil fuel energy system happen.
*  And we have evidence going back to the 1960s where the federal government knew that if
*  they continued to allow and promote the burning of fossil fuels, that it would cause catastrophic
*  climate change.
*  And she makes the argument that even with that knowledge, it has failed to change its
*  ways.
*  So her argument is that the government not only created an environment for fossil fuel
*  industries to thrive, they knew that doing so would contribute to climate change.
*  That's the case she's making.
*  But David, just to push back for a second, though, how fair is it to hold governments
*  accountable for this?
*  Like climate change is so complicated, right?
*  How do you zero in on the government in particular as being the cause of these effects when everything
*  they did is just basically capitalism in a way and making it possible for our economy
*  to function?
*  It's a question that's right at the heart of the cases she's bringing.
*  And I asked her this very question.
*  How do you make that leap from the government letting the world continue at pace without
*  completely blowing up the global economy to actually suggesting that they're doing something,
*  I don't know, nefarious or that is directly, to use your framing, in violation of the public
*  trust?
*  I mean, doesn't the public trust also ensure the ability to go make money and go to the
*  movies?
*  Yeah, David.
*  So I'll push back there a bit.
*  So our cases are about the public trust.
*  They're also about constitutional rights.
*  And she comes back to this issue that there are central rights that we have as citizens.
*  And those rights are threatened right now.
*  And when government takes actions that affirmatively threaten the lives of children, their homes,
*  their bodies, their personal security, and their rights of equal protection under the
*  law, then people can go to court and bring constitutional claims.
*  And so now it's time for the courts to get involved.
*  Okay, so she lands on this argument.
*  What does she do with it?
*  So in 2010, Julia founds an organization called Our Children's Trust, which is a nonprofit
*  firm that starts to bring constitutional climate cases on behalf of children.
*  And she really decides to focus on children because she says they don't have the ability
*  to vote, they don't have representation, and they are going to be the ones that experience
*  climate change most intensely in the generations ahead.
*  And pretty quickly, Our Children's Trust goes on and files cases in all 50 states and sues
*  the federal government as well.
*  How do they go?
*  Well, most of them don't get very far.
*  They face opposition in the courtroom.
*  Some of them are struck down.
*  And so it's not looking great for a little bit there.
*  But then they find a new approach, and it has everything to do with the state of Montana
*  specifically.
*  We'll be right back.
*  David, you just told us about the lawyer behind this lawsuit in Montana.
*  But what makes Montana the place where a case like this could go to trial?
*  Well the Montana State Constitution actually has very specific language in it that guarantees
*  residents the right to a clean and healthful environment and says it's the responsibility
*  of the government and citizens to protect that pristine natural environment for present
*  and future generations.
*  Okay, so this is not an implied right.
*  It's actually right there in black and white, like plainly in the text of the state constitution.
*  Yeah, Julia had been making a sort of broader argument about the public trust and the responsibility
*  of governments to take care of their people.
*  But in Montana, she didn't need to do all this work interpreting other vague language.
*  It was right there in the law.
*  And in fact, there are several other states that already have similar language in their
*  state constitutions.
*  Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Hawaii, New York added similar language to
*  its constitution last year.
*  And around the country, there are even other states that are trying to get similar language
*  added even today.
*  And for Julia and her team, this language was really the key to unlocking a strategy
*  that allowed them to get this case to trial.
*  So why did Montana have this in their state constitution?
*  Like how did that happen?
*  Well, here we need to rewind.
*  Back in the late 19th century, the mining industry became big business in Montana.
*  And it started exerting its influence not only over the state's economy, but over the
*  government as well.
*  One historian I talked to called Montana a corporate colony.
*  And when the Montana state constitution is actually first written, the language in it
*  is almost entirely deferential to mining interests and to energy interests.
*  I mean, corporate colony is a pretty strong phrase.
*  Yeah.
*  And then in the early 1970s, in the throes of that late 60s, early 70s environmental
*  movement, Montana citizens came to the state capital, well aware of the issues and determined
*  to write a new constitution to better serve the state for the 1970s and the years ahead.
*  The Americans actually hold a constitutional convention.
*  We are actually representatives of the people of the mining state of Montana.
*  So with that in mind, let's put ourselves to the task of creating the very best constitution
*  that we can get.
*  They decide to rewrite their constitution.
*  Is not Montana our home?
*  Is not the world our home?
*  Should we not have the right to protect our homes by appropriate legal proceedings against
*  those who would defile it?
*  And a big part of why they do that is to take back control of their state government from
*  what they see as the undue excessive influence of the mining community and the fossil fuel
*  industry.
*  So many shall be in favor of the motion to adjourn.
*  Signed aye.
*  Say aye.
*  Aye.
*  Opposed no.
*  It's so ordered.
*  And that's when they add this language.
*  So when this language was added, it was really before there was a widespread acceptance and
*  understanding of what was causing climate change.
*  The language was added to the Montana Constitution really in response to the mining industry
*  and how much pollution there was in the state because of it.
*  But the language was still pretty clear.
*  The government, it now said, had a responsibility to give its citizens a clean and helpful environment.
*  But over the last few decades, Montana's fossil fuel production has soared.
*  Montana is the nation's fifth largest producer of coal and the 12th largest producer of oil.
*  And the state's government has done a lot to support that development.
*  And what kinds of supports, David?
*  Like the kind that Julia was talking about?
*  Yeah.
*  Permits, subsidies.
*  The state's Republican government is currently very, very pro fossil fuels.
*  And in fact, they recently passed a law that bars the state's permitting board from considering
*  climate and emissions when deciding whether to allow a new project to get built.
*  Wow.
*  Like it can't even take climate change into account at all.
*  That just seems pretty crazy.
*  That's just the kind of thing that the plaintiffs and Julia say is the problem with the way
*  the state is operating right now.
*  Okay.
*  So I'm guessing that the state government in Montana does not love this lawsuit.
*  Not at all.
*  The state has responded incredibly strongly to this.
*  And since 2020, when this case was filed, and it was actually a Democrat who was governor,
*  the state has tried to fight it every step of the way.
*  And what's the state's argument?
*  Like what's its defense against Julia's case?
*  Well, we will see the defense play out at trial.
*  But what the state is contending is that even if fossil fuels are contributing to climate
*  change at large, it's almost impossible to say that the specific emissions caused by
*  fossil fuels in Montana are specifically responsible for the effects that they are seeing in that
*  state and thus specifically responsible for the damages that the children say that they
*  are incurring.
*  So this is interesting.
*  I mean, on the one hand, we know that without a doubt, anytime you burn fossil fuels, it
*  makes climate change worse.
*  But on the other hand, you can't pin climate change on one single factory or one single
*  mine or even one single state.
*  And this is one of the reasons why so many people are watching this case so closely.
*  You can't say that the emissions from one particular coal plant in Montana made a forest
*  fire in Glacier National Park that much worse.
*  On the other hand, we know that all of this is adding up and warming our planets right
*  now.
*  And critically, so far, the courts have not allowed that argument as a way to let the
*  state off the hook here.
*  We're also going to see at this trial the real introduction of what's known as attribution
*  science that is the growing body of scientific work that more compellingly and more specifically
*  than has been possible even as recently as a couple of years ago, make direct connections
*  and say that the fact that global temperatures have warmed roughly 1.2 degrees Celsius above
*  pre-industrial levels are in fact making fires more severe, are in fact making glaciers melt
*  more.
*  And we expect to see some of that attribution science on display in the courtroom this week.
*  So what exactly did Julia and the kids want to change?
*  Like if they win, what do they imagine will happen?
*  Well, they're not seeking money.
*  And that's important because a lot of people are contending that these kids who have decided
*  to be a part of this case are somehow like the puppets of environmental renegades.
*  And the kids will say, like, we're not asking for anything that's going to benefit us specifically.
*  Instead what they want is declaratory relief.
*  They just want the state to acknowledge that the burning of fossil fuels in the state and
*  the permitting and subsidizing of things like oil and coal and gas is making the climate
*  crisis worse.
*  More specifically, though, they are potentially going to seek changes in state law.
*  Remember the law I mentioned earlier about how the state can no longer consider climate
*  change when approving a major project?
*  That's the kind of thing that could potentially be repealed if the children and Julia win
*  here.
*  And from a purely symbolic standpoint, it would be one of the first times that a state
*  government is saying, yeah, we bear some responsibility here.
*  And that opens up a whole can of worms for what that means down the road, what it means
*  for other states and what kind of precedent it might set.
*  And because, you know, the judge surely knows it would open that big can of worms.
*  I wonder if it feels unlikely that Julia and these kids win.
*  Yeah, it would be unprecedented.
*  And it's something I asked Julia about.
*  Do you have concerns that what you're trying to bite off here is just too big for any one
*  court to chew on?
*  No, I don't have concerns.
*  I sit here as a woman.
*  And if courts hadn't been willing to take on that big question of whether someone like
*  me was entitled to the equal protection of the law, I mean, my life would have been completely
*  different growing up.
*  She placed this case in the context of other big social movements in our country's history,
*  things like women's rights and civil rights.
*  If courts hadn't been willing to reverse Plessy versus Ferguson and say that segregation
*  was unconstitutional, I wouldn't want to live in that kind of world.
*  Similarly, I don't think any of us wants to live in a world ravaged by climate change.
*  And no politician gets to decide if our kids get to grow up in a safe climate.
*  It's a matter of life and liberties.
*  And it's up to our courts to judge whether we hold those rights and if our government
*  is violating them.
*  One of the reasons this case is so interesting is that behind it is an absolute avalanche
*  of other cases that are making similar arguments in different ways and trying to hold not only
*  governments accountable, but specific companies as well.
*  And so this is not the last time we're going to be hearing about climate litigation.
*  These cases, after fits and starts and dismissals and appeals, finally made their way to trial.
*  David, I'm thinking kind of what would it mean if they make this big justice argument
*  in front of this judge in this state that wrote the idea of a right to a clean environment
*  into their constitution?
*  What will that mean for this broader effort of looking for a solution to climate change
*  through the courts?
*  Well, I think it would call into question the effectiveness of this language that we're
*  starting to see in more and more constitutions around the country.
*  And even more broadly than that, I think it would raise real questions about just how
*  effective the courts can really be as part of the overall solution set to addressing
*  the climate crisis right now.
*  That maybe courts aren't such a fruitful avenue for activists.
*  Yeah.
*  We talk a lot about precedent and how cases can set precedent.
*  And a defeat here would set a pretty troubling precedent for this legal strategy around the
*  world.
*  David, thank you.
*  Thanks so much for having me.
*  All this week, the judge in Montana has been hearing testimony from the young activists
*  as well as pediatricians and biologists.
*  Next week, the state is expected to mount its defense.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Thursday, the Supreme Court handed a victory to Native American tribes, upholding law aimed
*  at keeping Native American children with their tribes and traditions.
*  The case pitted a white couple from Texas against five tribes as they battled over the
*  adoption of a Native American child.
*  The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 gives preference to Native families.
*  The couple argued that the act discriminated against non-Native families because it hinged
*  on placement based on race.
*  But the court ruled seven to two in favor of the tribes, upholding the law that was
*  enacted to address the legacy of abuse of Native American children who were being separated
*  from their families and placed in non-Native homes.
*  A federal grand jury has indicted Jack Teixeira, the 21-year-old Massachusetts Air National
*  Guardsman who posted dozens of sensitive documents on social media on six counts of retaining
*  and transmitting classified national defense information.
*  The indictment paves the way for a trial stemming from one of the most damaging national security
*  leaks in recent history.
*  If convicted, he could face up to 60 years in prison.
