# Inside Russia’s Crackdown on Dissent: An Update
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vFJEqQ0W2A)
*  Hey, it's Sabrina.
*  This week, The Daily is revisiting some of our favorite episodes of the year and hearing
*  what's happened since they first ran.
*  Today, we revisit our conversation with Valerie Hopkins about one woman in Russia who spoke
*  out against the war in Ukraine.
*  It's Wednesday, December 27th.
*  Valerie, tell me about this reporting you've been doing about dissent in Russia.
*  Who are these Russians who are voicing their opposition to the war despite these really
*  dire repercussions?
*  You know, they're actually all really different people.
*  You might think there's like a profile, but there are sort of middle-aged guys in the
*  provinces, young, hip, highly educated college students.
*  There's a lot.
*  One of the cases that really stuck out to me was a teenager named Olesya Krivtsova.
*  She lives in a town outside of Arkhangelsk, very close to the Arctic Circle.
*  And for our first interview, actually, I connected over a call on the messaging app Telegram.
*  So Olesya is 19.
*  She's a student at University in Arkhangelsk studying advertising and public relations.
*  She's a vegan and a feminist.
*  She didn't really consider herself to be an activist.
*  But when the war in Ukraine started, like many young Russians, she talked to her family
*  and friends about it.
*  And most of them agreed with her that the war was wrong.
*  And last May, she actually decided to do something publicly for the first time.
*  May 9th, it's when Russia celebrates Victory Day, the end of World War II.
*  But this year, with a war going on in Ukraine, this year the holiday hit her differently.
*  It made her so angry that Russians are celebrating peace while bombing people in Ukraine.
*  So Olesya made some leaflets with her friends.
*  And the message was, World War II veterans also live in Ukraine and they are dying from
*  shelling now.
*  This war must end.
*  She actually goes around the city putting them up in different houses and residential
*  complexes.
*  And then they all went home.
*  But the next day, the authorities came to her apartment.
*  They'd seen the license plate of the car that she and her friend were using as they drove
*  around the city distributing these things.
*  Was it the police?
*  No, they were people from what's called the Center E, the Russian Center for Combating
*  Extremism.
*  What Olesya refers to as the political police.
*  And she said they forced her to apologize personally to the armed forces of Russia on
*  camera.
*  So because this was her first offense, something that's known as administrative in Russian,
*  she was fined, but it will stay on her record.
*  And basically that comes with a warning of if you do anything like this again, you will
*  have a criminal trial and the penalties are much higher and include prison time.
*  And so naturally, she limits herself to speaking out on Instagram occasionally and feels pretty
*  safe doing that because her account is private.
*  But as it turns out, even that was a step too far.
*  Fast forward a few months to December 26, she stayed up all night preparing for finals.
*  She finally goes to sleep around 7 a.m. and her mom leaves for work.
*  And all of a sudden she hears a voice in her apartment.
*  She thinks maybe it's her grandma checking on her.
*  But it's not.
*  It's actually the Russian authorities.
*  A swarm of men yelling at Alessia to get down on the floor.
*  And while she's face down, she looks up and sees a man holding a sledgehammer above her
*  head and she realized that they were just trying to intimidate her.
*  They take her down to the station eventually and that's when they tell her that...
*  She's being investigated not only for discrediting the Russian Armed Forces, but also for justifying terrorism.
*  Whoa, so what is that about?
*  There was actually a group of Alessia's classmates who had been paying very close attention to
*  what she was posting on Instagram and actually had reported her to the authorities for some
*  of her anti-war posts.
*  Basically a group of her friends had snitched on her.
*  Yep.
*  And you know, there was one post in particular that they brought to the attention of the
*  authorities.
*  It was after the Ukrainians bombed a bridge connecting Russia with Crimea.
*  And what she said was she understood why Ukrainians were rejoicing about it.
*  It's really this post that becomes the center of the allegations against Alessia.
*  And four of her classmates are the key witnesses in the prosecution's case against her in which
*  she faces a prison sentence of up to 10 years.
*  And there was this group chat in which some of the students were discussing whether or
*  not they would denounce Alessia.
*  And I actually saw some of the screenshots.
*  And one of the students at one point during this debate says, denunciation is the duty
*  of a patriot.
*  And I tried to call him.
*  And he answered the phone.
*  But as soon as I identified myself as a journalist, he hung up.
*  But then I went to Alessia's university.
*  I wanted to see what other students thought about this case.
*  So I went to the university with a photographer colleague and we split up.
*  And I started introducing myself to some students.
*  Most people just kept saying they had no idea what I was talking about.
*  That showed me the extent of the chilling effect that this had on the student body.
*  And then all of a sudden I got a message from my colleague who wrote to me that she saw
*  someone following us, probably from the FSB, the Russian Intelligence and Security Agency.
*  But someone following you?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, this happens when you travel in the Russian regions.
*  But it's always a bit nerve wracking because I really want to make sure that no one I talk
*  to gets harmed because they talk to me.
*  But eventually I was able to talk to the head of Alessia's department at the university.
*  He's 42 years old and he's in favor of the government and in favor of the war.
*  He actually wrote a negative character reference for the prosecution, even though Alessia said
*  she's never met him.
*  He said that he thought there should be limits to the kind of debate students could have.
*  And he also said that the informers, you know, the students that turned her in, he referred
*  to them as part of a healthy immune response.
*  He basically compared Alessia's public distaste for the war to a bacteria or an infection.
*  And he said these students were part of the organism of a healthy immune system of a society
*  that were actually, you know, making sure that the society didn't get more sick.
*  To prevent contagion.
*  Exactly.
*  He said the system worked exactly as it was supposed to.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Valery, where did Alessia's case stand when you interviewed her back in February?
*  When I first talked to her, she was under house arrest awaiting trial.
*  She had to wear an ankle bracelet that tracked her location and she wasn't allowed to use
*  any technology.
*  So she felt super alone.
*  Actually, her mom was kind of her only lifeline to the world.
*  And she said that in general, she was really scared and that every night before she would
*  go to bed, she and her mom would hug and say goodbye because they kind of never knew what
*  would happen the next day.
*  She had to go to court hearings every month and she knew that they could also just actually
*  put her in jail immediately.
*  And what are those court hearings like?
*  Well, a few days after I talked to her the first time, I actually traveled to our hangouts
*  to attend one of those hearings because I thought it would be probably my only chance
*  to really talk with Alessia in person and see her.
*  And we were waiting for the proceedings to start when something kind of unexpected happened.
*  A Russian TV crew approached me and started asking me repeatedly rapid fire.
*  What was I doing there?
*  Why was I interested in the case?
*  What do you think about the war in Ukraine?
*  Do you support Western weapons being used against Russian soldiers?
*  I don't actually think they were there to cover Alessia's trial because they didn't
*  ask her any questions when she spoke to the press ahead of the trial.
*  And they also left almost as soon as it started.
*  Oh, wow.
*  So it was kind of hard to tell what they were up to exactly, but the hearing itself was
*  relatively uneventful.
*  And in the end, the judge decided to leave Alessia under house arrest.
*  But then later that night, I realized why the television crew was interviewing me.
*  The exchange I had with the Russian TV reporters was part of a segment on the local news about
*  foreign interest in Alessia's case.
*  So you were on television?
*  Yes.
*  So at this point, your reporting on Alessia is really starting to come under the same
*  kind of scrutiny as the dissent itself.
*  So what's next for Alessia?
*  When does she go to trial?
*  Well, I stayed in touch quite frequently with her mom because Alessia is not allowed to
*  use technology.
*  And then all of a sudden, one day last month, her mother called to tell me that she had
*  some pretty major news.
*  Alessia had managed to escape Russia and made it to Vilnius, Lithuania.
*  Wow.
*  She was ecstatic.
*  And so when I was finally able to speak to Alessia directly a few days later from Lithuania,
*  she told me a little bit about what happened.
*  She said that there's this secret network of activists who help to spirit people out.
*  It's really underground.
*  She had to like completely disguise herself into a different person.
*  She was wearing a man's like big ugly coat.
*  She realized that nothing she could say would change anything.
*  And she decided to leave because she became desperate.
*  She also said that the real heroes are the people who stayed behind no matter the consequences.
*  So Alessia's story is the story of someone who resisted, but who ultimately fled, right?
*  But what about the people Alessia is calling the real heroes, the people who don't escape
*  and go to prison?
*  What about them?
*  The government has detained more than 20,000 Russians since the start of the war.
*  And I've reported on a few of those cases.
*  I remember one sentencing that I went to about a month ago that really stuck with me of a
*  man named Dima or Dmitry Ivanov.
*  He's also a student.
*  He's 23.
*  And his crime was actually reposting information from Western media about the killings in the
*  Ukrainian cities of Bucza and Mariupol.
*  It's customary in a Russian courtroom for the accused to say a final word, a statement
*  before the sentencing.
*  He said, we can't stop the war right now.
*  But that doesn't mean that we're powerless.
*  I want each of you to think about what they can do personally.
*  Russia will be free because we will make it that way.
*  And right after the speech, the judge delivered the sentence.
*  Eight and a half years in prison.
*  She asked him, do you understand the sentence?
*  He said he did.
*  And then the guards let him away.
*  So, Valerie, the Kremlin knows that that kind of thing is contagious.
*  Dima is essentially saying here, you don't need to go to jail, but you do need to act
*  and do something small.
*  Like the rector at Alize's University said, if it's left unchecked, it can spread.
*  Yeah, for the Kremlin and for Putin especially, you know, it's existential for them to maintain
*  the image that they do have broad support, that the war has broad support, and they are
*  doing more and more to try to force everyone to get in line or at least not do anything
*  that would pierce that image.
*  Valerie, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  After the break, Valerie shares an update on Alize.
*  In late November, Valerie checked back in with Alize.
*  Well, last time that I actually saw Alize's face, it was in February in a courtroom defending
*  herself against continued house arrest.
*  And now so many months later, the moment her face blinked onto the screen, it was amazing
*  to see the lightness that she now feels.
*  Catch me up on what your life is like now.
*  Now she's actually quite settled.
*  Not only is she studying at a university and speaking English quite well.
*  Now I live in Kirkenes.
*  She's moved to Kirkenes, Norway, which is just across from the Russian border.
*  I think it's something like 15 kilometers away.
*  She's also gotten a job.
*  I'm a journalist.
*  Writing about what's going on in Russia with a particular focus on political prisoners.
*  You get really upset.
*  Upset, upset, yes.
*  When I asked her how the experience changed her, she said.
*  I became an adult.
*  I made a lot of adult decisions.
*  I grew up, I became an adult, and I think she has shown incredible maturity in using
*  her freedom to report on people who were not as lucky as she was to be able to leave and
*  to try to keep the spotlight on them.
*  I often go to the border, go to the border and just walk near the border.
*  It's very strange for me, but very interesting.
*  You know, because usually I feel only hate, hate to Russia.
*  And I think she doesn't miss Russia as a place.
*  She doesn't miss her city, Arkhangelsk, but she does miss her family and her relatives.
*  Of course I miss.
*  I miss my mother, my sister, my family, my school maybe, and my time in Russia.
*  But not Russia like state.
*  But my mother came to Norway after eight days.
*  So I hope that everything will be okay.
*  It was so nice to see you and talk to you and I'm looking forward to meeting up soon.
*  And I hope that you have a great new year.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
*  Talk to you soon.
*  Stay in touch.
*  Bye.
*  Thank you.
*  Bye.
