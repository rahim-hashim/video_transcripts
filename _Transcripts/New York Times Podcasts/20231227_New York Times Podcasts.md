*  Hey, it's Sabrina.
*  This week the Daily is revisiting some of our favorite episodes of the year, and hearing
*  what's happened since they first ran.
*  Today, we revisit our conversation with Valerie Hopkins, about one woman in Russia, who
*  spoke out against the war in Ukraine.
*  It's Wednesday, December 27.
*  Valerie, tell me about this reporting you've been doing about dissent in Russia.
*  Who are these Russians who are voicing their opposition to the war, despite these really
*  dire repercussions?
*  You know, they're actually all really different people.
*  You might think there's like a profile, but there are sort of middle aged guys in the
*  provinces, young hip, highly educated college students.
*  There's a lot.
*  And one of the cases that really stuck out to me was a teenager named Alicia Kripsova.
*  She lives in a town outside of Archangel's, very close to the Arctic Circle.
*  And for our first interview, actually, I connected over a call on the messaging app Telegram.
*  Hi, my name is Kalecio.
*  So Alicia's 19, she's a student at University in Archangel's studying advertising in public
*  relations.
*  She's a vegan and a feminist.
*  She didn't really consider herself to be an activist.
*  But when the war in Ukraine started, like many young Russians, she talked to her family
*  and friends about it.
*  And last May, she actually decided to do something publicly for the first time.
*  May 9th, it's when Russia celebrates Victory Day, the end of World War II.
*  But this year, with a war going on in Ukraine, this year the holiday hit her differently.
*  It made her so angry that Russians are celebrating peace while bombing people in Ukraine.
*  So Alicia made some leaflets with her friends.
*  And the message was, World War II veterans also live in Ukraine.
*  And they are dying from shaling now.
*  This war must end.
*  She actually goes around the city putting them up in different houses and residential
*  complexes.
*  And then they all went home.
*  The next day, the authorities came to her apartment, the scene, the license plate of the car
*  that she and her friend were using as they drove around the city, distributing these
*  things.
*  Did the police know they were people from what's called the center, the Russian center for
*  combating extremism.
*  What Alicia refers to as the political police.
*  And she said they forced her to apologize personally to their armed forces of Russia on camera.
*  So because this was her first offense, something that's known as administrative in Russian,
*  she was fined.
*  But it will stay on her record.
*  And basically that comes with a warning of if you do anything like this again, you will
*  have a criminal trial and the penalties are much higher and include prison time.
*  So naturally she limits herself to speaking out on Instagram occasionally and feels pretty
*  safe doing that because her accounts private.
*  But as it turns out, even that was a step too far.
*  Fast forward a few months to December 26, she stayed up all night preparing for finals.
*  She finally goes to sleep around 70m and her mom leaves for work.
*  And all of a sudden she hears her voice in her apartment.
*  She thinks maybe it's her grandma checking on her.
*  But it's not.
*  It's actually the Russian authorities.
*  A swarm of men yelling at Alicia to get down on the floor.
*  And while she's face down, she looks up and sees a man holding a sledgehammer above her
*  head.
*  And she realized that they were just trying to intimidate her.
*  They take her down to the station eventually and that's when they tell her that she's
*  being investigated, not only for discrediting the Russian armed forces, but also for justifying
*  terrorism.
*  Whoa, so what is that about?
*  There was actually a group of Adesis classmates who had been paying a very close attention to
*  what she was posting on Instagram and actually had reported her to the authorities.
*  For some of her anti-war posts.
*  Basically a group of her friends had snitched on her.
*  Yep.
*  And there was one post in particular that they brought to the attention of the authorities.
*  It was after the Ukrainians bombed a bridge connecting Russia with Crimea.
*  And what she said was she understood why Ukrainians were rejoicing about it.
*  It's really this post that becomes the center of the allegations against Alessia.
*  And four of her classmates are the key witnesses in the prosecution's case against her in which
*  she faces a prison sentence of up to 10 years.
*  And there was this group chat in which some of the students were discussing whether or not
*  they would denounce Alessia.
*  And I actually saw some of the screenshots.
*  And one of the students at one point during this debate says denunciation is the duty of
*  a patriot.
*  Wow.
*  And I tried to call him.
*  Hello.
*  He answered the phone, but as soon as I identified myself as a journalist, he hung up.
*  And then I went to Alessia's university.
*  I wanted to see what other students thought about this case.
*  So I went to the university with a photographer colleague and we split up.
*  And I started introducing myself to some students.
*  Most people just kept saying they had no idea what I was talking about.
*  That showed me the extent of the chilling effect that this had on the student body.
*  And then Alessia got a message from my colleague who wrote to me that she saw someone following
*  us, probably from the FSB, the Russian Intelligence and Security Agency.
*  But someone following you?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, this happens when you travel in the Russian regions, but it's always a bit nerve-wracking
*  because I really want to make sure that no one I talk to gets harmed because they talk
*  to me.
*  But eventually I was able to talk to the head of Alessia's department at the university.
*  He's 42 years old and he's in favor of the government and in favor of the war.
*  He actually wrote a negative character reference for the prosecution, even though Alessia said
*  she's never met him.
*  He said that he thought there should be limits to the kind of debate students could have.
*  And he also said that the informers, you know, the students that turned her in.
*  He referred to them as part of a healthy immune response.
*  He basically compared Alessia's public distaste for the war to a bacteria or an infection.
*  And he said these students were part of the organism of a healthy immune system of a society
*  that were actually, you know, making sure that the society didn't get more sick to prevent
*  contagion.
*  Exactly.
*  He said the system worked exactly as it was supposed to.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Valerie, where did Alessia's case stand when you interviewed her back in February?
*  When I first talked to her, she wasn't her house arrest awaiting trial.
*  She had to wear an ankle bracelet that tracked her location and she wasn't allowed to use
*  any technology.
*  So she felt super alone.
*  Actually her mom was kind of her only lifeline to the world.
*  And she said that in general, she was really scared and that every night before she would
*  go to bed, she and her mom would hug and say goodbye because they kind of never knew
*  what would happen the next day.
*  She had to go to court hearings every month and she knew that they could also just actually
*  put her in jail immediately.
*  And what are those court hearings like?
*  Well, a few days after I talked to her the first time, I actually traveled to our
*  hungels to attend one of those hearings because I thought it would be probably my only
*  chance to really talk with Alessia in person and see her.
*  And we were waiting for the proceedings to start when something kind of unexpected happened.
*  A Russian TV crew approached me and started asking me repeatedly, rapid-fire, like, what
*  was I doing there?
*  Why was I interested in the case?
*  What do you think about the war in Ukraine?
*  Do you support Western weapons being used against Russian soldiers?
*  I don't actually think they were there to cover Alessia's trial because they didn't ask
*  her any questions when she spoke to the press ahead of the trial.
*  And they also left almost as soon as it started.
*  Oh, wow.
*  So it was kind of hard to tell what they were up to exactly, but the hearing itself was
*  relatively uneventful.
*  And in the end, the judge decided to leave Alessia under house arrest.
*  But then later that night, I realized why the television crew was interviewing me.
*  The exchange I had with the Russian TV reporters was part of a segment on the local news about
*  foreign interest in Alessia's case.
*  So you were on television?
*  Yes.
*  So at this point, you were reporting on Alessia, it's really starting to come under the
*  same kind of scrutiny as the dissent itself.
*  So what's next for Alessia?
*  When does she go to trial?
*  Well, I stayed in touch quite frequently with her mom because Alessia's not allowed
*  to use technology.
*  And then all of a sudden, one day last month, her mother called to tell me that she had
*  some pretty major news.
*  Alessia had managed to escape Russia and made it to Vilnius, Lysiwania.
*  She was ecstatic.
*  And so when I was finally able to speak to Alessia directly a few days later from Lysiwania,
*  she told me a little bit about what happened.
*  She said that there is the secret network of activists who helped to spirit people out.
*  It's really underground.
*  She had to completely disguise herself into a different person.
*  She was wearing a man's big ugly coat.
*  She realized that nothing she could say would change anything.
*  And she decided to leave because she became desperate.
*  But she also said that the real heroes are the people who stayed behind no matter the consequences.
*  So Alessia's story is the story of someone who resisted, but who ultimately fled.
*  But what about the people Alessia's calling the real heroes, the people who don't escape
*  and go to prison?
*  What about them?
*  The government has detained more than 20,000 Russians since the start of the war.
*  And I've reported on a few of those cases.
*  I remember one sentencing that I went to about a month ago that really stuck with me
*  of a man named Dima or Dimitri Ivanov.
*  He's also a student.
*  He's 23.
*  And his crime was actually reposting information from Western media about the killings in the
*  Ukrainian cities of Bucha and Mariupol.
*  It's customary in a Russian courtroom for the accused to say a final word, a statement,
*  you know, before the sentencing.
*  He said, we can't stop the war right now.
*  But that doesn't mean that we're powerless.
*  I want each of you to think about what they can do personally.
*  Russia will be free because we will make it that way.
*  And right after the speech, the judge delivered the sentence.
*  Eight and a half years in prison.
*  She asked him, do you understand the sentence?
*  He said he did.
*  And then the guards let him away.
*  So Valerie, the Kremlin knows that that kind of thing is contagious.
*  Dima is essentially saying here, you don't need to go to jail, but you do need to act.
*  Do something small like the director of the United States University said, if it's left
*  unchecked, it can spread.
*  Yeah, for the Kremlin and for Putin, especially, you know, it's existential for them to maintain
*  the image that they do have broad support, that the war has broad support.
*  And they are doing more and more to try to force everyone to get in line or at least
*  not do anything that would pierce that image.
*  Valerie, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  After the break, Valerie shares an update on Alessia.
*  And late November, Valerie checked back in with Alessia.
*  The last time that I actually saw Alessia's face, it was in February in a courtroom, defending
*  herself against continued health arrest.
*  And now so many months later, the moment her face blinked onto the screen, it was amazing
*  to see the lightness that she now feels.
*  Touch me up on what your life is like now.
*  Okay.
*  Now she's actually quite settled, not only is she studying at a university.
*  I think speaking English quite well.
*  Now I live in a Kirkeness.
*  She's moved to Kirkeness Norway, which is just across from the Russian border.
*  I think it's something like 15 kilometers away.
*  She's also got a job.
*  I'm Jordan Eastwall in Norwegian media.
*  Writing about what's going on in Russia with a particular focus on political prisoners.
*  And every day when I see new political cases, I worry about a striving.
*  You get really upset?
*  I'm upset, yes.
*  Well, my answer is how the experience changed her.
*  She said.
*  I became an adult.
*  I made a lot of adult decisions.
*  I grew up.
*  I became an adult.
*  And I think she had shown incredible maturity in using her freedom to report on people who
*  were not as lucky as she was to be able to leave and to try to keep the spotlight on them.
*  I often go to border, go to the border and just walk near the border.
*  It's very strange for me, but very interesting.
*  You know, because usually I feel only hate in Russia.
*  I think she doesn't miss Russia as a place.
*  She doesn't miss her city or her girls, but she does miss her family and her relatives.
*  Of course I miss.
*  I miss my mother.
*  She's still my family.
*  I miss my school maybe.
*  And my time in Russia, but not Russia like state.
*  But when my mother came in the way after eight days?
*  No.
*  Yes.
*  So I hope that you think you'll be okay.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  It was so nice to see you and talk to you and I'm looking forward to meeting up soon.
*  And I hope that you have a great new year.
*  Thank you very, very, very, very much for you too.
*  Thank you.
*  Talk to you soon.
*  Stay in touch.
