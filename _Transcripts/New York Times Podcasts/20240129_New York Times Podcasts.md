*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverny-C, and this is the Daily.
*  A decade ago, police departments across the country began requiring officers to wear body
*  cameras.
*  It was the single biggest change to come out of the police reform movement, a piece of
*  technology that promised accountability in policing.
*  Today, the Times Magazine and the news organization ProPublica investigate what happened
*  with that reform and why it has not lived up to its promise.
*  I spoke with ProPublica's Eric Ymanski.
*  It's Monday, January 29th.
*  So Eric, most of us have gotten pretty used to the idea that police officers wear body
*  cameras on the job.
*  It's part of the uniform at this point, essentially.
*  It was one of the big things to come out of the police reform movement over the last decade.
*  An activist had a lot of hope for these things.
*  You are an investigative reporter, and you have been looking into body cameras in the fate
*  of body cameras as a reform.
*  When did you start becoming curious about them?
*  As an early 2023, January, actually, there was a particularly horrific police killing
*  in Memphis.
*  It was a young man named Tyree Nichols.
*  Police had beaten him to death, and there was footage of it, and the footage came out,
*  and I was reading about it, and there was this one sentence in the story.
*  The sentence in the story said that the officers were beating him with their body-worn
*  cameras on, and they knew that their cameras were on.
*  It just stopped me.
*  I thought, how can it be that officers would beat somebody to death knowing it was being
*  recorded?
*  Right.
*  This camera was a device, supposedly, to stop misconduct, and here was this misconduct.
*  The camera was rolling, and no one seemed to really care.
*  Yeah, that was remarkable to me, and it was also a question of how was this big reform,
*  this huge, it was really the biggest changing in policing, I think it's fair to say, in
*  a generation.
*  How did it play out across the country?
*  Did the promise of transparency and accountability, was it really delivered?
*  Okay, so before we get to what happened without reform, remind us how body cameras first
*  came into use in the US.
*  How long have they been around?
*  So body cams first became popular about a decade ago in the United States, and it was
*  a very specific moment, and that was the police killing in Ferguson, Missouri of a teenager
*  named Michael Brown, that killing, there was no recording of it.
*  There was enormous disputes about what happened in the moments before he was shot, and the
*  killing set off the first nationwide Black Lives Matter protests.
*  You're going to want to share it, man.
*  And in response to that, my name is Leslie McSpend, the mother of Michael Brown.
*  Michael Brown's own mother called for police to be equipped with body-worn cameras.
*  On August 9th, there was no recording account of my son's last moments in life.
*  I still do not have closure.
*  Or the solid truth of what really happened that day.
*  Please let police want body cameras be a voice of truth and transparency in Missouri communities.
*  Thank you.
*  So then body-worn cameras began spreading incredibly quickly around the country.
*  The Justice Department announced 20 million in grants to get body cams on cops nationwide.
*  President Obama endorsed them and put federal money towards them.
*  Part of the reason this time will be different is because the President of the United States
*  is deeply invested in making sure that this time is taken.
*  And it was really an idea that appealed across the political aisle.
*  This is going to strengthen the people of South Carolina.
*  This is going to strengthen law enforcement.
*  Nikki Haley, then the governor of South Carolina, became the first governor in the country
*  to require officers to wear body-worn cameras.
*  And the notion behind all of this was that you would have footage that would do actually
*  a kind of a whole variety of things.
*  One is that there would be transparency so that community members could see for themselves
*  what officers were doing and were not doing.
*  Then you also have the accountability if officers were engaged in misconduct that they would
*  suffer some consequences for it.
*  And then the third thing was really the kind of great hope, which is that if officers knew
*  they were being recorded, they wouldn't engage in misconduct in the first place.
*  They wouldn't beat people or shoot people unnecessarily.
*  That was the hope behind all of it.
*  Right.
*  And as you said, despite all of this promise, there's this gathering evidence that cameras
*  are not actually delivering any real reform, even after they'd been adopted all over the
*  country as they had.
*  So Eric, where did you start to answer the question of what's going wrong here?
*  So I decided to look at New York City.
*  And there are a couple of reasons that I did that.
*  One, the NYPD is the world's largest police department.
*  And what the NYPD does other police departments around the country follow.
*  So that's incredibly important.
*  And then on top of that, there was this really interesting dynamic in New York, which is
*  that a federal judge actually ordered the NYPD to begin using cameras in response to problematic
*  policing.
*  And when did police in the city actually start wearing them?
*  Like when was the policy implemented and what happened when they did?
*  So in 2017, the then mayor de Blasio and the police chief gave a press conference in
*  which they said, this is the first day of the era of body-worn cameras.
*  And that means we are going on a pathway of transparency and accountability.
*  We are rebuilding trusts between the community and police.
*  And it is a new day for accountability and transparency.
*  Start my words, this is going to make us safer.
*  And so just a few months after the press conference and all those promises, the first killing
*  by police officers in New York City is captured on a body-worn camera.
*  And all those promises are put to the test.
*  So police got a call to check in on a young man named Miguel Richards, 31 years old Jamaican
*  college exchange student, lived in the Bronx and his landlord hadn't heard from him in
*  a while.
*  And so the police officers show up and after 15 minutes, they shot him to death.
*  God.
*  And a week later, police decide to disclose some of the footage.
*  And what is the footage they release show?
*  Officers walk into this apartment.
*  They find him in the far corner of his bedroom with dark sunglasses on, standing completely
*  rigid.
*  Do you see me?
*  Speak to me.
*  Are you seeing me right now?
*  I see you now.
*  Not moving at all.
*  And Ricardo, I see that knife in your hand.
*  He's holding a small knife next to his side.
*  It's not worth it.
*  Put the knife down and walk out here, which is really him.
*  And they tell him to drop the knife and he doesn't do so.
*  This is not going to end well for you if you'll put it down.
*  He doesn't respond at all.
*  He seems to be basically catatonic.
*  Put that knife down.
*  You hear me?
*  Put that knife on the floor.
*  Drop it.
*  And over the course of 15 minutes, the officers get increasingly concerned.
*  In part, they worried that he had a gun that they couldn't see his other hand.
*  You understand?
*  You were a second way to get shot if you don't tell us what's in your other hand.
*  We see where the hell the hand is.
*  And another officer comes with a taser.
*  I'll advise central to this time.
*  You know what the taser can work over here, please.
*  But before the officer with a taser can even use it, he's got a knife and a gun.
*  There's a gun there.
*  Drop it.
*  One of the other officers decides to fire his gun.
*  Yeah.
*  Just go.
*  Yeah, just go.
*  This is my never gun.
*  Just hit him.
*  They fire 16 times.
*  16 times.
*  Yeah, they fire at him 16 times.
*  You're back.
*  You're back.
*  You're back.
*  You're right.
*  And they kill him.
*  Wow.
*  And that's where the footage the police released ends.
*  And what did people think once that was made public, once the footage was made public?
*  So the police commissioner in a company internal message said sometimes the use of deadly force
*  is inevitable.
*  And that the officers did the right thing.
*  And as part of the message, he said, you know, it reflects that all officers show tremendous
*  restraint.
*  But some people noticed that police had not actually released the full footage.
*  What they had released was a compilation from a few videos.
*  And it wasn't the full recording of what happened.
*  And so a public interest lawyer soon after the shooting actually filed a public records request
*  for the full footage.
*  The police department rejected her request.
*  She kept pushing and went back and forth with the NYPD for well over a year.
*  And then a judge finally ordered the police department to hand over the full footage.
*  What did it show?
*  The full footage showed officers walking over his limp body.
*  One of them said he's still alive.
*  None of the officers who were initially there gave him any medical aid.
*  And Richard's lay bleeding on the ground for more than three minutes.
*  And one thing the video shows his officers looking for a gun.
*  But there was no real gun.
*  The officers later found a toy gun in his room.
*  And actually help had been seconds away.
*  Other specially trained officers were at the scene and were actually walking up the stairs
*  when the officers decided to shoot.
*  Where there was no urgency to do so.
*  So this new footage shows a much more complicated picture.
*  And one that calls into question, the behavior that the police commissioner previously said
*  was okay.
*  Yeah, the footage and the internal investigation together show a really different picture.
*  In fact, actually the NYPD's investigators concluded that Richard's had not been a danger
*  to anyone that he was quote unquote contained.
*  And the investigators had recommended punishing the officers for their conduct.
*  And then the police commissioner had decided to just simply ignore them.
*  So Eric, this seems to kind of fly in the face of what people working on police reform
*  had hoped, right?
*  That the footage from these cameras would be a clear window into what happened.
*  And in this shooting, the initial footage did not tell us the full story.
*  What do you make of this?
*  So I think fundamentally what this tells us is that having a little black box on officers
*  chest recording everything they do isn't enough.
*  Really you need to address a more fundamental issue of who controls the footage that's being
*  recorded on those cameras.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Eric, we just talked about the first killing caught on camera in New York City.
*  He told me that the footage the police released really didn't show the whole story.
*  And the real lesson from that is it's about who controls the footage.
*  So in the case of New York, who does actually control the footage?
*  I mean, it looks like it's a police, right?
*  Right, it's very much the police.
*  And the reason for that is not that somebody made a proactive choice to give the police control.
*  It's that really the police in New York have been left by and large to police themselves.
*  And so when body-worn cameras came along, it really just sort of as a default made sense
*  for the police to have the power to decide what is recorded, what is done with those recordings,
*  what is released and when.
*  And what's the argument for the police department having complete discretion over who sees the
*  footage?
*  How does the police department in New York talk about this?
*  How do they justify that?
*  So what the police department typically says is that there are privacy concerns.
*  And there are legitimate privacy concerns.
*  For example, if there's footage of somebody in their home and perhaps they're unclothed
*  or there's a minor there, they also typically cite there being an ongoing investigation.
*  And one of the issues is, well, that ongoing investigation can take well over a year.
*  On going investigation, another words, we really can't tell you anything because it might
*  actually affect the outcome of this legal process that we have underway.
*  Yeah, so I've spoken to a number of prosecutors and people in law enforcement about that specific
*  issue.
*  And there are legitimate reasons to hold off for some period of time, because of the logic,
*  if you have somebody who's involved in an incident, you perhaps don't want them seeing footage
*  so that they can figure out what you know.
*  But that's not a reason to withhold something for a year.
*  What people told me is that should be something that could be dealt with in a few days in
*  a small period of time and that particularly in something like police shootings, it has
*  to be balanced against the significant public interest in disclosure, in building trust
*  between police and the community.
*  Okay, so the police officers have to use these body cameras, but the police department
*  doesn't have to share what these cameras record.
*  Is there no check on the police department?
*  So there is a check, it's a civilian oversight board whose job it is to investigate allegations
*  of misconduct by the police.
*  The problem is that it is deeply powerless.
*  Just to take an example, it has no ability to access footage from body worn cameras themselves.
*  A former head of this oversight board described it to me as a mother mayi process.
*  They need to go to the NYPD and say, please, can we have this footage?
*  And you know, sometimes the NYPD gives it and sometimes they don't.
*  So this seems like a pretty big thing to leave out if you're trying to do a police reform.
*  It is.
*  And frankly, what I've found is that the NYPD has used that power to monkey wrench the process.
*  Just to give you a couple of examples of that, the NYPD would frequently tell the oversight
*  board that it didn't have footage of one incident or another only for the oversight board
*  to later discover that video existed.
*  And then the NYPD also would withhold footage of shootings and other serious incidents for
*  often well over a year.
*  And that didn't just sort of slow down the investigative process and actually cut it off
*  because in New York, there's a rule that discipline cases must happen within 18 months
*  of an incident.
*  And so when the NYPD withholds footage, it's not simply a transparency issue.
*  What it means is that this civilian oversight board effectively can't investigate and do
*  its job.
*  It has no ability to even recommend punishment against officers.
*  And what that means is that even though there are cameras, there can be no accountability,
*  which was the whole point of cameras to begin with.
*  Okay, so cameras were meant really as a defense against police misconduct.
*  But police in New York don't want that misconduct to have to be scrutinized or have one of
*  their own punished.
*  And because the police are the only ones with their hands on the button, so to speak,
*  it turns out to be kind of a useless tool, right?
*  These cameras, at least in New York.
*  When you were doing your reporting, did you find any place doing it differently?
*  Any place where actually was working?
*  So yeah, I spent some time looking for exactly that.
*  And I ended up in a place that I have to say surprised me.
*  And that's Chicago.
*  Really?
*  I mean, I don't generally think of Chicago as like a paragon of policing.
*  Chicago is certainly not a paragon of policing.
*  You're absolutely right about that.
*  It has a long and frankly brutal record of policing over many decades.
*  Chicago went through some enormous changes about actually a decade ago.
*  And that's after police shot and killed a 17 year old named Laquan Macdonald in 2014.
*  So at the time, there was a shooting every five days in Chicago of primarily black male
*  residents by police.
*  The shooting of Laquan Macdonald was initially treated as another one of those.
*  It's not a big story.
*  Then a whistleblower tipped off a local advocate and journalist
*  that there was dash cam footage of what happened.
*  And that what it showed was very different than the initial accounts.
*  The local advocate said that what it showed was that Laquan Macdonald had been shot 16 times.
*  It was essentially an execution.
*  The city had fought for nearly a year against that footage becoming public.
*  And when the footage came out as a result of a judge's order,
*  the consequences were cataclysmic.
*  The mayor of Chicago has fired the city's top cop.
*  The police chief was forced out.
*  His departure comes a week after one of his police officers was charged with the murder of a black teenager.
*  There was a federal investigation.
*  Accusations of a cover-up have followed the mayor since the video was released.
*  And the mayor at the time decided not to run again.
*  So the fallout, both from the killing but also from the cover-up, led to intense pressure,
*  on the city for major reform.
*  And as a result, ultimately, Chicago was forced to reimagine police oversight.
*  And what changes emerged after the scandal?
*  What happened? What did Chicago do?
*  So just to take some examples, they dissolved their ineffectual civilian oversight agency.
*  And they created a new one.
*  And as part of this process, remember, the footage had been so critical in Lequan McDonald's case.
*  And so they put disclosure of footage at the center of all of this.
*  The city committed to disclosing footage from shootings on a regular basis.
*  They said they would do so within two months of a shooting.
*  But just as critically, what they said was, it wouldn't be the police who is ultimately in control
*  of the footage and of what and when that is released.
*  What they did was the new civilian oversight agency had the ability to get footage itself.
*  It didn't have to send a very nice letter to the Chicago Police Department asking for footage.
*  It was not Mother May I of New York.
*  Right. They didn't have to do that. They literally have logins to the system so that they can pull
*  footage themselves. And then there's the second key component of it, which is that it's that agency
*  and not the police department that has the authority to disclose the footage publicly.
*  And that is what they have done.
*  Wow. So a very different scenario from New York.
*  And going back to the earlier part of our conversation, this would seem to be a real way to make
*  cameras the tool that activists imagine that they would be, right? By spreading around the
*  power to control the footage to other things like these civilian boards, taking them monopoly
*  away from the police department. So Eric, what is the effect of this reform on the numbers of police
*  shootings in the city? Has there been a change in the numbers since it was implemented?
*  So in Chicago, in the days since the Juan McDonald and all of these changes have been implemented.
*  And I should say that there were a enormous number of changes in Chicago. It wasn't simply cameras,
*  but there have been real significant measurable critical changes. So police shootings have dropped
*  by roughly half before I had said that there was one every five days last year. There were
*  22 and all of last year. Well, that's a big drop. Yeah, it's a significant drop. And it's not the only
*  drop. Use of force has also gone down by officers, by about a third. And so you see real significant
*  changes in Chicago. And you know, lots of folks I spoke with there emphasized things are not perfect
*  there. You still have officers frequently not turning their cameras on when they should. And you
*  still have the police department trying to create a narrative, for example, around shootings. But
*  it's much more difficult for them now that there's a third party that's releasing all the footage.
*  So Eric, we have two cities that look pretty different in terms of their approach to reform, right?
*  So across the United States, are there more New York's or more Chicago's? Which is typical?
*  So New York is typical. You know, we actually found that even in police shootings, the most extreme
*  use of force that police can engage in police are more often than not, not releasing footage.
*  So you really have lots of places looking like New York. You know, I've been reporting on this issue
*  for basically a year. And throughout it, I've been asking, can you tell me of an instance where
*  the police are not in charge of disclosing footage? And throughout it all, I could only find one.
*  And that's Chicago. So how applicable is Chicago to the rest of the country, Eric? I mean,
*  you said it's singular now, but could it be some sort of model in the future?
*  Yeah, so I think it could be. I mean, there's no natural law that says there must be
*  weak civilian oversight of policing in the United States.
*  What it requires, frankly, is political will on behalf of mayors and other local leaders
*  to say that this way isn't working and that there is actually another way to do things.
*  What happened in Chicago, you know, it took a horrific scandal to force change. But there's no
*  reason there has to be a horrific scandal in every city. I mean, it's we as taxpayers who are
*  paying for this technology and it can be useful. It can be put to good use and it can make a difference.
*  Eric, thank you. Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. On Sunday, three American soldiers were killed and 25 were
*  injured in a drone strike in Jordan. President Biden said in a statement that an Iran-backed
*  militia had carried out the strike, which took place on an army base near the Syrian border.
*  The deaths will put more pressure on Biden to respond more forcefully in the Middle East,
*  as the war in Gaza threatens to spread. And the United Nations highest court ruled that Israel
*  must take action to prevent acts of genocide by its forces in the Gaza Strip. However, the court
*  stopped short of calling on Jerusalem to stop its military campaign. The ruling, which was preliminary,
*  had elements that each side could embrace. The court ultimately allowed the genocide case to
*  proceed, which will likely keep Israel under international scrutiny for years to come.
*  Finally, former President Donald Trump was ordered by a Manhattan jury to pay $83 million to the
*  writer E. Jean Carroll for defaming her in 2019 after she accused him of a decades-old rape.
*  It was Trump's second trial in Carroll's case. She was awarded $5 million last spring. After a
*  jury found, Trump had sexually abused her in a burgdorf Goodman dressing room in the mid-1990s.
*  Carroll's lawyers had argued that a large award was necessary to stop Trump from continuing to attack her.
