# 1948
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKHcUZ1g844)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  As the Israeli-Palestinian conflict enters its darkest chapter in decades, both sides
*  are evoking the same foundational moment in their past, the events of 1948.
*  Today, I speak with David Schipler, the author of a book about the conflict, and a Jerusalem
*  bureau chief for the Times at a crucial moment in our understanding of 1948, about the meaning
*  and the reality of what happened that year.
*  It's Friday, November 3rd.
*  David.
*  Hi, Michael.
*  I really want to thank you for making time for us.
*  My pleasure.
*  So, David, in this war between Hamas and Israel, it's feeling extremely important to understand
*  the meaning of 1948, the year when Israel declared itself a nation, was attacked by
*  its Arab neighbors, and waged a war of independence that displaced Palestinians on a large scale.
*  Right now, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is describing this current war as
*  a second Israeli war of independence, a second 1948.
*  Palestinians in Gaza are invoking 1948 themselves to describe this current conflict because
*  of the potential for another massive dislocation from their homes.
*  But it feels like for any of these references, these claims and counterclaims, to really
*  make sense, we need to understand why Palestinians, why Israelis, are invoking this year and what
*  stories they tell themselves about what 1948 means.
*  And then, of course, we need to understand what actually happened that year.
*  And David, you arrived in Israel as the bureau chief there in the late 1970s.
*  And so I'm curious, when you took this job, what were the ways that both Israelis and
*  Palestinians talked about 1948?
*  Well, when I arrived, there were two clashing narratives, not overlapping at all.
*  When you go to the Middle East, you see immediately how people are imprisoned by history, especially
*  in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
*  And I kind of think of it as an arsenal of memory, that historical events that happen,
*  and we're in the middle of one right now, they get really chiseled in stone in terms
*  of the way people think about themselves and about their adversaries.
*  And the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is full of these markers of history.
*  1948 is one of the most important ones, what Israel calls its war of independence, and
*  what the Palestinians call Nakba, the catastrophe.
*  I mean, the thumbnail sketch of what happened is that in May of 1948, Israel declared itself
*  a sovereign state, and immediately was attacked by a crescent of five Arab countries, which
*  erupted into that war of independence, as Israel calls it.
*  And that war created the kinds of upheavals that wars do.
*  And every year, we can see the clash of historical narratives about this particular event vividly,
*  because Israel celebrates a double holiday, and Palestinians mark the event in a different way.
*  So Israel has first a day of remembrance or a memorial day, and it is a somber day.
*  A siren sounds, people pull over to the side of the road, people stop walking in the street,
*  and they stand for a minute or so in honor of the fallen soldiers and those who died
*  in terrorist attacks.
*  And then the next day is a day of celebration, the celebration of Israel's independence.
*  But on May 15th every year, the Palestinians do what Israelis do on their memorial day.
*  They stand in mourning, silently, to remember that event.
*  So that is the sort of graphic, dramatic illustration of how the two peoples remember that war of 1948.
*  We'll describe the two conflicting, contrasting narratives.
*  Well, the key of the Palestinian narrative is the idea that all of the Arabs who left
*  what is now Israel during the 1948 fighting were deliberately expelled by Israeli forces.
*  The numbers are roughly 700,000.
*  And they fled into neighboring countries.
*  The Israeli narrative for many years, and certainly at the time I arrived, was that
*  no Arabs were actually expelled by the Israeli forces.
*  They left of their own accord, either to flee fighting, as people do in wars, or because
*  Arab leaders advised them to leave pending an Arab victory after which they could return home.
*  So the Israeli narrative is one of moral purity because they were fighting for their existence
*  as an independent state against Arab armies.
*  And the Palestinian narrative was also one of moral purity in that they saw themselves
*  as purely victims being expelled deliberately by Israel from land they felt was rightfully theirs.
*  And this is no small dispute, the narrative conflict that you have just described.
*  No, it goes right into the present.
*  In fact, right now you see many Palestinians who have been urged by Israel to retreat south
*  from northern Gaza to southern Gaza, summoning up this idea of displacement and worrying
*  that they're not going to be allowed to come back.
*  It's a current issue.
*  And it translates into a yearning to return on the part of Palestinians.
*  Right, a sentiment that we have heard over and over in talking to Palestinians in Gaza
*  over the past few weeks.
*  Yes.
*  And I came across this years ago when I was in the Jabaliyah refugee camp in Gaza, a place
*  which is being pummeled now by Israeli bombing.
*  And I was sitting around with a few guys who were in their 20s and a kid came in.
*  He was a lanky boy of 12.
*  And somebody asked him where he was from.
*  Now he had been born in the Jabaliyah refugee camp, but he didn't say that he was from there.
*  He said, Barbarit.
*  Barbarit.
*  I said, I had never heard of Barbarit.
*  Well, a couple of these guys kind of smiled and explained that it had been an Arab village
*  up the coast that had been demolished really during the 48 war.
*  And his parents and grandparents, as it turned out, as we talked more, had left that village
*  more than 30 years before at that point.
*  And yet this kid said that that was where he was from.
*  That brought home to me how alive the yearning to return was and how Palestinian children
*  were being taught that they were from Arab towns that had been emptied or almost emptied.
*  Some had been destroyed.
*  Some had been converted into Jewish towns, places that now, given the circumstance, they
*  could not return because Israel would not let them.
*  And yet that was the dream to go back to those places someday and live there again, perhaps
*  in the beautiful way that their nostalgia and the family lore described, where the orchards
*  were more fruitful than probably in reality, where life was more peaceful than anything
*  they had experienced and more prosperous.
*  So that was the dream.
*  And it still is.
*  It still lives.
*  So what this boy's answer to your very simple question tells us is not just how ingrained
*  these narratives have become, but how they are passed down generation to generation.
*  Like you said, this boy was not born in that town in Israel.
*  He's probably never even been there.
*  But in his mind, that is the only conceivable answer to the question of what is home.
*  That's right.
*  That's an idea.
*  And the idea is alive and well and very motivating for many Palestinians.
*  When you arrive in Israel, are you finding comparable versions of an ingrained narrative
*  there around what 1948 and the birth of Israel looks like?
*  Absolutely.
*  The narrative of the 48 war was a very noble story from the Israeli standpoint.
*  Jews were refugees from pogroms and the Holocaust in Europe.
*  They had come to their biblical land where there had been a Jewish presence for thousands
*  of years.
*  And they had created a state.
*  And their victory was to be celebrated and to be kept in their history and their memory
*  as a time of great accomplishment with all the moral purity that you could imagine.
*  So there was no real questioning in most of the population about the virtue of the 1948
*  war.
*  And the details of it were all kind of good.
*  They treated the Arabs well.
*  They were nice to them.
*  They didn't force them out.
*  Some places they even urged them to stay.
*  In Haifa, there's a story about that.
*  That Arabs in Haifa were urged to stay, not to flee.
*  And all of that.
*  I mean, that's all part of the Israeli narrative.
*  I remember vividly a convention, a meeting that was in Jerusalem, the first gathering
*  of Holocaust survivors.
*  They've had more since.
*  And the theme was to pass the torch of memory to their children.
*  Many of the Holocaust survivors had not talked about their experiences.
*  The memories were too painful and too ugly to share with their children.
*  And so they came and their children came and they did talk with them.
*  And they wanted to talk about all their experiences with me too.
*  As I walked with a tape recorder through the convention hall, they would flock around me
*  and they would pull me aside.
*  And you know what the theme was that many of them wanted to strike in their accounts?
*  The theme was resistance.
*  We did not just go willingly like lambs to the slaughter.
*  We resisted.
*  And here's how we did it.
*  We carved out our zones of agency, so to speak.
*  And that conformed with the Israeli idea of 1948.
*  To create the state and to resist and to be strong.
*  Jews were no longer going to be massacred.
*  They were no longer going to be slaughtered.
*  They were no longer going to be gassed and imprisoned.
*  They were going to fight back.
*  They had the weapons.
*  They had the will.
*  They had the strength.
*  We are here.
*  This is where we will stay.
*  We are not going anywhere.
*  So this to me represents the core of the Israeli Jewish attachment to that history.
*  Okay, so these are the two very ingrained, seemingly immovable narratives that you're
*  absorbing in your time in Israel.
*  Yes, that's right.
*  And when I first got there in 1979, I came with a sensitivity to how people can manipulate
*  history.
*  I had been in Moscow for four years where I saw Soviet authorities do that, distort
*  history to suit their ideological preferences, their political ideas.
*  And I got really interested in that whole subject, how kids learned history in their
*  schools, how the media portrayed it.
*  So I was tuned in on that.
*  And soon after I arrived in Israel, I got a call from a guy who said he wanted to meet
*  me and talk to me about something.
*  I said, who is this?
*  He said, I can't say.
*  I said, what's it about?
*  He said, I can't say.
*  I said, I thought I'd left Moscow where this kind of thing happened all the time.
*  But I did meet with him.
*  His name was Peretzky Drone.
*  And he turned out to be the translator of Yitzhak Rabin's memoir, From Hebrew to English.
*  And the translator gave me the manuscript.
*  And he was very upset that the censorship committee, to which all former officials had
*  to submit manuscripts, had deleted several paragraphs, which completely changed the Israeli
*  narrative of the 48th war.
*  Huh.
*  Explain that and just put into context who Rabin is.
*  Well, Yitzhak Rabin had been prime minister.
*  But at the time, he was in the opposition.
*  He had a lot of time on his hands, I think.
*  And he wrote this memoir.
*  It was very detailed.
*  It was a good memoir.
*  And Rabin was commander of the Harel Brigade of the Haganah, that is the Jewish forces
*  in the 48th war.
*  And as commander of the Harel Brigade, in his description, he and Yigal Elon, who was
*  later to become foreign minister, wanted to know what they should do about the civilian
*  population in these two Arab towns near Tel Aviv, Lod and Ranleh.
*  They asked David Ben-Gurion, the first prime minister of Israel, what should they do?
*  And Ben-Gurion didn't answer, didn't answer.
*  And then he finally took them outside and made a gesture with his hand as if to say,
*  drive them out.
*  In other words, drive them out, expel them, kick them off the land.
*  That's right.
*  And here's what Rabin wrote.
*  Driving out is a term with a harsh ring.
*  Psychologically, this was one of the most difficult actions we undertook.
*  The population of Lod did not leave willingly.
*  There was no way of avoiding the use of force and warning shots in order to make the inhabitants
*  march the 10 to 15 miles to the point where they met up with the Legion, meaning the Arab
*  Legion.
*  And then he goes on and he says, the inhabitants of Ramleh watched and learned the lesson.
*  Their leaders agreed to be evacuated voluntarily on condition that the evacuation was carried
*  out by vehicles.
*  Buses took them to Latrum, and from there they were evacuated by the Legion.
*  And Rabin writes that some of the Israeli soldiers refused to do it and that psychological
*  counseling had to be done for the Israeli soldiers afterwards because it was such a
*  traumatic experience for them, not to mention for the Palestinians.
*  Now that was a complete reversal of the standard Israeli narrative, which was that at the time,
*  no Arabs were deliberately expelled by the Israelis.
*  Right. And this is a disruption of a very popular, widely held narrative, not just by
*  some random soldier, but by Yitzhak Rabin.
*  Yes, by Yitzhak Rabin.
*  But of course, from what you're saying, this translator tells you that that has been censored out.
*  He said it's been censored out.
*  He gave me the manuscript.
*  And of course, I didn't know the translator and how honest he was.
*  So I figured I needed to confirm this.
*  And so I called Rabin and I went to see him.
*  I'd never met him before.
*  This was the first time.
*  He'd been in Israel long.
*  And I put a tape recorder on his desk and he said, well, let's do this on background.
*  And I said, fine.
*  But I do have one on the record question I have to ask you.
*  And I told him about this account that I'd seen in the manuscript.
*  And he said, oh, I can't talk about it.
*  And I said, well, why do you think they cut it out?
*  He said, I don't know.
*  I was surprised.
*  Bingo.
*  I had my confirmation.
*  And then he went on to say, with a little sardonic grin, I gave the censors things
*  to do.
*  I wrote about Israel's nuclear weapons, for example.
*  And I knew they'd cut that out.
*  But I was surprised they cut this out.
*  So in a somewhat roundabout way, Rabin confirms to you that he did write this account of expelling
*  Palestinians in the 1948 war, that it was true, but that the Israeli government censored
*  it out, which makes sense given what you just said about how powerful these narratives
*  are.
*  So what did you do with this information?
*  Well, I wrote a story for the Times and included in it the entire section of the manuscript
*  that had been deleted by the censor.
*  And I thought, well, this is going to make a big splash in Israel.
*  There's going to be a lot of comment on this.
*  Israelis are very introspective.
*  And they'll look at this and say to themselves, wow, this is quite something.
*  I didn't know this.
*  But instead, what happened was it was a kind of muffled response.
*  It was an effort to minimize the possibility that this really happened or to diminish its
*  significance in terms of scope.
*  That is, well, a couple of towns.
*  What you're saying is narratives don't easily crumble.
*  Narratives are very, very firmly embedded in people's need to believe things.
*  But what happened a couple of years later was that the Foreign Ministry declassified
*  documents from the 1948 war.
*  And an Israeli journalist turned historian, Betty Morris, mined those declassified documents
*  in a thorough way and wrote a very significant book detailing the towns and villages from
*  which Arabs were expelled, those from which people just fled of their own accord, perhaps,
*  or to get out of the way of the fighting, all of that.
*  So he managed to take the Israeli narrative and inject it with all of the complications
*  and nuances that every war contains.
*  But even though the fact that there were expulsions has been now documented, that doesn't mean
*  that the clash of historical narratives has been resolved.
*  Not at all.
*  Not at all.
*  And so I became very interested in exploring what actually happened during that war.
*  We'll be right back.
*  David, once the door opens to a reinterpretation of the narratives around 1948 and we get all
*  this reporting and declassification of documents and a kind of truer version of events emerges,
*  what do you actually understand to have been the accurate story of 1948?
*  Well, to go back a little bit before 1948 to set the stage, it's important to understand,
*  as Israelis will point out, that there was basically an unbroken Jewish presence in the
*  Holy Land from biblical times.
*  There were very intense religious communities in Jerusalem, in Hebron, now in the West Bank,
*  in Safed, in the Galilee.
*  And in the 19th century, late 19th century, more Jews began to come from both Arab countries
*  and from Europe and also in accordance with a movement, a cause, an idea called Zionism,
*  which was developed as the notion that there should be a Jewish state, independent, strong
*  on that ancient land.
*  And at that time, that area of Palestine from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean, which
*  is the land in dispute, was ruled by the British under a mandate that had been decided on by
*  the League of Nations in the wake of World War I when the Ottoman Empire was defeated.
*  The predecessor to the United Nations.
*  That's right.
*  The precursor to the United Nations, the League of Nations.
*  So the British ruled Palestine under that mandate.
*  The Jews who came to live in that area in those years before World War II even, encountered
*  a mixture of reception by Arabs who had lived on that land for generations.
*  They were not newcomers.
*  And they were a mixed group, so to speak.
*  There were Muslims, there were Christians, there were Druze, a religion that keeps its
*  tenets secret.
*  There were Bedouins who are semi-nomadic.
*  So it was a mixture of Arabs of different affinities and different family lines, and
*  not necessarily identifying themselves with the word Palestinian.
*  That identity, that label, developed later.
*  But nevertheless, they were attached to their land.
*  I mean, their birthplaces, their families' birthplaces.
*  And when Jews came in from Europe, many of the Arabs saw them as interlopers, aliens,
*  colonialists as they had seen the British.
*  Even though for Israeli Jews, the notion that they're colonialists, or were at the time,
*  is very odd and foreign.
*  Because it wasn't that there were French who were in Algeria who could just go home, or
*  Brits in India who could just go home.
*  That was their home.
*  That was their new home.
*  And they, you know, some of the Jews who were mostly farmers at that point, I mean, they
*  were forming kibbutzim, you know, were trying to find places on what they considered to
*  be empty land.
*  But in some cases, the land was grazing land.
*  It might not have been cultivated, but it was used for grazing for goats and so forth.
*  So the very presence was considered somewhat aggravating to some of the local Arabs.
*  And that was not a welcome development from the point of view of many of the Arabs.
*  So there was a Zionist movement, a push for a Jewish state long before World War II and
*  the Holocaust.
*  Yes, that's right.
*  You know, World War II ended in 1945.
*  Six million Jews had been slaughtered by the Nazis.
*  Many, many others had feared for their lives and become refugees.
*  Internationally, there was a great sympathy for the Jews and for the idea that they ought
*  to have a refuge, a homeland, a natural homeland, according to the Zionists, was in the biblical
*  lands.
*  So in 1947, the United Nations passed a partition plan, dividing that land between the Mediterranean
*  and the Jordan River into two states, an Arab state and a Jewish state.
*  Take this British controlled land and basically give some to these Jews who were there and
*  some to the Arab population that was there.
*  That's right.
*  Exactly.
*  And if you look at the boundaries of that partition plan in 1947, it looks like a gerrymandered
*  congressional district.
*  But they basically followed the lines of the Jewish population in the area.
*  They left out of the Jewish state areas that were mostly Arab.
*  But there was there was mixture on both sides.
*  I mean, there were certainly Arabs in the parts that were designated as a Jewish state.
*  What happened then was that the Jewish forces accepted the partition plan and the Arabs
*  did not.
*  The Arabs within the area rejected it and Arab countries rejected it.
*  The Jews accepted this partition from what I've read in history because they felt fairly
*  weak militarily and figured this was as good as they could get and they were going to get
*  a state.
*  And I think there was a sense that the Arab countries thought that they were superior
*  militarily and could easily defeat this ragtag army that was getting its weapons from Czechoslovakia
*  mostly.
*  They did not get any weapons from the United States, by the way, at that time.
*  The U.S. was trying to stay out of it.
*  You know, it had a little kind of skeleton of an air force, but, you know, it wasn't going to be much of a
*  foe, you know, a real opponent.
*  I mean, they could get rolled over.
*  And I think that was probably the assumption at the time.
*  And also, there was just from inside to the local Arabs didn't want this Jewish state either because they
*  were interlopers.
*  They were Europeans coming in, foreigners, not indigenous to the land and therefore had no real right there.
*  They were not accepting of that.
*  And in May of 1948, the time at which the mandate by the British was to end, the British withdrew and
*  Israel declared its independence and then was attacked instantly.
*  Yes, that's correct.
*  Arab armies from Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, too, which sent a unit under Egyptian
*  control, attacked and the 1948 war began.
*  And what happens once the Arab neighbors of this new nation of Israel attack?
*  There was a lot of fighting and, you know, the fight went on from May of 1948 until early in 1949.
*  And the Israelis turned out to be stronger than the Arabs thought they would be.
*  And they were effective enough to defeat the Arab armies and roll them back and actually expand the
*  boundaries of what became Israel beyond what the partition plan had provided.
*  Now, what they didn't get at that time was the Gaza Strip, which was in the hands of Egypt.
*  That remained in Egyptian hands.
*  And they didn't get the West Bank of the Jordan River, which was in the hands of Jordan and
*  remained so until the 1967 war.
*  And they also didn't get all of Jerusalem.
*  And David, now that we're not just speaking about narratives, but about established historical
*  facts, what happens to the Arabs on the lands that are in question during this period when
*  Israel is achieving these victories against these Arab countries?
*  So it's true that an estimated 700,000 Arabs left what is now Israel, and they did so for a
*  variety of reasons.
*  Some fled the way people do in war, which was just to avoid the fighting.
*  And some fled because Arab leaders told them to get out pending a victory by the Arab forces,
*  after which they could come back.
*  Some were expelled deliberately, as we now know, by Israeli forces.
*  Some fled because they were afraid that they would be massacred.
*  And there were massacres of civilians by Israeli forces.
*  The most infamous was Deir Yassin, a village right on the outskirts of Jerusalem.
*  And that was known before the declassification of Israeli documents.
*  But once those documents became available, Benny Morris found about two dozen places where
*  civilians were massacred.
*  And that scared a lot of other Arabs who heard about them.
*  And even where there was no violence or demands that they leave, people fled because they were
*  afraid that the Israeli forces coming in would massacre them.
*  Right.
*  So those are the reasons, the basic reasons.
*  And what the Palestinian narrative has done is to put all of the departures in the category of
*  deliberate expulsions.
*  And that is an exaggeration.
*  But all the other reasons that people left don't really lessen the pain that has been passed down
*  generation to generation by the Palestinians, which still animates their cause and fuels
*  their desire to return.
*  So not only did Israelis expel Palestinians, despite the narrative that they didn't, some
*  Israelis participated in the killing of Arab civilians during this conflict.
*  Yes.
*  And when all this information is disclosed from these declassified documents in the archives,
*  it reveals that the Israeli myth is just that.
*  It's a myth.
*  It's very sanitized.
*  By the way, the Palestinian myth is also a myth.
*  So you have this clash of narratives, which you could also call a clash of myths.
*  Right.
*  So to that point, when we think about that Palestinian narrative, that claim inherited
*  through many generations that the 700,000 Palestinians who left Israel were expelled
*  from their homes during the creation of Israel, the story you're saying is more nuanced.
*  It's more complicated than that in part because Israel was attacked and attacked back.
*  And there's an open war.
*  Like you said, some Palestinians are leaving for fear of that war.
*  Some are leaving because they are being expelled.
*  Some are leaving because they fear that they could be expelled or worse massacred.
*  And there's no doubt that all forms of that kind of dislocation have to be wrenchingly painful.
*  But in a conflict where the details matter and are constantly being litigated, the historical
*  record from what you're saying makes clear that not all 700,000 Palestinians were expelled
*  forcibly by Israel as a matter of policy.
*  It might be more accurate to say that many of these Palestinians had to leave their homes
*  as a result of a war.
*  I think that puts it very well.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, there are lots of reasons that people left the war at the core of it, of course.
*  And it's pretty ugly.
*  War is, you know, terrible things happen.
*  And they did in 1948.
*  Now, in some places, they were allowed to come back.
*  But most of the Arabs who left or were driven out during the 48 War were never allowed to return
*  to their homes inside what is now Israel.
*  It's probably worth noting also that many Arabs did not leave and stayed in Israel.
*  And now they and their descendants make up about 20% of Israel's population.
*  So David, at the end of the 1948 War, when Israel emerges victorious, what does the world
*  look like for both of these peoples?
*  Is Raleigh's as well as Palestinians who have, through a combination of expulsions and flight,
*  are not on their lands?
*  Well, at that point, they were trying to build up their resilience and build up their economy
*  and fulfill their dream of building a Jewish state.
*  And it wasn't just Palestinians who were displaced.
*  Many Jews living in Arab countries were expelled by those countries and fled
*  of their own accord sometimes.
*  Most ended up in Israel.
*  And the results of that population shift are seen in Israel today, where
*  at least half of the population are now descended from Jews who lived in Arab countries.
*  And the Palestinians?
*  Well, the Palestinians were scattered into a diaspora in many countries around the world.
*  But the bulk of them, at least at first, ended up in refugee camps in Lebanon, Syria,
*  Jordan, which controlled the West Bank at the time, and in the Gaza Strip,
*  which was under Egyptian control.
*  So that diaspora, so to speak, which ended up in the refugee camps, is still conscious of its
*  origins and has passed down through the generations the story of displacement.
*  David, why wasn't there a creation of a Palestinian state after Israel's victory?
*  Because there are still these people who had been promised through the partition
*  a country, just as the people of Israel have been promised a country.
*  Why didn't a Palestinian state emerge in the aftermath of this war?
*  Remember that this was a war not between the Palestinians and the Israelis.
*  This was a war between Arab countries and the new state of Israel.
*  So at the end of the War of 48, armistice agreements were signed
*  that established the borders of Israel.
*  And what wasn't Israel was Arab states.
*  So there was no talk that I'm aware of, of creating a so-called Palestinian state.
*  I don't know that the concept was in the conversation at that point.
*  Through the years, despite lip service given to the Palestinian cause by Arab leaders,
*  their interest in supporting that cause has been, aside from being rhetorical,
*  has really been wanting.
*  The Palestinians were not accepted as citizens, by and large, in the Arab countries where they
*  fled.
*  Palestinians have been victims of the Arab world as well as of the Israelis.
*  And what is life like for these Palestinians as refugees in the period after the war?
*  The population was very impoverished.
*  The refugee camps began as camps.
*  They're still called camps, although that's a misnomer.
*  They've become established slums.
*  The poverty rate is still fairly high.
*  It's very difficult for Palestinians to have a comfortable and prosperous life
*  when they're confined to the camps.
*  And lots of Palestinians have left the camps and they've been able to
*  emigrate to various countries in Europe, the United States.
*  And so those folks are doing better.
*  But it's not so easy to get the visas.
*  It's not so easy to accumulate the money to make that change.
*  And there's an ideological resistance to doing it too.
*  I remember at one point when I was there, Israel wanted to build housing outside refugee
*  camps in Gaza.
*  And the local Palestinians rejected the idea vehemently because they thought it was an
*  effort to undermine their status as refugees, to basically do what's now called normalize
*  the occupation.
*  So there's a whole history of attempting to keep alive the idea of displacement.
*  The refugee status and the yearning to return.
*  And from the Israeli point of view, the idea of return for these Palestinians represents
*  what?
*  A threat to the existence of the Jewish state for two reasons.
*  One, the Jews would be outnumbered by the Arabs in the voting rolls.
*  Right now, if you take the West Bank and Gaza and Israel proper all together in East Jerusalem,
*  the population division is about even maybe even slightly tipped toward the Arab side.
*  So in an open pluralistic, fair, free democracy, Arabs would outvote Jews.
*  So that's one issue.
*  The other is the security concerns.
*  I mean, we've just seen it in the Hamas attacks where Israeli Jews were attacked in their
*  homes in their kibbutzim.
*  And the notion that, you know, lots of Palestinians would be allowed to come in and live inside
*  Israel terrifies Israelis.
*  David, we've spent a lot of time here trying to understand narratives and reality.
*  But the more time you spend understanding 1948 and the context surrounding it, it seems
*  the thing that becomes very clear is that Palestinians and Israelis emerged from it
*  with a strong claim to being victims.
*  Israelis are victims of Arab countries seeking Israel's destruction at the moment of its
*  birth.
*  And the forces of anti-Semitism that led to the Holocaust and in the minds of so many
*  Israelis necessitated Israel in the first place.
*  Palestinians are victims of the war that results from Israel's creation, including Israeli
*  tactics that forced many of them from their homes and later by the rejection that Palestinians
*  faced from their Arab neighbors.
*  And the fact that Israel won the war and Palestinians and their allies lost doesn't really
*  change their view of themselves as victims.
*  Exactly right, Michael.
*  Exactly right.
*  They are both victims.
*  I remember an Israeli telling me once when you put two victims together, it's like mixing
*  fire and kerosene.
*  Neither side recognizes the other's victimhood.
*  Although you have to say that there are some Israelis who do see the Palestinians as victims,
*  even of the 48 war, after the declassification of documents showing that there were expulsions
*  of Arabs.
*  That fact worked its way into some Israeli textbooks at the university level and then
*  also at the secondary school level to an extent.
*  I think Israelis have come to see that there were such expulsions and there were injustices,
*  but that has not overcome the sense of great pride and accomplishment in creating the state
*  through that war of independence.
*  And there are some Palestinians who see Jewish victimhood, but when they speak publicly
*  about it, they get themselves into trouble.
*  There was a professor at Al-Quds University in Jerusalem who used to teach a course on
*  the Holocaust to Palestinian college students, and he actually took them to visit Auschwitz.
*  And he got them to see Jews as victims and understand the historical roots of their
*  arrival in this place, this holy land.
*  And what happened to him?
*  He was threatened and ultimately he was fired.
*  So the obstacles to seeing the other and recognizing what the other has gone through
*  are immense.
*  They're immense.
*  So we have here a conflict between two peoples who are victims of each other, but not only
*  of each other, also of the larger world.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  And in this case, how you understand the conflict and how you understand the whole question
*  of victimhood depends very much on where you start the clock, where you think the story
*  begins.
*  Exactly right.
*  David, thank you very much.
*  We really appreciate it.
*  Thanks for listening.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to another day.
*  Sam Bankman Fried, the founder of the doomed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was convicted
*  on all charges of fraud and conspiracy on Thursday after a month long trial that exposed
*  the hubris and risk taking across the crypto industry.
*  The conviction puts Bankman Fried in league with the biggest financial fraudsters in history.
*  Overall, his victims lost nearly $10 billion in funds and he now faces a sentence of up to 110
*  years in prison.
*  And on Thursday, the Israeli military said it had encircled Gaza City and was waging
*  close quarters combat with Hamas as they push forward with what Israeli officials have predicted
*  will be a long and bloody ground invasion.
*  Meanwhile, good morning from Rafa.
*  I just arrived to the crossing.
*  They're going to start calling people.
*  I know my name is on the list, but I don't know when I will enter.
*  The evacuation of foreign nationals and wounded Palestinians from Gaza into Egypt entered its
*  second day on Thursday.
*  Among those leaving was Wafa El-Sakha, the subject of a daily episode on October 16th.
*  When the war broke out, El-Sakha, an American citizen who had grown up in Gaza, became trapped
*  in Gaza where she was visiting family.
*  I'm glad that I'm going to go and meet with my grandson and my husband and my boys and their wives.
*  At 1.30 p.m. local time on Thursday, she crossed into Egypt, then boarded a minivan with other
*  Americans bound for Cairo.
*  I don't know how I feel.
*  I left my whole family behind.
*  Needed my help, but I couldn't help them.
*  But I need to go to my other family too.
*  I don't know why we have to choose.
