# The Sunday Read: ‘Sure, It Won an Oscar. But Is It Criterion?’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP5EIJsuYj8)
*  My name is Joshua Hunt and I'm a contributor to the New York Times magazine.
*  This week's Sunday Read is my story for the magazine about the history and enduring cultural
*  influence of the Criterion Collection, a home video company that's been around for 40 years.
*  It started out selling laser discs in the early 1980s.
*  These days, its mission, to highlight what it calls important classic and contemporary
*  films from around the world, is mostly carried out through sales of DVD and Blu-ray discs.
*  Criterion not only survived all these technological shifts in the business of how movies get made
*  and distributed, but it's prospered.
*  Five years ago, it launched a streaming service of its own.
*  But in an age when our tastes are so algorithmically determined, the Criterion Channel stands
*  out for its reliance on human curation.
*  Every film is handpicked.
*  Nothing gets recommended based on what others are watching or what you've watched before.
*  I first came across Criterion in the late 90s when I became obsessed with its DVD release
*  of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai.
*  Eventually, I bought every Kurosawa film Criterion released on DVD.
*  And, over time, I developed this trust in the Criterion brand, where I would occasionally
*  buy movies that I knew nothing about.
*  I think it's how a lot of people's relationship with Criterion goes.
*  It starts with movies they know, but eventually they're taking a leap of faith based on the
*  brand and not the filmmaker.
*  Criterion is who they trust to tell them what is good cinema.
*  So here's my article.
*  Sure, it won an Oscar, but is it Criterion?
*  Read by Sean Taylor Corbett.
*  This week's audio was produced by Jack DiSidoro.
*  The music you'll hear was written and performed by Aaron Esposito.
*  In October 2022, amid a flurry of media appearances promoting their film Tar, the director Todd
*  Field and the star Cate Blanchett made time to visit a cramped closet in Manhattan.
*  This closet, which has become a sacred space for movie buffs, was once a disused bathroom
*  at the headquarters of the Criterion collection.
*  A 40-year-old company dedicated to gathering the greatest films from around the world and
*  making high quality additions available to the public on DVD and Blu-ray and, more recently,
*  through its streaming service, the Criterion Channel.
*  Today Criterion uses the closet as its stockroom, housing films by some 600 directors from more
*  than 50 countries.
*  A catalog so synonymous with cinematic achievement that it has come to function as a kind of
*  film hall of fame.
*  Over four decades, through a combination of luck, obsession and good taste, this 55-person
*  company has become the arbiter of what makes a great movie, more so than any Hollywood
*  studio or awards ceremony.
*  For more than a decade, the Criterion closet has also served as the backdrop for a popular
*  online video series in which actors and filmmakers, Nathan Lane, Aubrey Plaza and Ethan Hawke
*  among them, pick out their favorite Criterion titles to take home.
*  Like other celebrity guests in the Closet Picks series, Field and Blanchett plucked
*  their selections from the neatly ordered shelves and used them as conduits for spontaneous
*  bursts of evangelism.
*  Field praised Raymond Bernard's Wooden Crosses as one of the greatest war movies ever made.
*  While Blanchett singled out Larissa Shepitko's The Ascent as something that has to be owned
*  by every single human in the world.
*  Neither bothered to mention Tar, the film they were otherwise working so hard to promote.
*  Inside the Closet, even the biggest stars are reduced to a state of childlike fandom.
*  There's no cynicism in the Closet, Field told me.
*  It's all love.
*  It's all about why people do what they do and how powerful movies are for us.
*  Each year, Criterion selects 50 or 60 new entrants to add to its catalog, which now
*  includes 1,650 films.
*  Some Hollywood directors campaign relentlessly for their films or their favorite films from
*  the past to make the list.
*  For lesions of film fans, Criterion is akin to the Louvre, but with an aura of hip, the
*  writer and director Josh Safdie told me in an email.
*  When Safdie's film, Uncut Gems, which he directed with his brother, Benny, entered the Criterion
*  collection with the spine number 1101, he said they couldn't help feeling as if they
*  had snuck into the museum that they had admired for so long.
*  Being a part of the collection is something that we're both incredibly proud of, Safdie
*  told me.
*  It may sound corny, but it was more meaningful than awards.
*  Criterion's commitment to film and filmmakers has helped the company, which began in the
*  1980s by releasing films on VHS and Laserdisc, a precursor to DVDs, with a comparatively
*  enormous diameter of 12 inches, to stay relevant and profitable through a series of tech revolutions
*  that have upended the industry.
*  While studios and streaming services chase audiences by producing endless sequels and
*  spin-offs, trying to wring fresh content from old ideas, Criterion has built a brand that
*  audiences trust to lead them, even to the most obscure corners of the film universe.
*  Criterion's success in marketing beautiful, strange, complex movies is the road not taken
*  by most of Hollywood.
*  A steadfast belief in the value of human creativity and curation over the output of any algorithm.
*  One day in the spring of 1992, a year after taking over as director of Criterion, Michael
*  Nash was sitting in his beachfront office in Santa Monica when he got an unexpected
*  phone call.
*  Like many people who work for years in Hollywood, Nash has a tendency to describe events as
*  if he were reading lines from a screenplay.
*  You're sitting in the office, and on the desk there's the old-style intercom, he told me.
*  The operator takes an incoming call, and then it's like, Michael Nash, David Bowie on line
*  four.
*  Bowie was calling about Nicholas Rogue's 1976 film, The Man Who Fell to Earth, in which
*  alien visitor who masquerades as human and succumbs to the human condition.
*  Nash remembered seeing the movie years earlier and finding it amazing but difficult to understand.
*  I was totally confused, he said.
*  The reason audiences couldn't make sense of it, Bowie explained, was that the theatrical
*  release for The Man Who Fell to Earth was missing 18 minutes of film that was cut by
*  the distributor.
*  It got butchered, Nash told me.
*  Years later, its star was hoping that Criterion might consider releasing Rogue's original
*  cut of the film on Laserdisc.
*  Criterion was founded nearly a decade earlier by the CD-ROM pioneer Bob Stein, along with
*  his wife, Aline Stein, and a former Warner Brothers executive named Roger Smith, to explore
*  the technological possibilities of the Laserdisc.
*  Then a novel format that could accommodate multiple audio tracks and allowed viewers
*  frame of a film with no image distortion.
*  Criterion would track down the original negative or best surviving preprint version, then hire
*  technicians to scan the film, remove blemishes when possible, and correct colors that may
*  have faded or turned pink over time.
*  The vision, says Rebecca Odick, who worked as head of design at Criterion from 1991 to
*  1994, was getting people access to all these great films.
*  Before the emergence of the home video market in the late 1970s, Hollywood studios had little
*  use for films whose theatrical runs had concluded.
*  They ceased to be commodities and were often destroyed or transferred to public archives
*  where they remained vulnerable to fire, deterioration, and discoloration.
*  Nonprofits led the nascent movement to preserve and restore motion pictures until Criterion
*  helped create a market for them.
*  The company's first release was a Laserdisc edition of Citizen Kane that included supplementary
*  materials like a video essay and extensive liner notes on the provenance of the negative
*  from which the restoration was made.
*  Next came King Kong, which featured the first ever audio commentary track, inspired as an
*  afterthought by the stories that the film scholar Ronald Haver told while supervising
*  the tedious process of transferring the film from celluloid.
*  The novelty of the Laserdisc meant licensing fees cost virtually nothing compared with
*  the dominant VHS tape format.
*  Acquiring the rights to Citizen Kane and King Kong from RKO Pictures cost Criterion around
*  $10,000.
*  Securing the best surviving print of a film often required assiduous detective work.
*  The original negative for Dr. Strangelove was lost, says Morgan Holly, who served as
*  an in-house producer for the Criterion Laserdisc of Stanley Kubrick's 1964 Cold War satire.
*  There was one print that was struck from the original negative that was somewhere in the
*  world.
*  One of Criterion's editors, Maria Palazzola, tracked it down only to learn that on its
*  journey to the United States, it took a detour through Japan where strict anti-pornography
*  laws prompted customs officials to order a test screening that would almost certainly
*  have degraded or destroyed Kubrick's sole personal print of the film.
*  It was this battle, Holly told me, but in the end, they persuaded the Japanese authorities
*  to send the print on its way unscreened and unscathed.
*  Criterion sought to restore films not only to pristine condition, but also with the intent
*  of the filmmaker in mind.
*  The company popularized the practice of letterboxing, or presenting a film in its original aspect
*  ratio by adding black bars at the top and bottom of the screen rather than cropping
*  the image to fit a standard television display.
*  Director's commentary tracks were another Criterion innovation.
*  Some of the earliest were recorded by Martin Scorsese for the Taxi Driver and Raging Bull
*  Laserdiscs, which helped cement his influence on an entire generation of young directors.
*  I knew from Scorsese, from those commentaries sometimes, how they were accomplishing those
*  shots.
*  The filmmaker Wes Anderson told me.
*  And I think I got a sense of his approach with actors of trying to get a sort of documentary
*  feeling to certain aspects of those movies.
*  Criterion's respect for creators was what caught Bowie's attention.
*  On the phone with Nash, he offered to record an audio commentary for the Criterion edition
*  of The Man Who Fell to Earth, which was released on Laserdisc in March 1993 and quickly became
*  a cult classic.
*  The thing about The Man Who Fell to Earth and so many of the other projects is you've
*  got films whose greatness was squelched somewhat by the process of taking them to market, where
*  the people who had the projects didn't understand them and would recut them for commercial release,
*  Nash told me.
*  His priority was to help make Criterion an enterprise that would restore the director's
*  vision and get the film right for posterity.
*  When Terry Gilliam's dystopian classic Brazil entered the collection as a special edition
*  box set in 1996, the director told me that he seized the opportunity to invite viewers
*  to take sides on his well-publicized feud with the head of Universal Pictures, Sidney
*  Sheinberg.
*  They had cut almost all the fantasy sequences out, Gilliam said.
*  They were making a different film.
*  They were making Sid's film, which was ultimately missing 20 minutes of footage.
*  Gilliam told me he insisted that Criterion include both his own cut and Sheinberg's version
*  in its release, so people could decide for themselves.
*  Was I the idiot or was the studio?
*  Always in awe of auteurs but never in their thrall, Criterion producers have never been
*  afraid to look beyond the biggest and most marketable names.
*  When Criterion released Peeping Tom, a 60s psychosexual thriller by the English director
*  Michael Powell, the company chose not to ask Sorcesi to record the audio commentary, though
*  he would have been the obvious candidate, having done them for other Criterion editions
*  of Powell films.
*  The job instead went to a feminist scholar, Laura Mulvey, the author of the influential
*  essay Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema, which brought forward the concept of the male
*  gaze.
*  Over the years, such decisions added up to an editorial voice that became influential,
*  even authoritative, transforming a mere distributor of films into a creator of film culture.
*  As time passed and its catalogue grew, so too did a sense among Criterion leaders that
*  the collection could become more than a mere archive, that it should have something to
*  say about contemporary cinema too.
*  During his brief stint at the helm of the company, Nash focused on acquiring newer movies
*  that he found both commercially interesting and culturally important, like Shortcuts by
*  Robert Altman and Katsuhiro Otomo's dystopian anime masterpiece Akira.
*  He also made Criterion an early proponent of the new wave of African-American cinema
*  by releasing laserdisc editions of films by young directors like John Singleton, Boys
*  in the Hood, and the Hughes Brothers, Menace to Society.
*  The year after Nash left the company, it released a laserdisc for Do the Right Thing, the first
*  of three Spike Lee films to join the collection.
*  Criterion staff was fewer than 50 employees, each with different interests and tastes,
*  and they were soon forced to confront a question that film buffs argue about to this day.
*  What makes a film worthy of inclusion in the Criterion collection?
*  In 1989, the company's most controversial choice was Ghostbusters, a comedy starring
*  Bill Murray that grossed more than $200 million at the box office.
*  It was important, but in a different way than the other films in the collection were.
*  You know, the Bergman films and the Kurosawa films, Holly told me.
*  It was an important film because a lot of people watched it.
*  Some of Holly's colleagues nevertheless disagreed vehemently with the decision.
*  There was one producer, I won't name his name, but he wrote this 10 page internal memo about
*  why we should not do Ghostbusters, he told me.
*  That was one of many attempts Criterion made to curb its stuffy image, among them The Rock
*  and Armageddon by Michael Bay.
*  Those are frequently cited as outliers in the collection, a former Criterion producer,
*  Issa Club told me.
*  And yet, he said, they serve as examples of what was once a very important genre of Hollywood
*  blockbusters built around big budgets and big movie stars, which has been supplanted
*  by franchise properties.
*  A shift Bay played a prominent role in as the director of the first five films in the
*  Transformers franchise.
*  In September, when I called Michael Bay at his home in Miami, he seemed blissfully unaware
*  that many cinephiles don't think his films belong in the collection.
*  He was also unaware of Criterion's continued existence, but told me quite earnestly how
*  cool it was that they were still around.
*  His enthusiasm for its laserdiscs was palpable, as he described washing cars for the cash
*  to buy them, just as he did to afford the best stereo equipment.
*  I just remember it being the pinnacle, Bay said of the brand.
*  Bay also gamely entertained my questions about the most infamous feature of Criterion's commentary
*  track for Armageddon, in which the movie's star, Ben Affleck, mentions an on-set spat
*  with Bay over the plot.
*  Why, Affleck wondered, would it be easier to prepare oil rig workers for outer space
*  travel than to train NASA astronauts how to drill into and then destroy an asteroid on
*  a collision course with Earth?
*  I told him to shut the **** up, Bay said.
*  Ben has a wry personality, so you just have to come back at him with that same type of
*  personality.
*  In the late 90s, as Criterion shifted to DVD, the company had a tried and true template,
*  but also a desire to keep growing.
*  They started to push the boundaries, Peter Becker, Criterion's president, told me.
*  They released films like a collection of music videos by the Beastie Boys and experimental
*  films of Stan Brakhage.
*  The brand's cultural cachet had grown to such an extent that being selected for inclusion
*  in the collection could boost a young filmmaker's sales as well as reputation.
*  Kelly Reichardt, whose films Certain Women and Old Joy did not enter the collection until
*  much later, explained that, at the time, the Criterion and premature meant getting the
*  equivalent of dedicated shelf space in video stores alongside big-name male directors.
*  Back in the video store days, it was really hard to get a shelf if you were a woman, Reichardt
*  told me.
*  They have all the dudes stocked by director with their entire catalog in one place, and
*  my stuff would be all spread throughout the store.
*  Over time, Becker told me, there was a creeping awareness that, little by little, somewhat
*  accidentally, we had supported and propped up a canon that was largely white and male.
*  In August 2020, after the New York Times published the article, How the Criterion Collection
*  Crops Out African American Directors, Becker took responsibility for what he called his
*  blind spots.
*  Subsequently, and in response to the murder of George Floyd, he said, the company set
*  out to correct course.
*  Since then, it has released additional films by Steve McQueen and Ousmane Sombin and added,
*  among others, Marlon Riggs and Cheryl Dunye, whose 1996 romantic comedy The Watermelon
*  It's a film that is so genuine and connects with audiences so beautifully, Becker told
*  me.
*  Adding it to the collection was a no-brainer once the rights became available.
*  Dunye told me that she was proud of its inclusion and happy to have made something that enriches
*  the global storytelling that Criterion represents.
*  Securing the rights to films remains a defining factor in determining what ends up in the
*  Licensing often starts with a wish list submitted to various Hollywood studios.
*  What goes on that list is often a result of conversations and meetings among technical
*  staff, producers and editors, and, of course, Becker and the chief executive of Criterion,
*  Jonathan Terrell.
*  I've seen more movies than a lot of my friends, Becker said.
*  I certainly haven't seen more movies than all of my colleagues put together.
*  Occasionally, high-powered interlopers have their say by lobbying Becker.
*  For a few years, I kept asking him about this film by Dino Ricci, Il Sorpasso, says Jim
*  Jarmusch, director of Down by Law, Ghost Dog and other Criterion titles.
*  And he says, damn it, Jim, it's you and Marty Scorsese.
*  You guys are calling me every month or so about this damn film.
*  Becker didn't remember those calls.
*  He said Antonio Monda, an Italian writer and filmmaker, was its major champion.
*  But one way or another, Il Sorpasso entered the collection in 2014.
*  Criterion has shaped generations of filmmakers who grew up under its influence.
*  Josh Safdie told me that he watched countless Criterion releases in high school, starting
*  with Kurosawa's Seven Samurai and Fritz Lang's M.
*  He got his first glimpse of the directing process from a behind-the-scenes documentary
*  included with a Criterion DVD for Wes Anderson's film Rushmore.
*  Among the supplementary features for the Criterion DVD of Francois Truffaut's The 400 Blows,
*  he recalled seeing his first glimpse of an actor's audition tape.
*  Back then, you were lucky to get a theatrical trailer as an extra on a DVD, he said.
*  Getting a look into Truffaut's process was really special, which in turn made the disc
*  a really special object.
*  The extra touches that made them special objects also meant they were more expensive than standard
*  DVD releases.
*  So Safdie and his brother Benny would make illicit copies of the Criterion discs they
*  rented by mail through Netflix.
*  Benny would make his own Criterion DVD inserts, Safdie said.
*  He would do this by mimicking the unifying aesthetic features of each Criterion DVD,
*  a catalog number on the spine designating its place in the collection and drawn across
*  the top of its cover, a thin line, above which distinctive text with extra-wide kerning spelled
*  out the Criterion collection.
*  Criterion's distinctive visual language began to emerge in the early 90s when Otick, the
*  former head of design, started building up its art staff with an aim to really show the
*  power of these films through the cover designs, she told me.
*  To do that, it was sometimes necessary to go through every frame of film in search of
*  the perfect image.
*  Other times, images alone were not enough.
*  For the cover of Robocop, we had an actual aluminum cast letterpress plate made and then
*  photographed the plate with a 4x5 camera, Otick says.
*  It took days, she told me, but using a physical piece of metal gave it a feeling of aesthetic
*  truth.
*  When Wes Anderson started working with Criterion on DVD releases of his films, the cover designers
*  incorporated illustrations that his brother Eric Chase Anderson had made as part of the
*  pre-production process.
*  Anderson, who asked that verbal tics like uh and um not be excised from his quotes,
*  told me that he had always admired how Criterion covers tended to be, more adventurous than
*  uh what a movie studio would be inclined to go with.
*  The work being done by its art department, he said, was on par creatively with the famously
*  impressionistic movie poster designers of Soviet-era Poland.
*  They invent their own uh their own posters, he said, their own imagery to go with the
*  movie.
*  Anderson was equally eager to work with specialists like the mastering supervisor Lee Klein, who
*  inherited from his mentor, Maria Palazzola, a rigorous approach to editing that begins
*  with preserving the intent of the filmmaker rather than the results they achieved.
*  If some technical limitation had made the film look a certain way, Klein might try,
*  within reason, to help them get closer to their vision than they had the first time
*  around.
*  Across three decades at the company, Klein told me, his actual duties on any given project
*  have varied wildly depending on the filmmaker and the source material.
*  Michael Mann, for example, wants the digital copies of his films to be faithful to the
*  35 millimeter print.
*  John Waters makes the most of Klein's ability to improve the look of films that were originally
*  shot for very little money.
*  He's a guy who wants to make the movies look as good as they can, and everyone always thinks
*  he would probably want to make them look as bad as they can, Klein said of the Pink Flamingos
*  director.
*  It's just the opposite.
*  He wants them to look like Bergman films.
*  Klein sometimes works for years on a restoration project, as in the case of Satyajit Ray's
*  Pothar Panchali, Aporazhito and Opur Shancher, three films from the second half of the 1950s
*  that are collectively known as the Apu Trilogy.
*  The late Indian filmmaker was beloved by other great masters of cinema.
*  Scorsese saw Pothar Panchali as a young boy, and Kurosawa once compared never seeing a
*  Ray film to never having seen the sun or the moon.
*  But he was not very well known even among cinephiles.
*  Changing that through the release of a criterion box set required the restoration of sections
*  of the films from the trilogy that had been badly damaged in a fire by the time Klein
*  started working on them.
*  Klein repaired what he could, found other sources to replace what he couldn't, and digitally
*  married them in such a way that they matched.
*  The undertaking was a source of great pressure, he told me.
*  You feel the cinematic weight of the world on your shoulders when you're dealing with
*  those classics, he said.
*  One wrong move and the print might be damaged irreparably, another great film lost to history.
*  In 2019, after the sudden demise of its popular streaming partnership with TCM, called Filmstruck,
*  A tremendous opportunity, I think, from an aesthetic standpoint, a content standpoint,
*  for Criterion to have our own space and our own place in this kind of new streaming world,
*  Altman said.
*  Criterion made a conscious decision, Becker told me, to use the architecture of streaming
*  technology differently from the way others have.
*  Instead of an algorithm, viewers are guided to what they might want to watch through careful
*  human curation.
*  Go essays, interviews with filmmakers, and programming blocks resembling those once common
*  at independent movie theaters throughout America.
*  Some as straightforward as retrospectives celebrating specific filmmakers, others as
*  niche as collections dedicated to obscure genres like Gaslight Noir and Gothic Noir,
*  between which, Becker assures me, there is a difference.
*  They're not algorithmic by nature, Becker said of the major streaming services.
*  They're algorithmic by intention.
*  The workload associated with keeping the service going, however, can be immense.
*  The strain was particularly acute after Criterion laid off 20% of its staff near the end of
*  2022.
*  A reorganization, as Becker called it, from which many staff members have since been brought
*  back to the company as its financial situation improved.
*  Altman, who was among those temporarily laid off and brought back on a freelance basis,
*  nevertheless felt that doing things the hard way was still the correct path forward for
*  the Criterion channel, just as it had been for the brand's laserdiscs and DVDs.
*  You know all those streaming channels.
*  It's all the content war, right?
*  Altman said.
*  I mean, it's like, who has the most content?
*  It's not necessarily the best content.
*  That's the challenge for Criterion.
*  The benefit of this curation, Kelly Reichart told me, was that you don't feel like you've
*  entered a mall and you're going to exhaust yourself.
*  With some other streaming services, she told me, she often gives up before settling on
*  anything to watch.
*  When we spoke, she was preparing for a talk she was invited to give in Tokyo on what would
*  have been the director, Yoshujirō Ozu's 120th birthday, by watching as many of the 40 or
*  so films of his that are available on the Criterion channel.
*  I did the same, often stopping between daylong Ozu matinees to reflect on what Todd Field
*  had called the messiness of our own narrative, which is to say the process by which friends,
*  lovers and strangers guide us toward movies that end up changing our lives.
*  Field told me a story about waiting tables at a Manhattan restaurant in 1984 and being
*  shoved across the street to see a film festival at Lincoln Center.
*  He saw films by Victor Núñez, Jim Jarmusch, the Coen brothers and Vim Venders, he said.
*  But that's just because somebody pushed me across the street.
*  For Field, that's what Criterion represents.
*  Not an algorithm saying this will turn you on, but the gift of being shoved toward great cinema.
