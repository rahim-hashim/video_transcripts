# Was the 401(k) a Mistake?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV9cUhQQ6ek)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Over the past few weeks, the U.S. stock market has been on a tear, soaring to record levels
*  and delivering a shot in the arm to retirement accounts.
*  The trouble is, millions of Americans don't have such accounts, and even if they do, have
*  little or no money inside of them.
*  My colleague Michael Steinberger has been trying to figure out why Americans are retiring
*  so poorly, and traces much of it back to our growing reliance on the 401k.
*  It's Monday, May 20th.
*  Michael, we are going to talk to you today about what doesn't look on paper like the
*  world's sexiest subject, but I think actually is a very sexy subject, which is retirement
*  in the United States.
*  And you began your journalistic inquiry into the subject of retirement in America with
*  a very provocative question.
*  You asked, was the 401k a mistake?
*  Has this vast system of personal retirement plans that we now all rely on, pretty much,
*  has it failed us?
*  And I wonder why exactly you decided to ask that provocative question right now.
*  I ask that question right now because we are having an unprecedented number of Americans
*  reaching retirement age.
*  This year alone, it's estimated that 4.1 million Americans will turn 65.
*  It's a record number, what the AARP calls the silver tsunami.
*  And this is the first cohort of Americans, the first generation of Americans who entered
*  the workforce 40 years ago when 401ks became sort of the dominant vehicle for establishing
*  a retirement nest egg.
*  401ks, just for the sake of clarity, our employer provided retirement savings plans.
*  Basically, you set aside a certain portion of your paycheck to an investment account
*  of your choosing.
*  And the hope is that those contributions, with the help of the financial markets, will
*  grow substantially over time.
*  And so this generation of American workers that's now entering retirement age are the
*  products of a 40-year experiment with self-directed retirement financing.
*  And now we get to see whether it worked.
*  And we know it worked well for a lot of people.
*  The concern is that it didn't work as well for many others and that a lot of Americans
*  are now reaching retirement age without having adequate money put aside for their retirements.
*  Just how inadequate is that retirement picture?
*  One estimate is that 49% of people in the 55 to 65 age bracket have nothing put aside
*  for retirement.
*  The numbers are quite stark.
*  Half of the population of those at or near retirement have nothing put away.
*  That's what the numbers indicate.
*  And depending on the estimate, we're looking at maybe 10 to 20% of all seniors already
*  are living in poverty.
*  And so for many, retirement is an unobtainable aspiration.
*  And there's a strong case to be made that 401ks are largely responsible for the fact
*  that so many Americans don't have adequate savings.
*  Well, this feels like the moment in a daily episode where I think we have to roll back
*  the tape a bit and have you explain how this 40-year-old 401k experiment ever began.
*  So let's start with the story of how we have come to rely so much on the 401k in the first
*  place.
*  Well, I think it would be good to start that story with the system that existed before
*  along back in the 50s, 60s and into the 70s.
*  A lot of companies offered their workers pensions.
*  The pensions were basically the company would create a pool of assets, it would manage the
*  money, invest the money and manage it on behalf of employees.
*  And if you worked for a company long enough, you were guaranteed a fixed retirement income
*  provided by the company for the rest of your life.
*  Right.
*  And the key word there is guaranteed.
*  guaranteed that your pension would be at a certain level, essentially in perpetuity.
*  Exactly.
*  If you worked for a major steel or auto company and you spent 30 years, 40 years working on
*  the assembly line of that company, you knew that when you retired, you were going to be
*  getting a fixed monthly income from the company.
*  You knew what the amount would be.
*  And it was a huge benefit to working for these companies.
*  It was a different era, of course.
*  There was an era of lifetime employment.
*  People often spent their entire careers with the same company.
*  And people also didn't live as long.
*  From a company's point of view, pensions were affordable.
*  And it was just a very different time.
*  And it should be said that even in the heyday of pensions, only around half of all private
*  sector workers had them.
*  So they weren't as broad based as people might think.
*  And these days, there's a bit of mythologizing about that era.
*  What if you had one, it was something you cherished, and it was an era in which the
*  country seemed to do a better job of taking care of the working person?
*  Well then who would willingly give up that cherished system of the pension?
*  Well 401ks came along as almost an historical accident.
*  In the 60s and 70s, many companies were looking for ways to reward their executives.
*  Specifically, they were looking for ways that they could award bonuses to executives and
*  not have that money taxed.
*  The top marginal tax rate at the time was quite high.
*  And so some companies began offering tax-deferred savings plans to executives to help them minimize
*  their tax hit.
*  Basically the way these worked was that the company would pay bonuses directly into these
*  accounts and the executives could only take the money out when they left the company,
*  either take out their job or to retire.
*  But there was always a certain murkiness surrounding these plans.
*  It was never entirely clear that the IRS approved of them.
*  It was never entirely clear that the IRS would continue to approve of them.
*  And in 1978, Congress stepped into this vacuum when it passed a broad piece of legislation
*  that included a short provision called Section 401k that attempted to provide greater clarity
*  to how these profit sharing schemes could be established.
*  And the people who wrote the legislation didn't think that Section 401k was significant at all.
*  They thought it was just a sort of inconsequential tweak.
*  However, a retirement benefits specialist in suburban Philadelphia thought otherwise.
*  In 1979, a gentleman named Ted Benna, he had been asked by a local bank to try to devise
*  a profit sharing program that it could offer to executives.
*  Got it.
*  So in other words, they were doing that same old thing of trying to figure out how to
*  shield the taxes of highly paid executives.
*  Exactly.
*  And so there he was sitting in his office on a weekend afternoon in 1979.
*  And he started reading quite closely this Section 401k.
*  And the light bulb went off.
*  He realized that there was possibly a way to preserve this sort of system legally.
*  Instead of the company making payments directly into these accounts, you could offer them
*  as retirement plans that employees could pay into themselves.
*  The thinking was that if you paid executives big bonuses, they could choose to put that
*  money into the plan pre-tax.
*  And he sort of realized he was on to something quite big.
*  The catch was Section 401k indicated that this plan had to be made available to rank
*  and file employees at a company.
*  And that struck Benna as a challenge because it was one thing for a highly paid executive
*  to be willing to put aside some of his income in such a way.
*  But to ask a bank teller, people who tended to need the money more immediately, that was
*  going to be a big ask.
*  And solving that piece of the puzzle was a big challenge.
*  And so what was his solution?
*  His solution, and it was an ingenious one, was that the bank could offer to match a portion
*  of the contribution that an employee made.
*  So instantly would grow their money.
*  Right.
*  That's kind of a free money quality to that proposal.
*  And that this was the sweetener that could get rank and file employees to go along with
*  it.
*  In that moment, in that flash of inspiration, Ted Benna created the modern 401k, which would
*  go on to change the American economic retirement system.
*  A funny footnote to this is that the bank that had asked Benna to come up with the plan
*  rejected the plan.
*  It was concerned that the IRS would ultimately rule the scheme illegal.
*  But Benna was undeterred and decided that he would offer the plan to his own company.
*  Benna's colleagues and employees loved the plan and happily contributed to it.
*  And through word of mouth and articles in local newspapers, the idea took hold.
*  And the timing turned out to be very fortuitous.
*  How so?
*  Well for a couple reasons.
*  One, a lot of corporations had come to regard pensions as albatrosses.
*  Certainly in two industries that were best known for their pension programs, auto and
*  steel, these were industries that were in decline and their pension obligations were
*  killing them.
*  Right.
*  Because as you told us earlier, they literally guarantee a certain level of retirement.
*  Absolutely.
*  And meeting those guarantees had become increasingly onerous and particularly for companies that
*  were in dying or fading industries.
*  And so you have companies looking to get away from this pension system.
*  And the politics of that era was also a significant factor.
*  This was when Ronald Reagan is president and Reaganomics as it was called was centered
*  around the idea of individual responsibility, individual economic empowerment, and 401K's
*  shifted responsibility for retirement saving from the employer to the employee.
*  It was really up to the employee to figure out how he or she wanted the money invested.
*  And to people who were enthusiasts of 401K's, it was also an emancipatory vehicle, a chance
*  to give Americans, individuals the freedom to sort of chart their own destiny.
*  And so the 401K's fit very neatly into the politics of that moment.
*  Well, I wonder if you can walk us through the ideal version of how a 401K would have
*  been working for a worker in this era when it was being more and more adopted and workers
*  were starting to really like what they saw in this alternative to the pension.
*  Let's imagine a guy who entered the workforce in the 1980s and in honor of the father of
*  the 401K, Ted Benna, let's call this imaginary figure Ted.
*  Perfect.
*  Ted gets hired by a company.
*  Company offers a 401K plan and Ted is disciplined.
*  His father and mother have told him for years that if you want a proper retirement, you
*  need to save.
*  You can't spend everything.
*  Showing a little financial restraint is a good thing at a young age.
*  And they've given him books like The Wealthy Barber, which documents the magic of compound
*  interest.
*  So having realized that saving is important, Ted happily establishes a 401K account through
*  his company, maxes out his contribution faithfully, and the company also provides a generous match.
*  His income keeps rising as the years go by, so he's contributing more and more to his
*  401K.
*  And because he's earning a good amount of money as it is, he never needs to touch that
*  money.
*  He can leave it there for retirement, let the stock market work its magic, and the market
*  did work its magic.
*  There have been downturns over the last 20 or 30 years, but basically, sticking with
*  the stock market has proven to be a very wise bet.
*  And today, as he nears retirement, Ted is one of hundreds of thousands of Americans
*  who has more than a million dollars in his 401K.
*  Right.
*  This is the very promise of the 401K, that if you contribute early and consistently,
*  you can build a very serious nest egg over the course of your career, and you can do
*  it on your own terms.
*  Exactly.
*  From the start, there were people who wondered whether this was really a good idea.
*  Saving for retirement is essential.
*  Did it make sense to put so much of the burden on workers?
*  Is saving for retirement really a do-it-yourself endeavor?
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Michael, who specifically was warning us, pretty presciently, as it turned out,
*  that a growing reliance on the 401K for retirement was a dangerous experiment?
*  Well, one person who was warning us was an economist named Teresa Gilderucci, who teaches
*  now at the New School in New York.
*  And what's interesting about her is that she entered the workforce at around the time 401Ks
*  came along.
*  So she has tracked this for the duration of her career and has been warning about the
*  downsides of 401Ks pretty much for the duration of her career.
*  And what exactly was her worry?
*  Well, for one thing, she worried that a lot of people would never even have access to
*  401Ks, particularly lower and middle income Americans.
*  She worried that many employers would simply not offer them.
*  She also felt that even if those workers were offered 401Ks, they would not have the
*  resources or the financial knowledge to take advantage of these plans.
*  But she also saw this in moral terms.
*  She thought that the 401K represented an abdication of the social contract.
*  She believed that workers deserve to be able to retire with dignity and some degree of
*  economic security, that it was something that we owed them as a society.
*  And she saw the 401K as a betrayal of that.
*  Well, help us understand the kind of downside risk of the 401K that people like Giel Erducci
*  are starting to worry about.
*  And I wonder if you can do that by providing a counter example to Ted, who clearly represented
*  the upside of the 401K, and instead give us an example that really embodies the risks
*  of the 401K.
*  I think that would help us understand this skepticism that begins as the 401K is being
*  adopted across the American workplace.
*  Okay, let's imagine a worker named Paul.
*  The first few companies he worked for did not offer 401Ks, but his current employer does.
*  The problem, though, is that Paul doesn't make enough money to contribute to it on a
*  sustained basis.
*  He makes a mid-five-figure salary, but he's got kids, he's got lots of expenses, and he
*  can't really take advantage of this 401K.
*  He puts what he can into it, a couple thousand here and there, and there is an employer match,
*  but it doesn't add up to very much because he can't contribute a lot to it.
*  And life can throw lots of curveballs at people.
*  And in Paul's case, one of his kids has a medical emergency.
*  Health insurance won't cover everything, and he's got this money sitting there that's put
*  aside for retirement, but he needs the money now.
*  And Paul does exactly what all the retirement experts say you shouldn't do, and raids his
*  retirement fund, and the 401K ends up being a source of emergency funds for him.
*  He replenished it to a certain degree over the next 20 years, but he's now reaching retirement
*  age, and his 401K has maybe $20,000 or $30,000 in it, which is hardly enough to get him through
*  a year, let alone to sustain him for the length of his retirement.
*  And he'll have Social Security too, but it does not add up to anything like the kind
*  of nest egg one needs these days to retire on.
*  So this is the nightmare version of the 401K, where circumstances like this emergency Paul
*  as well as a lack of financial savvy and ultimately a lack of resources means that the 401K is
*  not providing a comfortable retirement.
*  In fact, it doesn't seem like much of a retirement at all.
*  No, that's exactly right.
*  Teresa feared from the start that the 401K system would disproportionately benefit people
*  who were already well to do and would leave millions of other Americans with basically
*  nothing put aside for retirement.
*  And it seems that that's where we've ended up now.
*  It's not just that millions of people who have access to 401Ks struggle to save millions
*  of other Americans don't even have access to 401Ks.
*  It's estimated that around half of all private sector employees do not have retirement savings
*  plans through their employers.
*  You have a lot of Ted's in America, people who earned enough and had the financial knowledge
*  to put aside a lot of money and who have massive nest eggs built up through their 401Ks and
*  other investment vehicles.
*  But you also have millions of Paul's who've got basically nothing and are facing, in many
*  cases dire circumstances as they approach retirement.
*  Right.
*  And what it sounds like has happened is that the 401K has just reinforced the income inequality
*  that is so present in American society.
*  And there would seem to be a little bit of an irony to all of this, Michael, which is
*  that as you said, when you described the birth of the 401K, it was created to shield high
*  paid executives bonuses from being taxed.
*  So perhaps it's not all that surprising that even as it took off and became the retirement
*  tool of the rank and file worker, the 401K remains most effective at building the wealth
*  of those who already have a fair amount of wealth.
*  That's a great point.
*  Maybe we shouldn't be surprised that something that was created to help rich guys shield
*  some of their money from taxes has ended up helping lots of rich guys become even richer.
*  So if as it turns out to bring this full circle, the 401K in a very real sense was a mistake,
*  what are we supposed to do about it?
*  Well for a long time, Gilderucci hoped we could get rid of 401Ks.
*  And in fact, at one point came up with a plan to replace 401Ks, but it didn't get very far.
*  It was an idea that was popular in progressive circles.
*  But for many years, she was a figure of scorn on the right.
*  Conservatives thought that she was attacking the very idea of the free market and of individual
*  choice.
*  Lately, though, some conservatives have had a change of heart.
*  Some significant voices on the right have even conceded that she actually had a point
*  about the flaws of the current retirement system.
*  Who are those voices on the right suddenly agreeing with her?
*  Well one prominent figure is Kevin Hassett, a well known conservative economist who served
*  as one of Donald Trump's chief economic advisors when he was president.
*  After Hassett left the White House, he took an interest in the economics of retirement
*  in the United States.
*  And he became concerned that millions of Americans were indeed falling through the cracks of
*  the retirement system.
*  Hassett has been concerned for some time that the country was drifting towards socialism.
*  And so he felt that doing something to help lower and middle income Americans put aside
*  money for retirement, basically it would be a way of not just helping millions of Americans,
*  but of restoring their faith in the capitalist system.
*  From what you're saying, he saw the American retirement situation in the US as a betrayal
*  of a different kind, not a betrayal of the concept that corporations owe their workers
*  a retirement, but a betrayal of the concept that people could believe that a capitalist
*  system would provide for them in their retirement.
*  Exactly.
*  As Hassett dug deeper into the economics of retirement, he became familiar with Gilder
*  Ducey's work and he reached out to her to strike up a conversation.
*  And they came up with a quite bold plan for addressing the needs of lower and middle income
*  Americans who don't have enough put aside for retirement.
*  And what is their plan?
*  This product of these two unlikely bedfellows actually look like?
*  They came up with a really intriguing idea.
*  The government has a program called the Thrift Savings Plan, which is available to all federal
*  employees and all members of uniformed services.
*  It is like the 401k, a defined contribution plan.
*  People set up individual retirement savings accounts.
*  They put money into it and the government provides a match.
*  Gilder Ducey and Hassett had the idea that you could extend this program to other Americans,
*  to people who didn't have 401k plans or other retirement savings vehicles through their
*  employers and they could put money in and the government could provide a match up to
*  a certain percentage and up to a certain income threshold.
*  This would allow millions of Americans currently locked out of the retirement system to start
*  building nest eggs.
*  So in this plan, instead of your company providing a 401k or a match for your retirement, it
*  would instead be the federal government.
*  Exactly.
*  And this plan has gained traction on Capitol Hill.
*  In fact, there is now legislation before Congress that is based on Gilder Ducey and Hassett's
*  plan.
*  And it has bipartisan sponsorship.
*  It underscores the point that despite the toxicity of our current politics, there is
*  growing agreement across the ideological divide that something needs to be done to help more
*  Americans save for retirement.
*  But Michael, here I think I have to pause and reflect on the fact that this entire episode
*  has been about the shortcomings of the 401k.
*  And so I have to ask, why would a program that embraces a 401k style approach be the
*  solution to a problem that the 401k itself seemed to create?
*  Well, I don't think anyone would say that this program is going to make everyone in
*  the neighborhood a millionaire, but it is going to provide more Americans with something
*  of a nest egg, something they can retire on.
*  That's the hope anyway.
*  It's about trying to help more Americans put aside enough money that they can possibly
*  retire with some degree of economic security and dignity.
*  The key point is participation.
*  You want to give people access to a retirement plan, give them an incentive to take advantage
*  of it.
*  Right, the match.
*  The match is a crucial part of this.
*  Seeing your money grow instantly through the match, whether it's from your company or from
*  the government, is a huge incentive to actually participate.
*  And so this could make a significant difference.
*  It really feels like the saga of the 401k ends up being like so many questions in the
*  States, where there's this huge, seemingly unresolvable tension between a collective
*  problem, the need for a comfortable life after work for millions of people, and a solution
*  that, as currently designed, relies on the individual to make it happen.
*  And even the program that expands the government 401k to all Americans that we just discussed
*  doesn't seem like it's really going to resolve that inherent tension.
*  No it won't.
*  And at the end of the day, this all comes down to a very basic question.
*  Should we think of retirement as a privilege or as a right?
*  In the 1950s, 60s and into the 70s, the heyday of pensions, it seemed that we were moving
*  towards an answer.
*  And the answer was that it was a right.
*  The 401k system seems to have taken us in the other direction.
*  And so long as we live in a world where it's considered a privilege, it's going to put
*  a lot of the onus on workers themselves.
*  And that's a very hard problem to solve for, with policy measures and perks.
*  It ultimately comes down to whether individuals have access to retirement plans, and if they
*  have enough money and discipline to contribute to them on a regular basis.
*  Well Michael, thank you very much.
*  We really appreciate this.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  The president and foreign minister of Iran are presumed dead after their helicopter crashed
*  in the country's northwest.
*  The cause is unknown, but it occurred in bad weather and thick fog, which made search
*  and rescue operations difficult.
*  The crash comes at a fraught moment for Iran.
*  It recently launched its first direct attack on Israel, suffered a devastating terrorist
*  attack, and faced massive protests against its government.
*  And...
*  Over the weekend, a key member of Israel's war cabinet, Benny Gantz, presented the country's
*  prime minister with an ultimatum.
*  Unless the government of Benjamin Netanyahu quickly develops a plan to end the war in
*  Gaza, Gantz said that he would quit the cabinet.
*  In a televised speech, Gantz accused Netanyahu of quote, dragging the country into the abyss.
*  In response, Netanyahu accused Gantz of betraying Israel and essentially calling for its defeat
*  to Hamas.
