# Trump’s Cash Crunch
**New York Times Podcasts:** [February 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVzWsy12Rcc)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro. This is The Daily.
*  Last week, when a civil court judge in New York ruled against Donald Trump, he imposed
*  a set of penalties so severe that they could temporarily sever Trump from his real estate
*  empire and wipe out all of his cash. Today, my colleagues Jonah Bromwich and Maggie Haberman
*  explain what that will mean for Trump the businessman and Trump the candidate.
*  It's Friday, February 23rd. Jonah and Maggie, thank you for coming in.
*  Thanks for having us.
*  Thank you.
*  So last week, the judge overseeing one of the many cases against Donald Trump issued
*  a ruling that, put simply, was a bombshell. The single most devastating penalty, really
*  ever, against the former president. And that's what we want to talk to you about, the fallout
*  from that ruling. And we turn to you, Jonah, because you have covered the case day to day
*  in the courtroom for months, and Maggie, because you know Trump arguably better than anyone
*  as one of his biographers. Jonah, just to start, remind us what this case was fundamentally
*  about.
*  So, this case is about fraud, and specifically, the New York Attorney General accused Donald
*  Trump, his company, of exaggerating the value of their properties. That includes golf clubs,
*  apartment buildings. What the AG said that Trump did was take those things, say that
*  they were much more valuable than they actually were, and as a result, got better loan terms
*  from banks, from insurers, profiting from what they said was fraud.
*  And in a lot of ways, the case became a stand-in for the broader question that has hung over
*  him for years, which is, is he a fraud?
*  Not just did he commit fraud, but is he a fraud?
*  Is he personally a fraud, and is this empire that he built over decades, and this public
*  persona that he built over decades, essentially built on a foundation of lies?
*  And Jonah, we knew really early on that the judge in this case was finding against Trump.
*  That happened months ago. And the question was always around the penalties that were
*  going to be levied against Trump. So, Jonah, having covered the case day in, day out in
*  the courtroom, just talk us through at a very high level what those penalties were,
*  and then I think we're going to walk through them one by one in more detail.
*  Sure. So the first penalty is a cash penalty, and it's enormous. It started out as $355
*  million, so that's already a pretty sizable number.
*  But then we're looking at interest on top of that, which actually vaults it all the
*  way to $450 million.
*  Wow, nearly half a billion bucks.
*  It's just as simple as that. Donald Trump now owes $450 million from this case alone.
*  There's bans on Trump running his company. There's bans on him getting loans from New
*  York banks. And then they've installed a monitor at the Trump Organization, which sounds as
*  if it's maybe a little bit less of a big deal than those other two, but in fact, as I think
*  we'll talk about, is a very big deal.
*  Okay. I want to start, Jonah, with the eye-popping financial penalty in this case. So just walk
*  us through it.
*  Sure. So one of the big things to know here is that this is not a fine. This is not the
*  judge who was the one who decided it, saying, Donald Trump did these bad things, and thus
*  I'm going to fine him this enormous amount. This is what's called disgorgement. And what
*  it really is, is the calculation of how much money Trump made through fraud. So at trial,
*  the attorney general said, we believe that it was about $370 million plus interest, and
*  the judge did his own calculations. They're in the ruling. And he found that it was very,
*  very close to that. So about $355 million with interest becomes something like $450
*  million.
*  Huge number. Can you just walk us through how you can possibly calculate that somebody's
*  lies about their property value represent $350 or I guess $400 with interest, million
*  dollars worth of basically ill-gotten gains?
*  So one of the interesting things in this case is that you don't have traditional victims,
*  but the banks are kind of the stanzas for the victims. These are the entities that would
*  have made more money had Trump not gotten the terms that he got. So the way that this
*  is calculated is you look at the banks lost profits. That's an enormous amount of the
*  disgorgement. Add that to interest. And then the recent sale of two properties that was
*  also aided by the fraud.
*  Two properties sold by Trump.
*  That's right. And that's where you get this number.
*  Okay. So the thinking is, if Trump had properly valued the properties he was getting the loans
*  for, then the banks would have made more money. And therefore, in a sense, the judge
*  is taking that money from Trump and giving it now to the banks?
*  No, it goes to New York State. That's the funny thing because the banks weren't set
*  up as victims in the way this works. So they say to Trump, you made X amount of money from
*  your fraud. No one should be allowed to make money from fraud in New York State. We want
*  the marketplace to work. Thus, to deter other bad actors in this marketplace, we're going
*  to take that money from you and we're going to give it to the good people of New York
*  State.
*  Got it. And Maggie, this number, $450 million or so, huge on paper, but help us understand
*  what it means to Donald Trump, whose wealth has always been something of a moving target.
*  Yeah, it's huge in the wallet, too. Our understanding, mine, Jonah's, and our colleague Ben Protest's
*  understanding from looking at documents and talking to sources is that he has a little
*  under $400 million in liquid assets.
*  Less than he now owes.
*  That's correct. It's not nothing, but it's less than he now owes. And that's just in
*  one case. There's another case where he has a judgment as well.
*  Right, the E. Jim Carrow case where he owes I think about $83 million.
*  $83 million plus interest. So it is a staggering amount of money. He testified in a deposition
*  last year that he had about $400 million in cash. Let's say that that was true. We can't
*  verify that. It's still not enough.
*  Jonah, he's not going to go bankrupt over this, but how do you meet a financial obligation
*  this big when your cash situation doesn't really allow for it?
*  It's a really difficult thing to do. His net worth is really bound up in these properties.
*  And so he has a couple of different ways to address this. One is to get a bond, which
*  essentially means having someone vouch for him that he will eventually pay this money
*  if the ruling is upheld on appeal. That's the easiest way to do it, but it's not quite
*  as easy as you might think. He has to find someone to vouch for him. He probably has
*  to put up collateral either in the form of a building or in a huge amount of money or
*  promises. So that's really difficult. And then if he doesn't, he might actually have
*  to resort to liquidating one of the buildings, which again, not as easy as it sounds.
*  Right. Maggie, is it right to think that no matter how he eventually, and I suspect we
*  all think he will eventually be able to put together the money to pay this penalty, that
*  this is kind of humiliating for somebody whose identity is so bound up in wealth?
*  There's no question. It's both humiliating and infuriating in terms of his sense of being
*  unmasked to a degree as we are all sitting here talking about what it's actually worth.
*  That's a big problem for him psychologically. It always has been because he is very aware
*  of the impact this can have on how he sells himself and presents himself and also the
*  reality of what this means for his company, a company that has remained in New York all
*  this time, even as he became a Florida resident.
*  OK, so that is the money and it's messy.
*  The second element I want to understand is this decision to bar Trump from running the
*  Trump Organization. And I know it also is a ban against his two sons being involved
*  in the company as well. So just walk us through that.
*  It seems like it would be very hard to take the Trumps out of the Trump Organization.
*  So here's what we do know. Donald Trump, who is no longer really running the business of
*  the company on a day in day out basis, but still owns it.
*  He was banned from serving as the leader of a New York company for three years.
*  His two sons, including Eric Trump, who is the day in day out leader of the Trump
*  Organization, they're banned for two years.
*  And so that's one of the big question marks here.
*  What exactly does it mean when the person who runs this major part of the Trump
*  Organization may not be allowed to run this major part of the Trump Organization?
*  How will the company continue to function?
*  Right. Well, Maggie, what's your sense of the answer to that?
*  I mean, how knowing what you know about the Trump Organization, does it function when
*  dad and two sons, the owner of the company, basically, and the two people most identified
*  as its leaders, have been told by a court, don't run the company?
*  It's complicated. People want to meet with the Trumps.
*  People want to meet with the former president.
*  Donald Trump is, you know, the most famous name in the world.
*  When people want something out of this company, they are going to want to have the
*  feeling that they are meeting with a member of the family because it is a family company.
*  And can they?
*  Well, that's a complicated question.
*  I think we don't really know the answer.
*  And I think a lot of that is going to get worked out as we go by the monitor who is
*  overseeing the company.
*  And I think that you will see the attorney general watching that process very closely.
*  The company will still exist.
*  But the question remains that without the Trumps as the people leading it or seen as
*  leading it, we don't know what kind of deals they're going to be able to strike.
*  We don't know where this goes.
*  Yeah.
*  And this is where the third punishment, the monitor really comes in.
*  Right, Meg, you just mentioned the monitor.
*  Just explain what a monitor is, what it does, and how it fits into the new universe of
*  the Trump Organization given this ruling.
*  So this monitor is a former federal judge.
*  Her name is Barbara Jones, and she's essentially a corporate babysitter.
*  She overlooks everything that the Trump Organization may want to do regarding its
*  finances, and she's checking for fraud.
*  She's looking at particular transactions and really scrutinizing them.
*  And the Trump Organization as a private company has just never undergone this level of
*  scrutiny before.
*  So when they're trying to maneuver and think about how they want to go about doing
*  their business, continuing to make money, continuing to run the company, they're going
*  to have this person overseeing their every move.
*  And to be clear, that was by design.
*  The judge specifically noted in his ruling that Trump had expressed very little remorse
*  for the fraud that he found and in fact had continued to commit it.
*  And so the monitor is there because the judge simply does not trust Donald Trump.
*  And that was made completely explicit.
*  How does Donald Trump, Maggie, and how do his sons regard having a government
*  monitor in their midst?
*  Not happily, Michael.
*  I analogize it to a moment in yet another court case that Donald Trump is facing, the
*  investigation into his possession of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, where
*  according to court filings, he said to one of his lawyers, I really don't want people
*  going through my boxes.
*  And those boxes were the boxes of documents.
*  And he didn't want his lawyer and others looking through my boxes.
*  It's mine.
*  My company, my government, my possessions.
*  He does not want an outside monitor there.
*  Right.
*  If you don't want your own lawyer going through the federal government papers, oh, to
*  the federal government, you don't want a monitor looking over your shoulders as you
*  run your company.
*  And then the crazy thing about the monitor is we think of all these penalties as these
*  discrete things.
*  There's the financial penalty.
*  There's the bans.
*  Then there's the monitor.
*  But they all work together in this really difficult way for the Trump organization
*  because they're trying to scrounge up money.
*  They're trying to figure out who will run the company.
*  And all the while, they have a monitor who's answerable to the judge, making their
*  lives slower, more complicated and ultimately more difficult.
*  And I think when you think about the punishments, it's actually important not to
*  think of them as separate, but really to think about how they complicate each other,
*  how the penalty complicates the monitor, complicates the bans and who runs the Trump
*  organization and how Donald Trump feels about it.
*  God, these all interlock, but not in a complimentary way, but like a hand in the
*  gears kind of way.
*  So if you're Trump, if you decide that to pay this 450 million dollar penalty, you
*  want to sell a building, correct me if I'm wrong, Jonah, the monitor might look over
*  your shoulders and say, no, not that building.
*  And so suddenly Trump's plan to actually pay the penalty gets mucked up by the
*  monitor.
*  I think it's safe to assume that the monitor is going to be involved in all kinds of
*  different things in ways that just make Trump's life fundamentally unpleasant.
*  Right.
*  I mean, the image that's coming to my head is the one from watching Trump in the
*  reality TV show, right?
*  Like you're fired.
*  And what it now feels the reality of Trump is, is a guy saying you're fired, but I
*  really can't run the company and I can only fire you if the monitor says I can fire
*  you.
*  Right.
*  That's basically, as Jonah said, his hands are essentially tied.
*  As much as he liked projecting this image of a guy who, you know, what he says goes
*  and his orders go and whatever he says the boss is in charge, he really can't do that
*  now.
*  I mean, to the extent that it ever was that way at the Trump organization, it really
*  is not now.
*  And so a very important piece of his public image, and I think frankly his self image
*  at this point, has been stripped away from him.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Maggie, we've been talking about how this penalty is going to hurt Trump as a
*  businessman and just as a rich guy who is about to be less rich.
*  But I want you to explain what it means to Trump as the de facto Republican nominee
*  for president to have a penalty of this scale.
*  On the one hand, it very much feels like a ruling like this fits into Trump's
*  narrative that the Democratic blue state establishment is out to get him.
*  On the other hand, as you've started to hint at, a big part of Trump's appeal was
*  that he is a hugely successful businessman.
*  And this very much undercuts that by saying you were a fraud.
*  So how should we think about what this penalty does to Trump, the candidate?
*  In terms of how he appeals to his base of voters, it's very helpful to him.
*  And frankly, in terms of appealing to even business people who might be center
*  right, but on the fence about Trump, like some of his policies, a lot of them
*  identify with him on this and think that he's being treated unfairly.
*  Is it because of the number?
*  It's because of the state coming and taking your business, which is how he is
*  going to continue to present this.
*  He is not going to present it as they came after me for fraudulent tactics.
*  It's going to be, I ran a successful company and they're coming after me.
*  And that's been every single one of his fundraising emails about this topic.
*  Right.
*  I actually got one of those emails, Maggie.
*  I want to read the language from it.
*  This is from a Donald Trump fundraising email that came right after this finding.
*  Do you support president Trump more or less after every single witch hunt, raid,
*  indictment and arrest that the radical left has thrown at him?
*  He's saying this is like every single one of the other ones.
*  Well, part of his strategy, Michael has been to smear all of these court cases
*  with one facade, right?
*  Which is that this is essentially the state coming at me.
*  And so this plays into that and you will see him continue to say that.
*  However, to your question, it does take a bit of an ax to the self image that he
*  has continued to put out there.
*  And I think you will see president Biden and Democrats focusing on that.
*  Focusing on how?
*  Focusing on it by highlighting that a court just found him guilty of widespread fraud.
*  I think you were going to hear Democrats saying, this is how he ran his business
*  and he can't run his own business for three years.
*  Why should he be allowed to run the country for four years?
*  You're going to hear something like that.
*  And they're going to try to tie it to the economy.
*  The economy is what most voters vote on.
*  And they'll try to suggest that he is bad with money.
*  And because he is bad with money, he should not be in charge of the
*  U S government and your money.
*  And I think whether that will be successful or not, I don't know, but I
*  think that's where this is going.
*  John, I want to turn to the idea of the animated activated Trump base of voters
*  who sees this penalty as the latest invitation to show their support for Trump.
*  Technically speaking on paper, could Trump harness that anger to basically
*  fundraise his way out of the financial hole he's now in?
*  Could he set up a legal defense fund?
*  Could he ask supporters to basically bail him out of this?
*  Hypothetically speaking, a hundred percent.
*  He can absolutely do that.
*  The one thing that I think he could not do is tell people that the money is for
*  a different purpose than it is.
*  But if he's upfront about what this money is for and given what Maggie said, I
*  don't see that there's any reason not to be upfront.
*  He can set up a legal defense fund and see if he can raise some money.
*  Now, whether he can actually raise that money.
*  And this is a good question for Maggie, I think just for this particular problem.
*  That's another question.
*  Maggie.
*  Well, it's money that in theory could be going to his campaign.
*  Right.
*  And so his campaign is already underfunded compared to president Biden's.
*  And we saw that again in numbers that came out in recent days.
*  So I think he is going to have to make choices if that's the route he takes.
*  Right.
*  Every dollar you ask someone to give you for your legal defense fund in this case
*  is potentially a dollar that doesn't go to the campaign that, as you're saying, is
*  already falling behind Joe Biden in terms of fundraising.
*  Correct.
*  And so this is a low dollar fundraising base that he has gone to over and over
*  and over again.
*  His donors.
*  His own donors.
*  And they've been asked to rise up and defend him over and over and over again.
*  Fatigue may be inevitable.
*  And so at a certain point, you know, there are choices that will have to be
*  made with eight months left of this campaign and him as the likely nominee.
*  Just to think of this another way, this judgment alone, just the New York A.G.
*  case, putting aside the E.G.
*  and Carol case, just the New York A.G.
*  case is nearly half a billion dollars.
*  A presidential nomination for a general election candidate.
*  That campaign generally costs about a billion dollars.
*  So it's about half the cost of a presidential run in 2024.
*  So if you put them together, you're saying it's going to be a lot to ask the
*  American people, even Trump's most fervent supporters, to hand over one point
*  five billion, which would be the cost of a campaign, as well as bailing him out
*  of this legal predicament.
*  It's a lot of money.
*  I want to turn to a delicate, but really interesting question, which is, what does
*  it look like for Trump to run for president and potentially win back the presidency
*  when he's basically out of cash?
*  And does that create a new set of incentives for him when he's president that
*  we should be thinking about?
*  Well, you know, just on the simplistic level, he would get free housing and free
*  transportation.
*  So put that aside.
*  It's so hard to answer because when he was president, starting in 2017, he never
*  put the company to blind trust.
*  They stopped doing foreign deals and his sons took over, but there were all sorts
*  of foreign officials who stayed at the Trump hotel.
*  And that was seen as a backdoor way of getting foreign money to Trump.
*  And remember, it's not just the second he becomes president, there's eight months
*  left of a presidential race where he's the likely nominee and there could be
*  foreign governments or foreign entities that are going to try to curry favor with
*  him by doing deals now.
*  You're saying if you're a business who wants to get in the good graces of the
*  next president of the United States, this is a good moment because he's not president
*  and can do a deal and those companies would know that he needs money.
*  Correct.
*  I mean, I was going to say just speaking very hypothetically, we know what Trump's
*  past behavior is and we know what the incentives here would be.
*  And we're really looking at uncharted landscape in terms of what this might
*  actually look like.
*  I think that these are guesses.
*  We should emphasize that there are guesses.
*  We have no idea what will actually happen, but there is a theoretical case.
*  They're well-informed guesses.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Got it.
*  We've talked a lot, Maggie, especially with you, about how reelection for Trump
*  has been key to his plan for solving the legal problems he has in so many
*  different cases.
*  The idea is he could win.
*  He could ask his future attorney general to drop the federal cases against him,
*  the classified documents case, the January 6th case.
*  Civil cases and local cases like this case would seem to be more complicated.
*  So does becoming president do anything to alleviate the unique burdens of this
*  case and this penalty?
*  Short answer is no.
*  I mean, one thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other.
*  Now you are correct.
*  We have had any number of conversations about the impact that him winning a
*  second term could impact the federal cases against him, and there are two.
*  But there's also two state cases in addition to this particular case is a
*  civil case.
*  The E.G.
*  and Carol case is a civil case.
*  There is nothing he can do about that.
*  Now, could becoming president slow down the gears of certain things?
*  In theory, yes.
*  Again, we are facing such a new dynamic here with all of this, were he to become
*  president again, that I don't even know how to fathom how half of this would work.
*  But the short answer is he does not have a magic wand as president to impact these
*  cases.
*  But in a way, you'd rather be president if you're in this situation than not be
*  president.
*  I think he discovered through all of the legal trip veils he faced while he was
*  president, it was better to be president.
*  And not.
*  But what's really interesting kind of about where we are now and what we're
*  talking about is it is different for him to be after this case and in this moment
*  facing actual consequences of this type where the penalty has already been
*  demanded of him.
*  Trump seems to face a lot of heat, but he always gets out of it.
*  You know, he gets out of these bankruptcies.
*  He gets out of the Access Hollywood tape during the 2016 election.
*  He gets out of the impeachment twice.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  But here we already have the consequences demanded of him and it seems highly
*  unlikely right as he's running for president again that he's going to be able
*  to get out of paying these things or dealing with them in some way.
*  Well, Maggie, Jonah, thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  The mother of Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader who has died in prison,
*  said that the government has refused to release her son's remains unless she
*  agrees to a secret funeral that would draw no public attention.
*  In a video, Lyudmila Navalnaya accused the government of Vladimir Putin of
*  illegally blackmailing her by quote, telling me where, when and how Alexei
*  should be buried.
*  Meanwhile, during a fundraiser, President Biden called Putin a quote, crazy
*  SOB, his harshest language to date for the Russian leader.
*  In response, the Kremlin dismissed Biden's remarks as quote, Hollywood
*  cowboy style behavior designed to win him reelection.
