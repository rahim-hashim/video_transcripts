# What the Houthis Really Want
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmh1Tg10zQ4)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Boboro. This is The Daily.
*  Over the past few months, attacks by Houthi militants on global trade and the Western
*  military, which once seemed like a dangerous sideshow to the war in Gaza, have become a
*  full-blown crisis.
*  Today, my colleague, Gulf Bureau Chief, Vivian Niran, on what the Houthis really want.
*  It's Thursday, January 18th.
*  There's a marked escalation of tensions along one of the world's busiest shipping routes.
*  Houthi militants claimed responsibility for yet another attack on a container ship.
*  The latest target of Yemen's Houthis, Norwegian tanker Strinda, struck by a missile.
*  A U.S. warship shot down 14 drones fired by suspected Houthi rebels in Yemen.
*  The escalation of attacks have encouraged a series of shipping companies to announce
*  they would suspend their movements through the Red Sea.
*  A United States official tells CNN the U.S. military has carried out strikes on multiple
*  Houthi targets in Yemen. This war could be escalating big time.
*  The Pentagon confirms it has carried out more strikes against the Yemen-based Houthi rebels,
*  the third assault on the group in recent days.
*  Houthi leaders said this aggression will not go unanswered, threatening to keep on attacking
*  those ships that are passing through the Red Sea.
*  President Biden's saying he will not hesitate to act further if that continues.
*  Vivian, over the past few weeks, as militants in Yemen have carried out this really unusual
*  military campaign against commercial ships in the Red Sea, and have basically crippled
*  this trade route and triggered a very significant military response from the U.S. and its allies,
*  the question I think all of us have had with increasing urgency is what exactly has motivated
*  these militants, the Houthis, to do this?
*  What do they want?
*  And how do these attacks in the Red Sea serve that cause?
*  Well, the Houthi's stated motivation has from the start been all about the Palestinians
*  and Gaza and sort of forcing Israel to end its siege on Gaza. They have for a very long
*  time kind of centered opposition to Israel and hostility towards the United States and
*  the Palestinian cause in their narrative and in their ideology. And they've really been
*  kind of bringing that up. They've essentially been saying, you know, look at what Israel
*  is doing to the Palestinians. No one is standing up for them. None of the other Arab governments
*  have really done anything. You know, they're not doing an oil embargo. They're not going
*  to war. And that we essentially, and they represent themselves as, you know, the Yemeni
*  government, we are the only state in the region that is doing anything about this, that is
*  taking on Israel and the United States.
*  So the way that they're pushing all of this messaging out to the world is through their
*  incredibly robust wartime propaganda. They produce these music videos and songs and poems.
*  You know, they're very active on social media, especially on X and TikTok.
*  What exactly do these social media messages that they're putting out say?
*  They've released really catchy songs in Arabic.
*  They kind of say things like, oh, you know, we're Yemeni, but our blood is Palestinian.
*  They have done things like put up, you know, Twitter polls, essentially saying, you know,
*  who are you on the side of? Are you on the side of genocide in America? Or are you on
*  the side of, you know, the brave Yemenis fighting genocide and standing up for justice essentially?
*  And that's a Twitter poll that they put out in English.
*  Wow.
*  Kind of just trying to sort of speak to a different audience. So that has become again
*  a very important tool for them.
*  So what the Houthis say they want and what's captured in these propaganda videos that you
*  just described is to use these attacks to pressure Israel and Israel's allies, primarily
*  the U.S., into ending Israel's military operation in Gaza. That's what they claim this is all
*  about.
*  Yes, that's exactly what they say.
*  Okay. So that's what the Houthis want everyone to see as their animating cause. Is that based
*  on your reporting, based on your long-term understanding of the Houthis, is it that straightforward?
*  Is that the reality of what is really motivating them?
*  No, I think their behavior and their motivations are much more complicated than that. I mean,
*  the Houthis ultimately want relevance, they want power, they have a lot of domestic aims.
*  And in so many ways, the war in Gaza has really been just this huge gift from the sky for
*  them. It enables them to achieve so many of their own aims. And I can't even describe
*  to you how strange it is as somebody who's covered the Houthis for many years, and they
*  were this really just little-known group. To see how prominent they are and how much
*  people who really know almost nothing about Yemen now talk about them and know who they
*  are all over the world.
*  Well, tell us that story of who the Houthis are, where they come from, and how the operation
*  that they are now conducting that has really kind of menaced the Red Sea and much of the
*  West and its economy, how it achieves its real goals.
*  You know, it's funny, I actually, I went back in the times past to see like if we'd written
*  about the early history of the Houthis and we had like, we had almost nothing about them
*  before even the mid 2000s, which was interesting to me. So essentially, the Houthis history
*  as a movement dates back to the 1990s. They take their name from their tribe, which is
*  this extended clan whose home territories in the mountains of northern Yemen near the
*  border with Saudi Arabia. And they follow the subset of Shia Islam and say that they're
*  the descendants of the Prophet Muhammad. So when they began their movement, they were
*  really sort of a cultural and religious revivalist group that later became quite political. And
*  they gained prominence essentially as this tribally based resistance movement to the
*  Yemeni government at the time. And they very much portrayed themselves as fighting against
*  corruption, fighting against foreign influence. And their rise to prominence really coincided
*  with the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. And they really absorbed that invasion, which
*  was incredibly unpopular, you know, throughout the Middle East and among Arab countries,
*  they sort of saw this as an incredibly destabilizing military incursion into their region that
*  they did not support. Right. And the Houthis really seized on that and on sort of general
*  rising anti-Americanism and incorporated that battling foreign influence really deep into
*  their ideology. Right. And of course, the war in Iraq was about as clear a case of a
*  foreign power stepping into their neighborhood, as you could possibly imagine.
*  Right. Yeah. And for them, you know, they really saw US influence in their own country as
*  well, because the long time Yemeni ruler who they were fighting against was this US allied
*  autocrat. He had been in power for more than 30 years. Very repressive, very corrupt government
*  and very unpopular. And they were for a long time fighting against him. So Yemen is already
*  in this really kind of destabilized moment around 2010 and 2011, when the Arab Spring
*  arrives all over the region. There are these sort of revolutions toppling strongmen. Right.
*  And one of the strongmen who gets toppled is Ali Abdullah Saleh, the Yemeni leader,
*  and this sort of like fit of popular anger. Now, what happened over the next couple of
*  years was really chaotic. And eventually, the Houthis saw an opportunity. And in 2014,
*  they seized control of the Yemeni capital of Sana'a. And they sort of installed themselves
*  as the alternative.
*  So now that this clan from the northern mountains of Yemen has taken over the capital and the
*  institutions, I would imagine, of Yemen's government, what does the world make of that?
*  Well, it's something that pretty immediately made Saudi Arabia, Yemen's much larger neighbor
*  to the north, very nervous and concerned. Why? The Houthis are essentially a militia,
*  right? They're this kind of religiously inspired militia. And that alone was enough to make
*  Saudi Arabia nervous. They have this very long border with Yemen. They did not want a militia
*  on the other side of the border. But perhaps equally as important to that is the fact that
*  the Houthis had become aligned with Iran, which is Saudi Arabia's regional rival. And Saudi Arabia
*  was very worried about the idea of this Iran-influenced militia, potentially Iran-supported militia,
*  taking over this large chunk of its southern border and what that would mean and the sense
*  of being sort of crunched in by Iran-influenced proxies from different sides. So basically,
*  in early 2015, Saudi Arabia gets together a coalition of Arab governments and the Saudi
*  led coalition starts a bombing campaign in Yemen.
*  A direct strike in broad daylight. It's too graphic to show in full, but the bodies being
*  pulled out belong to three-month-old Samoud and her three-year-old brother, Ndi.
*  A bombing campaign that much of the world eventually comes to see as really intensive,
*  gruesome and lethal. Right. Residents say Saudi warplanes have dropped more than a hundred
*  bombs in civilian neighborhoods over the past few days. Yemen was already one of the Arab world's
*  poorest countries and this war essentially pitched it into one of the world's worst humanitarian
*  crises. United Nations officials are warning that Yemen faces famine on a scale the world has not
*  seen in decades. They are talking of millions of victims. This has been a tremendous loss of life.
*  There have been cholera outbreaks. It's a great humanitarian crisis. Many, many people are dying.
*  It's this incredibly brutal war. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has appealed for urgent
*  action to stop Yemen from descending into anarchy. Yemen is collapsing before our eyes. We cannot
*  stand by and watch. And the US was actually quite important to that war in the beginning.
*  The Obama administration provided military support and intelligence to the Saudi-led coalition,
*  refueling planes. Of course, many of the weapons that they were dropping were American weapons.
*  So again, this kind of starts to fuel that sense from the Houthis and from many Yemenis that
*  they are, you know, being conspired against by foreign powers.
*  And why, Vivian, does the United States get involved in this battle?
*  Much of it seems to be because Saudi Arabia was such an important and is such an important US
*  ally. And the Yemeni government at the time, of course, was also US-backed. So initially,
*  the US was supportive of this goal of restoring the legitimate Yemeni government. Over time,
*  the US support for the war really began to fray and become quite controversial.
*  And you started to see a lot of political pressure in Washington for the US to pull back its support
*  and sort of fears that the US was implicated in that destruction. And so basically, from around
*  2018 and 2019 onwards, the war loses its international support. And, you know, Saudi Arabia
*  and the coalition members find themselves sort of on the back foot, and they gradually start to sort
*  of pull back their involvement in the war. Got it. And where does this leave the Houthis?
*  This essentially leaves the Houthis in power. It's really kind of incredible that they started as
*  this underdog force, this ragtag militia fighting in flip-flops. And, you know, by 2021, 2022,
*  they are essentially the dominant power in Yemen. And they're feeling quite confident. They're
*  essentially feeling like they won the war. So how do we get from this unlikely victory
*  that the Houthis have over major powers, Saudi Arabia, the United States,
*  to a campaign of bombing and attacks in the Red Sea that would seem to endanger
*  all that the Houthis gained in that prolonged war?
*  So you have to really remember that since they were founded, the Houthis have been
*  a resistance movement. They've been rebels. That's been their entire identity. And so a rebel force
*  doesn't really naturally then lend itself to becoming a government. They are now the powers
*  that be in Yemen. There's nothing left for them to resist. So they're in this very uncomfortable
*  position in a lot of ways as 2023 rolls around. And people are looking at them to provide basic
*  services. They're looking at them to provide electricity and water. They're looking at them
*  to pay salaries for civil servants who, in many cases, have gone unpaid for years. And that's
*  quite a lot of pressure on the Houthis. And no doubt to rebuild the entire country.
*  And they also do need to rebuild the entire country, which is really in ruins. And all of
*  that is quite expensive. And it's not really clear how they're going to navigate their way out of
*  that. Right. This is sort of the context that October 7th rolls around in. The Houthis are in
*  this difficult position. They're facing this kind of prospect of transitioning into a peacetime
*  government, which is going to be very challenging. And in that context, October 7th comes out of
*  nowhere. And suddenly, there's potentially an answer to a lot of their problems.
*  Well, just explain that. How does Hamas attacking Israel, and Israel obviously preparing a ferocious
*  response, how does that potentially solve all of the Houthi problems you just outlined?
*  Well, it puts the Houthis at the center of this moment in the region where there's just anger all
*  across the Arab world. And the Houthis really insert themselves into that. And they take it up
*  as an opportunity to really live out their narrative to finally directly enter a war with
*  Israel, you know, which is their declared great enemy. Right. So once the Houthis directly enter
*  this conflict, they're shooting missiles at Israel, they're attacking ships in the Red Sea,
*  their popularity at home skyrockets, they find themselves in a situation where they can use this
*  to recruit more fighters.
*  There are enormous rallies that they're holding in the streets of Sana'a of people coming out
*  in solidarity with the Palestinians, you know, protesting against the Israeli bombardment of Gaza.
*  They're just, he's huge crowds of people holding up their slogan, holding up images of the Houthi
*  leader. And it's really quite a galvanizing moment for them.
*  So ultimately, this, you're saying is what the Houthis really want. This is that complicated set
*  of motivations behind their decision to start hurling missiles into the Red Sea. The Houthis
*  may say that what they're doing is just about defending the Palestinians and trying to end
*  Israel's war in Gaza, but it is multi-pronged. And what the Houthis really want is a simpler way
*  to win the hearts and minds of their own people than being the government of Yemen.
*  Right. I mean, the Houthis have pushed back against that narrative a lot. They're arguing
*  that they're not doing this for popularity, that it's not about domestic reasons, you know,
*  and they say this is a true moral crusade. We're fighting for justice. But the reality is that on
*  the ground, they have benefited a lot in a lot of different ways. So it almost doesn't matter
*  to what extent they believe the ideology that they're espousing. On the ground, there has been a
*  massive benefit to them. And all of that means that the Houthis would seem to have virtually
*  no motivation to stop doing what they're doing, battling the West in the Red Sea.
*  Not at all. There's really no reason for them to pull back and they're very comfortable fighting.
*  And that's what they're doing right now. As soon as it stops, it essentially leaves the Houthis back
*  in a challenging position where they're going to have to figure out how to govern. They're going
*  to have to figure out how to be in power and not how to be the rebels. For the Houthis, it is going
*  to be much easier to keep fighting than it would be for them to govern a country that has been
*  destroyed by decades of war. We'll be right back.
*  Vivian, as the Houthis wage these ongoing attacks, it clearly puts the US in a really complicated
*  spot based on everything you just said. Because at some point, the US has to respond to these
*  attacks on ships, including US-owned ships and US military ships. But the US has to understand that
*  any retaliation risks playing directly into the complicated motivations you just described.
*  So how does the US try to navigate that? Right. So for the first few weeks of these attacks,
*  the US does really appear to be trying to avoid entering into this conflict directly.
*  There does seem to be some degree of recognition that there's a real risk of escalation if they
*  get involved and that the Houthis essentially could be legitimized by them attacking the Houthis.
*  It's finally recognizing the Houthis as worthy of attack. So there's some resistance in the
*  beginning toward that. There does seem to be a consensus at some point within the US establishment
*  that they do need to do something. And they eventually make this sort of statement with the
*  UK and with this coalition, essentially threatening that if the attacks don't stop, they're going to
*  respond. And that statement does seem to sort of lock them into action at that point, because the
*  Houthis have been very clear that they're not going to stop, that they absolutely have no intention
*  of stopping. And in fact, they've declared at this point that they would prefer a direct war with the
*  United States. So once the US does decide to retaliate, and it does so in a very forceful way,
*  hitting dozens of targets inside Yemen that are controlled by the Houthis, how does the US frame
*  it? The US is very careful to try to frame this as having nothing to do with Israel and the war in
*  Gaza. They're very concerned that essentially the Houthis are going to be able to weaponize this just
*  to sort of deepen their narrative even more. And so they try to sort of frame it as a coalition
*  response to protect economic interests, to protect global shipping, and really try to emphasize the
*  effect that the Houthi attacks have had on shipping and trade, particularly because they're passing
*  through this incredibly important part of the Red Sea that leads to the Suez Canal.
*  So when the US responds, what President Biden is saying is, I'm not going to give you the propaganda
*  tool of saying that this conflict is about what you, the Houthis, say it's about, which is Israel
*  and Hamas and Gaza. We are going to kind of strip all of this of that language and that symbolism.
*  Yes, that is what they say. That doesn't go over very well in the region or in Yemen. I mean,
*  we pretty immediately were speaking to Yemenis who were saying, even in territories that are
*  hostile to the Houthis, we're saying that, oh, it looks like the US just wants to attack them
*  because they're defending the Palestinians. So immediately that US effort to kind of parse
*  this and frame it is seen as futile throughout Yemen. Yeah, it definitely falls flat in Yemen
*  and in the broader Middle East. And there is honestly such a high level of anti-Americanism
*  across the region right now that it's very easy for the Houthis to spread this narrative and to
*  gain popularity over it. Regardless of how these attacks are being discussed or framed,
*  do the US coalition airstrikes work at all? Are they doing what the United States wants them to
*  do, which is to weaken the Houthis' capacity to strike ships in the Red Sea or in any way
*  deter the Houthis from continuing to wage these attacks?
*  They certainly do not deter the Houthis who pretty immediately have started to stage attacks again
*  and have vowed that they're going to be staging even bigger attacks. And they've said now that
*  they see not only targets tied to Israel as legitimate targets, but any targets tied to
*  American or British interests as legitimate targets for them to hit. So essentially they
*  are now widening the war. They're saying that this is a world war that we are excited to
*  enter into now and we're ready for it. Excited to enter. That's how they're framing this.
*  Yeah, they are really honestly with pretty open delight. I mean, there was a post today on social
*  media from one of their politicians basically saying, and I'll quote him, we're not worried
*  about this battle, nor do we care about it. The missiles and planes that we were bombed with during
*  the past nine years are the same ones that America has today. America was conducting this war against
*  us undercover and today we will confront it directly. It's a positive thing because America
*  is what brought destruction, siege and poverty to our country. So instead of doing anything to
*  contain the Houthis' aggression, the U.S. response, as perhaps many feared, risks if not
*  already is expanding the threat of the Houthis and any future attacks from the U.S., which the U.S.
*  claims it will undertake, is going to do the same. It's going to make things worse.
*  Right. There does seem to be a real risk of further escalation at this moment. It's not
*  clear how this is going to quiet down. Well, what are the options for the U.S. if
*  armed conflict and retaliation is proving to be so ineffective? What is basically the way out of a
*  dynamic in which responses from the U.S. and its allies are feeding the Houthi narrative and making
*  the Houthis more popular at home and less likely to ever want to stop doing this? The U.S. definitely
*  doesn't have a great option or menu of responses in terms of how it's going to address the Houthi
*  threat. However, one argument that we're hearing pretty consistently from regional American allies
*  like Qatar and Oman, which is a neighbor of Yemen and knows Yemen very well, has been that the only
*  way to address the threat posed by the Houthis is to resolve the underlying conflict that is
*  inflaming tensions across the region. And that, they say, is the war in Gaza. And their argument
*  essentially is that it is the war in Gaza that is spreading all of these tensions, that is causing
*  all of these different forms of escalation, and that is giving the Houthis a pretext for their
*  attacks. And if you can resolve that underlying conflict, if you can reach a ceasefire and you can
*  defuse that, then you will ultimately defuse all of the other problems that are going on in the region
*  right now. My guess is that the U.S. rejects that logic because it might feel to them like a reward
*  for what the Houthis are up to. You know, we're going to call for a ceasefire, we're going to push
*  for an end to Israel's battle against Hamas just to stop the Houthis from attacking ships in the Red Sea.
*  Right. I mean, there's certainly a fear now in the region and beyond that the Houthis know that they
*  have this power and that they're not going to simply stop using it, right? They know now that
*  they can essentially, you know, hold global trade hostage by attacking ships in the Red Sea. And it's
*  difficult to imagine them never using that card again if they know that they can play it.
*  Right. And how should we think about that, Vivian? I mean, the reality that in a very short time,
*  the Houthis go from the clan that they were to essentially the governing power in Yemen,
*  to now a force that is not just willing but able to menace all of Western commerce in the Red Sea.
*  I mean, it's really a remarkable rise. I mean, the Houthis were such an underdog. And I don't
*  think any of us imagined that we would be in this position when somebody sitting in New York even
*  knows who they are, right? They have just risen so quickly and they've defeated so many enemies that
*  were so much more powerful than them, that they essentially see themselves as finally, you know,
*  in the divine right path now. They see God is on their side, you know, they have no fear,
*  partly because of that. I mean, the Houthis have been very upfront that they are absolutely not
*  afraid of getting dragged into a long and extended war with the United States. And they've
*  explicitly brought up, you know, the precedents of Afghanistan and Vietnam and threatened that,
*  you know, come on, come and enter Yemen, invade Yemen, we're ready for you. And you have no idea
*  what is in for you, essentially. They're this guerrilla fighting force that has managed to
*  withstand much more powerful entities for years and years. And that has put them in this position
*  where they really feel that they have nothing to lose.
*  Well, Vivian, thank you very much. We appreciate it.
*  Thank you.
*  On Wednesday, the United States said that it would designate the Houthis as a terrorist organization
*  in its latest and so far fruitless attempt to pressure the group into ending its attacks in
*  the Red Sea. The Biden administration had removed the Houthis from the US terrorist in 2021,
*  saying the decision would make it easier for humanitarian aid to reach the people of Yemen.
*  The latest designation would, among other things, block the Houthis' access to the
*  global financial system and further isolate the group from Western institutions.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. On Wednesday, the judge overseeing the trial in which
*  the writer E. Jean Carroll has accused Donald Trump of defaming her warned Trump that he could be
*  thrown out of the court if he continues making comments that the jury can hear. The warning
*  came after a lawyer for Carroll complained that Trump had been overheard calling the trial a,
*  which hunt and a con job. And the next two Republican presidential debates scheduled for
*  Thursday and Sunday night in New Hampshire have been canceled because just one qualified candidate,
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, has agreed to appear. Trump has refused to participate in
*  any primary debates. And a few days ago, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley said that she
*  would refuse to attend unless Trump did, leaving DeSantis as the only candidate willing to debate.
