# The Secret Succession Fight That Will Determine the Future of Fox News
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHDDKt1TbOc)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  For years, Rupert Murdoch seemed content to let his children battle it out for control
*  of his conservative media empire once he's gone.
*  But as my colleague Jim Rutenberg found out, Murdoch's feelings have now changed.
*  Today, how Murdoch's secret choice touched off an ugly family squabble that could influence
*  how much of the world sees the news.
*  It's Friday, August 2nd.
*  So you have become, Jim, one of the world's leading experts on the Murdoch family, certainly
*  the expert for the New York Times on the Murdoch family.
*  This is of course the family that owns Fox News.
*  You've recently uncovered quite an unexpected turn in the tale of this family.
*  Tell us what you found.
*  Well, I have to say that yes, I've been covering this family for a long time.
*  I thought I'd seen it all, and apparently I hadn't.
*  The Murdochs have tried to keep a lot of this out of public view, but my reporting partner
*  Jonathan Mahler and I got access to a single sealed court document.
*  What we learned is that for many months in an obscure probate courthouse in Nevada, the
*  Murdoch family has been battling it out for control, not only of their family fortune,
*  but for Rupert Murdoch's huge global media empire, this conservative media juggernaut
*  that's best known for its crown jewel, Fox News.
*  It's classic.
*  On the one side, you have the patriarch Rupert and his favorite son, Lachlan.
*  On the other side is Rupert's remaining three adult children, James, Elizabeth, and Prudence.
*  Whichever faction ends up winning is going to have control over what we all know to be
*  this huge media empire that has incredible influence on our politics.
*  Jim, this sounds familiar.
*  Sounds like one of my favorite shows, the HBO series, Succession.
*  Well, it does.
*  And maybe that's because the family at the heart of that show is clearly based in part,
*  at least, on the Murdochs.
*  But while Succession may be a compelling cable drama, we all love it, this family fight is
*  very much real.
*  And unlike the show, this has real world consequences.
*  Okay, so before we get into this current fight, I think it's worth going back to the last
*  time you were on the show to talk about the Murdochs.
*  It was a few years ago.
*  Remind us where we left off at that point.
*  Well, interestingly, we left off right where this action picks up quite literally.
*  Rupert's two sons, Lachlan and James.
*  For their entire lives, almost, they had been fighting it out to succeed their father.
*  And for a long time, James Murdoch was the ascendant son.
*  James is younger than Lachlan, he's the younger brother, a technocrat, and increasingly as
*  he grew older, a political moderate.
*  At the same time, Murdoch's favorite son, Lachlan, his eldest, was really Rupert's
*  heart's desire.
*  Rupert had wanted Lachlan to run the business when he died, but Lachlan and Rupert had
*  had a fight earlier, so Lachlan had gone off to Australia to do his own thing.
*  James was ascendant.
*  Then comes the hacking scandal.
*  This morning, James Murdoch told a public hearing he did not know his reporters were
*  hacking cell phones.
*  I was given the same assurances as they gave outside.
*  I've been very consistent about it.
*  In the summer of 2011, several of Rupert Murdoch's newspapers are found to have been
*  hacking celebrities and the royals and sports stars, even a 13-year-old girl who had gone
*  missing.
*  News of the world executives and legal advisors warned in detail of what was happening, yet
*  Mr Murdoch said he had never been made aware and he didn't ask.
*  It's a cataclysmic existential crisis for the company, the biggest crisis in the Murdoch
*  Empire's history.
*  The media mogul Rupert Murdoch has arrived in London to help sort out the mess.
*  To some observers, it's his son James Murdoch who's left with egg on his face.
*  And James is the one in charge and takes the fall.
*  And Lachlan returns to the fold to help his brother cope with the scandal around hacking.
*  And Rupert tasks the two sons now to lead the business together.
*  And you have some tension here.
*  The tension in part is Fox News in the Trump era.
*  The America that we know and love doesn't exist anymore.
*  Massive demographic changes have been foisted upon the American people.
*  As Trump rises, Fox really starts moving more and more to the right.
*  This is a flat out invasion.
*  It had always been conservative, of course, from its very first days.
*  But as Trump rises and as Trump becomes the nominee for the Republican Party and certainly
*  after he wins and moves into the administration, the network begins to parrot some of his more
*  outrageous claims.
*  It's really beyond what we had seen from Fox in all of its history.
*  The point of mandatory vaccination is to identify the sincere Christians in the ranks, the free
*  thinkers, the men with high testosterone levels, and anyone else who does not love Joe Biden
*  and make them leave immediately.
*  It's a takeover of the U.S. military.
*  In futility, James, who's watching all this in despair, tries to rein it in.
*  He wants to kind of ground the network more, make it less wild.
*  But at the end of the day, the ratings are off the charts.
*  It's like record after record.
*  Rupert and Loughlin are thrilled.
*  And after basically losing this fight, James is the one out in the cold.
*  He's pretty much iced out.
*  James leaves and Loughlin emerges as Rupert's true successor.
*  But there's a catch.
*  Loughlin's control is temporary.
*  Because really what's going on here is that Rupert Murdoch has set up a family trust in
*  which all the family ownership of this global empire rests.
*  It's all in this trust.
*  So is it basically like a will?
*  It's better than a will.
*  And sorry, you neither you nor I will have one of these.
*  It's about not only Rupert's billion dollar fortune, which under the terms of the trust
*  will be split between all of his children equally, but so too will control of the global
*  empire after Rupert Murdoch dies.
*  Huge power.
*  Huge power, but shared, shared power.
*  So Loughlin's a successor as long as Rupert's alive.
*  But once Rupert dies, Loughlin's place in the succession is now up for grabs.
*  All four children will have an equal claim to succession and equal shares in voting power
*  as to who it will be who will lead them.
*  As Rupert Murdoch told Charlie Rose way back in 2006.
*  While you have said you could see you would like to have a member of the family succeed
*  you.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  Either sons or daughters, you'd like to have it.
*  It will be up to them to decide who will lead them.
*  If I go under a bus tomorrow, it'll be the four of them will have to decide which of
*  the ones should lead them.
*  Your four children.
*  They'll all be treated equally.
*  They'll all be treated equally.
*  And here's the thing.
*  That trust is irrevocable.
*  That is legally set in stone cannot be changed.
*  Okay, so the plot thickens and this is a potentially really messy can of worms opening up in the
*  event that Rupert Murdoch dies.
*  Nothing ever stays settled in this family just like succession and the three children
*  James Elizabeth and Prudence started to form their own block.
*  In fact, the three were basically upset at the turn of events where Lachlan is the successor
*  and so they actually went to their father and brother and said, okay, Lachlan can buy
*  the three of us out.
*  Take the trust.
*  Take the companies.
*  We'll have more billions of dollars to play with.
*  Sayonara.
*  Got it.
*  So just take the money and run.
*  We're done with this.
*  Yeah, which makes a lot of sense.
*  Makes sense to me.
*  I'll take a few billion dollars.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Me too.
*  But it doesn't happen.
*  And it doesn't happen, we're told at the time, because you just couldn't come up with that
*  kind of money.
*  I mean, this would be like several billion dollars.
*  But in the end, the trust stays the same and all the siblings will still have an equal say
*  in it after Rupert's passing.
*  But there's a vestige of this that becomes very important.
*  Because now you have the three siblings, James, Prudence and Elizabeth, they're still in that
*  trust acting as a separate block.
*  And over the intervening years, there's increasingly talk that this block could do something here.
*  That when Rupert dies, this block could move to shove Lachlan aside and take over the company.
*  So instead of running away from the company selling and getting out, they're actually
*  going in the opposite direction, running toward the company, the power it potentially presents
*  and kind of wresting control away from Lachlan, the favored by Rupert older brother.
*  Theoretically, the thinking here would be if we're in it, then we're in it.
*  But we don't want to own it in this form.
*  And again, this is talk around them.
*  There's a lot of speculation, but there's a lot of coverage of this in the press.
*  And Rupert is a consumer of this coverage that they would do this, take the company
*  from their brother and change it after Rupert's death.
*  So Jim, what would that look like?
*  I mean, if they took over the company, obviously, we don't have a crystal ball here, but like,
*  theoretically, how are they different?
*  And what would Fox look like if they did take it over?
*  We have some history here to go on, and it's all we have to go on.
*  The view we understand the best is that of James.
*  OK.
*  And as we understood it, James and his sisters apparently are in the same camp.
*  It was never talking about making Fox into MSNBC, certainly, not even CNN.
*  I mean, he understood and I think they all understand that this is a right leaning
*  conservative empire.
*  But the language around James and when his view was explained to us, it would come
*  through as words like responsibility and ethics and journalism, being grounded in
*  journalism. And so you're looking at what would be a Fox that maybe wouldn't talk about
*  an immigrant invasion.
*  You wouldn't hear doubts about climate change and the human causes.
*  You'd have way less conspiratorial thinking in the opinion sections of Fox, which over
*  the years, especially in the Trump era, really went into places where Fox had never even
*  gone. So you'd see a more moderate, a more
*  cautious Fox, still a conservative Fox, but more the Wall Street Journal editorial page
*  and less info wars.
*  By the way, I just want to note the children themselves are not saying this openly, but
*  everyone in Murdoch's world talks about this all the time.
*  What if this happens?
*  It's just everywhere. You have to be like under a rock to miss this story.
*  And Rupert's certainly not under a rock when it comes to his own family.
*  That's been my question.
*  As all of the swirl, the talk in that Murdoch world that these three would take over the
*  company and vote out their brother, I always wondered as someone who's been covering this
*  man for decades, is he just going to sit there?
*  And when that proverbial bus rolls him over, as he put it to Charlie Rose, is he just going
*  to be OK that these four children are going to fight it out amongst themselves and maybe
*  his chosen one loses?
*  I just wondered, is he really going to let that happen?
*  And two weeks ago, I got my answer and the answer was a decided no.
*  He was going to fight back.
*  We'll be right back.
*  OK, so Rupert Murdoch decides to make a move.
*  What does he do?
*  Well, I can't get inside his head, but it's pretty clear that this talk of his three children
*  ganging up on his one, the chosen one, and moving him aside and perhaps reorienting the
*  company away from Rupert's vision.
*  I mean, this is not good.
*  But remember, this trust is irrevocable.
*  So what can he do?
*  Well, when you're a billionaire, what you can do is hire really good lawyers.
*  And his lawyers start, from what we can tell, going through this thing and they find a loophole.
*  OK, so what's the loophole?
*  Well, so again, the trust is presumably irrevocable, but it does contain this narrow provision
*  that would allow Rupert to make changes to its structure as long as they're done in good
*  faith and with a singular sole purpose, and that is to benefit its members.
*  So how does he want to change the trust?
*  Like what are we talking about here?
*  Well, if you remember, you have these four equal shares.
*  Well, what Rupert decides he wants to do is basically disenfranchise the three, James,
*  Prudence and Elizabeth so that Lachlan has sole control.
*  But that seems to fly in the face of how the trust is structured, right?
*  Like the changes have to benefit all four equally.
*  Here this seems to be clearly favoring just one of the kids, Lachlan.
*  It's interesting that you would say that because in Rupert's view, we understand that this
*  internally was being described as Project Harmony.
*  Oh, OK.
*  And it was Project Harmony because, OK, you could argue that it's Lachlan being raised
*  above all others.
*  But the argument, apparently in Rupert's world and Lachlan's world is no, no, no, this is
*  for everybody's good.
*  It's Harmony.
*  Lachlan's the guy.
*  No fighting amongst yourselves.
*  We're going to clean that thing up.
*  Everyone could be happy and line up behind Lachlan.
*  Well, when Rupert goes to formalize this, he actually does go in person to London to
*  visit with, as we understand it, Elizabeth and Prue to inform them of Project Harmony.
*  It is not harmonious.
*  As we reported, Elizabeth responded to this possibility with a string of expletives.
*  So where there are expletives, if you have money, there are lawyers.
*  And so now where there were rumors of a three child block against Lachlan, now there really
*  is one.
*  The three are now formally pushed together into a block.
*  They hire a lawyer between them and they push this thing into a court battle in Nevada where
*  it will now fall to a judge to decide the key issue.
*  Can Rupert do this?
*  OK, so what's Rupert Murdoch's argument here?
*  I mean, I'm curious how he's actually presenting this to the court.
*  It seems like it would be on his face an uphill battle.
*  Well, there are a couple arguments he's making.
*  One is that allegiances are constantly changing.
*  Who's friends with who and the family is always shifting.
*  So you can't have that.
*  That this is bad for business.
*  We need Harmony.
*  We need one person and one person only.
*  And that person is Lachlan.
*  And in the court record that we've obtained, this is made very clear where in laying some
*  of this out, what the Rupert side said was that Rupert as the founder knows these companies
*  better than anyone and believes that Lachlan is in the best position to carry on the successful
*  strategy to be the leader of these companies.
*  Now what's the strategy?
*  We know the strategy.
*  that so many of these Murdoch outlets are these right wing sort of clarions.
*  And so there's a concern that the three would outvote the one and change the editorial orientation
*  of the companies, which again would jeopardize the value of the companies.
*  So what does that boil down to?
*  Dad's doing this for you guys.
*  I'm taking away your power, but you can thank me later.
*  That's basically the argument.
*  And what's the evidence that that's actually true?
*  I mean, that it would jeopardize the value of the companies?
*  Well, it's a great question.
*  And just to preface my answer, I just want to make clear, we don't know how much that
*  is going to be litigated in this court case, but it's a very important and interesting
*  question.
*  And what Rupert Murdoch could point to and Lachlan Murdoch can point to is 2020.
*  Election night has happened and Fox declares that Joe Biden has won the key state of Arizona,
*  which really hurts Trump's ability to claim he's the true winner.
*  And Trump is furious.
*  His base voters are furious and therefore the Fox audience is furious.
*  And that audience for a time flees the network.
*  There's a cratering of ratings.
*  Okay.
*  It's a crisis.
*  And so Fox scrambles to get them back.
*  It starts trafficking its opinion hosts, especially start trafficking in some of the stolen voter
*  conspiracy and having guests on who are talking about it and letting Trump make these arguments
*  that the election was stolen.
*  Now they do that and they get their audience back, but they wouldn't have been able to
*  presumably in this different direction, scramble to the Trump base and give them what they
*  wanted, which is always the Rupert rule.
*  Give them what they want.
*  Okay.
*  So there is something to Rupert's argument, right?
*  I mean, there is value here in going in the direction that he says Fox should be going
*  in.
*  You know, if it leaves this spot where it is on the political spectrum, its viewership
*  could suffer.
*  Well, yeah.
*  And especially now, I want to say, because the viewers who fled Fox had somewhere else
*  to go.
*  They could go to Newsmax, which is a new right wing rival to Fox.
*  There was One America News that flanked it out to its right, was plenty happy trafficking
*  in that kind of conspiracy.
*  There are websites, there are podcasts.
*  The Fox News audience has never had more places to go to on its right.
*  So there is a real competitive issue there.
*  So what did James and his sisters say to that?
*  Well, again, we don't know the particulars because this whole case is sealed.
*  So there's so much that's happening here in secret and our access is fairly limited.
*  But we do know what James has said in the past.
*  And what James's argument was back when he was running the company with his brother was,
*  sure, you're going to get the short term rating gains, no doubt.
*  I don't think he ever argued with that.
*  But at what cost?
*  And let's remember what happened after the 2020 election.
*  Yes, Fox regained its ratings footing, flanked out its right wing competitors.
*  But boy, did it come at a cost.
*  As you might remember, there was a voting company called Dominion Voting Systems that
*  was in the center of some of those voting conspiracies.
*  Those voting conspiracies popped out onto Fox's air.
*  They were about this supposed voting machine company switching Trump votes to Biden's votes.
*  The company files a defamation suit.
*  And in the end, Rupert Murdoch is forced to shell out the biggest defamation settlement
*  in known history of almost $800 million.
*  They're facing another lawsuit.
*  Yeah, it's a lot of money.
*  I mean, it was a huge financial hit for the company and kind of showed how going too far
*  out there in the conspiracy world could cost real world money, right?
*  Yeah. And by the way, it didn't end with Dominion.
*  There's another suit still pending by another voting company, part of the same conspiracy
*  called Smartmatic.
*  It's suing Fox for almost $2.6 billion.
*  These are gigantic sums for any corporation in America, let's face it.
*  But I want to say one thing.
*  From the court papers we've obtained, James and his sisters are making a more narrow argument
*  that boils down to, dad, you can't do this.
*  This is favoring one over the other.
*  And the trust as written very clearly said they all had to be treated equally.
*  And this is certainly not equal.
*  Okay.
*  So now all of this is in the hands of a court in Nevada.
*  Yeah.
*  Basically, as we understand it, in September, all the drama will play out behind these closed
*  doors and it will fall to this probate commissioner in Washoe County, Nevada to decide where this
*  all ends up.
*  So Jim, just taking a step back for a second, you know, we've been talking to you literally
*  for years about this family.
*  And it just seems like it goes around and around the succession battle.
*  It's settled, then it's not.
*  It comes back again.
*  Alliances shift.
*  But this time, you know, in that court, it really does feel like maybe this is it.
*  We're going to get the answer.
*  The series finale.
*  Well, in the real life version of the story, there are never season finale.
*  It's possible.
*  This judge could say, hey, Rupert gets his say here.
*  It's Loughlin.
*  And then Fox News stays Fox News.
*  The empire stays intact.
*  Everything goes in its way.
*  Or he says Rupert can't do this.
*  And then you think you have an answer.
*  Okay, now you have a solid block of the other three.
*  They will wrest this away from Loughlin.
*  They will change Fox News, change the empire.
*  But that just might not be the case.
*  Because all these children over the course of all these decades I've been covering this
*  family, their alliances are constantly shifting.
*  James and Elizabeth aren't talking.
*  James and Loughlin aren't talking.
*  James and Rupert aren't talking.
*  So we don't even know that after Rupert dies, these three are going to stay in a block.
*  So think about it this way.
*  The fate of the most influential conservative media empire in the entire English-speaking
*  world and by extension, the politics of the English-speaking world and beyond all rest
*  on these few siblings finding a way to finally get along.
*  And good luck with that.
*  God bless.
*  Jim, thank you.
*  Thank you so much.
*  We'll be right back.
*  President Biden announced that an elaborate prisoner swap involving seven different countries
*  had freed three Americans and one American green card holder who'd been held in Russia.
*  Among those released were Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter, Alsu Kurmashcheva,
*  a reporter at Radio Free Europe, Vladimir Karamurza, a columnist at The Washington Post,
*  and Paul Whelan, a corporate security executive and former Marine.
*  All four have been imprisoned unjustly in Russia.
*  Paul for nearly six years.
*  Vladimir since 2022.
*  Evan since March of 2023.
*  And Alsu since October of 2023.
*  It was the largest and most complex East-West prisoner swap since the Cold War and involved
*  months of delicate negotiations between the U.S., Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway, Turkey,
*  and Russia.
*  And now their brutal ordeal is over and they're free.
*  For Russia, the swap meant the release of a prized figure, Vadim Krasikov, a Russian
*  hitman convicted of murdering a Chechen fighter in Germany on orders from the Kremlin.
*  On Thursday night, Gershkovich, Whelan, and Kurmashcheva landed at Andrews Air Force Base
*  in Maryland, where they were met by their families, President Biden and Vice President
*  Kamala Harris.
*  And on Thursday night, the United States weighed into Venezuela's disputed presidential election,
*  with Secretary of State Antony Blinken recognizing the opposition candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez,
*  as the winner.
*  Blinken said in a statement that the evidence was, quote, overwhelming, setting up a clash
*  with the country's authoritarian president, Nicolas Maduro, who himself had claimed victory
*  in this weekend's election.
*  A quick reminder to catch a new episode of The Interview right here tomorrow.
*  This week, David Marchese speaks with actor Vince Vaughn about R-rated comedies, Timidity
*  in Hollywood, and just how much fatherhood changed him.
*  I don't know that I've changed as far as like, oh, I was cold and callous and now I've learned
*  to love.
*  I think it's just made me more empathetic, more patient, just because the nature of the
*  job.
