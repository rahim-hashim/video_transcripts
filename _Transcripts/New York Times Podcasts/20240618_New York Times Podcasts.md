# A Novel Legal Strategy for Mass Shooting Victims’ Families
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Izt8l2jwlXQ)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams, in for Michael.
*  And this is The Daily.
*  As mass shootings continue to plague the United States, the families of victims continue to
*  search for accountability.
*  Now, a pair of lawsuits by the families of victims of the Uvalde school shooting are
*  trying a new tactic.
*  The suits target a popular video game, a gun manufacturer, and Instagram, accusing them
*  of helping to groom and equip the teenage gunman who committed the massacre.
*  Today, my colleague David Goodman, on the lawsuits and the lawyer behind them.
*  It's Tuesday, June 18th.
*  So David, after a shooting, people are always looking around for who to blame.
*  They ask questions about how did this person get a gun?
*  Could anything have been done to prevent this?
*  Should anything have been done to prevent this?
*  And now we've got these two new lawsuits that are filed by the families of victims in the
*  Uvalde shooting, and they're pointing the finger in a pretty interesting direction.
*  So tell me about those.
*  You know, after all of these shootings, what we have is people from the right and from
*  the left sort of going to their different camps.
*  On the Democratic side, there are calls for greater gun control, background checks, other
*  types of policies that could be put into place to limit the access to guns.
*  And on the Republican side, it's who is this person and what kind of mental health challenges
*  are particular to this person.
*  And we've gone through the cycle so many times that it's really become just almost like an
*  American tradition for us now.
*  But, you know, recently there have been actually some efforts to try and sort of broaden the
*  scope of who might be legally accountable for these shootings.
*  We want to get you now to Uvalde, Texas.
*  Families of victims of the Robb Elementary school shooting are making an announcement.
*  You can say a lot of things about the law enforcement response in this case, but one
*  thing you can't say is that they caused this shooting.
*  Families of Uvalde shooting victims filed lawsuits against companies they say bear responsibility
*  for products used by the gunmen.
*  What's happening here is we have these two new lawsuits filed by the families of most
*  of the victims of the Uvalde massacre.
*  Lawsuits have now been filed against three companies, Meta Platforms, which owns Instagram.
*  The video game company Activision, which makes the popular game Call of Duty, and Daniel
*  Defense, which made the AR-15 style rifle used in the massacre.
*  That accused video game company and one of the biggest social media platforms and a gun
*  manufacturer of essentially grooming the gunmen.
*  These are really some of the most far reaching to be filed yet in response to these escalating
*  number of mass shootings in the U.S.
*  And they're really the brainchild of this one lawyer.
*  Hello.
*  Hey guys, can you hear me?
*  Yeah.
*  How are you?
*  Good, good.
*  Hi David.
*  How are you?
*  And tell me about this lawyer.
*  Well, his name is Josh Koskoff.
*  He's 57 years old.
*  He's based in Connecticut.
*  And for most of his career practicing law, he's been a medical malpractice attorney, a
*  personal injury attorney.
*  The way I got into the gun litigation was really by total accident and happenstance.
*  And he really had no experience trying gun cases at all.
*  So how does he actually go from making the leap to representing some of the families
*  here?
*  Well, the way he makes this transition starts well before Ivaldi, basically 10 years earlier.
*  Well, I'm about 20 miles from Sandy Hook.
*  It starts with the school shooting at Sandy Hook.
*  And he essentially gets involved by accident.
*  Tell me how you got approached about the Sandy Hook case.
*  I was getting a ride to the airport and the driver asked me what I did for a living.
*  And I told him that I was a lawyer.
*  And he said, oh, really?
*  Boy, do I have a friend who really needs a lawyer?
*  He said that his friend had just lost a child at Sandy Hook.
*  He had a conversation with a cab driver who ended up connecting him with one of the Sandy
*  Hook families.
*  At the time, I wasn't really thinking about a lawsuit.
*  I was simply thinking about, could I help these people get through probate?
*  Could I help them manage the press, which was all...
*  He's been a medical malpractice attorney.
*  He can help in terms of the basic law after someone's lost someone.
*  But I started to get to know these families and I started to see tremendous shattering
*  loss, which left them sort of looking for answers.
*  And as he's trying to figure out the strategy, he comes across photos of the crime scene
*  that the police have released.
*  And I saw a photograph of the weapon on the floor of this classroom.
*  And I just asked the question, how did it get here?
*  And so that sort of began a long odyssey of trying to...
*  So he starts to think about the kinds of liability that might exist here.
*  And as he starts looking into this...
*  I knew nothing about guns as a product.
*  And I knew even less about gun litigation.
*  I didn't know anything about the law of guns.
*  I just assumed you could sue a gun company for being negligent.
*  I thought you could sue them for selling a product that was unreasonably dangerous.
*  His assumption is that like any legal action, you can hold a company liable for the way
*  that their product is used or misused.
*  Only to learn that actually this industry is uniquely protected by the federal government.
*  And so he ends up discovering that there's this 2005 law, the Protection of Lawful Commerce
*  in Arms Act, often referred to as PLACA.
*  And I read one case and I thought, what is this?
*  LCAA.
*  And I looked it up and I read the statute and I genuinely thought it was not constitutional.
*  So what this law does is really give arms makers, gun manufacturers, a broad set of
*  protections against being sued for the way their weapons are used to cause harm.
*  You know, the sort of harm that occurs all the time in this country.
*  Most lawyers come to the conclusion that this all but slams the door shut on the courts
*  when it comes to bringing illegal cases against gun makers for these mass shootings.
*  And worst of all, the gun industry was perceiving it as an absolute immunity.
*  And the perception of being immune from civil liability and having to pay damages for harms
*  or deaths that are created when you sell guns is a very dangerous perception.
*  Okay.
*  So Koskof is considering suing the company that made this gun that was used in Sandy
*  Hook and he runs up against this wall of protection that's unique to the gun industry, PLACA,
*  which does this make him think twice?
*  Well, not exactly.
*  You know, he didn't really even know enough to have that attitude.
*  He sort of felt like this was the right thing to do and he was going to keep going with it.
*  So what he ends up doing with this case is taking advantage of an exception to the federal law.
*  So the law is the protection of lawful commerce in Arms Act.
*  What he correctly notices is that it does not protect unlawful commerce.
*  And so what he tries to do is prove that the company in the Sandy Hook shooting, Remington,
*  has done illegal marketing, you know, has essentially violated a Connecticut consumer law.
*  Okay, so basically he's arguing, hey, Remington broke this other law so they should not be
*  protected by PLACA.
*  Right.
*  And does that work?
*  It does.
*  And so, you know, one of the things that he points to is that these advertisements that
*  were aimed at regular people that played up the guns' military connections and their combat
*  readiness and he basically argues that this was an unlawful promotion because in the military
*  guns are used to wage war and kill people.
*  I mean, there's a lot of legal back and forth, but, you know, eventually the suit survives
*  the company's attempts to get it thrown out, which in and of itself is really a remarkable
*  feat.
*  And so then they go into this phase where the company has to turn over documents as
*  part of the lawsuit.
*  It's as if they were selling widgets, but they're talking about AR-15.
*  So what they're trying to do in this time period of the Sandy Hook shooting was they're
*  trying to reach and expand the AR-15 market to target youth as potential future customers.
*  They call the target an end user.
*  So what he's able to see in these documents that are turned over are, you know, internal
*  company discussions about marketing weapons.
*  And he sees that this company is trying very hard to reach a younger audience.
*  We see in the documentation questions like what kind of problems do they have?
*  Is it a man, a woman or a kid?
*  Who are we trying to reach?
*  And why does he think they need to reach this younger audience?
*  Because they need to win that audience to sell their products.
*  You know, this is like any other item in a market that's very competitive.
*  In order to get new customers, you need to go get them when they're young.
*  You need to develop a brand loyalty early on.
*  We saw this effort reflected in the documentation that we were able to obtain.
*  There were very intentional efforts to reach these kids through Call of Duty.
*  In fact, the records show that Remington, the gun manufacturer, had actually made a
*  deal with Activision, the makers of Call of Duty, to get one of their products featured
*  in the game.
*  And it was widely reported that the Sandy Hook shooter was an avid player of Call of
*  Duty.
*  Oh, wow, interesting.
*  So how did they actually make use of that information in court?
*  At this point, all that information is really locked up in the lawsuit.
*  It won't be made public until the trial.
*  But before that ever happens, the company Remington is in financial trouble and is essentially
*  bankrupt and its insurers are the ones negotiating with the lawyers at this point.
*  And they agree to a settlement to end this lawsuit.
*  So does that mean they won?
*  Well, it's a win for the families.
*  They got $73 million.
*  In a free market where corporate conduct is often motivated by greed and people lose their
*  moral compass, the only way to correct that conduct and to protect the public is by hitting
*  them in the pocketbook.
*  I mean, this was the biggest settlement by a gun manufacturer for a mass shooting that
*  we've yet seen.
*  But you know, he didn't actually test these arguments at trial.
*  So there was never a final verdict on the arguments that he was putting forth.
*  After the settlement happens, he really felt like this was the end for him with these kinds
*  of cases.
*  I didn't know that I would be the quote, like, mass shooting lawyer, unquote.
*  It was something I never anticipated.
*  But then just a few months later, after they settle the Sandy Hook case, a gunman walks
*  to Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.
*  And Uvalde was like Sandy Hook 2.0 with even more outrageous facts.
*  And the shooting there is really eerily similar in its details.
*  And I just felt when I was contacted by these families that I can't turn my back on this.
*  Like, I knew it was my obligation to do it.
*  So Koskoff gets involved in Uvalde.
*  It had been pretty much widely reported early on that he acquired the Daniel Defense AR-15
*  effectively from the day he turned 18.
*  And as he starts to dig into the case, what stands out to him is the timing.
*  So that told me that this company had been targeting this kid for years.
*  And he's pretty convinced he can draw a direct line between the marketing scheme and the
*  shooter and really expand on the strategy that he'd pioneered with Sandy Hook.
*  What makes him say that?
*  How is he so sure?
*  Well, part of the reason he feels this way is that he says he has access to information
*  that's actually coming from the shooter's phone.
*  Now, to be clear, this is something that I haven't actually seen myself.
*  But Koskoff, in writing his complaint, what he does with that is construct this really
*  timeline that he says explains the crux of the matter here.
*  How did an impoverished teenager from a small town in rural Texas become so enamored with
*  this pretty expensive rifle that he would be so primed to purchase it that he would
*  do so really minutes after he was legally able to.
*  So what does Koskoff actually learn from looking at the shooter's phone and what timeline is
*  he able to construct from that?
*  Okay, well, according to the complaint, in November of 2021, which is several months
*  before the shooting, the shooter here downloads Call of Duty Modern Warfare.
*  And he's downloaded the game before, a different version of the game.
*  But what's unique about this version of the game is that the title page, so the loading
*  screen that comes up when you first start playing the game, features a character, you
*  know, really sort of all decked out in body armor.
*  And they're carrying an AR-15 style rifle with this sort of special sight on it, a special
*  scope.
*  And this is a weapon made by Daniel Defense.
*  It's the DDM4 V7 model, which is exactly the rifle used by the shooter in Yuvaldi.
*  So he's exposed to this weapon at that point.
*  We don't know if it's the first time he's seen it, but certainly after that moment,
*  He begins to research on his phone this particular rifle, this very niche weapon.
*  Why this weapon?
*  All these weapons do the same thing.
*  They're all function exactly the same, and they all offer the same ability to kill.
*  And these guns are not the cheapest on the market.
*  There was something about this small company from Georgia that spoke to this kid.
*  And so you can see that shortly after downloading this game, he begins to research Daniel Defense
*  and research this particular weapon.
*  And the Daniel Defense website becomes one of these frequently visited sites on his browser
*  of this phone that Koskov says he has access to.
*  And the shooter begins saving money from his low wage job to buy this high end weapon.
*  And according to the complaint, about a month before the shooting at Robb Elementary, the
*  shooter creates an account on the Daniel Defense website.
*  He puts the Daniel Defense rifle in his cart, like many of us have done with other items.
*  And soon after, this is in April of 2022, while the shooter is still 17, he puts this
*  particular weapon, the DDM4V7, into his cart on the website.
*  And the complaint alleges what the company does at that point is send him an email.
*  And they do what every other company does in the online marketplace.
*  They say, hey, are you still interested in buying that Daniel Defense rifle because
*  we're still more than happy to sell it to you.
*  Now this is one of these kinds of alerts that says, hey, we saw you put something in your
*  cart, do you still want to buy it?
*  But he's not allowed to buy it at that moment because he's still 17.
*  All they have to do is buy their time to get what they really want from him, which is his
*  credit card.
*  He's so eager for that moment to come, he's apparently Googling how many days it will
*  be, he then goes on a kind of counter to figure it out.
*  And the day he turns 18, he's on that Daniel Defense website.
*  What happens when he is 18 years and 23 minutes old?
*  Just minutes after midnight.
*  And 23 minutes after turning 18, he gets confirmation that he has purchased it, this roughly $2,000
*  rifle.
*  It was clearly proof positive of a successful marketing campaign.
*  Remember, their goal is to sell this kid an AR-15 as soon as possible to beat out their
*  competition.
*  They have successfully hooked this kid with this engagement of a sale.
*  And eight days later, he walks in to Robb Elementary School with that rifle and opens
*  fire.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So David, just to recap, Koskoff is examining the sale of this gun to the Uvalde shooter.
*  And it seems like that email from the gunmaker is important.
*  But these are the kinds of emails that I get all the time when I'm buying something online,
*  like a coffee maker or pair of shoes or something.
*  Help me understand why it's important and significant here.
*  Well, for Koskoff, this push email is a pretty important piece of evidence that really allows
*  him to make the argument that Daniel Defense is offering to sell a weapon to a minor.
*  And that would be a violation of Texas law.
*  Right.
*  And if he can successfully argue that they violated state law, he can get around PLACA
*  and bring a lawsuit against the gun manufacturer for this mass shooting.
*  That's right.
*  But Daniel Defense isn't the only company being sued here.
*  So you had also mentioned the companies behind Call of Duty and Instagram.
*  So tell me how Koskoff thinks that those companies are involved.
*  Right.
*  So Koskoff has actually filed another lawsuit in California.
*  And that's the one that names Activision, the publisher of Call of Duty, and Meta, the
*  parent company for Instagram.
*  And that lawsuit is about holding those companies liable for essentially helping promote the
*  weapons that are used in mass shootings to vulnerable children.
*  I mean, Daniel Defense is, remember, a niche company.
*  They have less than 1% of the market share for these types of weapons.
*  And his argument is that they wouldn't have been able to reach this kid without the help
*  of these other companies.
*  And what he says is that it really took these three prongs, the gun manufacturer, the video
*  game company, and the social media company, to groom this Yuvalde shooter, to get him
*  primed to want this weapon.
*  And what is he basing that off of?
*  Is it just the appearance of the gun on the loading page of the game?
*  Well, in the case of Call of Duty, that is evidence of a connection that he sees between
*  the two companies.
*  That kind of thing doesn't happen just by accident.
*  OK.
*  So Koskoff's argument is that there's this three-prong marketing strategy.
*  And he's saying that the gun manufacturer needs these two companies to capture a younger
*  audience.
*  So let's talk more about his arguments around those two companies, starting with Activision,
*  the publisher of Call of Duty.
*  Koskoff says that he's trying to make the link between the Daniel Defense gun and Activision.
*  But beyond that, he's making a broader argument for how the game, Call of Duty, actually is
*  really a key part of this ecosystem, he would say, that can shape a person like this Yuvalde
*  shooter.
*  And what his argument is is that Call of Duty is the first-person shooter game.
*  It's incredibly popular.
*  It's really this extremely immersive experience.
*  And for Koskoff, this is important.
*  This is a very important point.
*  Video games have always had an addictive quality, but they have never had the 360-degree immersion
*  of a Call of Duty.
*  It uses the reward system of an addictive game and partly and very much is a training
*  simulation that is so realistic that it allows the user to experience the actual recoil of
*  the weapon, the chaos of killing, and to be habituated to it.
*  He argues it's more like a simulator and less like a game, that is really sort of giving
*  players the experience of killing.
*  It's a practice for eventually doing the thing.
*  And it is too facile to say video games don't cause violence when a lot of those studies
*  are based on generic video games of yesteryear.
*  So what Koskoff argues basically is that the studies out there don't really account for
*  this, that they're about video games in the past, that essentially these conversations
*  that we've had about violence in video games, these are outdated.
*  In some sense it's true that there haven't been robust studies on the impacts of newer
*  versions of Call of Duty, for example, or how it might influence behavior.
*  But this has been an area that's been studied for a while, including recently, and there
*  hasn't been this exact connection that he wants to say exists between increasing levels
*  of realism and violence.
*  It's also important to note that at the same time experts really do say that gun violence
*  is more tied to gun access than it is to violent video games.
*  That is a really striking argument though, the idea that a game could train you to use
*  a specific type of weapon.
*  I mean, aren't these two experiences, playing a video game and using a gun in real life,
*  really quite different?
*  Well, one of the things to know about the shooter in the Ivaldi massacre is that prior
*  to going to that elementary school and opening fire, by all reports that we have, he had
*  never fired a weapon before, but he had shot for many, many hours, countless hours, guns
*  within the world of Call of Duty.
*  And in fact, one of the things that Koskoff argues in the complaint, and he has information
*  from the phone and other internet activity to back this up, he claims, is that he was
*  very, very good and got lots of positive feedback from the game to indicate that he had really
*  excelled at it.
*  And Koskoff is quick to point out, and he does so in the complaint, that this shooter
*  and the one in Sandy Hook were not the only ones to play Call of Duty.
*  You also had the El Paso Walmart shooter, the one in Highland Park, Illinois.
*  They were also avid, apparently, players of this game, according to public reports.
*  But couldn't it just be that people who are more likely to commit mass shootings also
*  enjoy playing these types of violent games?
*  I mean, I feel like we've been having this debate forever about whether violent video
*  games increase actual real world violence.
*  Is the argument he's making that the game causes the behavior just like a little bit
*  of a stretch?
*  Yeah, I mean, I think if that was the only argument that he was making, it probably really
*  would be a stretch.
*  And we would be back in this, you know, decades-long debate over violence in video games and whether
*  you can connect the two.
*  But what he's really arguing here is, you know, not so much that the game caused this
*  action, but that it's an addictive platform that's part of this larger ecosystem that
*  allows the gun manufacturer to reach teenagers and that this whole ecosystem is essentially
*  facilitating violence.
*  So Koskof is saying, hey, Call of Duty is in a league of its own in terms of its addictiveness
*  and its ability to influence its users.
*  And he's also making this argument that the game is connecting these young, sometimes
*  troubled people like the shooter with this niche AR-15 style rifle and that therefore,
*  Call of Duty and its maker, Activision, are at least partially responsible for the Uvalde
*  shooting.
*  So what did they actually say in response to that accusation?
*  Well, you know, as to whether they have an actual formal marketing agreement with Daniel
*  Defense, they didn't comment on that.
*  And they didn't want to address the specifics of the lawsuit.
*  They did give me a more general response, acknowledging, you know, the pain and the
*  horror of the Uvalde shooting, but also saying, quote, academic and scientific research continues
*  to show that there is no causal link between video games and gun violence.
*  And as a company points out there, you know, it is a tiny fraction of people that play
*  video games that are violent and go on to commit real world violence.
*  And there are millions and millions of others who, you know, have been playing this game
*  for years all across the United States and haven't done anything like that.
*  And at the same time, there's been many other mass shooters that were not connected to the game.
*  Right.
*  And so we've talked about prongs one and two, which are the gun manufacturer and the video
*  game.
*  So tell me about the third prong, which in this case is Instagram.
*  Specifically, what is the legal logic behind blaming them?
*  You know, Koskof says that Instagram is key because of how easily gun content can reach
*  young people on the platform, that young people are able to sign up, even those who are younger
*  than they're technically allowed to get on the platform, and that this essentially allows
*  for kind of an unregulated or unmitigated connection between gun marketers, gun manufacturers
*  and teenage viewers of Instagram.
*  And even though the social media platform doesn't actually allow these sponsored ads,
*  you're not allowed as a gun manufacturer to advertise on the platform.
*  What you can do is have organic content.
*  They can have their own posts.
*  One of the things that Koskof is arguing here is that because these companies have felt
*  like they had a federal shield around them that protected them, they've kind of allowed
*  their marketing efforts to some of them anyway to get pretty extreme.
*  So the complaint calls attention to posts from Daniel Defense, including one where they
*  show off a weapon set up and describe it as, quote, totally murdered out.
*  And there's another one that shows a view through a rifle scope, looking down from a
*  rooftop, and it's in an urban setting, and there's a windshield of a parked car that's
*  in the crosshairs.
*  And the caption reads, rooftop ready even at midnight.
*  And targeting someone in a car with your weapon, it's almost by definition an aggressive use
*  of that weapon.
*  And it's something that they were marketing.
*  They were marketing this weapon as something that you might use in these situations.
*  And so these are posts that Koskof argues have gotten increasingly extreme because there's
*  essentially the belief that there's nothing reining them in, that the law protected them
*  and that at the same time, there was actually market share to be gained by selling this
*  violence.
*  OK, but do we know that the Uvalde shooter even saw some of the content on Instagram
*  that we're talking about?
*  No, we don't know that.
*  I mean, it's not clear, at least from what's in the complaint that he did.
*  What the complaint says, and this is from cell phone data that Koskof says he has,
*  is that the shooter was an avid user of Instagram, that he had at least 20 accounts.
*  And we know he was searching for the gun, at least according to Koskof's description
*  of what was on his phone, and that he was on the Daniel Defense website.
*  But it's still an open question as to whether he would have been shown this Daniel Defense
*  content because of his activities on that website.
*  Right, this seems like a hard argument that Instagram should be held liable for something
*  that Daniel Defense or influencers or whoever were posting.
*  Right, it is a big challenge for them in this lawsuit against Meta, at least.
*  And that's because of a law that's broadly known as Section 230 that really protects
*  these platforms from the content that people post on the site.
*  So it's very difficult for someone to come along and sue Instagram because of that content.
*  You know, it's somewhat akin, actually, to the gun context with that 2005 law, PLACA,
*  and it's a legal hurdle that many people have thought makes these kinds of suits not impossible,
*  but very, very difficult.
*  Koskof is pushing on that wall in the same way that he's been pushing on the PLACA wall
*  in the gun context.
*  And what makes these suits novel and sort of surprising is he went from trying to force
*  open one door while also pushing on another very difficult door.
*  And so he's really kind of doubled his difficulty with these suits.
*  But he believes that, as we've discussed, the evidence in this case is striking enough
*  that it makes it plausible.
*  And what is Meta saying in response?
*  Well, Meta has not said anything about this lawsuit.
*  In fact, I followed up, you know, and, you know, they don't have a public comment about it.
*  David, all of these arguments seem extremely difficult to make.
*  How likely is it that these cases actually go anywhere?
*  Well, you know, I think at this point, it's pretty hard to say, but there's a lot of hurdles
*  standing in his way in both cases.
*  You know, he's not just going after a gun manufacturer.
*  He's going after one of the biggest social media companies and a huge video game company,
*  which just happens to be owned by Microsoft.
*  So, you know, this case could get thrown out in the initial process.
*  You know, he may lose if he ever gets to trial at that point.
*  But what Koskoff is trying to do here and what other lawyers I talked to said is to
*  really try and sort of shift the conversation away from the person and also kind of away
*  from the gun to looking at what is the culture that surrounds these kids.
*  And there is a sense in, I think, America right now that there is something sort of
*  off around social media use and teenagers.
*  You know, I asked Koskoff about this, you know, his lawsuit is kind of hitting at a
*  time when there's broad discussion of, you know, the potential harms of social media.
*  But I think what he's been able to do in this suit is reframe some of those arguments around
*  very specific data from this one shooter's online activities and really paint a picture
*  of how these three prongs came together to create one shooter and, you know, possibly
*  allow the families some way to get accountability or and actually hold someone liable for the
*  shooting that really isn't available through any other means.
*  And so, you know, for Koskoff, just doing that is worth trying.
*  David, thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Rachel.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin is visiting North Korea.
*  Putin is expected to ask North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for more weapons for Russia's
*  war with Ukraine.
*  This will be the second meeting between the two men in the last nine months, a sign of
*  Russia and North Korea's deepening military ties.
*  And on Monday, Maryland Governor Wes Moore pardoned about 100,000 people for low-level
*  marijuana offenses like possession.
*  The move comes as more and more states are legalizing marijuana and pardoning marijuana-related
*  crimes, which criminal justice advocates say disproportionately affect people of color.
*  Putin's attorney general said about the pardons, quote, Today is about equity.
*  It is about racial justice.
*  Today's episode was produced by Diana Nguyen, Bolivia Natt, and Sydney Harper.
