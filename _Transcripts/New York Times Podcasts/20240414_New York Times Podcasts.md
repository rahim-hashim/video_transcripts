# The Sunday Read: ‘What I Saw Working at The National Enquirer During Donald Trump’s Rise’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqcLq-I23f4)
*  My name is Lachlan Cartwright. I'm a special correspondent for The Hollywood Reporter and
*  a contributor to the New York Times Magazine. This week's Sunday Read is a deeply personal
*  story to me. But it also, strangely enough, centres around the New York criminal trial
*  of former President Donald Trump. In that case, the Manhattan District Attorney,
*  Alvin Bragg, is prosecuting Trump on 34 counts of falsifying business records. The indictments
*  allege that he made hush money payments to ensure the silence of individuals with damaging information
*  just months before the 2016 election. People like Dino Sjudin, a former Trump World Tower doorman
*  who claimed that Trump had a love child with one of the building's employees. And Karen McDougall,
*  with whom Trump supposedly had an extramarital affair. They received $30,000 and $150,000,
*  respectively. But the key here is that the payments to these people were facilitated
*  by American Media, the tabloid news organisation and parent company of the National Enquirer.
*  Because the Enquirer owned the rights to their stories, stories that would have been negative
*  press against Trump and chose not to publish them but rather bury them, meant that they were
*  essentially being purchased off the market on his behalf. And so, the reason why this is personal
*  for me is because I witnessed all of this. At the time, I was the executive editor of the Enquirer.
*  This story is my insider's account of the behind the scenes at American Media and how it turned
*  itself into a criminal enterprise to protect the rich and powerful. I witnessed how the Enquirer
*  became part of the Trump campaign, not only suppressing stories to help him but also running
*  negative stories about Trump's rivals. No one else has ever been able to tell this story before
*  because of stringent non-disclosure agreements. Despite threats of litigation, this is the first
*  time I'm sharing my story. So, here's my article, read by David Linsky. Our audio producer is Jack
*  DeSodoro. The music you'll hear was written and performed by Aaron Esposito.
*  On Tuesday, April 4, 2023, I was outside Manhattan Criminal Court. It was a sunny spring day,
*  and the Secret Service and the police department had blocked off the streets with barricades.
*  The sidewalks were clogged with news crews from around the world. Supporters of Donald Trump
*  roamed a pen that was set up to house them. Eventually, the former president was rushed out
*  of the courthouse after being charged by Alvin Bragg, the District Attorney of Manhattan,
*  with 34 counts of falsifying business records. His convoy departed to cheers from fans.
*  I pulled up the indictment and the statement of facts on my iPhone.
*  At the centre of the case is the accusation that Trump took part in a scheme to turn the
*  National Enquirer and its sister publications into an arm of his 2016 presidential campaign.
*  The documents detailed three hush money payments made to a series of individuals to guarantee
*  their silence about potentially damaging stories in the months before the election.
*  Because this was done with the goal of helping his election chances, the case implied these
*  payments amounted to a form of illegal, undisclosed campaign spending. And Bragg argued because Trump
*  created paperwork to make the payments seem like regular legal expenses, that amounted to a criminal
*  effort at a cover-up. Trump has denied the charges against him. The documents rattled off a number of
*  seedy stories that would have been right at home in a venerable supermarket tabloid had they actually
*  been published. The subjects were anonymised but recognisable to anyone who had followed the story
*  of Trump's entanglement with the Enquirer. His affair with the porn star Stormy Daniels, of course,
*  was the heart of it. There was also Karen McDougall, the Playboy Playmate of the year in 1998,
*  whose affair with Trump was similarly made to disappear. The payments for the rights to her
*  story made to look like fees for writing a fitness column and appearing on magazine covers.
*  Trump has denied involvement with both women. There were others that were lesser known too,
*  like Dino Sjudin, a former Trump World Tower doorman who claimed that Trump had a love child
*  with one of the building's employees. The story was never published and Sjudin was paid $30,000
*  to keep quiet about it. For me, reading the indictment was like stepping through the looking
*  glass because it described a three-year period in my own professional life, one that I've come to
*  deeply regret. Dino the doorman, during my time at American Media Inc, AMI, the Enquirer's parent
*  company, I was one of the editors pushing our reporters to confirm that story. McDougall's
*  fitness columns were published only after I instructed a colleague to work with the model
*  to put them together. These were all pretty normal things to do during my time there,
*  a life-changing detour in my career which happened to coincide with a bizarre period at AMI
*  when it was allegedly enlisted, in some ways that I saw and in others that I didn't, into the service
*  of helping Trump become president. Now, as a former president faces a criminal trial for the first
*  time in American history, I'm forced to grapple with what really happened at the Enquirer in those
*  years and whether and how I can ever set things right. In a sense, it was Philip Seymour Hoffman
*  who got me the job. In February 2014, while I was working at the New York Daily News, an editor there
*  told me that Hoffman had been found dead in his West Village apartment. He asked for my help on
*  the story. Our crime reporters tracked down the name of the person who found the body, David Barr
*  Katz, a close friend of Hoffman's and a playwright, but all our attempts to reach him had not borne
*  fruit. Soon the National Enquirer hit newsstands with an exclusive interview with Katz. He said
*  that he and Hoffman were homosexual lovers and that he watched Hoffman freebase cocaine the night
*  before his death. The story quickly unraveled. The Enquirer had been talking to a David Katz,
*  but this one was a freelance TV producer based in New Jersey. After being bombarded with calls
*  from reporters and consuming several beers, he later told the New York Post he apparently
*  decided to have some fun. The actual David Barr Katz sued AMI for $50 million. The magazine
*  withdrew the story and settled out of court. In the end, the Enquirer took out a full-page ad in
*  the New York Times, acknowledging the error and paid Katz enough that he was able to establish
*  an annual prize for playwrights in Hoffman's honour. David Pecker, the chief executive of AMI,
*  removed the top editor. In his place, Pecker pulled a young editor named Dylan Howard over
*  from another AMI publication, Radar Online. Howard and I met a few years earlier in New York. He
*  attended the same university I did in Melbourne, though we weren't friends in Australia. Now,
*  two Aussie journalists in New York, we swapped gossip and hit it off. I helped land him one of
*  his biggest scoops. In 2010, I passed Charlie Sheen's private cell number to him, and he figured
*  out that texting Sheen when he was partying would get his attention. The two developed a rapport,
*  and after a series of well-publicised meltdowns, Sheen invited Howard to Los Angeles to watch him
*  take a drug test and reveal the results live on Good Morning America. In March 2014, Howard and I
*  started talking about the possibility of my coming to the Inquirer as his number two. During a
*  booze-filled night at the Electric Room, a nightclub in the Meatpacking District, he walked me through
*  the offer. A $60,000 bump in compensation, which worked out to a 75% raise. And I would be running
*  a national news operation with the resources he promised to break agenda-setting stories.
*  I had never paid that much attention to the supermarket tabloids, but I knew enough to
*  know what the Inquirer was. It published a sensational mix of celebrity scandal, true crime,
*  and triumph over tragedy real-life stories. It might not have been a respected newspaper,
*  especially because of its tendency to print cover lines that stretch the truth to the breaking point.
*  But it's not as if it published stories about Batboy either. That's the weekly world news.
*  The Inquirer's reporters were fearless, and they did sometimes win the respect of the mainstream
*  press. During the wrongful death suit brought against O.J. Simpson by the parents of Nicole
*  Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, it was the Inquirer's reporters who found photos of Simpson
*  wearing Bruno Mali shoes, the same type that left prints in blood at the scene of the murders.
*  The revelation helped a jury decide that Simpson could be held responsible for the deaths.
*  By the time I started, the Inquirer's weekly newsstand sales figures hovered around 360,000,
*  down from a high of about 4 million in the 1990s. Still, even in recent years, the Inquirer had
*  broken big stories. In fact, the tabloid most likely altered the course of the 2008 presidential
*  election when it exposed John Edwards' affair and love child with a campaign staff member.
*  That investigation showed the muscle and drive of the Inquirer's reporting. Stakeouts, door knocks,
*  documents, reporters flying across the country, persisting until they got the story right.
*  Howard told me that he wanted the magazine to land ambitious stories like that.
*  All things going well, he texted me, a bit hyperbolically,
*  you and I will be youngest editors of a national US publication ever. I was agonising over the
*  offer when the editor in chief of the Daily News, Colin Myler, called me into his office.
*  Myler presented me with a $10,000 raise and thanked me for my work. I thought he might have
*  caught wind of the job offer, so I mentioned to him. He said I would be making a big mistake if
*  I went to work for David Pecker. Deep down, I was hoping Myler would make a counteroffer,
*  but he didn't. I took Howard on his word. Ultimately, my hubris sealed the deal.
*  I started as executive editor of the Inquirer and Radar Online in mid-May. What I soon learned is
*  Howard, even if he wanted to, wouldn't be changing the operation. Pecker really ran the place.
*  On Monday, Wednesday and Friday evenings, there were cover meetings when Howard and the editors
*  of the Inquirer's sister titles would go before Pecker and several of his top lieutenants to show
*  a few options and analyse sales figures. If one title had a week-to-week decline, Pecker became
*  apoplectic. I would walk through the back of the newsroom near Pecker's office and hear him
*  screaming through the walls. Sometimes Pecker would suggest a preferred cover line, forcing
*  us to twist a story to fit the language. In that paranoid environment, all anyone cared about was
*  not incurring Pecker's wrath and being fired. Pecker did not respond to requests for comment.
*  A frustrating first year spent in a windowless office was suddenly interrupted on the afternoon
*  of March 29, 2015, when a source told me about a woman named Ambra Batilana Gutierrez who went to
*  the New York Police Department after being groped by Harvey Weinstein in Tribeca.
*  My pulse was racing. Finally, a worthwhile scoop. There had been rumours about Weinstein and women
*  for years. Affairs, the casting couch and worse. I called Howard and was struck by his response.
*  He seemed less interested in the story than in the identity of my source. In response to questions
*  from the Times, Howard said he was simply vetting the story's sourcing, a routine part of his job
*  duties. I could not figure out his attitude. But before we got any further, the Daily News broke
*  the story with the help of police sources. But Gutierrez still hadn't spoken publicly and Howard
*  went into overdrive trying to buy her side of the story. The inquirer, like many tabloids,
*  sometimes paid sources for exclusive stories. This is not an acceptable practice in most newsrooms
*  or in the ones I've worked in since. Still, it seemed odd that we were trying to buy a story
*  that we could have had free. Cash, really no object, Howard messaged me. So I can sling your
*  source 5k to get it done in addition to her 20k. But Gutierrez didn't want $20,000. She wanted her
*  story heard. And it continued to roll out in other outlets through leaks from law enforcement and
*  movie industry sources who framed the matter in the media as a blackmail attempt. Howard was in
*  and out of my office asking for updates. I think the stakes just increased, he texted me. And your
*  source could earn some big bucks. I texted the source saying that Gutierrez could ask for any
*  amount of money and that the source could take a substantial cut. She's less concerned with money
*  than the right moves, the source responded. By the middle of the week, Howard told me to offer
*  Gutierrez $150,000 with a $25,000 finders fee to my go-between. An extraordinary amount of money.
*  Most stories we bought cost us about a few thousand dollars. Howard says he was merely conveying
*  offers at the direction of Pekka. She says no, the source texted back. Don't ask again.
*  Unknown to me at the time, Weinstein had all but secured a guarantee that we would never report on
*  his sexual transgressions. Earlier that year, the Weinstein company signed a deal with AMI to
*  produce something called Radar TV. The plan was to take our celebrity coverage from Radar online
*  and use it to make a daily live TV show in the mold of Access Hollywood. The deal entailed lots
*  of lunches between Weinstein and Howard at Tribeca Grill, but never resulted in an actual TV show.
*  Still, the partnership did make Weinstein a FOP, friend of Pekka, which entitled him to protection
*  from negative coverage. He was also able to leverage his relationship with AMI to use our
*  vast newsgathering resources to collect dirt on the actresses who he thought might talk to the press.
*  The New York Post, the Daily Mail and other outlets painted Gutierrez as a gold digger
*  who had attended the bunga bunga parties of Prime Minister Silvio Belisconi of Italy.
*  Years later, I learned that one of AMI's top lawyers had informed someone in the office of
*  Cy Vance, the Manhattan District Attorney at the time, that Gutierrez was trying to sell her story
*  to us. Vance's office eventually announced that it would not pursue charges against Weinstein.
*  In the end, Gutierrez reached a settlement with Weinstein and went on to tell her story to the press.
*  A couple of months later, Trump descended the escalator at Trump Tower.
*  Editorial discussions about John Travolta, Lisa Marie Presley and Bill Cosby were now
*  interspersed with chatter about Hillary Clinton, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.
*  The headlines that resulted were not ambiguous.
*  Why I am the only choice for President.
*  Exclusive, Donald Trump writes for the Enquirer.
*  He didn't. A colleague cobbled the piece together and Michael Cohen, Trump's lawyer and go-between
*  with AMI, got Trump's approval for it. Who's Chelsea's real dad?
*  Pres hopeful Hillary's moment of truth. Exclusive DNA test results bombshell.
*  We had mounted an operation to collect Chelsea Clinton's trash in an effort to get her DNA.
*  But because Clinton lived in a big Manhattan apartment building,
*  it was virtually impossible to get access to her garbage.
*  We instead got a sample off a pen she used to sign a book.
*  The results were inconclusive, but we published the story anyway.
*  Hillary, six months to live. Cruel Bill forces her to stay on campaign trail.
*  These covers came with doctored images of Clinton looking frail, bolstered by quotes
*  from anyone who would say the right things and had a title that tenuously qualified him
*  to offer an opinion.
*  The Enquirer did employ real reporters who would comb through documents,
*  cultivate sources and use old school reporting techniques.
*  But I was coming to terms with the other side of the magazine, where a headline was chosen
*  and editors and writers spun up a tenuous story to match.
*  This all came on the heels of a family tragedy that made my job seem even more detestable and stupid.
*  In the spring, my dad grew ill and when he finally got to a doctor,
*  irregularities were found in his blood. Stomach cancer. Stage four.
*  He was told he had three months to live.
*  I had a contentious relationship with him during my adolescence,
*  and by 22 I had moved to London to pursue journalism.
*  He and my mother would visit, but because I was gay and hiding this from them,
*  it kept us distant.
*  But because I was gay and hiding this from them, it kept us distant.
*  Soon after my younger brother came out, I asked my father how he was dealing with it.
*  It could be worse, he told me. We could have two of them.
*  When I finally came out several years later, my father took it in and asked me,
*  Are you sure you're not bi?
*  It took a few years, but he came to terms with having two sons who weren't straight.
*  By the time of his 70th birthday, he had visited me in New York,
*  and we ran around town like teenagers. He would tell me it was one of the best weeks of his life.
*  I landed back in Melbourne just in time. When I had last seen my dad a few months earlier,
*  he was a fit 71 year old. Now the colour had drained from his skin.
*  His voice was hoarse as we hugged.
*  Just nine days after I landed, he was admitted to a palliative care facility.
*  He was unconscious, but we talked to him as if he were lucid.
*  We all slept in his room. I lay awake and listened as his breaths got further and further apart.
*  Just after 5am on May 1st, 2015, he took his last.
*  I buried my father and returned to New York, dazed by grief.
*  I cried in the shower before work. I sat blankly in editorial meetings.
*  I don't know how I would have responded to the events that followed had I not been so depressed.
*  But the truth is that I was. I was drinking heavily, and life felt hopeless.
*  I was angry. I became lazy. Even a little bit crazy.
*  In the fall, we got a startling tip over the transom from a former doorman at Trump World Tower
*  who said that Trump had an affair with a woman who worked in the building.
*  That she had given birth to a secret love child.
*  The tip line was a lot of fun, but presented its fair share of headaches.
*  Because we advertised that we paid for stories, we got all types of chances
*  and charlatans trying their luck. So we proceeded cautiously, not only because of that,
*  but also because we knew Trump was a fop. Howard had to check with the boss before
*  we could make any moves. The word came back that we could proceed,
*  and we quickly signed the tipster Dino Sjudin to a source contract that would pay $30,000
*  if we ran his story. We assigned a team of reporters to firm it up. Before any calls were
*  made, we wanted to ensure that we had photos of both the woman and the love child in hand
*  in case they went to ground. There was a stakeout at the home of the woman.
*  Another reporter was sent to the address of the love child.
*  With photos of both secured, we arranged for Sjudin to sit for a polygraph. This was standard
*  practice for stories that could draw legal action from a subject. We had two private
*  investigators who would routinely conduct lie detector tests on sources before we ran their
*  stories. It was an extra layer of insurance, especially because the inquirer was a constant
*  target of lawsuits. A polygraph could demonstrate that we had gone above and beyond to confirm that
*  a source was telling the truth. We would sometimes spike stories when sources failed polygraphs,
*  but over time I came to feel that the tests were a cynical way of manufacturing a good faith effort
*  before publication. Sjudin passed his polygraph, but it turned out that the information was
*  second hand. He had heard his colleagues talking about it and had no proof. He had serious
*  credibility issues besides. If you ran his name through Google, you would find an anonymous website
*  that accused Sjudin of making similar allegations about a Trump World Tower resident. I could hear
*  from Howard's office that Michael Cohen was calling and I assumed he was looking for updates.
*  I had my doubts about the story, especially as the love adult, as I was now calling her,
*  she was in her late 20s, looked just like the man named on her birth certificate,
*  who was not Donald Trump. Then out of nowhere the order came to stand down.
*  Pekka made the call to pay Sjudin $30,000 and the story was killed without Howard explaining why.
*  It was an enormous amount of money to pay someone, especially for a story we were not running. In
*  December a reporter met Sjudin, Adam McDonald's, in Pennsylvania to present him with the check.
*  In return he signed a new contract that stipulated that if he told the story to any third parties,
*  he would be on the hook for a million dollars in damages to AMI. It was a highly unusual clause.
*  The signed contract was put into a safe. A colleague who was working with me described what
*  happened as a catch and kill. It was the first time I had heard the phrase, but it would not be the last.
*  As we hurtled toward the presidential primaries, there was a laser focus on stories about Trump's
*  rivals. Ben Carson, we alleged, had left a sponge in a woman's brain. Bernie Sanders, we accused,
*  without any evidence of being caught in a child sex probe. Marco Rubio, or at least someone with
*  a similar haircut, had been photographed at a Manfest foam party. While I had serious misgivings
*  about publishing stories like these, which took cues from sites like Infowars and the Gateway Pundit,
*  it also felt totally meaningless. Would anyone take this stuff seriously? I also quieted my
*  conscience by continuing to drink heavily every night. Ted Cruz was a major target. We ran thinly
*  sourced stories that suggested that he was a raging alcoholic who had five secret mistresses
*  and was named in a madam's black book. And we ran a cover story linking his father,
*  Rafael, to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. That article hinged on a grainy photo contained
*  in the Warren Commission report purporting to show Lee Harvey Oswald handing out pro-Castro
*  flyers with Rafael Cruz. The money quote came from a guy who ran a photo digitization website
*  who told the reporter with a high degree of confidence that it was the same person.
*  Then, much to everyone's surprise and my horror, the Cruz story was picked up by the mainstream
*  media. Trump went on Fox News to repeat the claims and the Cruz campaign was forced to respond.
*  I watched in Howard's office dumbfounded as Cruz denied the story on CNN.
*  I was eventually moved into a better office, one that had windows and an old safe about the
*  size of a mini-fridge. The Sir Juden contract was inside it and I used it as a footrest.
*  My old office meanwhile was littered with dozens of boxes that had been brought up from AMI's
*  offices in Boca Raton, Florida. This was all the material the newsroom had collected on the Clintons
*  over the decades. I was directed to hire a freelance researcher to go through them and
*  generate memos so we could gin up hit pieces. The Inquirer had a similar archive of files on Trump,
*  perhaps the most amazing trove of Trump material of any national media organization,
*  but it was not receiving the same careful review. Instead, I was going through the
*  memos from the freelancer that provided the basis for spurious stories accusing Hillary Clinton of
*  forming a hit squad to kill Vince Foster. Then we moved on to hyperbolic material on Bill Clinton
*  and women. Hillary's hiding Bill's sex crimes. 36 women break their silence was the cover that
*  landed in May 2016. Between those were a drumbeat of fictitious health crises for the former first
*  lady and presidential candidate. With the help of so-called medical experts, typically publicity
*  hungry pundits who understood what we wanted to hear and the assistance of a talented art department,
*  we tried to kill her off in print almost weekly. She would appear with her eyes made baggy and the
*  colors in the images desaturated. In others, she swelled to fit the cover line that she had gained
*  103 pounds and was eating herself to death. In another, we purported to have her full medical file
*  which as the cover screamed said she had three strokes, Alzheimer's, liver damage from booze,
*  and violent rages. We had another secret weapon, Michael Silvestre. By day, Silvestre worked at the
*  Walt Disney Company, but at night he operated Truth and Deception Technologies in Florida.
*  We would send Silvestre audio clips of politicians or celebrities speaking and after using software
*  that he called Deceptek voice stress analysis, he sent back charts at $500 per test.
*  Hillary failed secret FBI lie detector was one such cover. We had no reason to believe Deceptek
*  had been used by the FBI. We went to him so often that I could signal that we required his services
*  again by using a cranking hand motion. In August, Howard told me he had met with a former Playboy
*  playmate named Karen McDougall who said she had an affair with Trump. The woman was being represented
*  by a lawyer, Keith Davidson, and Howard said he found her story credible. Howard told me that
*  Pecker bought her story for $150,000, but that it would never see the light of day.
*  It was the second catch-and-kill on Trump's behalf that I heard about. I started to avoid Howard as
*  best as I could. Our interactions became icy and colleagues in the newsroom started to notice.
*  I felt as if I were being suffocated, and I feared that being near all of this would mean the end of
*  my career. Late in the afternoon, on the Friday before the 2016 election, I received a call from
*  Lucas Alpert, a Wall Street Journal reporter. He and I used to work together at the New York Post,
*  and we kept in touch. He was on the media desk now, but explained that he had been asked by a
*  colleague on the investigative team for help on a story. Did I know anything about a woman
*  named Karen McDougall? I froze. I was in the newsroom and only feet from Howard.
*  I told Alpert I would call him back. I walked to the elevator and rode it down to the entrance of
*  the building. I explained the huge risk I was taking by helping him and the consequences if
*  Pecker or Howard found out. I thought if I used an old-school tabloid term it would give me some
*  cover. Only the guys who had been there forever used that term. This was a catch and kill,
*  I told Alpert. What's a catch and kill? He asked. I went on to explain the tabloid practice of
*  buying stories to bury them. Alpert already had the outline of the story, I learned, and I filled
*  him in on more. How Howard had flown out to Los Angeles that summer to buy McDougall's story for
*  $150,000 with the direction from Pecker to kill it to protect Trump. I stressed to him the importance
*  of the term catch and kill and told him that if the journal included it, it would give me some
*  breathing room. I went back to my office and closed the door. My heart was racing and I was sweating.
*  A short time later Howard burst in. The Wall Street Journal has a story coming,
*  I recall him saying, before naming two former employees, blaming them for the leak. He slammed
*  the door shut. The story went live after nine that night. National Enquirer shielded Donald Trump
*  from Playboy Models Affair allegation. And there it was in the third paragraph. Quashing stories
*  that way is known in the tabloid world as catch and kill. I didn't hear from Howard that weekend.
*  No one thought Trump was going to win at that point and the story was swallowed up in the
*  pre-election frenzy. That same week I had finally hit my breaking point with the job.
*  A few days earlier Howard called me into his office. He explained that we would be crashing
*  a late exclusive. He had obtained a seven-page dossier that contained what he said were emails
*  between Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin, one of her long-time aides. The only snag was that the
*  emails were in Italian and we had just hours to get them translated if we wanted any chance of
*  meeting our print deadlines. Howard told me that Pekka had spent thousands of dollars to buy the
*  file from a private investigator. Pekka was always paranoid about leaks and had paid this
*  investigator's firm to do sweeps of AMI's office looking for listening devices. And now the
*  investigator had become a source. In response to questions from the Times, the investigator said he
*  could not remember many details of this episode. The dossier Howard explained had come to our
*  source via the Agenzia Informazione e Sicurezza Esterna, Italian intelligence, where the source
*  apparently had connections. This is why the emails, though originally written in English,
*  were in Italian. The agency had received the emails from Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service,
*  the source said, which had itself hacked Clinton's servers and obtained the emails from a laptop
*  Abedin shared with her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner. Despite the many red flags and ethical
*  questions that chain of custody raised, Howard believed in the dossier. And besides, Pekka had
*  already decreed that this would be the cover story. The research team had found two New York
*  University students to translate the documents. When they arrived, I was instructed to confiscate
*  their cell phones. The translators finished and we managed to close the issue by midnight.
*  Hillary and Hooma going to jail was the cover line, with bullet points claiming, among other
*  things, a secret hospitalisation and truth about gay affair. The translations in the article were
*  totally garbled and the inferences we made from them were absurd. While it made its way to the
*  printers, I went with Howard and some colleagues to Whitehorse Tavern, not the famous one, the one in
*  the Financial District. He was buzzing with glee. I could barely look him in the eyes.
*  I needed to get out, but I needed my visa to stay in the country and find another job. I held on to
*  the thought that this would all soon be over. The election was just six days away. Clinton looked
*  sure to win. Trump would fade away. I would be able to find my way out and back to actual journalism.
*  Instead, my duties somehow became even more depraved. When the Wall Street Journal contacted AMI for
*  comment about the $150,000 payment to Karen McDougall, the company claimed that the money
*  was not to kill her story, but rather to purchase her life rights to any relationship she has had
*  with a then married man, as well as two years of fitness columns and magazine covers. This had in
*  fact been stipulated in the contract AMI drew up with her lawyer, but now we had to actually come
*  up with the columns. I signed a report at a Ghost Write them, and he got on a call with McDougall
*  to take notes while cribbing fitness tips from the internet. Alpert and his colleagues at the
*  Journal were chasing fresh leads. I mentioned the doorman and the events of the previous year.
*  Alpert asked for the names, so I opened the safe and got out the contract. I was able to
*  open the safe and got out the contract, which contained notes with the names of the woman
*  and the love adult. I texted them to Alpert, put the documents back and went to close the safe,
*  but the door wouldn't shut. I tried desperately, but this rickety old safe refused to close.
*  I was starting to panic. At any time, Howard could come in. I turned up the sound on my office TV as
*  I sat hammering at this old metal door. Finally, the bloody thing shut.
*  After Trump won, I could not hide my utter contempt for Howard. My position as his deputy became
*  untenable. By this point, the two of us were barely on speaking terms. I wasted my afternoons
*  drinking alone in nearby bars and restaurants while I devised an exit strategy. I retained an
*  employment attorney, knowing that both Howard and Pecker would love nothing more than to screw me
*  on the way out. Howard was enraged by my behaviour and made it known to others in the newsroom.
*  In July 2017, after weeks of negotiations, I was presented with a nine-page separation agreement.
*  I would be kept on as an employee for the next nine months collecting half my salary as a form
*  of severance. That meant I would be able to continue living in the United States until my visa
*  expired. But the price would be my silence, a non-disclosure agreement covering AMI in general
*  and Pecker in particular. The contract's language was so broad that it prohibited me
*  in perpetuity from even writing a work of fiction about my time at the company.
*  On August 4th, I entered the morning news meeting for the final time.
*  Howard announced to the staff I would be working from home for the foreseeable future.
*  I looked him in the eye and shook his hand. It would be the last time I saw him.
*  About six weeks after I left, and around the time The New York Times and The New Yorker broke the
*  Weinstein story, I was walking back to my apartment when I got a call from my attorney.
*  AMI's lawyers had sent him a letter accusing me of breaching my non-disclosure agreement on
*  three occasions. The letter threatened termination and damages, but it was the next sentence that
*  got me. In the event AMI terminates Mr. Cartwright's employment, he will not be entitled to lawfully
*  remain in the USA. I vomited. They might not have known what I'd actually done, but it seemed they
*  were trying to scare me into silence. I resolved that if I was approached by a journalist whom I
*  trusted and who I knew would protect me, I would do my best to help. Someone out there could do the
*  work I should have been doing all along. A few weeks later I received a direct message on Twitter
*  from a New York Times reporter. I responded to him with my cell number and agreed to meet.
*  I told the reporter what happened in 2015 with Gutierrez. I detailed Howard's requests for
*  damaging information on women connected to Weinstein, which usually followed their regular
*  Tribeca lunches. Howard says he never asked Inquirer staffers to share damaging information
*  on women connected to Weinstein, but I stressed that the real story was the Inquirer's work
*  on behalf of Trump. Eventually I got a burner phone as I was in almost daily contact with the
*  reporter at the Times, my contact at the Journal and others. It was hard to keep them all straight.
*  I emailed the New Yorker writer Ronan Farrow with the subject line,
*  signal. Are you on it? I asked. He was in touch an hour later and I began telling him what happened
*  with Dino the Doorman. It became clear to me that reporters from the Journal were in possession of
*  information that could have come from only a small circle of people and I feared that the source was
*  Howard. If the reporters I had been talking to were incautious, they could have easily
*  revealed to him that I had been a source too. It would be the ammunition Howard needed to terminate
*  my agreement and have me booted from the country. But on the other hand, if he was a source, how could
*  he tell Pekka that he had learned I was too? These paranoid thoughts kept me up at night.
*  I had heard AMI sometimes tailed current and former employees. I became convinced that the
*  same was happening to me. That might explain an incident that took place one evening when I went
*  to Babeland, an adult store in Soho, and walked out with a dildo, lubricant and condoms. As I
*  exited the store, a car pulled up and out jumped a man with a camera who proceeded in the most
*  indiscreet way to take a series of photos of me with a bright flash. Before I knew it, he had jumped
*  back in the car and it sped off. Were those photos going to be used to embarrass me? Was it a way
*  to scare me? With just weeks left on my visa, I had spent six months working free as a source,
*  a self-imposed sentence for my many crimes against journalism. By this time, I was in the
*  late stages of interviews for a new job with the Daily Beast and an opportunity to resuscitate my
*  byline. Since I left AMI, I have lived under constant threat of litigation from my former
*  employer. AMI has threatened me with a $5 million lawsuit for breach of contract. Howard has
*  threatened me with another $5 million suit over articles I wrote for the Daily Beast, accusing me
*  of defamation and breach of contract. But now the facts of what happened are a matter of public
*  record, the basis for the first ever criminal trial of a former president. Indeed, Pecker and
*  Howard have already testified before Bragg's grand jury. If they're called again to testify at the
*  trial, they will in all likelihood be revealing some of the same information they tried to
*  intimidate me into withholding. As I've tried to come to terms with just how corrupt an organization
*  I worked for in those years, I've taken some comfort in the fact that acting as a source for
*  other journalists helped rebalance the scales, not only for me but for the public too.
*  After the last legal threat Howard sent me in October 2020, a lawyer representing me wrote a
*  strongly worded letter in response, arguing that the information I shared was in the public interest
*  and in some cases it was of profound national importance. The letters stopped, no suits have
*  been filed. Three years after leaving the building for the last time, I finally felt free of the place.
*  Then the Bragg indictment outlined in plain and unafraid black and white the schemes that felt
*  so opaque and contentious and complex when I had to navigate my way through them in real time.
*  But it was the 13-page statement of facts that brought me to tears. On page three prosecutors
*  outlined the catch-and-kill scheme to suppress negative information and it revealed to me that
*  I had been managing a newsroom with improvised explosive devices planted everywhere. The secret
*  deal that was made at Trump Tower where Pecker told Cohen he would act as the campaign's eyes and ears.
*  The hush money payoffs, the plot to publish negative stories about Trump's rivals, a scheme
*  to influence the 2016 election. Everything finally fit into place.
*  There were no more secrets and I wasn't alone anymore. Everyone now knew.
