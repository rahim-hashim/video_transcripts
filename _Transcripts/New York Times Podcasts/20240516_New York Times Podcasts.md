# The Make-or-Break Testimony of Michael Cohen
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVrtlWJbFk4)
*  I'm just leaving my apartment again.
*  6 14 a.m. Monday, May 13th.
*  Recording one of my little voice memos again.
*  I do feel like a goofball doing it.
*  But they keep publishing them.
*  Today is, well, it's the climax of the prosecution's case today.
*  We're expecting to see Michael Cohen.
*  He's Trump's former fixer.
*  Cohen worked for years for Trump,
*  fixing his problems, cleaning up his messes.
*  So funny that Cohen has become that mess.
*  He's going to face his old boss in court today
*  and make a giant problem for him if prosecutors have their way.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, what happened when Donald Trump's most loyal lieutenant
*  took the stand against him in the most important testimony
*  of the Hush Money trial?
*  As always, Jonah Bromwich was in the room.
*  It's Thursday, May 16th.
*  Hey, friend.
*  How are you?
*  I'm all right.
*  It's good.
*  You rested?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You know how rested I am.
*  Not at all.
*  Woke up at 4.20 this morning.
*  Discuss?
*  Yeah.
*  I'm having trouble sleeping much later than that.
*  I mean, I wake up at 4.45 every morning on trial days.
*  I know.
*  It's insane.
*  It's really crazy.
*  OK.
*  Are you ready?
*  Yes.
*  Jonah, the last time we dropped in on this case with you
*  was when Stormy Daniels was on the stand last week.
*  Today, we're talking to you because it's Michael Cohen now
*  on the stand.
*  And you had always explained to us
*  from the beginning of this trial,
*  Cohen was the prosecution's biggest weapon
*  and potentially its biggest liability.
*  He's the linchpin of their case, you told us,
*  because as Trump's former right-hand man,
*  he made the Hush Money payment at the center of this trial,
*  without which there would be no case.
*  But Cohen is also a proven liar with an ax
*  to grind against Trump.
*  So he's just an incredibly complicated figure.
*  That's exactly right.
*  So Cohen is the line that connects
*  all the dots of this trial.
*  He knows most of the witnesses.
*  And not only did he make the Hush Money payment
*  to Stormy Daniels that's at issue here,
*  he is also the person who was reimbursed
*  for that payment by Trump and the only person who
*  can link Trump to what prosecutors say
*  was the criminal disguise of those records used to pay him.
*  Trump is charged with 34 felonies.
*  Every single one of those felonies
*  is attached to a document that was
*  involved in the repayment of Michael Cohen for the Hush
*  Money to Stormy Daniels.
*  Right.
*  I mean, it can't be overstated how much the criminality
*  alleged in this trial entirely revolves around Michael Cohen's
*  role in it.
*  Yes.
*  OK.
*  So he takes the stand.
*  Walk us through that.
*  When a witness takes the stand in this trial
*  and many other trials, they begin
*  talking about their educational history
*  and their professional background.
*  It's usually the most boring part of their testimony,
*  frankly.
*  You need to know where these people came from
*  and the jury needs to know, more importantly.
*  But sometimes we zone out a little bit
*  during that part because we want to quote unquote
*  get to the good stuff.
*  With Cohen, the quote unquote good stuff,
*  meaning the relevant part of his testimony,
*  begins almost immediately.
*  What do you mean?
*  Michael Cohen begins to explain from the stand
*  how he came into Trump's orbit.
*  And it starts from afar.
*  This is a guy who idolized Donald Trump, who
*  saw him as the symbol of wealth and power
*  and kind of this place where aggression and money making
*  meet in the kind of go-go 80s.
*  And so Cohen likes that.
*  He's attracted to that.
*  He wanted to be a Wall Street guy himself.
*  And so he even fashions himself to some extent in the Trump
*  mold.
*  He begins buying property in Trump's buildings.
*  Soon he catches Trump's eye.
*  And before you know it, Michael Cohen
*  is being asked by Trump, he testifies,
*  if he wants to leave his sleepy old law firm
*  and come work for Trump at the Trump Organization.
*  He's going to report directly to him.
*  And soon enough, Michael Cohen is going to be calling Donald
*  Trump either the boss or just boss.
*  Right, and where things would be anything but sleepy.
*  That's right.
*  So Cohen moves into Trump's world.
*  And immediately he's doing this nasty, shady-ish work
*  for Donald J. Trump.
*  This involves negotiating down Trump's bills.
*  He uses Cohen to say, Mr. Trump isn't going to owe you that
*  much, he's actually going to owe you this much.
*  And it also involves yelling at reporters.
*  Trump cares a lot about what's said about him in the media.
*  And so he asks Cohen to call reporters
*  who have written stories that Trump doesn't like
*  and yell at them and tell them that they're
*  going to be sued if they don't change or take down
*  what they've written.
*  Right, and here I have to confess,
*  I am one of the journalists who endured these screaming
*  sessions with Michael Cohen when I was writing about Trump's
*  university and its alleged scandals,
*  when I was writing about Trump's real estate problems.
*  I ended up on the phone with Michael Cohen.
*  And man, he was relentless.
*  He was bullying.
*  And you kind of left the phone call traumatized.
*  Yeah, there's an elite group of you.
*  I've heard from many of you, and you all
*  described something of a similar experience.
*  Well, Jonah, what is the prosecution doing here
*  by having Michael Cohen so openly embrace this role
*  as basically Trump's number one jerk?
*  This general role that Michael Cohen is describing
*  will become the specific role he played in what prosecutors
*  say is the crime here.
*  So they're laying a couple of things down.
*  One is that Cohen reported directly to Trump, no one else,
*  and that it was extremely important to Michael Cohen
*  to make sure that Trump knew every little thing he
*  did on Trump's behalf, not only because Trump actually
*  asked to be kept in the loop in that way, which he did,
*  Cohen says, but also because Michael Cohen himself
*  wanted credit from Trump.
*  I mean, it's hard to exaggerate the way
*  that Cohen saw Trump in these days.
*  He idolized him.
*  He wanted his praise, his adoration.
*  As he was on the stand describing those days almost
*  as his glory days, he was quoting Trump saying
*  Trump would say, this was fantastic.
*  This was great.
*  Nice job, Michael.
*  And that is important.
*  Why exactly?
*  Because Cohen is going to testify about interactions
*  only he had with Trump.
*  And those interactions are going to be, prosecutors say,
*  the beginning of a criminal conspiracy that led
*  to criminally false documents.
*  And so if jurors can understand why
*  Cohen was motivated to check in with Trump,
*  not just Trump with Cohen, but Cohen with Trump,
*  and it's this innocent, almost embarrassing reason
*  that he wanted this praise, it may
*  be that they're more liable to find Cohen credible.
*  Got it.
*  They're establishing a track record, a dynamic,
*  and a motivation in which Cohen doesn't do anything
*  without telling Trump because Cohen is so desperate
*  for his idol to love him back and praise him
*  for every little thing he does.
*  Exactly.
*  I started to think of this as a modus operandi argument,
*  an MO argument.
*  Yes, we'll get to the specifics, but we're
*  talking about how Cohen works with Trump.
*  That's his MO.
*  And the reason that prosecutors need that
*  is to show this is what they did all the time.
*  This was their habit.
*  And so when it came to forming a conspiracy
*  to suppress negative news about Trump during the 2016 election,
*  that wasn't so far off what Cohen had always
*  done for Donald Trump.
*  OK, so with all that in mind, Jonah,
*  take us to the testimony from Cohen
*  that prosecutors hope will, in the eyes of the jury,
*  prove that Trump committed a crime here.
*  Prosecutors say that the impetus for the Stormy Daniels payoff
*  was the release of the Access Hollywood tape.
*  Right, this tape in which Trump is recorded
*  saying that he can do pretty much anything he wants to women.
*  Washington Post breaks the story.
*  It's considered a turning point in the campaign
*  because it is so utterly damning with women and anybody else who
*  thinks that this behavior is completely unbecoming of precedent.
*  Right, and Cohen, sitting on the stand, actually takes us into that moment
*  and attributes a reaction to Trump to the Access Hollywood tape.
*  And what's Trump's reaction?
*  Cohen, from the stand, recalls Trump's reaction saying,
*  this is a disaster, total disaster.
*  Women are going to hate me.
*  And he says the word's disaster, and he says women will hate him,
*  according to Cohen's testimony.
*  And fat prosecutors say that reaction from Trump
*  and from the campaign is what provides the impetus for Cohen
*  to go ahead and make that hush money payment to Stormy Daniels.
*  But first, he has to wait for Trump's approval.
*  So he strings Daniels and her team along,
*  as we've already seen in this trial from Daniels' team.
*  Now Cohen is testifying about intentionally trying to delay,
*  even using the Yom Kippur holiday, the Jewish holiday,
*  as an excuse for not getting back to Daniels' team.
*  And Trump, Cohen says from the stand, has this conversation
*  with some of his advisors, Trump's advisors.
*  And they say, in essence, what are you doing, man?
*  You're a billionaire.
*  This is $130,000.
*  This right here could be the election.
*  Just do it, just pay her.
*  Right, don't take the risk that amid all this fallout,
*  in the final days of the campaign from the Access Hollywood
*  video, that Stormy Daniels is going
*  to go tell the world that you had an extramarital affair
*  with her, allegedly.
*  Like, that is not a tolerable risk.
*  Right, and the way Cohen tells it, this affects Trump,
*  and he's influenced.
*  And so what Trump was told, just do it,
*  becomes the directive to Michael Cohen.
*  Just do it, just pay her.
*  We'll pay you back, but just pay her and make this go away.
*  So Cohen does it.
*  He does what he's told.
*  He makes the payment to Stormy Daniels.
*  And he does it in this really almost humiliating way.
*  He uses his home.
*  He takes out a line of credit on his house.
*  He gets the $130,000 he needs for the Daniels'
*  payment that way.
*  And so he's putting something really personal on the line
*  here, and this actually relates, obviously,
*  to his testimony earlier.
*  Right, his unbelievable loyalty to Trump.
*  They're almost fusion together, that he would do something
*  like this, do something that concerns his home
*  and his family, and take $130,000 out of that
*  for Trump to suppress this story of having had sex
*  with a porn star.
*  So Daniels gets paid $130,000, and then, as everyone knows,
*  Trump wins the election.
*  So if this was a scheme to suppress that story,
*  it seems to have worked.
*  I mean, she doesn't tell the story, he wins the election.
*  We can't know the counterfactual.
*  We can't know what would have happened
*  if the story came out, but we do know that it didn't,
*  and we do know that he wins.
*  Right.
*  So everything worked.
*  You would think Trump would be very happy about this,
*  but he and his chief financial officer at the time,
*  Allen Weisselberg, and the other people
*  at Trump Organization have a little bit of a problem here,
*  because they have to deal with a very grouchy,
*  increasingly kind of salty, unreimbursed Michael Cohen,
*  who knows this story about Trump,
*  who actually paid to have this story removed,
*  but is getting upset, both because he knows
*  he's not getting a job in the administration,
*  which he says he had wanted,
*  and he got a very small bonus that year.
*  It's the little things.
*  To some extent, yes, but also Cohen has paid $130,000
*  out of his own pocket and not being reimbursed.
*  You're gonna give this guy a small bonus this year,
*  of all years.
*  So at this point, we're in January 2017.
*  So this all is happening,
*  not only while Trump is president-elect,
*  but while he's about to be inaugurated.
*  He's about to be the president of the United States.
*  And then, once he is president,
*  once he's in the White House, who should come for a visit,
*  but Michael Cohen.
*  And he goes to the Oval Office,
*  and he and Trump have this similar conversation,
*  according to Cohen on the witness stand,
*  where again, Trump affirms that he has knowledge
*  of the reimbursement plan, and in fact, even tells Cohen,
*  the president of the United States in the Oval Office,
*  tells Michael Cohen, you're gonna be receiving checks.
*  And prosecutors say that those checks
*  are some of the first of the false documents
*  for which Trump is eventually charged.
*  So this is good for the prosecution, right?
*  This is their case, this is what they want to happen.
*  These are the all important conversations for them.
*  And now they have them, Cohen has said them,
*  the jury has heard them.
*  But at the same time, this is exactly the risk too,
*  because yes, there's a lot to back up
*  that Cohen was in the room with Trump,
*  but only Cohen can tell you what was said.
*  Right, there's no recordings.
*  There's no recordings of these particular conversations.
*  It's just Cohen, it's just his memory.
*  You have to believe him.
*  You have to believe him, and as the defense has said,
*  and has even the prosecution has acknowledged,
*  Cohen is a liar, Cohen is a felon.
*  Cohen's a bully.
*  Cohen is a bully, and he's a guy who really has an ax
*  to grind against Trump, who once would do anything for Trump,
*  and now almost prosecutors and defense have acknowledged,
*  would do anything against Trump,
*  who is Trump's kind of sworn enemy here.
*  And so the prosecutors know
*  that while they're still questioning Michael Cohen,
*  they need to deal with his motivations,
*  with his liabilities, with all that mess,
*  before the defense can try to use them
*  to undermine everything that Michael Cohen has just said.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Jonah, what's the story
*  story that the prosecution has Michael Cohen tell proactively about how he becomes Trump's
*  sworn enemy, about their falling out.
*  You had said that Cohen was increasingly disillusioned with Trump even before Trump became president
*  because of the small bonus and not getting a job in the White House.
*  But in Cohen's telling on the stand, when does the true breakdown actually come?
*  Yeah, so Cohen takes the jury blow by blow through this, but I won't do that here.
*  We'll go straight to 2018.
*  The news of the Stormy Daniels payment breaks.
*  Cohen is in big trouble here because a lot of law enforcement agencies are like, hey,
*  this looks a hell of a lot like a crime.
*  Soon enough, Cohen is in a hotel room being raided by the FBI.
*  His legal fees are up in the air.
*  This often comes back to money.
*  And he loses his direct connection to Donald Trump.
*  Instead, Trump hires Rudy Giuliani and this new guy, Robert Costello, starts coming up
*  to Cohen and offering him legal advice and offering him this back channel to the White
*  House.
*  Cohen to Costello to Giuliani to Trump.
*  That's very different from only having one boss in the whole world and that's a direct
*  line to Donald Trump.
*  That's exactly right.
*  That must have been very painful for Cohen.
*  There's so many motivations going on here.
*  There's that closeness that we know that he treasured.
*  There's the money issue that keeps coming up.
*  And so long story short, as this pressure continues to build on Cohen and he continues
*  to feel as if he does not have the loyalty of his former boss, that he's unsupported
*  by his former boss, he breaks and he flips.
*  I am done with the lying.
*  I am done being loyal to President Trump.
*  And not only does he start cooperating with law enforcement, but he starts speaking out
*  publicly.
*  Mr. Trump is a con man.
*  He asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair and to lie about
*  it to his wife, which I did.
*  Telling the same story beginning in 2018 and going on to 2019 and for years now.
*  I am sorry for actively working to hide from you the truth about Mr. Trump when you needed
*  it most.
*  That he is telling in the courtroom right now.
*  I lied for Donald Trump.
*  I bullied for Donald Trump.
*  I committed crimes for Donald Trump.
*  And now I'm not going to anymore.
*  Well how does the prosecution confront the obvious question, which is, is Michael Cohen
*  so angry and so betrayed by Trump that what's really going on here is not necessarily a
*  vivid recollection of truth, but an effort to just destroy Trump?
*  So trials are an exercise in kind of competitive storytelling, prosecution story versus defense
*  story.
*  And the prosecution has a reasonable story about Michael Cohen.
*  And that's what they're going to use here.
*  Cohen is an emotional person.
*  We've heard that in the context of his anger, but there's all kinds of different emotions
*  going on there, including just this real vulnerability.
*  And so at the end of their questioning, prosecutors ask him about his emotional state toward the
*  Trump organization and Donald Trump himself now.
*  And Cohen says that he doesn't regret having worked for Trump at the organization.
*  He says, I had some interesting, great times.
*  But he does say that he regrets having done the things for Trump that he did, lying and
*  bullying people on Trump's behalf.
*  And what he says, and prosecutors are hoping to answer your question that this is kind
*  of mega compelling, that in order to keep the loyalty of Trump and express his own loyalty,
*  Cohen violated his moral compass and he suffered the penalty for doing so.
*  And so did his family.
*  But at the same time, this is all in the eye of the beholder.
*  Even when he's telling this big emotional story and prosecutors are asking him to do
*  it, who knows what these jurors are making of Michael Cohen?
*  Either they believe him, they find this sympathetic.
*  They think, oh, yes, this sounds exactly like how Trump works based on everything else I've
*  seen at this trial.
*  Or they're saying, once a liar, always a liar.
*  How can I believe this guy?
*  I don't care about his emotions, frankly, because he's a thug and a bully, as I've heard
*  not only from him himself, but from other people.
*  I'm going to ignore this.
*  I don't believe it.
*  Okay.
*  So let's turn to what happens once the prosecution ends its questioning of Michael Cohen, hopes
*  to God in their minds that the jury does find him credible.
*  And Trump's defense lawyers start taking a whack at him and obviously seeking to ensure
*  that the jury does not find him credible.
*  So I should just start by explaining that I'm talking to you on Wednesday.
*  The cross-examination has only lasted about a half day and we've still got a full day
*  of cross to go.
*  Got it.
*  So there's a lot of Michael Cohen being grilled by Donald Trump's defense lawyers that we
*  have not yet seen.
*  Okay.
*  So we're only covering a small amount.
*  What ends up happening?
*  So Todd Blanche is Trump's lead trial lawyer here and he walks to the lectern and Cohen
*  has just given this emotional testimony about vulnerability and loyalty and this and that.
*  And Todd Blanche asked Michael Cohen about a TikTok he made.
*  A video on TikTok.
*  A video on TikTok.
*  And what he says is, after the trial started in this case, you went on TikTok and called
*  me a crying little shit, didn't you?
*  And the jurors sit up in their chairs, as you might imagine, and the entire mood in
*  the courtroom changes.
*  Mr. Emotional over here, Mr. Michael Cohen, is now being called what he says he was for
*  Trump.
*  A person who slings insults.
*  Someone who maybe his behavior hasn't changed quite so much as he said it had.
*  This was a really interesting decision by Blanche.
*  This is a remarkable moment.
*  And Blanche does it one more time.
*  He brings up another insult actually slung at Blanche and his co-counsel, Susan Necklis.
*  And then something happens to interrupt them, which is that the judge calls them to the
*  bench.
*  Now, we didn't know in the moment what the judge had said, but we get transcripts afterwards
*  so we can hear things that the jury doesn't hear.
*  And what we saw in the transcript is that the judge in this moment, after Blanche asked
*  these two explosive questions, turns to Todd Blanche in private and says, why are you making
*  this about yourself?
*  A question that is asked of me constantly.
*  But the answer is what?
*  Well, Blanche doesn't really have that much of an answer.
*  And this is a bit of a momentum killer, I think.
*  Blanche goes back to the lectern, but now he's trying to balance between angry judge,
*  angry client, Michael Cohen, jurors.
*  There's a lot of elements to keep in your mind.
*  His stride has been broken.
*  It has and he seems a little less sure of himself.
*  The questions are a little less sure handed.
*  And he seems to lose momentum right at the top of cross.
*  And then suddenly it gets very confusing what he's trying to do.
*  He's throwing a lot at the wall.
*  He seems to be arguing that Cohen is a liar, Cohen is a bully, Cohen is trying to make
*  money off Trump.
*  And these are all salient points and they could make for a coherent story.
*  But that story isn't really being told.
*  Instead we're getting bits of pieces of it and it's all over the map.
*  I think what Blanche was trying to do was tell a story that wasn't so dissimilar to
*  the one that prosecutors told.
*  He was saying that Cohen, yes, had been very loyal to Trump and yes, had broken with Trump,
*  but did not have this kind of change of heart and change of personality and in fact was
*  still a liar and still a bully and was lying and manipulating the evidence and doing everything
*  he could to get back at this man who he used to love and who he felt betrayed by.
*  And that sounds like a pretty good story, but he wasn't telling it clearly enough to
*  my ear to really land in the room.
*  He was confusing.
*  He got into these kind of petty back and forths with Cohen, who by the way, we had expected
*  to be really out of control during cross, but in fact stayed composed and kind of gave
*  the same answers over and over again saying, yes, sir.
*  Or when Blanche brought up an insult that Cohen had used, Cohen would say, that sounds
*  like something I would say, kind of defanging like, yes, you know, I said that, but who
*  cares?
*  It's not a big deal.
*  And Todd Blanche almost seems as if he's trying to win back control and he starts asking questions
*  that are a little harder to follow.
*  For example, he's talking about these different investigations in which Cohen talked to the
*  this prosecutor or that prosecutor, and it's all just very complex and somewhat abstruse
*  or obscure.
*  And I'm watching the jurors and they're glancing around the room, one yawns.
*  And so these are about the most visible signs we can see of what the jurors are thinking.
*  And what we're seeing is that they don't look keyed into this all important question and
*  answer session.
*  And so by the end of the afternoon on Tuesday, it's hot in the courtroom, it's dry, it's
*  confusing.
*  And it's not really clear that Todd Blanche accomplished what he was trying to accomplish.
*  Although, as you said before, we're only a couple hours into cross examination, but first
*  impressions matter.
*  This is a crucial witness.
*  And from what you're saying, it sounds like this first stab at discrediting Michael Cohen
*  kind of peters out.
*  I think that's exactly right.
*  But I also want to emphasize the first part of what you said again.
*  This was two hours.
*  It was the afternoon.
*  It was after a long day of trial in which Todd Blanche is taking furious notes about
*  Cohen's direct testimony.
*  Right.
*  Now, Todd Blanche, like those of us who are covering the trial, has a whole day, a whole
*  day to study Cohen's testimony, to prepare for it, and to come back on Thursday with
*  the whole day ahead of him and a coherent strategy that he hopes will discredit Cohen
*  and win him the trial with this all important witness.
*  So just to end here, Jonah, I want to understand where you think we are.
*  In our last check-in, you had said that in the parlance of the legal world, the evidence
*  was coming in well for the prosecution, by which you seem to mean the prosecution was
*  hitting its marks.
*  There wasn't a lot of confusion about what it was trying to do, and it seemed to be doing
*  what it was trying to do.
*  And without treading into the land of prediction, which is totally pointless and counterproductive
*  when we're talking about a jury trial, I wonder if you think it's fair to say that so far
*  this trial is going reasonably well for the Manhattan district attorney.
*  And the reason I ask that is because there were always these pretty big questions around
*  this case.
*  Why was this the first criminal case against Trump?
*  A hush money trial, business falsifications?
*  This is a guy who, in many people's eyes, inspired an insurrection at the Capitol.
*  And this is the case?
*  To some people, it felt like a confusing anti-climax.
*  And so I'm curious if, as the reporter covering this in the room day in and day out, you're
*  finding that so far this just does seem like a relatively well-executed strong case.
*  Prosecutors can only bring the case that they have in front of them.
*  So Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, doesn't have the January 6th case.
*  He doesn't have that.
*  He has this.
*  And this case, I think maybe more than any of the other cases in which Trump is charged,
*  is a case that really exists in the eye of the beholder.
*  And Michael Cohen is its perfect avatar in that sense.
*  Michael Cohen may seem credible, and he may seem utterly unbelievable.
*  So as we look toward the end of this trial, this is the prosecution's last witness.
*  We don't know what kind of case, if any, the defense will put on.
*  We could very much see this case go to a jury very, very soon.
*  It's worth refocusing on these 12 jurors and their relationship with Michael Cohen.
*  Michael Cohen has told a compelling story, a compelling story.
*  But again, he is the only witness who can link Trump to the crimes that prosecutors
*  here in Manhattan have alleged.
*  And so as the trial is very, very close to ending, Michael Cohen is exactly what we
*  expected.
*  This big, prominent, important star witness and probably the biggest risk that prosecutors
*  have taken.
*  Well, Jonah, until next time, thank you very much.
*  Of course.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Donald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020.
*  Since then, he hadn't shown up for debate.
*  Now he's acting like he wants to debate me again.
*  Well, make my day, pal.
*  I'll even do it twice.
*  After exchanging online talks, President Biden and Donald Trump agreed to two general election
*  debates to be held in late June and early September.
*  The debates will bypass the nonpartisan organization that has managed presidential debates for
*  decades, but whose rules have frustrated both campaigns.
*  As a result, the Biden Trump debates will play by their own rules.
*  The first debate, for instance, will not include a live audience as presidential debates typically
*  do, and will establish a high bar for including a third party candidate like Robert F. Kennedy
*  Jr.
*  In a statement, Kennedy wrote that Trump and Biden want to exclude him from the debates
*  because, quote, they are afraid I would win.
*  Today's episode was produced by Eric Krupke, Stella Tan, and Will Reed.
*  It was edited by Devin Taylor, contains original music by Pat McCusker, Marion Lozano, and
*  Alicia Baitoop, and was engineered by Alyssa Moxley.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Lanthoork of Wonderly.
*  That's it for the Daily.
*  I'm Michael Bobar.
*  See you tomorrow.
