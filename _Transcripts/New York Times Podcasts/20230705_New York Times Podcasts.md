# How MrBeast Became the Willy Wonka of YouTube
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vfBLFIxOVE)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Katrin Benhold, and this is The Daily.
*  Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast, has become a sensation on YouTube, with ostentatious
*  and sometimes absurd acts of altruism that go viral.
*  Today, journalist Max Reed on the rise of YouTube's most popular star, and what it tells us about
*  the platform and its users.
*  It's Wednesday, July 5th.
*  Max, hello.
*  Hi.
*  So, I had a strange experience earlier this year.
*  I have three kids, and they're very into watching videos on YouTube.
*  In full disclosure, my husband works at YouTube, so I'm probably the only one in my family
*  who doesn't obsessively watch YouTube videos.
*  But one day a few months ago, my teenage daughter showed me this video.
*  And this video works during a thousand people's blindness.
*  It's going to be crazy.
*  It was called 1000 Blind People See for the First Time.
*  Oh my God.
*  I see everybody.
*  In this video, this goofy looking young guy with the scraggly beard explains how he pays
*  for eye surgery for 1000 people.
*  And we're just getting started.
*  We still have 980 lives left to change.
*  And I was like, what's going on here?
*  Who's this guy?
*  Thank you, Mr. Beast.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  And my daughter said, you haven't heard about Mr. Beast?
*  Yeah, that's kind of the perfect video to get an introduction to Mr. Beast, isn't it?
*  It gets all of the hallmarks of a Mr. Beast production.
*  There's a lot of money being thrown around.
*  There's very high production values.
*  There's this goofy, enthusiastic sort of adolescent tone.
*  And there's this altruism at the core of it, that the focus of the video is giving the
*  money away in this extremely extravagant and colorful way.
*  And a combination of those qualities has turned this guy into the most popular single YouTuber
*  on the platform.
*  He has the most subscribed channel on YouTube besides the Bollywood music label T-Series.
*  He recently passed Coco-Mellon, which if you have a toddler, you know very well because
*  it's like a toddler narcotic basically.
*  And the fact that he's passed Coco-Mellon to somebody like me, who has a two and a half
*  year old is maybe the most impressive thing any entertainer has ever done.
*  I mean, it's fascinating because on the face of it, it seems kind of surprising that the
*  most popular guy on YouTube is essentially doing like good stuff.
*  And that's just not what I've thought was popular on the internet these days.
*  I feel like in recent years, we've been talking so much about far-eyed rabbit holes and darkness.
*  So this is different.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's done it, as you say, by sort of being very different from what I think people imagine
*  YouTubers to be like.
*  If we imagine a kind of Jake or Logan Paul, these sort of extremely good-looking drama
*  queens who live in McMansions in Los Angeles and start fights with each other, or PewDiePie,
*  the Swedish gamer who is probably most famous for making what he claimed were ironic anti-Semitic
*  pranks.
*  MrBeast, he hasn't done any of that stuff.
*  He's mostly spent his time putting on these enormous stunts and giving away a lot of money
*  in prizes and sometimes just to random people on the street.
*  So Max, for those of us who are, you know, older than 14, what's this deal?
*  Well, MrBeast's real name is Jimmy Donaldson, and he's a 25-year-old from Greenville, North
*  Carolina.
*  You know, I've been covering YouTube for 10 years.
*  I'm a tech journalist by trade, and I've been watching him rise over the last four or five
*  years into being this behemoth figure on the platform.
*  But he started in a much more humble place.
*  How's it going, guys?
*  It's been a while since I've done a commentary or, you know, even made a video for that matter,
*  but I just...
*  He began making videos in about 2012, and at the beginning he was just making what are
*  called Let's Play videos.
*  This is going to be a video about the top 10 worst guns in Call of Duty history.
*  And real quick, the gameplay you're watching is nothing special.
*  It actually sucks, but, you know...
*  Where he would play a video game, usually Call of Duty, and commentate on his own performance
*  and upload videos like that.
*  So my number 10 worst gun in Call of Duty history is the PM9 from Modern Warfare 3.
*  And I think a lot of people can agree with that.
*  This is a really common YouTube genre.
*  And at the same time, he was studying the masters, so to speak.
*  He talks about having spent all of his time in high school just watching popular YouTube
*  videos and looking at how they titled their videos, looking at what kinds of thumbnail
*  images they used, and trying to kind of reverse engineer a science of YouTube success.
*  He decided not to go to college over his mom's wishes in order to really devote himself to
*  this.
*  And he put in the hours.
*  He garnered a small subscriber base early on, but he didn't really take off for four
*  or five years.
*  And in all that time, he was waking up, obsessing, watching, tweaking his own videos, thinking
*  about what his next videos were, and trying to outdo himself.
*  I'm about to count to a hundred thousand.
*  The first video that went truly viral was one where he counted to 100,000.
*  You don't believe me?
*  Just watch this video.
*  And recorded it, edited it, and uploaded to YouTube.
*  Hang on, he counted to a hundred thousand?
*  Yeah, just sitting in front of his computer in his room, he counted from one to a hundred
*  thousand.
*  9995, 4996, 4997, 4998.
*  And people watched it.
*  People loved it.
*  It went viral.
*  99,999, 100,000.
*  What am I doing with my life?
*  And I think for him, it was an object lesson in the value of putting in an effort and letting
*  viewers see how much effort you put in.
*  And it's really interesting to me, you know, as somebody who's been a journalist online
*  for a long time, the conventional wisdom is that volume is the most important thing if
*  you're producing content.
*  If you're making YouTube videos, just make as many YouTube videos as you can, and surely
*  one of them will go viral and you'll gain a lot of subscribers.
*  But what Mr. Beast seems to have learned is that if you spend a lot of time and focus
*  a lot of energy on doing one video that makes it very clear how much time you spent, how
*  much effort you put into it, sometimes how much physical pain and exhaustion you had
*  to endure, that that's something that YouTube viewers connect with.
*  So what are some examples of the videos he makes after figuring this out?
*  What's up, guys?
*  I'm going to be attempting to set the world record for the longest Uber ride ever.
*  So he rides in an Uber from North Carolina to California, which is 2256 miles.
*  So he just agreed to do it.
*  This is going to be the man taking us from North Carolina to California.
*  Thank you.
*  You're going to give me a viral video.
*  Keeping in the theme of cars.
*  Why did I purchase Every Fan in my City to try to push a car?
*  He buys a thousand fans and tries to push a car using all those fans.
*  It's number one, it's Everyday Bro, it's Everyday Bro, it's Everyday Bro, it's Everyday Bro.
*  He watches the YouTube video, It's Everyday Bro, which is a legendarily atrocious rap
*  video by his fellow YouTube star, Jake Paul, for 10 hours straight, which is frankly a
*  daring stunt for anybody who wants to save their brain cells.
*  I have a headache.
*  I'm tired of hearing it.
*  Oh gosh, that was miserable.
*  I've got a piece.
*  I mean, he more or less invents and certainly perfects a style of video that has come to
*  be known as the junk lord videos.
*  So called because they involve a lot of really extravagant waste that creates a lot of junk,
*  like say a hundred fans that did not successfully push a car anywhere.
*  And the idea behind the junk lord video is exactly what we've been talking about.
*  That if you spend a lot of money on a huge stunt, the more ridiculous the better, the
*  sillier, the funnier, the more extravagant the better.
*  You can bring in a lot of viewers and this becomes a really dominant style of YouTube
*  up there with the let's play videos that we were talking about before.
*  This is a pit of slime.
*  You guys will get in it.
*  I don't care which one of you it is.
*  Last one of you guys to leave this slime gets 20 grand.
*  Chris start us off.
*  And a lot of his junk lord videos involve giving money away.
*  Whether that means a really extravagant contest where there's a prize winner at the end who
*  gets 10 or 50 or a hundred thousand dollars.
*  Or sometimes it means just arbitrarily handing money to people on the street.
*  So you don't really have much.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I'm a YouTuber.
*  I mean, you can see the camera.
*  So I'm just the series where I just, you know, be nice and just give people some help.
*  So if you want to take it, it's about ten thousand dollars.
*  For example, he wraps ten thousand dollars in cash in a bundle and he hands it to a homeless
*  man who's panhandling in a median.
*  Anything you want to say?
*  These guys are the best.
*  These guys are unbelievable.
*  This is crazy.
*  And he does a short, awkward little interview with this guy and they give him a ride somewhere.
*  And he finds that this is a really successful video.
*  You know, if you have ten thousand dollars, what he's realizing is you don't need to necessarily
*  spend the ten thousand dollars on slime to put in a barrel that you then have to bathe
*  in in order to make the views.
*  You can just take the literal ten thousand dollars and give it to somebody who needs
*  it and viewers will respond very similarly.
*  So he starts doing more videos where he's just giving away money like that.
*  Do you accept tips in cash?
*  Yes.
*  Here you go, man.
*  Thanks for driving us.
*  Are you serious?
*  Yeah.
*  Yes, sir.
*  He tips ten thousand dollars to Uber drivers.
*  He gives away ten thousand dollars in tips to waitresses.
*  He hands the deed of a house to a Domino's delivery guy who's delivering a pizza to that
*  house.
*  Here is the key.
*  It is yours.
*  Seriously.
*  No strings, no catch, no nothing.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  But like these amounts you're talking about, these are not insignificant amount of money.
*  Where does that money come from?
*  Yeah.
*  So at the beginning, he's mostly getting direct sponsorships, you know, software companies
*  who have some money to burn and want to get their products in front of people who watch
*  YouTube will just give him, say, ten thousand dollars and he can use it to fund a video
*  of some kind.
*  But the other important thing to understand about YouTube is that it's a platform where
*  it's really easy to monetize your followers, by which I mean, if you have a certain number
*  of subscribers, you can flip a button in your settings that allows you to earn about 50
*  of all the advertising revenue that YouTube is getting from the videos you make.
*  So if your videos are routinely getting hundreds of millions of views, you are earning a lot
*  of money with every video you put up.
*  And something that Mr. Beast is very explicit about and something that I think is very attractive
*  about him to his fans is that he puts the money that he earns with every video into
*  the next video.
*  He sort of makes an implicit promise that the money that he makes when you watch his
*  videos are going to go to an even bigger, more extravagant giveaway or contest or a
*  stunt in the next video.
*  We just hit 100 million subscribers and from the bottom of my heart, thank you everyone
*  that subscribed.
*  So when he hit 100 million subscribers, which was last year, he bought a private island
*  in the Bahamas.
*  So I brought 100 of my subscribers to compete in four extreme challenges.
*  This one standing wins this island.
*  And then invited a bunch of subscribers to do survivor style competition in order to
*  win the island from him.
*  See the smoke on that?
*  How is that not lighting?
*  This is an easy guy.
*  He's not giving it away.
*  The production values are very high.
*  It's very fun.
*  Do none of you want an island?
*  Try it.
*  Then start a fire faster.
*  And it's hard not to think as you watch it that there's a suggestion that maybe if you
*  subscribe to MrBeast, you might someday be a recipient of his generosity.
*  Congratulations!
*  Thank you!
*  I can totally see how my daughter would want to be called up like that.
*  Yeah, I call him the Willy Wonka of YouTube because a huge portion of his appeal is that
*  he's both entertaining and also potentially able to transform your life as a viewer.
*  He could reach down and throw you $10,000 to offer you a check to quit your job on the
*  spot.
*  And so to some extent, the popularity, it's almost like entering a lottery or something.
*  You join in with MrBeast and maybe you too will become the object of his charity.
*  So the money comes because it's compelling to millions of viewers to give away money,
*  which then lets him give away more money.
*  It's kind of like the cycle that feeds itself, it seems.
*  Yeah, it's a flywheel.
*  He makes money from each video that then goes into another video, both the production but
*  also the value of the cash prize or gift, which then brings in more viewers.
*  So he grows at the same time that the charity grows.
*  And for a lot of viewers, this is like a beautiful, wonderful thing to watch.
*  So by the end of last year, just a few months after that island video, he's passing PewDiePie
*  until that point, the biggest YouTuber.
*  So now he's riding high at 163 million subscribers.
*  It's incredible, 163 million.
*  I mean, that's like twice as many people as live in Germany, which is where I'm from.
*  Right.
*  And that's the context in which the video that your daughter showed you of MrBeast paying
*  for all these cataract surgeries was released in February.
*  And this video vaulted him even outside the containment of YouTube.
*  This video enters Twitter, enters mainstream media, enters Facebook, all these other platforms,
*  and all these people who hadn't really even encountered MrBeast encounter him for the
*  first time.
*  And all of a sudden, this kind of flywheel of growth and charity that made a lot of sense
*  in the context of YouTube was being questioned by people for whom it felt somewhat different.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Okay, Max.
*  So what happens when this MrBeast video breaks out of YouTube and starts to get some more
*  mainstream attention?
*  Yeah, when the blind people see for the first time video came out in February, I think there
*  was a huge sense of bafflement that this strange, wonka-esque, goofy, maybe a bit shallow
*  video had gone so viral.
*  It's hard to do this on a podcast, but I feel like I have to describe in just a few words
*  the thumbnail to this video.
*  And it's this very obviously Photoshopped image of a grinning MrBeast with his hand
*  on the shoulder of a presumably post-surgical child whose eyes are brimming with tears,
*  with a kind of shocked expression on his face that to me reads almost like shocked with
*  horror.
*  There's some unseen horror in the distance that he's looking at.
*  The whole thing, it reads as cheap, it reads as cheesy, it reads as manipulative.
*  And the video is not as bad as the thumbnail, but there is something a little bit icky about
*  it.
*  I'm quoting another YouTuber who acknowledged that there is something icky about the idea
*  of putting a chiron at the bottom of the video that counts the number of blind people who
*  are being saved as though they're like objectives in a video game.
*  And I think that for a lot of people, that kind of filmmaking feels antithetical to the
*  generosity or charity.
*  So the criticism in a way is that this is all a little cynical and exploitative.
*  That basically he's in it for the views, he doesn't really care about these people he's
*  helping.
*  Yeah, and I think if you watch the video, the criticism is not exactly baseless.
*  It's notable that in a video where he is paying for a relatively cheap but totally transformative
*  surgery, he never really questions why these thousand people who he's giving it to weren't
*  able to access it in the first place.
*  What the structural or political reasons are that they couldn't get cataract surgery.
*  In the course of my reporting, I talked to one of the subjects in the video, a kid named
*  Jeremiah Howard, who's been blind in one eye since he was about five or six.
*  And Jeremiah told me what I found to be an incredibly compelling story about essentially
*  being unable to find the help that he needed that between applying to the Social Security
*  Administration for help, trying to raise money from his classmates, he just couldn't come
*  up with the money.
*  So what people are objecting to is that even though Mr. Beast might be helping Jeremiah,
*  he isn't really doing anything to change the system that made it impossible for Jeremiah
*  to get the simple surgery in the first place.
*  Yeah, though I should also say, when I put this to Jeremiah and asked him about the kinds
*  of criticism that Mr. Beast was facing, Jeremiah essentially said to me, well, have any of
*  those people paid for my eye surgery?
*  The bottom line is he paid for the surgery.
*  And to the extent that Mr. Beast has a very explicit model in which he has very successful
*  videos that make a lot of money, and that money then goes to charity or goes to prizes,
*  if he started making 45 minute videos about the history of healthcare in the United States,
*  it seems very unlikely that those are going to get the same kind of viewers that a punchy
*  10 minute feel good video will.
*  And so for his flywheel to keep moving, he really does need to make it as direct to viewers
*  as possible.
*  So Max, what can we say about his motivation?
*  Well, I don't know what's in Mr. Beast's heart, and he didn't agree to an interview, so I
*  haven't spoken with him.
*  But I have to say that I started reporting this piece with a skeptical frame of mind,
*  as somebody who did find the blind people video somewhat alienating.
*  And in the end, I think I was mostly won over, at least to the position that of all the things
*  that anybody could be watching on YouTube, and of all the people who could be making
*  YouTube videos, this was really not so bad at the end.
*  And one thing that helped me get past my hang ups, to the extent that I've gotten past them,
*  because I don't want to give Mr. Beast a blank check or anything, was speaking with teenagers
*  and 20-somethings who had watched Mr. Beast for years, and finding them, if not annoyed,
*  at least sort of baffled at the question, isn't he just doing this for views?
*  Isn't this just a cynical exercise?
*  A lot of these people, again, people for whom YouTube was the main source of entertainment
*  for most of their youth, the kinds of tactics that Mr. Beast is undertaking in videos like
*  1000 Blind People See for the First Time, are the cost of doing business, that there
*  was no point in making videos that weren't sentimental, manipulative, eye-catching, icky,
*  so to speak, and that if he stopped doing that, if he stopped using those strategies,
*  then he might as well just give up entirely.
*  But I think there's something else going on too, where Mr. Beast is really good at speaking
*  sort of directly to his audience about their own role in his channel.
*  And I think the fact that Mr. Beast says to them...
*  From now until the end of the year, every single time someone subscribes, I will give
*  away 10 cents.
*  Every time you watch this channel, you are putting 10 cents in the pocket of someone
*  else, which he says on some of his specifically philanthropic videos.
*  100% of all the ad revenue, brand deals, and merch sales from this channel, Beast Philanthropy,
*  will go into this food pantry.
*  Allows them to feel empowered, allows them to feel like they're doing good, and sort
*  of gives them a sense that by doing this thing that they already love, which is to say watching
*  YouTube, they're also participating in a kind of movement themselves, that they're
*  able to act on the world.
*  Every view on this channel is literally putting food in people's mouths, like this.
*  Which especially if you're 12 or 13 and you don't have a ton of money or a ton of agency,
*  is probably a pretty attractive proposition to you.
*  It's kind of funny because it's such a vague sense of doing good, right?
*  A lot of charities are actually aligned with some sort of political point of view or ideology,
*  but it doesn't seem like Mr. Beast is.
*  And so I'm curious, Max, has he aligned himself with any political faction given this huge
*  platform that he clearly has and the amount of money that he's given away?
*  No, and I think this is one of the more interesting things about him.
*  I think we all have heard plenty of stories about YouTube as a site for right-wing radicalization,
*  but I certainly wouldn't place Mr. Beast on the right wing by any means.
*  While I was reporting this story, one of his close friends who appears in a bunch of videos
*  announced that they were undergoing hormone replacement therapy, and Mr. Beast has been
*  nothing but quite vocally, openly supportive and protective of his friend, which is sad
*  to say not something you would necessarily expect from a popular YouTuber.
*  At the same time, he's not standing up against or presenting himself as an alternative to
*  more controversial YouTubers like PewDiePie.
*  He still appears on the channels of YouTubers who, if they themselves are not explicitly
*  right-wing, are, let's say, right-wing coded in a culture war that is perhaps too complicated
*  to go into in detail here.
*  Do you think it's actually a selling point for Mr. Beast that he can't be categorized
*  politically in the same way?
*  He's kind of all over the place, so in a way he's nowhere, and I don't know, maybe that
*  helps his appeal.
*  I think so.
*  I think it's important to keep in mind that the bulk of Mr. Beast's viewers are adolescents,
*  young teenagers, people who are not necessarily extremely politically sophisticated, who are
*  not particularly interested in joining in a culture war that aligns with electoral politics,
*  and for whom pretty simple and straightforward charities like planting trees, cleaning up
*  the ocean, giving cataract surgery to people who need it, are much more appealing than
*  more explicitly political causes.
*  So Max, you were won over, and clearly so are many of the young people that are subscribed
*  to this channel, but do you think there's any danger in making people feel like they
*  are actually doing good by simply watching Mr. Beast's videos?
*  It kind of reminds me of a lot of kids liking a cause on Facebook but not actually going
*  to the march.
*  Yeah, I think one difference we can say in Mr. Beast's defense, I suppose, is that there
*  actually is money being generated by them watching videos, and that money is going to
*  charity.
*  So it's, I suppose, on the grand spectrum of do-gooding, slightly better than merely
*  liking the cause on Facebook.
*  But this style of charity or altruism is pretty new.
*  We don't really know where it goes from here, and we don't really know what happens to people
*  for whom Mr. Beast is their first engagement with charitable giving or with activism in
*  general.
*  What we do know is that what Mr. Beast is doing is clearly working.
*  So in a way, I wonder, doesn't that seem kind of counter-cultural, that this is what young
*  people are going crazy over when everything we thought about the internet was sort of
*  pointing in the opposite direction?
*  Yeah, I mean, what I find actually quite funny about it is that it feels a little bit retro
*  to me, that all kinds of stuff on YouTube that I would see in the 2010s just didn't
*  make any sense to me.
*  This is like admitting that I'm...
*  That you were born before 1990.
*  Yeah.
*  But to say, I've never really loved watching other people play video games.
*  But clearly, some people really love that.
*  But when I watch Mr. Beast's videos, I don't necessarily find myself confused.
*  They remind me in a really direct way of TV I watched when I was a kid, of American Gladiator,
*  Double Dare, Extreme Home Makeover.
*  You can go even further than that and say they're like Queen for a Day.
*  It's like very classic, straightforward, basic cable, local news, feel-good programming.
*  And I think that part of what's happening is that as YouTube gets bigger and bigger,
*  as the platform keeps expanding, its audience is becoming more...
*  The only word I can think to say is normal.
*  The audience is becoming more like the audience for broadcast television was in 1995.
*  And I think that means content becomes a little bit broader.
*  It becomes a little bit more feel-good.
*  It becomes a little bit more sentimental in a way that YouTubers just weren't in the
*  earlier days of the platform when, even though it was very, very big, it still didn't have
*  a kind of mass American audience.
*  I mean, I feel like he's cracked the formula, right?
*  And that it seems like the formula is universal themes, universal games, universal humor,
*  kind of a common denominator people go for.
*  Do you think this portends good things for the internet broadly?
*  I think so many people are worried about the internet.
*  So many parents like myself are worried about the internet and what it's doing to our children.
*  But is this a harbinger of good things to come?
*  I suppose I felt...
*  The only way I can gauge this question is telling you how depressed I feel after I finish
*  any given story that I write about the internet.
*  And I felt, I would say, less depressed at the end of this story than I have about many
*  different stories that I've written over the years.
*  There's a lot to criticize about MrBeast and a lot to criticize about the sort of model
*  of charity and viewership that he's promoting.
*  But I feel like the bottom line is, could be worse.
*  The thing that I do keep in mind though is that MrBeast's rise from a 12-year-old video
*  gaming North Carolinian kid to the biggest YouTuber of all time happened over the course
*  of 10 years.
*  And that is a blink in the eye, so to speak.
*  Right now it seems like maybe we can be optimistic about the future of the internet.
*  But we also know how quickly these companies and platforms shift, how quickly they rise
*  and they fall.
*  So all we can really do is wait and see, I suppose.
*  So I guess if my daughter asks me how to become a successful YouTuber, I should just tell
*  her go for generosity and decency.
*  Morality sells.
*  This is what I should tell her.
*  It turns out that being a successful YouTuber is also the same as being a pretty good human
*  being, I guess.
*  Thank you very much, Max.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Tuesday, eight people were wounded in a car ramming attack in Tel Aviv that Israeli
*  authorities described as an act of terrorism.
*  It came as Israel mounted one of its largest military operations in the occupied West Bank
*  in years.
*  At least 11 Palestinians were killed and 120 injured in a series of Israeli drone strikes
*  and ground raids in Jenin, a densely populated refugee camp.
*  The events raised fears of tit-for-tat violence in the region six months after the most right-wing
*  government in Israeli history took power, vowing to root out Palestinian militants and
*  expand Jewish settlements on occupied territory.
*  And Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is heading to China today for four days of difficult
*  talks aimed at easing tensions between the world's two biggest economies.
*  Her visit comes at a time when relations between the United States and China have been strained
*  over a wide range of economic and security issues.
*  One of the most contentious issues is expected to be the renminbi, China's currency, which
*  has been falling considerably against the dollar and is threatening to hurt U.S. exports.
