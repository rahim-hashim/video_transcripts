*  Hi, I'm Ezra Marcus. I'm a contributing writer to the New York Times magazine.
*  This week's Sunday read is my profile of a Bay Area rapper who goes by the name of
*  Berner. He's a guy you've probably never heard of. Who, in all fairness, is not the
*  most accomplished rapper. But he somehow always ends up alongside Jay-Z and Kanye on these
*  lists of the five richest rappers in the world. That's because Berner is the CEO of Cookies,
*  one of the largest, most well-known legal cannabis brands in the United States. Maybe the best known.
*  And what makes Berner fascinating is that in a way he embodies the current state of the cannabis
*  industry as a whole. On the one side, a weed industry that's legal and yet completely hamstrung
*  by regulation. And on the other, a black market that's still thriving and even facilitated by the
*  supply from the legal side. A couple decades ago, Berner was working at a medical marijuana
*  dispensary while also dealing weed on the street. Weed was on the cusp of becoming recreationally
*  legal in California. And Berner saw an opportunity. He noticed that when he draw colorful labels for
*  weed strains, they'd sell better. Branding is really important, he figured. And so he started using
*  rap music as a marketing tool. He made songs with famous rappers like Wiz Khalifa, who embody
*  cannabis as a lifestyle. And he built his brand around a novel strain of weed called Girl Scout Cookies.
*  He would give out three quarter pounds of it to dealers to spread awareness. It turned Berner
*  into an iconic figure. By the 2010s, Berner was selling t-shirts and hoodies with a cookies logo on
*  them. Then, after cannabis was legalized, he partnered with investors who transformed cookies
*  into a real company. But cookies is different from his other large corporate cannabis companies,
*  which give off a kind of safe, almost medical consumer product kind of vibe. Cookies trades on
*  the romance of the black market and the subcultural cache of illegal weed. It resonates with heavy
*  cannabis consumers like nothing else. There are cookies stores all over the world.
*  Anytime a new store opens, it's like this subcultural event akin to juggalos or deadheads.
*  Cookies' obsessives will travel and line up around the block to meet Berner and buy Cookies merch.
*  None of that would be possible without Berner's brilliant marketing.
*  I went to visit Berner at his compound in Marin County, California. It's this giant,
*  nondescript warehouse on the outside. But inside, it's like an upscale we work office. But with all
*  these stoner touches, there's trippy, hunter-ass tombs and art and hallucinogenic scenes everywhere,
*  and tons of rooms displaying different projects. And then there's a bunch of guys sort of
*  hanging out there. They're smoking, Berner's rolling joints. He's showing me big bags of weed
*  strains he's developing. It's not your classic business school background. It's almost the exact
*  opposite. And so, even though he is, in many ways, the archetypal stoner. Berner clearly has a
*  sophisticated, keen business mind. So, here's my article. How do you make a weed empire?
*  Sell it like streetwear. Read by James Patrick Cronin. Our audio producer today is Jack
*  Desadora. And the music that you'll hear was written and performed by Aaron Esposito.
*  The closest thing to a bat signal for stoners is the blue lettering of the Cookies logo.
*  When a new storefront comes to a strip mall or a downtown shopping district,
*  fans flock to grand opening parties, drawn by a love of the brand. One based on more than its
*  reputation for selling extremely potent weed. Until recently, the company was largely a West Coast
*  phenomenon. But as marijuana legalization spread east, so did Cookies. A little over a year after
*  recreational sales became legal in New Jersey, the chain opened a new location in a bland outdoor
*  mall in Harrison. It's aesthetic landing somewhere in the startup meets streetwear zone between
*  Apple and Kiff. I walked over to a large circular table laden with dozens of jars each containing
*  a different strain. There were longtime Cookies' saw warts like Gary Payton, a collaboration with
*  the NBA legend, and new variants with names like Mexican Flan and Dirty Muffler.
*  There I met Nicola Pavlovich, a genial salesman wearing a flamingo-patterned bucket hat at
*  top-long hair, canvas moccasins, and a shirt covered in psychedelic flowers. Pavlovich, 31,
*  is an aspiring stand-up comic who began smoking to help with anxiety and found himself down what
*  he called the canisore rabbit hole, reading forum posts about exotic hybrogenetics and terpene
*  This expertise eventually took him to Cookies, where his role is to match customers with the ideal
*  strain for their lifestyles. I asked what he would suggest for a freelance reporter who might
*  want to in live in dull afternoons at home in front of the computer. Pavlovich recommended a strain
*  called Laughing Gas. This is like renting a Ferrari in Miami and going on a straight highway,
*  he told me, and just slowly pressing the gas. All around us were neatly labeled $70
*  jars of weed and $300 bongs laser etched with the Cookies logo. And of course, Hoodies. Cookies clothing
*  plays a key role in both the brand's origin story and its current marketing strategy. The brand
*  predates any legal marijuana regime when Cookies was strictly a black market concern,
*  Hoodies and hat sales allowed it to gain a foothold above ground. And the soft goods give buyers
*  a way to signal something specific to the outside world. I smoke lots of weed but in the cool
*  Wiz Khalifa way, not the lame suburban mom way. People often compare Cookies with the streetwear
*  brand Supreme. That's accurate in one very literal sense. They each sell a lot of hats.
*  And in other more subjective ones, they share a pension for collaboration-based marketing.
*  Their appeal to mainstream audiences is tied up with their implied connections to elicit subcultures
*  and they've each been expanding rapidly in recent years thanks to infusions of venture capital.
*  Harrison was the 64th Cookies outlet to open in the United States. There are also retail
*  locations in Israel, Thailand and Canada. All of it is inextricable from burner. The stage name
*  of Gilbert Milum 40, the company's co-founder and chief executive who spent two decades as a rapper
*  with a sideline as a dealer or as a dealer with a sideline as a rapper. The two roles have long
*  propped each other up to the point that Milum is estimated by some to be a centimillionaire.
*  Though any estimate of his net worth depends largely on how much he think Cookies is worth.
*  He claimed in a 2019 podcast interview to have rejected an $800 million offer for the company.
*  A 2022 report from the journalist Zach O'Malley Greenberg placed his worth at $410 million.
*  Forbes meanwhile valued Cookies at a more conservative $150 million when it wrote about Milum in
*  2022. Any of these figures would make him one of the wealthiest rappers in the world,
*  without him having ever released a hit record or even one that most rap fans have heard of.
*  Many of these estimates were made early on in the Biden administration. When states like New
*  Jersey and Montana were moving to legalize and there was still hope that Democratic control of
*  the executive branch might lead to quick decriminalization or rescheduling of the drug at the federal level.
*  O'Malley Greenberg recently reassessed Milum's net worth at $250 million.
*  What happened instead was a national patchwork of chaos. Every state's laws and agricultural
*  profile are different, making it extremely hard for national brands to operate within the rules
*  and easy for bad actors to take advantage. Several cannabis sources I spoke to said that it has
*  long been an open secret that major legal companies are flooding the black market with legally
*  grown cannabis. Look no farther than the vast quantities of weed for sale in New York City at
*  unlicensed stores. The legal market has been cannibalized by the black market, said Josh
*  Burman, a cannabis veteran who has known Milum for about a decade and previously worked as Cookies
*  Grover and processor in Washington state. The same people who are selling in stores are the same
*  people controlling the black market and they're picking and choosing which lane makes the most sense.
*  Cookies, more than most players in the cannabis business, trades on its origins in the pre-legalization days.
*  It is an empire Milum built on a series of risky moves, first by entering the cannabis black market
*  and then by turning his participation in it into the cornerstone of a recognizable brand,
*  long before legalization made that safe. The core of Milum's appeal is the charismatic narrative
*  of his rise from black market hustler to mogul. Get the tension between the street and the nascent
*  legal cannabis industry, the latter still struggling to distance itself from the former,
*  has brought with it some thorny problems for his company and the industry at large.
*  As he seeks to capitalize on the legalization blitz, Milum is facing scrutiny from regulators,
*  along with a number of lawsuits from corporate rivals as well as former investors and business partners.
*  He could emerge on the other side on top of a booming industry, or one that's collapsing
*  under the weight of its own ambition. Milum recently finished construction on something he calls
*  the compound, which occupies much of a block in an office park in Marin County. There is no public
*  signage, reflective windows are the only indication that the work being done within might be anything
*  less traditional than accounting. Milum picked the location in part as a safety precaution,
*  because marijuana remains illegal at the federal level, legal weed companies are largely shut
*  out of the federally regulated banking system, turning stores into cash heavy targets for robberies.
*  Before this, Milum told me his arrangement was less secure. He recalls employees texting him pictures
*  of piles of cash on a table. I'm like, you guys have no business around all that cash by yourselves
*  in San Francisco, he said. After all, he was no longer a black market dealer and neither were his
*  colleagues. They were white collar cannabis executives with backgrounds and business. Even in
*  the suburbs, he remains security conscious, and he suggested to me that the compound was well
*  protected. God forbid someone were to kick in this door right now, we've got a game plan,
*  and you're going to hear some loud ass rounds go off, he said. Through a representative, cookies
*  said that this is not representative of his position on the topic of security and personal protection.
*  The compound was only a few weeks old when I visited in late June. Milum led me on a tour through
*  the massive building where some rooms remained under construction. He led me past a room with a bank
*  of monitors where designers worked on product labels to a room with large shelves stacked with
*  jars of weed, new strains in development. Cookies R&D process involves Milum's smoking buds that
*  emerge from its grow lab and seeing if he likes them. It's the best job in the world, he said.
*  The cavernous space currently containing not much more than a sportscar beneath the tarp
*  will eventually turn into a sound stage. Milum wants to start a streaming service called
*  Couch Locked Network, where a hulkator destoners with cooking shows and crime documentaries,
*  like Vice, he said, if they hadn't fumbled the back. As we walked through the corridors,
*  the vision grew more expansive. He told me at one point that he hopes after he's gone,
*  a hologram version of him will be able to introduce new cookies, strains, locked in cold storage by
*  present day Milum over the course of the next century. We made our way to the kitchen where a private
*  chef was making lunch, Japanese chicken curry, for half a dozen guys sitting around a table.
*  As we ate, a nurse came in and drew Milum's blood. Two years ago, he received a diagnosis.
*  Stage three colon cancer. Soon after that he said he decided to build the compound.
*  That's everything I've worked for. That's 49 albums, all the years of touring. That's 20 years of
*  work right there, he said. It was a bet on the future existence of both the company and himself.
*  In March of last year following chemo and surgery, he announced that he was cancer-free.
*  I want to see cookies through to the end, he said. I'm doubling down on cookies.
*  After lunch, Milum and I walked upstairs to a large boardroom with skylight-studded ceilings.
*  A long table surrounded by herm and Miller chairs sat in the middle, surrounded by stoner
*  Sheet Gart, trippy optical illusions, a framed Jimmy Hendrix poster, a life-size sculpture of
*  Hunter S. Thompson. Milum said he liked to sit there and feel his empire humming around him.
*  He lit a blunt and unfurled the narrative of his life, beginning with his first job in the
*  cannabis industry as an employee at the hemp center, a medical dispensary in San Francisco's
*  Richmond district. That was 2002. Eight years earlier, California became the first state in the
*  country to legalize medical marijuana. And though the hemp center was fully above board, it was in
*  another sense a complete fiction. Anyone could get a prescription from medical marijuana from a doctor
*  advertising in the back pages of the alt weeklies and a complaint about, say, chronic pain.
*  Milum's responsibilities included writing the names of strains on note cards.
*  I just would be high, doodling and coloring my **** and making it look tight, he said.
*  Customers, he noticed, would gravitate toward the signs he drew. A light bulb went off.
*  Branding actually really matters. In 2007, Milum began releasing a steady stream of music,
*  depicting the life of a smoker and dealer in granular detail. He aggressively pursued
*  collaborations with Bay Area Legends like the Jacque and Messy Marff, says Camel Jacobel,
*  a Bay Area event producer who is known Milum since the hemp center days.
*  As a rapper, Milum wasn't exactly reinventing the wheel, but he cleverly bootstrapped a double
*  barreled career path, selling weed allowed him to finance albums with hot artists and
*  establish street bonafides. And the music promoted his dealing and status as an early public
*  facing weed mogul. This dynamic continues today. He's positioned it where his music in his career
*  just fuels the success of his cannabis company and vice versa, Jacque O'Bell said.
*  They kind of ping pong back and forth off each other.
*  During the mid-Auts, Milum heard about a reclusive Bay Area grower named Les Jai Chang, aka Jai,
*  or Jiga, who had managed to produce some unique flavors. They started working together, and in 2008,
*  Jai brought him a fateful strain. There's no seeds, the bud structure, the smell, the taste,
*  the high, Milum recalls. Everything about it, I was like, this is it, it's out of here.
*  Jai thought that it tasted like a thin mint, which gave the strain its name. Girl Scout cookies.
*  To spread the word, Milum says he reached out to the biggest dealers he knew and gave
*  them each a quarter pound of Girl Scout cookies to hand out to customers as a sample. Smokers loved
*  the strain, but when they asked for more, their dealers were dry. That's what broke Cookies hard,
*  Milum says. The limited supply created a hype around it, he says, just like Jordans.
*  In 2011, Milum capitalized on the strain's notoriety by starting a brand called Cookies SF,
*  which sold streetwear and eventually smokers tackle items like rolling trays.
*  Milum began to hang out and record with rap's stoner icons,
*  Wiz Khalifa, Snoop Dogg, Currency, Be Real from Cypress Hill. He says he never asked rappers to
*  mention his strains, but soon enough Girl Scout cookies began showing up in rap lyrics.
*  Wiz Khalifa signed Milum to his label, Taylor Gang Entertainment, and invited him on tour.
*  Milum wasn't allowed to perform though, so during other artists' sets he would walk through the
*  crowd, slanging trays and jars directly to fans, like a hot dog or peanut guy. He says he would
*  clear $3,000 in merch sales a day. The other artists made fun of him for not chasing after
*  groupies and enjoying himself, but when the tour was in Texas, Milum showed up wearing a Rolex he
*  bought from the legendary Houston Jouler Johnny Dang. The joke said his expense stopped.
*  Throughout his rise, Milum was an active participant in the black market, with all that it entailed.
*  It was scary, he said. It was like Ozark. The risk of robbery was ever present. He sometimes acted
*  as a middleman, connecting dealers with growers in Northern California, and people on either side
*  could resort to violence of a deal when South. A path out of the black market appeared on the
*  horizon as legalization began to spread across the country, starting with Colorado voting in 2012
*  to legalize recreational marijuana sales. Legal weed was coming to America, and Milum wanted in.
*  He had name recognition and access to a steady supply of new strains through Jai,
*  what he did not have was a functioning company. The largest cannabis companies in the country today
*  are known as MSOs, or multi-state operators. They build out independent supply chains in every
*  state they sell weed in. These are typically buttoned up, relatively faceless corporations,
*  often publicly traded with market caps and the hundreds of millions. These are companies with
*  names like Cresco Labs, Curileef, True Leaf, and Terrace End. Many of them emerged on the East
*  Coast and Midwest in states that granted only a handful of commercial licenses. Without competition,
*  they didn't need to build a brand and could focus on scale and infrastructure.
*  Parker Burling, the president of Cookies, likes to point out that the company came out of a
*  completely different environment. Highly competitive markets emerged on the West Coast,
*  where medical use thrived for more than a decade before recreational legalizations swept the
*  country. Most of the MSOs, I think, are companies first trying to build brands, and then we were a brand
*  first trying to build a company around the brand. Burling says, from the beginning, Burling and
*  Milum knew Cookies couldn't compete with the MSOs on their own terms, they were just too big,
*  and because it remains illegal at the federal level, weed cannot be transported over state lines.
*  Every state, meanwhile, built its own regulatory framework for cannabis,
*  each with a bespoke tangle of tax rates and limits on how it can be grown, advertised, and packaged.
*  This makes for a fiendishly difficult industry to compete in at a national scale.
*  Why would you ever set up 20 manufacturing facilities across the US, Burling asked? That's insane,
*  but that's what the cannabis industry is today. To circumvent this problem,
*  Milum and Burling found their way to a strategy similar to fast food franchising. Broadly,
*  Cookies finds people who already have permits and partners with them,
*  allowing them to use the brand name and genetics so they can grow the strains and operate the stores.
*  I look at it as like a league, Milum said, we're not like an NFL team, we're not a player,
*  we're not the coach, we're elite, we're putting people in position, we allow people to play ball.
*  This strategy has allowed for rapid expansion. The first Cookies store opened in Los Angeles in 2018.
*  The company has since opened 69 more.
*  Milum, who has 2 million followers on Instagram, claims that his celebrity gives him a marketing
*  advantage over the MSOs. I can get off with one Instagram post, what one of these companies can
*  get off with a $4 million billboard campaign, he said. And I'm shadow band. And perhaps,
*  unlike any other chief executive in America, he's constantly touring. He spent this past summer
*  opening for Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa and venues across the country, each performance a
*  marketing opportunity for Cookies. In early August, the high school reunion tour stopped at a
*  large arena in Hormdell, New Jersey. Milum played early as the crowd was still filing in.
*  The LED screen on stage behind him was emblazoned with a QR code that led to the company's landing
*  page, where prospective buyers can scroll through strains like Bernie Hanna Butter and Congo
*  Kashmir. He hyped the opening of the upcoming store in Harrison, produced a case of joints,
*  tossed one to a woman a few rows back and led the crowd in a chant of,
*  hit it, hit it, until she took a big puff. This goofy, stoner act, a Lides, Milum's history is
*  a sophisticated black market operator. Take the stunt he pulled when he gave Girl Scout Cookies to
*  dealers. He brags that the MSOs would never be in the position to even put a QP, a quarter pound,
*  in someone like that's hands, he said. I understand the business of weed. Not just the legal
*  business, not just the black market business. They play a role with each other. If it resonates on
*  the streets, it will resonate in the legal market. If people from the streets will go in and buy weed
*  in the legal market, you're doing something damn right. Milum isn't entirely unique in the way he
*  is moved between these two worlds. The black and legal markets continue to exist both in concert
*  and competition with each other. Even as more states continue to legalize the drug, taxes and limits
*  on transporting cannabis keep prices high, allowing street dealers to compete effectively on price
*  with licensed sellers. In many states, the halting rollout of licensing has unleashed unregulated
*  gray markets that threaten to engulf the legal markets before they can flourish. Over the past
*  couple of years, pot dubiously branded as cookies flooded stores across New York state.
*  None of that was legal. Cookies did not have the permits to sell cannabis products in the state,
*  and indeed, the company said it was not doing so. But it could be real cookies product purchased
*  wholesale in California and shipped cross-country by third-party distributors, or some totally
*  unrelated weed repackaged and counterfeit cookies bags, which are readily available on websites
*  like Alibaba. Through a representative, cookies said that it is likely the most knocked off and
*  counterfeited cannabis brand in the world. Cookies stores continue to open around the country,
*  and Milum says that the future is bright for the company. But over the past year, it has been
*  dragged into several legal disputes involving investors, business partners and corporate rivals,
*  who claimed a pattern of unscrupulous business practices by Milum, Burling, and other executives.
*  Two groups of shareholders have claimed that Burling compels Cookies' licensors to use a construction
*  company called GCI, at which Burling's brother is an executive, and that the company charges
*  exorbitant prices. Cookies and Burling have denied these allegations. Investors also accused
*  the company of balanced sheet chicanery. Cookies, a complaint said, burned through cash and ran out
*  of money while also making payments to companies in which Milum and Burling have a financial interest.
*  Burling has said these claims are demonstrably false. Another suit targets the company,
*  as well as several others, for unfair business practices, arguing that its involvement in the
*  production of a category of products known as hemp derived in toxicating cannabinoids effectively
*  undermines the entire legal cannabis market. Cookies denied the claims. The lead plaintiff of the suit
*  is March and Ash, the retail arm of a California cannabis company, and offers a window into the
*  vexed state of the legal weed business. Hemp derived in toxicants exist in a regulatory gray area,
*  based on a creative interpretation of the 2018 Farm Bill, which legalized hemp-based substances
*  like CBD, as long as they contained a very low level of THC. But if you infuse legal hemp with
*  synthetic compounds like THCO, THCP, and HHC, all psychoactive substances very similar to THC
*  that are not scheduled by the Drug Enforcement Administration, the product can be sold as a legal
*  derivative of hemp, even though it has powerful psychoactive properties matching or even surpassing
*  normal weed. On top of that, it is cheap to produce, not subject to the high taxes on cannabis
*  products in recreational use states, and can be sold in jurisdictions where prohibitions still
*  exists. Mylam's career as a rapper has been used against him in court by at least one investor who
*  transcribed his lyrics in a filing to paint him as a real-life gangster. Mylam has in turn used
*  music to respond to his complainants. A promotional video that came out in May of last year for a song
*  called One Shot Kill features Mylam sitting at the head of a table in a boardroom staring down
*  men in suits whose reflections in the polished conference table are wearing ski masks. Mylam declined
*  to comment on the lawsuits and has called them an effort to usurp his control of the business.
*  It's worth noting that there is nothing surprising about a startup's facing legal challenges
*  from competitors and disgruntled investors during its tumultuous growth phase. Still, the litigation
*  may signal that what has buoyed cookies so far, a strong brand built on associations with hip hop
*  and legacy drug culture may not be enough to weather the storm rocking the industry at large.
*  Cannabis stocks are down, black markets remain robust, even as regulatory blunders and red tape
*  continue to hamstring would be legal operators. High taxes and a lack of viable banking keep margins thin.
*  Every operator has struggled during this period, said Jesse Redmond, a cannabis sector analyst at
*  Water Tower Research. I literally do not know of an exception of someone that's killing it during
*  this period. Some are doing better, some are down 50%, some are down 99%. As legal weed proliferates
*  across the country, many storefronts have adopted a sterile corporate aesthetic while others lean
*  into puril graphics of, say, red-eyed, rick-and-morty smoking blunts. Cookies tries to distance itself from
*  this mundane reality by associating itself with the romance of the black market. At the mid-August
*  store opening, a line snaked through the store. People waited to meet Branson Belchi, a legendary
*  figure in cannabis lore and among the most famous pot dealers of all time. In the 1990s, Branson
*  cultivated a following among New York's rising hip hop royalty. His name shows up in dozens of
*  songs by Biggie Smalls, Red Man, Cameron and others. Yet at the peak of his fame, he wasn't giving
*  interviews or making public appearances. He was closer to an urban legend than a celebrity.
*  Now he was signing t-shirts and posing for selfies in a gleaming New Jersey storefront, as 20
*  some things in fancy sneakers perused cookies wears and chatted while the DJ in the corner
*  played throwback rap hits. Branson was there as part of a promotional push for a new strain he
*  released with cookies last year called Harlem's Finest. It comes in a bag with a golden triangle
*  emblazoned on the front, a nod to the unusual triangular bags associated with Branson in the 90s.
*  Now cookies is allowing Branson to finally step out of the shadows, but that doesn't mean the
*  shadows are gone or that the faltering legal industry will ever be able to dispel them.
*  Branson was notably ambivalent about his newfound status as an elder statesman.
*  I'm not really that enthused about being exposed that kind of way, because I've been
*  discreet about what I've done over a period of time he told me. A world in which people can go
*  to the ATM and buy an eighth from an unlicensed bodega he told me was hardly rid of illicit operators.
*  If anything it's a world that would increase the pressure on them.
*  If I was still on the corner he said nodding at the immaculate store around us.
*  This would be my competition.
