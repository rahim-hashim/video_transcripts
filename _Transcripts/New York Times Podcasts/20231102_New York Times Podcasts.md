# The Many Missed Warnings Before Maine’s Mass Shooting
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cTyF8t48cE)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro.
*  This is a daily.
*  Today, the mass shooting that occurred in Maine last week, killing 18 people, was the
*  country's deadliest of the year.
*  It may also have been one of the most avoidable.
*  My colleague Nicholas Bogauro's on why so many warnings about the suspected gunman from
*  so many people failed to stop it.
*  It's Thursday, November 2nd.
*  Nick, in the days since this awful mass shooting in Maine, you have been trying to reconstruct
*  the warning signs that something was very wrong with the suspected shooter.
*  So tell us about what you have been finding.
*  Yeah.
*  So in the days after this attack, we've received a bunch of documents that show a series of
*  troubling interactions with the suspect whose name is Robert Card.
*  He's a 40 year old army reservist.
*  And the documents show that these warnings concerned his deteriorating mental health,
*  rising paranoia and anger.
*  And they came from pretty much every part of his life.
*  But as we now know, none of those warnings prevented this mass shooting.
*  Well, Nick, where should we start in the story of those warnings?
*  You mentioned that they go back many months.
*  I mean, the first time when the local police are really made aware that this guy is a concern
*  is about five months ago in May when his ex-wife and teenage son go to a school resource officer.
*  And the school resource officer calls down a sheriff's deputy to speak with the family.
*  And in that interview, the teenage son and the ex-wife say that he has started to hear
*  He started to be increasingly paranoid and angry.
*  They also note he has collected about 10 to 15 guns that he kept at a relative's house
*  and brought them back to his.
*  So they're going to the police and saying that he has access to a large number of firearms.
*  I mean, they were very worried about him.
*  And I think what they also were struggling with is not understanding where to get him
*  and what kind of intervention might lead him to be more aggressive and more isolated.
*  So what's the response from the local police after the family has this conversation with them?
*  The deputy has this conversation with the ex-wife and the teenage son and seems to talk to them at length
*  and learn a lot about Card's behavior and his career in the Army Reserves.
*  He was in the Army Reserves for 20 plus years at that point.
*  And the deputy and the ex-wife basically decide that the best place to get help is probably through the Army Reserve.
*  It's people who have known him for a long time.
*  It's people he interacts with regularly.
*  And maybe they have a more formal system of getting someone like this help.
*  So the deputy goes back and makes a call to the Army Reserve base and learns from them.
*  And this is in May that they've been aware of his declining mental health at the Army Reserve base
*  and that they already know that something is wrong.
*  So at this point, they have two really important data points.
*  They have family members deeply concerned that this man is not well and has guns.
*  And they now know that his place of work, the Army Reserves, is also very concerned about him.
*  So what do the police do with all this information?
*  They decide, I think, largely to leave it in the Army Reserves' hands.
*  Hmm. So the police come up with a kind of informal solution to this problem, which is work with the Army Reserves.
*  I think that's right.
*  OK. So what happens next?
*  So the next thing we know that happens is in July.
*  Card travels with his reserve unit to West Point, New York, for an annual training exercise.
*  And there's a very concerning incident that takes place.
*  They're all hanging out together at a motel, and he starts accusing them of calling him a pedophile.
*  This is one of his paranoid delusions that comes up repeatedly.
*  He shoves one at one point, and everyone is just freaked out.
*  And eventually they call for a supervisor who comes down and tries to speak with Card in his motel room.
*  Card tries to slam the door on him.
*  So the supervisor decides that Card needs medical attention.
*  He takes him to a hospital, and he later writes about a concerning interaction during that time
*  where Card was just staring at him for four hours or through him without blinking.
*  And at the hospital, they ultimately decide that he needs further treatment
*  and that he should be moved to a psychiatric center, which he is.
*  Hmm. And what do we know about the kind of treatment he receives there?
*  We know next to nothing except the amount of time he spent there, which was 14 days.
*  And after two weeks, he left and that his supervisor in the reserve say that they're not sure he ever sought treatment again.
*  OK, so this is clearly a very delicate moment in the story.
*  He's very unwell.
*  Everyone's aware of it. He's just come out of a hospital.
*  What happens to him?
*  The next thing we know is that in the days after he was released from this psychiatric center,
*  he tries to pick up a silencer for a gun that he had bought.
*  Interestingly, on that form to pick that up, it asks if he has had a mental health treatment or been committed for mental health treatment.
*  And he actually answers yes.
*  Wow. He's up front and says he has.
*  And so the gun shop owner says, I can't give this to you.
*  And he's, from what we heard, very nice about that and says, OK, no problem, I'll figure that out and never comes back.
*  After that, things just go downhill.
*  In mid-September, he is riding in a car with a longtime friend and fellow reservist and starts talking in very concerning ways.
*  He's saying that he's upset with people calling him a pedophile, but he also starts talking about carrying out a mass shooting.
*  He starts talking about shooting up places, including his Army Reserve base and other establishments.
*  And at one point, his friend who's in the car says something like, you need to stop talking like that or you're going to get in trouble.
*  And Card actually punches him in the face.
*  So his friend gets out of the car, makes his way home and then contacts their superiors in the reserve and says he's worried about his friend.
*  And what do the reserves do in response to that?
*  So this initiates basically, I think, the most intense intervention that we've seen at this point.
*  The reserves reach out to the sheriff's office in Sagahawk County where Card lived.
*  So the same sheriff's office, right, Nick, that the son and ex-wife have been talking to.
*  That's right. So this sheriff's office knew about concerns back in May, and now they're hearing from the Army Reserve in September that things have escalated.
*  So the reserve says, we'd like you guys to go check on this guy, basically perform a welfare check.
*  So the sheriff sergeant goes back to Card's address and there are indications that he might be home.
*  So the sheriff sergeant calls for backup. They try to make contact with Card.
*  They go up to his door. They think they might hear him moving around inside, but he won't come to the door.
*  And so at that point, they decide because they're in a sort of, as they describe it,
*  a disadvantageous position, fearing that he's armed and unwell.
*  They decide to leave him alone at that point.
*  Huh. That's kind of a confounding place for police to land because at this point,
*  this sheriff's office knows very well that multiple people on multiple occasions have determined that this man is a threat.
*  Sounds like the police officers outside the house themselves think he's a threat.
*  So they just leave, you're saying, even though all signs point to someone whose mental state has gotten worse and worse and worse,
*  and who's now explicitly making threats of shooting people.
*  Right. They do leave the home and the sheriff sergeant goes back and starts to reach back out to Card's family and his reserve base.
*  I think at this point, he's trying to learn a little bit more about what might be going on.
*  So the sheriff sergeant reaches out to an Army Reserve captain who knows Card and the captain says he thinks that trying to force a contact is a bad idea.
*  He actually recommends to the sheriff's office that they just leave him alone.
*  And he says it's maybe just best to let Card have time to himself for a bit.
*  Wow.
*  At that point, the sheriff sergeant calls Card's brother and the brother says that he will try to take Card's guns away.
*  He says that they have a way to secure the weapons and he's going to work with their dad to try to make sure that Card doesn't have any access to his guns.
*  And that's where the sheriff's office leaves it.
*  And, you know, by mid-September, they've never made contact with Card himself.
*  The sheriff's office never met with him and they never do.
*  And then in October, he buys more guns legally and then within days, he goes to a bar and a bowling alley in Lewiston, Maine and opens fire.
*  And he kills 18 people and wounds 13 more.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Nick, the layers of warnings that you have discovered in your reporting and outlined in the first half of our conversation are breathtaking.
*  And yet none of that stopped this man from either buying guns or being forced to give up the guns that he had.
*  And I'm emphasizing that because even within the very emotional gun control debate that's always raging in this country,
*  lawmakers from both parties have generally agreed that there's a need for ways to take guns from people who pose a threat, mostly because of their mental health.
*  Does Maine have such a law and how did it operate or fail to operate in this case?
*  Yeah, so Maine is an interesting state politically.
*  Its government is controlled by Democrats.
*  It has a democratic governor, but on the issue of guns, it's more complicated.
*  There's a large hunting culture here and in part for that reason, the state has a history of resisting certain gun control laws.
*  But Maine does have a law that went into effect in 2020.
*  That law is called a yellow flag law.
*  And it's basically a compromise.
*  And so the yellow flag law in Maine is different than red flag laws in other states,
*  which allow families to go straight to a court and ask them to take away someone's guns because they're worried about them.
*  In Maine, the yellow flag law requires that the police get the person evaluated by a medical practitioner,
*  and then they take that evaluation and go to a court and then hope that a judge will sign off on them being able to take their weapons away.
*  It adds that extra step of needing to go to a medical practitioner and have an evaluation done.
*  And it also keeps families from being able to directly ask a court to take away someone's guns.
*  Got it. So just to clarify, yellow flag law is a little bit more cumbersome.
*  Sounds like it's also more time consuming, involves more steps and more parties,
*  which is why perhaps you described it as a compromise.
*  It's a little bit more of a watered down version of a red flag law, which makes it a bit easier to take away someone's guns.
*  That's right.
*  OK, so did anyone try to use Maine's yellow flag law in the case of this man?
*  No, there's no indication that anyone tried to use that law.
*  The police could have decided that it was worth taking card to a medical practitioner,
*  trying to get him evaluated and then go to a judge to force him to give up his guns.
*  But no one took that step.
*  I'm really curious what we know about why the police department didn't try to use the yellow flag law,
*  because it clearly exists to solve a situation just like this,
*  and would not force the police to rely on the informal systems that we've been talking about of the family, the Army Reserve.
*  This law is there so that police can go to a judge and say,
*  we've tried this, we tried that, it didn't work.
*  Now we need to use the most formal and forceful intervention possible.
*  Why didn't they do it?
*  We really don't know.
*  The sheriff in Sagahawt County has defended the department's actions and said that
*  they tried to get the family involved to take away the guns,
*  but he really hasn't explained why they didn't use the yellow flag law.
*  What we found out is that this department has never used the yellow flag law since it was passed.
*  In the state, it's been used a total of 81 times, but never by this sheriff's office.
*  That makes me wonder what elected officials in Maine have said about exactly how this played out
*  and what that tells us about whether or not Maine's yellow flag law is working.
*  In the wake of this, elected officials have themselves wondered why the yellow flag law wasn't used.
*  In fact, Maine's senior senator, Susan Collins, who's a Republican,
*  said at a news conference that she thought that the yellow flag law should have been used in this case.
*  And Collins is essentially saying there's a good law in the books that applies to situations exactly like this.
*  And she said that she doesn't understand why it wasn't used in this case.
*  Well, given that the yellow flag law didn't seem to work, are any of the officials in Maine
*  talking about the need for the state's gun laws to change at all?
*  And I'm thinking back, Nick, to something you said earlier in our conversation about the moment
*  that this shooter tried to buy a silencer. You recounted that he had to volunteer that he had
*  been hospitalized. But of course, a determined potential mass shooter might not do that, might
*  not self-report. And of course, he was still able to buy more guns after authorities were made aware
*  of his mental health and after he was hospitalized. I mean, given that, are leaders in Maine asking
*  tough questions about whether a yellow flag law is enough if things need to change?
*  They are. State lawmakers are talking about trying to do something in the wake of this attack.
*  And the governor has said that she wants to take some action, that she wanted to, you know, gather
*  diverse voices from different viewpoints in a room and talk about what could be done. But beyond that,
*  she has really not committed to any kind of gun control legislation in the wake of this attack.
*  Right. And of course, as we all know, state officials, local officials only have so much
*  power given that our gun laws are so grounded in federal law.
*  That's right. And you did have some movement from a member of the federal delegation from Maine,
*  Representative Jared Golden, who's a Democrat from Maine, but has long been a supporter of
*  gun rights and opposed to bans on assault weapons. I have opposed efforts to ban deadly weapons of
*  war like the assault rifle we use to carry out this crime. The time has now come for me to take
*  responsibility for this failure, which is why I now call on the United States Congress to ban
*  assault rifles like the one used by the sick perpetrator of this mass killing in my hometown
*  of Lewis and Maine. He came out at a press conference very emotional and said that he was
*  changing his mind and actually would support banning assault weapons. For the good of my
*  community, I will work with any colleague to get this done in the time that I have left in Congress.
*  He asked Maine voters for forgiveness and said that he had been part of the problem.
*  It was a really stunning reversal that you don't see in politics too much.
*  But of course, Golden is a Democrat in the House, which is controlled by Republicans and
*  Republicans in Congress have expressed virtually zero interest in meaningfully restricting access
*  to guns. That's right. I mean, Susan Collins was actually standing next to Jared Golden when
*  he made this emotional and surprising reversal on assault weapons. And she was asked if she would do
*  the same. Well, first of all, let me say that I think it is more important that we ban very high
*  capacity, manic things. I think that would have more input and more effectiveness.
*  But she declined to go that far. So there in a nutshell, are the limits of Congress's willingness
*  to act on guns. And Nick, I want to end in a way where we began, which is with the reality that
*  so many people in the story of this shooter did the quote unquote, right thing. They spoke up.
*  They tried to do something. They called the police. They did something that when you really
*  think about it is exceptionally difficult. They told someone in law enforcement that a person they
*  care about is a threat, knowing that there would be repercussions. And yet none of it worked,
*  which really does raise the question of whether it's a yellow flag law or even a red flag law.
*  These lonely laws we have on the books are really up to the task. Right. You had a huge number of
*  people in this situation doing one of the hardest things, which is basically calling the authorities
*  on a loved one, being willing to get someone in trouble. His ex-wife, his teenage son, his brother,
*  his sister, his father, and many people in the army reserve with him, including one of his long time
*  friends. All these people wanted him to get help and took that first step to doing so knowing that
*  the repercussions for him might not be good, but that they hoped it would get him the help that he
*  needed. Right. But even after that difficult step, you still have to rely on the people who
*  are in charge of enforcing these laws or doing what they can to do it. Right. And in this case,
*  the law is on the books and the police never tried to use it. So what this tragedy has made clear
*  is that these laws, even if they're on the books and available, are only as good as a police
*  department that's willing to use them. Well, Nick, thank you very much. We appreciate it. Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. After long negotiations between multiple governments,
*  Egypt allowed hundreds of people, including several Americans, to leave Gaza on Wednesday.
*  It was the first wave of what are expected to be thousands of foreign nationals, aid workers,
*  and injured Palestinians to flee Gaza into Egypt. All of them entered Egypt at the Rafa crossing.
*  So far, the only escape route for people trapped in Gaza. Meanwhile, Israel's military said it had
*  broken through Hamas's front lines in northern Gaza, a milestone in its ground operation,
*  which is aimed at destroying Hamas.
