# Affirmative Action for the 1 Percent
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhmmptS0WLQ)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is a daily.
*  Today, a major new study has revealed in staggering ways just how much elite college admissions
*  in the U.S. systematically favor the rich and the super rich. My colleague, David Leonhardt,
*  walks us through the data and explains why the study is fueling calls to abandon long-standing
*  practices like legacy admissions.
*  It's Thursday, July 27th.
*  David, welcome back to the daily.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  David, after the Supreme Court struck down race-based affirmative action in college admissions
*  a few weeks ago, said it was unconstitutional, a lot of people's attention quickly turned
*  to other features of the college admissions process that feel, in a way, like alternative
*  forms of affirmative action and preference, giving people a clear set of advantages in
*  the process.
*  A lot of those people started asking, why aren't we talking about all the ways that
*  college admissions favor the privileged?
*  Yes, and I think that makes sense because college admissions are about to change more
*  than they have in a long time. And so it makes sense for colleges and for society as a whole
*  to ask, well, what features of the current system should remain and what features should
*  change not just affirmative action, but really the whole process.
*  Right. And in the midst of that debate comes a study, and we get a lot of studies in the
*  world of journalism, but this study stood out and it's what we want to talk with you
*  about because it seems to offer a really authoritative, perhaps even the most authoritative ever look
*  at how systems of advantage for those with a lot of advantages already play out in the
*  college admissions process. So David, tell us about this study.
*  I do think it's the clearest look we've gotten behind the scenes at college admissions at
*  these elite schools. And the reason is that it combined admissions records, internal admissions
*  records that several of these colleges gave the researchers access to with tax returns,
*  which gives us hard data on who it is that is applying to these schools. And that allows
*  us in a way that we really haven't before to get a very clear sense of who's applying,
*  who's getting in and who's going. And I've gotten to know this study really well because
*  I've been reporting on these same issues for 20 years and talking to these researchers
*  who are at Harvard and Brown who did it. And I'm actually an informal unpaid advisor to
*  them. I give them thoughts about what are the questions that those of us who aren't
*  economists want answered by data like this. And I really do think after years of writing
*  about this, that this has given me and all of us a better sense of what actually happens
*  inside admissions offices than we've had before.
*  And so with all of this information, what did the researchers who did this study find?
*  What's the headline result?
*  I think the headline result is that we live in an extremely unequal society and college
*  admissions in some ways makes it more unequal. So affluent kids are on average much more
*  qualified than less affluent kids. They have better academic qualifications by any measure,
*  SAT scores, essays. And so, of course, because colleges need to think about which students
*  are prepared to do the work, colleges are going to end up admitting more affluent students
*  for those reasons. And yet, even on top of that, colleges give large advantages in admissions
*  to privileged kids over similarly qualified middle and low income kids. And it's that
*  last thing. It's that idea that when you're looking at two kids who have similar grades,
*  similar test scores, similar academic qualifications, that the affluent kid and particularly the
*  very affluent kid is nonetheless more likely to get in. It's that idea that has caused
*  this study to get so much attention.
*  And David, can you quantify the advantage that this study found? Walk us through some
*  of the numbers that this study produced.
*  So the way that I find most helpful is when they look at a typical class at an Ivy plus
*  college. So those are the eight actual Ivy League schools, plus Duke, the University
*  of Chicago, Stanford and MIT. When you look at the typical class at one of these colleges,
*  about 9% of the students come from the top 1% of the income distribution, meaning they
*  come from families earning more than $600,000 a year and didn't get in because of their
*  academic qualifications. Didn't get in because of their academic qualifications. Or didn't
*  get in solely because their academic qualifications. These are still kids who do extremely well
*  in school. But when you compare them to kids with less money who didn't get in, they don't
*  do better. And in many ways, that is the core finding of the paper.
*  So David, let me make sure I understand this. This study finds that 9% of the college students
*  enrolled in these highly selective elite colleges, in a sense, they don't deserve to have ever
*  been admitted and enrolled based on their qualifications versus any other kid who applied.
*  It's just that they were very, very rich.
*  I think the colleges would push back on that characterization. Colleges would say, no,
*  these students are still extremely qualified. But I also understand why people would look
*  at the study and make that statement. Because if decisions were made based solely on academic
*  qualifications, then 9% of the students at these schools wouldn't be there. And they
*  would be replaced by kids with similar academic qualifications who come from less affluent
*  backgrounds.
*  Right. And there would therefore be greater economic diversity in these colleges.
*  Precisely. And it gets even starker when you look at the richest of the rich. So let's
*  imagine two different applicants with the same academic qualifications, one of whom
*  comes from a family with average income, one of whom comes from a family with income in
*  So imagine a family making about $3 million or more a year. That applicant from the top
*  .1% is more than twice as likely, more than twice as likely to be admitted than a child
*  with the same test scores who comes from a family with an average income.
*  And I think it's that difference, this idea that even after a kid from a middle class
*  or poor background has managed to do as well on the SAT, on these other academic measures,
*  they are still less likely to get in than a kid from a more affluent background. It's
*  that that has people looking at this data and saying, how is that fair?
*  Right. Because what this data establishes is that when it comes to college admissions,
*  there really is a form of affirmative action for the nation's wealthiest kids. Perhaps
*  people suspected that was the case and maybe even acted as if it were the case. But here
*  it is formally and pretty authoritatively documented and established.
*  Yes, that's right.
*  But David, as you've been talking, something's been bothering me, which is that a lot of
*  these elite, highly selective colleges that we've been talking about that this data is
*  drawn from, they say, and they say it very proudly, that they are need blind when it
*  comes to admissions, which means that technically speaking, they are not making admissions decisions
*  based on income at all. In fact, they're supposed to be, as that phrase suggests, blind to it.
*  So how does the study explain this level of advantage for those who are rich when the
*  process is supposed to be blind to their financial background? What does it cite as the causes
*  of it?
*  That's right. It's not wealth directly. It's three other factors that correlate very much
*  with wealth and end up giving wealthy kids an advantage. And the first of those three
*  will be familiar to many people. It's called legacy admissions. It's the idea that if one
*  of the applicant's parents went to the same school, that applicant gets a leg up in the
*  admissions process.
*  Right. It's a formal process. It's not secret. And it's been around for a long time.
*  That's right. It's the official policy of most of these schools.
*  And of course, legacy students almost by definition are likely to be coming from well-off
*  families, not all of them, but many of them. So this policy kind of guarantees a preference
*  for a fair number of rich applicants.
*  That's right. The legacy population skews more affluent than the population as a whole.
*  And this study tells us that legacy applicants get a leg up. Now, it's nuanced. And I think
*  this surprises many people. If you went to one of these schools and looked at the students
*  as this study did, the average legacy student has higher academic qualifications than the
*  average non-legacy student, which again is a reflection of American inequality. Right?
*  If you have a parent who went to one of these schools, you often will have had a better
*  education growing up. And in fact, many of the most qualified students at these schools,
*  the students who do the best, not only in college with grades, but after college with
*  the kind of graduate schools they go to or the jobs they get, they do really, really
*  well. The issue is the colleges also admit a fair number of legacy students who are not
*  there solely because of their academic qualifications, but they're there because of a mix of their
*  academic qualifications and their legacy status. Right. And what the researchers estimate is
*  that about half of the legacy students at these schools wouldn't be there without the legacy
*  advantage. One of the other things that the study shows, and we know this, is that the American
*  elite comes disproportionately from these Ivy plus schools. And so the students who are
*  being admitted are absolutely qualified in terms of a basic sense. Can they do the work? Do
*  they have truly excellent academic outcomes in high school? They do, including the half of
*  legacy students who wouldn't be there without the boost. But the issue is that this is a scarce
*  resource. And what colleges are doing, the researchers argue, is they are concentrating
*  opportunity among people who already get opportunity. Right. And that is something that is
*  worth grappling with. Okay. So that is legacy admissions as a force for reinforcing privilege in
*  the admissions system. What is the next factor that the study cites to explain how these schools
*  are perpetuating privilege?
*  I described the second factor as private school polish. And that's the idea that the students who
*  are applying from private schools, both day schools and boarding schools. So think of Andover, or in
*  New York City, think of Dalton. In Los Angeles, think of Brentwood. What happens is these schools
*  are very good at making their students look good. They're very good at writing teacher
*  recommendations at these schools. They're very good at helping the kids think about their essays.
*  They're very good at helping the kids think about how to package their extracurriculars and to give
*  them really great extracurricular options. So what ends up happening is that when colleges are faced
*  with two applicants, again, let's imagine two with identical academic qualifications, test scores and
*  grades, one of whom comes from a public school and one of whom comes from a private school, the
*  private school applicant is more likely to get in than an equally qualified public school
*  applicant. And just to say something in defense of the admissions officers who are trying to make
*  these decisions sort through thousands of applicants of really insanely qualified teenagers,
*  they understand that private school polish exists, and they think they're able to control for it. But
*  actually, the polish is so effective that they can't or don't fully control for it.
*  Well, David, let me push back against that defense, because I want to better understand it.
*  Admissions officers at these colleges, they know when a kid comes from a private school versus a
*  public school, it says so right on the application, I went to Dalton, I went to Andover. So is
*  this something that an admissions officer could actively seek to compensate for?
*  They can and they do. They just don't do it as effectively as they think they do. So let's think
*  about it this way. The applicant who is coming from a private school has teacher recommendations
*  that really bring out exactly who that student is. They have a guidance council recommendation that
*  makes the kid feel like a full person. It's almost like a newspaper profile. The kid who's coming
*  from public school is working with a guidance counselor who maybe has 150 or 200 kids for whom
*  they have to manage that kid's high school to college process. The recommendation about the
*  public school kid just doesn't pop off the page. Now, your skeptical question is absolutely fair.
*  Could they do it? They could. This study shows they're not.
*  Perhaps the best metaphor for this, as I'm hearing you describe this, is two identical products. We
*  shouldn't think of two identical college applicants as products, but stick with me for a minute.
*  Same quality, same qualifications, but one has a better package. And you're saying these college
*  admissions advisors, they know that they should be thinking about the packaging, but it's so
*  persuasive that they can't unsee it.
*  That's exactly right. And I should say when we talk about private schools, that does not include
*  religious schools, like Catholic schools. So the private school bonus really applies to students
*  who go to these independent schools, the private day schools and the boarding schools that tend to
*  be concentrated in places that also tend to be wealthy.
*  Okay, so that's private school polish. What is the third factor, according to the authors of the
*  study?
*  The third factor is athletics. And I think people understand that sports and recruiting are big
*  parts of college admissions. I don't think they understand quite how big they are, or how sports
*  interact with economic privilege.
*  So how does it?
*  Well, I think if you said to someone who tends to be on the sailing team or the golf team or the
*  fencing team, they would say, Oh, I assume it's kids who come from affluent backgrounds. Right.
*  But actually, it's almost every sport today that kids come from affluent backgrounds. Some of the
*  only exceptions happen to be the two highest profile sports, which is part of how I think our
*  impressions are a little off here. They're football and they're basketball. They're the sports
*  that people watch on TV. But if you look at almost any other sport, be it volleyball, be it soccer, be
*  it baseball and softball, what has happened because of the rise of quite expensive, high level
*  travel sports in high schools, that even in these other sports, I don't think most of us think of
*  baseball as a sport of the elite. And yet, even in a sport like baseball, the kids who are playing at
*  these colleges tend to come from quite affluent backgrounds, because that's who is able to do
*  travel sports when they're young, and then get so good at baseball, that they can be good enough to
*  play at one of these colleges, as well as having the academic qualifications to get it.
*  And how big a factor does the study say that sports and athletic recruitment are when it comes to
*  reinforcing the privileges of the privileged?
*  They're big. So if you look at one of these Ivy plus schools, and you look at the kids who come
*  from the top 1% of the income distribution, about one in every eight of those kids is a recruited
*  athlete. So one in every eight of the very affluent kids at these schools is a recruited
*  athlete. Compare that to lower income or middle income kids. Among those kids, only about one in
*  20 is a recruited athlete. So really, sports do skew quite affluent. And as those numbers show,
*  it's not just on the margins. It really is a meaningful part of the larger advantages to
*  affluence in the admissions process.
*  It feels worth noting, David, that I think a lot of us not only didn't know that sports played this
*  role in college admissions, but I think many of us, I'll just say I thought physical talent is
*  physical talent, speed is speed, right? Agility is agility. And that the best athlete, no matter
*  class, no matter finances would find their way to these colleges. And that understanding or perhaps
*  wishful thinking just turns out to be wrong. Money actually does create better athletes.
*  Yes, it is just the case that we have so much inequality in our country, that the better players
*  in these sports tend to be the kids who come from more affluent backgrounds. And there's something
*  else going on here as well, which is to be a student athlete at one of these schools, you also
*  have to clear a high academic bar. Now, it's not as high for any of the other categories we're
*  talking about. I mentioned before, legacy students have higher than average academic
*  qualifications. Athletes have lower than average academic qualifications at these schools. But what
*  they're doing is still kind of amazing, right? They are both really top athletes, and they are truly
*  excellent students. So in the individual basis, I really want to emphasize this, these students are
*  incredibly impressive and accomplished people. The issue is that when you look at it from a
*  society wide basis, this is a pattern that seems to be perpetuating advantage.
*  So it's pretty obvious, David, from all this data, who most benefits from the three factors we just
*  talked about, it's the rich and the super rich, who, according to this study, and all this data, is
*  most disadvantaged by the power of the factors that we've just been talking about.
*  I think there are a couple different answers to that question. And this is a really complex subject.
*  If we restrict ourselves to the students who actually apply to these schools, the most
*  disadvantaged is what we would call the upper middle class. It's the students from roughly the 70th
*  percentile to the 95th percentile of the income distribution. And so what happens is when the
*  colleges are looking at students who all have the same academic qualifications, the biggest
*  advantages go to the very wealthy kids for the reasons we've talked about. And the colleges also
*  give an advantage, a smaller one, but still an advantage to lower income kids. And I think a lot
*  of people, including college leaders, would say that's appropriate. These kids have been running
*  with wind in their face their entire lives and they nonetheless excel. Who that leaves out are
*  the upper middle class kids who they don't have the advantages of the very rich. They haven't
*  overcome disadvantage like low income kids have. Think of a kid who maybe is not an athlete, not a
*  legacy and doesn't attend private school. So going to a big public school in a city or a suburb,
*  and who's applying to one of these places. It is true that once that kid goes into the process,
*  that kid is the least advantaged. And I think it's important to talk about that.
*  I would just be careful. It's not the case that upper middle class children growing up in America
*  have less opportunity overall than poor children, because we're already restricting ourselves to
*  the children who apply to these schools. Poor kids have much less opportunity to do well in school.
*  Actually, even if they do well, they're less likely to apply to these schools than upper middle
*  class kids are. So depending how you look at it, you can either argue that poor kids are the most
*  disadvantaged, or if you look at just the admissions process, you can argue that upper
*  middle class kids are the most disadvantaged. What's clear is that very wealthy kids, the top
*  1% and particularly the top 0.1% are the most advantaged. Right. But just to linger for a moment
*  on the upper middle class kids who are applying to college and hearing this conversation or
*  hearing about this study, it may very much pain them and their families to discover that
*  what they believed was an economic position that conferred opportunity
*  has, in terms of college admissions and enrollment, become a kind of disadvantage given
*  the way the system is now constructed. Yes. And I think another way to think of that is that
*  if the privileges for the top 1% in this process were to go away, the beneficiaries would not
*  merely be low income kids. In fact, some of the biggest beneficiaries for these
*  large advantages for the very rich might be the merely affluent. I think that if all colleges did
*  were change their approach to private school polish or all they did was get rid of legacy or
*  all they did was change their approach to athletics, we shouldn't assume that that would
*  immediately allow a lot more low income kids to come to these colleges. We shouldn't assume
*  that it would allow a lot more underrepresented minorities to come to these schools. It would
*  certainly make that easier by opening up more spots, but it wouldn't guarantee it. And so
*  what happens on these college campuses is really going to depend on the full picture
*  of what colleges do after the Supreme Court ruling. And how many of the systems that we've
*  been talking about, they are willing to take on, fix, reform. Change, yes.
*  And one of the things colleges will tell you is that some of these things are harder to change
*  in their view than many outsiders think they are.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So David, let's talk about why all these systems of advantaging the well off,
*  it turns out, are harder to change than we might think. And I think we have to start with legacy
*  admissions, which very much seems like low hanging fruit, if you want to reform the stuff we're
*  talking about. So how do colleges think about legacy admissions? And why wouldn't they be
*  pretty quick to just eliminate it? I think when a lot of people look at legacy, they say,
*  how could this possibly exist? Part of the answer is, it's not something that college is invented.
*  It's actually the norm in American society. If you look around your company, there probably are
*  people who work there whose parents also worked there. If you think about Hollywood or the top
*  singers, a strange percentage of them had parents who are in the same business. Think about labor
*  unions. One of the main ways that people have gotten labor union cards over the decades,
*  going way back to the early 20th century and the rise of unions, was because a plumber had a dad
*  or an uncle or a brother who worked in that same union. That was legacy admissions for plumbers.
*  Right. And same for fire departments and police departments.
*  Absolutely. That's the way the world works. Franklin D. Roosevelt was a legacy politician.
*  So was Winston Churchill. Martin Luther King was a legacy minister. And I think although we can look
*  at that and we can say, wait a second, is that fair? It actually has enormous benefits when people
*  feel a long-term investment in an institution. We saw this during Trump's impeachment. Who were
*  the Republicans willing to stand up and actually vote to convict Trump? Many political analysts
*  pointed out. They were people whose parents had been in politics. Mitt Romney and Liz Cheney are
*  legacy politicians who felt a larger commitment to the enterprise that made them willing to do
*  something that was hard. This exists in a very real way for colleges. The people who are willing
*  to volunteer their time, the people who attend sporting events of the college, the people who
*  volunteer in all kinds of ways and raise money for the colleges, the people who help make connections
*  to help recruit a faculty member or help the college in some other ways, are often people who
*  don't simply feel a one-time connection to that school because they went there, but they feel a
*  multi-generational connection to the school. And yes, fundraising is part of this. It absolutely is.
*  It's an important part of it. A family that has sent multiple generations to the same school,
*  if that family happens to have someone who goes off and gets really rich starting a new company,
*  they're much more likely to give money to that school. But I think people misunderstand it when
*  they think of it as just a financial transaction. And they misunderstand it when they ask,
*  why are colleges doing this? The answer is healthy institutions in all kinds of realms of society
*  tend to have people and families who feel a long-term connection to an investment in
*  those institutions. So in the minds of these elite, highly selective colleges, there's a
*  real and tangible virtue to legacy admissions that's, as you're saying, not just financial,
*  but cultural and institutional, despite the pretty clear ways in which it furthers
*  the advantages of the rich. Yes. And let's also think about the way that these schools have changed.
*  These schools have become a lot more diverse over the last several decades. So yes, legacy
*  still disproportionately benefits white applicants, but with each passing year, it benefits white
*  applicants less. And the colleges will tell you, we have specifically heard from alumni of ours,
*  alumni of color, who say to us, wait a second, you kept us out of your institution for centuries.
*  And right after you let us in, you're going to get rid of a benefit that might let our children
*  go here as well. Fascinating. That is another way in which the politics of this are quite
*  complicated internally for colleges. So given all that, do we think that legacy admissions,
*  however much people see it as contributing to all this privilege in the process, is likely to persist
*  forever? Not necessarily. The outcome here is genuinely uncertain, which is part of what makes
*  this so fascinating. Political pressure against legacy admissions really is rising. Wesleyan
*  University and elite college in Connecticut just announced that they're getting rid of it. The
*  Biden administration just announced that it is launching a civil rights investigation of Harvard's
*  use of legacy admissions. We don't know what's going to happen, but I think it's fair to say
*  that the legacy system is more vulnerable than it has ever been before.
*  Okay. What are other ways that the colleges we've been talking about can mitigate against
*  the advantages the study has identified? Well, there's one that's really counterintuitive,
*  which is the SAT. We think of the SAT as perpetuating advantage because high income
*  kids do better than low income kids. White and Asian kids do better than black and Latino kids.
*  But the question is, if colleges aren't going to use the SAT, and many of them are moving away from
*  it, what are they going to use? And this study suggests that they may end up using a set of
*  factors that are actually more skewed than the SAT is. So essays and extracurricular activities
*  and teacher recommendations are actually more skewed in favor of the affluent than the SAT is.
*  And I think one of the things that this study suggests is that, yes, the SAT reflects a lot
*  of inequality in our society, but it also is a very good predictor of how students will do in
*  college and after. It is an imperfect measure to be sure. Rich kids can take the test more than once,
*  they can get private tutoring, but the benefits of all that stuff tends to be modest. And if
*  colleges want to identify really promising lower and middle income kids who can go there,
*  there is no tool quite as reliable as the SAT, even though when they're using it, they need to
*  remember that poor and middle class kids aren't likely to have quite as good scores as rich kids.
*  So you're saying of all the gameable metrics that colleges currently rely on that have resulted in
*  so much advantage for the rich, the SAT and the ACT, it might be, in a sense, the least gameable
*  test of someone's qualification, and therefore colleges perhaps should be relying on it more
*  than they are. Yes. And I know a lot of listeners will say, well, what about grades? And grades are
*  a good measure. The problem with using grades alone is we've had so much grade inflation in
*  recent years, and there's so much inconsistency about what an A means at one high school than
*  another, that grades end up being really noisy. And so you're left with standardized tests
*  as an imperfect measure, but maybe the least imperfect measure of all the options.
*  David, it feels like another way to fix this preference for rich applicants is for colleges
*  to explicitly seek to take more applicants from public schools than from private schools,
*  given the private school polish problem established by this study. That feels highly achievable,
*  and it feels like it would have a pretty big impact on the economic mix of students who
*  attend these colleges. Yes, I think that's right. I think if colleges focus on the fact
*  that right now they are disadvantaging many public school kids, they could fix this themselves
*  through the admissions process. But there's a downside for these colleges whenever we're
*  talking about them replacing affluent kids with much less affluent kids, which is affluent kids
*  tend to pay full tuition, much less affluent kids do not. They tend to receive large scholarships
*  from the colleges. And there are a few colleges out there that have such huge endowments that you
*  might say, well, they don't need any of the tuition money. But really, most of these colleges
*  do not have endowments that are so big that they can simply ignore the tuition money. And the
*  tuition money is so large that all of these colleges would need to find a way to make it up
*  if they were to change their student population to admit fewer affluent kids and more lower and
*  middle income kids. Now, it's important to say some colleges have done this. Several colleges
*  have become much more economically diverse over the last decade or so. One of them is Vassar
*  College in New York, which does not have a truly enormous endowment. And so what Vassar did was it
*  looked for other cuts to make to its budget. Its food wasn't quite as fancy as the food at other
*  colleges. You can imagine that colleges might try to cut back on some of the really nice facilities
*  that they now have for students. You could imagine that colleges would decide to cut back
*  on the amount of administrators they have. The number of administrators who work on college
*  campuses has really soared in recent decades. So there are ways for colleges to find savings
*  if they decide it is really a priority for them to admit and enroll more low income kids.
*  They just have to decide what's a priority for them.
*  Right. And I feel like the big question that hovers over this conversation, and I want to end on it,
*  is based on your reporting, do you think these colleges want to make these kinds of changes and
*  want to open up more spots for more economically diverse students? Because in talking to you,
*  it becomes clear that the current system works in some ways for these highly selective schools.
*  Right. It works for them financially to have lots of rich kids who pay full tuition.
*  It works for them in that legacy admissions reinforces their culture in ways that are
*  tangibly beneficial. And let's be honest, big change is hard and people may not want to undertake
*  it. So I'm curious if you think the people who run these schools are deeply invested in getting
*  rid of the three things we've been talking about, or if they're looking for ways to preserve them
*  and maintain a status quo that functions pretty well for them, even if it's very unfair.
*  I've been interviewing college administrators about these subjects for 20 years now, and I think
*  they are legitimately torn. The current system does have tangible benefits for colleges, as we've
*  been discussing, but the people running these colleges also care about their larger social
*  mission, which is educating people to help run American society. And they want those people
*  to come from a very broad cross-section of backgrounds. And so we see these cross-currents
*  right now, which is for the colleges, the current system has a whole bunch of advantages and they
*  have internal pressure from alumni groups and others to keep the status quo. On the other hand,
*  there is external pressure now coming onto these colleges to make changes. And I think they're
*  trying to grapple with where do they end up with all of this? I think what many critics of the
*  current system would say, including some of the researchers who did this paper, is they really
*  have room to move toward more fairness. Raj Chetty, who's a Harvard economist, is one of the people
*  who did this research. And what he said to me was, we don't need to put a thumb on the scale
*  in favor of the poor. We just need to take the thumb off the scale that colleges, perhaps
*  inadvertently, have put in favor of the rich. Now, I don't think we know exactly what's going to
*  change. But the fact that they have had a thumb on the scale in favor of the rich and that we now
*  know they have had a thumb on the scale in favor of the rich, when you combine that with the
*  politics of the Supreme Court decision, I think creates a lot of pressure on them to make some
*  changes in response to the concerns that people have about whether they are fulfilling the mission
*  that colleges themselves say that they have.
*  Well, David, thank you very much. We appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. In a dramatic court hearing on Wednesday,
*  the judge overseeing what was expected to be Hunter Biden's guilty plea to two federal tax
*  charges put the proceedings on hold after a disagreement erupted between Biden's lawyers
*  and prosecutors. The disagreement centered on whether Biden's plea, which involves no jail time,
*  would protect him from future prosecution over his business dealings. Biden's lawyers said that it
*  would offer such protection, a prospect rejected by the judge. It was the latest twist in a case
*  that has raised questions about whether Hunter Biden has been treated too harshly or too leniently
*  because he is the president's son. The Times reports that the judge could still approve the
*  legal agreement in the coming weeks. Today's episode was produced by Asli Chattervedi,
*  Ricky Nowetzki and Stella Tan with help from Jessica Chung. It was edited by Lisa Chow and

*  That's it for the Daily. I'm Michael Bobara. See you tomorrow.
*  you
