# The Secret History of Gun Rights
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EgJSquCX9g)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is a daily.
*  Today, a Times investigation reveals the secret history of how America's most influential
*  gun rights group amassed its power and the previously unseen role that members of Congress
*  played in designing the group's strategies.
*  My colleague, Mike McIntyre, explains.
*  It's Tuesday, August 1st.
*  Mike it's very well understood at this point that the NRA, the National Rifle Association,
*  is a seemingly insurmountable force in American politics.
*  So much so that even in an era defined by mass shootings and gun violence, it's managed
*  Congress to block almost every meaningful effort to regulate firearms.
*  And the basic dynamic is the NRA tells lawmakers what to do and a lot of those lawmakers do
*  it.
*  But you've spent the past few months carrying out an investigation that changes our understanding
*  of that dynamic.
*  So tell us what you did and what you found.
*  Well, it turns out that there's a flip side to this commonly understood narrative and
*  that there are members of Congress certainly who have carried water for the NRA, so to
*  speak, over the years.
*  But there is also a subset of lawmakers who are not just members of the NRA or supporters
*  of the NRA, but they actually serve on the board of directors of the National Rifle Association.
*  And so these members of Congress were in a position to not only influence firearms policy,
*  but also the path of the private organization most responsible for influencing it.
*  So there are many instances in which the conventional idea that we've had for some
*  time of a member of Congress sort of meekly accepting talking points or draft bills from
*  the NRA was actually the other way around.
*  It was the members of Congress who were telling the NRA what they needed to do.
*  And I think the one lawmaker that best exemplifies this, John Dingell, and we recently obtained
*  of pages of his files going all the way back to the 1960s, that really gave us the ability
*  to see what exactly he did for the NRA as a member of Congress.
*  And tell us, Mike, everything about Dingell and his relationship with the NRA and with
*  guns.
*  Where does that begin?
*  So Dingell, having been the longest serving member of Congress, it's something like 59
*  years.
*  One of the few things that probably lasted longer than that was his membership in the
*  NRA.
*  He actually joined the NRA as a boy, as many did during his generation.
*  His father was a hunter and an outdoorsman and was a New Deal Democrat, member of the
*  House representing a working class district outside of Detroit.
*  And so Dingell Jr. started as a page in Congress as a young kid.
*  One of his pastimes was shooting rats in the Capitol basement using an air gun.
*  He was known to actually hunt bears with a pistol, which requires a certain facility
*  with firearms.
*  So he was somebody with a familiarity and comfort level with guns that carried over
*  into Congress when he succeeded his father in 1955 in the same House seat.
*  Like a lot of people who had a similar mindset, he would cooperate with the NRA.
*  He was helpful to them in passing legislation or fending off bills that they liked or didn't
*  like.
*  But it wasn't until the 1960s, starting with the assassination of President Kennedy and
*  then going forward to the murders of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King later, that
*  you see not only concerted efforts to impose new firearms restrictions, mainly this is
*  a gun control act in 1968, but you also see Dingell becoming increasingly radicalized
*  in a sense.
*  He seems to be convinced that there was an existential threat to Second Amendment rights.
*  And he starts doing more and more somewhat extreme things.
*  He's getting his staff to research Nazi-era gun confiscation laws in Germany to try to
*  show that there's a slippery slope with gun control.
*  He considered having NBC News investigated by the FCC because he didn't like a gun rights
*  segment that they did.
*  We see speeches that he gave at NRA meetings in which he was really railing about patriotic
*  duty to defend what he saw as encroachment on Second Amendment rights.
*  So by the time you get to the end of the 60s, he has joined the NRA board.
*  And Dingell was starting to advocate internally that the NRA really shift its focus and become
*  more aggressive in fighting legislation to impose restrictions on guns.
*  Well, Mike, how was the NRA itself at that moment, as Dingell is becoming more radicalized,
*  how is it approaching the question of gun rights and gun control?
*  Is it seeing what's happening at that time as an existential threat?
*  The NRA was always somewhat conflicted up till then about what its role should be in
*  the whole gun debate.
*  Traditionally, going back to the late 1800s, it was an organization that focused on rifle
*  training and marksmanship.
*  In fact, they publicly supported some of what was passed as part of the Gun Control Act
*  of 68.
*  So, you know, this is also part of what was agitating Dingell during that time.
*  He'd become a member of the leadership of the group and he was not liking what he was
*  seeing.
*  So what does he do?
*  He's now a board member of the NRA who thinks its approach is insufficiently aggressive.
*  One of the first things he does, and this is a document that we discovered in his files,
*  was at the end of 1968, writes a memo to the executive of the NRA in which he for the first
*  time lays out the rationale for a new direction that the NRA should take.
*  And his key focus is on trying to establish a constitutional right for an individual ownership
*  of a gun, unconnected to the common defense.
*  So in other words, the Second Amendment to the Constitution talks about a well-regulated
*  militia.
*  What he is advocating in this memo is that the NRA start trying to work toward establishing
*  an understanding of the Second Amendment that would protect an individual's right to own
*  a gun for sporting and self-defense purposes.
*  And of course, that's an approach we now think of as the NRA's instantly recognizable policy
*  playbook that every individual has a Second Amendment right to a firearm that should not
*  be impeached in any way.
*  What you're saying you found in these records is that was Dingell, a sitting member of Congress's
*  idea, he was offering the NRA its intellectual framework for fighting gun control.
*  What happened to this proposal that he gives to the NRA?
*  Right.
*  He was offering this as sort of an intellectual framework and he was also suggesting the infrastructure
*  of how to achieve it.
*  And this became probably the most important document that we discovered in his files was
*  a 1975 plan for the creation of the NRA's Lobbying Institute, the Institute of Legislative
*  Action, which for anybody who's covered firearms issues as a journalist, it's sort of like
*  finding the Dead Sea Scrolls.
*  And by that I mean, it's essentially uncovering the original document that lays out the lobbying
*  playbook for the NRA.
*  Dingell writes, the NRA will use all available resources at every level to influence the
*  decision-making process.
*  And then he ticks off in detail what the organization will do, maintain files for each member of
*  Congress and key members of the executive branch, develop contacts in each congressional
*  office, majority and minority.
*  And he talks about using computerized data for the first time to try to influence members
*  of Congress and effectively increase their lobbying capacity.
*  And probably most importantly, begin funding and supporting legal research and court cases
*  that would lead the NRA to his objective of recognizing a Second Amendment right of an
*  individual to own a gun outside of the context of a militia.
*  It really kind of lays out in incredible detail what exactly the Institute was going to do,
*  what its goals were.
*  Dingell essentially wrote this document.
*  He proposed it at a board meeting in 1975 and the plan was adopted.
*  The old guard that ran the NRA at the time was very uncomfortable with this idea.
*  There was a letter which the head of the NRA wrote to a colleague saying that John
*  seems to think that we should become involved in partisan politics, but they didn't see
*  themselves as a lobbying organization.
*  So much as they did not like gun control, they were more interested in promoting sport
*  shooting and hunting and conservation, that sort of thing.
*  Right.
*  So Dingell's pushing them to go to a place they aren't instinctively ready to go.
*  So what happens to this bold strategy?
*  What do they do?
*  So Dingell succeeds in rewriting the mandate of the NRA and creating this new organization.
*  It took several years for it to get off the ground, but by the end of the decade, you
*  pretty much had an NRA which had been reshaped in the form that John Dingell foresaw.
*  But Mike, as we all know, in eventually adopting and pursuing this strategy that Dingell has
*  written for the NRA, the NRA becomes more and more affiliated with a single party, which
*  is the Republican Party.
*  But Dingell is a Democrat.
*  So based on your reporting, based on your reading of his personal and professional papers,
*  how does Dingell square that pretty obvious conflict between his party identification
*  and who the NRA is starting to identify with as it pursues his vision?
*  Well, Dingell, of course, came up during a period in which the partisan dividing lines
*  and firearms were not what they are today.
*  And I think it was more comfortable for Democrats in that era to be where he was on the side
*  of gun rights.
*  But by the time he gets to the 70s, he really would begin to make the argument to his fellow
*  Democratic Party members that they had the gun issue upside down and that they needed
*  to get more on board with how he viewed it if they wanted to continue succeeding in elections.
*  That's one of the interesting facets of his character is that he was very much in favor
*  of union rights.
*  He was pro-national health insurance.
*  He was a liberal, a Democratic Party favorite on many issues.
*  On this one thing, he was pretty far out there.
*  And yet he would try to make the argument again and again, all the way up till the time
*  he died, that the Democratic Party needed to get more in line with his thinking on gun
*  rights.
*  Once the NRA adopts this Dingell strategy, what does the playbook look like in practice
*  during this period of time?
*  Once the infrastructure was put into place, courtesy of John Dingell, the NRA in the subsequent
*  I'd say 10 to 15 years throughout the 1980s, the strategy really started to bear fruit.
*  During the 80s, you had the election of Republican president and Republican control of at least
*  one house in Congress.
*  They really, during this time period, succeeded in a lot of ways that previously were unimaginable.
*  They passed in 1986 one of the single most important firearms rights laws in the modern
*  era, the Firearm Owners Protection Act, which rolled back some of the limits imposed by
*  the Gun Control Act in 68.
*  You see during this time period also a continuing shift in the political affiliation of the
*  NRA membership.
*  There are increasing indications that the membership is becoming more and more partisan,
*  more and more conservative, right-wing, which is sort of leaving Dingell marginalized a
*  little bit.
*  The members of Congress who joined the board during this time, and there were several,
*  were all Republicans.
*  So you see in what's happening to the NRA sort of something similar to what's happening
*  culturally in the Republican Party.
*  And that is reflected in the choices of candidates for the Supreme Court that the NRA decides
*  to back.
*  It's reflected in the number of the people who joined the board during this time.
*  So this NRA and the political landscape all around it is starting to bear a lot more resemblance
*  to the NRA and political landscape that we know today.
*  Yeah, there was an increasing uncompromising attitude by the NRA in terms of not only the
*  legislation that they would accept or not accept, but also the willingness to enforce
*  their will on members of Congress who deviated from it.
*  And this again, harkens back to the outline that Dingell had written in 1975, where he
*  foresaw the need to maintain files on members of Congress to enforce allegiance.
*  So they had voter report cards in which they would give A through F for your willingness
*  to support their view of what gun rights should be.
*  Campaign donations were ramped up.
*  But as we know, the NRA could never really get all that excited about many Democrats.
*  When it came to those report cards, it was frequently the Democrats who were getting
*  the Ds and the Fs.
*  And in some races, and I've covered some of those races, those Democrats are being taken
*  out, targeted by the NRA.
*  And so from what you're describing, Mike, in almost every way, the modern NRA is a creature
*  of what Congressman Dingell wanted it to be.
*  Despite the NRA's original reluctance to become that, it sounds clearly like Dingell
*  designs the NRA to become the organization that so many members of Congress fear, especially
*  Democrats and moderate Republicans.
*  And rather that being the story we thought we know, like you said, of the NRA telling
*  lawmakers what to do, that was the dynamic.
*  It really was the story of a single member of Congress telling the NRA what to tell members
*  of Congress to do.
*  And the great irony is that as this sort of creature took shape that Dingell was responsible
*  for animating in the first place, it wound up blowing back against his own party.
*  He in some sense, foresaw the need to have them become more politically active, but there's
*  no way he could have foresaw how that activism would eventually be put into action.
*  So by the time you reach the end of the 1990s, the NRA has really positioned itself as the
*  dominant player in Washington politics when it comes to lobbying.
*  Their view is almost like the Death Star of lobbying in D.C.
*  And yet they were about to have probably their biggest test in the modern era in 1999 when
*  you had the Columbine school shooting in which two teenagers murdered 12 classmates in the
*  suburb of Denver.
*  And there was an immediate reaction to that in Congress that was going to really force
*  the NRA to face one of its biggest tests.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Mike, remind us how the NRA responds after the national trauma that is the Columbine shooting.
*  So there's a huge push in Congress to do something about the private sale of guns at gun shows
*  since a couple of the weapons that were used in the Columbine shooting were purchased at
*  a gun show in Colorado.
*  And the private sale of guns, in other words, the guns that were sold not by a licensed
*  dealer, but just by anybody who sets up a table at a gun show, they're not subject to
*  background checks.
*  And so there was an effort in Congress to impose that background check requirement for
*  the first time.
*  The NRA strongly objected to that.
*  One of the arguments they had was that gun shows are on the weekends, they usually don't
*  last more than three days.
*  And so if you're to impose a three-day background check requirement, which is what was being
*  considered, most gun shows would end before the background check could be completed and
*  the sale couldn't go through.
*  So John Dingell, who by that time was actually off the board of the NRA, but he was still
*  very much helpful to them, he worked with the NRA to come up with an amendment to the
*  legislation being considered, which would require that a background check be limited
*  to 24 hours.
*  They have to be done in one day or the gun sale would go through automatically.
*  Now the problem with that, as he and his staff well knew, because this is in the notes that
*  we found in his files, was that most background checks, even though they're done very quickly,
*  if a person has committed a crime and court records are needed to confirm their eligibility
*  to own a gun, well, since gun shows happen on the weekends, most courts are closed on
*  the weekends.
*  And so it would be impossible to conclude the background check for a potentially disqualified
*  person.
*  Dingell knew this, but he pushed ahead with the amendment anyways, and he succeeded in
*  getting it added to the bill, which pretty much neutralized the effect of the legislation
*  and in fact ended up killing it.
*  Basically he sabotages his entire plan to regulate guns bought at gun shows.
*  That's how you could view it.
*  And the NRA internally, because we have the record showing it, viewed that as a big legislative
*  victory, the failure of legislation.
*  He was praised as a master leader at a board meeting.
*  And in fact, a year later, they honored him with a legislative achievement award.
*  And so in many ways, that was sort of the 25 year culmination of what John Dingell had
*  laid out back in the early seventies.
*  So this was a key flashpoint in the history of firearms violence in this country that
*  required them to step up and use the tools that Dingell has essentially helped provide
*  them with.
*  And they succeeded in preventing any meaningful gun legislation from taking place.
*  And of course this pattern repeats itself throughout the 2000s where more and more mass
*  shootings are happening.
*  Each one leads to calls for some sort of gun control, which never seemed to go anywhere.
*  Even after Sandy Hook, in which 20 students and six adults were shot to death in Connecticut,
*  there was a task force put together to recommend new gun restrictions and nothing came of that
*  either.
*  By the time that John Dingell retires in 2015, the landscape has really shifted in favor
*  of the gun lobby in a way that it had not been when he first started out with his vision
*  for what the NRA should become.
*  And his legacy in some respects is just that.
*  You now have a Washington that is largely beholden to the gun lobby in a way that had
*  not been the case previously.
*  The NRA itself has lost a lot of its power largely through internal turmoil, external
*  investigations.
*  But in some interesting sense, I mean, there isn't even a need for what they do anymore
*  because so much of what they sought to do has been institutionalized.
*  You now have Supreme Court decisions that have basically reshaped, reframed our view
*  of the Second Amendment and the gun culture has just changed dramatically.
*  Ownership of a gun has become pretty much a political identifier in many ways.
*  And so there isn't really the need for the lobbying juggernaut that John Dingell had
*  envisioned back in 1975 because that juggernaut succeeded in getting us where we are now.
*  It's quite ironic, interestingly, because I mean, when he did pass away in 2019, he
*  had written a memoir shortly before that in which he does not really dwell on the issue
*  of guns much at all, but where he does in the very end of the book, he does express
*  some reservations about his role in all of this.
*  He doesn't repudiate it.
*  What do you mean?
*  What are his reservations?
*  He doesn't repudiate it.
*  He doesn't back away from anything he did, but he does talk about how he wondered whether
*  or not he contributed to the polarization that exists now and the issue of guns, the
*  debate about it.
*  He expresses the view that, you know, why can't we have a discussion about it?
*  He seemed to be at the end of his life suggesting that the absolutism that he had practiced
*  up to that point was beginning to moderate, where he was open to the idea of considering
*  things that he previously would not have been.
*  Well, it's interesting to hear you describe him as worried about polarization around guns
*  because from everything you have described here, there's no one more responsible for
*  that polarization around guns than John Dingell, who wrote the blueprint for the strategy that
*  polarized guns.
*  And he actually owns up to that in his memoir.
*  He says he thought about the role that I know I played in contributing to that polarization.
*  So he does accept it.
*  That is the case.
*  But there's nothing indicating that he doesn't feel like his role in cementing the gains
*  that the NRA was able to achieve over the years was anything other than something to
*  be proud of.
*  You know, this is an accomplishment for him.
*  It was something that he talked a lot about all the way to the end.
*  And I think there's every reason to believe that, you know, he saw this as nothing other
*  than a victory.
*  So Mike, in the end, I wonder if we should see the NRA's unique success in American
*  politics as really only possible because it so early on had an insider from Congress on
*  its board telling it how to craft its strategy and carrying out that strategy from the inside
*  in the person of John Dingell.
*  And if you're any other lobbying group in DC pushing for issues like abortion or for
*  oil drilling in Alaska, shouldn't that model make you want to replicate this strategy for
*  your operation?
*  Like get yourself a congressman on your board to do your bidding and you'll have success.
*  Or should this arrangement, this dual arrangement of congressman, congresswoman being a board
*  member, should it make us very uncomfortable?
*  And is it just a conflict of interest we should avoid?
*  Put quite simply, is this a success or is this a cautionary tale?
*  It's really kind of a shocking arrangement.
*  I mean, there is nothing comparable to it either.
*  And it's entirely allowed, which is something which I think a lot of people also don't
*  realize is that if you belong to a nonprofit group, as a member of the board, you can serve
*  in Congress at the same time.
*  In some ways, it's somewhat unique.
*  There is no other comparable situation that you can look to on an issue other than firearms.
*  But when you look back at what the members of Congress who served on the board of the
*  NRA were able to achieve and how they're able to influence not just firearms policy in
*  Congress, but the organization itself that was most responsible for influencing that
*  policy, it's a dynamic that is inarguably a conflict.
*  And it was recognized as such even by John Dingell at one point when he resigned from
*  the board of the NRA in 1994.
*  He admitted he had an irreconcilable conflict.
*  So it's something which in many ways it may not happen again, but there's nothing preventing
*  it from happening again.
*  Right.
*  In fact, there's everything to suggest, based on your reporting, that if you're a group
*  trying to get something done in Washington, it should be replicated.
*  Sure.
*  I mean, right now there's nothing which would prevent any other advocacy group that as long
*  as they're nonprofit, as long as the member of the board who happens to be in Congress
*  is not paid for doing that, they essentially are lobbyists who are lobbying themselves.
*  That's about what it amounts to, is that members of Congress are serving on the board in a
*  leadership capacity of an advocacy group that is lobbying the congressman.
*  So it really is kind of a through the looking glass arrangement.
*  And certainly in the case of the NRA, it worked wonders.
*  Well, Mike, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Yes, absolutely.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Monday, an affiliate of the Islamic State claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing
*  that killed at least 54 people at a political rally over the weekend.
*  The group said that the attack was part of its war against democracy as a system of government.
*  The suicide bombing, the latest in a string of terror attacks over the past year in Pakistan,
*  suggests that the country is losing control over its security.
*  And the Times reports that Phoenix, Arizona has now experienced temperatures of at least
*  110 degrees Fahrenheit for 31 days in a row.
*  That not only breaks Phoenix's previous record of 18 straight days of those temperatures,
*  but sets a startling new set of records.
*  The extraordinary heat has filled local hospitals with patients suffering from heat stroke and
*  burns.
*  And so far this year, the city's medical examiner has reported at least 25 deaths related
*  to heat.
