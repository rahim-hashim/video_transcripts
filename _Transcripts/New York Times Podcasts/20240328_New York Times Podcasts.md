# The Newest Tech Start-Up Billionaire? Donald Trump
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntgzK9xhIeQ)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Over the past few years, Donald Trump's social media company, Truth Social, was dismissed
*  as a money-losing boondoggle.
*  Today, Matthew Goldstein on how, over the past few days, it somehow became a publicly
*  traded company worth billions of dollars.
*  It's Thursday, March 28th.
*  Matthew, thank you for coming.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  On The Daily, your debut.
*  Yes.
*  Do you go by Matt?
*  I go by Matt.
*  I go by Matt.
*  You're a Matthew byline.
*  Because my mother likes me using you.
*  When I first started out, my mom says, I named you Matthew.
*  You should use Matthew for your bio.
*  Because I initially did use Matt.
*  And then she got it.
*  This is literally the tale of the Jewish mother.
*  Yes.
*  The way all journalism sort of starts.
*  Why did you go into journalism to begin with?
*  Right.
*  You could have been a doctor.
*  Here we are.
*  At least use my name.
*  Okay.
*  So, Matt, I wonder if we could start by having you tell us the current market value of this
*  new publicly traded company, Donald Trump's social media business.
*  Okay.
*  So as we sit here.
*  11.26 a.m. on Wednesday.
*  On Wednesday.
*  It's trading right now for around $65 a share.
*  If you work that out, it's worth about $8 billion.
*  That's huge.
*  That is huge.
*  I think it's bigger than the New York Times, actually.
*  I think the New York Times is like around $7 billion.
*  It's bigger than a lot of companies, you know, which is crazy when you think about it.
*  Yeah.
*  And what is Donald Trump's personal stake in that?
*  And what is that now?
*  Okay.
*  So he owns 79 million shares.
*  So roughly doing the math.
*  And this changes that somewhere is around $5.6 billion.
*  It's been going up sometimes as high as even $6 billion.
*  That's extraordinary.
*  That is extraordinary because if you believe what Forbes had said last fall, he was worth
*  about $2.6 billion.
*  So he's more than doubled his net worth in basically the last few days with Trump Media.
*  Wow.
*  And not a moment too soon, right?
*  Because as we've talked about on the show, Trump owes about every last cent of cash he
*  has.
*  I think it's an estimated $500 million or so to various courts.
*  And this would be very auspicious timing to suddenly have an extra $5 billion in his
*  life.
*  It's a critical lifeline for him right now.
*  There of course are limitations to how he can tap that money.
*  But I think also should not be understated.
*  It's a huge bragging point for him, which he likes to go out and talk about being the
*  most successful businessman on the planet.
*  He can say, look, I built a company that's worth $7 billion overnight.
*  Where have you done that, Joe Biden?
*  Or where have you done that pretty much almost anyone other than a very select, rarefied
*  group of tech startups?
*  Absolutely.
*  So tell us the story of how this company, which I think a lot of people candidly dismissed
*  from the beginning as Trump's little kind of renegade corner of the internet somehow
*  became this, a real financial behemoth in a way.
*  What is that story?
*  So you have to go back to January 2021.
*  Trump is kicked off of what was then Twitter after the January 6 riots at the Capitol.
*  And not just Twitter, right?
*  Facebook, Instagram.
*  Yeah, he was kicked off everything.
*  But Twitter was really where he had lived, as we all knew.
*  Right, tens of millions of followers.
*  Tens of millions.
*  So Trump is at this low point.
*  He's out of the White House.
*  He's sort of down there in Mar-a-Lago.
*  And all of a sudden, a blast from the past.
*  He gets approached by these two guys who had been contestants on his old reality show,
*  The Apprentice.
*  And their names are Andy Latinsky and Wes Moss.
*  I'm no dummy.
*  No, I know.
*  You know.
*  They're not particularly notable or famous people.
*  I don't know if the word is stars on the show.
*  To be perfectly honest, I want to see Mr. Trump as much as possible.
*  Latinsky was a really young guy.
*  I chose to the men dominating the women.
*  Wes Moss came out sort of as like almost like a frat boy type of character.
*  Andy, you're fired.
*  Wes, you're fired also.
*  And they weren't particularly successful, but they go to Trump.
*  And what exactly is their pitch to him?
*  Their pitch is basically forget about Twitter, forget about all these other platforms, create
*  your own platform, create your own social media company.
*  It'll be great.
*  You won't be censored.
*  You can say whatever you want.
*  All your followers will come here, will make a lot of money, will be huge.
*  What was Trump's response?
*  Well, he's intrigued, but he never really totally commits to anything.
*  At that point, Trump is sort of taking a back seat on it.
*  He's basically agreeing to lend his name, if nothing else.
*  They sign an agreement that they're going to go out and sort of pitch the deal.
*  And the apprentice guys know that they're going to need a lot of money to get this company
*  off the ground.
*  But they're not going to be able to turn to traditional Wall Street sources because Trump
*  at this point is kind of toxic.
*  He's a toxic guy.
*  So the solution for the apprentice guys to raise this money was to do something called
*  a spec, which is these companies that have come into vogue during the pandemic.
*  They're basically shell companies that go public, raise hundreds of million dollars
*  from investors.
*  And essentially, their sole purpose is to go out and look for another company to buy.
*  Kind of shell companies.
*  Shell companies, right.
*  It's basically money and a bank account that's just sitting there to be transferred over
*  to the private company that you buy.
*  So for the private company that ends up merging, it's a great deal because they get tons of
*  cash where they had nothing the day before.
*  And the other advantage of a deal with the spec is that beyond the cash, the private
*  company becomes a public company and that gives it the ability to sell stock to investors
*  and go out and raise more money that way.
*  And then through that merger, eventually the two companies coming together, the company
*  that Trump is going to be ostensibly heading, that social media company would get everything
*  the spec could raise from investors.
*  So all that cash is going to come flooding into the company the apprentice guys envision.
*  So if I'm understanding this plan correctly, the apprentice guys envision a plan where
*  they go off, they find a spec that has raised a bunch of money, and eventually it will merge
*  with the Trump social media company they envision building.
*  And when that marriage is consummated, their work will be over and they will hopefully
*  have a lot of money.
*  Basically, that's exactly what their goal was.
*  Yeah.
*  So the apprentice guys are out there in the market looking for a spec.
*  They've given the lack of really any kind of business plan.
*  They don't go to the top flight guys out there.
*  They end up at the bottom of the barrel.
*  And so they end up with essentially a very no name sounding spec called Digital World
*  Acquisition Corporation.
*  Digital World has its IPO in September of 2021, raises $300 million.
*  Lo and behold, like a month after a press release comes out late at night, Donald Trump
*  and Trump Media are merging with Digital World Acquisition Corp.
*  I remember people pinging me, is this a joke?
*  Because most people, I'm sure I had never heard of Digital World.
*  And even more people had no idea that Trump was even doing a social media company.
*  Because while all this is going on and they're trying to put a deal together, the social
*  media platform that will become Truth Social hasn't even launched and it won't do so for
*  months later.
*  But there's trouble right away.
*  The Securities Exchange Commission comes in and announces it's open an investigation
*  into how this deal came together, looking into whether Digital World violated securities
*  laws by engaging in merger talks ahead of time, which technically is in kosher in the
*  way specs are supposed to work.
*  But this investigation just drags on and on and on, and it's going to delay everything.
*  So this is turning out to be a pretty big mess.
*  Very big mess.
*  It looks like this deal is never going to happen.
*  And finally, when they launched Truth Social in early 2022, it's a little bit of a joke.
*  It's like this sort of very early version of Twitter when it's sort of clunky.
*  How clunky?
*  You were on it?
*  Yeah, I actually think I was one of the first people to get in, which I thought was sort
*  of funny because I said I was from the New York Times.
*  They actually verified me.
*  Mazel tov.
*  There was very little traffic.
*  It was almost like you'd post something and like the cr- you could literally hear the
*  crickets.
*  Trump never posted for three months.
*  Trump never posted on Truth Social, the site that exists for his-
*  And I remember writing a story and you couldn't get an answer from them.
*  Why is he not posting?
*  Perhaps because he has his own doubts.
*  And also it wasn't a place, no one was there.
*  I mean, they had a few million users.
*  There's like a few million dollars in advertising on Truth Social, a lot of them the equivalent
*  of almost late night TV advertising that you would see.
*  It's losing tons of money, which is in fairness, it's not unusual for a startup company to
*  lose money, but it was not clear where it was ever going to make money and where the
*  money was going to come in.
*  And we're looking at this thing, is it even going to happen?
*  Your deal is in trouble because of regulators and also the company's in trouble because
*  there's just nothing there.
*  So everyone, I think for the most part, sort of counts this thing out.
*  For them it was a desperate situation.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  And then last summer, a bunch of things started to go right all of a sudden for Trump media.
*  And it really started to raise the prospects that this deal actually could happen.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, but how is it that things start to turn around for this real mess of a social media
*  company that Donald Trump has founded?
*  Okay, so the single biggest thing was last summer, the SEC settles its investigation
*  with Digital World, with the SPAC that it was merging with.
*  And that basically at that point sort of clears the gates for them to start to really move
*  forward with the merger.
*  What kind of settlement was it?
*  They had to pay $18 million and they had to rewrite all their disclosures to make it consistent,
*  to reveal all the early talks they had had with Trump media.
*  The other thing is, Elon Musk buys Twitter, now X, and one of the first things he does
*  is he says, Trump, you can come back.
*  We're posting again.
*  We want you.
*  We love you.
*  Everyone thinks Trump's going to do that, but then he stays.
*  He continues to post on Truth Social, and it's clear he's sticking with his own platform.
*  And if anything, he starts ramping up his postings on Truth Social.
*  And they become increasingly, as we know with the way Trump is, bombastic, inflammatory,
*  He's been sticking all the judges and all the cases going on, the prosecutors, political
*  opponents, and he's been doing it with increasing frequency.
*  And this is a key ingredient of last summer's turnaround, because it's clear at this point,
*  Trump is sticking with Truth Social.
*  He's not going anywhere.
*  He's leaning into it, and it's become his platform.
*  But we shouldn't lose sight that maybe the most important thing is the loyalty of shareholders.
*  And I'm not talking about big hedge funds, big institutions, wealthy people.
*  I'm talking about ordinary Trump supporters, many of them who are posters on Truth Social
*  and happen to be stockholders of this cash-rich SPAC that's eventually going to merge with
*  Trump Media.
*  And they're the ones who have kept this thing going to some degree.
*  As investors.
*  As investors.
*  Because there were many points where the SPAC deal itself could have just failed.
*  But they really want to make sure this company succeeds.
*  It's almost like a religious kind of thing for some of them.
*  And I can tell you one guy has been very vocal, is actually sort of a Christian minister.
*  Good evening, D-Wax stock.
*  He has his own streaming video show on Rumble, which he called D-Wacked Live, named after
*  the shares.
*  Lord, we ask in the name of Jesus that you help the executives finish this strong and
*  that you protect them from all the forces that would try to stop the merger.
*  Where they talk about the stock and the merger and it's got his own following.
*  Just all show up at Mar-a-Lago, knock on the door and be like, hey, President Trump, we'd
*  like to come party with you because we all own little bits of your company and we love
*  you.
*  Let's just check on the price one more time before we head out for the night.
*  So in some way, Trump really owes a lot to his small shareholders who made this possible.
*  Because if it wasn't for them, there would be no merger.
*  And when they talk to you about why they have bought shares in this business, in this SPAC,
*  even when it's at its least successful and most imperiled, how do they talk about why
*  it's worth their hard earned money?
*  First of all, they view their building something.
*  And they've all believed that right or wrong, whatever you may think about it, that truth
*  social is free from censorship that allows Trump and others to say what they want.
*  And they really believe that as the founding principles, they're the original owners essentially
*  going to be at this company and they're helping it flourish and build.
*  So this has become a real personal thing for a lot of them, more so than I think I've ever
*  seen with any other publicly traded company before.
*  So the folks who are investing in this SPAC, anticipating it will eventually get together
*  with truth social and who, as you have just said, sustain this through its darkest chapter,
*  they aren't really there because they see this as a highly profitable business.
*  You just said, Matt, that it was losing money.
*  They're doing it as a statement and I guess a measure of their fervor for Trump, for the
*  movement he represents.
*  Buying the stock is a way for them to put their money where their mouth is when it comes
*  to MAGA.
*  Right, right.
*  For them, this is about supporting Trump and supporting this company, which they view as
*  critically important and keeping its message out there alive.
*  So I think that more or less brings us to this week, right, when this turnaround you're
*  describing results in this crazy takeoff of the stock price.
*  But just walk us through the mechanics of it.
*  What happened was there's the shareholder vote and the way it works is digital world
*  shareholders have to vote to approve the merger with Trump Media.
*  At this point, it was a foregone conclusion, but it's a vote, so you never know what's
*  going to happen though.
*  And they get the vote on Friday.
*  It's overwhelming.
*  I think it was 29 million shares voted in favor and 200,000 voted against.
*  I mean, you just don't see that.
*  A landslide.
*  A landslide, yes.
*  Like an electoral landslide.
*  So the deal goes through.
*  On Monday, the deal is actually closed.
*  We have our first day of trading on Tuesday of this week as DJT.
*  Donald J Trump.
*  Former President Donald Trump's newly merged social media company has begun trading and
*  shares are soaring.
*  It opens for trading at around 40 something dollars a share.
*  More than 6.5 million shares in Trump Media had changed hands by 950 this morning.
*  They have to actually halt trading briefly because the volume, the level of trading
*  is off the charts in the stock.
*  And currently, take a look at where shares are.
*  They're up about 40 percent.
*  At one point, it reaches 70 dollars a share.
*  This is the highest profile stack we've seen in quite a while.
*  Really I'd say ever, Katie.
*  And on the end of trading on Tuesday, it closes around 60 dollars or so.
*  And that's how we get this seven, eight billion dollar valuation for the company.
*  In the paper gain of 5.6 billion for Trump, for Trump.
*  For now, quote unquote, DJT is the mother of all meme stocks with the stock up 32 percent,
*  up as much as 58 percent today.
*  Hard to disagree.
*  I just want to make sure I understand why this company is now valued so highly.
*  And I guess what I'm really getting at is, is there an actual business case for it, given
*  what folks in your calling would describe as the fundamentals of the business?
*  Or is this just a measure of these Trump supporting investors deep affinity for him?
*  Is this basically a bubble or is there maybe a true financial justification that can be
*  laid out here?
*  OK, so if we go pure fundamentals, it's crazy.
*  This company is not a seven or eight billion dollar company.
*  It had three point three million dollars in revenues for the first nine months of last
*  year.
*  It lost about 49 million dollars.
*  Yeah, that is not the makings of an eight billion dollar valuation company.
*  No, no, no.
*  I mean, the one good thing it got going, it got three hundred million dollars in cash
*  from this merger, not for Trump, for the company.
*  So that's good.
*  They can use that cash to go out and buy something, bring in more people, hire influencers on
*  Truth Social.
*  But even then, they have 10 million downloads of Truth Social.
*  I mean, Twitter is what, like hundreds of millions of users?
*  I'm sorry. X has a hundred millions of users.
*  Where's it going to go for that kind of growth to justify that?
*  But this is what Wall Street is.
*  I mean, you know, we call them our meme stocks.
*  They're fantasy stocks.
*  They take on a life of their own.
*  We had this during the pandemic with GameStop and AMC.
*  The shares run up to ridiculous levels driven largely by retail investors.
*  Right.
*  And just to remind people, those were stocks where retail investors were buying shares.
*  It felt like because they wanted to send a message, largely anti-establishment message.
*  They were mad at a hedge fund that had shorted it.
*  In one case, I remember they wanted to make a point.
*  They wanted to stick it to the man.
*  Right.
*  And also, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
*  It becomes a mania.
*  And others sort of see this and get in because you feel like if you keep buying, it's never
*  going to fall.
*  It's never going to go down.
*  And that can work for a while, but eventually gravity will always take hold at some part.
*  I'm not saying that Trump media is going to collapse, but at some point something will
*  happen that will trigger the stock to sell off.
*  Right.
*  It's fragile.
*  It's fragile.
*  Right.
*  It's not sustainable at this level.
*  When it's happening, it's hard for me or anyone to give you a rational reason.
*  And that's why there's this old thing, a rational exuberance.
*  It's not necessarily unusual.
*  It's just that it's unusual because you have a very loyal investor base to him personally
*  that is driving a lot of these surges in the stock.
*  I'm really curious how Trump's position in this presidential campaign factors into what
*  you just described, because it feels like this irrational exuberance has to be linked
*  somewhat to the reality that he is the now lead candidate in the polls for reelection.
*  But I'm curious what investors think about that, how they link his chances of becoming
*  president with the financial health and future promise of this company.
*  It's definitely, I think, going to be a barometer, sort of Trump and his political fortunes.
*  I mean, just by way of example, the SPAC stock started to soar this year when Trump was on
*  the verge of locking up the nomination.
*  It was around the time DeSantis dropped out in New Hampshire.
*  The stock surged like 60, 70 percent overnight.
*  It was really because people were like, hey, Trump is going to be the nominee and we're
*  going to be going forward.
*  But can you just explain that?
*  What does one have to do with the other?
*  In theory, it doesn't have anything to do with it, but it's like a proxy for him.
*  It's also the idea that as long as Trump is still politically viable, Trump media is viable.
*  Truth social is viable.
*  And presumably a president 2.0 Trump is the best possible situation for this stock price.
*  If he wins, I think it probably will be a high watermark for the stock.
*  And I would just think given the dynamic with the election right now, it's hard to see the
*  stock not continuing to rise, at least until November.
*  OK, I want to turn now to Trump's access to this very valuable stock at a time when, as
*  we all know, he seems to need money.
*  How and when could he tap into this money?
*  OK, so at the moment, he actually can't.
*  Can't.
*  He can't.
*  It's called a lockup, a restriction.
*  It's not just for him.
*  It's for any major shareholders.
*  They can't sell for six months.
*  It's actually not unusual in these kind of circumstances.
*  The logic is you don't want important people to the company, important shareholders to
*  bolt as soon as the deal goes through.
*  But there are other ways he can get around that.
*  One way is for the board.
*  It's a seven member board.
*  They're all loyalists for the most part.
*  They could allow him to sell shares early.
*  I personally think that's unlikely because it shows a lack of faith.
*  Just like if he had jumped from Trude Social onto Twitter, this would be the same kind
*  of message being sent.
*  What they could do is allow him to pledge those shares, meaning he can go out and get
*  a loan, use it as collateral.
*  The shares don't get sold, but you're giving them to some other like a bank or probably
*  more likely a hedge fund.
*  So that would be a way for him to monetize his stock without actually selling it.
*  So if Trump really wanted to, he could find a way working through this board of loyalists
*  to tap into this money pretty quickly if he so chose to.
*  If he asked the board to do it, I think there's probably a good chance the board would do
*  it.
*  But if he doesn't really need the money that desperately, I think he probably won't.
*  I think the board would be reluctant because it doesn't really help anyone to have lots
*  of stock coming out into the market.
*  That only will probably depress the price of the shares.
*  It doesn't help to have the face of the company, the man whose initials are on the ticker,
*  selling the stock because that suggests he doesn't have a tremendous amount of faith
*  in the business.
*  That might trigger a sell-off, which would undermine the value of the rest of the stock.
*  It's a pretty bad cycle to start.
*  That's like the event that starts to send the sell-off.
*  Even at that point, even your most loyal shareholders may say, well, I don't want to be left the
*  last one holding the bag.
*  Right.
*  I want to step way back for just a minute and think about the larger meaning of what
*  has happened with truth social.
*  I've covered a lot of Trump's businesses through the years, investigated them when he was a
*  in 2016.
*  And it really strikes me that of all the businesses he's been in, real estate, casinos, Trump
*  University, selling Trump steaks, Trump wine, whatever, you know, those made money.
*  This in some ways feels like the least sound business of all.
*  And yet it has made him the richest by far.
*  It's a little bit weird to wrap your head around.
*  What does that tell you about the nature of Trump and these investors who believe in this?
*  It is weird.
*  I'm not a politics reporter, but from a business perspective, this has given me a little bit
*  better insight into his seemingly unending kind of popularity and support.
*  Because the old adage on Wall Street, never fall in love with the stock.
*  But the reality is a lot of his shareholders here are in love with the stock.
*  They have fallen in love with it and they're in love with him to a large extent.
*  And when you have that sort of mix there, it allows a stock to soar to sort of unreal
*  levels that we're seeing now.
*  And who knows where it goes from here.
*  But for the moment, it's clearly working for Mr. Trump.
*  Well, Matt, thank you very much.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  When the stock market closed on Wednesday afternoon, shares of Trump's new media company
*  reached $66 a share, up 14% from the previous day.
*  As of this morning, the company is worth $9.4 billion.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Authorities said that the six missing workers who were on the Francis Scott Key Bridge when
*  it collapsed are now presumed dead.
*  The workers were members of a construction crew who were repairing masonry and potholes
*  when a massive container ship plowed into the bridge on Tuesday morning.
*  This is no ordinary bridge.
*  This is one of the cathedrals of American infrastructure.
*  Experts say that rebuilding the bridge, which carried 30,000 vehicles a day, will probably
*  take years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars, a reality acknowledged by the Secretary
*  of Transportation Pete Buttigieg.
*  So the path to normalcy will not be easy.
*  It will not be quick.
*  It will not be inexpensive.
*  But we will rebuild together.
*  And the first ever congestion pricing system in the United States crossed a major milestone
*  on Wednesday when New York officially approved tolls for cars driving through the busiest
*  sections of Manhattan.
*  The system, modeled on those in London and Singapore, is designed to significantly reduce
*  traffic and air pollution.
*  The tolls, $15 for most passenger cars and as much as $36 for large trucks, are expected
*  to raise $1 billion a year for mass transportation.
*  The new system could still be blocked by several lawsuits seeking to derail it, but if those
*  cases fail, the tolls will begin in mid-June.
