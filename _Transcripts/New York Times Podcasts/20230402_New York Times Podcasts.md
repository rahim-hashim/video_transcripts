*  Hi, I'm Uisas Low and I'm a writer at large for The New York Times.
*  For this week's Sunday read, I'm going to be sharing a story that I wrote for the paper.
*  It's about a couple that has been running a sandwich shop near the Arizona State Capitol
*  in Phoenix, Arizona for 37 years.
*  And now surrounding that business is one of the largest homeless encampments in the
*  country where on some nights, 1,100 people are sleeping outdoors, intense, in clapboard
*  structures on wooden pallets in the middle of the road.
*  Sometimes just face down on the sidewalk within blocks and sometimes frankly within feet
*  of their business.
*  I write about how the big issues in the country impact people's lives and I've seen homelessness
*  increasing around the country in a lot of my reporting trips and also in the city where
*  I live in Portland, Oregon where homelessness is the number one issue for everybody here
*  and also increasingly the number one political issue for many cities across the American
*  West.
*  So once I started thinking about that issue, I began calling business owners around
*  the country and trying to figure out where is a place that I can go to not only inform
*  people about this story but hopefully to make them feel it, to make them understand what
*  it's like.
*  I talked to dozens of business owners.
*  I thought maybe I would go to San Jose or Sacramento or San Francisco or Salt Lake City.
*  And in this canvassing of making a bunch of calls, I learned about what was happening in
*  Phoenix where there is a homeless encampment on the edges of downtown that is larger than
*  all but maybe one or two encampments in the country.
*  One of those calls was to Joe and Debbie and I think what immediately made their story
*  resonate with me is that their sandwich shop is not just a business.
*  It's a place they started together when they were a young couple.
*  They then expanded the little back part of this restaurant to build a nursery for their
*  kids.
*  They expanded into catering to help pay for those kids to go to state college.
*  Every part of them has been invested inside this restaurant.
*  Joe said something when I was with him that's in the story that I think summarizes what
*  I saw better than anything I could say, which is who is this working for?
*  Us, them, inside, outside, nobody's winning.
*  I think that one of the things that I found in Phoenix and hopefully one of the things
*  that the story shows is a system that is broken at this point and is not working for anybody.
*  So here's my article.
*  He had been coming into work at the same sandwich shop at the same exact time every weekday
*  morning for the last four decades.
*  But now Joe, Fyallegi, 69, pulled up to old station subs with no idea what to expect.
*  He parked on a street lined with three dozen tents, grabbed his mace and unlocked the door
*  to his restaurant.
*  The peace sign was still hanging above the entryway.
*  Fake flowers remained undisturbed on every table.
*  He picked up the phone and dialed his wife and business partner, Debbie Fyallegi, 60.
*  All clear, he said, everything looks good.
*  You're sure no issue, she asked?
*  What's going on with the neighbors?
*  He looked out the window toward Madison Street, which had become the center of one of the
*  largest homeless encampments in the country, with as many as 1,100 people sleeping outdoors.
*  On this February morning, he could see a half dozen men pressed around a roaring fire.
*  A young woman was lying in the middle of the street, wrapped beneath a canvas advertising
*  banner.
*  A man was weaving down the sidewalk in the direction of Joe's restaurant with a saw,
*  muttering to himself, and then stopping to urinate a dozen feet from Joe's outdoor tables.
*  It's the usual chaos and suffering he told Debbie, but the restaurant's still standing.
*  It had seemed to them like an open question each morning for the last three years, as
*  an epidemic of unsheltered homelessness began to overwhelm Phoenix and many other major
*  American downtowns.
*  Cities across the West had been transformed by a housing crisis, a mental health crisis,
*  and an opioid epidemic, all of which landed at the doorsteps of small businesses already
*  reaching a breaking point because of the pandemic.
*  In Seattle, more than 2,300 businesses had left downtown since the beginning of 2020.
*  A group of fed up small business owners in Santa Monica, California had hung a banner
*  on the city's promenade that read,
*  Santa Monica is not safe, crime, depravity, outdoor, mental asylum.
*  And in Phoenix, where the number of people living on the street had more than tripled since
*  2016, businesses had begun hiring private security firms to guard their property and lawyers
*  to file a lawsuit against the city for failing to manage, quote, a great humanitarian crisis.
*  The file eachies had signed onto the lawsuit as plaintiffs, along with about a dozen other
*  nearby property owners.
*  They also bought an extra mop to clean up the daily flow of human waste, replaced eight
*  shattered windows with plexiglass, installed a rod iron fence around their property, and
*  continued opening their doors at exactly eight each morning to greet the first customer
*  of the day.
*  Hey, bro, the usual, Joe said to a construction worker who always ordered Italian on wheat.
*  Love the new haircut, Joe said a few minutes later to a city employee who came from meatballs
*  three days each week.
*  Debbie arrived to help with the lunch rush, and she greeted customers at the register while
*  Joe prepared tomato sauce and weighed out 2.2 ounces of turkey for each chef's salad.
*  Their margins had always been tight, but they saved on labor costs by both going into work
*  every day.
*  They remodeled the kitchen to make room for a nursery when their children were born, and
*  expanded into catering to help those children pay for college.
*  They kept making the same nine original house sandwiches for a loyal group of regulars,
*  even as the city transformed around them.
*  Its population growing by about 25,000 each year, inflation rising faster than in any other
*  US city, housing costs soaring at a record pace until it seemed that there was nowhere
*  left for people to go, except on to sidewalks, into tents, into broken down cars, and increasingly
*  into the air conditioned relief of old station subs.
*  I need to place a huge order, a woman said, as she walked up to the counter wearing mismatched
*  shoes and carrying a garbage bag of her belongings.
*  I own dairy queen.
*  Oh wow, which one Debbie asked, playing along?
*  All of them, the woman said, I'm queen of the queen.
*  That's wonderful, Debbie said, as she led the woman to a table with a menu and a glass
*  of water, and watched as the woman emptied her bag onto the table, covering it with
*  rocks, expired bus passes, a bicycle tire, clothing, 17 batteries, a few needles, and
*  a flashlight.
*  Would you like me to take an order, Debbie asked?
*  You know why I'm here, the woman said, suddenly banging her fist against the table.
*  Don't patronize me, the king needs his payment.
*  Debbie refilled the woman's water and walked behind the counter to find jail.
*  For the past several months, she had driven into work with stomach pain and stress headaches.
*  She'd started telling Joe that she was done at Old Station, whether that meant selling
*  the restaurant, boarding it up, or even moving away from Phoenix for a while without him.
*  She had begun looking at real estate in Prescott, a small town about a hundred miles away,
*  with a weekly art walk, mountain air, a few lakes.
*  What am I supposed to tell this lady, she asked him, I can't keep doing this, every minute
*  it's something.
*  Joe reached for her hand.
*  It'll get better, stick with me, he said.
*  But now they could hear the woman tossing some of her belongings onto the floor.
*  The king needs his ransom, she shouted.
*  I'm sorry, but it's time to go, Debbie told her.
*  You thieves, you devils, the woman said.
*  Please Debbie said, this is our business.
*  We're just trying to get through lunch.
*  The restaurant was located a half mile from the Arizona State Capitol in an industrial
*  neighborhood of warehouses and crisscrossing train tracks that had always attracted a small
*  number of transients.
*  Over the years, Joe and Debbie came to know many by name and listened to their stories
*  of eviction, medical debt, mental illness, and addiction.
*  And together they agreed that it was their job to be Christly, to offer not only compassion,
*  but help.
*  They had given out water, opened their bathroom to the public, and cashed unemployment and
*  disability checks at no extra cost.
*  They hired a sandwich maker who was homeless and had lost his teeth after years of addiction.
*  A dishwasher who lived in the women's shelter and first came to the restaurant for lunch
*  with her parole officer.
*  A cleaner who slept a few blocks away on a wooden pallet and washed up in the bathroom before
*  her ship.
*  But the homeless population in Phoenix continued to grow by hundreds each year.
*  Even as the city's supply of shelter beds remained relatively flat.
*  And a federal court ruling in 2018 required places with no shelter capacity to allow some
*  camping in public spaces.
*  The city's average rent rose by more than 80% during the pandemic.
*  A wave of evictions drove more people from their homes.
*  Until for the first time ever, more than half of Phoenix's homeless population was finding
*  refuge not in traditional places, like shelters or temporary apartments, but in cars or tents.
*  Soon there were hundreds of people sleeping within a few blocks of old station.
*  Most of them suffering from mental illness or substance abuse as they lived out their
*  private lives within public view of the restaurant.
*  They slept on Jo and Debbie's outdoor tables, defecated behind their back porch, smoked
*  methamphetamine in their parking lot, washed clothes in their bathroom sink,
*  pilfered bread and gallon jars of pickles from their delivery trucks, had sex on their patio,
*  masturbated within view of their employees, and lit fires for warmth that burned down palm trees
*  and scared away customers.
*  Finally, Jo and Debbie could think of nothing else to do, but start calling their city councilman,
*  the city manager, the mayor, the governor, and the police.
*  We've got a guy outside who's naked, trespassing and need some serious help.
*  Jo reported in a call to the police in the fall of 2021.
*  They're throwing rocks from across the street at our windows, he said,
*  in another call a few months later.
*  Breaking and entering, vandalism, harassment, I'm probably leaving some stuff out, he said.
*  She's swinging a pipette people. Would you consider that normal, he said?
*  It's a fire the size of my house.
*  My customers are trying to eat and they can't even breathe, he said.
*  Gunshots shouting, it goes on all day, he said.
*  Within a half mile of their restaurant, the police had been called to an average of eight
*  incidents a day in 2022. There were at least 1,097 calls for emergency medical help.
*  573 fights or assaults, 236 incidents of trespassing, 185 fires, 140 thefts, 125 armed robberies,
*  13 sexual assaults and four homicides. The remains of a 20 to 24-week-old fetus were burned
*  and left next to a dumpster in November. Two people were stabbed to death in their tents,
*  16 others were found dead from overdoses, suicides, hypothermia, or excessive heat.
*  The city had tried to begin extensive cleaning of the encampment, but in December the American
*  Civil Liberties Union successfully filed a federal lawsuit to keep people on the street from being,
*  quote, terrorized and displaced. And now Joe and Debbie arrive for work on another morning and
*  notice the woman sprawled on the sidewalk with her face against the pavement. Debbie watched for
*  a moment until she saw the woman roll onto her side. Maybe she was sick, maybe she was just asleep.
*  Let's give her a bit to get sorted, Debbie said. But at lunchtime, the woman had barely moved,
*  and two hours later she was still lying there as the temperature climbed and Debbie began to
*  imagine the worst possibilities. More than 1,250 homeless people had died in Maricopa County in
*  the last two years, including hundreds from drug overdoses or heat exposure. Other nearby property
*  owners had started calling the neighborhood Death Row. Debbie picked up the phone and dialed 911.
*  I'm concerned, she said. It sounds like someone who could be resting, the dispatcher told her.
*  Maybe, Debbie said, but I'm about to go home for the day. Can you do a wellness check?
*  That would mean sending the fire department and lately firefighters had been her
*  assed or assaulted so often within the encampment that they typically responded with a police escort.
*  The dispatcher explained that it wasn't possible to send a full team of emergency medical workers
*  to check on every person on the street who might in fact be taking a nap. And she suggested that
*  Debbie approach the woman herself to ask if she needed help. I'll stay on the line with you,
*  the dispatcher offered. Debbie stood by her car and watched the woman's chest rise and fall.
*  At least a dozen times in the last month, Debbie had been screamed at, threatened,
*  or verbally assaulted on the street by people who were suffering from severe mental illness.
*  Until sometimes she felt her compassion, giving way to fear and anger.
*  The woman said, keep doing nothing. She hung up and drove home.
*  A while later, the woman got up off the sidewalk and walked to a tent across the street.
*  The woman's name was Sheena Sapoveda and she had been living in the encampment for a few weeks
*  or maybe for a few months. It was hard to know for sure, she said, because she had been experiencing
*  delusions. What she remembered was escaping from a cult in Mesa, building the first internet
*  search engine, losing billions of dollars to a government conspiracy, cutting wire taps out of
*  her brain, retaking her diagnostic name of SB Rockefeller, and then moving onto an 8 by 8-foot
*  plot of sidewalk across the street from Old Station Sub's. For as long as she had been homeless,
*  she tried to nap during the relative safety of the day and stay up late at night to help look over
*  her small corner of the encampment. She put on makeup and sat down at a plywood desk where a
*  handwritten nameplate introduced her as, quote, doctor, poet, psychologist, partner at law,
*  and wherein reality she was now the 47-year-old caretaker of a half-dozen people. Because even if many
*  of her stories were fantastical, she had earned a reputation for being generous and kind and for
*  knowing a bit about everything. Hey, SB, can you help me? Brandon Mack said as he walked over from
*  his nearby tent. He lifted his shirt to reveal two stab wounds from a few days earlier.
*  He had fought with a neighbor over a coveted corner spot on the sidewalk, walked to the emergency
*  room, gotten 18 stitches, and then returned to recover on a molding mattress and a partly burned
*  tent. Oh yeah, it's infected, SB said. I saw a lot of this when I was a surgeon. How do you feel?
*  I'm alive, he said. This isn't a life. It's an existence, SB said. As she took out a pair of
*  scissors, scrubbed them with hand sanitizer and started to cut away a few of his stitches.
*  She wiped away the pus and blood with napkins, tossing them into the street. Then she turned her
*  attention to the next person in need of help. Cecilia wanted soap, so SB handed her a bar she had
*  scavenged from the nearby shelter. CJ was drunk and needed help getting into the street to go the
*  bathroom. A man known as KD was moving his tent 50 yards down the sidewalk because he'd gotten
*  into an argument with a neighbor who insulted his pit bull. Nobody talks down to dots, KD said,
*  I'm ready to go off. I'm armed and dangerous. I was a police officer, SB told them, if you really
*  have to shoot, don't aim to kill. Just fire a warning shot. The sun went down and SB saw her closest
*  friend and neighbor, Kip Poulston 65, coming back from the bus stop carrying a bucket and his 10-foot
*  window washing pole. In the last year, he had lost his business to heroin addiction, his apartment
*  to eviction, and his truck to an accident. Now he was working to get clean, leaving his tent at
*  5.30 each morning for an appointment at a methadone clinic before riding the city bus to businesses
*  all across Maricopa County. He was trying to piece his life back together one window at a time,
*  washing each for $3. He'd washed 268 windows in the last month, but he was still nowhere close to
*  saving enough for a security deposit and rent. So instead, he had settled into an encampment so immense
*  that it operated as its own separate economy. Blue fentanyl pills sold for $2, and anyone could
*  trade a decent pair of shoes for a week's supply of methamphetamine. A group of young men in the
*  encampment had begun selling off pieces of the public sidewalk, charging each person $20 a week
*  for what they called, quote, lot rent and security. That had seemed ridiculous to Kip until he
*  decided not to pay and then awoke one night to the smell of someone dousing his tent with lighter fuel.
*  He stood on the sidewalk to brush his teeth, went into his tent, and turned on his portable radio.
*  It reminded him of sleeping inside his truck, so he usually kept it playing all night.
*  Too loud, S.B. He asked. Now, Kip, you're fine, she said.
*  He tucked his toothpaste into his backpack and noticed a small bag with the leftover remnants of
*  black tar heroin. There was just enough to numb himself out so he could forget about his
*  methadone appointment in the 18 windows he was scheduled to wash the next day. He held the bag in his
*  hand for a moment, opened the zipper of his tent, and tossed it outside. Joe came into work the
*  next morning and saw a bag of drugs in the road, human waste on the sidewalk, a pit bull wandering
*  the street, and blood soaked napkins blowing toward his restaurant patio, where he and Debbie were
*  scheduled to meet with a real estate agent about the future of old station. Debbie still insisted that
*  she was ready to be done with the restaurant. Joe didn't want to run it without her, but he also
*  didn't want to board it up and walk away with nothing. They had spent the past several months
*  exploring a compromise, seeing if they could sell the business and retire together.
*  Are we getting any bites? Joe asked the agent, Mike Gata, as they sat on the patio.
*  Oh yeah, I get calls every week, Mike said, and he explained that at least 25 potential buyers had
*  looked over the financials and recognized a strong family business for the reasonable price of
*  $165,000. Several bailed once Mike mentioned the encampment, but at least a dozen potential
*  buyers secretly came to old station to check out the property. Most of the time, they don't call back,
*  Mike said, if I track them down, it's like, God bless those people for staying in business,
*  because I couldn't do it. It's taken years off my life, Debbie said, for her it's, get me out,
*  we've got a sell, sell, sell, sell, Joe said, but we refused an offer for $250,000 eight years ago,
*  and it keeps dropping. I don't want to give this place away. I can't afford it. I get it, said Mike,
*  if you were a half-mile in another direction, you'd be sitting on a million bucks. Instead,
*  it's, how can you dispose of it? Joe sat with that word for a moment as he smoothed the wrinkles
*  from his apron. He had worked in restaurants since he was 15 when he started washing dishes at his
*  father's Italian diner in Montreal. He'd learned how to cook and keep the books, but his father had
*  mostly shown him that a restaurant could succeed because of an owner's charisma, and Joe brought
*  that philosophy to Phoenix. A lot of places could make a good ham and cheese. Old station had thrived
*  for 37 years because of Debbie's hugs at the entryway, Joe's teasing at the register,
*  and the hand-picked signs and inside jokes that covered every inch of their walls.
*  We've put all of ourselves into this place, Joe said. They didn't have a pension. Their plan
*  had always been to invest in the business, sell it, and use that money to retire. They weren't
*  seeking any damages in their lawsuit, but instead were asking the city to remove the encampment
*  and find a different solution to care for its occupants. Lawyers for the city had argued in court
*  that the case should be dismissed because Phoenix was already working to go, quote, above and beyond,
*  to address the problem. It had opened a new office of homeless solutions, and it was spending more
*  than 50 million on outreach programs, mental health services, and the creation of 800 more shelter beds
*  in converted hotels and refurbished shipping containers.
*  Maybe it all turns around in a few years, Joe said. That's not on my timeline, Debbie said,
*  physically and mentally, I cannot keep waking up to this level of stress. But maybe in six months,
*  Joe started, and she shook her head and gestured across the street. You'll be dealing with this alone,
*  she said. It's aging you. It's eating you up. How much longer can you do it? I don't know,
*  he said.
*  A few days later, Joe drove four blocks through the encampment to visit the one person who could
*  always make him feel better about the state of the neighborhood. Joe Coplin, 68, owned a building
*  that was now surrounded by more than 55 tents, and yet he continued to run in art gallery downstairs
*  and live with his wife upstairs. He never seemed to run out of hope or compassion or patience,
*  and that's what Joe thought he needed. Meet the luckiest dog in the world.
*  Joe said to Joe, introducing him to a stray puppy that he'd adopted after its owner overdose
*  in the encampment. She'd been tied up and barking for days when I found her.
*  You've got a good heart, buddy. Joe said, me, maybe not so much anymore.
*  I've got a bleeding heart. Joe said, inviting him inside.
*  The gallery had been named the best new art space in Phoenix when it opened in 2019,
*  but lately, Joel could barely persuade a dozen people to come into the neighborhood for a weekend
*  opening, so he decided to turn his attention to the bigger problems outside. He'd lived for a while
*  in an abandoned building in Hell's Kitchen when he was an art student in New York,
*  and he knew what it was like to be homeless. He began inviting some of his neighbors into the gallery,
*  offering them food and firewood, paying for some of their medical bills, and sometimes painting
*  their portraits as he listened to their stories. He had tried to help sterling, who sang prayers and
*  a patchy over his meals at the soup kitchen and lived for a while in the bed of Joel's truck.
*  And Rosie, a grandmother and a heroin addict, who was always asking Joel for, quote,
*  one last five, which he kept giving to her. And Jennifer, a prostitute in the encampment,
*  whom he allowed to use his bathroom until she started bringing guests with her.
*  He banned her from the restroom despite her pleading, and a few nights later, she was arrested a
*  block away for public urination. That charged, triggered a warrant for another previous offense,
*  which meant she was now serving four years in prison, and Joel was putting $80 each month
*  onto her commissary card to help assuage his guilt. And then there was Keisha, barely out of her teens,
*  who had skittered around the encampment like a scared cat, wary of everyone, carrying a few old
*  dolls and crying sometimes. Joel had tried to watch out for her, offering her water or a few
*  minutes inside whenever she was upset. But one weekend, when he wasn't around, the temperature
*  was 115 degrees, and she lay down on the curb near his gallery and died of heat exposure and dehydration.
*  Not a lot of happy endings here these days, Joel said. He took out his phone, handed it to Joe,
*  and hit play on a video that he had recorded a few nights earlier, from the window of his upstairs
*  apartment. There were 26 broken street lights in the encampment because of vandalism and wire theft,
*  so the video was dark, except for the reflection of police lights, which illuminated one man being
*  handcuffed, and another lying dead on the ground. My wife and I were relaxing after dinner,
*  all fat and happy, and then it was, BAP BAP BAP BAP BAP BAP! Joel said,
*  did you hit the floor, Joe asked? Well, yeah, we have our castle dark and our fortress strong,
*  but it's becoming crazy. Our fence got cut the other night, and there was a woman in our yard,
*  screaming and yelling her head off in Spanish. Joe handed back the phone and shook his head.
*  I'm realizing here lately that we're living in a frigging hellhole, he said,
*  us, them, inside, outside, who's it working for? When does it stop?
*  Not yet, Joel said. He explained that he had heard rumors from within the encampment
*  that there would be more gunfire because of a turf battle over pieces of the sidewalk.
*  Joel had already called to warn the police, and now he suggested that Joe leave the neighborhood
*  before dark. It's hard to believe, but they're telling me it will get worse, he said.
*  Joe arrived for work early the next morning to the sound of a gunshot coming from across the street,
*  and a bullet hanging off a nearby fence. He hurried inside the restaurant and locked the door
*  behind him. He crouched low beneath the windows and called the police. Yeah, it's Joe again,
*  over at Old Station, he said, and a few minutes later, two police officers were walking the perimeter
*  of his restaurant with flashlights in the pre-don darkness, searching for the bullet.
*  Joe ran cold water over his hands, changed into his apron, and tried to focus on the day ahead.
*  Fresh fruit cup on special, he wrote on the chalkboard, and then he started preparing fruit cups
*  as he looked outside and watched the encampments start to life as if it were just any other morning.
*  SB set up her desk on the corner. Kip came out of his tent and started assembling his window
*  washing pole. The police drove through the area and left without making any arrests.
*  KD came out of his tent with his pit bull and started pacing the sidewalk, screaming to himself,
*  waving his arms in the air, and narrating the events of the previous night for everyone to hear.
*  Y'all made me go psychotic, he yelled, as Joe stirred his tomato sauce.
*  You come at me with a nine millimeter, and I'm pulling out my 45, KD said, as Joe weighed the turkey.
*  Next time, there won't be no warning shot, KD shouted, as Joe unlocked the door for the first
*  customer of the morning and looked up at the clock. It was just after 8am, but now Debbie would be
*  waking up and getting ready for work. Soon she would be pulling into the parking lot to help handle
*  the lunch rush. What the heck am I going to tell her to keep her from losing it, Joe wondered,
*  as he began to rehearse the possibilities in his head? It was only one bullet, nobody had gotten
*  hurt. The police had come right away. The shooter wasn't targeting the restaurant, the gunshot was
*  random. It could have happened anywhere. Joe poured tomato sauce over the meatballs and went
*  outside to get some air. KD was still ranting on the sidewalk, banging his hand against a fence,
*  contorting his fingers into the shape of a gun, and then firing it off at the sky.
*  This could be the last straw for her, Joe said. And then he saw Debbie driving toward the parking lot,
*  staring around KD and hurrying through the gate. Wow, tough morning, she asked.
*  He took her inside the restaurant while he tried to come up with the right words.
*  It was only one shot. The restaurant was still standing. They'd run an old station together
*  for 37 years, and maybe they could hang on for a while longer. But instead, Joe put his hand on
*  her shoulder and told her the only thing that felt true. The whole thing's a disaster, he said,
*  I get it. It's okay. I understand why you're done.
