# Gold Bars, Wads of Cash and a Senatorâ€™s Indictment
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHcb_KoPpIw)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi and this is The Daily.
*  In one of the most explosive political corruption cases in recent history, federal prosecutors
*  have accused a senior U.S. Senator of trading the power of his position for cash, gifts
*  and gold.
*  Today, my colleague Tracy Tully, on the lurid charges against Robert Menendez, his wife
*  Nadine and an Egyptian-American businessman at the center of the scheme.
*  It's Tuesday, September 26th.
*  So Tracy, tell me about this corruption case against Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey.
*  You know, it came out at the end of last week and I was reading the coverage over the weekend,
*  it just seemed to get bigger and bigger.
*  The details are just kind of unbelievable.
*  It's now Monday afternoon.
*  Tell me what we know.
*  So Senator Menendez, who's a Democrat, he's in his third term in the Senate, but he's
*  represented New Jersey in Congress for three decades.
*  He was the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
*  And he is now accused of taking bribes, which came in the form of a Mercedes convertible,
*  hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and gold bullion bars.
*  And in exchange for these gifts and bribes, according to the indictment, he is accused
*  of trying to help several businessmen in New Jersey and also a foreign government of Egypt.
*  Okay, so this is something we don't hear about in the Senate every day, a sprawling bribery
*  case involving a foreign power, piles of cash and gold bars.
*  I mean, it's just remarkable.
*  So let's dig in here.
*  Where does the story of this case start?
*  Well, this story starts pretty much where his last legal troubles ended.
*  This morning, New Jersey's senior senator finds himself in the defendant's seat as day
*  one of his corruption trial gets underway.
*  In 2017, he stood trial.
*  It was a nine week trial for corruption.
*  Menendez is facing multiple counts of bribery and conspiracy for allegedly.
*  He was accused of accepting gifts and bribes from a doctor.
*  There was a hung jury.
*  The judge threw out the most serious charges.
*  A mistrial was declared today in the federal bribery trial of Democratic Senator Robert
*  Menendez of New Jersey.
*  The jury in Newark was hopelessly deadlocked after six days of deliberations.
*  To those who embraced me in my darkest moment, I love you.
*  To those New Jerseyans who gave me the benefit of the doubt, I thank you.
*  And Justice Department in late January of 2018 decided not to pursue the case any further.
*  And a few weeks later, he starts dating a woman who is at the center of this new investigation,
*  Nadine Arslanian.
*  So who is Nadine Arslanian?
*  Tell me about her.
*  Nadine is also from New Jersey, not far from where Menendez is from.
*  She's a stay-at-home mom with two adult children, and she struggled financially after her divorce.
*  They begin dating in February of 2018.
*  And by all accounts, it's a whirlwind romance.
*  They start traveling together.
*  Puerto Rico, Greece, Turks and Caicos, Colombia.
*  And finally, in October of 2019, they're in India traveling.
*  And he pops the question.
*  It's videotaped and in grand style in front of the Taj Mahal in song.
*  He's fond of singing and calling people for their birthdays and singing happy birthday.
*  But he sings Never Enough from The Greatest Showman.
*  Wow, that's quite a proposal.
*  It was quite a proposal, yes.
*  She accepts.
*  Oh my God.
*  And one year later, they're married in a small pandemic ceremony in Queens.
*  So how did this whirlwind romance turn into a legal liability?
*  What happened?
*  So before Nadine even began dating Senator Menendez, she was part of a social circle
*  in northern New Jersey, a small group of friends.
*  And they would go to dinners together and they shared a love of Cuban cigars.
*  And some of them did karaoke.
*  And one of these people is an Egyptian-American businessman by the name of Will Hanna, who
*  had some experience with import export into Egypt.
*  And he becomes a very central character in Nadine and Senator Menendez life, but also
*  in the indictment.
*  What do you mean?
*  Well Hanna, according to the indictment, is the link to the bribery scheme involving Senator
*  Menendez and his wife, Nadine.
*  Hanna runs a halal certification company based in New Jersey.
*  And he, in a meeting with the Senator and Nadine, agrees to put Nadine on the payroll
*  of his company in a low or no show job.
*  And in exchange for this compensation for Nadine, Senator Menendez, according to prosecutors,
*  agrees to help further the interests of the Egyptian government by way of military equipment
*  and financial aid at a time when the Egyptian government was very concerned that its aid
*  could have dipped based on some very public concerns about humanitarian issues that were
*  going on in Egypt.
*  And why was Hanna doing that?
*  Was he connected to the Egyptian government or the Egyptian military?
*  Was he working for them?
*  We really don't know, but he definitely had connections with Egyptian military leaders.
*  And they developed a system whereby Nadine would pass messages to Hanna and then Hanna
*  would pass them to the Egyptian officials, sometimes in encrypted calls, sometimes through
*  text messaging.
*  We know at one point that at the request of an Egyptian official, Senator Menendez, according
*  to the indictment, actually ghost wrote and edited a letter trying to convince other U.S.
*  senators to provide $300 million in aid to Egypt.
*  And he sent this secret letter to Nadine from his personal email account.
*  Nadine then forwards this ghostwritten letter to Hanna and then Hanna sends it back to
*  Egyptian officials.
*  Were there other things Menendez was alleged to have done on behalf of Egypt?
*  Yes, there were several specific things mentioned in the indictment that Senator Menendez is
*  accused of doing.
*  For example, at one point, he seeks information from the State Department.
*  It's nonpublic information regarding the number of people and the nationality of people
*  at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo.
*  This was not classified information, but it was deemed highly sensitive because it could
*  pose some significant security concerns if disclosed.
*  And they pass this information from Nadine to Wil Hanna and then ultimately ends up with
*  an Egyptian military official.
*  And in another situation, there is a discussion about military financing and foreign military
*  sales to Egypt.
*  And the next day, Senator Menendez texts Nadine and says, tell Wil I'm going to sign off on
*  this sale to Egypt today.
*  And Nadine forwards this text to Hanna.
*  Hanna forwards it to an Egyptian official.
*  And the Egyptian official replies via text with a thumbs up emoji.
*  So Menendez is using his really powerful position in the Senate to essentially help Egypt with
*  some of the things it wants from the U.S., including military aid.
*  And he's doing it through Hanna as an intermediary.
*  At the same time, Hanna has put Menendez's wife on staff at his company.
*  That's right.
*  And an interesting part of the indictment was there's a sense that Nadine was very frustrated
*  by her friend Hanna because the company wasn't doing terribly well.
*  And in turn, she wasn't being paid for her low or no show job.
*  But that all changes April of 2019, when all of a sudden the Egyptian government gave this
*  company the monopoly, this halal monopoly.
*  And Wil Hanna's company is pretty much overnight given the entire United States business.
*  All meat imported into Egypt, certified halal comes through Wil Hanna.
*  And that's a sudden change of fortune for Hanna.
*  And it turns out also for Nadine.
*  In one text cited in the indictment, Nadine texts Senator Menendez,
*  Seems like halal went through.
*  It might be a fantastic 2019 all the way around.
*  So the government of Egypt is giving effectively carte blanche to this one tiny company run
*  by Hanna.
*  So, you know, this decision gives essentially a monopoly to Hanna's company and enriches
*  him and Nadine.
*  But does that connect to Menendez?
*  Is there a line there?
*  The indictment shows that Menendez does get involved here.
*  After the Egyptian government gave a monopoly to this one company, several people from the
*  USDA raised concerns.
*  They raised concerns because prior to this monopoly, four companies in the United States
*  have been doing this work.
*  And they were concerned that this shift to a sole operator could increase costs of meat
*  to an entire nation and also could disrupt markets in the United States.
*  The USDA asked the Egyptian government to reconsider its decision.
*  And around that time, in late May, Senator Menendez calls a high level USDA official
*  and essentially conveys the message to back off and to stop raising objections to this
*  monopoly.
*  So when do federal prosecutors actually close in on Senator Bob Menendez?
*  Like when does this go from an investigation where they're looking into things into a criminal
*  prosecution where he's being charged?
*  Well, what we know is that in June of 2022, federal agents raided the home of Nadine and
*  Senator Menendez in Englewood Cliffs and also searched a safe deposit box in Nadine's name.
*  And they found a lot.
*  And we learned exactly what it was they found last Friday.
*  My name is Damian Williams and I'm the United States Attorney here in the Southern District
*  of New York.
*  When the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Damian Williams, revealed all
*  of the many items that were taken from their house that day.
*  Special agents with the FBI executed search warrants on the residence and safe deposit
*  box of Senator Menendez and Nadine Menendez in New Jersey.
*  And those included approximately $500,000 of cash stuffed into envelopes and closets.
*  Cash.
*  Agents also discovered a lot of gold.
*  13 bars of gold bullion.
*  Home mortgage payments.
*  A Mercedes Benz.
*  And other things of value to the senator and his wife.
*  It was really stunning what prosecutors laid out.
*  This investigation is very much ongoing.
*  We are not done.
*  And I want to encourage anyone with information to come forward and to come forward.
*  It was so sweeping and so damning, if true, that it led political leaders throughout the
*  state and throughout the country to begin to question whether Senator Menendez had become
*  so compromised that he could not serve any longer.
*  And this then all set the stage for the political challenge that Senator Menendez is now facing.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Tracy, really explosive charges in this indictment.
*  What is the initial reaction to them?
*  It was swift.
*  We just got a statement from the governor.
*  And let me read it to you because it's very serious.
*  So by five o'clock Friday night, the governor of New Jersey, Phil Murphy, who's a Democrat,
*  issues an email.
*  The allegations in the indictment against Senator Menendez and four other defendants
*  are deeply disturbing.
*  And calls for Menendez's immediate resignation.
*  The alleged facts are so serious that they compromise the ability of Senator Menendez
*  to effectively represent the people of our state.
*  Within seconds, a tsunami of emails flow in from pretty much all other major Democratic
*  leaders in the state.
*  In lockstep calling for Senator Menendez's resignation, which was very different than
*  what we saw in 2017 when political leaders throughout the state stood with Senator Menendez.
*  And Tracy, why would they not have done that in the past prosecution of Menendez, but they're
*  doing it now?
*  Why are they calling for his stepping down now?
*  I think there's two reasons for that.
*  One is the indictment appears on its face to be far more serious this time around.
*  It involves a foreign government, federal aid, weapons, and potentially meddling into
*  criminal investigations.
*  But additionally, when Senator Menendez faced trial in 2017, New Jersey had a Republican
*  governor, Governor Chris Christie, which meant that if Menendez had stepped down, then the
*  governor would have chosen a Republican replacement more than likely.
*  But now, if Senator Menendez were to step down, a Democratic governor, Governor Murphy,
*  would choose his replacement.
*  And so it's a little bit of a different calculus.
*  Okay, so that's Democrats in the state of New Jersey.
*  What about national level Democrats?
*  They've had a far more muted response.
*  We heard initially from Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, basically saying he deserves
*  his day in court.
*  Let's not rush to judgment.
*  A few other folks in the Senate have, in fact, called for his resignation.
*  John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, as was Sherrod Brown of Ohio.
*  But in general, the White House was sending signals that they're not going to put their
*  fingers on the scale, that it's really up to Senator Menendez and the Democratic leaders
*  in the Senate to decide whether he steps down or not.
*  I think it's slightly different because they're concerned more about the balance of power
*  in the Senate, which is already a razor thin majority for Dems, and not upsetting that
*  balance of power if they don't need to.
*  And what was considered a very safe seat for a very long time, the thought of having to
*  defend that seat and to spend money defending it is not appealing.
*  So what does Menendez himself actually say about what happened and the charges?
*  We heard a lot at a news conference held in his home turf in Hudson County, Union City.
*  Good morning.
*  Thank you to all of you who are here today, especially the New Jerseyans who have joined
*  me as I address the events of the last few days.
*  And he basically asked, and he used the word humbly.
*  I humbly ask.
*  All I humbly ask for in this moment is to pause and allow for all the facts to be presented.
*  That you give me a chance and let the case play out as it should.
*  I firmly believe that when all the facts are presented, not only will I be exonerated,
*  but I still will be the New Jersey's senior senator.
*  He's confident that he will be exonerated.
*  Remember, prosecutors get it wrong sometimes.
*  And the facts have been presented in a way that are salacious by the federal prosecutors
*  and that it's really not that bad, guys.
*  And then he tried to explain the cash.
*  For 30 years, I have withdrawn thousands of dollars in cash from my personal savings account.
*  He said that it had become his habit to withdraw large sums of money to keep in his home.
*  Which I have kept for emergencies and because of the history of my family facing confiscation
*  in Cuba.
*  He sort of suggested without fully explaining that this was a habit that stemmed from his
*  parents' experience in Cuba.
*  They were both refugees from Cuba.
*  So he's basically denying it, but in a not very strident, almost kind of sheepish way.
*  I would say that's right.
*  I think even by raising it as an issue, he recognizes that it's going to be difficult
*  to explain that away.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Are you ready for the election?
*  Are you ready for the election?
*  Are you ready for the election?
*  Are you ready for the election?
*  Are you ready for the election?
*  Are you ready for the election?
*  So Tracy, stepping back a little here.
*  This is a man who already spent a number of years of his career fighting corruption charges,
*  even going to trial over them.
*  So it kind of mystifies me that he is accused of doing it again.
*  How do you explain that?
*  People were frankly gobsmacked by the timing and especially as laid out in the indictment.
*  The allegations are that within a month of being cleared by the Justice Department in
*  early 2018, he essentially, according to prosecutors, begins this corrupt scheme to accept bribes
*  for the benefit of the Egyptian government.
*  And it's just mind boggling, if true.
*  It appears almost reckless.
*  So soon after getting out from under earlier charges that took years of his life and to
*  throw himself headlong into this new scheme, it just, people were just scratching their
*  heads and saying, how is this even possible?
*  According to the indictment, it was Nadine and Hana that were the ones planning the meetings,
*  were the ones that were the go betweens with the Egyptian officials.
*  And I think there is a lot yet to be learned about how knowing Senator Menendez was, at
*  least in the beginning, about the true motive of the Egyptian officials.
*  Tracy, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Senator Menendez and his wife, Nadine, as well as their co-defendants, are scheduled
*  to be arraigned tomorrow morning at a federal courthouse in Manhattan.
*  All of them are expected to plead not guilty.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Monday, Ukraine's military claimed that it had killed the commander of Russia's Black
*  Sea Fleet in an audacious attack, which, if true, would represent a major blow to Russia's
*  Navy.
*  The Ukrainian attack, which involved a combination of missiles and exploding drones, targeted
*  a meeting of Russian military leaders on Friday at their headquarters in Crimea.
*  Video footage of the attack showed an airborne weapon plunging into the Russian headquarters
*  and then detonating.
*  The building was engulfed in debris and smoke.
*  Ukrainian officials say the attack killed 34 Russian officers and wounded dozens more,
*  including two senior Russian generals.
