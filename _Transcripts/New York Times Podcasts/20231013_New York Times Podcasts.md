*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverny-Sea, and this is the Daily.
*  In the weeks since Israel suffered the deadliest day in its history, fresh accounts have
*  emerged in village after village of just how extreme and how widespread the violence
*  actually was.
*  Today, the story of one man at the epicenter of that violence.
*  It's Friday, October 13th.
*  Hello.
*  Hi, Golan.
*  This is Sabrina Taverny-Sea from the Daily, from the New York Times Daily podcast.
*  Hi.
*  Hi.
*  Thank you for talking to us.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  I'm on my way to the, I think it's much quite a place I can find.
*  Great.
*  Perfect.
*  Thank you so much.
*  I know you must be absolutely exhausted.
*  Yeah, not easy.
*  Where are you right now?
*  We are all the community who are evacuated to an hotel in the Dead Sea, all the refugees
*  and all that is this place.
*  This is practically, I think, 90% of the hotel is people from my keyboards.
*  Golan, can you identify yourself for me, please?
*  Tell me your name, your age and where you live.
*  My name is Golan Abitbol.
*  And my age is 44.
*  I live in Kibbutzbury.
*  I was born in the Kibbutz.
*  The Kibbutz was established in 46.
*  It's older than the state of Israel.
*  And it's a quiet place surrounded by nature.
*  And I've been living there all my life with my family.
*  How many people in the Kibbutz?
*  We have like 1000 people in the Kibbutz.
*  We know each one of them by name because we lived with them since I was born and we know
*  the name of the kids.
*  We know everybody.
*  We all vouch for each other.
*  We all take care of each other.
*  And it's an amazing place to raise your kids in.
*  Do you have children?
*  I have four kids.
*  The older one is 15.
*  His sister is 14.
*  And my twin girls are nine.
*  Oh, twin girls.
*  Yeah.
*  And the kids are going freely.
*  They don't have any traffic inside the Kibbutz.
*  Just go send the kids to the grandparents on the other side of the Kibbutz.
*  And they can go and you don't worry because nothing bad can happen.
*  Goleun, I'm going to turn us now to the attack.
*  But first, I want you to tell me about Friday.
*  How did you spend the day before the attack began?
*  What was Friday like for you?
*  Friday morning in the morning.
*  I got up in Reykjavik, Iceland.
*  Oh, my goodness.
*  I woke up in Reykjavik, Iceland coming back from work and landed in Israel in about six
*  in the evening and two hours later, I was at home.
*  So this was my Friday.
*  And I saw my kids after a week.
*  I didn't saw them.
*  I spent time with them.
*  We ate dinner together.
*  I saw my friends.
*  We had some drinks and went to sleep like a normal Friday.
*  And then we woke up in about 6, 20 in the morning to the sound of launching missiles.
*  It was a huge, huge launch.
*  And I remember telling my wife what is going on, what is out of the blue.
*  We are on the border of Gaza.
*  We know what it's like to have a missile attacks.
*  We are used to it.
*  But this time it was weird.
*  It was suddenly and it was so intensive.
*  And a few minutes later, we got a text message.
*  We have an app of the community.
*  So we got a text that there is an invasion to the kibbutz and that we should lock
*  ourselves in the shelter.
*  In the second I got this message, I went to my safe and took my gun.
*  It's a pistol.
*  It's a small, nine millimeter pistol.
*  And it's what I have for personal defense.
*  So the first thing that felt right to do for me is to take the gun out and lock my family
*  in the shelter.
*  And then took a front position in the kitchen where I can have a better view of the neighborhood.
*  And if someone comes, I can respond and engage before they come to my house.
*  And next we started to wear shooting and we started to wear talks in Arabic.
*  And I was looking outside of the kitchen windows.
*  And then I saw in the outside parameter of my neighborhood, I saw some terrorist standing
*  outside with RPGs and heavy machine guns.
*  What did you think at that moment?
*  I knew it was bad.
*  And then I saw them exiting an apartment of one of my friends.
*  I saw three guys with a fighting vest with all the equipment, the gear and the helmets
*  and behind them three guys wearing civilian uniforms.
*  And they were exiting my neighbor apartment and it was horrible.
*  I didn't know what to do.
*  It was alive.
*  It's dead.
*  This kid.
*  I didn't know.
*  I just saw them exiting the apartment.
*  And then there was units starting entering the neighborhood.
*  I saw them going near one of the families and start shouting, sal, sal, like IDF, IDF
*  to make my neighbors think that they're from the IDF and they would give up and get
*  out.
*  To make your neighbors think they were actually from the Israeli military, that's the
*  IDF.
*  Yeah.
*  And this group were dressed like an Israeli police officers.
*  But something about the way they were dressed, they were, I don't know how to describe it,
*  a bit sloppy.
*  You know, it's not, it didn't felt right for me.
*  And I text my friend, I don't think it's the IDF, don't open the door.
*  And then I heard Arabic from really, really close.
*  And I saw from around the corner, turist, I saw them going towards my balcony.
*  I was standing at my post of the kitchen and I just saw them coming from around the corner.
*  I saw their face and you can see murder and died.
*  I saw them in their eyes.
*  They are going to kill my family.
*  I need to shoot now or else it's going to be my family.
*  It's now or never.
*  So I started shooting.
*  I gave a burst of five or six bullets towards them and they shot back.
*  My home's a shot with automatic weapons.
*  So then I'm shooting now from here and I'm going to a different position to shoot from
*  a different position because you don't fire twice from the same position.
*  So it will seem like there are more than one armed persons inside the house.
*  In Israel you join the army in the age of 18 and then you do a reserved duty until you
*  are about the age of 40.
*  So you don't think you act like a warrior.
*  You switch to a different mood and it's like a muscle memory.
*  And it's like a slow motion movie.
*  Everything is slow.
*  Everything is you see every move like slow.
*  And then you hear they're shooting back and then it's like a fast forward.
*  You jump to the floor and hide from the bullets.
*  So the time moves slowly and is suspended and then the time moves very quickly and speeds
*  up.
*  It's like a weird dream or something.
*  Yeah, I can wear a dream.
*  Do you remember feeling fear?
*  Yeah, of course.
*  Of course.
*  If you don't feel fear you are in any of it.
*  I felt fear and I felt fear for my family and my neighbors.
*  But the fear is set aside and now it's time to engage the enemy.
*  So then after several bursts of fire toward the balcony and toward the rest of the house
*  they shot the house from many positions.
*  But my family were in the safe room and the safe room can stand the heat of a missile.
*  So I wasn't worried about them.
*  It's okay.
*  Should the house as much as you like.
*  I'm on the floor.
*  It's okay now.
*  And then I don't know why they left.
*  They decided to go.
*  They went to a different house.
*  Then it's got quiet.
*  It's got quiet.
*  When I say quiet, I mean I didn't see any attackers, any terrorists outside.
*  You can always, always hear all the time the noise of weapons shooting outside.
*  I can hear them throwing grenades but I didn't see for like an hour or anyone else.
*  And then I heard one of my neighbors texting in the group of the neighborhood that they
*  are in his house and they are trying to break into the safe room.
*  But he was holding on to the liver so they want to be able to open the door.
*  Then I guess they got tired of trying to and they just set the house on fire.
*  And at first I didn't saw the fire.
*  Then I heard a weird noise, a weird unfamiliar noise of cracking stuff.
*  It seems like stuff is cracking, cracking wood.
*  And I looked outside and I saw all the top floor on fire.
*  And they started texting that the fire, the smoke is getting inside the safe room.
*  And in the Kibbutz text group they said, you need to put wet fabric on your mouth to
*  chill you from the smoke.
*  But the house is on fire and in certain time it wasn't safe for them anymore.
*  And I told them I don't see anyone outside from my position.
*  So they jumped to the ground level.
*  The family was the two kids and ran straight to the neighbor's house and got inside to
*  the safe room together within.
*  So the whole village was giving them instruction by text?
*  No, no, no.
*  The whole village was giving each other instruction.
*  We were all under attack, not only our neighborhood.
*  There were some neighborhoods closer to the eastern side, the side of Gaza, that were
*  heavily attacked, much heavier attacks than we got.
*  They got RPGs on their house, on the safe rooms.
*  And then in the text group, a daughter of one of my best friends just sent a recording
*  of hers.
*  She wasn't shouting.
*  She was whispering, help us.
*  My mother and brother are dying.
*  My father is hurt and he's dying.
*  They're trying to enter the house and he's on fire.
*  And she just kept on sending this kind of message.
*  And I know this girl.
*  And I know she's a good friend of my girls and she'd been to our house several times.
*  And I used to work with her father and we were one family.
*  We were like one family and I hear her recording, just help us, help us.
*  My father is dying.
*  My mother is already dead.
*  My older brother is lying dead and you feel helpless.
*  How old is she?
*  I think about 10 years old.
*  She had to see her parents critically injured in front of her eyes and just she couldn't
*  do anything.
*  And I couldn't do anything and no one could do anything.
*  Later on I heard they managed to rescue both of them after shooting with a tank because
*  they were a terrorist inside their home and they survived.
*  The girl is okay and their father just got out of surgery.
*  He lost his leg but he's alive with us.
*  Not like a lot of my friends.
*  But the rest of her family was killed.
*  The rest of her family was killed.
*  Golem, when did you finally leave the house and when did the police finally respond?
*  We heard a big noise, a really weird one and I opened the window to get a different
*  view and I saw tanks on the neighborhood.
*  It's not something you're supposed to see.
*  So I knew things are going to change but I don't know how long it's going to take.
*  And then a unit of the army came and took us out.
*  It was nighttime but we could see a lot.
*  To see the kibbutz burned to the ground.
*  It was horrible.
*  We could see the house of my neighbors.
*  Normally when you have a fire in the house the firefighters are coming and they put out
*  the fire but here I could see the fire dies out after burning everything.
*  We were encircled by their soldiers who kept us safe and took us.
*  And they told us to close the eyes of the young kids so they won't see the dead bodies
*  of the terrorists lying outside.
*  So they want to have this kind of memories in their mind.
*  They won't be scarred more than they are already scarred.
*  We went to the entrance of the kibbutz and they took us to the evacuation area.
*  And we were just about to go on a truck, an army truck to evacuate us.
*  And then from the bushes one of the terrorists just started shooting at us with no cover.
*  And we had to lie on my kids and protect them, my twins.
*  I had to shelter them with my body and shout to my kids.
*  I lost my two grown-up kids.
*  I shout to them, where are you?
*  It seems like forever but they killed the terrorists very quickly.
*  The soldiers and no one was injured.
*  What time was that approximately?
*  Do you have any sense of that?
*  That was 10 o'clock at night, 10'30, when we left the perimeter.
*  And it began in six in the morning.
*  That is so many hours.
*  That's eternity.
*  It's, I just can't describe the feeling.
*  It just feels like an eternity.
*  And later on we were evacuated to the hotel in the Dead Sea, where we are now.
*  Did anybody in your neighborhood die?
*  We don't know.
*  We don't know.
*  We get drips by drips of names.
*  And today all the grown-ups in the community got inside the conference room of the hotel.
*  And they were sitting there, some members of the community with Denise.
*  And they were starting to read the names of the people we know are dead.
*  And each one of the members got the page and start reading like 10 names.
*  And then collapse back and then the other one next to him stands and start reading some more names.
*  And sit back and like, I don't know how many.
*  I don't know how many I couldn't count.
*  And then I know each one of them.
*  I know each one of them and they read the names.
*  And they they paused and said, now we are going to read the names of the people we don't know where they are.
*  And it was just as long.
*  A good friend of mine.
*  She was, they broke into her safe room.
*  They pulled her out, she and their kids.
*  And they told them to sit outside.
*  And they took all the men and the boys from this group, put them on a truck and just went to Gaza.
*  And they took her son is the best friend of my son.
*  He's 16 years old and he's the most adorable gentle kid and just ripped him away from the hands of his mother.
*  And my son is devastated and we are all devastated.
*  And we don't know what happened to our family.
*  We don't know what happened to our friends.
*  We know that they killed one out of ten of our community.
*  One out of ten is dead.
*  But a lot more were taken.
*  They took babies, they took kids, they took elderly people.
*  Eight years old woman.
*  She was like my grandmother.
*  I know her from the day I was born and she was like my grandmother and we were laughing together like two weeks ago.
*  And now she took her.
*  Why?
*  They're not human beings.
*  They're not human beings.
*  Human beings couldn't do this kind of, they are vicious killers.
*  They are not freedom fighters.
*  They're not fighting to liberate their country.
*  And our community donated every year money to some people who used to work in the kibbutz.
*  These are people from Gaza.
*  People from Gaza, they were our friends and we donated money to them.
*  The mother of a friend of mine was kidnapped.
*  She used to go once a week to one of the border crossing with Gaza Strip and pick up with her car, children and take them to get dialysis in Israeli hospitals.
*  And now she's in Gaza.
*  We are liberal person.
*  We don't believe that all of the people in Gaza are evil.
*  We don't believe, we didn't believe.
*  I'm sorry.
*  We didn't believe.
*  I don't know what I'm thinking now.
*  I don't know what to think now because we always saw that peace and negotiation is the solution.
*  And I don't think anyone think now we lost our faith.
*  We don't think there could be any kind of reason to talk with these animals that destroyed my kibbutz.
*  Kidnapped my family and we want them back.
*  We can't be a community without them.
*  They are part of us.
*  It's like a jigsaw puzzle.
*  You can't take one piece and it will be okay.
*  The ones that dead are gone.
*  Okay, but we need them.
*  We need the ones that survive.
*  Get my neighbors back.
*  I want them back.
*  They are my friends.
*  They are my family.
*  I want them back.
*  And I go in the hotel and it's like a roller coaster of emotions.
*  Because I hear someone just died and it breaks my heart and I collapse.
*  And second later I see someone arriving that I was sure that he was dead and was afraid to ask.
*  And then another one is dead and another one alive and it's a roller coaster of emotions.
*  What are the children like in the hotel?
*  How are your nine-year-old daughters?
*  My twins are playing.
*  They talked to a psychiatrist and they didn't saw anything.
*  They heard the noise of the shooting but they didn't saw the terrorist.
*  They didn't saw the bodies.
*  My older kids saw the bodies.
*  They know about their friends that were kidnapped and they know about their friends that were slaughtered.
*  They know.
*  And there will never be kids again.
*  Their childhood is over.
*  And I know my son will never be the same again.
*  His childhood is over.
*  His friends are dead or gone in Gaza and now we need to start to rebuild our lives from scratch.
*  And from the moment we arrived here we rebuilt infrastructure of the community.
*  This person who in charge of finding people place to sleep in.
*  Someone who is in charge of activities for the kids and we have a person who is in charge of the elderly persons.
*  And the nurse of the kibbutz is in charge of getting people their medicines that they left back at home.
*  We rebuilt our community here in the hotel.
*  So we could survive the day to come because we don't know how long we are going to be here.
*  We don't know if we have a place to go back to.
*  I don't know if my home is still standing.
*  I don't know.
*  And it's still under army quarantine.
*  So we can't go back home.
*  We are here like refugees.
*  So for now I'm still in the hotel and trying to hold on.
*  Trying to go on one day at a time.
*  Do you feel that it changed you?
*  I'm sorry, Dean.
*  I always say I was scratched already before with all the military service I've been through.
*  But this is a different kind of scratch.
*  So many friends of mine died.
*  So many.
*  When half of your friend died,
*  there is no coming back.
*  You are not, I'm not going to be the same person as before.
*  I'm trying to keep my humor as much as I can.
*  But none of us are going to be the same again.
*  My kids are not going to be the same again.
*  I'm not going to be the same again.
*  None of us.
*  Israel is not going to be the same again.
*  We went to a second Holocaust and unfortunately I did a fertility to be in the front line.
*  We're not going to be the same.
*  The death toll from the weekends attack in Israel stands at 1,200 people, among them were at least 25 Americans.
*  In Gaza, at least 1,537 people, including 500 children,
*  have been killed in airstrikes that Israel has conducted in retaliation for the attack.
*  And late Thursday night, Israel's military told the United Nations that the entire population
*  of Northern Gaza, about 1,000,000 people, should relocate to the southern half of the territory
*  in 24 hours.
*  The UN said it had strongly appealed for the order to be rescinded,
*  to avoid making, quote, what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what Altus should know today.
*  The House of Representatives was once again left without any prospect for a leader,
*  when Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana withdrew his name for consideration for the
*  speakership, late on Thursday.
*  Scalise was nominated for the role on Wednesday, but he failed to muster enough votes to be elected,
*  because hard-line Republicans balked at supporting him.
*  Instead, they threw their weight behind his challenger,
*  Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the right-wing Republican endorsed by former President Donald Trump.
*  The surprise move left the House Republican caucus in chaos, with no clear end in sight.
*  Scalise said he would step aside in hopes that someone else could unite the fractious party.
