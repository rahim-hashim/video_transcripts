*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro. This is Adali.
*  In overturning Rue vs. Wade last year, the Supreme Court's message was that it was done
*  with the issue of abortion. It wasn't. Today, Adam Littak, on the case that is forcing
*  the High Court to weigh in on abortion all over again.
*  It's Wednesday, April 19.
*  So, Adam, here we are once again. You and me talking about abortion,
*  and the Supreme Court. Right. And I thought when we talked about the big decision in
*  June and Dobs overturning Rue vs. Wade, that the Supreme Court had made us a promise that
*  it was getting out of the abortion business and that the fight over abortion would now
*  be political, not legal. Right. And yet, this issue has already made its way back
*  up to the Supreme Court. So, tell us why that has happened.
*  So, opponents of abortion, one, of course, an enormous victory last June. And the
*  upshot of that victory was that Rue vs. Wade was overturned, and in much of the country,
*  abortion became illegal, but not in all of the country. And opponents of abortion wanted
*  to be legal nowhere, and they hit upon a strategy to go after the most common method of abortion
*  in places where it's still legal, which is the use of abortion pills, notably one called
*  Miffepristone. Right. A drug that, as we've explained on the show in the past, is used
*  in about half of all abortions in the U.S. But remind us how exactly these anti-abortion
*  groups try to go after this drug? Well, some groups of doctors and individual doctors who
*  oppose abortion go into federal court in Amarillo, Texas. They do a bit of judge shopping.
*  There's only one judge in Amarillo, Texas, federal judge, Matthew Kazmerich. And they make
*  the argument to him that the Food and Drug Administration, 23 years ago in 2000, had
*  relied on bad science to approve this drug, and that the judge should step in and take
*  the extraordinary step of suspending the approval of this abortion bill. Right. These groups
*  want this medicine off the market entirely, and they think this is the judge who's going
*  to make that happen. Right. And the old is a hearing. Here's the arguments. And a little
*  while later issues precisely the decision, opponents of abortion, we're hoping for, saying
*  that suspend the availability of the drug. And his decision is widely criticized. Many
*  people think it's flawed. And why exactly? Where to begin? There's a very significant
*  question about whether these abortion opponents had legal standing to sue, whether they
*  themselves had suffered the sort of direct and concrete injury that gives them standing
*  to sue. Their claim is that some of them are emergency room doctors. And some of them
*  might someday be in an emergency room where the rare thing of a complication induced by
*  this abortion bill causes a woman to have to go to an emergency room. And they will
*  have to treat that woman and they won't want to do that. And that chain of causation
*  legal experts say does not satisfy ordinary understandings of standing. Because it's
*  very theoretical rather than a case being brought by people who have actually suffered
*  the harm. Right. And there are Supreme Court cases that say as much that even a statistically
*  likely prospect of future harm doesn't do it. Okay. So a shaky start. What else about
*  the decision is considered less than pristine? There's a statute of limitations for challenges
*  to drugs of six years. The drug was approved in 2000. And I'm not great at math, but 23 is
*  larger than six. It is. So there's a real statute of limitations problem. And then there's
*  the largest problem of all, a conceptual problem about who should be making the decisions
*  about whether drugs are safe and effective. We have on the one hand an expert agency, the
*  Food and Drug Administration, which has gone through extensive study and approved the drug.
*  And on the other hand, we have a federal judge in Texas who is reevaluating that evidence
*  for himself, although as far as I know, he has no particular scientific training. And
*  he's also relying on some studies that critics have real problems with, including collections
*  of blog posts. So it does not seem to be peer reviewed science we're getting here. But
*  nonetheless, Judge Matthew Kesmerich comes to the conclusion that the FDA was wrong in
*  the year 2000 to approve this drug. So in multiple meaningful ways, this Texas federal
*  judge is ruling feels shaky, maybe even a little bit shoddy, but here it is. He's a federal
*  judge. His ruling has consequences. So what happens next?
*  Well, the judge had some choices about what to do about his decision while the inevitable
*  appeals were going to happen. He could have put the decision on pause to give the litigants
*  and higher courts ample time in a deliberate way to consider whether his ruling was right
*  or not. Instead, he gives the world a seven day deadline. His ruling is going to come into
*  effect in a week unless a higher court does something to stop it.
*  And that thing that will happen in just a week is that Mifipristone would be taken off
*  the market, a very serious, very significant change.
*  Yes, it would cause chaos in the marketplace.
*  And so what is the reaction to this very aggressive timetable from this Texas judge?
*  There's reaction all over the place. This is a breathtaking example of judicial aggressiveness.
*  First of all, the decision itself is the subject of really harsh criticism from across the
*  ideological spectrum.
*  The ruling reads like somebody who is an anti-abortion activist.
*  I think there are problems with the judge's ruling, but I believe that's because of his religious
*  beliefs. I think he simply made traditional errors.
*  There's a reaction from the pharmaceutical industry.
*  More than 600 drug makers and biotech leaders signing on to a scathing condemnation of that
*  ruling by a federal judge in Texas, which is terrified not only about the subortion bill.
*  If one medicine is subject to this kind of outcome, really any medicine is.
*  But about the idea that judges all across America are going to be second-guessing the FDA's
*  approval of other drugs.
*  Providers are once again scrambling at issue use of a key abortion medication after two conflicting
*  court opinions.
*  There is also on the same night that the Texas judge rules are ruling from a judge in Washington
*  state that goes in precisely the opposite direction and says that in 17 states and a district
*  of Columbia, the FDA may not suspend approval of the drug, must keep the drug in place.
*  Now the two competing rulings set up a high-stakes legal showdown that's likely to end up before
*  the U.S. Supreme Court.
*  So now there's contradictory rulings in the land.
*  The Biden administration immediately goes to an appeals court, the U.S. Court of Appeals
*  for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans.
*  Today, the Justice Department appealed a federal judge's ruling asking for an emergency
*  stay.
*  And says, please stop that seven-day deadline.
*  Please let us litigate this in an orderly fashion.
*  And how does the Fifth Circuit respond?
*  So the question before the Fifth Circuit is what to do while the appeal goes forward.
*  And to the surprise of almost everybody, it issues a kind of mixed decision.
*  It says we're not going to go back to 2000.
*  That's too far back.
*  The statute of limitations has passed.
*  We are going to maintain the FDA's approval of the drug and we're not going to recreate
*  the world before 2000 where this drug was not yet approved as safe and effective.
*  But we are going to go back to 2016.
*  And in 2016 and in later years, the FDA gradually expanded access to the drug.
*  It made it available up through 10 weeks of pregnancy versus the original seven.
*  It required fewer visits to a doctor in allowed other healthcare professionals to prescribe
*  it and it allowed the drug to be mailed.
*  All of that, the Fifth Circuit said, could be suspended.
*  So they didn't take the world back to 2000, but they took the world back to 2016.
*  So I'm just to be sure I understand.
*  Whereas the Texas judge during this interim period wants to roll back the clock on
*  Mifor Person all the way back to 2000 to a world before the FDA even approves the
*  drug, the Fifth Circuit says, no, something more modest is in order.
*  We're going to roll back the clock to before 2016 when access to the drug was expanded.
*  So the world we're going to be living in right now is going to be one where Mifor Person
*  is available, but just not as available as it has been.
*  That's right.
*  And I suppose the Fifth Circuit thought that was a compromise of some sort, but not everyone
*  agreed.
*  I'm curious, Adam.
*  What do you make of the fact that we now in this legal saga have two federal courts, one
*  of the district level, the other on the appeals level, going outside what in your description
*  is the typical path of leaving access to a drug like this untouched as a case winds its
*  way through the system.
*  So let me start by saying that there's almost nothing typical about this case.
*  And this is the first time to anyone's knowledge that a court has overruled the FDA's approval
*  of any drug of any kind, right, and not to be simple minded about it, but at least some
*  legal observers note that the Texas judge and the judges in the majority in the Fifth
*  Circuit were all appointed by Donald Trump, who had vowed to appoint judges who were
*  prepared to overrul Roe v Wade and who were opposed to abortion.
*  Got it.
*  So against that backdrop, what Adam happens next?
*  Well the Biden administration can't live with this supposed compromise from the Fifth
*  Circuit and it goes to the Supreme Court.
*  The Supreme Court that just last June said that it was getting out of the abortion business,
*  but that turned out to be wrong.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Adam, what does the Supreme Court, which as you said, doesn't really want to have
*  to be involved in this kind of a case, but now has had its hand forced?
*  What does it do?
*  Well, Michael, remember that one week pause that the judge in Texas imposed just as Samuel
*  Lino says he's going to extend that pause just for a couple days to give the Supreme Court
*  enough time to read briefs to get on top of the lower court decisions and make a decision
*  and he sets a new deadline tonight at midnight.
*  Got it.
*  So what exactly will we know by midnight tonight?
*  What is the scope of what we expect the Supreme Court to decide given all these conflicting
*  cases and this legal saga that has led us to this point?
*  So let me start by saying the Supreme Court can do whatever it likes, but I'll tell you
*  what the likely outcomes are.
*  One thing the court's not going to do tonight is decide on the merits of whether Judge
*  Kets Merrick was right or wrong.
*  The court will almost certainly get to that question down the line, maybe months from now.
*  For now, all the court is going to decide is what happens in the meantime while the case
*  goes forward.
*  And it can basically do one of three things.
*  One is to say that the status quo we've lived with for 23 years remains in place and the
*  pill remains available.
*  The other is to say as the fifth circuit did that the relaxed standards after 2016 go away,
*  but the pill is mostly available.
*  And the third is to say that while the case goes forward, access to the pill is suspended
*  and abortion becomes even more difficult to obtain in the United States.
*  Got it.
*  This is of course a Supreme Court whose conservative majority is inclined to oppose abortion.
*  I don't think there's any debate about that.
*  But as you hinted at earlier, in its biggest ruling of all on abortion made clear that
*  it wants elected officials to be deciding access to abortion rather than the judiciary issuing
*  a kind of one-size-fits-all nationwide policy.
*  So which of these three outcomes that you just went through seems most consistent with
*  this Supreme Court's approach to abortion?
*  Well if we take the court at its word in Dobs, it claimed to be scrupulously neutral
*  about abortion.
*  It was in pro-abortion, it was an anti-abortion.
*  It just said the Constitution has nothing to say about it and the court was going to stay
*  out of things.
*  If that vow is to be taken seriously, you would think the court would defer to the expert
*  agency in this area and its review of the science and certainly just while the case proceeds
*  allow access to the pill to continue.
*  So basically leave it as it was post 2016, full access to this pill at least in the states
*  where abortion remains legal.
*  That's what the logic of Dobs would suggest, but of course at least some of the justices
*  may have been animated not by scrupulous neutrality toward abortion but by actual opposition to
*  abortion.
*  So I might expect a split decision with the most conservative justices, justices Clarence
*  Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, maybe off on one end.
*  The three liberal justices, justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Katanji Brown-Jackson
*  off on the other end.
*  And then the middle of the court being decisive, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Brett
*  Kavanaugh and Justice Amy Coney Barrett.
*  And I think some coalition of the liberals plus the Chief Justice plus Justice Kavanaugh
*  might be enough to maintain for the time being the status quo allowing unfettered access
*  to the pill as we've had since 2000.
*  And let's presume at him that your prediction here is correct and a coalition of liberal
*  and conservative justices comes together and ensures unfettered access to Mifipristone
*  for now.
*  What will that tell us about how the justices are likely to rule on this even larger and
*  more consequential question of whether this Texas judges ruling has merit, that the FDA
*  was wrong when it approved this drug back in 2000 and that it should be banned?
*  So they're not the same questions.
*  They don't involve identical legal standards, but nonetheless as a practical matter, the
*  vote on this initial question will be powerfully predictive of the vote on the ultimate question,
*  meaning that if I'm right and we'll find out soon enough, abortion opponents are likely
*  in the short term but also in the long term to suffer a setback, but it's important to
*  consider the context.
*  They want a huge victory on a constitutional question in the DOBS decision.
*  This is a different question.
*  The question of administrative law, it was a very ambitious claim to begin with.
*  They found a sympathetic judge who produced an optically satisfying opinion and they
*  can't have been all that confident that they could ultimately win on the merits of this
*  case.
*  And whatever the justices' sympathies are on abortion, they also have some commitment to
*  judicial craftsmanship and maintaining commitments to legal doctrines like standing and the
*  statute of limitations and how administrative law works.
*  And legal experts say that judge cat's merits opinion flunked all of that and the fifth
*  circuit's opinion was a little better.
*  So while people have lost a lot of faith in the Supreme Court, they still hope and expect
*  that a majority of the justices are committed to neutral legal principles that would make
*  this kind of case difficult to sustain.
*  So these two questions of what to do about Mithra Prashton both in the short term and
*  the long term could ultimately reveal the limits of this Supreme Court's conservatism when
*  it comes to abortion.
*  There may be a place that it just won't go.
*  Yeah, I mean, there are outcomes that many of the justices might like, but they need
*  to have a pathway to those outcomes that looks like law and art politics.
*  And this doesn't look like that pathway.
*  No, it doesn't.
*  And while the court is full of surprises, this is a moment in time when it's in the midst
*  of a legitimacy crisis.
*  It's public approval ratings have plummeted.
*  There are almost daily revelations about apparent ethics violations notably by Justice
*  Clarence Thomas.
*  And it's probably not the moment for them to endorse legal theories that all kinds of
*  serious people, conservatives and liberals both think are borderline crazy and would
*  do more than affect abortions.
*  It would undermine the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to set national standards
*  for safe and effective drugs.
*  It would allow anybody with an objection to a vaccine or something else to go into court
*  and have a single federal district judge untrained in science to second guess the approvals of the
*  expert agency.
*  So just as the FDA does a cost benefit analysis of whether to approve a drug or not, the
*  court has to do a kind of cost benefit analysis too.
*  It may like a particular result, but it has to think of the cost of the collateral consequences.
*  And the consequences here would be enormous.
*  Right.
*  Because the cost might not just be the court's legitimacy in the eyes of many Americans
*  because it would be endorsing what looks like an ideologically driven, legally shaky ruling
*  on a subject that court has said it doesn't want to touch anymore.
*  It could also imperil an enormous component of the American health care system.
*  And those are two costs that might make the justices inclined to show some real restraint
*  here.
*  So this is a court that is assertive and ambitious and has an agenda.
*  And that agenda may even include trying to further restrict abortion, not withstanding
*  what seemed to be a promise in the DOBS decision.
*  But even so, you would think these are sensible, able judges who would want to pick their shots.
*  And maybe not in this particular case where there are the questions you've raised, Michael,
*  take an enormous step at the cost of imperiling its prestige, authority, legitimacy in an
*  era where it's under all kinds of scrutiny and assault.
*  Well Adam, as always, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know day.
*  In a dramatic and surprise ending to what was expected to be a blockbuster defamation
*  trial, Fox News reached a nearly $800 million settlement with Dominion voting systems, which
*  had accused the network of knowingly spreading false claims about its role in election fraud
*  in the 2020 election.
*  The last minute settlement was announced after a jury had been selected and opening statements
*  from both sides were about to start.
*  Dominion had originally demanded $1.6 billion from Fox.
*  Even with a settlement that fell short of that, Dominion's lawyers called the outcome
*  a major victory for the company and the truth.
*  Today's settlement of $787,500,000 represents vindication and accountability.
*  Lies have consequences.
*  The truth does not know red or blue.
*  On Tuesday, a Russian court rejected an effort by a Wall Street Journal reporter to end
*  his detention while he awaits trial on charges of espionage that both his employer and the
*  US government say are entirely baseless.
*  The rejection came during a hearing in which the reporter, Evan Gerskivich, appeared in
*  public for the first time since his arrest.
*  His detention, the first time a Western journalist has been charged with espionage since the Cold
*  War, has brought relations between the United States and Russia to a new low.
