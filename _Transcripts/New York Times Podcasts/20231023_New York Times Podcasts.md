*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Borrow. This is The Daily.
*  On Friday, the U.S. government reported that over the past year, the federal deficit,
*  the gap between what the U.S. spent and what it earned, doubled to nearly $2 trillion.
*  That figure seems to validate the worries of congressional Republicans about government spending,
*  which have been at the center of the messy fight over who should be House Speaker.
*  But as my colleague Jim Tancersley explains, the Republicans' plans will come close to solving
*  the problem.
*  It's Monday, October 23rd.
*  So Jim, $2 trillion, we now know, is our deficit for just the last year.
*  And I'm not an economist. That seems like a huge number. And I'd like you to put that
*  into perspective.
*  It's a big deficit. It's twice the size of the deficit last year. So a big jump. It's
*  only the third time in American history when we've had a $2 trillion deficit. And the
*  first two were in the depths of the pandemic. And we're in a really different economic place
*  than we were. Those last $2 trillion deficits were not just reopening from the pandemic.
*  We're back. And usually when an economy is growing rapidly like our economy has been
*  over the last year, deficits go down. But this one did not.
*  Now Jim, deficits are always a tricky subject. Republicans talk about it now all the time.
*  In fact, they have put it at the center of this chaotic speakership fight that they're
*  now having. Yet you have trained us through many long conversations to understand that
*  deficits aren't necessarily that big of a deal. So how much should we really care about
*  this $2 trillion number?
*  I think we should care a lot. And people I know, smart people who I talk to for my stories
*  who have for a long time said, don't worry about deficits. Don't worry too much about
*  deficits are starting to worry more. And it's because of two big changes in circumstances.
*  We update our views based on the information that changes around us. The first big change
*  is that you don't normally run big deficits when the economy is growing. And so that's
*  an alarm bell in itself. Historically, when you get growth, what happens is that the government
*  brings in more taxes because people are earning more money and spending more money. And
*  the deficit usually goes down, but not here. Right. But the second reason why a lot of
*  economists worry about the deficit right now, when maybe they worried even a few months
*  ago, is how much it's costing the country all of a sudden to borrow all this money we
*  need to cover the deficit.
*  Borrowing costs for the federal government have shot up in the last few months. And if
*  they stay high, that is going to become this sort of feedback loop for deficits. We pay
*  a lot more on interest. And therefore, we have to borrow more to pay the interest. And
*  that could become a really bad cycle for the government in the economy.
*  You're describing a kind of financial double whammy that sounds very grim. I want to get
*  to the root causes of these two changed circumstances you're describing. The fact that
*  our deficit doubled despite healthy economy and the fact that our borrowing costs to make
*  up for that deficit have grown so quickly. So let's start with why our deficit got so
*  big in the past year.
*  The biggest reason is the amount of tax revenue that we brought in last year as a country
*  was just way down, down by like 9%. Why was that? Well, we cut a bunch of taxes over
*  the last couple of decades. That includes the Trump tax cuts which passed in 2017. But
*  we knew about those Trump tax cuts. We knew they were going to hold down revenues. And
*  revenues still came in lower than forecasters expected. And that was because of all sorts
*  of weird little reasons. Capital gains taxes. Like what happens when you sell a stock?
*  They went way down. Tariffs revenue went down. We just bought less stuff imported from
*  other countries. There were natural disasters all over the country that caused the IRS
*  to change some tax filing deadlines for like people in California. And so they didn't have
*  to pay certain taxes before the end of the fiscal year. All of that added up to this
*  huge drop in tax revenues.
*  So the big thing that happened here is that we took in a heck of a lot less tax money
*  than we did the year before. But as we all know, deficit happened when our spending outstrips
*  our tax revenue. So I'm curious, did we spend a lot more even as this tax revenue fell
*  by what I think we said 9%. It's not a secret we're spending a lot of money right now
*  in this country. For example, on the war in Ukraine, we're about to spend even more
*  money on the war in Israel. Is that a factor in this deficit?
*  Actually not a very big one. Spending didn't actually go up very much last year, even
*  with what we spent in Ukraine. I know Republicans like to talk about this a lot, but this type
*  of sort of emergency defense spending aid to foreign countries is mostly short term.
*  And it's not very big in the context of the overall budget and certainly not very
*  big in the context of our long haul budget problems. So spending didn't go up by nearly
*  as much as tax revenues fell. The big driver here is taxes. It's that surprisingly big
*  drop in tax revenue.
*  Okay. Clearly we have a tax problem. Now Jim walk us through this second big change
*  you alluded to before that compounds this problem, the high cost of borrowing money to fill
*  our deficit gap.
*  Okay. So when the government takes in less money in tax revenue, then it needs to spend
*  on government services. It has to borrow the money. And there's a way that it borrows
*  the money. It issues bonds, treasury bonds. Yep. And when interest rates are low in
*  the economy, which they have been for a really long time since the 2008 financial crisis,
*  the cost of borrowing for the government is not very much. It's able to sort of to go
*  out, get a bunch of money, not have to worry about paying a lot more back. And so the total
*  interest costs that it's paying as part of its budget are low. But now what's happened
*  is the interest rate of a 10 year treasury bond has been hovering right around 5%, which
*  is significantly higher than we've experienced in recent years. If it stays at 5% for a long
*  time, that means significantly higher interest costs for the government, which means it's going
*  to need to borrow more money to pay those costs. So basically, it sounds like the government
*  is facing the same financial scenario that everybody else in America is facing right now, which
*  is higher interest rates on their loans to buy a car, to buy a house. If you want to go
*  buy a house right now, instead of paying 2%, 3%, which you did a decade ago, you're paying
*  5 or even more percent. And it sucks. Right. It's really rough for the government's balance
*  sheet. That's a lot to be paying an interest at a time when you're going to have mounting interest
*  costs and mounting deficits anyway. Okay. So just walk us through what the world looks like for
*  a country with as much deficit as we have and a 5% interest rate cost of borrowing.
*  So last year, we're by the way, interest rates were not 5% for all of last year. They were lower
*  for a while than they jumped in recent months. But last year, the federal government spent $659
*  billion just to pay interest on the national debt just for interest. Wow. And if rates stay at 5%,
*  that number is going to go way up. Right. And that's a tremendous amount of money to have to take
*  out of the economy just to pay interest. I'm thinking of all the good that money could do if we
*  didn't have to spend it on interest on debt, perhaps it could be used to build a bridge, infrastructure,
*  technology, childcare, whatever, something else that would benefit a lot of people.
*  So yeah, this is one of the worries about higher interest costs is that that interest cost starts to
*  what's called crowd out other spending. So maybe we can't build more bridges because we have to
*  pay this interest or maybe we have to reduce Medicaid benefits and healthcare to people who
*  really need it. The big worry is that if Congress doesn't want to get into this ongoing big spiral
*  of bigger deficits and higher borrowing costs and more and more of the federal budget going to
*  pay interest on the debt, lawmakers are going to have to make some pretty tough choices about taxes
*  and spending. And I don't know if you've been watching Congress lately, but they are not exactly
*  really good right now at making tough choices or any choices or any choices. But let alone truly tough
*  choices. Right.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Jim, we just agreed that it's a tough time in Washington to confront the financial challenges
*  we're talking about. But I do want to pause to note that Republicans in their own very complicated
*  and to many people dysfunctional way are talking a lot about deficits spending and debt right now.
*  So I want to talk through that and make sense of how Republicans and in a few moments, Democrats
*  are thinking about the scale of the deficit in this moment and these higher borrowing costs.
*  Yeah, let's start with the Republicans. Republicans have been mourning for more than a decade
*  that America's deficits were too high and that we needed to bring them down with the exception
*  of when Republicans were president. And that is an important thing to keep in mind here. They passed
*  a large tax cut under President Trump and deficits went up and they didn't complain in the way they
*  are complaining now. With some exceptions, there are some Republican fiscal hawks who have complained
*  throughout in a bipartisan fashion. But those Republicans who do talk about deficits and have sort
*  of consistently over the years, what they're really talking about is reducing spending levels and the
*  size of government. They don't want to increase revenues. They want to reduce the amount
*  that the government is spending and what those Republicans who are clamoring about deficits
*  are talking most about is a very particular type of spending, which is non-defense discretionary
*  spending. Just to find out. And it includes a bunch of things that are like fairly popular,
*  national parks, the Department of Education, and you know, other things keeping the business of
*  the government running today today. Pretty small in the context of a budget that also includes
*  national security and large social programs like Social Security and Medicare. And so here's the
*  way that I think about it. If the deficit is sort of a leak in the whole of our national
*  budgetary boat that is growing over time, you could think of non-defense discretionary as the
*  rain falling on the deck. And not where the water is really coming into the boat. There is water
*  coming in. It's not the big driver. You could cut it to zero and still not solve the problem. So
*  you could stop the rain. The hole is still going to be there. And I think if all you're focused on
*  is these cuts that they would like to see in discretionary spending, you're not anywhere close to
*  making a dent in the problem. And the best sort of hope you would have as one of the advocates of
*  that plan is that you've taken a meaningful first step. But it is not a solution and they're not
*  arguing over an actual way to change the course meaningfully of the national debt. That's really
*  helpful context. So what about Democrats and President Biden? How do they talk about these deficits
*  and the borrowing costs and the threat of the two of them interacting in all the ways that everyone
*  now fears? If I'm being honest, I don't feel like Democrats as a party talk all that much about
*  the deficit. Yeah, the Biden administration has been really tough to pin down on this. The president
*  and his advisors won't tell you exactly what they think the ideal deficit number should be. They
*  just say they want it to be fiscally sustainable. Like they're not trying to balance the budget over time.
*  None of their proposals have done that. But they do think that we need more tax revenue over time
*  to make that sustainability happen. So what they've settled on is proposing deficit reduction with
*  things they think voters will really like. Like what? That's mostly raising taxes on corporations
*  and rich people. In short, Democrats mostly want to reduce deficits by raising taxes at the top.
*  And Republicans entirely want to reduce the deficit by cutting spending. You've already said
*  that the Republican plan isn't really up to the scale of the problem. Is the Democratic plan,
*  potentially the tax plan, up to the scale of the problem? Very few budget experts think that's
*  possible entirely with tax increases on the rich. And certainly the amount of tax increases that
*  the president has proposed now is probably nowhere close to enough to actually stabilize the debt
*  and deficits in a world where borrowing costs stay really high. Got it. So what the world really needs
*  is some sort of a goldilocks solution that takes the Democrats instincts perhaps to raise taxes
*  and marries it to the Republican instincts to cut spending. And this is where we get into the
*  real hard choices problem. The sort of think tank industry around stabilizing the budget in
*  Washington basically agrees that you need a mix of two things to stabilize deficits.
*  The first is some tax increases which Republicans refuse to do. And the second is a thing that President
*  Biden has unilaterally ruled out. All Democrats basically rule out. And most Republicans also rule
*  out including former President Trump, which is reducing government spending on Social Security and
*  Medicare. The big and title of programs. Right. And so that's what the fiscal hawks say. Hey,
*  we need to make some changes over time. We can raise some taxes. We can reduce some benefits and
*  that's the goldilocks solution. But in this case, it's like everybody hates goldilocks. And so
*  it's going to be a very difficult, I mean, it's just a very difficult conversation for Washington
*  to even start having about the actual drivers of debt when seemingly tax increases are off the table.
*  And so are the big spending programs that are responsible for the big projected growth and
*  spending in the years to come. Well, when was the last time we got even close to this goldilocks
*  style solution? Yeah. So the last time we had a fiscal trajectory that got itself not just to
*  stabilize deficits, but an actual balanced budget was this magical time you might remember
*  Michael called the 1990s. Oh, yes. I was running because I thought we ought to change the
*  direction of the country. I was worried about the decline in middle class incomes, the growth of
*  the underclass and exploding deficit at the declining level of investment. Bill Clinton was
*  president. And first he and Democrats raised some taxes. And then when Republicans took over the
*  house of representatives, Clinton worked with them and agreed on some spending cuts.
*  Seems to me that a lot of our problems are not particularly partisan in nature. Clinton would
*  make a point about this. Having said that, I'd like to now bring the speaker on, let him say a
*  word or two, and then we'll get on with your questions. Mr. Speaker. Early on, he even did a town hall
*  with the Republican speaker of the house, New Gingrich, to just talk about how they were going to
*  bring down the deficit together. I believe in this process working with the president with the
*  house and the Senate with the governors. I believe we can get to a balanced budget in a positive
*  way, but it's got to be done exactly like here today. So I hope with your permission, the president,
*  I will now have a dialogue with you and maybe the president. And then we got a bunch of great
*  economic growth and all of that combined to actually balancing the budget for several years at
*  the end of the 90s. Right. A truly balanced budget. Same money coming in as went out. Yes.
*  For the kids out there, it once happened. It once happened. And I think really crucially,
*  the sort of engine behind Clinton's efforts to do that was an actual economic theory that has
*  now become associated with the guy who was his Treasury Secretary, Robert Rubin. Rubinomics.
*  And the idea of Rubinomics was, if you can reduce the deficit and maybe even balance the budget,
*  then you can actually stoke more economic growth. And you do that because lower deficits help to
*  relieve pressure on interest rates. They can help interest rates fall in the economy. And the idea
*  being lower interest rates mean more people borrow money to buy houses or cars or whatever. There's
*  more economic activity. Right. You can get a growth bang for deficit reduction. And that theory
*  totally fell out of favor among Democrats in particular in the last couple of decades. Why?
*  Because economic conditions changed. Interest rates were low. And there wasn't going to be much of a
*  bang for deficit reduction in reducing rates that were basically zero across the economy.
*  But now that they're climbing again, now that that 10-year Treasury is back around 5%,
*  you start to hear some whispers from some people around Washington about could Rubinomics
*  make a comeback? Could Democrats, Republicans work together to reduce the deficit and by bringing
*  down the deficit sort of stoke more growth and lower the cost of all that borrowing? And lower the
*  cost of all that borrowing exactly. And so I'm not saying we're there yet, but there is speculation
*  that we may be nearing another one of these Rubinite moments where a reduced deficit could help
*  grow the economy and create sort of a virtuous cycle where more growth helps bring down the
*  deficit further in the future. Right. And government money is freed up to do the kinds of things we
*  were talking about before, like maybe invest in childcare. And if the government invests in childcare,
*  maybe a parent who puts their kid in childcare opens a business and that business is a success and
*  it generates more tax revenue, which we know from last year we need, that's the virtuous cycle you're
*  talking about. Lots of good things can happen. That would be sort of the platonic ideal of the
*  virtuous cycle there or the Rubinite ideal of the virtuous cycle there you might say. But
*  this is the part where I guess we have to be very honest that neither party, even if they decided
*  one day that Rubinomics was the solution, seem all that inclined to accept the version of economic
*  events that would be required to pull it off. Right. Democrats don't want spending cuts,
*  Republicans don't want tax increases and Congress is split in this moment.
*  Yeah, it's basically impossible for me to imagine. President Biden standing up, giving
*  us to the Union speech and saying, we need trillions of dollars of new taxes on rich people and
*  corporations in order to bring down the deficit. We're not going to spend them on anything
*  else, we're going to bring down the deficit. And Republicans applauding him and sending him a
*  bill to do it. I just don't think that that's possible. They have opposed tax increases as a party
*  for a very long time and I don't think there's any chance they would go for something like that.
*  In the same way, it's hard to imagine Democrats in Congress who to be very clear would like to raise
*  taxes in order to spend that money on more programs like childcare. It's hard to imagine them
*  agreeing to even steeper cuts and spending from Republicans, particularly ones that touch
*  cherished programs like Social Security and Medicare. That's not where they are as a party either.
*  And so you're at this moment where really it is very difficult to imagine either party adopting
*  the other party's view of what vehicle is the right one to take to reduce in the deficit,
*  even if they could agree that reducing the deficit might be a good thing. And so I think probably
*  what you're really looking at is more economic disruption as possibly the only thing that could
*  be a forcing agent by which I mean, if you think a 5% bond is bad, wait till it goes higher.
*  If borrowing costs go from 5 to 6 to 7 to 8, you might see people's positions change a bit,
*  but I don't even know then. I really think that the fiscal problem is so wrapped up in the great
*  political impasse that we are in in this country and the sort of inability of lawmakers to find
*  common ground that it seems very difficult to imagine anything close to a resolution for this
*  anytime soon. Right. What you're really getting at is our political dysfunction begets our fiscal
*  dysfunction and then our political dysfunction ensures that there's no solution for our fiscal
*  dysfunction. Yeah, I think that's exactly right.
*  And that is kind of the really difficult thing about fiscal debates, particularly in Washington
*  today. There are not easy low-hanging fruits to pick that actually make a difference in these
*  deficit issues and the ideas that smart people have on the table are at best Hail Mary's to actual
*  progress. Well, Jim, thank you very much for your
*  appreciate. Thank you, Michael. We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. With an Israeli ground invasion, imminent, Egypt opened
*  its border to allow for humanitarian aid to enter Gaza for the first time since the war began.
*  But with food and fuel cut off to the territory, Palestinian leaders called the initial
*  convoy of 20 trucks entirely insufficient to meet the needs of the two million people inside of Gaza.
*  The precise timing of an invasion remains unclear, but clashes between Israel and its Arab
*  neighbors, Lebanon and Syria intensified over the weekend, raising fears that the conflict could
*  quickly widen beyond Gaza. In an effort to prevent that, the US said it was supplying Israel with new
*  air defense systems that would allow it to repel missile attacks from its neighbors. Meanwhile,
*  President Biden spoke with the two American hostages released by Hamas on Friday,
*  a mother and daughter from Illinois who were visiting aki boots when they were kidnapped.
*  And at least 10 Republicans have announced they will run for Speaker of the House since Friday,
*  when the party voted to reject its latest nominee, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio.
*  As of today, the House has operated without a speaker for the past 19 days, bringing much of
*  the chamber's work to a halt.
