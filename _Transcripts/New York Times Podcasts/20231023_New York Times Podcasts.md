# The Problem With a $2 Trillion Deficit
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6ZNTtM9Y-M)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  On Friday, the U.S. government reported that over the past year, the federal deficit, the
*  gap between what the U.S. spent and what it earned, doubled to nearly $2 trillion.
*  That figure seems to validate the worries of congressional Republicans about government
*  spending, which have been at the center of the messy fight over who should be House Speaker.
*  But as my colleague Jim Tankersley explains, the Republicans' plans won't come close
*  to solving the problem.
*  It's Monday, October 23rd.
*  So Jim, $2 trillion, we now know, is our deficit for just the last year.
*  And I'm not an economist.
*  That seems like a huge number.
*  And I'd like you to put that into perspective.
*  It's a big deficit.
*  It's twice the size of the deficit last year.
*  So a big jump.
*  It's only the third time in American history when we've had a $2 trillion deficit.
*  And the first two were in the depths of the pandemic.
*  We were in a really different economic place than we were those last $2 trillion deficits.
*  We're not just reopening from the pandemic.
*  We're back.
*  And usually, when an economy is growing rapidly, like our economy has been over the last year,
*  deficits go down.
*  But this one did not.
*  Now Jim, deficits are always a tricky subject.
*  Republicans talk about it now all the time.
*  In fact, they have put it at the center of this chaotic speakership fight that they're
*  now having.
*  Yet, you have trained us through many long conversations to understand that deficits
*  aren't necessarily that big of a deal.
*  So how much should we really care about this $2 trillion number?
*  I think we should care a lot.
*  People I know, smart people who I talk to for my stories, who have for a long time said
*  don't worry about deficits, don't worry too much about deficits, are starting to worry
*  more.
*  And it's because of two big changes in circumstances.
*  We update our views based on the information that changes around us.
*  The first big change is that you don't normally run big deficits when the economy is growing.
*  And so that's an alarm bell in itself.
*  Historically, when you get growth, what happens is that the government brings in more taxes
*  because people are earning more money and spending more money and the deficit usually
*  goes down.
*  But not here.
*  But the second reason why a lot of economists worry about the deficit right now, when maybe
*  they weren't even a few months ago, is how much it's costing the country all of a sudden
*  to borrow all this money we need to cover the deficit.
*  The spending costs for the federal government have shot up in the last few months.
*  And if they stay high, that is going to become this sort of feedback loop for deficits.
*  We pay a lot more on interest, and therefore we have to borrow more to pay the interest.
*  And that could become a really bad cycle for the government and the economy.
*  You're describing a kind of financial double whammy that sounds very grim.
*  I want to get to the root causes of these two changed circumstances you're describing.
*  The fact that our deficit doubled despite a healthy economy and the fact that our borrowing
*  costs to make up for that deficit have grown so quickly.
*  So let's start with why our deficit got so big in the past year.
*  The biggest reason is the amount of tax revenue that we brought in last year as a country
*  was just way down.
*  Down by like 9%.
*  Why was that?
*  Well, we cut a bunch of taxes over the last couple of decades.
*  That includes the Trump tax cuts, which passed in 2017.
*  But we knew about those Trump tax cuts.
*  We knew they were going to hold down revenues.
*  And revenues still came in lower than forecasters expected.
*  And that was because of all sorts of weird little reasons.
*  Capital gains taxes, like what happens when you sell a stock, they went way down.
*  Tariffs revenue went down.
*  We just bought less stuff imported from other countries.
*  There were natural disasters all over the country that caused the IRS to change some
*  tax filing deadlines for like people in California.
*  And so they didn't have to pay certain taxes before the end of the fiscal year.
*  All of that added up to this huge drop in tax revenues.
*  So the big thing that happened here is that we took in a heck of a lot less tax money
*  than we did the year before.
*  But as we all know, deficits happen when our spending outstrips our tax revenue.
*  So I'm curious, did we spend a lot more even as this tax revenue fell by, I think what
*  you said, 9%?
*  It's not a secret we're spending a lot of money right now in this country.
*  For example, on the war in Ukraine, we're about to spend even more money on the war
*  in Israel.
*  Is that a factor in this deficit?
*  Actually not a very big one.
*  Spending didn't actually go up very much last year, even with what we spent in Ukraine.
*  I know Republicans like to talk about this a lot, but this type of sort of emergency
*  defense spending aid to foreign countries is mostly short term and it's not very big
*  in the context of the overall budget and certainly not very big in the context of our long haul
*  budget problems.
*  So spending didn't go up by nearly as much as tax revenues fell.
*  The big driver here is taxes.
*  It's that surprisingly big drop in tax revenue.
*  Okay, clearly we have a tax problem.
*  Now Jim walk us through this second big change you alluded to before that compounds this
*  problem, the high cost of borrowing money to fill our deficit gap.
*  Okay, so when the government takes in less money in tax revenue than it needs to spend
*  on government services, it has to borrow the money and there's a way that it borrows the
*  money.
*  It issues bonds, treasury bonds, and when interest rates are low in the economy, which
*  they have been for a really long time since the 2008 financial crisis, the cost of borrowing
*  for the government is not very much.
*  It's able to sort of to go out, get a bunch of money, not have to worry about paying a
*  lot more back.
*  And so the total interest costs that it's paying as part of its budget are low.
*  But now what's happened is the interest rate of a 10-year treasury bond has been hovering
*  right around 5%, which is significantly higher than we've experienced in recent years.
*  If it stays at 5% for a long time, that means significantly higher interest costs for the
*  government, which means it's going to need to borrow more money to pay those costs.
*  So basically it sounds like the government is facing the same financial scenario that
*  everybody else in America is facing right now, which is higher interest rates on their
*  loans, to buy a car, to buy a house.
*  If you want to go buy a house right now, instead of paying 2%, 3%, which you did a decade ago,
*  you're paying 5 or even more percent and it sucks.
*  Right.
*  It's really rough for the government's balance sheet.
*  That's a lot to be paying in interest at a time when you're going to have mounting interest
*  costs and mounting deficits anyway.
*  Okay, so just walk us through what the world looks like for a country with as much deficit
*  as we have and a 5% interest rate cost of borrowing.
*  So last year, by the way, interest rates were not 5% for all of last year.
*  They were lower for a while, then they jumped in recent months.
*  But last year, the federal government spent $659 billion just to pay interest on the national
*  debt, just for interest.
*  Wow.
*  If rates stay at 5%, that number is going to go way up.
*  Right.
*  And that's a tremendous amount of money to have to take out of the economy just to pay
*  interest.
*  I'm thinking of all the good that money could do if we didn't have to spend it on interest
*  on debt.
*  Perhaps it could be used to build a bridge, infrastructure, technology, child care, whatever,
*  something else that would benefit a lot of people.
*  So yeah, this is one of the worries about higher interest costs is that that interest
*  cost starts to what's called crowd out other spending.
*  So maybe we can't build more bridges because we have to pay this interest or maybe we have
*  to reduce Medicaid benefits and health care to people who really need it.
*  The big worry is that if Congress doesn't want to get into this ongoing big spiral of
*  bigger deficits and higher borrowing costs and more and more of the federal budget going
*  to pay interest on the debt, lawmakers are going to have to make some pretty tough choices
*  about taxes and spending.
*  And I don't know if you've been watching Congress lately, but they are not exactly really good
*  right now at making tough choices.
*  Or any choices.
*  Or any choices.
*  But let alone truly tough choices.
*  Right.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Jim, we just agreed that it's a tough time in Washington to confront the financial challenges
*  we're talking about.
*  But I do want to pause to note that Republicans in their own very complicated and to many
*  people dysfunctional way are talking a lot about deficits, spending and debt right now.
*  So I want to talk through that and make sense of how Republicans and in a few moments Democrats
*  are thinking about the scale of the deficit in this moment and these higher borrowing
*  costs.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's start with the Republicans.
*  Republicans have been warning for more than a decade that America's deficits were too
*  high and that we needed to bring them down with the exception of when Republicans were
*  president.
*  And that is an important thing to keep in mind here.
*  They passed a large tax cut under President Trump and deficits went up and they didn't
*  complain in the way they are complaining now.
*  With some exceptions, there are some Republican fiscal hawks who have complained throughout
*  in a bipartisan fashion.
*  Those Republicans who do talk about deficits and have sort of consistently over the years,
*  what they're really talking about is reducing spending levels and the size of government.
*  They don't want to increase revenues.
*  They want to reduce the amount that the government is spending.
*  And what those Republicans who are clamoring about deficits are talking most about is a
*  very particular type of spending, which is non-defense discretionary spending.
*  Just to find that.
*  And includes a bunch of things that are fairly popular, national parks, the Department of
*  Education, and other things keeping the business of the government running day to day.
*  Pretty small in the context of a budget that also includes national security and large
*  social programs like social security and Medicare.
*  And so here's the way that I think about it.
*  If the deficit is sort of a leak in the whole of our national budgetary boat that is growing
*  over time, you could think of non-defense discretionary as the rain falling on the deck.
*  Not where the water is really coming into the boat.
*  There is water coming in.
*  It's not the big driver.
*  You could cut it to zero and still not solve the problem.
*  So you could stop the rain, the hole is still going to be there.
*  And I think if all you're focused on is these cuts that they would like to see in discretionary
*  spending, you're not anywhere close to making a dent in the problem.
*  And the best sort of hope you would have as one of the advocates of that plan is that
*  you've taken a meaningful first step.
*  But it is not a solution and they are not arguing over an actual way to change the course
*  meaningfully of the national debt.
*  That's really helpful context.
*  So what about Democrats and President Biden?
*  How do they talk about these deficits and the borrowing costs and the threat of the
*  two of them interacting in all the ways that everyone now fears?
*  If I'm being honest, I don't feel like Democrats as a party talk all that much about the deficit.
*  Yeah, the Biden administration has been really tough to pin down on this.
*  The president and his advisors won't tell you exactly what they think the ideal deficit
*  number should be.
*  They just say they want it to be fiscally sustainable.
*  They're not trying to balance the budget over time.
*  None of their proposals have done that.
*  But they do think that we need more tax revenue over time to make that sustainability happen.
*  So what they've settled on is proposing deficit reduction with things they think voters will
*  really like.
*  Like what?
*  That's mostly raising taxes on corporations and rich people.
*  In short, Democrats mostly want to reduce deficits by raising taxes at the top.
*  And Republicans entirely want to reduce the deficit by cutting spending.
*  You've already said that the Republican plan isn't really up to the scale of the problem.
*  Is the Democratic plan potentially, the tax plan, up to the scale of the problem?
*  Very few budget experts think that's possible entirely with tax increases on the rich and
*  the amount of tax increases that the president has proposed now is probably nowhere close
*  to enough to actually stabilize the debt and deficits in a world where borrowing costs
*  stay really high.
*  Got it.
*  So what the world really needs is some sort of a Goldilocks solution that takes the Democrats'
*  instincts perhaps to raise taxes and marries it to the Republican instincts to cut spending.
*  And this is where we get into the real hard choices problem.
*  The sort of think tank industry around stabilizing the budget in Washington basically agrees
*  that you need a mix of two things to stabilize deficits.
*  The first is some tax increases, which Republicans refuse to do.
*  And the second is a thing that President Biden has unilaterally ruled out.
*  All Democrats basically rule out and most Republicans also rule out, including former
*  President Trump, which is reducing government spending on Social Security and Medicare.
*  The big entitlement programs, right?
*  Right.
*  And so that's what the fiscal hawks say.
*  Hey, we need to make some changes over time.
*  We can raise some taxes.
*  We can reduce some benefits.
*  And that's the Goldilocks solution.
*  But in this case, it's like everybody hates Goldilocks.
*  And so it's going to be a very difficult.
*  I mean, it's just a very difficult conversation for Washington to even start having about
*  the actual drivers of debt when seemingly tax increases are off the table and so are
*  the big spending programs that are responsible for the big projected growth and spending
*  in the years to come.
*  When was the last time we got even close to this Goldilocks style solution?
*  Yeah.
*  So the last time we had a fiscal trajectory that got itself not just to stabilize deficits,
*  but an actual balanced budget was this magical time.
*  You might remember Michael called the 1990s.
*  Oh, yes.
*  I was running because I thought we ought to change the direction of the country.
*  I was worried about the decline in middle class incomes, the growth of the underclass,
*  an exploding deficit, a declining level of investment.
*  Bill Clinton was president and first he and Democrats raised some taxes.
*  And then when Republicans took over the House of Representatives, Clinton worked with them
*  and agreed on some spending cuts.
*  It seems to me that a lot of our problems are not particularly partisan in nature.
*  Clinton would make a point about this.
*  Having said that, I'd like to now bring the speaker on, let him say a word or two, and
*  then we'll get on with your questions.
*  Mr. Speaker?
*  Early on, he even did a town hall with the Republican speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich,
*  to just talk about how they were going to bring down the deficit together.
*  I believe in this process, working with the president, with the House and the Senate,
*  I believe we can get to a balanced budget in a positive way, but it's got to be done
*  exactly like here today.
*  So I hope with your permission, the president and I will now have a dialogue with you.
*  And then we got a bunch of great economic growth and all of that combined to actually
*  balancing the budget for several years at the end of the 90s.
*  A truly balanced budget.
*  Same money coming in as went out.
*  For the kids out there, it once happened.
*  It once happened.
*  And I think really crucially, the sort of engine behind Clinton's efforts to do that
*  was an actual economic theory that has now become associated with the guy who was his
*  Treasury Secretary, Robert Rubin, Rubinomics.
*  And the idea of Rubinomics was, if you can reduce the deficit and maybe even balance
*  the budget, then you can actually stoke more economic growth.
*  And you do that because lower deficits help to relieve pressure on interest rates.
*  They can help interest rates fall in the economy.
*  And the idea being lower interest rates mean more people borrow money to buy houses or
*  cars or whatever.
*  There's more economic activity.
*  You can get a growth bang for deficit reduction.
*  And that theory totally fell out of favor among Democrats in particular in the last
*  couple of decades.
*  Why?
*  Because economic conditions changed.
*  Interest rates were low and there wasn't going to be much of a bang for deficit reduction
*  in reducing rates that were basically zero across the economy.
*  But now that they're climbing again, now that that 10-year Treasury is back around 5%, you
*  start to hear some whispers from some people around Washington about, could Rubinomics
*  make a comeback?
*  Could Democrats, Republicans work together to reduce the deficit and by bringing down
*  the deficit, sort of stoke more growth?
*  And lower the cost of all that borrowing.
*  And lower the cost of all that borrowing.
*  Exactly.
*  And so I'm not saying we're there yet, but there is speculation that we may be nearing
*  another one of these Rubinite moments where a reduced deficit could help grow the economy
*  and create sort of a virtuous cycle where more growth helps bring down the deficit further
*  in the future.
*  Right.
*  And government money is freed up to do the kinds of things we were talking about before,
*  like maybe invest in childcare.
*  And if the government invests in childcare, maybe a parent who puts their kid in childcare
*  opens a business and that business is a success and it generates more tax revenue, which
*  we know from last year we need.
*  That's the virtuous cycle you're talking about.
*  Lots of good things can happen.
*  That would be sort of the platonic ideal of the virtuous cycle there or the Rubinite ideal
*  of the virtuous cycle there, you might say.
*  But this is the part where I guess we have to be very honest that neither party, even
*  if they decided one day that Rubinomics was the solution, seem all that inclined to accept
*  the version of economic events that would be required to pull it off.
*  Right.
*  Democrats don't want spending cuts.
*  Republicans don't want tax increases.
*  And Congress is split in this moment.
*  Yeah, it's basically impossible for me to imagine President Biden standing up, giving
*  a State of the Union speech and saying, we need trillions of dollars of new taxes on
*  rich people and corporations in order to bring down the deficit.
*  We're not going to spend the money on anything else.
*  We're going to bring down the deficit.
*  And Republicans are plotting him and sending him a bill to do it.
*  I just don't think that that's possible.
*  They have opposed tax increases as a party for a very long time.
*  And I don't think there's any chance they would go for something like that.
*  In the same way, it's hard to imagine Democrats in Congress who, to be very clear, would like
*  to raise taxes in order to spend that money on more programs like childcare.
*  It's hard to imagine them agreeing to even steeper cuts in spending from Republicans
*  particularly ones that touch cherished programs like Social Security and Medicare.
*  That's not where they are as a party either.
*  And so you're at this moment where really it is very difficult to imagine either party
*  adopting the other party's view of what vehicle is the right one to take to reducing the deficit,
*  even if they could agree that reducing the deficit might be a good thing.
*  And so I think probably what you're really looking at is more economic disruption as
*  possibly the only thing that could be a forcing agent.
*  By which I mean, if you think a 5% bond deal is bad, wait till it goes higher.
*  If borrowing costs go from 5 to 6 to 7 to 8, you might see people's positions change a bit.
*  But I don't even know then.
*  I really think that the fiscal problem is so wrapped up in the great political impasse
*  that we are in in this country and the sort of inability of lawmakers to find common ground
*  that it seems very difficult to imagine anything close to a resolution for this anytime soon.
*  Right. What you're really getting at is our political dysfunction begets our fiscal dysfunction.
*  And then our political dysfunction ensures that there's no solution for our fiscal dysfunction.
*  Yeah, I think that's exactly right.
*  And that is kind of the really difficult thing about fiscal debates, particularly in Washington today.
*  There are not easy, low-hanging fruits to pick that actually make a difference in these deficit issues.
*  And the ideas that smart people have on the table are at best, hail Mary's, to actual progress.
*  Well, Jim, thank you very much. We appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  With an Israeli ground invasion imminent, Egypt opened its border to allow for humanitarian aid
*  to enter Gaza for the first time since the war began. But with food and fuel cut off to the
*  territory, Palestinian leaders called the initial convoy of 20 trucks entirely insufficient
*  to meet the needs of the two million people inside of Gaza.
*  The precise timing of an invasion remains unclear, but clashes between Israel and its Arab neighbors,
*  Lebanon and Syria, intensified over the weekend, raising fears that the conflict could quickly
*  widen beyond Gaza. In an effort to prevent that, the U.S. said it was supplying Israel with new
*  air defense systems that would allow it to repel missile attacks from its neighbors.
*  Meanwhile, President Biden spoke with the two American hostages released by Hamas on Friday,
*  a mother and daughter from Illinois who were visiting Aqibuts when they were kidnapped.
*  And at least 10 Republicans have announced they will run for Speaker of the House
*  since Friday, when the party voted to reject its latest nominee,
*  Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio. As of today, the House has operated without a speaker for the past
*  19 days, bringing much of the Chamber's work to a halt.
