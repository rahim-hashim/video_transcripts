# Can an ‘Anarcho-Capitalist’ President Save Argentina’s Economy?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u2iL2MwIWk)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Argentina, a poster child for economic dysfunction, is again in the midst of an acute crisis.
*  Last month, fed up with liberal fixes, Argentines voted for the candidate promising to blow
*  it all up.
*  Today, my colleague Jack Nickus on Javier Millet, the right-wing populist now taking
*  office in Argentina, and his radical plan to remake the country's economy.
*  It's Monday, December 11th.
*  Jack, it's nice to see you again.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  So we are talking today about Argentina and its new president, Javier Millet.
*  He was inaugurated yesterday, and he's a pretty flamboyant and colorful populist, kind of
*  styled in the vein of Donald Trump.
*  So tell me about this new president.
*  Well, this was really one of the most surprising elections in Argentina's history.
*  And from the start, the national conversation was dominated by Javier Millet.
*  I'm Javier Millet.
*  I'm an economist, liberal, libertarian.
*  He spent years working as an economist and teaching economics, then was elected as a
*  freshman congressman, who really didn't show up to Congress much, but really became known
*  to Argentines for many years of TV punditry.
*  You are the parasites.
*  You are the ones who oppress us.
*  You are the worst.
*  He used to be brought onto these cable news talk shows to be the token conservative voice
*  in a country that has in recent years been pretty left leaning.
*  And he really stood out for a combative style and opinions that are really outside of the
*  mainstream.
*  The Pope is the representative of the evil in the earth.
*  So for example, he called the Pope a communist and the embodiment of evil.
*  The Pope impels communism.
*  And bear in mind, the Pope is Argentine and a huge figure in the country.
*  So this was really controversial.
*  Let's start with the truth.
*  And he's also suggested that the left has greatly exaggerated the number of disappearances
*  or murders that occurred during the bloody military dictatorship in the 1970s and 1980s.
*  And that struck a lot of people as a troubling sympathy for the country's authoritarian past.
*  He's argued that the right is aesthetically and intellectually superior than the left.
*  He has said climate change is a socialist plot.
*  And in the lead up to his elections, he was peddling baseless claims of voter fraud.
*  But despite these unusual and to many worrisome politics, the thing that you need to understand
*  about Argentina is that politics is really about economics.
*  And Millet is the candidate promising a sharp break economically.
*  Cutting public works, because everything they do with public works is a shameless robbery,
*  it's a monument to corruption.
*  Specifically, he's pitching voters on a libertarian overhaul of government.
*  And libertarian meaning?
*  Meaning that he wants to essentially kind of get the state to get out of the way.
*  Ministry of Education, indoctrination, outside!
*  Ministry of Public Works, outside!
*  Even if you resist.
*  He's trying to argue that the state is predatory against the average citizen in its policies
*  and taxes, etc.
*  And these libertarian views would really be a radical departure from what the government
*  and what Argentina has had for decades, essentially.
*  I want to tell all Argentinians that today begins the end of the decadent Argentina.
*  And so Millet's election victory showed how desperate voters are for change.
*  So tell me about that desperation.
*  Like what was it that caused Argentines to elect this political newcomer with these extreme
*  views?
*  Well, I think anyone who has been vaguely paying attention to Argentina over the past several
*  decades knows that they've been dealing with an economic crisis after economic crisis for
*  a long time and they are currently in one of their worst.
*  And that's saying something for Argentina.
*  Right now, annual inflation stands at above 140%.
*  The Argentine peso has completely disintegrated in value and just more and more Argentines
*  are falling into poverty.
*  So what does 140% inflation look like?
*  Give us a sense of that.
*  Well, it's a situation where the value of the Argentine currency is constantly falling
*  and prices are constantly going up.
*  So it's a bit confusing to live in Argentina sometimes.
*  I'll give you one example.
*  When I was in Buenos Aires recently, I met this owner of a hardware store called Oscar
*  Benitez.
*  His store is this really lovely little kind of almost tiny walk-in closet in a way, but
*  covered in products, screws and hinges and locks, but he doesn't know the price really
*  of any of them.
*  It takes a while to put all these prices back together.
*  No, no, I don't put them all together.
*  I have 80,000 items.
*  Because of the fact that the peso's value is falling so quickly and prices are rising
*  so quickly and when someone wants to buy something, he has to go to his computer to look at a
*  list that the supplier provides him, which is constantly updating with new prices.
*  So how often does he have to do this?
*  With what frequency do you have to change the prices?
*  With what frequency do you have to change the prices?
*  Because even in the past two weeks.
*  He said that those prices were changing it sometimes several times a week.
*  Wow.
*  And how is he doing personally with his financial?
*  He was depressed and kind of had a lot of gals' humor about the situation.
*  I mean, he at one point called the Argentine peso, used toilet paper.
*  And as a result, he has tried to find ways to cope.
*  What does he do when he gets money?
*  He buys for.
*  He doesn't want to hold on to it?
*  No, because the peso doesn't have any value.
*  When he gets pesos, he tries to get rid of them as quickly as possible so they don't
*  lose any more value.
*  So he either goes and buys more products and supplies.
*  He has way more than he really needs, but he feels they hold value better than the peso
*  or he buys U.S. dollars.
*  So he's basically trying to preserve the value of the money that he has by going out and
*  buying dollars.
*  Exactly.
*  And Argentines for many years now have flocked to dollar bills to hold their value, to save
*  their money.
*  As a result, more than $200 billion in hard U.S. currency is now in Argentina.
*  And that means that on a per capita basis, Argentines hold more bank notes, U.S. bank
*  notes than Americans.
*  Wow.
*  In fact, anybody who has bought a house in Argentina will tell you that they almost certainly
*  bought it in $100 bills.
*  Okay, so Argentines have a lot of American dollars, which is of course a bad sign for
*  their economy.
*  Reminds me a lot of Russia in the 1990s when also the ruble was just going wild and losing
*  value.
*  used dollars to buy big important things.
*  At that time, it was a communist economy going into the global one.
*  What is it here?
*  What caused this in Argentina?
*  Well, it's a long story, but the short story is that it's really just decades of deep economic
*  mismanagement.
*  A series of left-leaning governments has expanded the social safety net with things like free
*  Free health care, free universities, a dramatic expansion of social programs, deep subsidies
*  for energy and public transportation, big pensions, and all of that without much economic
*  revenue to pay for it.
*  But to make up for that shortfall, they have drained economic reserves, they have taken
*  out massive international debt, and also just printed more money.
*  And that has left the peso much less valuable and prices skyrocketing.
*  Which brings us to Mr. Malay.
*  So what are the specifics of what he's proposing, Jack?
*  I mean, what's his economic plan exactly?
*  Well, he wants to take Argentina in a completely different direction.
*  So specifically, he wants to drastically shrink the size of government.
*  He wants to eliminate 10 of the government's 18 ministries.
*  He has proposed privatizing the state airline, the railroad company, the state oil company,
*  and really trying to remake the Argentine government and Argentina itself in his libertarian
*  view of the world.
*  And that also means some much more radical ideas.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Okay so Malay is elected.
*  He has this kind of Hail Mary plan to rescue the country's economy, including slashing
*  and really taking a chainsaw as he has on spending.
*  But there's something you said that's even more radical at the heart of his plan.
*  What is it?
*  So actually, the central part of his campaign pitch has been what we would call dollarization.
*  He essentially wants to use the US dollar as Argentina's national currency.
*  Use the US dollar as Argentina's national currency.
*  How would that work?
*  So basically his argument is that the Argentine government has shown to be so irresponsible
*  in its management of the currency and the Argentine peso has become so worthless, you
*  might as well just kill it and use a more stable currency, specifically like the dollar.
*  And he chose the dollar because Argentina is already kind of dollarized.
*  We spoke about how people buy houses with US dollars.
*  They stash US dollars under their floorboards and their mattresses.
*  So this is a country that is already deeply comfortable with the US dollar and is already
*  using a lot of US dollars.
*  And so he basically wants to formalize that.
*  And is this a thing?
*  I mean, have countries done this before?
*  It is.
*  There are more than 30 countries that have actually adopted another nation's currency
*  as their own legal tender.
*  And in Latin America, specifically, there have been a few cases of dollarization.
*  Panama is dollarized.
*  Ecuador.
*  So this is not a completely novel idea, but Argentina is a larger and more sophisticated
*  economy than those other nations.
*  Okay, so dollarization has been done, though in smaller Latin American countries.
*  But what are the mechanics of it?
*  How does it work?
*  So how to do it is relatively simple.
*  In theory.
*  First, the country must agree upon an exchange rate for its currency to the dollar.
*  And then the country on a specified date essentially flips the switch.
*  And all of its obligations, things like contracts and deposits and loans and wages, are all
*  converted to dollars on paper at that agreed upon rate.
*  And then there is another part, which is potentially more tricky, particularly for Argentina.
*  And that is converting all of Argentine's pesos, the physical bank notes, to physical
*  US dollars.
*  And for that, you need dollars.
*  So mainstream economists believe that the government may need up to 30 to 40 billions
*  to dollarize.
*  And that could be a big problem for Millet and his plans.
*  If you consider their debts, they basically have zero.
*  So Argentines, like Oscar, the hardware store owner, they might have a lot of dollars.
*  But what you're saying is that the government itself does not.
*  Exactly.
*  One risk is that if the government doesn't have enough dollars, it may not give Argentines
*  much confidence in a dollarization scheme.
*  So for instance, if you're an Argentine and you see in your bank account that the government
*  has now suddenly converted your pesos to dollars, but you're skeptical that the government actually
*  has enough dollars for everyone, maybe you're going to go to the bank and take that money
*  out before your neighbor does.
*  And if the next person does that, and then the next person does that, now we have a run
*  on the banks.
*  So a lot of hurdles here.
*  They need dollars to dollarize.
*  They don't have them.
*  And then there's a chance that when people see what's happening, they panic, they raise
*  to the banks, and they take their money out, causing a real crisis in the financial system.
*  Exactly.
*  So there are some real hurdles and some real risks.
*  But there is also a competing view that there could be real benefits.
*  We have seen dollarization really almost eliminate inflation in the past.
*  On top of that, in a place like Argentina, where there is $200 billion in US currencies
*  stuffed under mattresses and in safe deposit boxes, dollarization could bring those dollars
*  from under mattresses and into banks officially.
*  And that could be a real benefit for the economy.
*  So there's a real question about whether his signature policy, this dollarization, would
*  actually work, even if he could pull it off.
*  But I guess the question in my mind, since he's now, of course, in office as of today,
*  is can he pull it off?
*  He has these ideas that were electric for people in Argentina, for voters, but can he
*  implement them?
*  Well, I think that's another major hurdle to his plan for dollarization.
*  Because remember, Millet is a total political outsider.
*  He's coming in with no governing experience.
*  His nascent political party, just two years old, has just 15% of the seats in the House.
*  And something like dollarization would need congressional approval.
*  So what we've seen since the election is actually a bit of dealmaking.
*  He has actually started to make deals with a center-right coalition, which would give
*  him potential control of Congress.
*  But as a result, he has brought in more moderate members into his cabinet.
*  And his focus in recent weeks has really shifted from things like dollarization to more about
*  his plans to shrink the size of government and budget cuts.
*  And I think what we're seeing is Millet is confronting the political and economic reality
*  as president of Argentina.
*  And dollarization may be something he does down the road.
*  So this is a case where Millet campaigns as an outsider with these radical plans, but
*  the political realities force him to moderate those plans once he's in office.
*  Well, I think we should remember that what Millet is proposing for right now for Argentina
*  is actually rather radical, particularly when considering Argentina's history.
*  These would be very, very deep government budget cuts.
*  And this is a country where many people have come to rely upon government services and
*  subsidies.
*  And so these policies could be really difficult.
*  And remember, this is a country that is already struggling with a deep economic crisis.
*  So poverty is already up, hunger is already up, and that could get worse.
*  And Millet has actually warned the next year is going to be very tough.
*  But on the other side, this is actually what some economists think Argentina should have
*  been doing a long time ago.
*  They actually need some of this hard medicine, but we don't know how it's going to play out
*  in reality.
*  So in other words, the Hail Mary that Argentines went for in this election, it may in fact
*  be the medicine that the ailing economy needs.
*  But the application of that medicine, it's going to be very difficult to swallow.
*  Have Argentines considered that the cure could feel as bad as the disease?
*  I think that's a major risk.
*  Millet is a radically libertarian president who has an avowed hatred for the government,
*  who is now in charge of what has for many years been a very big government.
*  And he's made clear that starting this week, his plans to shrink that government will be
*  really painful for the country.
*  And so that means that a populace that's already suffering so much economically is now being
*  told that they're going to have to suffer a lot more before it gets any better.
*  So the question is, will Argentines put up with that?
*  Whether or not they do may decide after so many years of struggle, whether Argentina
*  can finally write its course.
*  Jack, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Senoras, Ministro de la Corte.
*  On Sunday, after being sworn into office, President Millet addressed thousands of his
*  supporters in the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires.
*  We don't seek or wish for the harsh decisions that will have to be taken in the coming weeks,
*  but unfortunately we haven't been given the option.
*  In the speech, Millet laid the responsibility for the country's economic problems at the
*  feet of the outgoing administration and promised to take the, quote, necessary decisions to
*  solve them.
*  Soon after, in his first official decree, the new president cut the number of government
*  ministries from 18 to 9.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else to know today.
*  Over the weekend, prominent Democrats moved to denounce anti-Semitism in the wake of a
*  growing scandal that saw the president of the University of Pennsylvania resign after
*  giving testimony to Congress last week.
*  We shouldn't have to gather on a rainy day in Pennsylvania to talk about anti-Semitism.
*  But we must.
*  Appearing at a synagogue in Philadelphia, Senator Bob Casey and Governor Josh Shapiro
*  made the show of solidarity just one day after the resignation of the university president,
*  Elizabeth McGill.
*  McGill's departure followed days of pressure from donors, political leaders, and alumni
*  who had criticized remarks she made to Congress that appeared to evade the question of whether
*  students who called for the genocide of Jews should be punished.
*  The presidents of Harvard and MIT made similar remarks to Congress last week and are now
*  also under pressure to resign.
*  European Union policymakers agreed late last week to a sweeping new law to regulate artificial
*  intelligence, one of the world's first comprehensive attempts to limit the use of a rapidly evolving
*  technology.
*  The law, called the AI Act, sets a benchmark for countries seeking to harness the potential
*  benefits of the technology while trying to protect against the possible risks, like automating
*  jobs, spreading misinformation online, and endangering national security.
