*  Hi, I'm Robert Kolker and I'm a contributing writer to the New York Times magazine.
*  This is a story about a family.
*  There doesn't seem to be anything extraordinary about this particular family at all, except
*  maybe that there are a lot of siblings.
*  Nine, to be exact.
*  They're just middle-class Americans who mine their own business.
*  A very ordinary family that wants nothing more than to just stay ordinary.
*  And yet, each of them have something inside their genetic code that could severely curtail
*  their quality of life and completely change the lives of everyone around them.
*  This week's Sunday Reade is a story I wrote for the magazine about a family who learned
*  that they'd inherited a genetic mutation, one that causes a rare form of dementia.
*  It's something called FTD or Frontotemporal dementia.
*  Even like Alzheimer's disease, FTD usually strikes in the prime of one's adult life.
*  You could be as young as, say, 40.
*  And it goes after the part of the brain responsible for planning, understanding social cues, and
*  making judgments.
*  In the beginning, you start to act impulsively.
*  You have weird conversations with strangers.
*  Then your capacity for language starts to weaken.
*  You might have a master's degree and be an expert in something, but suddenly you're
*  talking like a fifth grader.
*  And then, as the years go on, your abilities get even more limited.
*  Until finally, you can't even take care of yourself.
*  Diagnosing this rare condition is extremely difficult, and there's currently no cure.
*  And so it was horrifying and catastrophic for this family to learn that each of them
*  has a 50% chance, a coin flip of having the genetic mutation for FTD.
*  But then what happened next was even more surprising, which was that some of them decided
*  not to get tested.
*  They didn't want to know just yet.
*  For some of them, the only thing to do was to continue living their lives, because you
*  can't do anything about it anyway.
*  Still, that anxiety completely took up their days.
*  It's like walking around saying don't think of elephants.
*  Suddenly you're thinking about elephants.
*  And so it becomes this moral conundrum.
*  Do you need to tell your partner if you carry this genetic mutation?
*  Do you have children?
*  And if you do, do you let them know that they might be afflicted with a debilitating
*  disease much later in life?
*  Then would you even tell them?
*  When I started writing about this family, I wondered how much of this family's affliction
*  would actually translate outside of their particular experience.
*  But what I found was that their dilemma was quite relatable.
*  We all wonder what the future holds.
*  Whether it's high cholesterol or a relative having cancer, we all wonder about what we
*  would or wouldn't want to know about our genetic destinies.
*  About a year ago, I heard from the youngest of these nine siblings, a woman in her 40's
*  named Barb.
*  I met with her personally and we spoke at length.
*  The story Barb told me begins 30 years earlier when one of her sisters started to experience
*  strange symptoms.
*  This is her family's story.
*  The Vanishing Family, read by Eduardo Ballerini.
*  Barb was the youngest in her large Irish Catholic family, a surprise baby, the ninth child,
*  born 10 years after the eighth.
*  Living in the suburbs of Pittsburgh, her family followed the football schedule.
*  High school games on Friday night, college games on Saturday, the Steelers on Sunday.
*  It was an engineer, mom was a homemaker, and Barb was the family mascot, blonde and
*  adorable, watching her brothers and sisters finish school and go on to their careers.
*  Barb was the only child left at home in the 1980s to witness the seams of her parents'
*  marriage come apart.
*  Her father, Obat left, and her mother turned inward, sitting quietly in front of the television,
*  always smoking, often with a cocktail.
*  Being at overtaken her, though it wasn't clear what.
*  Barb observed it all with a measure of detachment.
*  Her parents had been older than most, and her sisters and brothers supplied more than
*  enough parental energy to make up the difference.
*  And so in 1990, when Barb was 14 and her mother learned she had breast cancer and died
*  within months at the age of 62, Barb was shattered and bewildered, but also protected.
*  Her siblings had already stepped in, three of them living back home.
*  Together they arrived at a shared understanding of the tragedy.
*  Their mother could have lived longer if she had cut back on her drinking sooner, or gone
*  to see a doctor, or hadn't smoked.
*  Six years later, Barb was 20 and in college when someone else in the family needed help.
*  Her sister, Kristi, was the second born, 24 years older than Barb, and the star of the
*  family in many ways.
*  She traveled extensively as a pharmaceutical company executive while raising two children
*  with her husband in a nice house in a New Jersey suburb.
*  But where once Kristi was capable and professionally ambitious and socially conscious, now at 44, she
*  was alone.
*  Her clothes unkempt and ripped, her hair unwashed, her marriage over.
*  Again the family came together.
*  Susan, the third born, volunteered to take care of Kristi full time, and Jenny, the eighth,
*  worked for a specialist.
*  The family members asked to be identified by their first names to protect their privacy.
*  Depression was the first suspected diagnosis.
*  Then schizophrenia, though neither seemed quite right.
*  Kristi wasn't sad or delusional, she wasn't even upset.
*  It was more as if she were reverting to a childlike state, losing her neck for self-regulation.
*  Her personality was diluting.
*  On its way out was seemingly nothing to replace it.
*  What was left of Kristi was chaotic and unpredictable.
*  She refused to bathe and stopped bothering to make meals.
*  She crashed a neighbor's party and made out conversation with strangers.
*  She clogged a toilet with tampons and flooded the house.
*  She was gleefully impulsive, spending thousands of dollars a year on magazine subscriptions.
*  That strange reckless profligacy made Barb think of their mother, who in her final years
*  sat at home, saying yes to every sales phone call.
*  A heartbreaking, but also interesting, Barb thought that Kristi shared the same peculiar
*  tendencies, a family trait of sorts.
*  By 2006, Barb was long out of college in her early thirties and married with two children,
*  building a real estate career in Denver.
*  One night when she was putting the kids to bed, her phone rang.
*  It was Mary, the fifth-born, seventeen years older than Barb, in town unannounced.
*  Can you come pick me up, she said.
*  Mary had always been one of Barb's favorite siblings.
*  As a child, she was a piano prodigy, for coaches and outgoing.
*  Her gaze fixed on a future beyond her hometown.
*  Mary grew up to be a mass transportation engineer, consulting on projects from New Orleans
*  to Abu Dhabi.
*  She and her fiance lived in Chicago, where Barb, then in her twenties, would visit,
*  joining them for parties and nights out.
*  But in recent years, things had changed for Mary.
*  She was divorced and remarried with the young son, living in Omaha, and only in occasional
*  contact with the family.
*  And here she was, where Barb lived, with no explanation.
*  That weekend, Barb saw it all, the same movie playing again.
*  Mary's affect was flat, far from the irrepressible sister she once was.
*  Everyday curses seemed beyond her.
*  She was in town for a work trip, she said, but hadn't bothered to book a place to stay
*  or let Barb know in advance.
*  When she talked about the project she was about to manage, it was with the language of
*  a middle or high schooler, not someone with a master's degree in years of expertise.
*  As soon as Mary left, Barb called Mary's husband, who was at his wit's end.
*  Mary had never really bonded with their son, he said.
*  She seemed disengaged from everything around her.
*  The old Mary was disappearing, with nothing to replace her.
*  This went everything cascaded for Barb.
*  What the affliction was, exactly, she didn't know.
*  No one did.
*  But two of her sisters had the same thing that must have so drastically altered their mother.
*  This is genetic, she thought.
*  This is inherited.
*  And then finally, we all might have it.
*  The others ignored Barb's concerns.
*  It wasn't just that she was the youngest in the family and more easily dismissed.
*  It was that a few years earlier, Christie had participated in some genetic tests with
*  the University of California, San Francisco, but had gone nowhere.
*  Based on all the available knowledge about inherited brain disease, the specialist could
*  not find an explanation for her changing behavior.
*  But now Barb fixated on exactly what they were told.
*  How the field was in its infancy, and how just because they couldn't find a genetic marker
*  didn't mean one wasn't there.
*  Barb decided to start a search of her own.
*  We contacted the National Institutes of Health and learned about a condition that bore a striking
*  resemblance to Christie's and Mary's symptoms.
*  Frontotemporal dementia, or FTD, which emerges in the prime of adult life, as young as 40,
*  in some cases, and relentlessly attacks the part of the brain responsible for planning,
*  organizing, expressing language, understanding social cues, and exercising judgment.
*  Unlike more common brain disorders like Alzheimer's, FTD is confoundingly rare.
*  Fisher suggests that perhaps 60,000 Americans have it, though that estimate is complicated
*  by how difficult it is to diagnose.
*  By the mid-Auts, researchers were still starting to identify and sort out the many varieties
*  of FTD, which were hereditary, which weren't.
*  How many were yet to be found?
*  Bruce Willis's family said they finally arrived at a diagnosis of FTD recently after an earlier
*  provisional explanation of aphasia, a condition that impacts speech, but have not disclosed
*  whether his FTD is inherited.
*  The idea that the FTD field was still developing, and the knowledge-based growing, only made Barb
*  more determined.
*  In December 2006, she asked everyone in the family, including their father, to provide
*  blood samples for a new round of analysis.
*  Christie, Jenny, and Susan agreed.
*  The researchers failed to find any known FTD mutations, not surprising in retrospect, given
*  the limited number of samples.
*  Her family's contact at the NIH encouraged her to continue testing through the Mayo clinic.
*  The family remained in the dark, even as they watched Mary follow Christie's trajectory,
*  losing all social awareness, defying common sense.
*  Then the following year, a new piece of information arrived from out of the blue.
*  When Teddy, the seventh sibling, 11 years older than Barb, forwarded an email from a woman
*  trying to track down distant relatives who might share the same medical problem her family
*  seemed to be suffering from.
*  The message included a photograph of the siblings' grandfather, a shared genetic ancestor
*  on their mother's side of the family.
*  We had no idea that branch of the family existed, Barb said.
*  I mean, it was crazy.
*  The medical problem the woman explained later on the phone was FTD.
*  With equal parts awe and dread, Barb contacted the Mayo clinic, which tested both families,
*  two strains of the same gene pool.
*  Several of Barb's siblings participated this time, gathering there in person, as well
*  as some adult grandchildren.
*  With so many samples spanning several generations in different wings of the family, the researchers
*  had a better trail to follow.
*  Sure enough, the families had a mutation of the Tao protein, which is now understood to
*  be one of three major brain proteins associated with inherited FTD.
*  When they came in with the news, you could tell they were elated, Barb said.
*  I think that's how uncommon it is to find.
*  Of course, it was also a catastrophe.
*  There is no bright side to any FTD diagnosis, no cure, no path forward.
*  With very few exceptions, everyone who inherits the mutation will, like Christine Mary, long
*  before their old age, develop inappropriate social behavior and lose the ability to earn
*  an income, look after their children, do household chores, or take care of their hygiene.
*  They will eventually be unable to speak, feed or dress themselves, or use the bathroom
*  on their own.
*  This is the case with Christie, who at 71 spends most days in front of the TV and has
*  an Apple air tag clipped to a sneaker in case she wanders off.
*  The decline may be swift, but the end may not be.
*  Unlike Alzheimer's patients who large- their diagnosed when they're elderly, people with
*  FTD can potentially live many years after becoming symptomatic, requiring decades of care,
*  and their children, all their descendants, might carry the mutation too.
*  Every sibling except Susan had children of their own.
*  Kathy, the eldest, had a grandchild.
*  They had all inherited, in essence, a coin flip, a 50% chance that they carry the mutation.
*  Those who don't carry it are in the clear, and so are their descendants.
*  Those who do will develop FTD, and they pass along that same 50% risk to each of their
*  children.
*  I had a four-year-old and a two-year-old at that time, Barb sold me, and I remember
*  thinking I shouldn't have had my kids.
*  She stopped short as she recalled this, then collected herself, which is like a very
*  hard thing for a parent to think.
*  It's a devastating feeling that I may have passed something to them that could hurt them.
*  Even now many in the family struggle with how to explain the impossible situation they
*  found themselves in.
*  An earthquake or hurricane or war comes close.
*  Only a strange science fiction version.
*  Something not visible or experienced by anyone but them.
*  A disaster existing only inside their family's genetic code.
*  There were the facts, it's inherited, anyone might have it, and there were the deeper questions
*  raised by those facts.
*  How do you feel safe knowing that it is in your family's essential nature to be fragile,
*  ephemeral, ever close to exploration?
*  How do you keep living when you know that everything that makes you a conscious person
*  could disappear?
*  If you were going to lose yourself in a year or two or ten, would you even want to know?
*  Once the researchers found the mutation, they encouraged each family member to test at
*  an independent lab to learn who carried it.
*  Everyone in the family could discover which side of the coin flip they landed, but not
*  everyone did.
*  Betty said he was never going back to the Mayo Clinic again, and he hasn't.
*  Even Barb would have been cajoling the others to get tested could not bring herself to do
*  so.
*  Her future seemed like a forked road with no good options.
*  Turn one way you become essentially a shadow version of yourself, and everyone you love
*  has to spend their lives taking care of you.
*  Turn the other, and you still have to say goodbye slowly to some of the people you love
*  the most.
*  I not do whatever you could not to engage in that strange binary choice.
*  And so Barb decided not to decide.
*  She was 32 when the family learned about the mutation in 2008.
*  Even if she did have FTD, she most likely would not present symptoms for at least a decade.
*  She would give herself until her early 40s to take action.
*  I figured, okay, I've got maybe ten good years left, she said.
*  Others in the family would take priority for now.
*  The siblings I was closest with, they all raised me practically, so my immediate concern
*  was for them.
*  Just, you know, how many more people am I going to lose from this disease in the next few
*  years?
*  As long as Barb didn't know if she had it, she would try to live as if she didn't.
*  This was especially important to her because she spent her childhood watching her mother
*  decline and then die.
*  I know that I did not grow up with a normal childhood, Barb said.
*  I wanted to give my kids as normal a childhood as possible.
*  If I knew I was destined to get this horrible disease, how normal would it have been?
*  Of course, not being tested wasn't the same as not having the disease.
*  How could it be?
*  Barb entered a limbo, uncertainty hovering over her.
*  Waking life became a continuous test of cognition, one chance after another to wonder if
*  she was losing it.
*  Literally, everything in a given day that goes wrong.
*  If you forget someone's name or you lose your keys or you do something embarrassing, your
*  mind instantly goes to, this is it, this is the beginning, it's starting, it just totally
*  messes with you, it's exhausting.
*  She was vigilant in policing those thoughts, trying to keep the worst ones at bay even shielding
*  her husband.
*  He told me in a highly convincing way that no matter what happens to me, he's going to
*  be with me until the end, she said.
*  But you know, there were a lot of times where I was dealing with that emotional stress alone,
*  because I didn't want to burden him with it.
*  Her husband meanwhile took action of his own, changing careers, training to be a lawyer
*  to ensure he would make enough to support them.
*  Only years later would they talk explicitly about what he had done.
*  It was a huge sacrifice that he made, Barb said.
*  As time went on and the pretence of normalcy became harder to maintain, Barb still tried
*  to keep her children from hearing about FDD, even though they, like her, might possibly
*  have the mutation, and even though it would be impossible to keep that information from
*  them as they grew older.
*  She also followed new research on FDD and Alzheimer's, two distinct diseases each incurable
*  that attack brain function but with remarkably different genetic properties, and fell into
*  despair as no treatments for FDD emerged from that research.
*  Then as Barb watched Christie and Mary decline further and two more sisters learned they
*  had the mutation, Jenny in 2010, Peggy in 2015, the sense that something was coming for her
*  became impossible to ignore.
*  In 2016, with her 40th birthday closing in, Barb became certain that she did, in fact,
*  have it.
*  She began bracing for the worst, living as if her days were numbered.
*  Eight years after the Mayo Clinic issued its diagnosis, Barb was tested, going in for
*  the blood draw that would tell the story of the rest of her life.
*  The clinicians required patients to receive the news good or bad in person.
*  And Barb never went back to hear the results.
*  Like Barb, Christie's daughter didn't want to find out right away.
*  She knew there was a 50% chance of having it.
*  Her mother had long succumbed to the disease, transforming right before her eyes.
*  She was 12 when her mother's condition became impossible to ignore, when Christie stopped
*  bathing or shopping or making meals.
*  At the time, Christie's daughter, who asked to be identified by her first initial, C,
*  was frightened, not least because of how alone she was.
*  Her father was divorcing her mother and had moved to a neighboring town, and her brother
*  was not yet eight, too young to register some of the things that she understood to be
*  obviously wrong.
*  And now she finds it hard to talk about that time in her life.
*  Driving home once with her, she got a flat tire, and she just kept driving.
*  She told me, I was like, Mom, you know you've got to pull over.
*  It was up to her to raise the alarm with her father.
*  I remember a pipe burst in our house, and she didn't get it repaired.
*  We didn't have water for days.
*  I was just like, Dad, we can't live like this.
*  The children moved in with him when she was thirteen, and Susan moved in with Christie.
*  C's father has helped financially support Christie's care ever since.
*  Today, C is protective of her father.
*  He tried to get her help, she said.
*  He had reached out to my grandfather, my mom's dad, and said, something's wrong with
*  Christie, something's changing.
*  And he just brushed it off.
*  She is equally protective of her own privacy.
*  She mentioned, and several others in the family told me this, that two of her aunts lost
*  their jobs after speaking openly about their family's illness.
*  She is also charitable toward Christie.
*  I do remember her being a wonderful person, just fun and active, she said.
*  But those happier memories seem less accessible to see now, overshadowed by everything that
*  occurred after the disease took over.
*  During her teenage years, she watched from a distance as her aunts Susan handled a host
*  of challenges.
*  She owed the IRS $10,000 in back taxes.
*  Christie ballooned to 250 pounds, until Susan finally padlocked the refrigerator.
*  Once Christie bolted from the mall on a shopping trip and wandered five miles in the cold and
*  rain to a Wendy's, where the police were called and bought her dinner.
*  Susan was in tears when she caught up with her.
*  But Christie was fine, unfazed, even cheerful.
*  During C's visits she could see for herself her mother's mysterious, almost random new
*  personality.
*  Once in front of C's boyfriend, Christie asked C whether she was sleeping with David Hasselhoff,
*  the star of Baywatch, Christie's favorite show at the time.
*  Watching her mother become so unrecognizable was excruciating.
*  But with Susan looking after Christie, C was at least free to be a teenager, to go to
*  school, to one day start a life of her own.
*  Once she was in her mid-twenties, building a career, that might have been that.
*  Her mother's tragic disease, a difficult childhood, a safe landing with her father.
*  Then her family learned about F.T.D.
*  While others, particularly her older relatives, lined up for genetic tests, she, like Barb,
*  froze in place, deciding that she didn't want to know.
*  She wanted to give herself time.
*  I was just like, if I find out I have this right now, I'm not going to have any motivation,
*  she said, I'm not going to have any desire to move forward.
*  She made a bargain with herself.
*  She would be tested in five years, when she turned thirty.
*  For her the decision to delay knowing felt less like denial than a play for personal
*  agency, for control over something she had no control over.
*  For those five years, C worked hard not to think about the family's condition, to move
*  forward as if it wasn't there.
*  Pretending was even less possible for her than for Barb when the example of her own mother
*  was always present directly in front of her, living with full-time care, losing her ability
*  to speak, losing herself.
*  When C turned thirty she had a boyfriend, a serious one, when she told about the risk of
*  F.T.D. almost as soon as they started dating several years earlier.
*  Now they were engaged.
*  She went through with her plan to find out the truth.
*  I wanted him to have the choice to opt out if he didn't want to deal with me, she said.
*  They were together when she learned the news.
*  Her boyfriend held her hand.
*  No words passing between them.
*  I remember even the genetic therapist saying, you guys are just like such a great couple.
*  I'm so sorry I have to tell you this.
*  C approaches her life with a brass tax practicality.
*  Others have it worse than me, as a frequent conversational landing place for her, as is,
*  it is what it is.
*  After a childhood of instability and an adulthood of deep, pervasive uncertainty, she is determined
*  not to waste energy on what she can't change or pull her focus away from a life she loves.
*  She sees the world in this way, it seems, even if that means shaping complex situations
*  in simpler terms.
*  A sort of emotional firewall around the F.T.D. diagnosis.
*  Her husband has become a good partner in maintaining that firewall.
*  They were married, as they had planned.
*  He had already seen my family, she said, smiling.
*  So I guess he kind of knew what he was getting into.
*  Together they sorted through everything they could control.
*  We talked about long-term care insurance and genetic testing for kids, she said.
*  But I think we both understand that we can't control the F.T.D. aspect of things.
*  After the wedding they took time off and traveled.
*  Better now than later, they thought.
*  Just as she embraced living with her father when being with Christy became impossible,
*  so now in the face of something extreme, she clung to what happiness she could find.
*  When she decided to start a family of her own, they had a tool available for not passing on F.T.D.
*  Selective embryo transfer.
*  C. could have her embryos frozen, and doctors could implant only the ones that did not have the mutation.
*  More than a year of arduous procedures followed.
*  Fertility treatments and embryo retrieval followed by four attempts to implant.
*  None of them successful.
*  My body did not like frozen embryos, she said.
*  She was readying herself for another retrieval and a fifth implantation when she found she'd become pregnant naturally.
*  This she told me wasn't planned.
*  Though given the difficulty they were having and conceiving, they weren't inclined to be vigilant about birth control.
*  She chuckled dryly when she told the story.
*  A life filled with unexpected twists gets one more.
*  She and her husband had all the obvious worries about the family mutation,
*  but by then they had plenty of practice playing through those fears.
*  Instead of fixating on what their child might inherit, C. thought about the clock ticking in more ways than one.
*  She was 36, and after four attempts it felt a little like now or never.
*  But everything she had lived through and everything that was coming she believed that good fortune was too precious to turn her back on.
*  Who's to say what other parents may be passing along to their children?
*  Genetic risks they don't know about and that no one can test for.
*  And more broadly, isn't she allowed to want this for herself?
*  Doesn't everyone have the right to a family?
*  Her aunts, uncles, and cousins all had to be wondering about the genetic implications of having children.
*  But the mutation casts a shadow over every interaction.
*  Those who have it are too preoccupied to question the choices of others,
*  and those who don't feel too guilty to second guess those who do.
*  Barb, for one, has never broached the subject with C.
*  This disease brings up so many moral and ethical questions Barb told me.
*  I think all of us have tried to refrain from judging.
*  C. now lives with her husband and son in a town not unlike where she grew up.
*  Her Christy raised her until she couldn't.
*  She is 40.
*  About the same age her mother was when she first started showing symptoms.
*  She sees Christian holidays, visiting her in Susan and Pittsburgh.
*  The rest of her time is spent trying to have a life of her own.
*  Her career is exciting, filled with problem solving.
*  Every day at her job is different and distractions abound.
*  Once a year along with many other members of her family,
*  she goes in for testing to chart the progress of the mutations effects.
*  MRIs, blood tests, neurological exams, cognitive tests, behavioral tests,
*  a lumbar puncture for brain fluid.
*  Recently, her doctor asked about her performance reviews at work.
*  I said, well, I'm not trying to brag or anything, but they're always really good.
*  The doctor's reply was sobering.
*  That's the first thing that's going to be a sign that you're getting it.
*  She nodded.
*  One more benchmarked consider, both useful and terrifying.
*  They have not tested their son for the mutation.
*  That, C. told me flatly, will be his decision.
*  He'll learn eventually that there's a possibility, she said.
*  I'm not going to ruin his life, you know, worrying about this.
*  And if her son is diagnosed one day, it's easy for her to daydream about
*  new genetic editing techniques like crisper, swooping into save him
*  with one simple, graceful, elegant snip, deleting the problematic mutation from his DNA.
*  No cure is imminent, but that can always change, see, tells herself.
*  I think that in the next 30, 40 years, there's going to be a lot of movement on this stuff,
*  she said.
*  I think he has a better chance than I do, and definitely more than my mom did.
*  Of course, it's probable that her son will be there to observe for changes,
*  just as she observed her mothers.
*  She and her husband have made arrangements with her father's help for any long-term care
*  she'll need.
*  Her genetic mutation clearly dictates certain things about her life,
*  but she maintains she still has choices.
*  Her choice is to decide to insist that her reality is not so different from others.
*  Even though I didn't really have a mom, you know, I love my husband, see, said.
*  I love my child, I love my dog, I love my career.
*  You know, I love my friends.
*  I love my family.
*  Am I going to focus on things that are bad?
*  None of us know how our stories will end, she was saying,
*  or what shape will be in by the time the end comes.
*  I guess another thing that I always kind of told myself growing up
*  was that everyone is given a certain amount to deal with in life,
*  and I'm dealing with it early, so the rest of my life is going to be great.
*  Barb had warned me about her sister, Jenny, that she hadn't accepted reality.
*  She thinks everything's just fine, she said.
*  Jenny is the eighth child, the sister closest in age to Barb, just 10 years older.
*  For many years, she was an executive with a Fortune 500 company.
*  She and her husband Bill, who works in finance, lived in a town outside New York
*  where they raised two children.
*  On Christie's life started to fall apart in 1995,
*  Jenny was the first one there, cleaning Christie's house and finding a neurologist.
*  Ben in 2010 at 43, Jenny learned she carried the mutation too.
*  She went on with life as if nothing had changed.
*  She did not disclose her diagnosis to her children who were still young.
*  She told some relatives she was going to fight it,
*  believing that changes to her lifestyle would stave off symptoms
*  and save her from the inevitable.
*  Scientists were close to a cure, she declared,
*  though there was in fact no such thing on the horizon,
*  which made some in her orbit wonder how far gone Jenny already was,
*  but she was so determined to remain herself that she told her co-workers about her diagnosis
*  and lost her job soon after that.
*  She hasn't been employed full-time since then.
*  Jenny and Bill live in a sprawling home at the end of a long wooded street.
*  Over lunch sitting next to Bill, Jenny was sunny and bright and chatty at first.
*  She was happy to talk about F.T.D. about her siblings and about the mutation,
*  but seemed unconcerned about the impact of the disease on her own life.
*  She had successfully adjusted her eating habits she explained to avoid getting F.T.D.
*  She was proud of the years she spent volunteering with an F.T.D. organization.
*  Counseling family members of others would be diagnosed.
*  I used to be the regional manager for this area,
*  basically the Northeast, she said,
*  but then they switched it over to somebody else.
*  Before long I noticed that Jenny was repeating a lot of phrases.
*  Whenever a sibling had F.T.D. they were out of their mind, like her sister Peggy,
*  a former schoolteacher who used to play fiddle in an Irish music ensemble
*  and solve complicated mathematical equations.
*  Now Peggy doesn't cook or drive and lives under the care of her longtime boyfriend.
*  Jenny is often felt competitive with Peggy,
*  and when she talks about her and some of the others, it is with an air of triumph.
*  I was the one who figured out that Mary had it,
*  and I was the one who figured out that Peggy had it.
*  Jenny said, I could see their change in behavior.
*  I asked Jenny and Bill if they thought Jenny was fired in 2010 because of F.T.D.
*  I think so, said Bill, thin and mild with a salt voice.
*  Jenny interjected, I don't think so.
*  No, no, I was really good at my job.
*  Mel you were, Bill said.
*  He sounded tentative, not sure of how to frame what he was going to say next.
*  But you know, they had this potential of you're not doing well further on down the road.
*  But I still don't have the disease, Jenny said flatly.
*  Bill winced, and Jenny turned to me, smiled and shrugged, as if to say, case closed.
*  So yeah.
*  Over time as we spoke, Jenny's answers grew shorter,
*  as if nothing we said was jogging new thoughts or leading her on new tangents.
*  Even her gleaming smiles started to strike me as limiting,
*  not an armor exactly, but a reflex, a placeholder for more complicated emotions.
*  There seemed to be little behind it but a dwindling tank of memories.
*  But Jenny maintained she was fine.
*  I'm a super deep sleeper, she told me.
*  What that does is it reduces inflammation of the brain.
*  It completely reduces the inflammation of the brain,
*  and so it keeps your brain really healthy.
*  She said she had proof.
*  Each year she's evaluated by the same specialist, Christy and C. C.
*  Jenny proudly showed me a printout of her latest cognition test report.
*  Bill seemed interested in the printout too.
*  I looked at the paper and saw several categories with the word decline.
*  When I pointed them out, Jenny just smiled and shrugged.
*  It's not really in decline, she told me.
*  It's just like my brain will play a game with me, and it like blocks memories sometimes.
*  I thought about Christy.
*  How for so long she has seemed unaware of her condition,
*  and how that is in some ways a blessing.
*  Not realizing that dementia is creeping into your life is not the worst thing in the world.
*  But for the people who love you, it can be not only horrifying, but depleting.
*  Both watching a tragedy and understanding how powerless you are to stop it.
*  Bill is at the precipice that the family crossed with Christy a long time ago.
*  He struggles to find a gentle way to help Jenny, to correct her,
*  without seeming overbearing, or otherwise outing himself as the caretaker he has clearly become.
*  But he knows that this is only going in one direction.
*  Even if he did come clean about the progress of her disease, he wonders what would change.
*  If she understands that something is a symptom, will it become less of an issue?
*  Bill said to me later, when we were alone.
*  I don't know.
*  Jenny and Bill's daughter, Anika, uses a Benjamin Button analogy when she thinks about FTT.
*  Whoever has it is aging backward, becoming not just dependent, but transformed.
*  Jenny had been a workaholic, competitive, and hard-driving.
*  After her diagnosis, she grew impulsive, just like the others.
*  She was drinking, Anika said.
*  It wasn't like she was an addict.
*  It's like she just wanted to do it to have fun, and she wanted to be sneaky about it.
*  She was acting like a teenager.
*  Now Anika says, her mother is consistently cheerful.
*  Everything will be fine, as Jenny's default position.
*  She spends most days watching TV and shopping for food,
*  visiting a number of different markets for exactly what she wants.
*  Anything more complex than that seems beyond her.
*  Anika is in her mid-20s and living in another city, starting her life.
*  She worries not just about her mother, but also her father, who has health issues of his own.
*  Who will care for her parents if he declines?
*  That question helps Anika put off for now the decision she will have to face about herself.
*  When to find out if she, too, carries the mutation.
*  Like Barb, she wants to put off reckoning with her fate, in the name of preserving
*  something supposedly more normal.
*  A few months after my visit, the family made some big decisions.
*  Bill and the children decided that Jenny couldn't be home alone anymore.
*  With Bill having to work at the office some days, he wants to hire an aide to watch Jenny.
*  He made plans to put the house in a trust and give the kids power of attorney over his health
*  and finances. He's looking into taking Jenny to get her driving evaluated,
*  with the hope that someone with the authority to tell her she can't drive will be enough to get her
*  to stop. Jenny has changed in the past months, too. She doesn't get upset or angry.
*  She's just, you know, communicating less, Bill said.
*  Often she just doesn't respond at all.
*  Still, Jenny doesn't believe she needs an aide, and it's hard to say how well she will listen to one.
*  What will happen when someone tells her not to drive, and she decides to do it anyway?
*  Well, that's a very good question. Bill said, his voice strained.
*  I mean, that just happened half an hour ago. She's at Walmart right now, by and groceries.
*  Barb was alone, standing in the front hall of her house when the letter arrived in September
*  26th, 2017. The letter probably shouldn't have existed at all. In most cases, results this
*  consequential are delivered in person. The author of the letter owned up to this. How normally this
*  is against their lab's policy, but given the results, they felt Barb really needed to see it.
*  Barb had spent eight years not knowing, and a full year dodging calls from the lab since being
*  tested. But this envelope was thick enough to prompt the thought, drifting in out of nowhere,
*  that maybe she shouldn't just throw it out. Even as she opened it and started reading,
*  Barb remained convinced of what it would say and what that would mean for her and everyone who
*  loved her. It didn't ever occur to me, she said, that I might get good news.
*  There was at first a wave of disbelief, then a call to her husband which made it more real.
*  The two of them cried together over the phone. That night, they told the kids everything.
*  They were 13 and 11 at the time. They knew some of their onset problems, but they were never told
*  what they were, and they had never asked. Barb sees now how strange that must have been for them
*  to learn about an illness that others in the family would get, but not them. We made them drink
*  champagne with us, Barb said. So they were like, cool, we get to drink champagne.
*  It has been a few years since that toast, enough time for Barb to think about the years she
*  spent putting off knowing. While she understands why she did it, she also now sees how even the
*  possibility of having F.T.D. had changed things for her, limited her world, blunted her ambition,
*  blotted out her sense of what was possible for herself and her family.
*  She thinks of moments at work where she didn't raise her hand, didn't try to accomplish more,
*  didn't want to assume authority because of the illness she might have, the symptoms that might
*  emerge any day. Would she have asked for more, expected more, if she'd been tested?
*  I think it probably held me back from applying for leadership positions because I was nervous
*  that maybe I wouldn't be able to finish the work or stay in it, make a multi-year commitment,
*  because what if this disease sets in, she said. I think it was all happening on a very subconscious
*  level. It wasn't until I found out that I didn't have it, and all of a sudden I felt so confident
*  in myself, and that's when I realized that I'd been feeling really unconfident for 10 years.
*  She sees how terrified she'd been not just for herself but for her husband and children,
*  the responsibilities they would have had to shoulder in caring for her, to say nothing of the
*  possibility that her children would also have the mutation. Now came the strange feeling that all
*  of that, everything she'd been negotiating in silence for so long had passed them all by,
*  like watching another car on the highway hop the guardrail and crash.
*  Next for Barb came the guilt and with a sense of obligation, instead of worrying about her own
*  mind and her children's, Barb spent her days thinking more about those in her family who were
*  suffering. It was hard to talk about me not having it with my siblings, she said.
*  Of the nine brothers and sisters, five now have active sides of FTD,
*  Christie, Mary, Jenny, Peggy, and Oliver, the fourth born, four years younger than Christie,
*  would be behaving strangely for many years until in his 60s he dropped out of sight during the
*  pandemic, homeless and off the grid for more than a year. These were people who decades ago had come
*  to care for Barb when she needed them the most, when their mother died. What will happen to them?
*  Whose responsibility were they now? I'd thought long and hard about what's my job here?
*  What's my role in the family, Barb said? Maybe if there was one sibling for me to care for,
*  I could do that, but now I'm looking at five potentially. How could I possibly take in five FTD
*  patients? And if I want to help one of them, how do I choose? Barb wondered whether the family could
*  ship in for a compound somewhere, a place where everyone could care for one another pooling resources.
*  It seemed too complicated to pull off with so many siblings having to uproot themselves.
*  There are also some who probably wouldn't want to be helped, including Oliver, who worked as a
*  trucker for years until he started having trouble holding onto a job. Like Mary, he developed a
*  habit of dropping in unannounced on relatives all over the country. Oliver is now an assisted living.
*  When he resurfaced at a hospital last year, Susan and an FU drove 22 hours to bring him to
*  Pittsburgh, and Barb navigated the Medicaid bureaucracy to help find him a place. His adult
*  daughter Mallory had persuaded him to grant her and Susan power of attorney a few years earlier.
*  But lately he has been turning away visitors. It's unclear if he is upset about being there,
*  where if his dementia has simply entered a new phase. Susan dropped off Christmas cookies,
*  but he would not come down to accept them. Mary's life also seems unsettled, while Christie's
*  become more docile over the years, the family is watched as Mary became more confrontational,
*  and even paranoid. She divorced a second time, and is now living with her third husband in the
*  Pittsburgh area. She has stopped returning calls from family members or going to medical
*  appointments with them. They have no way to know what kind of care she's getting.
*  Three of the nine siblings, Teddy, Mary, and Oliver, did not participate in this article.
*  There's a way in which the entire family has rearranged itself around the disease,
*  some drifting away geographically, others fading away cognitively, and still others who are
*  unscathed, desperately trying to hold it all together.
*  Last Thanksgiving, 15 members of the family gathered in the Adirondacks had a rented lodge with
*  a vaulted ceiling living room and massive stone fireplace, a family compound, at least for a few
*  days. Barb and her family were there, as was Kathy, the oldest sibling who doesn't carry the mutation,
*  and her son Charlie, also free of the mutation, along with his wife and son. Jenny and her family were
*  there too. Barb's children had not seen her in a while. Barb kept an eye on them, noticing them,
*  noticing the changes. They're finally seeing what I've been dealing with for 20 years,
*  Barb said. The saplings were afflicted and the sense of responsibility that carries.
*  Susan drove eight and a half hours with Christie beside her, in the lodge most of the family
*  played games while Christie sat in a soft easy chair by the fire, beaming it everyone.
*  I think she enjoys seeing other people in different faces. Susan told me a few weeks later,
*  just because I'm the only one that she sees most of the time.
*  I believe she remembers us, said Kathy, who lives an hour or so away from Christie and is an
*  occasional backup for Susan. I believe she recognizes us. This will be Susan's 27th consecutive year
*  as Christie's full-time caregiver. When Susan started, she was barely out of her 30s,
*  single and between careers. She did not expect her life to take this turn, and in all this time,
*  she has demonstrated a capacity for four parents that others in the family freely admit they lack,
*  a sort of secret reservoir of equanimity she can draw from in times of trouble.
*  Susan always saves the day in our family, Barb told me. Remarkably,
*  Susan has never been tested for the mutation. She too put off the decision for years,
*  until finally at 67, she assumes she simply does not have it. Instead, she remains focused on
*  caring for her sister. Every morning, Susan rises early, pulls the laundry out of the dryer,
*  tees up all the meals for the day, and makes herself some coffee before waking Christie.
*  And Susan coaxes her to the toilet, and then to the shower, things go more smoothly when they sing.
*  The morning I visited, it was, do you want to know a secret by the Beatles?
*  She knows the words, Susan said, though the most Christie offered up during my visit,
*  was a high boisterous humming noise on pitch. While Barb closely follows the progress of scientific
*  research into FTD, Susan is the emotional glue of the family now, staying close, not just with
*  siblings, but with nieces and nephews who are willing to help when they can. Over dinner,
*  Susan reflected on her time with Christie, but only in fits and starts. I'm not a saint,
*  she told me. This is devastating. When the talk shifted to Christie's doctors,
*  the conversation slowed down. There was something they weren't saying. Finally, Susan came out with it.
*  Christie has breast cancer, she said, just like their mother. That started about a year and a half ago.
*  There was a sore on her breast, and I just decided, you know, we're going to let it go.
*  Susan was grave when she discussed what that means. How wrangling Christie into a cancer treatment
*  regimen seems too much to ask of her. So they'll continue together for as long as it takes.
*  They had understood for a while that the genetic mutation that took over Christie's life
*  may not be what would take that life away. Now, after all this time, they know how her story will end.
