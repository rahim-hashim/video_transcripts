# The Sunday Read: ‘The Vanishing Family: Life in the Shadow of a Cruel Genetic Mutation’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wy7UAQJZMg)
*  Hi, I'm Robert Kolker and I'm a contributing writer to the New York Times magazine.
*  This is a story about a family.
*  There doesn't seem to be anything extraordinary about this particular family at all, except
*  maybe that there are a lot of siblings, nine to be exact.
*  They're just middle class Americans who mind their own business, a very ordinary family
*  that wants nothing more than to just stay ordinary.
*  And yet, each of them have something inside their genetic code that could severely curtail
*  of life and completely change the lives of everyone around them.
*  This week's Sunday Read is a story I wrote for the magazine about a family who learned
*  that they'd inherited a genetic mutation, one that causes a rare form of dementia.
*  It's something called FTD or frontotemporal dementia.
*  Even like Alzheimer's disease, FTD usually strikes in the prime of one's adult life.
*  You could be as young as, say, 40.
*  And it goes after the part of the brain responsible for planning, understanding social cues, and
*  making judgments.
*  In the beginning, you start to act impulsively.
*  You have weird conversations with strangers.
*  Then, your capacity for language starts to weaken.
*  You might have a master's degree and be an expert in something, but suddenly you're talking
*  like a fifth grader.
*  And then, as the years go on, your abilities get even more limited until, finally, you
*  can't even take care of yourself.
*  Diagnosing this rare condition is extremely difficult, and there's currently no cure.
*  It was horrifying and catastrophic for this family to learn that each of them has a 50%
*  chance, a coin flip, of having the genetic mutation for FTD.
*  But then what happened next was even more surprising, which was that some of them decided
*  not to get tested.
*  They didn't want to know just yet.
*  For some of them, the only thing to do was to continue living their lives because you
*  can't do anything about it anyway.
*  Still, that anxiety completely took up their days.
*  It's like walking around saying, don't think of elephants.
*  Suddenly you're thinking about elephants.
*  And so it becomes this moral conundrum.
*  Do you need to tell your partner if you carry this genetic mutation?
*  Do you have children?
*  And if you do, do you let them know that they might be afflicted with a debilitating disease
*  much later in life?
*  When would you even tell them?
*  When I started writing about this family, I wondered how much of this family's affliction
*  would actually translate outside of their particular experience.
*  But what I found was that their dilemma was quite relatable.
*  We all wonder what the future holds.
*  Whether it's high cholesterol or a relative having cancer, we all wonder about what we
*  would or wouldn't want to know about our genetic destinies.
*  About a year ago, I heard from the youngest of these nine siblings, a woman in her forties
*  named Barb.
*  I met with her personally and we spoke at length.
*  The story Barb told me begins 30 years earlier when one of her sisters started to experience
*  strange symptoms.
*  This is her family's story.
*  The Vanishing Family, read by Eduardo Ballerini.
*  Barb was the youngest in her large Irish Catholic family.
*  A surprise baby, the ninth child, born ten years after the eighth.
*  Living in the suburbs of Pittsburgh, her family followed the football schedule.
*  High school games on Friday night, college games on Saturday, the Steelers on Sunday.
*  Dad was an engineer, mom was a homemaker, and Barb was the family mascot.
*  Blonde and adorable, watching her brothers and sisters finish school and go on to their
*  careers.
*  Barb was the only child left at home in the 1980s to witness the seams of her parents'
*  marriage come apart.
*  Her father all but left, and her mother turned inward, sitting quietly in front of the television,
*  always smoking, often with a cocktail.
*  Everything had overtaken her, though it wasn't clear what.
*  Barb observed it all with a measure of detachment.
*  Her parents had been older than most, and her sisters and brothers supplied more than
*  enough parental energy to make up the difference.
*  And so in 1990, when Barb was 14 and her mother learned she had breast cancer and died within
*  months at the age of 62, Barb was shattered and bewildered, but also protected.
*  Her siblings had already stepped in, three of them living back home.
*  Together they arrived at a shared understanding of the tragedy.
*  Their mother could have lived longer if she had cut back on her drinking sooner, or gone
*  to see a doctor, or hadn't smoked.
*  Six years later, Barb was 20 and in college when someone else in the family needed help.
*  Her sister Christy was the second born, 24 years older than Barb, and the star of the
*  family in many ways.
*  She had traveled extensively as a pharmaceutical company executive while raising two children
*  with her husband in a nice house in a New Jersey suburb.
*  But where once Christy was capable and professionally ambitious and socially conscious, now at 44,
*  she was alone, her clothes unkempt and ripped, her hair unwashed, her marriage over.
*  Again the family came together.
*  Susan, the third born, volunteered to take care of Christy full time, and Jenny, the
*  eighth, searched for a specialist.
*  The family members asked to be identified by their first names to protect their privacy.
*  Depression was the first suspected diagnosis, then schizophrenia, though neither seemed
*  quite right.
*  Christy wasn't sad or delusional, she wasn't even upset.
*  It was more as if she were reverting to a childlike state, losing her knack for self-regulation.
*  Her personality was diluting.
*  On its way out was seemingly nothing to replace it.
*  What was left of Christy was chaotic and unpredictable.
*  She refused to bathe and stopped bothering to make meals.
*  She crashed a neighbor's party and made odd conversation with strangers.
*  She clogged a toilet with tampons and flooded the house.
*  She was gleefully impulsive, spending thousands of dollars a year on magazine subscriptions.
*  That strange reckless profligacy made Barb think of their mother, who in her final years
*  sat at home, saying yes to every sales phone call.
*  How heartbreaking, but also interesting, Barb thought, that Christy shared the same peculiar
*  tendencies, a family trait of sorts.
*  By 2006, Barb was long out of college in her early 30s and married with two children,
*  building a real estate career in Denver.
*  One night when she was putting the kids to bed, her phone rang.
*  It was Mary, the fifthborn, 17 years older than Barb, in town unannounced.
*  Can you come pick me up?
*  She said.
*  Mary had always been one of Barb's favorite siblings.
*  As a child, she was a piano prodigy, precocious and outgoing,
*  her gaze fixed on a future beyond her hometown.
*  Mary grew up to be a mass transportation engineer,
*  consulting on projects from New Orleans to Abu Dhabi.
*  She and her fiance lived in Chicago, where Barb, then in her 20s,
*  would visit, joining them for parties and nights out.
*  But in recent years, things had changed for Mary.
*  She was divorced and remarried with a young son, living in Omaha and
*  only in occasional contact with the family.
*  And here she was, where Barb lived, with no explanation.
*  That weekend, Barb saw it all, the same movie playing again.
*  Mary's affect was flat, far from the irrepressible sister she once was.
*  Everyday courtesies seemed beyond her.
*  She was in town for a work trip, she said, but
*  hadn't bothered to book a place to stay or let Barb know in advance.
*  When she talked about the project she was about to manage,
*  it was with the language of a middle or high schooler,
*  not someone with a master's degree and years of expertise.
*  As soon as Mary left, Barb called Mary's husband, who was at his wit's end.
*  Mary had never really bonded with their son, he said.
*  She seemed disengaged from everything around her.
*  The old Mary was disappearing, with nothing to replace her.
*  That's when everything cascaded for Barb.
*  What the affliction was, exactly, she didn't know.
*  No one did.
*  But two of her sisters had the same thing that must have so
*  drastically altered their mother.
*  This is genetic, she thought.
*  This is inherited.
*  And then finally, we all might have it.
*  The others ignored Barb's concerns.
*  It wasn't just that she was the youngest in the family and
*  more easily dismissed.
*  It was that a few years earlier,
*  Cresty had participated in some genetic tests with the University of California,
*  San Francisco, that had gone nowhere.
*  Based on all the available knowledge about inherited brain disease,
*  the specialist could not find an explanation for her changing behavior.
*  But now Barb fixated on exactly what they were told.
*  How the field was in its infancy, and
*  how just because they couldn't find a genetic marker, didn't mean one wasn't there.
*  Barb decided to start a search of her own.
*  She contacted the National Institutes of Health and
*  learned about a condition that bore a striking resemblance to Cresty's and
*  Mary's symptoms, frontotemporal dementia, or FTD, which emerges in the prime of
*  adult life, as young as 40 in some cases, and relentlessly attacks the part of
*  the brain responsible for planning, organizing, expressing language,
*  understanding social cues, and exercising judgment.
*  Unlike more common brain disorders like Alzheimer's, FTD is confoundingly rare.
*  Researchers suggest that perhaps 60,000 Americans have it,
*  though that estimate is complicated by how difficult it is to diagnose.
*  By the mid aughts, researchers were still starting to identify and
*  sort out the many varieties of FTD.
*  Which were hereditary?
*  Which weren't?
*  How many were yet to be found?
*  Bruce Willis's family said they finally arrived at a diagnosis of FTD recently
*  after an earlier provisional explanation of aphasia, a condition that impacts speech,
*  but have not disclosed whether his FTD is inherited.
*  The idea that the FTD field was still developing and
*  the knowledge base growing only made Barb more determined.
*  In December 2006, she asked everyone in the family, including their father,
*  to provide blood samples for a new round of analysis.
*  Cresty, Jenny, and Susan agreed.
*  The researchers failed to find any known FTD mutations,
*  not surprising in retrospect given the limited number of samples.
*  Barb's contact at the NIH encouraged her to continue testing through
*  the Mayo Clinic.
*  The family remained in the dark, even as they watched Mary follow
*  Christie's trajectory, losing all social awareness, defying common sense.
*  Then the following year, a new piece of information arrived from out of the blue.
*  When Teddy, the seventh sibling, 11 years older than Barb,
*  forwarded an email from a woman trying to track down distant relatives who might
*  share the same medical problem her family seemed to be suffering from.
*  The message included a photograph of the sibling's grandfather,
*  a shared genetic ancestor on their mother's side of the family.
*  We had no idea that branch of the family existed, Barb said.
*  I mean, it was crazy.
*  The medical problem, the woman explained later on the phone, was FTD.
*  With equal parts awe and dread, Barb contacted the Mayo Clinic,
*  which tested both families, two strains of the same gene pool.
*  All of Barb's siblings participated this time,
*  gathering there in person, as well as some adult grandchildren.
*  With so many samples spanning several generations in different wings of
*  the family, the researchers had a better trail to follow.
*  Sure enough, the families had a mutation of the tau protein,
*  which is now understood to be one of three major brain proteins
*  associated with inherited FTD.
*  When they came in with the news, you could tell they were related, Barb said.
*  I think that's how uncommon it is to find.
*  Of course, it was also a catastrophe.
*  There is no bright side to any FTD diagnosis, no cure, no path forward.
*  With very few exceptions, everyone who inherits the mutation will,
*  like Christy and Mary, long before their old age,
*  develop inappropriate social behavior and lose the ability to earn an income,
*  look after their children, do household chores, or take care of their hygiene.
*  They will eventually be unable to speak, feed or dress themselves, or
*  use the bathroom on their own.
*  This is the case with Christy, who at 71 spends most days in front of the TV and
*  has an Apple AirTag clipped to a sneaker in case she wanders off.
*  The decline may be swift, but the end may not be.
*  Unlike Alzheimer's patients, who largely are diagnosed when they're elderly,
*  people with FTD can potentially live many years after becoming symptomatic,
*  requiring decades of care.
*  And their children, all their descendants, might carry the mutation too.
*  Every sibling, except Susan, had children of their own.
*  Kathy, the eldest, had a grandchild.
*  They had all inherited, in essence, a coin flip,
*  a 50% chance that they carry the mutation.
*  Those who don't carry it are in the clear, and so are their descendants.
*  Those who do will develop FTD, and
*  they pass along that same 50% risk to each of their children.
*  I had a four-year-old and a two-year-old at that time, Barb told me.
*  And I remember thinking, I shouldn't have had my kids.
*  She stopped short as she recalled this, then collected herself.
*  Which is like a very hard thing for a parent to think.
*  It's a devastating feeling,
*  that I may have passed something to them that could hurt them.
*  Even now, many in the family struggle with how to explain the impossible situation
*  they found themselves in.
*  An earthquake or hurricane or war comes close,
*  only a strange science fiction version.
*  Something not visible or experienced by anyone but them.
*  A disaster existing only inside their family's genetic code.
*  There were the facts, it's inherited, anyone might have it, and
*  there were the deeper questions raised by those facts.
*  How do you feel safe, knowing that it is in your family's essential nature to be
*  fragile, ephemeral, ever close to expiration?
*  How do you keep living when you know that everything that makes you a conscious
*  person could disappear?
*  If you were going to lose yourself in a year or two or ten,
*  would you even want to know?
*  Once the researchers found the mutation, they encouraged each family member to
*  test at an independent lab to learn who carried it.
*  Everyone in the family could discover which side of the coin flip they landed.
*  But not everyone did.
*  Teddy said he was never going back to the Mayo Clinic again, and he hasn't.
*  Even Barb, who had been cajoling the others to get tested,
*  could not bring herself to do so.
*  Her future seemed like a forked road with no good options.
*  Turn one way, you become essentially a shadow version of yourself, and
*  everyone you love has to spend their lives taking care of you.
*  Turn the other, and you still have to say goodbye,
*  slowly, to some of the people you love the most.
*  Why not do whatever you could not to engage in that strange binary choice?
*  And so Barb decided not to decide.
*  She was 32 when the family learned about the mutation in 2008.
*  Even if she did have FTD, she most likely would not present symptoms for
*  at least a decade.
*  She would give herself until her early 40s to take action.
*  I figured, okay, I've got maybe ten good years left, she said.
*  Others in the family would take priority for now.
*  The siblings I was closest with, they all raised me practically, so
*  my immediate concern was for them.
*  Just, you know, how many more people am I going to lose from this disease in
*  the next few years?
*  As long as Barb didn't know if she had it,
*  she would try to live as if she didn't.
*  This was especially important to her because she spent her childhood watching
*  her mother decline and then die.
*  I know that I did not grow up with a normal childhood, Barb said.
*  I wanted to give my kids as normal a childhood as possible.
*  If I knew I was destined to get this horrible disease,
*  how normal would it have been?
*  Of course, not being tested wasn't the same as not having the disease.
*  How could it be?
*  Barb entered a limbo, uncertainty hovering over her.
*  Waking life became a continuous test of cognition,
*  one chance after another to wonder if she was losing it.
*  Literally everything in a given day that goes wrong.
*  If you forget someone's name, or you lose your keys, or
*  you do something embarrassing, your mind instantly goes to, this is it,
*  this is the beginning, it's starting.
*  It just totally messes with you.
*  It's exhausting.
*  She was vigilant in policing those thoughts,
*  trying to keep the worst ones at bay, even shielding her husband.
*  He told me in a highly convincing way that no matter what happens to me,
*  he's going to be with me until the end, she said.
*  But you know, there were a lot of times where I was dealing with that emotional
*  stress alone, because I didn't want to burden him with it.
*  Her husband, meanwhile, took action of his own, changing careers,
*  training to be a lawyer to ensure he would make enough to support them.
*  Only years later would they talk explicitly about what he had done.
*  It was a huge sacrifice that he made, Barb said.
*  As time went on and the pretense of normalcy became harder to maintain,
*  Barb still tried to keep her children from hearing about FTD, even though they,
*  like her, might possibly have the mutation, and even though it would be impossible to
*  keep that information from them as they grew older.
*  She also followed new research on FTD and Alzheimer's, two distinct diseases,
*  each incurable, that attack brain function, but with remarkably different
*  genetic properties, and fell into despair as no treatments for FTD emerged.
*  She emerged from that research.
*  Then, as Barb watched Christy and Mary decline further, and two more sisters
*  learned they had the mutation, Jenny in 2010, Peggy in 2015,
*  the sense that something was coming for her became impossible to ignore.
*  In 2016, with her 40th birthday closing in,
*  Barb became certain that she did, in fact, have it.
*  She began bracing for the worst, living as if her days were numbered.
*  Eight years after the Mayo Clinic issued its diagnosis, Barb was tested,
*  going in for the blood draw that would tell the story of the rest of her life.
*  The clinicians required patients to receive the news, good or bad, in person.
*  But Barb never went back to hear the results.
*  Like Barb, Christy's daughter didn't want to find out right away.
*  She knew there was a 50% chance of having it.
*  Her mother had long succumbed to the disease, transforming right before her eyes.
*  She was 12 when her mother's condition became impossible to ignore,
*  when Christy stopped bathing, or shopping, or making meals.
*  At the time, Christy's daughter, who asked to be identified by her first initial, C,
*  was frightened, not least because of how alone she was.
*  Her father was divorcing her mother and had moved to a neighboring town.
*  And her brother was not yet eight,
*  too young to register some of the things that she understood to be obviously wrong.
*  Even now, she finds it hard to talk about that time in her life.
*  Driving home once with her, she got a flat tire, and she just kept driving, she told me.
*  I was like, Mom, you know, you've got to pull over.
*  It was up to her to raise the alarm with her father.
*  I remember a pipe burst in our house, and she didn't get it repaired.
*  We didn't have water for days.
*  I was just like, Dad, we can't live like this.
*  The children moved in with him when she was 13, and Susan moved in with Christy.
*  C's father has helped financially support Christy's care ever since.
*  Today, C is protective of her father.
*  He tried to get her help, she said.
*  He had reached out to my grandfather, my mom's dad, and said,
*  something's wrong with Christy, something's changing.
*  And he just brushed it off.
*  She is equally protective of her own privacy.
*  She mentioned, and several others in the family told me this,
*  that two of her aunts lost their jobs after speaking openly about their family's illness.
*  She is also charitable toward Christy.
*  I do remember her being a wonderful person, just fun and active, she said.
*  But those happier memories seem less accessible to see now,
*  overshadowed by everything that occurred after the disease took over.
*  During her teenage years,
*  she watched from a distance as her aunt Susan handled a host of challenges.
*  Christy owed the IRS $10,000 in back taxes.
*  Christy ballooned to 250 pounds until Susan finally padlocked the refrigerator.
*  Once, Christy bolted from the mall on a shopping trip and
*  wandered five miles in the cold and rain to a Wendy's,
*  where the police were called and bought her dinner.
*  Susan was in tears when she caught up with her.
*  But Christy was fine, unfazed, even cheerful.
*  During C's visits, she could see for
*  herself her mother's mysterious, almost random new personality.
*  Once in front of C's boyfriend, Christy asked C whether she was sleeping with
*  David Hasselhoff, the star of Baywatch, Christy's favorite show at the time.
*  Watching her mother become so unrecognizable was excruciating.
*  But with Susan looking after Christy, C was at least free to be a teenager,
*  to go to school, to one day start a life of her own.
*  Once she was in her mid-20s, building a career, that might have been that.
*  Her mother's tragic disease, a difficult childhood, a safe landing with her father.
*  Then her family learned about FTD.
*  While others, particularly her older relatives, lined up for genetic tests,
*  she, like Barb, froze in place, deciding that she didn't want to know.
*  She wanted to give herself time.
*  I was just like, if I find out I have this right now,
*  I'm not going to have any motivation, she said.
*  I'm not going to have any desire to move forward.
*  She made a bargain with herself.
*  She would be tested in five years, when she turned 30.
*  For her, the decision to delay knowing felt less like denial than a play for
*  personal agency, for control over something she had no control over.
*  For those five years, C worked hard not to think about the family's condition,
*  to move forward as if it wasn't there.
*  Pretending was even less possible for her than for Barb,
*  when the example of her own mother was always present, directly in front of her,
*  living with full-time care, losing her ability to speak, losing herself.
*  When C turned 30, she had a boyfriend, a serious one,
*  whom she told about the risk of FTD almost as soon as they started dating
*  several years earlier.
*  Now they were engaged.
*  She went through with her plan to find out the truth.
*  I wanted him to have the choice to opt out if he didn't want to deal with me,
*  she said.
*  They were together when she learned the news.
*  Her boyfriend held her hand, no words passing between them.
*  I remember even the genetic therapist saying, you guys are just like,
*  such a great couple.
*  I'm so sorry I have to tell you this.
*  C approaches her life with a brass tacks practicality.
*  Others have it worse than me, as a frequent conversational landing place for her,
*  as is, it is what it is.
*  After a childhood of instability and an adulthood of deep pervasive uncertainty,
*  she is determined not to waste energy on what she can't change,
*  or pull her focus away from a life she loves.
*  She sees the world in this way, it seems, even if that means shaping complex
*  situations in simpler terms, a sort of emotional firewall around the FTD diagnosis.
*  Her husband has become a good partner in maintaining that firewall.
*  They were married, as they had planned.
*  He had already seen my family, she said, smiling.
*  So I guess he kind of knew what he was getting into.
*  Together, they sorted through everything they could control.
*  We talked about long term care insurance and genetic testing for kids, she said.
*  But I think we both understand that we can't control the FTD aspect of things.
*  After the wedding, they took time off and traveled.
*  Better now than later, they thought.
*  Just as she embraced living with her father when being with Christy became
*  impossible, so now, in the face of something extreme,
*  she clung to what happiness she could find.
*  When she decided to start a family of her own, they had a tool available for
*  not passing on FTD, selective embryo transfer.
*  See could have her embryos frozen, and
*  doctors could implant only the ones that did not have the mutation.
*  More than a year of arduous procedures followed, fertility treatments and
*  embryo retrieval followed by four attempts to implant, none of them successful.
*  My body did not like frozen embryos, See said.
*  She was readying herself for another retrieval and
*  a fifth implantation when she found she'd become pregnant naturally.
*  This, she told me, wasn't planned.
*  Though given the difficulty they were having in conceiving,
*  they weren't inclined to be vigilant about birth control.
*  She chuckled dryly when she told the story.
*  A life filled with unexpected twists gets one more.
*  She and her husband had all the obvious worries about the family mutation, but
*  by then they had plenty of practice playing through those fears.
*  Instead of fixating on what their child might inherit,
*  See thought about the clock ticking in more ways than one.
*  She was 36, and after four attempts, it felt a little like now or never.
*  With everything she had lived through and everything that was coming,
*  she believed that good fortune was too precious to turn her back on.
*  Who's to say what other parents may be passing along to their children?
*  Genetic risks they don't know about and that no one can test for.
*  And more broadly, isn't she allowed to want this for herself?
*  Doesn't everyone have the right to a family?
*  Her aunts, uncles, and cousins all had to be wondering about the genetic
*  implications of having children.
*  But the mutation casts a shadow over every interaction.
*  Those who have it are too preoccupied to question the choices of others, and
*  those who don't feel too guilty to second guess those who do.
*  Barb, for one, has never broached the subject with See.
*  This disease brings up so many moral and ethical questions, Barb told me.
*  I think all of us have tried to refrain from judging.
*  See now lives with her husband and son in a town not unlike where she grew up,
*  where Christie raised her until she couldn't.
*  She is 40, about the same age her mother was when she first started showing
*  symptoms.
*  She sees Christie on holidays, visiting her and Susan in Pittsburgh.
*  The rest of her time is spent trying to have a life of her own.
*  Her career is exciting, filled with problem solving.
*  Every day at her job is different and distractions abound.
*  Once a year, along with many other members of her family,
*  she goes in for testing to chart the progress of the mutation's effects.
*  MRIs, blood tests, neurological exams, cognitive tests,
*  behavioral tests, a lumbar puncture for brain fluid.
*  Recently, her doctor asked about her performance reviews at work.
*  I said, well, I'm not trying to brag or anything, but they're always really good.
*  The doctor's reply was sobering.
*  That's the first thing that's going to be a sign that you're getting it.
*  She nodded.
*  One more benchmark to consider, both useful and terrifying.
*  They have not tested their son for the mutation.
*  That, she told me flatly, will be his decision.
*  He'll learn eventually that there's a possibility, she said.
*  I'm not going to ruin his life, you know, worrying about this.
*  And if her son is diagnosed one day, it's easy for
*  her to daydream about new genetic editing techniques like CRISPR
*  swooping in to save him with one simple graceful elegant snip,
*  deleting the problematic mutation from his DNA.
*  No cure is imminent, but that can always change, C tells herself.
*  I think that in the next 30, 40 years,
*  there's going to be a lot of movement on this stuff, she said.
*  I think he has a better chance than I do, and definitely more than my mom did.
*  Of course, it's probable that her son will be there to observe her changes,
*  just as she observed her mother's.
*  She and her husband have made arrangements with her father's help for
*  any long term care she'll need.
*  Her genetic mutation clearly dictates certain things about her life, but
*  she maintains she still has choices.
*  Her choice is to decide to insist that her reality is not so
*  different from others.
*  Even though I didn't really have a mom, you know, I love my husband, C said.
*  I love my child.
*  I love my dog.
*  I love my career.
*  You know, I love my friends.
*  I love my family.
*  Am I going to focus on things that are bad?
*  None of us know how our stories will end, she was saying, or
*  what shape we'll be in by the time the end comes.
*  I guess another thing that I always kind of told myself growing up was that
*  everyone is given a certain amount to deal with in life.
*  And I'm dealing with it early, so the rest of my life is going to be great.
*  Barb had warned me about her sister Jenny,
*  that she hadn't accepted reality.
*  She thinks everything's just fine, she said.
*  Jenny is the eighth child, the sister closest in age to Barb, just ten years older.
*  For many years, she was an executive with a Fortune 500 company.
*  She and her husband Bill, who works in finance,
*  lived in a town outside New York where they raised two children.
*  When Christie's life started to fall apart in 1995,
*  Jenny was the first one there, cleaning Christie's house and finding a neurologist.
*  Then in 2010, at 43, Jenny learned she carried the mutation too.
*  She went on with life as if nothing had changed.
*  She did not disclose her diagnosis to her children who were still young.
*  She told some relatives she was going to fight it,
*  believing that changes to her lifestyle would stave off symptoms and
*  save her from the inevitable.
*  Scientists were close to a cure, she declared, though there was, in fact,
*  no such thing on the horizon, which made some in her orbit wonder how far gone
*  Jenny already was.
*  But she was so determined to remain herself that she told her coworkers about
*  her diagnosis and lost her job soon after that.
*  She hasn't been employed full time since then.
*  Jenny and Bill live in a sprawling home at the end of a long, wooded street.
*  Over lunch, sitting next to Bill, Jenny was sunny and bright and chatty at first.
*  She was happy to talk about FTD, about her siblings, and about the mutation,
*  but seemed unconcerned about the impact of the disease on her own life.
*  She had successfully adjusted her eating habits, she explained,
*  to avoid getting FTD.
*  She was proud of the years she spent volunteering with an FTD organization,
*  counseling family members of others who had been diagnosed.
*  I used to be the regional manager for this area, basically the northeast,
*  she said, but then they switched it over to somebody else.
*  Before long, I noticed that Jenny was repeating a lot of phrases.
*  Whenever a sibling had FTD, they were out of their mind, like her sister Peggy,
*  a former school teacher who used to play fiddle in an Irish music ensemble and
*  solve complicated mathematical equations.
*  Now Peggy doesn't cook or drive and lives under the care of her longtime boyfriend.
*  Jenny has often felt competitive with Peggy, and
*  when she talks about her and some of the others, it is with an air of triumph.
*  I was the one who figured out that Mary had it, and
*  I was the one who figured out that Peggy had it, Jenny said.
*  I could see their change in behavior.
*  I asked Jenny and Bill if they thought Jenny was fired in 2010 because of FTD.
*  I think so, said Bill, thin and mild, with a soft voice.
*  Jenny interjected, I don't think so, no, no, I was really good at my job.
*  No, you were, Bill said.
*  He sounded tentative, not sure of how to frame what he was going to say next.
*  But you know, they had this potential of you're not doing well further on down
*  the road.
*  But I still don't have the disease, Jenny said flatly.
*  Bill winced, and Jenny turned to me, smiled and shrugged, as if to say, case closed.
*  So yeah.
*  Over time as we spoke, Jenny's answers grew shorter,
*  as if nothing we said was jogging new thoughts or leading her on new tangents.
*  Even her gleaming smile started to strike me as limiting.
*  Not an armor exactly, but a reflex, a placeholder for more complicated emotions.
*  There seemed to be little behind it but a dwindling tank of memories.
*  But Jenny maintained she was fine.
*  I'm a super deep sleeper, she told me.
*  What that does is it reduces inflammation of the brain.
*  It completely reduces the inflammation of the brain, and
*  so it keeps your brain really healthy.
*  She said she had proof.
*  Each year she's evaluated by the same specialist, Christy and CC.
*  Jenny proudly showed me a printout of her latest cognition test report.
*  Bill seemed interested in the printout too.
*  I looked at the paper and saw several categories with the word decline.
*  When I pointed them out, Jenny just smiled and shrugged.
*  It's not really in decline, she told me.
*  It's just like my brain will play a game with me, and
*  it like blocks memories sometimes.
*  I thought about Christy, how for so long she has seemed unaware of her condition,
*  and how that is in some ways a blessing.
*  Not realizing that dementia is creeping into your life is not the worst thing in
*  the world.
*  But for the people who love you, it can be not only horrifying but depleting.
*  Both watching a tragedy and understanding how powerless you are to stop it.
*  Bill is at the precipice that the family crossed with Christy a long time ago.
*  He struggles to find a gentle way to help Jenny, to correct her without seeming
*  overbearing or otherwise outing himself as the caretaker he has clearly become.
*  But he knows that this is only going in one direction.
*  Even if he did come clean about the progress of her disease,
*  he wonders what would change.
*  If she understands that something is a symptom, will it become less of an issue,
*  Bill said to me later when we were alone?
*  I don't know.
*  Jenny and Bill's daughter, Annika, uses a Benjamin Button analogy when she thinks
*  about FTD.
*  Whoever has it is aging backward, becoming not just dependent but transformed.
*  Jenny had been a workaholic, competitive, and hard driving.
*  After her diagnosis, she grew impulsive, just like the others.
*  She was drinking, Annika said.
*  It wasn't like she was an addict.
*  It's like she just wanted to do it to have fun, and
*  she wanted to be sneaky about it.
*  She was acting like a teenager.
*  Now, Annika says, her mother is consistently cheerful.
*  Everything will be fine, is Jenny's default position.
*  She spends most days watching TV and shopping for food,
*  visiting a number of different markets for exactly what she wants.
*  Anything more complex than that seems beyond her.
*  Annika is in her mid-20s and living in another city, starting her life.
*  She worries not just about her mother, but
*  also her father, who has health issues of his own.
*  Who will care for her parents if he declines?
*  That question helps Annika put off, for now,
*  the decision she will have to face about herself.
*  When to find out if she, too, carries the mutation?
*  Like Barb, she wants to put off reckoning with her fate
*  in the name of preserving something supposedly more normal.
*  A few months after my visit, the family made some big decisions.
*  Bill and the children decided that Jenny couldn't be home alone anymore.
*  With Bill having to work at the office some days,
*  he wants to hire an aide to watch Jenny.
*  He made plans to put the house in a trust and
*  give the kids power of attorney over his health and finances.
*  He's looking into taking Jenny to get her driving evaluated,
*  with the hope that someone with the authority to tell her she can't drive
*  will be enough to get her to stop.
*  Jenny has changed in the past months, too.
*  She doesn't get upset or angry.
*  She's just, you know, communicating less, Bill said.
*  Often she just doesn't respond at all.
*  Still, Jenny doesn't believe she needs an aide, and
*  it's hard to say how well she will listen to one.
*  What will happen when someone tells her not to drive, and
*  she decides to do it anyway?
*  Well, that's a very good question, Bill said, his voice strained.
*  I mean, that just happened half an hour ago.
*  She's at Walmart right now, buying groceries.
*  Barb was alone, standing in the front hall of her house,
*  when the letter arrived on September 26th, 2017.
*  The letter probably shouldn't have existed at all.
*  In most cases, results this consequential are delivered in person.
*  The author of the letter owned up to this.
*  Now normally this is against their lab's policy, but
*  given the results, they felt Barb really needed to see it.
*  Barb had spent eight years not knowing, and
*  a full year dodging calls from the lab since being tested.
*  But this envelope was thick enough to prompt the thought,
*  drifting in out of nowhere, that maybe she shouldn't just throw it out.
*  Even as she opened it and started reading, Barb remained convinced of what it would
*  say, and what that would mean for her and everyone who loved her.
*  It didn't ever occur to me, she said, that I might get good news.
*  There was at first a wave of disbelief,
*  then a call to her husband, which made it more real.
*  The two of them cried together over the phone.
*  That night they told the kids everything.
*  They were 13 and 11 at the time.
*  They knew some of their aunts had problems, but they were never told what they were,
*  and they had never asked.
*  Barb sees now how strange that must have been for
*  them to learn about an illness that others in the family would get, but not them.
*  We made them drink champagne with us, Barb said.
*  So they were like, cool, we get to drink champagne.
*  It has been a few years since that toast, enough time for
*  Barb to think about the years she spent putting off knowing.
*  While she understands why she did it, she also now sees how even the possibility of
*  having FTD had changed things for her, limited her world, blunted her ambition,
*  blotted out her sense of what was possible for herself and her family.
*  She thinks of moments at work where she didn't raise her hand,
*  didn't try to accomplish more, didn't want to assume authority
*  because of the illness she might have, the symptoms that might emerge any day.
*  Would she have asked for more, expected more, if she'd been tested?
*  I think it probably held me back from applying for leadership positions,
*  because I was nervous that maybe I wouldn't be able to finish the work or
*  stay in it, make a multi-year commitment, because what if this disease sets in?
*  She said.
*  I think it was all happening on a very subconscious level.
*  It wasn't until I found out that I didn't have it, and all of a sudden,
*  I felt so confident in myself.
*  And that's when I realized that I'd been feeling really
*  unconfident for ten years.
*  She sees how terrified she'd been not just for herself, but for her husband and
*  children, the responsibilities they would have had to shoulder in caring for her,
*  to say nothing of the possibility that her children would also have the mutation.
*  Now came the strange feeling that all of that, everything she'd been negotiating in
*  silence for so long, had passed them all by, like watching another car on the highway
*  hop the guardrail and crash.
*  Next for Barb came the guilt, and with it a sense of obligation.
*  Instead of worrying about her own mind and her children's,
*  Barb spent her days thinking more about those in her family who were suffering.
*  It was hard to talk about me not having it with my siblings, she said.
*  Of the nine brothers and sisters, five now have active signs of FTD.
*  Christy, Mary, Jenny, Peggy, and Oliver, the fourth born,
*  four years younger than Christy, who had been behaving strangely for many years
*  until, in his 60s, he dropped out of sight during the pandemic,
*  homeless and off the grid for more than a year.
*  These were people who, decades ago,
*  had come to care for Barb when she needed them the most, when their mother died.
*  What will happen to them?
*  Whose responsibility were they now?
*  I'd thought long and hard about what's my job here?
*  What's my role in the family, Barb said.
*  Maybe if there was one sibling for me to care for, I could do that.
*  But now I'm looking at five, potentially.
*  How could I possibly take in five FTD patients?
*  And if I want to help one of them, how do I choose?
*  Barb wondered whether the family could chip in for a compound somewhere,
*  a place where everyone could care for one another, pooling resources.
*  It seemed too complicated to pull off, with so
*  many siblings having to uproot themselves.
*  There are also some who probably wouldn't want to be helped,
*  including Oliver, who worked as a trucker for
*  years until he started having trouble holding onto a job.
*  Like Mary, he developed a habit of dropping in unannounced on relatives all
*  over the country.
*  Oliver is now in assisted living.
*  When he resurfaced at a hospital last year, Susan and
*  a nephew drove 22 hours to bring him to Pittsburgh.
*  And Barb navigated the Medicaid bureaucracy to help find him a place.
*  His adult daughter, Mallory, had persuaded him to grant her and
*  Susan power of attorney a few years earlier.
*  But lately, he has been turning away visitors.
*  It's unclear if he is upset about being there or
*  if his dementia has simply entered a new phase.
*  Susan dropped off Christmas cookies, but he would not come down to accept them.
*  Mary's life also seems unsettled.
*  While Christy has become more docile over the years,
*  the family is watched as Mary became more confrontational and even paranoid.
*  She divorced a second time and
*  is now living with her third husband in the Pittsburgh area.
*  She has stopped returning calls from family members or
*  going to medical appointments with them.
*  They have no way to know what kind of care she's getting.
*  Three of the nine siblings, Teddy, Mary, and Oliver,
*  did not participate in this article.
*  There's a way in which the entire family has rearranged itself around the disease.
*  Some drifting away geographically, others fading away cognitively, and
*  still others who are unscathed, desperately trying to hold it all together.
*  Last Thanksgiving, 15 members of the family gathered in the Adirondacks,
*  had a rented lodge with a vaulted ceiling living room and massive stone fireplace.
*  A family compound, at least for a few days.
*  Barb and her family were there, as was Kathy,
*  the oldest sibling who doesn't carry the mutation, and her son Charlie,
*  also free of the mutation, along with his wife and son.
*  Jenny and her family were there too.
*  Barb's children had not seen her in a while.
*  Barb kept an eye on them, noticing them noticing the changes.
*  They're finally seeing what I've been dealing with for 20 years, Barb said.
*  The siblings were afflicted and the sense of responsibility that carries.
*  Susan drove eight and a half hours with Christie beside her.
*  In the lodge, most of the family played games,
*  while Christie sat in a soft easy chair by the fire, beaming at everyone.
*  I think she enjoys seeing other people in different faces,
*  Susan told me a few weeks later, just because I'm the only one that she sees
*  most of the time.
*  I believe she remembers us, said Kathy, who lives an hour or so away from Christie,
*  and is an occasional backup for Susan.
*  I believe she recognizes us.
*  This will be Susan's 27th consecutive year as Christie's full-time caregiver.
*  When Susan started, she was barely out of her 30s, single and between careers.
*  She did not expect her life to take this turn.
*  And in all this time, she has demonstrated a capacity for
*  forbearance that others in the family freely admit they lack.
*  A sort of secret reservoir of equanimity she can draw from in times of trouble.
*  Susan always saves the day in our family, Barb told me.
*  Remarkably, Susan has never been tested for the mutation.
*  She too put off the decision for years, until finally at 67,
*  she assumes she simply does not have it.
*  Instead, she remains focused on caring for her sister.
*  Every morning, Susan rises early, pulls the laundry out of the dryer,
*  tees up all the meals for the day, and makes herself some coffee before waking Christie.
*  When Susan coaxes her to the toilet and then to the shower,
*  things go more smoothly when they sing.
*  The morning I visited, it was Do You Want to Know a Secret by the Beatles.
*  She knows the words, Susan said, though the most Christie offered up during my visit was
*  a high, boisterous humming noise on pitch.
*  While Barb closely follows the progress of scientific research into FTD,
*  Susan is the emotional glue of the family now, staying close not just with siblings,
*  but with nieces and nephews who are willing to help when they can.
*  Over dinner, Susan reflected on her time with Christie, but only in fits and starts.
*  I'm not a saint, she told me.
*  This is devastating.
*  When the talk shifted to Christie's doctors, the conversation slowed down.
*  There was something they weren't saying.
*  Finally, Susan came out with it.
*  Christie has breast cancer, she said, just like their mother.
*  That started about a year and a half ago.
*  There was a sore on her breast, and I just decided, you know, we're going to let it go.
*  Susan was grave when she discussed what that means,
*  how wrangling Christie into a cancer treatment regimen seems too much to ask of her.
*  So they'll continue together for as long as it takes.
*  They had understood for a while that the genetic mutation that took over Christie's life
*  may not be what would take that life away.
*  Now, after all this time, they know how her story will end.
