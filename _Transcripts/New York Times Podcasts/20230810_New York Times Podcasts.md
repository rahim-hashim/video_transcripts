*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverny-Sea and this is The Daily.
*  This summer, an unrelenting heat wave has taken a devastating toll and has put this year
*  on track to be the hottest ever recorded.
*  Today, my colleagues Coral Devin Port and Dana Smith, on what it means to live in this
*  New Normal, where extreme heat now threatens our way of life and even our very lives.
*  It's Thursday, August 10.
*  Coral, welcome back to the show.
*  I am so happy to be back with you guys.
*  So, Coral, you cover climate change and climate policy for the times and of course this summer
*  there's been this intense heat wave going on for weeks and weeks, soaring, ER visits,
*  even some deaths.
*  You set out to understand something kind of different about the extreme heat.
*  It's economic cost.
*  Tell me about that.
*  So, yeah, I'm kind of obsessed with being able to put price tags on the cost of climate
*  change to the economy, to people's pocketbooks.
*  What is the effect of heat on how much work gets done in the United States?
*  On worker productivity, on how much work is lost, on how much pay is lost, I sort of feel
*  like I'm a climate economic detective.
*  And Coral, why were you obsessed by this question?
*  Well, I think that a lot of people when they hear about climate change, it's just this
*  giant existential threat.
*  And it's sort of hard to wrap your head around and it's sort of hard to wrap your head
*  around what to do about it.
*  But when it's explained in terms of something that absolutely everyone understands, which
*  is dollars and cents, and a specific cost, if you are an employer and you understand that
*  extreme heat caused by climate change is actually costing you worker hours or increasing
*  the amount of workers comp that you have to pay or if you are a worker and you understand
*  that it's lowering your payroll or that you just can't do your job as well.
*  In so many ways, I think this makes it very tangible and specific.
*  Anything you can put a price tag on, I think Americans understand more clearly.
*  Okay, so you went out to do this economic detective work with effects of climate change.
*  What did you find?
*  So first, Sabrina, I'm going to tell you what I thought I would find.
*  Which is something that I think a lot of readers of New York Times and listeners to the
*  daily would expect, which is like, of course, when it's hot, people work less, but the
*  workers who are affected are outdoor workers.
*  I mean, that's obvious, right?
*  Right.
*  Mailman, construction workers, farm workers.
*  Right.
*  Yes.
*  And medical researchers have known for years that when people or workers are exposed to
*  heat, they make more mistakes.
*  They think less clearly.
*  They work more slowly.
*  They have more injuries.
*  So I really thought this was going to be a story focused on outdoor workers.
*  And that was my original pitch, showing like construction workers are working less than
*  they're having more job injuries.
*  And what I found is that there's a lot of new economic data showing that heat does hurt
*  outdoor workers.
*  It's lowering outdoor worker productivity.
*  But the bigger effect on the economy in the United States is actually on indoor workers.
*  Huh.
*  It is affecting so much more of the indoor economy than we really understood.
*  And coral, why is that?
*  It's kind of surprising, right?
*  You really do think of farm workers and construction workers.
*  In my mind, people inside really wouldn't be affected as much.
*  So why is the bigger impact with indoor workers?
*  Right.
*  So a couple of reasons.
*  One simple one is that in the United States, there are far, far, far more indoor workers.
*  So even if not as many of them are being as affected by heat, the US is not fundamentally
*  an agricultural economy.
*  We are much more in indoor.
*  We are an industrial economy.
*  So that makes sense.
*  But the number two is there's so many more indoor workers are exposed to extreme heat,
*  particularly now as we are having more extreme heat than I understood.
*  One big example that was very surprising to me, many, many, many factories in the United
*  States are not air condition.
*  Interesting.
*  And there's a couple of reasons for that.
*  A lot of factories were built 30, 40 years ago at a time when the climate was different.
*  In areas like Ohio or Michigan or parts of the country where you wouldn't necessarily
*  need air conditioning in a factory.
*  And maybe workers would have to gut it out for like a week each summer when you'd have
*  a week of hot temperatures.
*  But it wouldn't be typical to have days and days or weeks and weeks or many, many days
*  with temperatures over 85 or 90 degrees.
*  Now that that is happening inside of those factories, workers are consistently experiencing
*  days where they are regularly working in conditions over 90 and 100 degrees.
*  And I'm talking about Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Kansas, parts of the country where workers
*  are going to work, they're working indoors and they're really, really hot.
*  Wow.
*  Interesting.
*  Coral, I want to talk about the workplaces and what the actual effect has been on workers.
*  But before we get to that, can you tell me what the total effect is to the economy, like
*  in actual dollars, like what are we looking at here?
*  Sure.
*  So there's studies on this.
*  One study shows that right now in the United States as a direct result of heat, the US is
*  losing about two and a half billion hours of work per year.
*  That translates a study found into about a hundred billion dollars of economic loss per
*  year and projects that that would go up to about 500 billion dollars a year by the middle
*  of the century.
*  Wow.
*  So there's a pretty clear price tag.
*  And I should say that the economists who work on these numbers, it's new to be putting
*  these price tags and they say, if anything, these are probably undercounts, under estimates
*  of what this price tag of loss is.
*  So 100 billion, going up to 500 billion dollars in loss, that's pretty dramatic.
*  I mean, that is a chunk of change, even in context of federal budgets and big ticket
*  items like that.
*  So let's dig into this.
*  What's causing this economic hit associated with extreme heat?
*  What's that number made up of?
*  Sure.
*  To just be really like dollars and cents, employer corporate about it, those dollar losses
*  are about specifically the loss of worker productivity.
*  That means that humans don't function well in heat.
*  When they are hot, they work more slowly, they make more mistakes, they need to take more
*  breaks.
*  And something that is new now is that researchers have been able to quantify how much less
*  they work when they're exposed to certain amounts of heat.
*  So there's a new study that shows when workers are working in 90 degree heat, their productivity
*  drops 25%.
*  25%.
*  And when they are exposed to heat of over 100 degrees, their productivity drops 70%.
*  Wow.
*  So you're only really working at like 30% capacity when it's 100 degrees?
*  Yes, exactly.
*  I mean, it's kind of amazing that they're actually able to put a price tag on it.
*  What are some examples of what we mean when we talk about productivity going down, like
*  from the lives of workers?
*  Sure.
*  I talked to a lot of workers for the story, people who work in different kinds of indoor
*  and outdoor environments.
*  And it's pretty simple, you know, the workers who are getting hot, they're getting exhausted
*  or sick.
*  So they need more breaks, they need more time off.
*  In some cases, when the heat is too much, the work just doesn't get done at all, it gets
*  postponed.
*  When they get dizzy or can't think clearly, they're more accidents.
*  They're more mistakes.
*  And so there's less work getting done, less hours being completed, more breaks, more
*  time off, and more mistakes.
*  And I talked to factory managers, I talked to people who work in warehouses who say,
*  in some cases, we just need to let people leave work early.
*  Or, you know, we can tell if people have heat exhaustion that they should not come back
*  to work for a day or two.
*  All of that is what responsible employers should be doing.
*  It also means that less work gets done.
*  Right.
*  Like we're not meant to work in that kind of heat, right?
*  Exactly.
*  And the thing is too, I mean, the effects go beyond productivity, go beyond lost working
*  hours.
*  I talked to workers in a meat packing plant in Kansas who talked about how this is a part
*  of the country that's experiencing so much more heat than usual, the workers inside
*  this plant are getting exposed to so much more heat.
*  And they describe goggles fogging up, not being able to see clearly.
*  And when that consistently happens, a lot of these workers said, you know, there's a huge
*  risk for food contamination, for meat contamination.
*  When we're so hot and we can't even see to do our jobs, you know, one of the workers specifically
*  described, we're working with carcasses and manure, flex of manure could get in the meat
*  if you can't see what you're doing and you're so hot, you can't think straight.
*  Something else I heard from a lot of factories, a lot of plants is much higher turnover, much
*  higher percentages of people leaving.
*  And fewer people wanting to take the jobs where they would be exposed to heat.
*  Interesting.
*  So given the cost in terms of productivity, which I assume, you know, companies understand
*  and are kind of trying to think about not to mention, of course, basic human decency,
*  having AC when it's 100 degrees, why have employers been allowing their facilities to get
*  so hot?
*  So again, one of the sort of big eye opening moments for me in reporting the story was
*  specifically discovering how many factories and sort of indoor industrial facilities in
*  the United States are not air conditioned.
*  Again, in part, because many of them are decades old, built in places and at times where we
*  did not consistently experience so much extreme heat.
*  So it wasn't necessary.
*  And then now it is wildly expensive to install cooling units in gigantic industrial facilities.
*  I'm talking hundreds of millions of dollars.
*  And so for this story, we did talk to a school bus manufacturing plant in Tulsa.
*  And this is a place that makes most of the yellow school buses.
*  We see the US where the workers were consistently working at over 90 degrees.
*  And they decided to go ahead and install a hundred million dollar cooling system.
*  But that's a really hard check to rate, I think, for a lot of companies, especially if
*  you're not sort of a gigantic national company.
*  Right.
*  Like if you're a tiny mom and pop business, the expense might just be too much to bear.
*  Exactly.
*  And so I think this is genuinely a set of costs that employers have to look at are looking
*  at across the country.
*  They're saying, you know, on one side, we're losing worker productivity.
*  We're losing worker hours.
*  I'm paying more workers' comp.
*  We're having to close on super hot days.
*  All of that is like a really clear loss on one side of the ledger.
*  On the other side is, well, you know, do I invest a hundred million dollars on indoor cooling
*  or do I just take the hit in productivity?
*  But can employers just do that?
*  Like ignore what he is doing to their workers?
*  Like aren't there rules about that?
*  In most of the country, there are no rules about that.
*  Again, speaking to the point that this is really a new experience for workers, for employers,
*  for the economy, this level of exposure to heat.
*  So right now, you know, OSHA, which is the federal agency that regulates workplace safety
*  and has many, many rules in place for time limits on work and for safety and for exposure
*  to all kinds of hazardous conditions, OSHA right now, there's no federal regulation
*  that protects workers from exposure to heat or compels employers to protect their workers
*  from heat exposure.
*  There are seven states currently that have some kind of state level regulation, but nothing
*  in place at the national level.
*  Right.
*  Are authorities trying to make some?
*  I mean, given our new heat reality?
*  Yes.
*  So the Biden administration has directed OSHA to begin the process of crafting new federal
*  regulations on heat and worker exposure.
*  This is very new this process.
*  It could take as long as 10 years.
*  This is another thing I was surprised to learn when I did this reporting is just how long
*  it can actually take to write national workplace safety regulations.
*  The expectation is, you know, what OSHA is working on is expected to set some kind of
*  heat standards, you know, workers who are working over a certain temperature or exposed
*  to certain temperatures for a certain amount of time must be given breaks, must be given
*  water, indoor workplaces where workers are exposed to heat may need to install air conditioning.
*  That's sort of the expected standard that we're likely to see from this, but that could be
*  years away.
*  And in the meantime, there are a lot of business groups that are coming out and saying, hey,
*  we don't want to see this.
*  This could be too expensive.
*  We can figure this out ourselves.
*  This is burdensome government regulation.
*  Right.
*  I mean, given our new heat reality, presumably something has to change.
*  Well, I mean, it's changing already, right?
*  Workers are already suffering.
*  We're already taking the economic hit.
*  Someone who I interviewed in reporting this story was a former senior official, Ed Oshat,
*  who said, this is going to cost a lot no matter what.
*  Either employers are going to have to incorporate these new costs, you know, installing cool and
*  giving a lot more breaks, all the other costs that they will have to pay to protect their
*  workers in the new world of heat.
*  And it's going to cost them a lot.
*  And if they don't pay it, then we're going to see workers die.
*  Coral, thank you.
*  It was great to be with you, Sabrina.
*  After the break, what extreme heat actually does to the body?
*  We're right back.
*  There is no end in sight to a dangerous heat wave around 100 million Americans
*  under excessive heat alerts this morning.
*  Global Paso, Texas temperatures have hit 100 for 43 straight days, while Phoenix, Arizona
*  has seen a scorching 110 degrees for nearly 30 days in a row.
*  Heat may have led to the death of a local man in Death Valley, the 71 year old from Los
*  Angeles collapsed outside a restroom yesterday when the temperature was 121 degrees.
*  And we've learned a letter carrier died Tuesday while walking his route in Dallas.
*  Texas inmates are dying in sweltering prisons.
*  At least nine inmates have died since the relentless heat wave has gripped Texas.
*  As of July 11th, 12 people have died due to heat, with 55 additional numbers released
*  by Maricopa County reveals so far this year, 25 people have died from our relentless heat.
*  Now tracking 39 heat related death this summer with more than 300 cases still waiting on
*  confirmation.
*  The medical examiner is telling Arizona's family we are on track to have a record summer
*  for deadly heat.
*  Dana, welcome to the show.
*  Thanks so much for having me.
*  So Dana, we just heard from our colleague, Coral Davinport about the economic effects
*  of heat.
*  And of course that has everything to do with how heat affects people and their bodies.
*  And I think everybody has a kind of basic understanding that heat can be bad, but I don't
*  think people really understand how, like the science of it, like what actually happens
*  to our bodies in extreme heat.
*  So tell me about that.
*  Yeah, I think a lot of people think of heat as an annoyance.
*  I grew up in North Carolina where it is famously hot and humid in the summers.
*  And it's kind of a pain, but you don't think that it's deadly, but I think what is a real
*  surprise for people is that heat is actually the number one cause of death when it comes
*  to extreme weather events.
*  So it really is a very serious thing that we have to account for, especially now with
*  a warming planet.
*  The number one cause of weather-related death, like more than hurricanes or floods.
*  Yes, that's right.
*  It is the number one cause of death due to weather-related events, is heat.
*  Well, that's kind of amazing.
*  So let's unpack it.
*  What actually happens to people's bodies when they're exposed to extreme heat?
*  So the body has two main ways to cool itself down.
*  I think the first one we're all familiar with, which is sweat.
*  So our sweat glands on our skin start to produce sweat.
*  And the goal is that that sweat evaporates off the body.
*  And when it does, it cools the area underneath.
*  Okay.
*  That's your right, pretty known.
*  So what's the other one?
*  So the really cool part is the second aspect of the body's cooling mechanism, which is
*  that it starts to increase blood flow.
*  So when it does that, the body is pushing more blood that normally circulates around
*  your internal organs.
*  And now it's redirecting that blood out to the surface of the skin.
*  And that helps partly because the body can actually dissipate heat out through the skin,
*  so it just releases heat into the atmosphere.
*  But the really crazy part is that when the sweat evaporates off your skin and cools the
*  area underneath, it's actually also cooling that blood that is now closer to the surface.
*  And that cooler blood can recirculate back to your internal organs and cool them down.
*  Got it.
*  Okay.
*  So organs get hot.
*  Blood takes the heat away from those organs to the surface of your skin.
*  It has contact with the air, which is cooler, and cools you down.
*  Exactly.
*  So there's a really cool kind of two-step process with that sweat evaporation, then cooling
*  the blood underneath the skin, and then hopefully cooling down the internal organs as it
*  recirculates back through the body.
*  Got it.
*  Okay.
*  So enter extreme heat.
*  So what happens when it gets hotter outside?
*  So these two processes work really well in most conditions, but they do start to fail
*  when it gets too hot or too humid.
*  So you have to think of your body and the environment kind of on a gradient in terms of temperature
*  and moisture.
*  So when your skin temperature, which is normally about 95 degrees Fahrenheit, is hotter than
*  the air outside, your skin can actually release heat out into the environment.
*  But when the air temperature is hotter than your skin, your skin starts to gain heat
*  from the environment, and you can no longer cool down that way through the increased blood
*  flow.
*  Okay.
*  So that happens with humidity.
*  If it's too humid outside, if there's too much moisture in the air, the water on your
*  skin, the sweat on your skin can't evaporate.
*  And so it just sits there or pulls off.
*  So again, that cooling mechanism is lost.
*  Got it.
*  So it's all about this gradient, basically.
*  All of these processes in your body are interacting with the atmosphere around your body, what's
*  going on in the air?
*  And if it's too humid, can't sweat.
*  If it's too hot, your body is going to take in heat as opposed to give it off.
*  So that's a problem for the body.
*  Exactly.
*  So what exactly happens like inside your body when it gets too hot and humid?
*  Right.
*  So because of that increased circulation, the heart is really the most important organ
*  when it comes to cooling down your body.
*  So the heart is having to pump harder and faster.
*  So your heart rate increases because it's trying to push blood further out, so out to
*  the very surface of your skin.
*  So it's working a lot harder.
*  Right.
*  But at the same time, blood pressure can start to drop because there's not really an increased
*  amount of blood volume.
*  You're just pushing the same amount of blood to a wider surface area.
*  So the heart is working harder, but your blood pressure is dropping because that blood is
*  trying to get all over the body instead of just in one area around the organs.
*  Therefore, the pressure is weaker and weaker the further out it gets.
*  That's exactly right.
*  Yes.
*  And a drop in blood pressure is actually one of the most common causes of injury because
*  someone might stand up with they've been sitting and they don't have enough blood going
*  up to their head and then they can feel dizzy or faint.
*  So these are often really early signs that someone is really struggling from the heat
*  is low blood pressure, dizziness, and potentially even fainting.
*  Okay.
*  So your body's working extra hard to increase your circulation and this is taxing your
*  heart.
*  Exactly.
*  And in older people or people who have a preexisting condition, especially one related
*  to the heart, this can actually turn fatal.
*  This is how he can kill them in the end is by really taxing their heart.
*  But in young healthy people, this isn't as much of a problem.
*  The heart is pretty resilient.
*  The body is pretty resilient and eventually the increase in core temperature will plateau.
*  But if the temperatures are really extreme, 100 degrees and more, if someone is working
*  out or working in the heat, then problems can start to arise.
*  You can still continue to heat up.
*  So heat exhaustion or heat stress is one of the first really serious problems that can
*  arise and scientists think that that's generally when the internal temperature of the body reaches
*  about 100 to 103 degrees.
*  And what exactly is heat exhaustion, Dana?
*  I hear it a lot and feel like myself, I have experienced it, but what's going on scientifically
*  in the body?
*  Yeah.
*  So it's a real general sense of fatigue.
*  Also your muscles might start not to function very well.
*  And scientists think that this is actually a protective signal from the brain.
*  So your brain is actually telling your body to stop working, to sit down, to get somewhere
*  shaded and cool so that it can try to cool itself off.
*  Interesting.
*  So it makes you tired so that you do that.
*  Exactly.
*  That is a really protective mechanism to try to prevent the next stage in the process,
*  which is heat stroke, which can be deadly.
*  Okay.
*  So tell me about heat stroke.
*  What is that?
*  So normally the body is really good at trying to prevent your body from heating up too
*  fast.
*  But if those mechanisms start to fail, so say that you're in really extreme conditions,
*  maybe you're a worker and you have on heavy work equipment so that your sweat can't evaporate
*  out into the environment, or if you're working hard or exercising and you're generating
*  internal heat as well as gaining it from the outside, then your internal temperature
*  can continue to rise even past the point of heat exhaustion.
*  And that's when things get really dangerous.
*  And what happens then?
*  So scientists think about 104 degrees is generally the cut off for heat stroke.
*  And at that point, you can start to have multi-organ failure.
*  Okay, multi-organ failure.
*  So which organs are we talking about?
*  So the organs that are most immediately and dangerously affected are the heart, which
*  we've talked about a little bit, and then also the kidneys, the gut, and the brain.
*  Okay.
*  So heart kidneys, gut, brain.
*  So start with the heart.
*  So I talked about this a little bit, but the heart is pumping harder and harder and harder.
*  So your heart rate is increasing, your blood pressure is dropping.
*  And what happens when your blood pressure drops is that blood can't circulate to everywhere
*  that it needs to go.
*  And so your organs slowly start to become deprived of oxygen.
*  And that includes your heart.
*  So it can even look like a heart attack where your heart was actually starved of oxygen
*  because it just wasn't able to pump enough blood to the organs, including to itself.
*  Okay.
*  So that's the heart.
*  What about the kidneys?
*  The kidneys is really interesting because the brain actually sends a signal to the body
*  that it should stop sending as much blood to the kidneys as it starts to get dehydrated.
*  So a quick refresher, your kidneys are what are cleaning your blood and then the waste
*  gets excreted as urine.
*  But that means that you're going to be losing a little bit of liquid.
*  So if you're dehydrated, your body wants to preserve as much liquid as it possibly can.
*  And so blood stops being pushed as much to the kidneys so that you don't lose it any
*  as urine.
*  But as a result, your kidneys are then also starved of oxygen and those cells can start
*  to suffer and die.
*  It's interesting, got it.
*  So body is just trying to preserve liquid any way it can.
*  But the effect of that is that oxygen stops flowing to the kidneys.
*  Exactly.
*  And your kidneys can survive for a little bit of time with reduced blood flow and reduced
*  oxygen.
*  But if that gets prolonged, you can start to have kidney failure.
*  Okay.
*  And you said also Dana the gut.
*  So how is my gut affected?
*  The gut is another area that blood is diverted from pretty quickly.
*  And as a result, also has less oxygen going there.
*  And when that happens, the gut can start to fail and break down a little bit and you
*  can start to have what we know as leaky gut.
*  So the bacteria that's in your gut can actually start to travel out into the bloodstream, causing
*  inflammation and in really extreme and long-term situations, sepsis.
*  Sepsis from heat.
*  That's kind of crazy.
*  Exactly.
*  The emergency room physicians I spoke with said that sepsis is not a common cause of death
*  when it comes to heat, normally because your other organs fail faster, frankly, but it
*  is something that can occur.
*  Okay.
*  So your heart is working over time.
*  Kidneys aren't getting enough oxygen.
*  Gut is leaking.
*  So full on multi-organ failure, is your saying?
*  Yes.
*  And not only the heart, the kidneys and the gut, but also your brain.
*  And when the brain is affected, things are getting really bad.
*  So heat stroke by definition means that the brain is being affected.
*  You know, you think stroke, you think brain.
*  And so the reduced blood flow, the lack of oxygen, the increased temperature are affecting
*  your brain just like every other organ.
*  So what is really kind of perverse about heat stroke is that the body's internal thermometer
*  is located in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus.
*  And if that starts to dysfunction or malfunction, then your body can actually stop cooling itself
*  down.
*  So oftentimes when people have really extreme heat stroke, they stop sweating.
*  Their skin might feel cool and clammy.
*  You know, they are no longer trying to cool their body down, even though their internal
*  temperature is continuing to rise.
*  So basically, kind of like the instinct to sweat and to have the body deal with this natural
*  emergency state has gone.
*  It's the brain is off-kilter.
*  Exactly.
*  It started to fail.
*  So people also start to have dizziness, confusion, delirium.
*  You're just no longer responding to your external environment and that can really be deadly.
*  So what's the fastest way to cool somebody off and save somebody if they get into this
*  dangerous situation?
*  It's an ice bath.
*  It sounds really simple, but it actually is the fastest way to cool down your internal
*  temperature and try to prevent organ failure.
*  So this is even what they use in emergency rooms is kind of a glorified ice bath and you
*  can also do this in your home.
*  But is that not too drastic a temperature contrast?
*  I asked an exercise physiologist about this because I thought the same, but he said that there's
*  been a fair amount of research on this and there's a greater risk of heat than there is
*  of a kind of temperature change shock to your body.
*  So really the most important thing you can do is to cool someone down as fast as possible
*  and an ice bath is the way.
*  Okay, so ice bath got it.
*  I will remember that.
*  Now Dana, you mentioned earlier that people with heart conditions can be particularly susceptible
*  to the dangers of extreme heat, which you just laid out in pretty frightening terms.
*  I'm wondering are there other people or groups who are really vulnerable?
*  I think this is really fascinating.
*  An earlier article I wrote during the summer heat waves looked at how elderly people are
*  really uniquely vulnerable to heat.
*  And that's because both of our two cooling mechanisms, the sweating and increased blood
*  flow are hampered in a lot of older adults.
*  So older adults just don't sweat very much.
*  You know, their sweat glands produce less sweat than they used to.
*  And so that really important way to cool yourself down is just really not as available to
*  you.
*  And then a lot of older adults, partly just because of age and partly because of preexisting
*  conditions, have decreased blood flow.
*  So again, the heart is just not as able to push as much blood to the surface of the skin
*  as happens in younger adults.
*  Now the good news is that older adults who are physically fit, they do still maintain
*  these cooling mechanisms better than unfit older adults.
*  So exercise is almost always the most important thing you can do for yourself health wise.
*  And it's the same when it comes to extreme heat.
*  Dana, I think one of the things we're actually realizing is that this extreme heat is here
*  to stay, right?
*  This is our new climate reality and we'll have plenty more summers like this.
*  So in many ways, this is our new normal.
*  So I guess I'm wondering, is there any way to adapt to this?
*  There is some research that the human body can adapt to heat and that is mostly in extreme
*  athletes.
*  So athletes who are doing long endurance training in high temperatures.
*  And what scientists see is that they actually start these cooling mechanisms faster.
*  So they start to sweat at lower temperatures.
*  They have increased blood flow at lower temperatures.
*  They also are more cardiovascularly fit.
*  So their heart is just able to withstand the stress of that increased blood flow and
*  heart rate for longer.
*  Interesting.
*  I was a reporter in Baghdad in Iraq for a number of years and it was a time when I was doing
*  a lot of running and we had this strip we would run on and it was 120 degrees at 8 pm.
*  And I remember doing that run and just feeling like my body was so taxed but I got good at
*  it and then coming back to New York and running in Central Park and thinking, oh my God,
*  this is easy.
*  It was so much easier to run in a normal temperature than to run at 120 but I did get used to the
*  120.
*  Exactly.
*  The body is remarkable and it actually can adapt to these extreme temperatures but that
*  is not realistic, frankly, for most people, especially again, older adults and people with
*  preexisting conditions who are the most at risk for heat.
*  So while it is possible, it's really not the best strategy that we should just think
*  that biologically we can adapt to these extreme temperatures.
*  I think we just really have to respect the heat and take it seriously and I think that
*  we're going to have to continue to adapt our behaviors and our lifestyles going forward
*  as we deal with hotter and hotter temperatures.
*  So that means air conditioning, cooling centers, dehydration and doing those really practical
*  behavioral ways to cool yourself down in these hot climates.
*  So just being smart about heat is really essential and can be life-saving.
*  Dana, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Wednesday, fast-moving wildfires have killed six people on the island of Maui in Hawaii
*  over the past two days, as gusty winds were amplified by Hurricane Dora, hundreds of miles
*  to the south.
*  Some residents survived by swimming into the ocean, where they were rescued by the U.S. Coast
*  Guard.
*  More than 2,000 people were in evacuation shelters as of Wednesday night, as search and rescue
*  missions continued.
*  And President Biden escalated his confrontation with China by signing an executive order that
*  bans American investments in key technology industries.
*  The order will prohibit venture capital and private equity firms from pumping money
*  into Chinese efforts to develop semiconductors and other microelectronics, quantum computers
*  and certain artificial intelligence applications.
*  American officials stressed that the move was tailored to guard national security, but
*  China is likely to see it as part of a wider campaign to contain its rise.
*  Today's episode was produced by Diana Wynn, Carlos Prieto, and Summer Tomad.
*  With help from Nina Feldman and Sydney Harper, it was edited by Devon Taylor with help from
*  PageCowatt, contains original music by Alicia Vaetube, Mary and Luzano, and Rowan Nemistow,
*  and was engineered by Alyssa Moxley.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Lansfirk, up wonderfully.
