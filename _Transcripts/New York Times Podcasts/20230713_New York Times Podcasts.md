*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tevernicee, and this is the Daily.
*  Two weeks ago today, the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action, upending years of
*  admissions practices at selective colleges.
*  Since then, the Daily has been talking to Americans around the country about that decision.
*  Yeah, this admissions cycle for college was very tough on me, and there was a lot of
*  speculation that it was because of my race.
*  I've always been pro-affirmative action, but it's always maybe a little uncomfortable.
*  I'm in the same way that I think it makes most people of color who had the benefits of
*  affirmative action a little uncomfortable.
*  I guess we all expected that affirmative action would be a temporary arrangement, but
*  it looks like every time we take a few steps forward, we take three steps backwards.
*  Today, we hear from three people who explain how affirmative action changed the course of
*  their lives.
*  The complicated feelings they have about it, and what they think of a future without the
*  policy.
*  It's Thursday, July 13th.
*  Dr. Sims, what was going through your head when you first heard the news?
*  Well, I was pissed, you know.
*  I've been fighting my whole life.
*  I'm getting sick of this crap, you know, because any time it looks like we as a people are
*  getting an advantage to people just freak out.
*  They freak out.
*  You've been given everything they need.
*  I don't see why we need to give them anything else.
*  Oh, I got into discussion with the Trump supporter the other day.
*  That's off the point.
*  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm going to bring you back.
*  I'm bringing you back.
*  Bring me back.
*  Can you bring me back?
*  Bring me back.
*  Go ahead.
*  Okay.
*  Let me ask you, Dr. Sims, if you could just introduce yourself for me.
*  Tell me your name, your age, your profession, and where you live.
*  Okay.
*  Richard V. Sims, the third MD, 75 and a half years old, a meritorious professor of medicine,
*  University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, a place of residential is best
*  for the state of the state of Alabama.
*  Tell me a little bit about your background, where you grew up, what your parents did, and
*  then we can talk about your education.
*  I lived in some of that New Jersey from 1948 when I was born until 1966 when I graduated
*  from high school.
*  My father grew up in Mississippi and stuff, so he knew what the South was about, where
*  he was determined to get out of there.
*  Do you know if they were descendants of enslaved people?
*  Do you know what their backgrounds were?
*  All of them were slaves.
*  My mother's family, they were all enslaved.
*  They all made a lot of money for the people who enslaved them and they didn't ever get
*  anything for it.
*  They made a lot of wealth for the people in this country for free.
*  And so they found the North to be left of a hereristic, murderous place as the South and
*  exploited a place at the South, but they still found that there was racism even in the North.
*  And I know my father decided, he wanted to be a surgeon, and when he applied to medical
*  school, he was accepted, but when they found out he was black, they said, well, we can't
*  it take you.
*  So you know, all the other predominantly white institutions, they all rejected him, so
*  he wound up at Howard.
*  And I can tell you that my father was a family medicine practitioner, and he could not
*  admit a patient to the local hospital on his own.
*  He had to get a white attending.
*  You take care of his patients, although he was a very smart, very qualified person,
*  but they wouldn't let him admit patients.
*  And Dr. Sims, tell me a little bit about your own impulse in terms of college and education.
*  You know, you were watching your father doing his practice.
*  How did you think about your education?
*  I was driven.
*  I was driven.
*  I was in the top and people in my class when I graduated.
*  Wow.
*  Most of my courses were advanced placement, except for math.
*  So I'm sorry.
*  I don't mean to brag, but you asked me.
*  I did.
*  So then I went to Amherst, which was my number one school.
*  And remind me when you graduated from Amherst?
*  70.
*  1970.
*  That's a long time ago.
*  That's a long time ago, yes.
*  And I knew I liked people.
*  I loved science and math and so forth.
*  And my dad was my hero.
*  I said, OK, I'm going to med school.
*  So I just applied a bunch of places.
*  Some places I didn't think I had a chance to get into.
*  I wasn't one of the top students in the class.
*  I mean, I was a solid B plus student.
*  I was up in my class.
*  I graduated with Amherst, but I wasn't Harvard category.
*  I mean, I'm convinced that affirmative action got me into Harvard because they hardly
*  even talked to me before I got my acceptance.
*  How do you understand that?
*  I mean, how do you feel about that?
*  What was your kind of thinking?
*  I feel fine about it.
*  I mean, everybody who is there had some kind of, you know, it takes you use a lever to
*  move something large.
*  Everybody there had a lever, you know, where the legacies where the parents went to the
*  medical school.
*  You had people who were big donors, whose kids were coming there.
*  And that sort of thing.
*  So why should I feel badly about my little lever because I didn't have nut and
*  elf?
*  So remind me what your Harvard experience was like.
*  So you walk onto campus the first time fall of 1970.
*  Well, I got dazzled.
*  I mean, you know, a Harvard medical school.
*  Right.
*  I mean, I was like, they were stars in my eye.
*  What do you think?
*  I'm a type of man.
*  And I said, oh my gosh.
*  Do you have a memory for me, Dr. Sims, of being in med school and kind of just like?
*  I do.
*  I took a rotation in pediatrics at Austin Children's Hospital.
*  In the whole time I was there, I was, as was my way, I would ask the supervising residents
*  in the attendees about how am I doing?
*  Is there any way I can improve my presentations?
*  Is there anything I need to know in terms of feedback?
*  And they said, oh, no, you're doing fine.
*  You're doing fine.
*  And I wound up with a deep in the course.
*  It told me that they didn't expect anything better.
*  And I was in the top half of my class.
*  I wasn't near, you know, the top 10 or nothing like that because there were some really,
*  really outstanding bright students there.
*  There were also, you know, some of those legacies.
*  There were nothing impressive at all.
*  People had low expectations for you, you know, would sometimes say things that would indicate
*  that they didn't think you belonged there and that it was unlikely you were going to be
*  successful.
*  And you were taking the place that somebody else should have had.
*  And I mean, there's no question the name on my CV has opened doors.
*  It is an open doors for me that ordinarily I think would not have opened.
*  But that just made for a terrible experience.
*  I didn't even go to my graduation.
*  I was just so angry.
*  I just said, I'm not going to graduation.
*  That's the thing.
*  I'm getting out of here.
*  But that was probably short-sighted on my part.
*  I mean, I should have done it for my parents, you know, so that they could see that their
*  sonny boy had actually got through the place.
*  Hi Professor Harper.
*  Hi, how are you?
*  Tyler's fine, but thank you.
*  I'm very good.
*  I'm very good.
*  Nice to meet you.
*  Nice to meet you too.
*  So why don't you do me a favor and just ID yourself for me?
*  Tell me your name, your age, where you live and what you do for a living.
*  Sure.
*  My name is Tyler Austin Harper.
*  I'm 31 years old.
*  I live in Scarborough, Maine, and I teach environmental studies at Bates College.
*  So let's talk a little bit about your background, Tyler, and where you grew up.
*  Tell me about your family and your parents.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  So I was born and raised in Mechanics for Pennsylvania.
*  For better or worse, Central Pennsylvania is a pretty rural place.
*  Right.
*  So, you know, I grew up really close to the abolition trail.
*  It was a great and quiet place to be a kid.
*  Particularly when I was growing up, it was a very colorblind place, you know, being a
*  good person.
*  In that area, I meant not talking about race, not asking people about their race, and
*  pretending it doesn't exist politely.
*  And so I'll be honest with you, I was pretty naive about race.
*  It was not something I ever spent much time thinking about, which I think surprises people
*  because I grew up as a brown person in a very, very white part of the country.
*  My biological father, who is black, split when I was pretty young, so I was raised by a
*  single mother, and toys about 10.
*  My mother remarried to my adoptive father, who's a wonderful man.
*  And just because we're about to be talking about affirmative action, Tyler, your mom is
*  she white?
*  She is.
*  My mother had a year or two of college, but had me very young and finishing a four-year
*  degree was not in the cards.
*  And I think she really wanted me to do what she hadn't been able to complete, which was
*  a four-year college degree.
*  So she was always really clear, how high water I'd be going to college.
*  You'd be going to college.
*  I was a curious student, I would say, not always the most motivated, I'll be honest.
*  I spent a lot of time fishing and playing guitar, but I did okay in terms of grades.
*  Like most high school students, I was required by the school to take the PSATs, the precursor
*  to the SATs, and was very shocked to find when I got my results back that I had done
*  really well.
*  And at that point, the guidance counselor and some other folks were telling me that I
*  should think about a different caliber of institution than I think I previously had
*  in mind.
*  So I applied a early decision to have referred and that was sort of all she wrote.
*  So at the time that you applied to college, how did you identify yourself in terms of your
*  race at that point?
*  I don't recall how I specifically checked boxes on my have referred application form.
*  When available, I generally have checked black and white if you can check both.
*  A lot of times you can actually only check one.
*  In those cases, I've always since I was young, just checked the black box.
*  So you said you had excellent scores going into college, but was there an element of race
*  as well?
*  Was affirmative action also a play there?
*  Do you have any sense of that?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah, I remember really clearly my have referred interview where the interviewer has asked
*  me about my hobbies and I mentioned I used to do competitive fast fishing tournaments
*  really seriously.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  Wow.
*  And so I was actually to my knowledge, the youngest person to go to the state championship
*  but I was 16.
*  And she thought that was delightful, but she said a number of things along the lines of
*  that's very curious hobby for someone of your background.
*  I don't really know what she meant by my background because I'm from an area where a lot of people
*  fit.
*  So I thought I had the exact background for someone who would do this kind of thing.
*  And I gradually came to realize she meant my racial background.
*  A black fisherman was not something they ran into a lot.
*  And she really fixated on that, asked me a ton of questions about it.
*  And I think it was one of the reasons they were interested in me.
*  She thought I had a curious background, kept saying.
*  Based on the tone of my conversation with the admissions officer, it was very clear
*  to me that they were very excited to be talking to a person of color, especially a person
*  of color that had scores they were excited about.
*  Well, how do that make you feel?
*  What did you think about that?
*  I've always had mixed feelings about affirmative action.
*  Very grateful for it.
*  I think it's important.
*  I think it's necessary.
*  But it's also just uncomfortable to realize you are somewhere, whether you deserve to be
*  there or not, because of the color of your skin.
*  As I left HaveReford and went on to my PhD program, I began tutoring the first summer
*  after grad school as a way to make extra money during the summers.
*  And it was really once I started tutoring that I became fully aware of the extent to which
*  affirmative action seemed to have gone off the rails and really problematic and quite disturbing
*  directions.
*  You know, I was somebody getting a literature PhD.
*  My bread and butter was helping them with their writing and their college essay in particular.
*  And I came to realize very swiftly that this intense concern about leveraging, minimizing
*  or maximizing one's identity in ways that would be legible and beneficial in the admissions
*  process was something most of these students seemed to have in mind.
*  Do you remember Tyler the first time you started encountering this?
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  The first student I encountered who had this mindset was a Chinese American student who
*  I tutored in Queens.
*  And I arrived and she has all her materials.
*  And she wanted me to look through them and she asked me to read them to make sure they
*  didn't seem to Asian.
*  And I laughed because I thought she was being ironic.
*  And she was like, no, I'm serious.
*  And she pulled out her CV and was like, I've been wondering, can I keep chess and math
*  club on here or do those seem to Asian?
*  Like are those two stereotypical?
*  And so we ended up having like a 20 minute conversation about whether or not chess and
*  math club are two stereotypically Asian to put on her CV or if it would actually be better
*  for her just not to mention that she had done those.
*  I thought it was kind of odd, very sad, a little strange and slightly amusing.
*  I thought this would be a one-off kind of thing.
*  But these kinds of conversations were basically the norm throughout my tutoring.
*  These were not cynically conspiring students that desperately were just trying to rig the
*  system.
*  It was very clear to me that they felt this is what was expected of them.
*  This is what was wanted from them.
*  They were just trying to do it as best they could.
*  So the Supreme Court hands down the ruling that overturns affirmative action.
*  What do you think?
*  What was the first thing that came to your mind?
*  I think what I thought is that things are just going to get worse.
*  And I think there's going to be some efforts to figure out ways to maintain the current
*  level of diversity in ways that are compliant with a law.
*  I think some institutions will do this.
*  I think I work at an institution that will do this.
*  But I think a lot of the negative externalities of affirmative action are going to get worse.
*  And get worse how, Tyler, tell me about that.
*  I think it leads to an atmosphere in which race and value are deeply intertwined in these
*  students' consciousness as they're entering these institutions.
*  And I don't know that that leaves once they're there.
*  And why does the decision, though, make that more the case?
*  Sure.
*  Because colleges are still going to want to diversify.
*  And the options they're going to have for identifying diverse students is going to be through
*  the prism of the college essay.
*  There are not going to be some of the other mechanisms available to identify students
*  of color.
*  And so students of color are going to be forced to or feel compelled to lean more caricatured
*  surely into their racial identity, right?
*  And to present versions of their racial identity that will be the most legible to emissions
*  officers.
*  Other students might find creative ways to be racially ambiguous, right?
*  Make it a little harder for colleges to read.
*  You know, what someone's racial identity might be?
*  I mean, that's my prediction.
*  Yeah.
*  I think we're going to be left with all of the negative externalities of affirmative action
*  without the benefits of actual structural redress and opportunity that accompany you to
*  the system that was admittedly imperfect but better than the alternative.
*  So, when the Supreme Court decision came out, I was like a lot of Asian Americans celebrating.
*  My family was actually very happy to just saying, oh, this is good for us.
*  Like, this is kind of like a win for the community.
*  And I kind of felt that initially too.
*  And was that in part because of your college admissions process?
*  Yes, yes.
*  So, my name is Gia Shen.
*  I'm currently 18 years old.
*  I'm recently just graduated from Tanaflai High School.
*  So that's in Tanaflai New Jersey.
*  And I will be attending Boston University to study journalism in the fall.
*  My parents are immigrants.
*  They immigrated from South Korea when they were in their late 20s.
*  It took a long time and a lot of hard work for them to get to where they are today.
*  Right now, my mom is an accountant and my dad works as a bank examiner.
*  I grew up in a pretty affluent town with a lot of resources.
*  My parents had done everything to provide me with the best opportunities possible.
*  The reason why we live in the area that we do with a good public school education is because
*  they want me to get the best education possible.
*  That was at the forefront of our family values and what we wanted most for us.
*  And when you were growing up, did your parents talk to you about what your goals should be
*  in terms of education, what their expectations were of you?
*  So a lot of expectations were placed upon me at an early age to be a gifted child, to study
*  hard and definitely to attend an elite college.
*  And that was always the priority.
*  My mom used state school as a threat.
*  She'd say, like, you're either going to an IV or Rutgers.
*  There's no in between.
*  I'm not paying free tuition if you don't get into an IV.
*  Wow.
*  GPA was always first.
*  That was just the kind of pressure I grew up under.
*  And it made me feel like my self-worth was tied to a school or tied to my results.
*  And that's completely not the case.
*  What do you think was behind your mom emphasizing elite schools in particular, you know, IV league
*  schools?
*  What was she trying to say there?
*  I think she was saying this is coming out from her own lived experiences and insecurities
*  and the hardship that she's been through.
*  She honestly, like, works harder than anyone else.
*  I know she can't go out because she's working.
*  And if she's not working, she's taking care of me or my brother or she's giving rise
*  or she's cooking.
*  So she never really had a life outside of her work and her family.
*  And she thought that me having an elite education at an elite institution meant that it would
*  unlock a lot more opportunities.
*  And in the end, it comes down to money.
*  She didn't want me to be tied down to just working, working, working.
*  Just like she did, but rather she wanted me to have financial freedom.
*  She wanted me to have the freedom to pursue what I'm passionate about.
*  And at the end of the day, I think that's a very noble dream.
*  It's very selfless.
*  But that's kind of why she pushed me so hard to achieve success at an Ivy League institution.
*  So tell me about your high school experience.
*  What was it like at high school?
*  Okay.
*  So, yeah, throughout high school, I was very ambitious as a student.
*  I was very dedicated and committed to extracurriculars.
*  What's an example to tell me what you did?
*  Okay.
*  So, for two years, I worked as a co-editor and chief for my newspaper and my school's
*  literary magazine.
*  I self-published a book talking about the different challenges that we as Gen Z face
*  created a nonprofit organization for youth mental health.
*  I did varsity cheer and martial arts.
*  I also played the violin and playing for 12 years now.
*  I was a concertmaster of my school's orchestra.
*  I had a 4.56 GPA.
*  And after my junior year, I attended a creative writing summer program at University of Pennsylvania.
*  I loved just all the instructors and the assignments connected so well with the people, loved the
*  culture.
*  For me, you pen felt like somewhere that I could call home.
*  So I applied early decision there.
*  And the day before my decision came out, people around me were saying, like, oh, you are
*  going to get, like, they were already making their Instagram stories posts to, like, say,
*  like, yeah, you got it.
*  My friends were like, they have Cape prepared.
*  They had all these things prepared.
*  But they said, if you don't get in, who is going to, like, who's going to get in?
*  So it was kind of like a no brainer that I would go to, not even just an IV, but at least
*  a top 20 in a league institution.
*  Overall that day, I was like so nervous I couldn't eat.
*  I could barely sleep at night too.
*  And when it was time for me to open my decision, my family was behind me looking at my laptop.
*  They were all excited to check.
*  And then it was 7pm when decisions were supposed to come out.
*  I still remember it was 7.02 when it came out because I had to wait two whole minutes,
*  which felt like forever.
*  But when I opened my letter, it said, like, sorry, we were going to inform you, thought
*  that thought.
*  And that was not even a possibility in my mind, actually.
*  I think that was probably the biggest shock of my life.
*  I mean, I've only lived 18 years, but it was still a really, like, huge shock for me
*  and my family, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  But I got rejected, not even deferred.
*  And what happened?
*  What did you do?
*  Well, after that, I was just still in shock.
*  I wasn't really feeling anything.
*  I was really numb.
*  But I was also so upset that I didn't even know how to react.
*  I decided to just stay up all night working on my other applications for my other schools.
*  And I added a bunch more to my college list because I was scared that if this is how it's
*  going to play out, then I better try out everything possible and give my all to all of these
*  schools instead of attaching my dream to one school.
*  Right.
*  So I applied to 19 schools in total.
*  And it was just one rejection after another, even the schools that I was confident I would
*  get into.
*  They were just nose.
*  And by the end of it, I ended up only getting into two, one of which was my state school
*  Rutgers.
*  The other one was Boston University.
*  And I realized that these two options are my options.
*  And I should be grateful for them.
*  But I had never expected anything like this to be my reality.
*  And no one had an explanation for why.
*  Like we couldn't attribute it to anything.
*  I just felt really horrible about myself.
*  I felt like I couldn't really show my face nearly in public.
*  I felt ashamed.
*  I was having this big stick curve on my head.
*  So like loser, I didn't make it.
*  But my mom also said that she couldn't meet with her friends.
*  She felt embarrassed too.
*  And I totally understood because in my community, there's also a culture of a lot of gossip
*  and seeing if your kids didn't turn out this way, then means you didn't really succeed
*  as maybe a parent or something went wrong, like what went wrong there.
*  In the days and weeks after you got your admissions decisions, what were your family members
*  and friends and community members saying to you?
*  One thing that stood out to me was, people said you just got affirmative action.
*  Like as a verb.
*  Oh wow.
*  What did that mean?
*  You just got affirmative action.
*  It was people telling me that I was disadvantaged because of affirmative action in my race.
*  It was people talking about the race box and how big of a deal it was.
*  That's what people have said either as a joke or a passing comment.
*  So just thinking about all of this was kind of what informed my beliefs about affirmative
*  action at the time.
*  Gia, what was going through your mind when you heard that the Supreme Court had overturned
*  affirmative action?
*  It was actually a lot of conflicting emotions initially.
*  Part of me was like very happy that this would be the future.
*  Part of me was feeling bitter because I felt like I was wrong in some senses or screwed
*  over as a lot of people were buzzing around me saying if you just applied a year later,
*  you'd end up at an early institution.
*  But also I want to say that my view changed since then.
*  Tell me about that.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, a lot of Asian Americans wanted affirmative action to be overturned.
*  But then on my social media feeds, I was seeing a lot of discourse, a lot of the side
*  that I wasn't really familiar with.
*  And that was Asian Americans for affirmative action.
*  And I was thinking, is my opinion wrong?
*  Am I misreading something?
*  And after I've consumed some media and talking to a few people who have differing opinions
*  about affirmative action, one thing that I mainly agree with is that I think the misconception
*  within the Asian American community is that our spots are being taken away by black
*  and brown students and those minorities, although they only make up a very tiny percentage
*  of actual population in classrooms and elite colleges like Harvard.
*  And in this Supreme Court decision, it seems like Asian people are being pitted against
*  black and brown minorities.
*  But that conveniently ignores the fact that legacy and trust fund and donations on all
*  those things exist.
*  And even though that's not the focus of the case, it still is like the underlying major
*  player at hand that is being ignored.
*  So there's a misunderstanding in the Asian American community about the culprit.
*  Yeah.
*  So what exactly is your position on race conscious admissions policies now?
*  How would you describe it?
*  Can I not answer this?
*  Because I'm not exactly sure yet.
*  Still I'm trying to figure it out.
*  I can't say for certain whether I'm one side or the other.
*  I still have feelings of both sides kind of just mix all together.
*  Could you talk through some of the uncertainties?
*  Because I think that's a very natural reaction, right?
*  This is a complicated thing.
*  And there are a lot of different groups with different views on it as you've laid out.
*  I mean, is there something that you're grappling with?
*  So part of me, especially initially, it feels like my results could be different if I was
*  applying in the next mission cycle.
*  But also like majority of me and another part of me feels like, you know, that's not the
*  case.
*  Let's be real.
*  It's not just about race.
*  It's about so many other factors.
*  And it makes me feel frustrated that I can't attribute one thing to all of my rejection
*  in the way that my college results played out.
*  Because like there are so many other underlying factors that are not revealed.
*  So I can't say for certain that it was my race that didn't get me into these schools.
*  But part of me feels like it did play a role.
*  However, I also am sympathetic to the argument.
*  And I very much agree with the argument that we still need to have diverse classrooms.
*  We still need to maintain race conscious acceptances.
*  And I think that this Supreme Court case ruling was also not to make emissions color
*  blind.
*  Like in reality, we still have so many other things like legacy and recruited athletes
*  that are still being given an advantage.
*  And at the end of the day, that harms Asian Americans too.
*  And I realize that the issue at hand is also about the culture that exists within the Asian
*  American community, especially the community of immigrant parents who want the best for
*  their children.
*  But usually the best for the children, quote-unquote, often equates to an elite institution.
*  And so many mental health issues arise from the expectations placed upon children at
*  a very early age.
*  And I think I'm also a product of that.
*  So I think redefining expectation, redefining success, and redefining the American dream
*  also is something that we have to work on as a community.
*  And that's what I believe.
*  How do you feel about starting Boston University in the fall?
*  There's a lot.
*  It's an nervous energy.
*  I think I'm, of course, very excited to start.
*  I'm excited to take classes that I want to take and have opportunities that it didn't
*  have in high school.
*  But I also feel like this is not an anyway, an indicator of my potential.
*  It's just a matter of like what I make of the college experience.
*  How does your mom feel about you going to Boston University?
*  How she feels very proud actually, like Boston University is something to be so grateful
*  for.
*  And the tuition thing is not going to happen.
*  She is 100% willing to support me.
*  She still has some dreams for me and some expectations for me.
*  Like she wants me to go to grad school.
*  But it's more like what is the person that I will become in college and not so much
*  like what is her dream that I will achieve, you know?
*  I mean, to that point, Jia, your mom had really valued these elite schools, right?
*  And now she's saying what matters is who you become as a person.
*  What has changed her viewpoint on all of this?
*  I think it's just realizing that college admissions is very arbitrary nowadays to a point where
*  it's almost comical how my results turn out because not a single person I can think of
*  would have expected this for me.
*  And foundationally like putting up all of our dreams and all of our goals into a school
*  is very silly as well.
*  So I'm very happy that I have a person who I've become throughout high school and the
*  person that I am today.
*  And my parents also know that going on, I'll make the most of my resources and environment.
*  And I don't see your school name as an indicator of success or anything to indicate yourself
*  worth.
*  Well, Jia, I really, really thank you for taking the time to talk to me.
*  Thank you so much.
*  And congratulations about getting into BU and good luck there.
*  It's a really, really good school.
*  I appreciate it.
*  Thank you so much for your time.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  It was stronger, more energized, and yes, more united than ever in its history.
*  Indeed, more vital to our shared future.
*  It didn't happen by accident.
*  It wasn't ever.
*  On Wednesday, members of NATO concluded their two-day summit in Lithuania, pledging unity
*  in their support for Ukraine, but declining to invite the country in to the alliance.
*  NATO leaders said that Ukraine, quote, belonged in NATO, but they refused to spell out when or
*  how Ukraine would eventually become a member.
*  And inflation slowed significantly in June, with the consumer price index climbing 3%.
*  Far below its 9% peak last summer.
*  The numbers offered some of the most hopeful news for consumers since the Federal Reserve
*  started trying to rein in price increases 16 months ago.
*  They were also a potential sign that the economy might yet avoid a recession.
*  Finally, Milan Cundera, the Czech-born French author, who became one of the most influential
*  figures of 20th century literature, died on Tuesday in his home in Paris.
*  He was 94.
*  His best-known work was his 1984 novel, The Unbearable Lightness of Being.
*  He won fame for depicting oppression in central Europe under Communist rule, and for exploring
*  issues of identity and totalitarianism.
*  His writings were banned in Communist Czechoslovakia, and he went into exile in France in 1975.
