# How Affirmative Action Changed Their Lives
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FczGK9Q31jk)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernese, and this is The Daily.
*  Two weeks ago today, the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action, upending years of
*  admissions practices at selective colleges.
*  Since then, The Daily has been talking to Americans around the country about that decision.
*  Yeah, this admissions cycle for college was very tough on me.
*  And there was a lot of speculation that it was because of my race.
*  I've always been pro-affirmative action.
*  It's always maybe a little uncomfortable in the same way that I think it makes most
*  people of color who had the benefits of affirmative action a little uncomfortable.
*  I guess we all expected that affirmative action would be a temporary arrangement.
*  But it looks like every time we take a few steps forward, we take three steps backwards.
*  Today, we hear from three people who explain how affirmative action changed the course
*  of their lives, the complicated feelings they have about it, and what they think of
*  a future without the policy.
*  It's Thursday, July 13th.
*  Dr. Sims, what was going through your head when you first heard the news?
*  Well, I was pissed.
*  I've been fighting my whole life.
*  I'm getting sick of this crap, you know, because anytime it looks like we as a people are getting
*  an advantage, people just freak out.
*  They freak out.
*  They've been given everything they need.
*  I don't see why we need to give them anything else.
*  Oh, I got in a discussion with a Trump supporter the other day.
*  That's off the point.
*  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm going to bring you back.
*  I'm bringing you back.
*  Bring me back.
*  Bring me back, Sabrina.
*  Bring me back.
*  Go ahead.
*  Okay.
*  Let me ask you, Dr. Sims, if you could just introduce yourself for me.
*  Tell me your name, your age, your profession, and where you live.
*  Okay.
*  Richard V. Sims III, MD, 75 and a half years old, Emeritus Professor of Medicine, University
*  of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine.
*  My place of residence is Vestavia Hills, Alabama.
*  Tell me a little bit about your background, where you grew up, what your parents did,
*  and then we can talk about your education.
*  I lived in Summit, New Jersey from 1948 when I was born until 1966 when I graduated from
*  high school.
*  My father grew up in Mississippi and stuff, so he knew what the South was about.
*  He was determined to get out of there.
*  Do you know if they were descendants of enslaved people?
*  Do you know what their backgrounds were?
*  All of them were enslaved.
*  My mother's family, they were all enslaved.
*  They all made a lot of money for the people who enslaved them, and they didn't ever get
*  anything for it.
*  They made a lot of wealth for the people in this country for free.
*  They found the North to be less of a terroristic, murderous place as the South and exploitative
*  place as the South, but they still found that there was racism even in the North.
*  I know my father decided he wanted to be a surgeon.
*  When he applied to medical school, he was accepted, but when they found out he was Black,
*  they said, well, we can't take you.
*  All the other predominantly white institutions, they all rejected him, so he wound up at Howard.
*  I can tell you that my father was a family medicine practitioner, and he could not admit
*  a patient to the local hospital on his own.
*  He had to get a white attending to take care of his patients, although he was a very smart,
*  very qualified person, but they wouldn't let him admit patients.
*  And Dr. Sims, tell me a little bit about your own impulse in terms of college and education.
*  You were watching your father doing his practice.
*  How did you think about your education?
*  I was driven.
*  I was driven.
*  I was in the top 10 people in my class when I graduated.
*  Most of my courses were advanced placement except for math.
*  I'm sorry, I don't mean to brag, but you asked me.
*  I did.
*  So then I went to Amherst, which was my number one school.
*  And remind me when you graduated from Amherst.
*  1970.
*  That's a long time ago.
*  That's a long time ago.
*  And I knew I liked people.
*  I loved science and math and so forth.
*  And my dad was my hero.
*  I said, okay, I'm going to med school.
*  So I just applied to a bunch of places, some places I didn't think I had a chance to get into.
*  I wasn't one of the top students in the class.
*  I mean, I was a solid B plus student.
*  I was up in my class.
*  I graduated with honors, but I wasn't Harvard category.
*  I mean, I'm convinced that affirmative action got me into Harvard because they hardly even
*  talked to me before I got my acceptance.
*  How do you understand that?
*  I mean, how do you feel about that?
*  What was your kind of thinking?
*  I feel fine about it.
*  I feel fine about it.
*  I mean, everybody who is there had some kind of, you know, it takes you use a lever to
*  move something large.
*  Everybody there had a lever, you know, with the legacies where the parents went to the
*  medical school.
*  You had people who were big donors, whose kids were coming there and that sort of thing.
*  So why should I feel badly about my little lever?
*  Because I didn't have nothing else.
*  So remind me what your Harvard experience was like.
*  So you walk onto campus the first time, fall of 1970.
*  Well, I got dazzled.
*  I mean, you know, Harvard Medical School.
*  I mean, I was like, there were stars in my eye.
*  What did you think?
*  I got hypnotized by the name.
*  And I said, oh my gosh.
*  Do you have a memory for me, Dr. Sims, of being in med school and kind of just like
*  you?
*  I do.
*  I was in the rotation and pediatrics at Austin Children's Hospital.
*  And the whole time I was there, as was my way, I would ask the supervising residents
*  and the attendees about how am I doing?
*  Is there any way I can improve my presentations?
*  Is there anything I need to know in terms of feedback?
*  And they said, oh, no, you're doing fine.
*  You're doing fine.
*  And I wound up with a D in the course, which told me that they didn't expect anything better.
*  And I was in the top half of my class.
*  I wasn't near, you know, the top 10 or nothing like that, because there were some really,
*  really outstanding, bright students there.
*  There were also, you know, some of those legacies.
*  There were nothing impressive at all.
*  But people, you know, had low expectations for you, you know, would sometimes say things
*  that would indicate that they didn't think you belonged there and that it was unlikely
*  you were going to be successful and you were taking the place that somebody else should
*  have had. And I mean, there's no question the name on my CV has opened doors.
*  It has opened doors for me that ordinarily I think would not have opened.
*  But that just made for a terrible experience.
*  I didn't even go to my graduation.
*  I was just so angry.
*  I just said, I'm not going to graduation.
*  That's the thing. I'm getting out of here.
*  But that was probably short sighted on my part.
*  I mean, I should have done it for my parents.
*  Yeah, you know, so that they could see that their sonny boy had actually got through the place.
*  Hi, Professor Harper.
*  Hi, how are you? Tyler's fine, but thank you.
*  I'm very good. I'm very good.
*  Nice to meet you.
*  Nice to meet you, too.
*  So why don't you do me a favor and just ID yourself for me.
*  Tell me your name, your age, where you live and what you do for a living.
*  Sure. My name is Tyler Austin Harper.
*  I'm 31 years old.
*  I live in Scarborough, Maine, and I teach environmental studies at Bates College.
*  So let's talk a little bit about your background, Tyler, and where you grew up.
*  Tell me about your family and your parents.
*  Yeah, absolutely. So I was born and raised in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania.
*  For better or worse, central Pennsylvania is a pretty rural place.
*  Right. So, you know, I grew up really close to the abolition trail.
*  That was a great and quiet place to be a kid, particularly when I was growing up.
*  It was a very colorblind place.
*  You know, being a good person in that area meant not talking about race,
*  not asking people about their race and pretending it doesn't exist politely.
*  And so I'll be honest with you, I was pretty naive about race.
*  It was not something I ever spent much time thinking about,
*  which I think surprises people because I grew up as a brown person
*  in a very, very white part of the country.
*  My biological father, who is black, split when I was pretty young.
*  So I was raised by a single mother.
*  Until I was about 10, my mother remarried to my adoptive father,
*  who's a wonderful man.
*  And just because we're about to be talking about affirmative action, Tyler,
*  your mom, is she white?
*  She is, yes. Got it.
*  My mother had a year or two of college, but had me very young.
*  And finishing a four year degree was not in the cards.
*  And I think she really wanted me to do what she hadn't been able to complete,
*  which was a four year college degree.
*  So she was always really clear, hell or high water, I'd be going to college.
*  You'd be going to college.
*  I was a curious student, I would say, not always the most motivated,
*  I'll be honest.
*  I spent a lot of time fishing and playing guitar.
*  But, you know, I did OK in terms of grades.
*  Like most high school students, I was required by the school to take the PSATs,
*  you know, the precursor to the SATs, and was very shocked to find
*  when I got my results back that I had done really well.
*  And at that point, the guidance counselor and some other folks
*  were telling me that I should think about a different caliber of institution
*  than I think I previously had in mind.
*  So I applied early decision to Haverford, and that was sort of all she wrote.
*  So at the time that you applied to college,
*  how did you identify yourself in terms of your race at that point?
*  I don't recall how I specifically checked boxes on my Haverford application form.
*  When available, I generally have checked black and white.
*  If you can check both.
*  A lot of times you can actually only check one.
*  In those cases, I've always since I was a kid, I've always checked one.
*  I've always checked the other one.
*  I've always checked the other one.
*  I've always checked the other one.
*  I've always checked the other one.
*  I've always checked the black box.
*  I've always checked the black box.
*  I've always checked the black box.
*  So you said you had excellent scores going into college.
*  But was there an element of race as well?
*  Was affirmative action also a play there?
*  Do you have any sense of that?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember really clearly my Haverford interview where the interviewer was asking me about
*  my hobbies.
*  And I mentioned I used to do competitive bass fishing tournaments really seriously.
*  Oh, my gosh.
*  Wow.
*  And so I was actually, to my knowledge, the youngest person to go to the state championship
*  when I was 16.
*  And she thought that was delightful.
*  But she said a number of things along the lines of that's very a curious hobby for someone
*  of your background.
*  I didn't really know what she meant by my background because I'm from an area where
*  a lot of people fish.
*  So I thought I had the exact background for someone who would do this kind of thing.
*  And I gradually came to realize she meant my racial background.
*  A black fisherman was not something they ran into a lot.
*  And she really fixated on that, asked me a ton of questions about it.
*  And I think it was one of the reasons they were interested in me.
*  She thought I had a curious background, she kept saying.
*  Based on the tone of my conversation with the admissions officer, it was very clear
*  that they were very excited to be talking to a person of color, especially a person
*  of color that had scores they were excited about.
*  Well, how did that make you feel?
*  What did you think about that?
*  I've always had mixed feelings about affirmative action, very grateful for it.
*  I think it's important.
*  I think it's necessary.
*  But it's also just uncomfortable to realize you are somewhere whether you deserve to be
*  there or not because of the color of your skin.
*  As I left Haverford and went on to my PhD program, I began tutoring the first summer
*  after grad school as a way to make extra money during the summers.
*  And it was really once I started tutoring that I became fully aware of the extent to
*  which affirmative action seemed to have gone off the rails and really problematic and quite
*  disturbing directions.
*  You know, I was somebody getting a literature PhD.
*  My bread and butter was helping them with their writing and their college essay in particular.
*  And I came to realize very swiftly that this intense concern about leveraging, minimizing
*  or maximizing one's identity in ways that would be legible and beneficial in the admissions
*  process was something most of these students seem to have in mind.
*  Do you remember, Tyler, the first time you started encountering this?
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  The first student I encountered who had this mindset was a Chinese American student who
*  I tutored in Queens.
*  And I arrived and she has all our materials.
*  And she wanted me to look through them.
*  And she asked me to read them to make sure they didn't seem too Asian.
*  And I laughed because I thought she was being ironic.
*  And she was like, No, I'm serious.
*  And she pulled out her CV and was like, I've been wondering, can I keep chess and math
*  club on here?
*  Or do those seem too Asian?
*  Like, are those too stereotypical?
*  And so we ended up having like a 20 minute conversation about whether or not chess and
*  math club are too stereotypically Asian to put on her CV or if it would actually be better
*  for her just not to mention that she had done those.
*  I thought it was kind of odd, very sad, a little strange and slightly amusing.
*  I thought this would be a one off kind of thing.
*  But these kinds of conversations were basically the norm throughout my tutoring.
*  And these were not cynically conspiring students that desperately were just trying to rig the
*  system.
*  It was very clear to me that they felt that this is what was expected of them.
*  This is what was wanted from them.
*  And they were just trying to do it as best they could.
*  The Supreme Court hands down the ruling that overturns affirmative action.
*  What do you think?
*  What was the first thing that came to your mind?
*  I think what I thought is that things are just going to get worse.
*  And you know, I think there's going to be some efforts to figure out ways to maintain
*  the current level of diversity in ways that are compliant with the law.
*  I think some institutions will do this.
*  I think I work at an institution that will do this.
*  But I think a lot of the negative externalities of affirmative action are going to get worse.
*  And get worse how, Tyler?
*  Tell me about that.
*  I think it leads to an atmosphere in which race and value are deeply intertwined in these
*  students' consciousness as they're entering these institutions.
*  And I don't know that that leaves once they're there.
*  And why does the decision, though, make that more the case?
*  Sure, because colleges are still going to want to diversify.
*  And the options they're going to have for identifying diverse students is going to be
*  through the prism of the college essay.
*  There are not going to be some of the other mechanisms available to identify students
*  of color.
*  And so students of color are going to be forced to or feel compelled to lean more caricature-ishly
*  into their racial identity, right?
*  And to present versions of their racial identity that will be the most legible to admissions
*  officers.
*  Other students might find creative ways to be racially ambiguous, right?
*  Make it a little harder for colleges to read, you know, what someone's racial identity might
*  be.
*  I mean, that's my prediction, yeah.
*  I think we're going to be left with all of the negative externalities of affirmative
*  action without the benefits of actual structural redress and opportunity that accompanied a
*  system that was admittedly imperfect but better than the alternative.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, when the Supreme Court decision came out, I was, like a lot of Asian Americans celebrating.
*  My family was actually very happy too.
*  Just saying, oh, this is good for us.
*  Like, this is kind of like a win for the community.
*  And I kind of felt that initially too.
*  And was that in part because of your college admissions process?
*  Yes, yeah.
*  So, my name is Jia Shin.
*  I'm currently 18 years old.
*  I recently just graduated from Tanaflay High School.
*  So that's in Tanaflay, New Jersey.
*  And I will be attending Boston University to study journalism in the fall.
*  My parents are immigrants.
*  They immigrated from South Korea when they were in their late 20s.
*  It took a long time, a lot of hard work for them to get to where they are today.
*  Right now, my mom is an accountant and my dad works as a bank examiner.
*  I grew up in a pretty affluent town with a lot of resources.
*  My parents had done everything to provide me with the best opportunities possible.
*  The reason why we live in the area that we do with a good public school education is
*  because they want me to get the best education possible that was at the forefront of our
*  family values and what we wanted most for us.
*  And when you were growing up, did your parents talk to you about what your goals should be
*  in terms of education?
*  What their expectations were of you?
*  So a lot of expectations were placed upon me at an early age to be a gifted child, to
*  study hard, and definitely to attend an elite college.
*  And that was always the priority.
*  My mom used state school as a threat.
*  She'd say like, you're either going to an Ivy or Rutgers.
*  There's no in between.
*  I'm not paying for your tuition if you don't get into an Ivy.
*  Wow.
*  GPA was always first.
*  That was just the kind of pressure I grew up under.
*  And it made me feel like my self-worth was tied to a school or tied to my results, even
*  though that's completely not the case.
*  What do you think was behind your mom emphasizing elite schools in particular, you know, Ivy
*  League schools?
*  What was she trying to say there?
*  I think she was saying this coming out from her own lived experiences and insecurities
*  and the hardships that she's been through.
*  She honestly like works harder than anyone else I know.
*  She can't go out because she's working.
*  And if she's not working, she's taking care of me or my brother, or she's giving rides
*  or she's cooking.
*  So she never really had a life outside of her work and her family.
*  She thought that me having an elite education at an elite institution meant that it would
*  unlock a lot more opportunities.
*  In the end, it comes down to money.
*  She didn't want me to be tied down to just working, working, working, just like she did.
*  But rather she wanted me to have financial freedom.
*  She wanted me to have the freedom to pursue what I'm passionate about.
*  At the end of the day, I think that's a very noble dream.
*  It's very selfless.
*  But that's kind of why she pushed me so hard to achieve success at an Ivy League institution.
*  So tell me about your high school experience.
*  What was it like at high school?
*  Okay, so yeah, throughout high school, I was very ambitious as a student.
*  And I was very dedicated and committed to extracurriculars.
*  What's an example, Jia?
*  Tell me what you did.
*  Okay, so for two years, I worked as co-editor-in-chief for my newspaper and my school's literary
*  magazine.
*  I self-published a book talking about the different challenges that we as Gen Z face.
*  I created a non-profit organization for youth mental health.
*  I did varsity cheer and martial arts.
*  I also played the violin.
*  I've been playing for 12 years now.
*  I was a concertmaster of my school's orchestra.
*  I had a 4.56 GPA.
*  After my junior year, I attended a creative writing summer program at University of Pennsylvania.
*  I loved just all the instructors and the assignments.
*  Connected so well with the people, loved the culture.
*  For me, U Penn felt like somewhere that I could call home.
*  So I applied early decision there.
*  And the day before my decision came out, people around me were saying, like, oh, you are going
*  to get like, they were already making their Instagram stories, posts to like say like,
*  yeah, you got it.
*  My friends were like, they had cake prepared.
*  They had all these things prepared.
*  But they said if you don't get in, who is gonna like who's gonna get in.
*  So it was kind of like a no brainer that I would go to, not even just an Ivy, but at
*  least a top 20 in the institution.
*  Overall that day, I was like so nervous.
*  I couldn't eat.
*  I could barely sleep at night too.
*  And when it was time for me to open my decision, my family was behind me looking at my laptop.
*  They were all excited to check.
*  And then it was 7pm when decisions were supposed to come out.
*  I still remember it was 7.02 when it came out, because I had to wait two whole minutes,
*  which felt like forever.
*  But when I opened my letter, it said like, sorry, we regret to inform you dot dot dot.
*  And that was not even a possibility in my mind, actually.
*  I think that was probably the biggest shock of my life.
*  I mean, I've only lived 18 years, but it was still a huge shock for me and my family.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  But I got rejected, not even deferred.
*  And what happened?
*  What did you do?
*  Well, after that, I was just still in shock.
*  I wasn't really feeling anything.
*  I was really numb.
*  But I was also so upset that I didn't even know how to react.
*  I decided to just stay up all night working on my other applications for my other schools.
*  And I added a bunch more to my college list because I was scared that if this is how it's
*  going to play out, then I better try out everything possible and give my all to all of these schools
*  instead of attaching my dream to one school.
*  Right.
*  So I applied to 19 schools in total.
*  And it was just one rejection after another.
*  Even the schools that I was confident I would get into, they were just no's.
*  And by the end of it, I ended up only getting into two, one of which was my state school
*  Rutgers.
*  The other one was Boston University.
*  And I realized that these two options are my options, and I should be grateful for them.
*  But I had never expected anything like this to be my reality.
*  And no one had an explanation for why.
*  We couldn't attribute it to anything.
*  I just felt really horrible about myself.
*  I felt like I couldn't really show my face really in public.
*  I felt ashamed.
*  Like I was having this big sticker in my head that said loser, I didn't make it.
*  But my mom also said that she couldn't meet with her friends.
*  She felt embarrassed too.
*  And I totally understood because in my community, there's also a culture of a lot of gossip
*  and seeing if your kid didn't turn out this way, then it means you didn't really succeed
*  as maybe a parent or something went wrong, like what went wrong there.
*  In the days and weeks after you got your admissions decisions, what were your family
*  members and friends and community members saying to you?
*  One thing that kind of stood out to me was people said you just got affirmative actioned
*  like as a verb.
*  Oh, wow.
*  What did that mean?
*  You just got affirmative actioned.
*  It was people telling me that I was disadvantaged because of affirmative action in my race.
*  It was people talking about the race box and how big of a deal it was.
*  That's what people have said either as a joke or passing comment.
*  So just thinking about all of this was kind of what informed my beliefs about affirmative
*  action at the time.
*  Gia, what was going through your mind when you heard that the Supreme Court had overturned
*  affirmative action?
*  It was actually a lot of conflicting emotions.
*  Initially, part of me was like very happy that this would be the future.
*  Also part of me was feeling bitter because I felt like I was wrong in some senses or
*  screwed over as a lot of people were buzzing around me saying if you just apply to your
*  later you'd end up at an elite institution.
*  And also I want to say that my view changed since then.
*  Tell me about that.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, a lot of Asian Americans wanted affirmative action to be overturned.
*  But then on my social media feeds, I was seeing a lot of discourse, a lot of the side that
*  I wasn't really familiar with and that was Asian Americans for affirmative action.
*  And I was thinking, is my opinion wrong?
*  Like am I misreading something?
*  And after I've consumed some media and talking to a few people who have differing opinions
*  about affirmative action, one thing that I mainly agree with is that I think the misconception
*  within the Asian American community is that our spots are being taken away by Black and
*  Brown students and those minorities, although they only make up a very tiny percentage of
*  actual population in classrooms in elite colleges like Harvard.
*  In this Supreme Court decision, it seems like Asian people are being pitted against Black
*  and Brown minorities, but that conveniently ignores the fact that legacy and trust fund
*  and donations on all those things exist.
*  And even though that's not the focus of the case, it still is like the underlying major
*  player at hand that is being ignored.
*  So there's a misunderstanding in the Asian American community about the culprit.
*  Yeah.
*  So what exactly is your position on race conscious admissions policies now?
*  How would you describe it?
*  Can I not answer this?
*  Because I'm not exactly sure yet.
*  So I'm like trying to figure it out.
*  I can't say for certain, like whether I'm one side or the other, I still have like feelings
*  of both sides kind of just mixed all together.
*  Could you talk through some of the uncertainties?
*  Because I think that's a very natural reaction, right?
*  This is a complicated thing and there are a lot of different groups with different views
*  on it as you've laid out.
*  I mean, is there something that you're grappling with?
*  So part of me, especially initially, feels like my results could be different if I was
*  applying in the next admission cycle, but also like majority of me.
*  And another part of me feels like, you know, that's not the case.
*  Let's be real.
*  It's not just about race.
*  It's about so many other factors.
*  And it makes me feel frustrated that I can't attribute one thing to all of my rejection
*  in the way that my college results played out.
*  Because like there are so many other underlying factors that are not revealed.
*  So I can't say for certain that it was my race that didn't get me into these schools,
*  but part of me feels like it did play a role.
*  However, I also am sympathetic to the argument and I very much agree with the argument that
*  we still need to have diverse classrooms.
*  We still need to maintain race conscious acceptances.
*  And I think that the Supreme Court case ruling was also not to make admissions colorblind.
*  Like in reality, we still have so many other things like legacy and recruited athletes
*  that are still being given an advantage.
*  And at the end of the day, that harms Asian Americans too.
*  And I realize that the issue at hand is also about the culture that exists within the Asian
*  American community, especially the community of immigrant parents who want the best for
*  their children.
*  But usually this best for the children, quote unquote, often equates to an elite institution.
*  And so many mental health issues arise from the expectations placed upon children at a
*  very early age.
*  And I think I'm also a product of that.
*  So I think redefining expectations, redefining success, and redefining the American dream
*  also is something that we have to work on as a community.
*  And that's what I believe.
*  How do you feel about starting Boston University in the fall?
*  There's a lot of nervous energy, I think.
*  I'm, of course, very excited to start.
*  I'm excited to take classes that I want to take and have opportunities that I didn't
*  have in high school.
*  But I also feel like this is not in any way an indicator of my potential.
*  It's just a matter of what I make of the college experience.
*  How does your mom feel about you going to Boston University?
*  Now, she feels very proud, actually.
*  Like, Boston University is something to be so grateful for.
*  And the tuition thing is it's not going to happen.
*  Like, she is 100 percent willing to support me.
*  She still has some dreams for me and some expectations for me.
*  Like, she wants me to go to grad school.
*  But it's more like, what is the person that I will become in college?
*  And not so much like, what is her dream that I will achieve?
*  You know?
*  I mean, to that point, Jia, your mom had really valued these elite schools, right?
*  And now she's saying what matters is who you become as a person.
*  What has changed her viewpoint on all of this?
*  I think it's just realizing that college admissions is very arbitrary nowadays,
*  to the point where it's almost comical how many results turned out,
*  because not a single person I can think of would have expected this from me.
*  And foundationally, like, putting up all of our dreams and all of our goals into a school
*  is very silly as well.
*  So I'm very happy that I'm of the person who I've become throughout high school
*  and the person that I am today.
*  And my parents also know that going on, I'll make the most of my resources and environment.
*  And I don't see your school name as an indicator of success
*  or anything to indicate your self-worth.
*  Well, Jia, I really, really thank you for taking the time to talk to me.
*  Thank you so much.
*  And congratulations about getting into BU and good luck there.
*  It's a really, really good school.
*  I appreciate it.
*  Thank you so much for your time.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  NATO is stronger, more energized, and yes, more united than ever in its history.
*  Indeed, more vital to our shared future.
*  It didn't happen by accident.
*  It wasn't inevitable.
*  On Wednesday, members of NATO concluded their two-day summit in Lithuania,
*  pledging unity in their support for Ukraine,
*  but declining to invite the country in to the alliance.
*  NATO leaders said that Ukraine, quote, belonged in NATO,
*  but they refused to spell out when or how Ukraine would eventually become a member.
*  And inflation slowed significantly in June,
*  with the consumer price index climbing 3%, far below its 9% peak last summer.
*  The numbers offered some of the most hopeful news for consumers
*  since the Federal Reserve started trying to rein in price increases 16 months ago.
*  They were also a potential sign that the economy might yet avoid a recession.
*  Finally, Milan Kundera, the Czech-born French author
*  who became one of the most influential figures of 20th century literature,
*  died on Tuesday in his home in Paris.
*  He was 94.
*  His best-known work was his 1984 novel, The Unbearable Lightness of Being.
*  He won fame for depicting oppression in Central Europe under communist rule,
*  and for exploring issues of identity and totalitarianism.
*  His writings were banned in communist Czechoslovakia,
*  and he went into exile in France in 1975.
