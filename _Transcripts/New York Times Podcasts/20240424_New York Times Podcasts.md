# Is $60 Billion Enough to Save Ukraine?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgvubb1QbW4)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Late last night, a long-delayed aid package for Ukraine passed its final hurdle in Congress,
*  throwing the embattled country a $60 billion lifeline.
*  But given Ukraine's desperation on the battlefield, will that be enough to save it?
*  Today, my colleague Mark Santora explains.
*  It's Wednesday, April 24th.
*  So Mark, last night, after many, many months, the U.S. Congress finally approved an aid
*  package to Ukraine.
*  It passed in the Senate just before 10 p.m.
*  And of course, it's very, very substantial, billions and billions of dollars.
*  But we also know that the war is not going well at all for the Ukrainians right now.
*  You've been in Ukraine covering this war since the beginning in 2022.
*  You're in Kiev right now.
*  So my question for you is this.
*  What does all of this money mean for Ukraine at this point in the war?
*  Is it going to make a difference given the state of things?
*  100% it's going to make a difference.
*  The Ukrainians have been waiting for months and months for this news.
*  $60 billion, of which $46 billion is military aid, basically is the equivalent of all that
*  the United States has given Ukraine over the past two years in total.
*  So it's a lot of money.
*  It's a lot of supplies.
*  It can buy a lot of what Ukraine needs.
*  But they need it right now because the situation across the front has been turning increasingly
*  grim for the Ukrainians who find themselves outmanned and outgunned.
*  So on that point, Mark, it's been a couple of months now since we last talked about the
*  war on the show.
*  And you know, I've been reading your coverage, our colleagues' coverage, and it looks like
*  a very desperate situation for the Ukrainians.
*  Remind us why that is.
*  Right.
*  So first of all, if we just step back a little.
*  First year of the war was one that started with shock at the breadth of what Russia was
*  trying to do, invade and capture a nation of 40 million people, the largest in Europe.
*  And then it was about Russian failure and Ukrainian success in pushing back that invasion,
*  first protecting the capital, then reclaiming like 50% of the country.
*  Right.
*  That was the David and Goliath story.
*  That was year one.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  And I think Ukraine surprised the world.
*  They surprised the Kremlin.
*  And maybe even they surprised themselves a bit.
*  But the year ended on sort of this optimistic note that Ukraine cannot just hold their own,
*  but they can take the fight to the Russians.
*  And then we get to year two.
*  And year two is this year of ghastly violence, but very little change along the front lines.
*  Russia tries to do an offensive, they fail.
*  Ukraine tries to do an offensive, they fail.
*  Russia again, they try and gain more land and largely fail.
*  So you have this sort of back and forth going on.
*  But at the end of year two, something changes.
*  For the first time in the course of the war, USAID first slows and then it basically stops.
*  So as we get into year three now, we see the Ukrainians, they're not just stuck, but they're
*  basically fighting to hold on for dear life.
*  And what does it look like right now to be holding on for dear life?
*  Describe that for us.
*  So Sabrina, there are three main challenges.
*  And the first, most critical, and probably the most obvious, is a shortage of weapons
*  and ammunition for those weapons.
*  It's pretty simple in war.
*  The side that can't shoot back generally loses.
*  And when we would go on visits to the front line over the course of the winter and then
*  into the spring here, what we found were commanders who were rationing their shells.
*  They had maybe one for every three Russian shells in the late winter.
*  And then it went to one for every five Russian shells.
*  And more recently, it's one to ten.
*  So they found themselves not just in a position of being outgunned, but outgunned to such
*  a degree that they might have to fall back.
*  Simply put, running out of bullets.
*  Which is the most basic building block of war.
*  Yeah.
*  In this war, in particular, 80% of the deaths have been from direct fire, from artillery
*  and rockets.
*  And the way the Russians fight, sending wave after wave of soldiers to attack Ukrainian
*  trenches and fortifications, the main way you stop these waves of attacks is kill as
*  many of the attackers as you can.
*  And without artillery, you simply can't kill enough people.
*  And so eventually, their positions will become overrun and they'll have to fall back.
*  And in the past couple months, we've started to really see that and the impact it's having
*  on the battlefield as Ukraine loses territory.
*  Okay, so that's artillery.
*  What else?
*  What I think almost every Ukrainian would tell you what they desperately need are air
*  defense systems and the munitions that make those systems work.
*  So when we're talking about air defense systems, we're talking about a whole range of stuff
*  from basically guys on the back pickup trucks with machine guns who are searching for Russian
*  drones in the sky to the most sophisticated air defense systems that only America can
*  provide, which are called the Patriot batteries.
*  So Russia's most sophisticated missiles fly like 10 times the speed of sound.
*  That's where you need something like Patriot.
*  And these are the only thing Ukraine has really that can shoot down Russian ballistic missiles.
*  So these are like defending the skies, basically.
*  Like it's very, very dangerous to not have them.
*  It's not just dangerous for the people in the cities and towns.
*  It's really dangerous for the troops on the front line, because the other thing air defense
*  systems give you is it prevents or at least it deters Russian fighter pilots from flying
*  into the area where these things are operating.
*  So once these air defenses basically ran out, Russian fighter bombers are now basically
*  strafing the front line, flying closer and closer and dropping these massive bombs onto
*  Ukrainian fortifications and also some of these towns and cities that had been out of
*  range of Russian artillery.
*  And Mark, what are we seeing as a result of Ukraine being kind of naked in the sky like
*  this?
*  Well, on the front, it's opened up this whole new challenge, because it's allowed Russian
*  warplanes to basically dip into Russia's almost limitless stock of one ton, two ton big bombs
*  that were built ages ago, but that they can strap wings to and guidance systems and obliterate
*  Ukrainian fortifications.
*  I mean, I'll just tell you personally, you know, whenever you go into a combat zone,
*  it's the noise that strikes you first.
*  The first time I heard these things, it shocked me.
*  We were outside of Avdivka, maybe two miles away.
*  And you just heard this thunder and Russia was dropping at the peak of the battle for
*  Avdivka something like 250 of these in 48 hours, each of them weighing and loaded with
*  more than one ton of explosives.
*  It's really hard to get your head around just how big this is.
*  So the introduction of these in mass along the front has really changed the dynamic and
*  presented all kinds of problems for the Ukrainians.
*  Avdivka, of course, being the town that Russia took this winter after practically obliterating
*  it.
*  Exactly.
*  And so then when you take this all together, the introduction of these heavy bombs, the
*  lack of defense against ballistic missiles, what you see is it's starting to take a growing
*  toll on civilians as well.
*  The UN estimated that in March, we saw a 20% increase in the number of civilian deaths
*  compared to just the month before.
*  And they attributed that mostly to widespread and more successful Russian aerial strikes.
*  So this is really just a disaster for Ukraine, right?
*  I mean, it's running out of almost everything.
*  And this is put in kind of a defensive crouch.
*  It's really a complete turnaround from where it was at the beginning of the war.
*  What's the second challenge Ukraine has been dealing with?
*  Well, this is a challenge that affects really the entire country.
*  And that has to do with the power grid.
*  The ability of Russia to target and target successfully a number of key Ukrainian power
*  generating facilities has had a devastating impact on Ukraine's ability to supply power,
*  particularly in the east.
*  We just came back from Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, where Russia has completely destroyed
*  every single thermal power plant the city had to produce its own power.
*  It's basically trying to bring power from across the country to provide at least a minimal
*  level of energy for critical infrastructure like water and sewage.
*  And people have sometimes as little as two, three hours of power a day.
*  And then if you just pull back a bit, you look across the country.
*  And I met with the head of one of the major power utilities here who said that these strikes,
*  on March 22, really, have been more successful and done more damage to the Ukrainian power
*  grid than even the strikes that occurred in the first winter of war, which if you remember,
*  Sabrina, those almost took down the grid and caused the country to go into a blackout.
*  So Ukraine is in a really tough spot when it comes to power generation.
*  So this all adds up to a pretty serious problem for Ukraine, right?
*  I mean, lack of electricity can really cripple a country's economy.
*  Absolutely, Sabrina.
*  And you know, these power outages, they affect civilians across the country, which brings
*  us to probably our third biggest challenge for Ukraine, which is people.
*  They need soldiers.
*  And this is by all accounts the deadliest war since the end of the Second World War.
*  Even conservative estimates put the number of Ukrainian and Russian soldiers killed and
*  wounded at over a half a million.
*  The Russians are dying probably at a rate of maybe three to one, according to most analysts,
*  although these numbers are fuzzy.
*  So you have a situation where you have this incredibly deadly front and you have people
*  across the country who still, by and large, supporting the military, doing what they can,
*  sewing blankets, donating, building drones, volunteering in many ways.
*  But a lot of people are really just afraid, afraid that if they go volunteer or go into
*  the military, they're going to be put into the infantry right away and then rushed off
*  to the front and put in a trench.
*  And quite frankly, it's really scary.
*  So that is a big problem for Ukraine.
*  If they're not getting the soldiers at the front, then they're not really able to continue
*  their war.
*  So what are they doing to combat that?
*  Well, the main way is something they call mobilization that we would probably call a
*  draft, which is basically recruiting everyone between a certain age to serve in the military.
*  But it was created back in the Soviet era.
*  There are ways that people find around it, for instance, by not registering.
*  Other people have been found to sort of pay bribes to get out of it.
*  A few thousand have fled the country to avoid it.
*  Basically, it was just a mess.
*  And so the Zlinski government knew they needed to rewrite and change this law to give it
*  a bit more order.
*  But that was politically risky because this is a country that does not have a lot of young
*  men.
*  So what's ended up happening is you have the situation where people who signed up more
*  than two years ago are still fighting on the front with very little rest.
*  And the average age of the soldier in the trenches is now 40.
*  Wow, 40.
*  That's really up there for a soldier.
*  Precisely.
*  And the government here was really resistant and afraid of throwing its youngest generation
*  and losing them in this war.
*  But on the flip side, most people here really feel this is an existential war, a struggle
*  for their survival.
*  So if they don't win it, there will be no society for these young people worth growing
*  up in.
*  So earlier this month, President Zlinski relented and he lowered the draft age from 27 to 25.
*  So effectively broadening the pool of potential men he could draft as soldiers, right?
*  So upping his numbers.
*  Exactly.
*  That's the goal.
*  But again, these things take time to translate from legislation and changes to the battlefield.
*  Which of course brings us to this moment and the passage of the aid through Congress.
*  Right.
*  And the key question is what's coming?
*  And perhaps more importantly, how fast is it going to get here?
*  We'll be right back.
*  So the aid package finally passed through Congress.
*  It's real.
*  What does it look like in practice?
*  I mean, what are the actual things that Ukraine is going to be getting?
*  Well, Sabrina, as we're taping this, we don't know precisely, but we do know broadly what's
*  going to be in these first batch of stuff coming here, which is number one, the ammunition
*  for the artillery, number two, the air defense missiles and interceptors for the air defense
*  systems.
*  But most critically, more than each individual thing is quantity.
*  They're going to get resupplies in the kind of quantity they desperately need.
*  As much as each particular thing they need is important, it's also important that they
*  get a lot of them.
*  So essentially they're hoping that in this aid package, they'll be able to replenish
*  their ammunition, their artillery, and take back control of their skies by getting some
*  replenishments of those Patriot missiles that you were telling us about.
*  Precisely.
*  To close the skies and basically repair and fortify and solidify what are currently fraying
*  front lines that are in danger along multiple points of the front.
*  And what else are they going to get?
*  So one of the things they've asked for and wanted since the earliest months of the war,
*  which are precision long range missiles known as ATTACMs.
*  ATTACMs?
*  Yeah, ATTACMs, it's an abbreviation, but it does what it sounds like, which is it attacks
*  and it can attack at distance.
*  And so what Ukraine has wanted desperately is to be able to hit Russia anywhere on Ukrainian
*  territory, including Crimea, where Russian forces are currently based.
*  And for the longest time throughout this war, Ukraine has kind of been having to fight with
*  one hand tied behind its back.
*  Russia can reach any corner of Ukraine, but Ukraine can't even hit Russia on every corner
*  of their own country.
*  And the Biden administration for months and months worried that these weapons could be
*  seen as escalatory in some way by Moscow.
*  But I think the decision was made that Ukraine needs all it can at this moment in the fight.
*  And Ukraine is hoping to use these weapons to go after some targets that have long been
*  None more so than this bridge that connects Crimea to Russia.
*  After Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014, Putin, you know, this is for him the symbol
*  of the connection between Crimea and Russia.
*  And for Ukrainians, it's the exact opposite.
*  They've tried twice now to take it out.
*  They've blown up a truck bomb on it.
*  They've sent maritime drones loaded with explosives to blow up under it.
*  They've done damage to it, but they haven't been able to take it out.
*  And I think anyone who's watched this war knows that this on the list of targets Ukraine
*  has that they think could make a difference, this bridge is high up on that list.
*  It would be important militarily, but also very important symbolically.
*  Like Ukraine would actually be able to strike this important piece of infrastructure for
*  the Russians.
*  Exactly.
*  Okay.
*  So the Americans are actually relenting on their earlier skepticism and actually giving
*  the Ukrainians something that is very precise and potentially damaging for Russia.
*  Right.
*  And the Biden administration has relented and is allowing Ukraine's allies in Europe
*  to provide something else Ukraine desperately wanted, which are F-16 fighter jets.
*  Now these are not part of this military aid package, but it took a decision of the Biden
*  administration to allow these fighter jets to be sent to Ukraine since they're American
*  made.
*  Several European countries have already committed to giving Ukraine dozens of these and pilots,
*  as we speak, have been training on them for months.
*  We don't know when they're going to appear in the skies.
*  Some people think by mid late summer, but that will be another part of what Ukraine
*  thinks is essential to have the kind of layered air defense that will allow it to finally
*  protect its skies from these deadly and relentless bombardments.
*  Okay.
*  So the U.S. is replenishing supplies, but it's also sending stuff that they'd never
*  sent before, including American made F-16s through the Europeans.
*  But what do we know about when it will actually get to Ukraine?
*  What's the timing here?
*  Yeah.
*  So again, this comes back to the question of quantity.
*  I think most people believe here we'll start to see things relatively quickly, that some
*  of this is positioned in Poland already or in Europe.
*  And so the minute after the president signs it, stuff will start moving.
*  But it's a question really of how much they can get and how fast.
*  So we talked earlier about shell hunger, this need of Ukrainian commanders to be able to
*  at least start to match the number of shells the Russians have.
*  And on an average day here, Ukraine can fire 10,000 rounds to Russia's 20,000 rounds.
*  I mean, we're talking thousands and thousands of rounds every day, day after day.
*  So some of it will move in quickly, but it's much harder to calculate when it'll start
*  to have a dynamic impact on the battlefield.
*  But most people think it's probably a month or two before we really see this start to
*  reshape the front line in the fight there, at least.
*  So this is a pretty important moment and a real window of time in which the Russians
*  could kind of take advantage of the Ukrainians not having the stuff yet, right?
*  100 percent.
*  Russia, they know that this stuff is coming.
*  And so now they, whatever plans they had, they might want to step up.
*  The Ukrainian intelligence officials we talked to all think that this next month here is
*  going to be particularly violent.
*  There's going to be things that probably go wrong for Ukraine.
*  And they're trying to brace the public for that.
*  But they also have this now because of this aid bill passed by the U.S. chiefly, this
*  sort of longer term optimism that they know that they're going to stay in the fight whatever
*  these next few weeks bring.
*  And what are we seeing the Russians actually do?
*  What's happening right now on the front?
*  Yeah, so nobody I speak to thinks the fight's going to suddenly speed up somehow very dramatically
*  and massive amounts of land will change hands.
*  The place right now where everyone is watching is a little hilltop town that before the war
*  had maybe 15,000 people is now maybe a few hundred left there that's been turned into
*  basically a Ukrainian garrison just a few miles west of Bakhmut that serves as sort
*  of a key to the eastern front in some ways, because if the Russians can manage to drive
*  the Ukrainians out of there, it would give them these elevated heights to attack some
*  of the last remaining Ukrainian fortified cities in the east.
*  So Ukraine is potentially about to lose a key town to Russia.
*  Right.
*  And Russia is using the full arsenal, the advantage in ammunition and artillery, those
*  big bombs they're dropping from warplanes and their advantage in manpower, point 20
*  to 25,000 soldiers to take this little town that's about five square miles wide.
*  And President Zelensky believes that they're doing it because President Putin wants to
*  have a victory before May 9th.
*  And May 9th is this day that was traditionally meant to celebrate the Soviet Union's victory
*  over Nazi Germany, but that Putin has turned into this martial...
*  Very patriotic display of Russian power, right?
*  This is kind of how he projects his power in the country.
*  And he wants to have a victory to show.
*  Right.
*  So Mark, stepping back here for a moment, you know, we've talked a lot on the show
*  about how the U.S. aid to Ukraine has never really been quite at a level where Ukraine
*  could actually win the war, right?
*  That it stayed at this level where Ukraine doesn't lose, but isn't quite enough to
*  actually help it win.
*  I mean, Ukraine is in this terrible situation.
*  Is this enough to really jolt it into a winning posture?
*  What is this current tranche going to do?
*  Well, Sabrina, first and foremost, what it's going to do is stop the bleeding to some degree.
*  It's going to give Ukraine a better chance of preventing Russia from taking more territory.
*  And I think it's really worth pausing here and remembering what Ukrainian defeat looks
*  like.
*  We don't have to guess.
*  I've been to many places where Russian soldiers occupied and then were driven out.
*  And I visited the mass graves where those Russian soldiers murdered civilians, the torture
*  chambers where they put civilians trying to get information from them.
*  We know that the Russian army leaves a trail of destruction everywhere in its wake.
*  So first and foremost, what the Ukrainians hope is that this robust aid package will
*  to stop the Russian advance and then give them time to regroup and rebuild so that going
*  forward they can take the fight back to the Russians.
*  But that's part two.
*  Part one is surviving.
*  One thing that seems clear to me, you know, just from an American political context, is
*  that this is probably it for American aid.
*  I mean, this is likely the final package, like the end of the line.
*  Do Ukrainians understand that?
*  Well, I think before this long delay in the aid, everyone was looking at a very specific
*  date on the calendar, which was the American presidential election.
*  Nobody's under any illusions that without American support, Ukraine would probably lose
*  this war.
*  They certainly couldn't win this war.
*  And so I think, you know, when we say what's going to happen next, this is enough money
*  to get through the next six months, it seems like, along with stepped up European aid and
*  Ukraine's own domestic production.
*  But I think that everyone is watching anxiously to see what happens in the American presidential
*  election and then what impact that will have on American support for Ukraine in this war.
*  And Mark, what about Ukrainians themselves?
*  What are they saying?
*  You talk to people around the country.
*  It's remarkable how much this package has lifted the spirits of people across the country
*  who quite frankly have been going through some of the worst months since the earliest
*  chaotic days of the war.
*  But Sabrina, it's important to remember and not really be under any illusions here about
*  just how hard it is for Ukrainians, not just the soldiers, but millions of civilians.
*  I recently took a trip out to the city of Kharkiv, and even though there are still 1.3
*  million people there, they are now living under a level bombardment we haven't seen
*  since the first weeks of the war.
*  And what we found in Kharkiv was the question of what's going to happen is not this meta
*  question of how does the war turn out.
*  It is how do I survive the day?
*  We drove around with paramedics, firefighters, and we saw block after block with buildings,
*  all their windows shattered and blown out, some scarred with shrapnel, others reduced
*  to rubble.
*  It's a big city, so even with a relentless missile bombardment, there's still activity.
*  People amazingly go to work and go to coffee shops, but at the same time, they go to bed
*  each night with the knowledge that the next missile might fall either on them or someone
*  they love.
*  So Sabrina, at its most basic level, what this aid does for Ukrainians who on a daily
*  basis are worried about what's going to happen the next day is it allows them to survive,
*  to fight, and to protect their cities from Russian missile strikes and also to, they
*  hope, stabilize the situation on the front.
*  What this package doesn't do is tell us the path forward for how Ukraine can achieve what
*  they really want, their ultimate goal, which is driving the Russians from their land and
*  securing the kind of victory that is both lasting and just in their minds.
*  Mark, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Tuesday, in a major ruling, the Federal Trade Commission banned companies from using
*  non-compete agreements that prevent their employees from working for rival companies.
*  The FTC argued that non-competes, which affect at least a fifth of private sector workers,
*  hold down wages by making it hard to switch jobs, a reliable way of securing a raise.
*  And during his second day of testimony in the hush money trial of Donald Trump, David
*  Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, confirmed his role in what prosecutors
*  have described as conspiracy to promote Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and damage the
*  campaigns of Trump's rivals.
*  On the stand, Pecker recalled a 2015 meeting in which Trump asked how Pecker could help
*  his campaign. In response, Pecker told Trump, quote,
*  Soon after, in coordination with Trump, Pecker said he began to use the National Enquirer
*  to purchase and then kill off negative stories about Trump, including claims that Trump had
*  fathered a child out of wedlock and had had an affair with a former Playboy model.
*  Pecker is expected to resume his testimony tomorrow.
