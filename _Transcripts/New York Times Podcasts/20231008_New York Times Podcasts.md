*  On a sunny morning in a lush area of Eberon, Arthax Dakinith was hard at work on a new invention.
*  Arthax could cast spells to control the elements, manipulate electricity, or send walls
*  to fire raging across enemy battlefields.
*  He hoped his creation would end the century of war, but suddenly, a green fog swept
*  in.
*  Arthax fired a spell to stop the fog, but the fog used Arthax's own spell to attack him.
*  What happened next was completely up to chance, like the odds of a 20-sided die kind of chance,
*  because Arthax wasn't a real person, obviously.
*  He was a character in a Dungeons & Dragons campaign, led by a Texas death row prisoner named Billy
*  Wardlow.
*  My name's Carrie Blakeinger, and I'm a contributor to the New York Times magazine.
*  I'm based in Los Angeles, and I write about Jails and Prisons.
*  This week's Sunday Read is an article I wrote for the magazine about how the man on Texas
*  death row played Dungeons & Dragons, and how two prisoners used that fantasy game to
*  overcome the extreme isolation of death row, and forge a friendship in a place built to prevent that.
*  Texas has almost 200 people on death row.
*  Those are people who were convicted of capital murder and sentenced to be executed.
*  Since the 1970s, the state has executed more people than any other.
*  It's often thought of as the sort of capital of capital punishment.
*  People on death row there wait somewhere around 20 years for execution, and they live in
*  extreme isolation.
*  During those years, they spend almost their entire days in a cell the size of a large elevator.
*  Sometimes men say they don't get to go outside or take showers for days or weeks.
*  They're not allowed to have jobs in the prison, and the only time that they regularly have
*  physical contact with another human being is when the guards handcuff them to take them
*  out of their cells.
*  I started covering Texas death row around 2016.
*  During those first few months, I began hearing that some of the men there were playing Dungeons
*  & Dragons, better known as D&D.
*  I think the stereotype is definitely that D&D is an 80s game for nerds, right?
*  People who don't play are probably most familiar with what this game looks like from seeing
*  it on movies or TV shows.
*  I'm ready to play now, you guys.
*  Catch a joint, any universe in the middle.
*  Or stranger things.
*  Shadow grows in the wall behind you, swallowing you in darkness.
*  It is almost here.
*  What is it?
*  What if it's the Demogorgon?
*  Dr. Jesus, first self-screwed if it's the Demogorgon.
*  It's not the Demogorgon, an army of trouble that's charged with the chamber.
*  Dragonettes.
*  Tojo.
*  It's not what you expect for the image of who you think of when you think of a person
*  on death row, but that's exactly who was playing it.
*  And so I eventually tracked down the linchpin's of this world.
*  And it was two prisoners named Billy Wardlow and Tony Ford.
*  Billy and Tony both went to prison in the 90s when they were 18 years old.
*  For much of the next two decades, they would play D&D together.
*  They helped each other through the morning and loss of family and friends, both in real
*  world interactions and in the guise of this fantasy game setting.
*  I was really struck by how, in some ways, their D&D characters were versions of themselves,
*  of who they would have been if only they had a few more advantages in their lives and
*  made different choices.
*  The game gave them a chance to rewrite their own narratives and envision a world in which
*  they could be the heroes.
*  In reporting this story, I discovered the lengths to which people have to go to try to
*  forge connections in a place that is so thoroughly designed to make that impossible.
*  Even if the only way to do so is in a fantasy world.
*  So here's my article, The Dungeons and Dragons Players of Death Row, read by January Levoix.
*  The first time Tony Ford played Dungeons and Dragons, he was a wiery black kid who would
*  never seen the inside of a prison.
*  His mother, a police officer in Detroit, had quit the force and moved the family to West
*  Texas.
*  To Ford, it seemed like a different world.
*  Strangers talked funny, and El Paso was half desert.
*  But he could skateboard in all that open space, and he eventually befriended a nerdy white
*  kid with a passion for Dungeons and Dragons.
*  Ford fell in love with the role playing game right away.
*  It was complex and cerebral, a saga you could lose yourself in.
*  And in the 1980s, everyone seemed to be playing it.
*  D&D had come out a decade earlier with Little Fanfare.
*  It was a tabletop role playing game known for its miniature figurines and 20-sided dice.
*  Players were entranced by the way it combined a choose your own adventure structure with
*  group performance.
*  In D&D, participants create their own characters, often magical creatures like elves and wizards,
*  to go on quests in fantasy worlds.
*  A narrator and referee, known as the Dungeon Master, guides players through each twist and
*  turn of the plot.
*  There's an element of chance.
*  The role of the die can determine if a blow is strong enough to take down a monster,
*  or whether a stranger will help you.
*  The game has since become one of the most popular in the world, celebrated in nostalgic television
*  shows and dramatized in movies.
*  It is played in homes, at large conventions, and even in prisons.
*  By the time Ford got to high school, he had drifted toward other interests, girls, cars,
*  and friends who sold drugs and ran with gangs.
*  Ford started doing those things too.
*  He didn't get into serious trouble until December 18, 1991.
*  Sometime before 9pm, two black men knocked on the door of a small home on Dale Douglas
*  Drive in southeast El Paso, asking for the man of the house.
*  The woman who answered, Myra Morello, refused to let them in.
*  A few minutes later they returned, breaking down the door and demanding money and jewelry.
*  One opened fire, killing Myra Morello's 18-year-old son, Armando.
*  Within hours, police picked up a suspect who said Ford was his partner.
*  They arrested Ford, who was 18 at the time the following day.
*  He has maintained that the two men who entered the house were brothers, and that he was outside
*  in the car the whole time.
*  There was no physical evidence clearly connecting him to the crime.
*  He was so confident that a jury would believe him that he rejected a plea deal and took
*  his case to trial in July 1993.
*  He lost.
*  By October, at age 20, he was on death row.
*  Back then, death row for men was located in a prison near Huntsville, where hundreds
*  lived in tiny cells.
*  The men were allowed to hang out together, watch television, play basketball, and go to
*  work at prison jobs.
*  And because they were locked behind bars rather than solid doors, they could call out to
*  one another and talk.
*  That was how one day Ford caught familiar words drifting down from the cells above him.
*  Frazes like, I'll cast a spell.
*  Aren't there too many of them?
*  I think you have to roll.
*  It was the sound of dungeons and dragons.
*  Roughly 200 people are on death row in Texas today.
*  Less than half the peak population in 1999.
*  The number of people sentenced to death each year has declined over the past two decades
*  in Texas and across the country, as the cost of prosecuting and defending death penalty
*  cases has ballooned, and public support for capital punishment has dropped.
*  While fewer prisoners arrive on death row each year, they languish there far longer.
*  Some states have had difficulty procuring execution drugs, and landmark court rulings have
*  banned executions of people deemed insane or intellectually disabled.
*  Lawyers can spend years arguing that their clients have such low cognitive capacity
*  that it would be cruel to kill them, or that new DNA technology could prove their innocence.
*  In the early 1980s, prisoners across the country spent an average of six years on death row
*  before they faced execution.
*  Now they can wait for two decades.
*  In many states, prisoners spend those years living in isolation so extreme the United
*  Nations condemns it as torture.
*  All international standards and norms say that the use of isolation should be a last resort,
*  says Merrill Pontier, a Texas-based lawyer who has researched death row conditions.
*  Hundreds of research shows long-term isolation can cause hallucinations and psychosis.
*  Prisoners living in severe isolation, like the men on Texas' death row, turn to suicide
*  at a higher rate than those in the general population.
*  Some simply drop their appeals and volunteer for execution.
*  Not every state keeps its death row population in solitary.
*  Some prisoners sentenced to death in Missouri and California, for example, are mixed with
*  the general population.
*  In Arizona, people on death row can go to the wreck yard and day room in groups for a few
*  hours a day.
*  In North Carolina, they can take prison jobs.
*  In Florida, they can have TVs in their cells.
*  And in Louisiana, they're allowed to have contact visits, where they can hug their friends
*  and families.
*  The death row that Ford entered in Huntsville offered some of those freedoms until an incident
*  in 1998 changed everything.
*  The night of Thanksgiving, seven men staged a breakout.
*  One person stayed behind in the wreck yard to shoot hoops, making enough noise to cover
*  the sound of a perloined hacksaw cutting through a chain-link fence.
*  When the guards spotted the men and started firing at them, six surrendered.
*  Only one made it all the way into the woods.
*  Off-duty prison workers found his body a week later, drowned in a nearby stream.
*  By the time the following summer rolled around, the men on Huntsville's death row knew their
*  lives were about to change for the worse.
*  Officials spoke of imminent transfers to a new, higher security death row in Livingston.
*  As Ford remembers it, he was on the second bus there.
*  In the decades since then, the men on death row at the Allen B. Polonsky unit have spent
*  their days in near-total isolation, only allowed to leave their cells for two hours of recreation,
*  three days a week, alone in day rooms or fenced-in cages, if the guards feel like letting them
*  out or aren't too shorthanded.
*  Sometimes the men say they go weeks without setting foot outdoors or being able to take
*  a shower.
*  The Texas Department of Criminal Justice denies these claims.
*  The prison permits one five-minute phone call every 90 days.
*  Their only regular physical contact with another human is when the guards put them in handcuffs.
*  Even when the men manage to nurture relationships with girlfriends or wives in the free world,
*  they're never able to touch.
*  Just after the start of the pandemic, a new warden made a few changes, setting up TVs in
*  some of the day rooms and letting the men exchange written notes with a handful of prisoners
*  who run a radio station.
*  When the Texas prison system got tablets last year, the men on death row were given limited
*  access to email, which was closely monitored.
*  Even so, Polonsky remains home to one of the most restrictive death rows in the nation.
*  To report this article, I spent several years exchanging letters with men on death row
*  in Texas.
*  Women calls with reporters aren't permitted, and I could only conduct monitored, in-person,
*  one-hour interviews with specific individuals every three months.
*  For some of these men, I was their most regular visitor.
*  To cope with the isolation they face daily, the men on death row spend a lot of their time
*  in search of escape, something to ease the racing thoughts or the crushing regrets.
*  Some read books or find religion.
*  Play games like Scrabble or Jailhouse Chess.
*  Others turn to D&D, where they can feel a small sense of the freedom they have left behind.
*  When Ford first overheard the men on the old Huntsville death row playing D&D, they
*  were engaged in a fast, high-octane version.
*  The gamers were members of the Mexican Mafia, an insular crew that let Ford into their circle
*  after they realized he could draw.
*  The gang's leader, Spider, pulled some strings, Ford recalls, and got him moved to a neighboring
*  cell to serve as his personal artist.
*  He ordered some money drawing intricate Aztec designs in ink.
*  He also began to join their D&D sessions, eventually becoming a dungeon master and running
*  games all over the row.
*  Playing dungeons and dragons is more difficult in prison than almost anywhere else.
*  Just as in the free world, each gaming session can last for hours and is part of a larger
*  campaign that often stretches on for months or years.
*  But in prison, players can't just look up the game rules online.
*  The hardbound manuals that detail settings, characters, and spells are expensive and
*  can be difficult to get past mail room sensors.
*  Some states ban books about the game altogether, while others prohibit anything with a hard
*  cover.
*  Books with maps are generally forbidden, and dice are often considered contraband because
*  they can be used for gambling.
*  Prisoners frequently replace them with game spinners crafted out of paper and typewriter
*  parts.
*  On the old death row, prisoners could call out moves easily through the cell bars.
*  They also had the chance to play face to face, sitting around the metal tables in the
*  common room, or under the sun of the outdoor rackyard.
*  That was where, sometime in the late 1990s, Ford saw four men playing dungeons and dragons
*  together.
*  He asked someone who they were and learned that the six foot five white guy from the country
*  with a buzz cut and glasses was Billy Wardlow.
*  Ford didn't know Wardlow.
*  They were never housed near each other for very long, but he had heard about him.
*  From what everyone that knew something about him said, there was universal agreement that
*  Billy was one of the good guys, Ford wrote in a court document in 2019.
*  Wardlow kept his word and didn't start trouble.
*  He even participated in a hunger strike organized by black prisoners in the mid-1990s to
*  protest the growing frequency of executions.
*  After the Supreme Court reauthorized the death penalty in 1976, Texas accelerated the
*  pace of executions, which jumped to 19 in 1995 from one in 1982, peaking at 40 in 2000.
*  It was surprising to a lot of us black guys that there was some white guy joining in, because
*  in prison, it is hard to organize any efforts across racial and ethnic lines.
*  Ford wrote,
*  The men in Ford's D&D group struggled to bring their gaming world with them to Polonsky.
*  When they arrived, they found that many of their belongings had gone missing or been confiscated.
*  They lost game notes and hand drawn maps, spinners and character sketches.
*  And now they could not sit at a table together to play.
*  They had to rely instead on a variety of clandestine communications, including written messages
*  called kites, passed from cell to cell.
*  For Ford, there was one silver lining.
*  At Polonsky, he could finally play D&D with a death row legend, Billy Wardlow.
*  By death row standards, Wardlow's past was not remarkable.
*  He had grown up in the small town of Cason, Texas, where his father worked in factories,
*  and his mother was a custodian at the first Baptist church.
*  He had an older brother, and would have had two, but his parents' second child died at
*  six months.
*  His mother, Wardlow said, visited the boy's grave to claw at the dirt with her fingers,
*  wailing as she prayed to God for another child.
*  Then came Wardlow.
*  As far back as I can remember, mother told me that I was a gift from God, he wrote in
*  a court filing, but I didn't always feel that way.
*  His mother was prone to violent tantrums, beating him with belts, car antennas, and PVC
*  pipes.
*  Once when Wardlow was ten, she pulled a gun on him, after she caught him swiping money
*  from her purse.
*  She told me my father was an alien from another world, and that I would never find anyone
*  to love me but her.
*  He wrote in a letter to me.
*  I believed it.
*  In school he was a loner, though he did well in class and was good with electronics.
*  Other prisoners told me he earned a reputation for being able to fix anything.
*  When Wardlow was sixteen, he met Thanya Fulfer, a classmate in the high school library.
*  Like him, she had problems at home.
*  During senior year, they both dropped out of school and left town.
*  For long they were back in Cason, where on the morning of June 14, 1993, Wardlow knocked
*  on Carl Cole's door and asked to use the phone.
*  The young couple hoped to steal his car and flee to Montana, where they would start a new
*  life together.
*  But the plan went wrong, and Wardlow, who was eighteen at the time, shot the older man.
*  Afterward, he and Fulfer fled the state and Cole's pickup truck.
*  They were arrested two days later in South Dakota.
*  Wardlow was sentenced to death on February 11, 1995.
*  He arrived on death row two days later.
*  Unlike Ford, Wardlow never played Dungeons & Dragons before prison.
*  But months later, another man on the row handed him a book full of fantasy names and magical
*  creatures.
*  This is the game, Wardlow remembered him saying.
*  Be ready tomorrow.
*  For the next two decades, Wardlow went on to play dozens of games with many characters.
*  One he became known for among his death row peers was Arthax De Kenneth, a magical prodigy.
*  Though his home planet, the war torn Eberon, was an established setting among D&D players.
*  Arthax was Wardlow's creation.
*  A character he developed through pages and pages of game notes and hand drawn illustrations.
*  According to a professor and an inventor, Arthax had a twin sister who died as a baby.
*  After the girl's death, Arthax's mother refused to let the tragedy derail her academic career.
*  Instead, she threw herself into her work, leaving her son to be raised by tutors.
*  They gave him all the tools for magical greatness.
*  And after graduating early from a prestigious wizarding college, he got a job with a top
*  guild where he invented secret weapons for war.
*  Arthax could cast spells to control the elements, manipulate electricity, or send walls of fire
*  raging across enemy battlefields.
*  Every day, Arthax used his gifts to help the higher ups of House Kenneth perfect the
*  invention they hoped would end a century of war.
*  At night, he came home to his wife, his childhood sweetheart.
*  Arthax was, to some extent, a version of Wardlow whose mother was not shattered.
*  Whose parents loved him and sent him to a prestigious school.
*  Whose proficiency with electricity earned him a comfortable living.
*  Whose best options never included running away.
*  Whose worst mistake never landed him on death row.
*  Friends is a loaded word in prison.
*  Ford wrote to me in a long-type letter sent three years ago.
*  So many people have been betrayed by their friends.
*  What we have around us are more associates, close associates.
*  But D&D turned associates into a crew.
*  After they started playing together at Polonsky, Ford noticed that when Wardlow was in charge
*  of the game, the other guys didn't bicker as much.
*  As Dungeon Master, Wardlow created vast and intricate worlds.
*  He could play without books or hand-drawn maps and could run the game on the fly, improvising
*  the narrative as he went along.
*  Some D&D crews on death row liked to play at random times, diving into a fantasy world
*  whenever the mood struck.
*  But when Wardlow ran the games, he liked to set a schedule, usually starting around 9am
*  Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, sometimes playing until they fell asleep.
*  It was the rare activity Ford and his friends could look forward to, a time when no one
*  would talk about legal cases or lost appeals.
*  Sometimes, through their characters, they opened up about problems they would never otherwise
*  discuss.
*  Abusive parents, fractured childhoods, drug addictions, unpacking their personal traumas through a
*  thin veil of fantasy.
*  With Billy, D&D has become our therapy, Ford Road in 2019.
*  Death Row didn't offer any of the educational or mental health programs available in regular
*  prisons.
*  Rehabilitation isn't the goal for those on death row, and special programming is not always
*  logistically feasible for people held in solitary confinement.
*  For these players, the games served as their life skills course, anger management class,
*  and drug counseling too.
*  In 2005, the Supreme Court banned capital punishment for crimes committed by people under
*  18, saying that evolving standards of decency forbade it.
*  Though Texas had to stop executing minors, the state could still sentence older teenagers,
*  those who were 18 and 19 to death.
*  Some of the men in the D&D crew never had their own apartments or bank accounts, never
*  paid rent or bought car insurance or cash to pay check.
*  Once they got to prison, their lives were in essence, frozen.
*  Wardlow gave the men something to aspire to, not only because his games offered players
*  a sense of structure and purpose, but also because his legal case had the potential to
*  establish an important precedent.
*  Prisoners in Texas can be sentenced to death only if a jury decides they are guilty and
*  will pose a danger to society.
*  That controversial future danger finding has been part of Texas death penalty law since
*  the 1970s.
*  But brain science has evolved over the past half century.
*  An expert's question whether it's possible to make that determination with any accuracy,
*  if someone was just 18 or 19 at the time of a crime.
*  Research shows that the prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain associated with emotional
*  regulation and understanding consequences, keeps developing into a person's 20s.
*  Wardlow's legal team leaned on science in their court filings, arguing that an 18-year-olds
*  brain wasn't notably different from that of a 17-year-old.
*  When the men heard about the details of Wardlow's appeal, they began to feel hopeful.
*  You had a lot of guys that were really like, hey man, this is our shot.
*  This is our shot right here, Ford told me last year, peering through the scratched visiting
*  room glass.
*  The Supreme Court's going to do this.
*  In the meantime, D&D was their best chance to learn about the world.
*  They had to manage money to make sure they had enough gold to rent a tenement or buy
*  a horse.
*  And when they were running low, they had to consider the best path for getting more, finding
*  work at the local tavern, for example, or searching for treasure in a dungeon.
*  If they opted for the latter, they had to exercise caution and weigh the risks.
*  For time, their lives in the game world led to the sort of friendships solitary confinement
*  usually prevents.
*  From their respective wreck cages in the prison yard, Wardlow would offer Ford advice whenever
*  he was having problems with another prisoner.
*  Or Wardlow would get one of the general population prisoners who work as janitors to deliver
*  the jailhouse comfort food he made in his cell.
*  Sometimes they would test recipes, like the time they both made cool-aid flavored cheesecakes
*  with powdered creamer and shuttles samples back and forth.
*  They talked about game strategies and what to do when guards confiscated their playbooks
*  or moved them to different cells every few months.
*  And whenever Ford and Wardlow were housed near each other, they played D&D.
*  Some games were small, with only three or four players.
*  Others looped in more than a dozen men.
*  Most often Wardlow was the dungeon master, but sometimes Ford took on that role instead.
*  In 2013, Ford's mother died, and he quit the game.
*  But Wardlow kept talking to him, even when it was just a one-way conversation through
*  the wreck cage fence.
*  At first, Wardlow just mused a loud about whatever was on his mind, his voice calming and hypnotic.
*  As he kept talking, Ford started to open up to, crying as he recounted memories of his
*  mother.
*  He remembered the pride she took in her work as a police officer, and how much she taught
*  him about computers when she worked in an Atari warehouse years later.
*  He remembered how she showed him the basics of chess.
*  At one point, Wardlow sent over some jelly beans.
*  He knew Ford loved them, especially the black ones.
*  Next thing you know, I'm not crying when I'm talking about my mother.
*  Ford told me two years ago during one of our first in-person interviews.
*  I'm just talking about her.
*  A few weeks later, he jumped back in the game.
*  In late 2019, Wardlow was moved to a cell in the section known as Death Watch for the
*  men who have execution dates.
*  Wardlow had just received his April 29, 2020.
*  At first, he said he wasn't going to play D&D anymore.
*  The Ford started discussing how the players were facing a potentially world-ending threat.
*  Wardlow knew he had to join the game to save the story.
*  I'm in, Wardlow told him.
*  And so Arthax, his character, opened his eyes.
*  On a sunny morning in a lush area of Eberron, Arthax was hard at work on a new invention,
*  when a green fog swept in, rolling down from the palaces.
*  Arthax saw it coming and fired a spell, but the magic clashed with the mist, and his
*  spell came to life, attacking its creator.
*  Arthax fell unconscious.
*  When he woke up, he saw the face of a stranger covered with magical rooms.
*  Seven years had passed, and the world he knew was in ruins.
*  By that point, an evil moon called Atropus had begun orbiting the planet, bringing down
*  a foul rain that made the dead rise from their graves.
*  Even the animals that men killed for food came back to life before they could be eaten,
*  their flesh writhing and pulsing with a dark energy.
*  The gods had disappeared, locked away in an hourglass prison.
*  Without them, good magic no longer worked.
*  Arthax came up with a plan to defeat the moon and save the world, but victory came at
*  a heavy price.
*  Half the adventurers died, and the survivors soon realized they still needed to free the
*  gods.
*  To do that, Arthax cast a spell to turn himself into a more powerful being.
*  It was potentially a winning move, but it was risky too.
*  The being had a tendency to explode, especially if he suffered a serious blow.
*  No matter how powerful Arthax was, or how much his dungeon master wanted him to prevail
*  when the crew faced off against a horde of villains, the outcome came down to chance.
*  One of the things of D&D is that it's the role of the dice, Ford told me, leaning toward
*  the glass between us during one of my visits.
*  And if you make a role of the dice, and your dice role is too low to be able to save you,
*  he said, then, you know, you bite the bullet.
*  With a flick of the spinner, Arthax was gone.
*  The rest of the raiding party continued on, but without his help, they all died.
*  Afterward, some of the men decided to start over, but not Wardlow.
*  He knew he didn't have enough time.
*  The state canceled his April execution because of the pandemic, but set a new one for July
*  8th, 2020.
*  As the weeks crept along, and the execution date remained firm, Wardlow and Ford realized
*  they were trapped in a storyline, they were powerless to imagine their way out of.
*  You have this certain reality, Ford told me.
*  Not only are they telling you that one of your best friends that you consider your brother
*  is going to die on this particular day, but that you pretty much have nothing that you
*  can do about it.
*  In the spring of 2020, Wardlow decided to start one last game, a smaller, simpler campaign
*  that he created for a few of his friends, involving a mythical city, and a quest to save
*  a magic sword.
*  I'm sure you've seen those final episodes of your favorite shows, Wardlow wrote to me
*  in his last letter on June 24th, 2020, which he composed on his prison typewriter.
*  That's what this is like.
*  Although I hope this isn't the final episode.
*  Two weeks later, the state executed him.
*  After that day at the funeral home, Wardlow's girlfriend in the free world, a long-time penpal
*  and anti-death penalty activist, touched him for the first time, sobbing, and caressing
*  his face as he lay in his coffin.
*  She messaged me afterward to ask if I wanted his cardboard box of gaming supplies.
*  Inside, an aging piece of paper made me catch my breath.
*  It was a handwritten apology to Carl Cole's son, dated 1997.
*  Folded in half, it sat tucked among hundreds of pages of character sketches, game charts,
*  and hand drawn maps, the remnants of a fantasy world of wizards and orcs.
*  That letter was never mailed, Wardlow's lawyer said recently, but Wardlow wrote another
*  one to the Cole family that was sent after he was executed.
*  This Wardlow's death, Ward has had a harder time reading and doing the small things that
*  he wants enjoyed.
*  This place, it does something to you.
*  He told me during one of our visits.
*  Ward watched other friends and fellow players face execution dates, and he began to worry
*  about when the state would set his.
*  In the meantime, a team of lawyers asked him to be a lead plaintiff in a lawsuit aimed
*  at changing the isolating conditions of death row.
*  They filed the case this January, and it is still pending.
*  If they win, the man at Polonski might be able to play D&D together again, sitting around
*  the table for the first time in two decades.
*  Wardlow of course won't be there.
*  As long as we have D&D, Ward told me, we're keeping his legacy alive.
