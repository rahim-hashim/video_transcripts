*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernici, and this is the daily.
*  Since Benjamin Netanyahu's far right coalition took power late last year in Israel, violence
*  between Israelis and Palestinians has been escalating.
*  At the same time, there's another crisis taking hold.
*  We are right in the heart of Tel Aviv, and you can see thousands and thousands of protesters
*  here have just brought this city to an absolute standstill.
*  One that has sparked massive protests and divided Israelis deeply over a question that's
*  fundamental to Israel's democracy and to what kind of country it will become.
*  We're here to demonstrate for the democracy.
*  Without the democracy, there is no state of Israel.
*  Today, my colleague Patrick Kingsley on what is driving some of the biggest protests in
*  Israeli history and why this moment is so pivotal for the country's future.
*  It's Friday, March 10th.
*  So Patrick, I've been reading about what's been happening in Israel and from what it looks
*  like, we're really in a crisis moment here where the conflict isn't just between Israelis
*  and Palestinians, but actually among Jewish Israelis themselves.
*  Tell us what's going on.
*  Well, since the start of the year, we've had these two crises.
*  We've had a very painful violent start to the year where there's been a rise in violence
*  with his left more than 70 Palestinians dead and at least 14 Israelis dead.
*  But in parallel, inside Israel, there is something that's far rarer, which is a domestic
*  internal crisis between Jewish Israelis that has set off a wave of mass protests.
*  And these are protests that illustrate deep divisions between different groups in Israeli
*  society, religious, secular, different social classes.
*  And at the center of this dramatic battle is the Israeli judicial system and in particular
*  it's Supreme Court.
*  And Patrick, what is it in particular about the Supreme Court that is making it such a
*  lightning rod right now?
*  Fundamentally, this is a question about the future and nature of Israeli democracy itself
*  because the far right government that entered office here late last year, led by Benjamin
*  Netanyahu, wants to limit the court's influence.
*  And one large part of Israeli society believes that the court is too powerful and its influence
*  needs to be limited in order to ensure that elected lawmakers have more power and influence
*  than unelected judges on the Supreme Court.
*  And another large part of Israeli society completely disagrees and it says, no, we need
*  to protect the court, we need to protect the court's influence because the court is the
*  only check and balance on the power of the government of the day and without the court
*  we cannot ensure a balance of power between the different arms of government.
*  So this is a really fundamental fight that is playing out here, one that is in essence
*  about the soul of Israel.
*  Help us understand how things have gotten to this point.
*  So to understand it, I think we should go back about 30 years to the early 1990s.
*  Unlike the United States, Israel had never had a formal written constitution and still
*  doesn't.
*  But in the early 1990s, lawmakers began to try to create quasi-constitutional laws, something
*  akin to a bill of rights that set out certain personal human rights.
*  And in doing so, they basically opened the door for the Supreme Court to intervene when
*  future laws contravened those basic personal rights that were enshrined by the new legislation
*  in the 1990s.
*  So in other words, it set up a situation that when the parliament passed a law that potentially
*  infringed on rights of minorities or other rights, the court could come in and strike it
*  down.
*  Exactly.
*  And this was a big shift in the court's role in Israel.
*  And the judge that became most associated with this transition was the man who was the
*  chief justice of the court from the mid-90s until the mid-2000s, Aharam Burak.
*  And tell us about him.
*  Burak was born before the Second World War in Eastern Europe.
*  He survived the Holocaust.
*  He moved to Israel.
*  He gets a law degree.
*  He becomes a towering figure in the legal community.
*  He becomes an attorney general, a peace negotiator, briefly between Israel and Egypt.
*  And he eventually becomes head of the Supreme Court in 1995.
*  And while there are very many people involved in this judicial change in the 90s, he has
*  become the one person most associated with it because he's spoken often and written
*  often about the merits of judicial intervention in public life, sometimes called judicial activism.
*  According to my approach, judges in modern democracies have a major role to play in protecting
*  democracy.
*  He believes that the court system is an important check on the power of government.
*  And without judicial intervention, a government can become too powerful.
*  We judges of this generation are charged with watching over our basic values and protecting
*  them against those who challenge them.
*  He famously popularized the term constitutional revolution to describe the empowerment of
*  the Supreme Court.
*  We cannot take the continued existence of democracy for granted.
*  So how did that work in practice?
*  Well, in practice, at least initially, this new legal principle wasn't really used very
*  much.
*  But then this newly empowered court makes a few decisions that put it firmly in the cross
*  has a different parts of the Israeli bright.
*  And perhaps the best example of this was in 2012 when the Supreme Court moved to overturn
*  a law that gave ultra-orthodox Israeli Jews a deferment to Army service.
*  And it's important to remember that in Israel, military service is mandatory for most Jewish
*  Israeli citizens.
*  But ultra-orthodox Jews had basically been given an exception so that they could study Jewish
*  law.
*  And the court thought this shouldn't be the case that no group should be given special
*  favors.
*  And so they overturned the law.
*  Ultra-orthodox Jews felt that the court was trying to meddle in their way of life with
*  that decision.
*  But the key moment was in 2020 when the court makes a decision that angered another part
*  of the Israeli right, the settler movement.
*  The court scrutinized the law that was passed by Parliament that would have authorized settlements
*  in the West Bank that had been built without a government permission on private Palestinian
*  land.
*  The court decided to overturn the law.
*  It said that the law infringed on the property rights of the Palestinians.
*  And in the process, the settler movement felt that the court was interfering in their
*  political aspirations of settling on more and more of the West Bank.
*  So basically, it sounds like this frustration that the far right and ultra-orthodox in
*  Israeli society had at the decisions the court was making was mounting over time.
*  As the court intervened in each of these decisions that were really about core issues
*  in Israeli society.
*  Absolutely.
*  And on top of that, there were other instances where the court made huge decisions that
*  though it wasn't necessarily overruling Parliament was nevertheless, again and again, angering
*  the Israeli right.
*  And there's one decision from the mid-2000s that really hangs over all of this.
*  The Israeli government decided in 2005 to withdraw from the Gaza Strip and get rid of all
*  the settlements in the strip that have been established since Israel occupied Gaza in
*  1967.
*  And the court backed that decision.
*  It was an enormously emotional moment, an enormously emotional decision for Israel and for Israelis.
*  Some people saw this as a vital step towards making peace with the Palestinians and others
*  saw it as the uprooting of thousands of Israelis from their homes.
*  And to this day, it's a decision that is still raised by people on the Israeli right, in
*  particular the people that want the Supreme Court to be undermined.
*  As part of their broader argument that the court is doing and has done the bidding of the
*  left.
*  And I mean, is that a fair assessment given all these decisions?
*  Well, in reality, things are more complex.
*  For a start, while the court has taken decisions that have gone against certain particularly ambitious
*  goals of the settler movement, the court has been broadly supportive of the settlement
*  enterprise.
*  There are even judges today who live in settlements in the West Bank.
*  But nevertheless, it has also taken decisions that in some cases have favored Palestinians,
*  favored minorities.
*  And the strong perception remains among the far right.
*  This is a left-wing court that is blocking the will of the Israeli majority.
*  And in the process of all that.
*  So it's a strong point of the way of the right.
*  The way of the right is the way of the right.
*  Political leaders of parties on the right took up this frustration as a political cause.
*  I think that the Supreme Court took power without authority authority and that is too much
*  activist.
*  They have long said that something needs to be done, that some of the Supreme Court's
*  power needs to be taken away.
*  And we're committed to solve the issue of traditional activism at large and at large.
*  But for many years, they didn't really have any means of doing that because they never
*  had enough seats in parliament to have full control over parliament.
*  And so they had to compromise.
*  And these designs that they had on the Supreme Court never materialized.
*  And then late last year, that all changed.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Patrick, you said before the break that late last year, the far right got their chance
*  to change things with the court.
*  And of course, the one thing I know about late last year in Israel, mainly from you because
*  we did a show about it, was that there was a big, very important election.
*  How did that affect what the right wanted to do with the court?
*  Well, as we discussed the last time we chatted on this show, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's
*  longest serving Prime Minister, was on the ropes last year.
*  He was facing a corruption trial.
*  He's still on trial for corruption.
*  And because of that trial, he had been rejected by many of his previous, more moderate
*  coalition partners.
*  And so to re-enter power, he strikes a deal with a bunch of far right parties in order to
*  form a majority coalition in the Israeli parliament, which puts him in an interesting spot.
*  In the past, he was a supporter of the Supreme Court's independence.
*  He even gave this big speech backing the court and its role in 2012.
*  And spoke about how great it was to have this balance between a super-in-court and parliament.
*  And that's the reason I'm here today.
*  Every time I go, I feel like I'm going to be a great leader in the country.
*  And in previous governments, he had kept up bay any demands from right wing colleagues
*  to overhaul the court because he would always create coalitions with parties from both
*  his left and his right.
*  Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may be about to pull off a political comeback
*  and get his old job back.
*  But this time was different.
*  Mr Netanyahu is in a position to lead a religious and right wing majority coalition.
*  This time, his hands were more tied because this coalition is Israel's most right wing
*  government ever.
*  He's actually one of the most left wing members of that government.
*  And what that means is that these far right parties and even right wing members of his own
*  party have been able to push this coal that they've always wanted to achieve.
*  Israel's new government has unveiled a plan to overhaul the judicial system and weaken
*  the powers of the Supreme Court.
*  So they're in power.
*  They have a green light effectively to do this thing that they've wanted to do for a long
*  time and they push on the gas.
*  What is in the plan?
*  There's quite a few technical things in the plan, but there are two central points.
*  The first point is that the government wants to give itself control over who gets to
*  be a judge, who gets appointed to the Supreme Court.
*  They want to avoid more aharam barracks to put it simply.
*  The second central point is they want to limit the influence that the Supreme Court can
*  have over parliament.
*  They want to give parliament the ability to override the court's decisions and they want
*  to reduce the instances where the court can override parliamentary decisions.
*  So they want to avoid another repeat of the 2020 ruling that the Supreme Court made about
*  settlements.
*  And what was the reaction to this?
*  It was furious.
*  Aharam barrack, the chief justice whom we mentioned earlier, who's been retired for a while,
*  but has remained a figure in public life, he weighed in on these proposals shortly after
*  they were first announced.
*  And he said that they were a string of poison pills.
*  They were the mass protests, as we mentioned.
*  There are the mass protests.
*  But also pressure has been steadily rising from all corners of Israeli life.
*  Some of the most successful names in Israeli tech, such as Verbit and Disruptive, are now
*  threatening to move elsewhere.
*  We saw tech leaders, businessmen, saying they were either going to pull out their money
*  or going ahead and doing so.
*  They believe that the reform threatens the country's business-friendly environment by weakening
*  the legal system.
*  And just a few days ago.
*  Now protests are emerging even within the nation's military.
*  We also had military reservists who play a crucial role in Israeli military operational
*  capacity.
*  Hold a private meeting with senior commanders, expressing amplitant about serving if the
*  court overhaul goes through.
*  And as you said earlier, some of what's worrying is really here is the idea that the court
*  would no longer serve as a check on the government.
*  I get why that's a concern.
*  But what in particular are Israelis worried might happen?
*  They worried quite a few things.
*  One of them is the fear that Mr. Netanyahu, who is on track for corruption, as we mentioned,
*  might somehow take advantage of a muted Supreme Court to subsequently push through legislation
*  that might help him either escape punishment or end his trial altogether.
*  Now he denies that, but that is the fear of his opponents.
*  And his opponents also fear for what these judicial changes would do to Israel at large.
*  What kind of government and what kind of country would result if this overhaul was enacted
*  in full?
*  And in the longer term, I think there's a demographic concern here.
*  We put the religious part of the population, which tends to lean right wing, is going
*  faster, is having more babies, than the secular part, which leans to the left.
*  And there's a fear that with a majority in the population, the right leaning section
*  of society would have a lock on parliament.
*  And without an independent judicial system, without an independent Supreme Court, the parliament
*  would be able to trample on the rights of minorities, on secular Jews, on people who for
*  years have been the mainstream of Jewish society, but in 30, 40, 50 years might no longer
*  be so.
*  Right.
*  And caveat is that the people protesting against this overhaul are not monolithic.
*  They do include people from religious backgrounds.
*  They do include people from right wing backgrounds.
*  Nevertheless, I think it's fair to say that a significant part, maybe the majority of
*  the people who are protesting are those who feel that they would be left out in this more
*  religious, more conservative, new Israel that has been emerging over the last few years,
*  and due to demographic trends, feels like we'll become more entrenched in the coming decades.
*  Patrick, on top of all of this unrest, you have also been writing about clashes between
*  the Israeli military and Palestinians in the West Bank.
*  There's been this pretty steep death toll, as you noted in the beginning of our conversation
*  over the past couple of months.
*  Is there a connection here?
*  Well, on the surface, these feel like two different crises, and at a first glance, they might
*  not seem connected, but actually there is a common threat.
*  In the West Bank, we see growing activity by Palestinian armed groups and growing number
*  of raids by the Israeli army.
*  We see more attacks by Palestinian government on Israeli civilians.
*  And we also see rising violence by extremist settlers, including arson attacks on homes
*  and cars two weekends ago.
*  And the connection between these two crises is this, that some of the people who are driving
*  some of the unrest in the West Bank were also simultaneously driving the judicial changes.
*  The first of the arson attacks that I just mentioned, the far right finance minister,
*  Betsellel Smotrich, said that he wanted the town that was attacked in those arson attacks
*  to be wiped out, to be erased.
*  And he said that it was the state that should be doing that.
*  He later walked back some of those comments, but he said them in the first place.
*  He's also one of the same guys who for years has been pushing for the undermining of the Supreme Court.
*  He's one of the lawmakers that was behind that legislation that the Supreme Court struck down
*  in 2020 that would have favored settlers in the West Bank.
*  And so he's an example, firstly, of how some of the same people creating a more combustible
*  dynamic in the occupied West Bank are also some of the same people who are driving these
*  judicial changes.
*  And he's also an example of why some of these folks want to neuter the Supreme Court.
*  They want to do so in order to build more settlements, more easily, in more places in the
*  West Bank.
*  They want to have fewer limits from the Israeli judiciary, from the Israeli Supreme Court
*  on that activity.
*  Right.
*  This is precisely something that the court presumably would have stopped.
*  And now, you know, the people who were involved in calls to violence like this are actually
*  in the state running the state and want the state to be unfettered, if you will.
*  That's more or less it.
*  And actually, these comments are part of what is driving the concerns from military
*  reservists that I mentioned earlier during those private meetings with military commanders.
*  Reservists raise the concern that without a strong Supreme Court, someone like Betsellel
*  Smotridge might be able to order the army to carry out illegal operations or immoral operations.
*  And it's comments like the one he made last week about wiping out a Palestinian town
*  that are driving some of those fears about the knock on effects of neutering the Supreme
*  Court.
*  So the issue of court reform is existential to many Israelis, kind of for two reasons.
*  Like you said, it's about the future of Israeli democracy.
*  And that's really at stake as many people see it.
*  And also, it just raises pretty urgent questions about, you know, what it would mean to take
*  this guardrail away in a region that's already very inflamed.
*  Yes.
*  And people are worried.
*  Polling from February suggested that more than a third of Israelis fear that this whole
*  crisis could eventually erupt into a civil war.
*  Civil war?
*  Is that a possibility?
*  Certainly what people are talking about.
*  You read about it in the newspaper.
*  You see it in polling.
*  It may very well be hyperbole and the reactions of people who are feeling simply very emotional
*  about the difficult moment in the country's history.
*  But whether or not it actually gets to that point and obviously everyone hopes it doesn't.
*  But the fact it's even being discussed and written about in a semi-serious way illustrates
*  the emotion of the moment.
*  Patrick, where is all this leading?
*  Well, there are still several parliamentary hurdles that have to be cleared in order for
*  this overhaul to be enacted.
*  And certainly at the moment Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition has the numbers to pass these
*  proposals to put them into law.
*  But it's starting to feel like the situation is spiraling out of control.
*  And there's a sense that even among the government supporters that something needs to give.
*  So it could very well be that we see some sort of compromise in the coming weeks.
*  And if we don't, the situation could spiral even further.
*  Or decades Israel has projected itself as the only democracy in the Middle East.
*  And that determination has always been contested by Palestinians who say you can't have democracy
*  when you're occupying the West Bank.
*  But now even Israelis are wondering about whether that claim of being a shining democracy
*  is under threat.
*  And the next few months will be a decisive factor in that debate.
*  Patrick, thank you.
*  Thank you Sabrina for having me on.
*  On Thursday, Israel's mainly ceremonial president Isaac Herzog took an unusually strong stance
*  against the overhaul.
*  He said that the proposal, as it is currently drafted, quote, undermines the foundations of democracy
*  and needs to disappear from this world and soon.
*  Netanyahu, for his part, said he was open to dialogue but did not say that he would give
*  up on the overhaul.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  Folks, let me try to rely on you with the budget I'm releasing today.
*  President Joe Biden proposed a budget on Thursday, the third of his presidency, a $6.8 trillion
*  plan that would increase spending on the military and a broad range of new social programs
*  while also reducing future budget deficits.
*  Republican control of the House ensures that the full blueprint has no chance of becoming
*  law, but the plan sets the stakes for a bigger fight over raising the federal debt limit
*  and the nation's fiscal trajectory.
*  It also serves as a kind of campaign preview for Biden's expected 2024 reelection bid.
*  And the Times reports that the Manhattan District Attorney's Office has signaled to Donald
*  Trump's lawyers that Trump could face criminal charges for his role in the payment of hush
*  money to a porn star.
*  Prosecutors offered Trump the chance to testify next week before a grand jury.
*  Such offers almost always indicate that an indictment is close.
*  Any case would mark the first time a former American president is indicted and could
*  upend the 2024 race in which Trump remains a leading contender.
