# The Sunday Read: ‘Spirited Away to Miyazaki Land’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 19, 2023](https://rr3---sn-ab5sznzd.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?expire=1711162704&ei=8PD9ZefULoGJ_9EPhsu_oAs&ip=128.59.177.129&id=o-ABJgVF9tyszL4PunE_oIv32m9gu1r7KOa-eaw57YDZwv&itag=139&source=youtube&requiressl=yes&xpc=EgVo2aDSNQ%3D%3D&mh=4Q&mm=31%2C29&mn=sn-ab5sznzd%2Csn-ab5l6nk6&ms=au%2Crdu&mv=m&mvi=3&pl=16&initcwndbps=1530000&vprv=1&mime=audio%2Fmp4&gir=yes&clen=20042379&dur=3286.609&lmt=1679220859387576&mt=1711140780&fvip=2&keepalive=yes&c=ANDROID_EMBEDDED_PLAYER&txp=6218224&sparams=expire%2Cei%2Cip%2Cid%2Citag%2Csource%2Crequiressl%2Cxpc%2Cvprv%2Cmime%2Cgir%2Cclen%2Cdur%2Clmt&sig=AJfQdSswRgIhAICIUw33Io-9xASzFk3gRF1ciO7oR2_5_kYlbmmT92SyAiEAsb5eV47cBpMedJ4ndFkgSHhHN6hLBA51w2I3o-e7CDM%3D&lsparams=mh%2Cmm%2Cmn%2Cms%2Cmv%2Cmvi%2Cpl%2Cinitcwndbps&lsig=ALClDIEwRQIgWct_8G3D5Wp1vTvJQRhL_P7nYi2XESbjvvYNEFwbvboCIQDExno3vS4BwHKUmBKPzZ3E6Ur_nvl1vr-_k2KRl8XlVg%3D%3D)
*  I grew up going to what I think of as very American theme parks.
*  Roller coasters everywhere, bright lights, carnival games, overpriced food, entertainment
*  literally in every direction you look.
*  I guess I always just think of it as this big festival of capitalism.
*  And that felt very natural to me and I just assumed that every place in the world was like
*  that.
*  So when I went to this new theme park in Japan, it really flipped all those expectations
*  upside down.
*  Hi, my name is Sam Anderson and I'm a staff writer for the New York Times magazine.
*  For this week's Sunday read, I'll be reading my article for the February 19th, 2023 issue
*  of the magazine about a trip I took to a new Japanese theme park.
*  It's called Ghibli Park.
*  It's a long awaited celebration of the legendary animation of Studio Ghibli, which is run by
*  Hiami Azaki and some others.
*  I've been imagining this theme park for a long time as I've been watching these films and
*  I have to say, I always expected it to be strange, but it was much stranger than I ever
*  could have imagined.
*  So here's my article from the February 19th, 2023 issue of the New York Times magazine.
*  As an American, I know what it feels like to arrive at a theme park.
*  The totalizing consumerist embrace.
*  The blunt force, world warping, escapist delight.
*  I have known theme parks with entrance gates like international borders and ticket prices
*  like mortgage payments and parking lots the size of Cleveland.
*  I've been to Disney World, an alternate reality that basically occupies its own tax zone
*  with its own fire department and its own agriculture.
*  A place where before you even entered, you see a 100-foot tall electrical pole along
*  the freeway with Mickey Mouse ears.
*  This is a theme park's job to swallow the universe.
*  To replace our boring, aimless, frustrating world with a new one made just for us.
*  Imagine my confusion then when I arrived at Ghibli Park.
*  Japan's long-awaited tribute to the legendary animation of Studio Ghibli.
*  Like filmgoers all over the world, I had been fantasizing about a visit to Ghibli Park
*  since the project was announced more than five years ago.
*  I tracked the online rumors, inhaled the concept drawings, scrutinized the maps.
*  Ghibli's animation has always felt destined to be turned into a theme park.
*  Hiomiazaki, the studio's co-founder, is one of the all-time great imaginary world builders.
*  Right up there with Lewis Carroll, Jim Henson, Ursula K. Le Guin, Charles Schultz, Maurice
*  Sendak, and composers of the Icelandic sagas.
*  Even Miyazaki's most fantastical creations, a castle with giant metal chicken legs, a
*  yellow bus with the body of a cat, feels somehow thick and plausible and real.
*  Miyazaki started Studio Ghibli in 1985 out of desperation.
*  When he and his co-founders, Isau Takahata and Toshio Suzuki couldn't find a studio
*  willing to put out their work.
*  The films were brilliant, but notoriously artsy, expensive, labor intensive.
*  Miyazaki is maniacally detailed obsessed.
*  He agonizes over his children's cartoons as if he were Michelangelo painting the
*  Sistine Chapel.
*  He will pour whole oceans of effort and time and money into the smallest effects, the
*  way a jumping fish twists as it leaps.
*  Little faces in a crowd reacting to an earthquake, the physics of tiles during a rooftop chase
*  scene.
*  Miyazaki insists that although few viewers will be conscious of all this work, every viewer
*  will feel it, and we do.
*  Those tiny touches, adding up across the length of a film, anchor his fantasies in the actual
*  world.
*  Ghibli is an Italian word derived from Arabic for a hot wind that blows across Libya.
*  The plan was for the company to blow like a hot wind through the stagnant world of animation.
*  It succeeded.
*  For more than 35 years, Studio Ghibli has been the great eccentric juggernaut of anime,
*  thinking out classic after odd classic.
*  Castle in the Sky in 1986.
*  My neighbor Totoro in 1988, Kiki's delivery service in 1989, only yesterday, 1991, Princess
*  Mononoke in 1997, spirited away in 2001.
*  In Japan, the release of a new Ghibli film is a national event, and the studio's most
*  popular characters are ubiquitous, plump Totoro, mysterious no-face, the grinning cat bus,
*  Google-eyed Sutsprites.
*  As a kind of shorthand, Miyazaki is often called the Walt Disney of Japan.
*  I was dying to see, in person, how a jibli theme park might work.
*  How could these surreal worlds possibly be translated into reality?
*  What would it feel like to lose ourselves inside them?
*  In November, when Ghibli Park finally opened, I made sure to get myself there.
*  And so, after many years and much traveling, at long last, I found myself stepping into
*  the wonders of Ghibli Park.
*  Or did I?
*  Did I find myself stepping into the wonders of Ghibli Park?
*  My first impression was not awe or majesty or surrender or consumerist bliss.
*  It was confusion.
*  For a surprisingly long time after I arrived, I could not tell whether or not I had arrived.
*  There was no security checkpoint, no ticket booths, no ambient Ghibli soundtrack, no
*  mountainous cat bus statue.
*  Instead, I found myself stepping out of a very ordinary train station into what seemed
*  to be a large municipal park, a sea of pavement, sports fields, vending machines.
*  It looked like the kind of place you might go on a lazy weekend to see a pretty good soft
*  ball tournament.
*  There were some buildings around, but it was hard to tell which of them might or might
*  not be Ghibli related.
*  In the distance, the arc of a ferris wheel broke the horizon.
*  But this, I would discover, had nothing to do with Ghibli Park.
*  I wandered into and out of a convenience store.
*  I saw some children wearing Totoro hats and started to follow them.
*  It felt like some kind of bizarre treasure hunt.
*  A theme park where the theme was searching for the theme park, which was, in a way, perfectly
*  studio Ghibli.
*  No pleasure without a little challenge.
*  And so I headed down the hill, trying to find my way in.
*  Like many non-Japanese viewers, I first encountered Studio Ghibli through the 2001 film Spirit
*  It Away.
*  It is Miyazaki's masterpiece, a popular and critical super triumph that won the Oscar for best animated
*  feature and became for two decades the highest grossing film in Japanese history.
*  Critics all over the world simultaneously fell out of their armchairs to praise it in
*  the most ecstatic possible terms.
*  Nigel Andrews of the Financial Times rated it six out of five stars.
*  Justifying this mathematical impossibility, exception must be made for the exceptional,
*  he wrote, with a flood of rapturous beat poetry.
*  Note, what is the film about?
*  It is about 122 minutes and 12 billion years.
*  It sums up all existence and gives us a mythology good for every society, a meable, animal
*  or human that ever lived.
*  And he offered the ultimate existentialist blurb.
*  Rush now while life lasts.
*  I, on the other hand, am not a film critic.
*  I am an ordinary American.
*  Someone raised on MTV and SNL and CGI, which means that my entertainment metabolism has
*  been carefully tuned to digest the purest visual corn syrup.
*  Sarcastic men with large guns.
*  Earning princesses with grumpy fathers.
*  Explosive explosions, explosively exploding.
*  When I watched Spirit It Away, at first I had no idea what I was looking at.
*  In the simplest terms, the film tells the coming of age story of a ten-year-old girl named
*  Chihiro.
*  It takes place in a haunted theme park, where almost immediately Chihiro's parents are
*  turned into pigs.
*  And Chihiro is forced to sign away her name and perform menial labor in a bathhouse for
*  ghosts.
*  Most spirits, monsters, gods, it's hard to know exactly what to call them, and the film
*  never explains.
*  A full plot summary would be impossible.
*  The story moves at a strange tumbling pace, with elements connecting and separating and
*  floating around, revolving and recombining as if in a dream.
*  But plot isn't really the point.
*  The majestic thing about Spirit It Away is the world itself.
*  Miyazaki's creativity is radically dense.
*  Every little molecule of the film seems charged with invention.
*  The haunted bathhouse attracts a proliferation of very weird beings.
*  Giant yellow ducklings, a sentient slime blob, fanged monsters with antlers, a humanoid
*  radish spirit, who appears to be wearing an upside down red bowl for a hat.
*  There is a trio of green, disembodied heads, with black moustaches and angry faces, who
*  bounce around and pile up on top of one another, and grunt disapprovingly at Chihiro.
*  There are so many creatures stuffed into so many nooks and crannies that it seems as if
*  Miyazaki has been spending multiple eternities on multiple planets, running parallel evolutionary
*  timelines, just so he can sketch the most interesting results.
*  As a viewer, you have to surrender to the abundance, crowd-surf into the hallucination.
*  Miyazaki knows that his work can be difficult, and he is at all times, righteously, defiant.
*  I must say that I hate Disney's works, he once declared.
*  The barrier to both the entry and exit of Disney films is too low and too wide.
*  To me, they show nothing but contempt for the audience.
*  At home Miyazaki is a celebrity, recognizable to the point of parody, catapillar eyebrows,
*  heavy dark rimmed glasses, sculpted white beard, cigarette.
*  In 2019, the TV network NHK, Japan's rough equivalent to the BBC, aired a four-part documentary
*  chronically Miyazaki's creative process.
*  It is a festival of grouchy agony, full of insults.
*  He's not an adult yet, he says of his then 39-year-old son, Goro.
*  In self-reproach, I feel like a comb with missing teeth, he says.
*  Miyazaki is the Kermudgeon's Kermudgeon.
*  Over the decades, he has dismissed everything from iPads, disgusting, to 1980s Japanese
*  animation, resembles the food served on jumbo jet airliners, to art created by artificial
*  intelligence.
*  I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself.
*  Many artists have high standards, Miyazakis are in outer space.
*  Disney is famously a vast corporate content farm, with all artistic choices carefully examined
*  by an assembly line of executives, marketers, focus groups, etc.
*  Whereas Miyazakis' vision is absolutely his own.
*  Despite its global success, Studio Ghibli has remained quirky and unpredictable, a direct
*  reflection of the personalities of its founders.
*  To this day, Miyazaki insists on meticulously hand drawing his own storyboards.
*  When his sketches go to Ghibli's larger team for the technical work of animation, he checks
*  every image.
*  And if you see something he dislikes, he will erase it and draw right over it, explaining
*  the whole time why it was wrong.
*  For as long as he possibly could, Miyazaki resisted computer animation.
*  He still refuses on principle to make sequels.
*  His long-told parents that children should not watch his films more than once a year.
*  Whatever experiences we provide them, Miyazaki has said are in a sense stealing time from
*  them that otherwise might be spent in a world where they go out and make their own discoveries
*  or have their own personal experiences.
*  Miyazaki is now 82.
*  Miyaz tried multiple times without success to pass the creative torch.
*  I trained successors but I couldn't let go, he once said, I devoured them, I devoured
*  their talent, that was my destiny, I ate them all.
*  Even his elder son, Goro, has tried his hand at directing with mixed results.
*  Miyazaki has abruptly retired and then just as suddenly unretired by my count four times.
*  He is currently finishing work on a new film titled How Do You Live?
*  It is now in production and should be out in Japan this summer.
*  All of which raises some huge questions for Studio Ghibli.
*  Questions so deep they're practically theological.
*  What will happen to the company when the great Miyazaki is gone?
*  In such idiosyncratic imaginative worlds outlive the mind that made them?
*  Would a theme park help as it did for Walt Disney to answer both of those questions?
*  Spirited away is now more than 20 years old.
*  Since that first confused encounter I have watched it many, many times.
*  I still find it strange and scary and disorienting, but also uplifting.
*  Despite his crankiness Miyazaki has always defined his artistic mission in inspirational
*  terms.
*  I want to send a message of cheer to all those wandering aimlessly through life he has
*  written.
*  So, when the real world gets bad, when I feel depressed, stressed, misanthropic, crushed
*  by politics or deadlines, I often find myself stepping once more into Chihiro's world.
*  I find myself wanting to float around in Miyazaki's imagination, as the spirits float in
*  the herbal pools of the spirited away bathhouse.
*  I want to snuggle into the world of Chihibli like Totoro snuggling into a bed of ferns.
*  Do you recognize this?
*  One of my Chihibli park guides asked me.
*  I did, of course I did.
*  We were staring at a big old-fashioned Japanese gate, red, with dark brown wood and a green
*  tile roof.
*  It was a structure straight out of spirited away.
*  Waiting on the other side, framed perfectly in the doorway, was one of my favorite things
*  in all of Miyazaki, a squat stone statue, inscrutable and smiling.
*  My guides were two friendly members of Chihibli's PR team, Mai Sato and Sekowong.
*  I met them up at the train station after I finished puttering around the area lost.
*  They confirmed that yes, I'd come to the right place.
*  Unlike any theme park I'd ever been to, Chihibli Park was located inside a larger park,
*  Expo 2005 Aichi commemorative park.
*  Even like a very polite house guest, it had tucked itself in without making much of a
*  fuss.
*  Its signage was subtle, and its attractions were spread around at great distances from
*  one another.
*  The guides told me that our tour would take approximately four hours.
*  As my body passed through the spirited away gate, I felt a slight shimmering thrill.
*  That smiling statue on the other side was a spirit shrine, guardian of the other world.
*  The first real sign in the film that Chihiro's life is about to be transformed.
*  As we approached, I wanted to stop and take a selfie and text it to everyone I know.
*  But other tourists were doing that, and more people over to the side were waiting politely
*  for their turn.
*  So the guides and I walked on.
*  This is when we entered the forest.
*  If you want Miyazaki to love you, it might help to be a tree.
*  He has a well-documented reverence for nature.
*  Rivers and mountains and oceans are practically the heroes of many Aichi-Bli films.
*  Miyazaki's forests are so distinctive that certain mossy shades of green automatically
*  make me think of them.
*  In fact Miyazaki often compares storytelling itself to a tree.
*  It's not just about flashy ornamentation, he likes to say.
*  It's about the deep invisible roots that support the trunk, that supports the branches, all
*  of which, in the end, allows you to hang the ornaments that everyone will admire.
*  Chibli Park was designed, as the official website puts it, in close consultation with
*  the surrounding forest.
*  My guide told me that, amazingly, not a single tree was cut down.
*  Again, I thought of Disney World, which was created at the expense of whole ecosystems,
*  square miles, denatured and paved, to make way for lucrative, user-friendly worlds of
*  plastic and metal.
*  Chibli Park, by contrast, is largely unchanged forest.
*  Many of its attractions involves walking endlessly through wooded paths.
*  Some of those paths are new or recently improved, but many seem old.
*  The forest's trees were thin and twisty.
*  They stretched over our heads like sunlit hallways.
*  They tangled off into the distance.
*  They just stood there, being trees.
*  Aircases, wooden and stone, branched off up and down hills.
*  Without my guides, I would have had no idea where to go.
*  As we walked, the American and me kept wondering about lawsuits.
*  Surely someone would someday trip on a route and fall down a staircase.
*  And wouldn't that person blame Chibli Park?
*  On one point we saw a warning sign attached to a post, telling people to beware of snakes
*  and hornets.
*  It listed a phone number to call if you got into trouble.
*  Months before, in my first meeting with Studio Ghibli's PR team about a possible visit,
*  I was told that the studio would be happy to work with me, but had one serious concern.
*  If the New York Times published an article about Chibli Park, they said, it might make
*  more people want to come visit.
*  This struck them as a problem.
*  Like many Chibli products, Chibli Park is impishly non-user friendly.
*  This is true for people in Japan and even more so for international visitors.
*  Consider for instance, its location.
*  Unlike Tokyo Disneyland or Universal Studios Japan in Osaka, Chibli Park is not located
*  in a tourist hub.
*  Instead, it sits on the outskirts of an unglamorous city called Nagoya, in a region famous for
*  being the home of Toyota, basically the Detroit of Japan.
*  And the park is not even in Nagoya proper.
*  From my hotel in the center of the city, it took me an hour and three different trains
*  to reach Chibli Park.
*  The website suggests taking the train because the park has no dedicated parking lot.
*  The website also does its best to lower expectations.
*  Declaring immediately, there are no big attractions or rides in Chibli Park.
*  The surrounding grounds are public and free to walk around all day long.
*  There are only three paid areas in Chibli Park, and by theme park standards, the admission
*  fees are laughably low, the equivalent of about $10 to $20 for each area.
*  The tickets at that time were nearly impossible to get.
*  There was a lottery system, and they were sold out for months in advance.
*  Occasionally, my guides would lead me to a modest little statue.
*  Do you recognize this?
*  They would ask.
*  And it would be something from a Chibli film, sitting on a bench, May's hat, and ear of
*  corn from my neighbor, Totoro.
*  Standing near a tree, a tanuki from Pompoko.
*  On a table, Susuke's bucket from Pongyo.
*  There are 15 of these objects they told me scattered throughout the park.
*  A little fan service scavenger hunt.
*  I would pause, identify the item, and take a photo.
*  Other tourists would stop and do the same.
*  And then we would all keep walking through the trees.
*  After a while, I told my guides, only half joking, that Chibli Park seemed like an extremely
*  elaborate way to lure people out into the middle of an obscure Japanese forest.
*  Yes, they said.
*  That is basically correct.
*  Studio Chibli did not offer me an interview with Hayami Azaki.
*  He was busy with his final film, and he almost never agrees to do interviews anymore.
*  Besides, they said, Chibli Park was not really his project.
*  The man in charge was Goro, Hayami Azaki's son.
*  In person, Goro Miyazaki is almost the opposite of his father.
*  Miyazaki the elder is a spectacle, perpetually in motion, smoking and agonizing and clutching
*  his hair.
*  He looks like a Miyazaki character.
*  Goro, by contrast, looks like an absolutely normal man.
*  He is 56, clean shaven, slim.
*  He sits still, and speaks softly, modestly, with none of his father's bombast.
*  His eyes are like deep pools.
*  Goro and I met at Chibli headquarters, a leafy compound designed by Hayami Azaki himself,
*  and he has spread over several blocks of a quiet Tokyo suburb.
*  We sat in a meeting room featuring shells of animation books and statuettes of Chibli
*  characters.
*  Goro arrived carrying multiple large folders, his sketches and plans for Chibli Park.
*  The Miyazakis, father and son, have what you might call a fraught relationship.
*  Most men have been surprisingly open about this.
*  During Goro's childhood, the great animator was mostly absent, cranking out masterpieces.
*  The little boy got to know his father, like the rest of Japan, by watching his films.
*  I just wanted him to be there, Goro says in the NHK documentary with great feeling.
*  He feels alive only when he's making a film.
*  And then he adds, resigned.
*  He can't change now.
*  I owe that little boy an apology, Hayami Azaki says.
*  Goro, meanwhile, was raised by his mother, Akimi Miyazaki.
*  She taught him to love the outdoors.
*  They were always going hiking, and they spent summers up in her father's mountain cabin.
*  In high school, Goro joined the mountaineering club.
*  In college, he studied forestry.
*  After graduation, he worked in landscape architecture.
*  In his 30s, Goro led the construction of a quirky little jibli museum in suburban Tokyo,
*  designed by his father, which opened in 2001.
*  This is something father and son could share, a reverence for nature.
*  And Goro brought this reverence to his design for Ghibli Park.
*  There was a time when we considered making our own version of Disneyland, he told me,
*  here's the Totoro area, people can ride the cat bus.
*  That's great.
*  But what about the environment around it?
*  After all, the action of my neighbor Totoro is inseparable from its natural setting,
*  fictrees, grass fields, rice patties.
*  Totoro drops acorns everywhere as a kind of calling card.
*  To love Totoro is to love not just a single creature, but a whole habitat.
*  It doesn't feel right to have that kind of idyllic landscape in a theme park, Goro continued.
*  You can't have a rice field that's green all year round.
*  What about plastic, I asked?
*  A plastic rice field contradicts the whole idea of Totoro's world, he said.
*  In Tokyo, I went to see Toshio Suzuki, the Yen to Miyazaki's Yang, the most important person
*  in the company's history, aside from Miyazaki and Takahata.
*  Although he has held many titles, producer, president, most crucially, Suzuki is functioned
*  as a kind of Miyazaki whisperer, a combination of friend, critic, right hand man, creative
*  consultant, collaborator, and business partner.
*  When Miyazaki strains a major deadline, or decides out of nowhere to retire, or when
*  he can't decide how to end a film, Suzuki is the one who figures out how to make it all
*  okay, to stretch budgets and schedules, to hire or lay off whole teams of people.
*  I met Suzuki at his office, the doorway of which features a Totoro welcome mat.
*  We sat together at a long table, speaking through an interpreter.
*  While Miyazaki is famously grouchy, Suzuki is open and affable.
*  He is a deep, hearty, easy laugh.
*  He loves to talk, so much so that he hosts his own weekly radio show.
*  Suzuki told me that the story of Jibli Park began almost by accident, 20 years ago, with
*  a quirky, one-off project.
*  It was Suzuki's idea.
*  For years, he had been fantasizing about building a real world, simulacrum, of the cartoon
*  house from my neighbor Totoro.
*  This was partly nostalgia.
*  Suzuki actually grew up in Nagoya, in a house like that, an old-style Japanese country
*  house with traditional woodworking.
*  Finally, the real world gave him a perfect excuse.
*  He learned that in 2005, a big world expo would be held in this municipal park on the
*  edge of Nagoya.
*  Its organizers were inviting companies from around the world, including Jibli, to create
*  pavilions.
*  And so Suzuki said, yes, we will build this house.
*  The expo organizers loved the idea.
*  Maybe you could put a Totoro in the house, they said, or some of those cute little sit-sprites.
*  No, Suzuki said.
*  In our interview, he actually yelled this right out loud in English.
*  No!
*  He was only interested in building the house.
*  No characters.
*  Being fantastical, just the house.
*  To this day, Suzuki is not sure why he was so adamant about that.
*  He insists it was not some great principled stand.
*  He just felt like saying no.
*  When he came time to name the place, he didn't name it after Totoro.
*  He named it after the film's two human children, Satsuki and May's house.
*  To build the house, Suzuki enlisted Goro.
*  Goro may not have had his father's animation genius.
*  No one really did.
*  But he had other things.
*  A similar obsession with detail.
*  An iron will.
*  Goro knew construction.
*  He had a good practical head on his shoulders.
*  He'd built the Jibli Museum.
*  He'd be able to solve any logistical problems.
*  And he had people skills that his father lacked.
*  The one thing that's very different from Goro to his father, what sets them apart, is
*  how they use staff members.
*  Suzuki told me.
*  Hiya Miyazaki is maybe not a great leader.
*  But Goro is very good at making the team function.
*  He's very good at bringing the best out of each team member.
*  The whole Totoro House project was a lark.
*  Would the public even be interested in visiting an elaborate wooden replica of a house from
*  a cartoon?
*  Suzuki had no idea.
*  But popularity wasn't really the point.
*  The impulse was deeper than that.
*  Well, it turned out that the public was interested.
*  In 2005, when the world expo opened, Satsuki and May's house was an instant sensation.
*  Such huge floods of Miyazaki fans poured in that everyone worried the house would be ruined.
*  Its artisanal woodworking was not designed for so much traffic.
*  They imposed a limit, 800 visitors a day.
*  But the competition for those 800 spots was so fierce that eventually the expo instituted
*  a lottery system.
*  On an average day, 600,000 people applied.
*  Everyone in Japan seemed to want to put their physical bodies inside the world of Studio
*  Ghibli.
*  Suzuki is still amazed by this.
*  It was just a house.
*  In the expo ended, he said, Ghibli received calls from all over Japan, from North to South,
*  Hokkaido to Okinawa.
*  Everyone wanted Satsuki and May's house to be moved to their city.
*  Suzuki even received a call from the city of Toyota, which was interested in moving the
*  house inside the car company's headquarters.
*  What on earth was this insatiable hunger, I asked Suzuki.
*  Why would so many people go to so much trouble to stand inside an ordinary house?
*  It's an excellent question, he said.
*  In fact, that's exactly what the head of Toyota asked him.
*  Toyota hoped that if they could figure out the source of this public frenzy, it might
*  help them sell their next car.
*  But Suzuki had no good explanation.
*  And in the end, he told everyone that Satsuki and May's house would stay in Nagoya.
*  Many years later, this odd building would become the anchor and the guiding spirit of Ghibli
*  Park.
*  Goro started planning Ghibli Park in 2017.
*  It was similar to Satsuki and May's house, but much bigger, much more complicated.
*  It would require all of his skills.
*  His ability to lead teams of actual humans.
*  His ability to haul his father's imaginary structures, kicking and screaming into reality.
*  Building that Toto-ro house, Goro told me, had been an incredible hassle.
*  Architecturally he discovered the cartoon structure made very little sense.
*  It was tricky to come up with a design that would be both recognizable to viewers of
*  my neighborhood Toto-ro, while also functioning as a real-world house.
*  The traditional woodworking required a highly-select group of artisans.
*  They were proud, opinionated, and stubborn.
*  They argued with Goro over all kinds of things.
*  The blueprints, the height of the ceilings.
*  They didn't want to build a temporary structure, so Goro had to promise to protect it even
*  after the expo ended.
*  Studio Ghibli had planned to paint the house when it was finished, to make it look plausibly
*  old.
*  But the artisans hated that idea, and insisted on aging it in their own way, burning and
*  rubbing the wood, lacquering it with persimmon juice.
*  To make everything worse, the expo's roads were blocked by construction, so carpenters had
*  to drag supplies over a hill.
*  Everything took longer than it was supposed to.
*  When the expo auditors saw the expenses, they thought there had to be some mistake.
*  It's not possible to spend so much money on a single house, they said.
*  We could have built a beautiful modern house for a fraction of this cost.
*  Nevertheless, Goro persisted.
*  He overcame all the obstacles.
*  He built the imaginary house.
*  Unfortunately, however, that triumph did not last.
*  Because somehow, Goro agreed to step out of the real world and into the world of his
*  father.
*  He agreed to direct a Studio Ghibli film.
*  It did not go well.
*  Goro's film, Tales from Earthsea, lacked the energy that defined his father's work, the
*  throbbing physicality, the restless joy, the moral ambiguity.
*  It was to be blunt, stiff and humorless.
*  The villain cackled.
*  The hero was noble.
*  At a screening Miyazaki walked out after only an hour.
*  It felt like I'd been in there for three hours, he said, despondently, before reluctantly
*  heading back in.
*  All of this was captured in the NHK documentary.
*  Still, almost unbelievably, Goro went back for more.
*  He proposed directing a second film.
*  In the end, after some more father-son fireworks, this one from up on Popy Hill was, thank the
*  forest spirit much better than his first.
*  And then came this huge undertaking of Ghibli Park.
*  A theme park in a way had higher stakes for Goro Miyazaki than any single film.
*  This would be a public, physical, visible, globally anticipated translation of his father's
*  imaginative worlds.
*  In Goro would be absolutely in charge.
*  Eventually, after our very long walk through the forest, my guides and I arrived at Satsuke
*  and May's house.
*  As an attraction, it is hilariously minimalist.
*  Almost more conceptual art about a theme park attraction than a proper attraction in itself.
*  This as if a giant hand reached into the film, plucked just this building out and set it
*  down in a clearing in this forest.
*  We stepped inside.
*  The house was clean, small, and crowded.
*  Visitors had removed their shoes as if they were visiting a real person's home.
*  And everyone was just doing house things.
*  Opening drawers, opening closets, turning faucets on and off.
*  The place had been arranged with perfect realism as if a Japanese family actually lived there.
*  To Tommy Mats covered the floor, dishes filled the cupboards.
*  I slid open a closet.
*  Nice, actual blankets folded neatly sat on the shelves.
*  The bathroom had a big round tub just like the one in the film.
*  Outside the yard featured a working water pump.
*  Pull the handle, watch it flow.
*  There was not a single image of Totoro.
*  The most beloved of all the studio jibbly characters, the company's equivalent of Mickey Mouse.
*  Nor could I find any sit sprites.
*  I stepped outside.
*  On one side of the house, down at the ground, people were lining up to peek into a dark hole.
*  In the film, this is the portal through which Totoro emerges.
*  I got in line.
*  Surely there would be a Totoro here.
*  A pair of eyes, at least.
*  Finally, I thought, jibbly park had made me work for it.
*  But I had found a Totoro.
*  I waited my turn.
*  I bent down.
*  The hole was empty.
*  When I told Goro about this experience, he seemed pleased.
*  We wanted to do something authentic, he said.
*  Once you try to bring Totoro into reality, you can only do it with a doll or a robot or
*  someone dressed as Totoro.
*  It would just lose authenticity.
*  I felt that it was more important to have the building give the feeling that Totoro might
*  be there.
*  When you sit in that tatami room, or if you look under the stairs, you feel like he might
*  be hiding.
*  The most theme park-like area of Jibbly Park, a place that you will see all over Instagram,
*  is called Jibbly's Grand Warehouse.
*  From the outside, it absolutely lives up to that name.
*  It is a big giant warehouse, hulking, boxy, utilitarian.
*  It looks as if it might contain a municipal swimming pool, which in fact, it once did.
*  An identical building right next door still contains an ice rink.
*  Now the building is stuffed with Jibblyana, a dense bananza of references and tabloes
*  and scale model buildings.
*  It is colorful chaos.
*  There are fountains and staircases and bright mosaics with Jibbly's signature creatures
*  worked into the patterns.
*  There's a children's play area featuring Totoro and a giant cat bus.
*  There's a grand old-fashioned theater that plays charming short films never released in
*  theaters.
*  I saw one about a group of preschoolers who imagine their way out onto the open sea where
*  they lasso a smiling whale.
*  The Grand Warehouse's main draw was an exhibition called wonderfully.
*  Exhibition, becoming characters in memorable Jibbly scenes.
*  It is a series of life-sized tabloes from beloved studio Jibbly films into which visitors
*  can insert themselves.
*  You can run on top of a giant fish with Ponyo.
*  Pose with a robot from Castle in the sky.
*  Enter the cluttered clubhouse in from up on Poppy Hill or stand with the hunters from Princess
*  Mononoke.
*  Or the most popular choice, you can sit on the train next to No Face.
*  Just pause here briefly to make sure we all fully appreciate No Face.
*  The very best Miyazaki characters, the ones that hit on the deepest spiritual levels, are
*  the ones that do not speak.
*  Totoro, the cat bus, Sutsprites, Kodama, the little rattle-headed forest spirits in Princess
*  Mononoke, and the greatest of all these.
*  One of the great strange miracles in the history of cinema is No Face.
*  No Face is a lonely ghost who appears out of thin air in the middle of spirit it away.
*  He is so simple and deep, so eloquently silent, that it is hard to even describe him, words
*  themselves hesitate.
*  This in fact is partly what No Face is about, the failure of language.
*  He speaks in incoherent mono syllables, ee, ee, ee, ee, tender little noises that nudge
*  their way toward language, but never quite get there.
*  And yet his sounds are full of feeling, full of all that wants to be expressed, but can't.
*  No Face in other words is quintessential Miyazaki.
*  In a 2002 interview, Roger Ebert told Miyazaki he loved the quote, gratuitous motion
*  in his films, the way sometimes people will just sit for a moment or sigh, or gaze at
*  a running stream, or do something extra, not to advance the story, but only to give the
*  sense of time and place and who they are.
*  To which Miyazaki responded, we have a word for that in Japanese.
*  It's called ma, emptiness.
*  It's there intentionally.
*  Miyazaki clapped his hands.
*  The time in between my clapping is ma, he told Ebert.
*  If you just have non-stop action with no breathing space at all, it's just busyness.
*  No Face is ma, come to life.
*  He's a living negation and absent presence, a character so minor that he becomes extremely
*  major.
*  His body is a big black swoop.
*  His face is a white mask in which the eyes and mouth are just black holes.
*  No Face's body is semi-transparent so you can actually see the background right through
*  him.
*  This was the one experience I absolutely wanted to have at Jibli Park, the thing I had
*  been fantasizing about from thousands of miles away, to sit next to no face.
*  I wanted to enter Miyazaki's most iconic singing.
*  No Face sitting expressionless on a red velvet seat on an ethereal train near the end of
*  spirited away.
*  I needed to sit there with him to put my real 3D body next to his fake 3D body.
*  I needed to feel that I was gliding over the water, lonely but not alone on his sad,
*  hopeful journey.
*  Unfortunately, this turned out not to be possible.
*  Everyone else in Japan seemed to have come to Jibli Park to take this photo.
*  The line seemed infinite.
*  My guides simply acknowledged that given the time constraints of our tour, the weight
*  would be too long.
*  They did not offer even for a second to let me cut the line, which I appreciated because
*  I almost certainly would have done it, thereby violating the whole anti-greet ethos of
*  spirited away.
*  As a consolation, my guides took my photo in a different tablo.
*  This one was a very short line.
*  It was the climactic scene from Porco Rosso, Miyazaki's story of an Italian pig pilot.
*  This is not one of my favorite Jibli films, but I would take what I could get.
*  In the tablo, a huge crowd cheers as Porco is face battered and swollen, throws a punch.
*  I stepped into the fight, tilting my body to absorb Porco's punch, pretending to punch
*  him back.
*  It felt completely ridiculous.
*  The PR team took my photo.
*  It looks as ridiculous as I felt.
*  I left the Grand Warehouse feeling I have to say mildly disappointed.
*  I had not sat with no face.
*  Nor had I enjoyed the concession stand that offers, as the website puts it, quote,
*  local milk in a glass bottle with an original design.
*  There was another infinite line.
*  Despite all its color, the Grand Warehouse felt static, plastic, a little anticlimactic.
*  Unlike in Jibli's films, nothing moved.
*  Part of me, again the American part, had been expecting to be shocked, entertained, thrown
*  around.
*  It was hard to imagine Hayami Azaki, the genius world builder, the man obsessed with motion,
*  building a place so oddly still, he would have built a rollicking theme park.
*  In fact, Toshio Suzuki told me, that had once been his plan.
*  Not many people knew this, but a long time ago Hayami Azaki went to Disneyland and he loved
*  it.
*  He kept it to himself, he never said that at home, that he had fun at Disneyland, but I know
*  what happened.
*  In fact, Miyazaki had so much fun that he came back to Japan dreaming of building a theme
*  park of his own.
*  He sketched secret plans of Jibli-themed roller coasters.
*  Suzuki saw them, but these plans never came to pass.
*  Goro wasn't interested.
*  The Grand Warehouse Goro told me was motionless by design.
*  He felt that even the most advanced theme park effects, rides, virtual reality, could never
*  compare with the experience of watching Studio Jibli's films.
*  So he didn't even try.
*  The absence of attractions, the lack of motion in the Grand Warehouse, it was all perfectly
*  intentional.
*  It's the visitors that create the motion, he said.
*  The characters don't move, so the visitors have to move themselves.
*  People get very creative interacting with the scenes, whether you enjoy it or not, and
*  how you enjoy it, is up to you.
*  And I think that is more Jibli-esque.
*  A couple of weeks before it opened, Miyazaki visited Jibli-Park.
*  Toshio Suzuki went with him.
*  Goro gave them a tour.
*  The park Miyazaki said was something that I wouldn't have come up with myself.
*  He looked a little lonely, Suzuki told me.
*  Maybe thinking that his time was up.
*  My favorite experience of Jibli-Park, the most Jibli-Park experience of all, came at
*  the very end.
*  It involved no lines, no merch, no Miyazaki characters, and yet somehow it felt steered
*  or framed or made possible by Miyazaki.
*  Back at the train station, after my tour, I said goodbye to my guides.
*  Then I turned and walked over the sea of concrete, back down the hill, past the Grand
*  Warehouse, through the spirited away gate, and I followed the path back into the forest.
*  The forest was, after all, the whole point of this park, its inspiration, the thing that
*  father and son could always absolutely agree on.
*  I plunged into the trees and started wandering at random.
*  The forest was not, like so many of the forests in Miyazaki's films, ancient and primeval.
*  It was younger, more modest.
*  World War II left Nagoya and its surroundings in ruins.
*  The city was destroyed by bombs.
*  The trees were cut down.
*  Much of the soil had been stripped to make clay.
*  This forest was planted in the years following the war as an intentional act of recovery.
*  Since then, these trees had been struggling to grow in that white, clay heavy soil.
*  That's why they looked the way they did.
*  Lean, hungry, twisting.
*  They had to work harder than trees in other places.
*  This as part of Ygorro was determined not to cut down a single one.
*  When a few trees got in the way of Jibli Park's construction, he had them carefully moved.
*  I kept walking.
*  I scaled steep wooden stairways.
*  Very few other people were out hiking, so most of the time it felt as if we were all alone,
*  me and the trees.
*  I considered the Japanese term forest bathing.
*  The notion that walking through trees cleanses your soul.
*  I walked on boardwalks that stretched up toward the canopy.
*  I thought about how this was a place I never would have visited in 100 lifetimes, this
*  unfamous, small forest in a municipal park on the outskirts of an industrial city in Japan.
*  And how this was exactly Goro's plan to lure people here with the promise of Jibli's
*  imaginary world and then to give them this real one.
*  This place was real, and I was real, and those two realities were overlapping.
*  Trees, trees, trees.
*  It was entirely up to me where to go, what to look at, when to leave.
*  I stopped to watch a spider working in some upper branches, building a large web, twisting
*  and prancing, silhouetted against the blue sky.
*  I passed clusters of fallen acorns on the ground, the forest replenishing itself.
*  And they made me think about Totoro, and thinking about Totoro made me notice more acorns,
*  and soon I stooped to collect some.
*  I filled my pockets.
*  I was happy.
*  And it struck me that this was exactly what I went into Miyazaki's films for, and what
*  Miyazaki's animation almost paradoxically did for me.
*  It helped me to find reality, to really see it, to experience it as real, ordinary and
*  strange, boring and surprising.
*  Jibli Park, in its simplicity, honored this spirit completely.
*  Goro's vision of a theme park was more radical than the grandest roller coaster could ever
*  be.
*  As the sun started to set, I followed a steep path to the top of a hill.
*  There was a little clearing with wooden benches, an old informational sign from the world
*  expo.
*  It looked like a place no one had been in ten years.
*  I went inside a small wooden building that turned out to be a bathroom.
*  Taped up on a utility closet, with thick green tape, was a single sheet of paper.
*  It seemed to be some kind of sign.
*  I examined it.
*  It showed a blurry photo of a stout monkey standing on all fours.
*  There was some Japanese text underneath, so I ran it through my phone's translation
*  app.
*  The sign was a warning for hikers, but in that moment, it read to me like a poem or a whole
*  life philosophy.
*  Do not make eye contact with monkeys.
*  Do not feed the monkeys or expose them to food.
*  After a while, we will move.
*  Not stimulating, please.
