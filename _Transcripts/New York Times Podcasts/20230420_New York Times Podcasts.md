# The Blockbuster Fox Defamation Trial That Wasnâ€™t
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4Bt1eP4q4o)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro.
*  This is a daily.
*  Today, why at the very last minute both Dominion voting systems and Fox News decided to settle
*  the most closely watched defamation lawsuit in decades, rather than make their case at
*  trial?
*  My colleague, Jeremy Peters, was inside the courtroom as it happened.
*  It's Thursday, April 20th.
*  Jeremy, you were at this very moment supposed to be in a Delaware courtroom covering day
*  two of this blockbuster defamation trial.
*  And instead, based on your background on this Google Hangout, you are not in a courtroom.
*  You are in a hotel room.
*  That's right.
*  Where I'm doing reporting, trying to figure out how this all fell apart.
*  We had an 11th hour settlement in the case that no one really anticipated.
*  This case had gone on for two years with no serious settlement talks.
*  And now both parties have agreed to make this go away for $787.5 million.
*  That's what Fox will pay to Dominion voting systems, sparing Fox the really potentially
*  embarrassing spectacle of having the chairman of its company, Rupert Murdoch, its star hosts
*  like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity from taking the witness stand.
*  Right.
*  Let's talk about why this has all happened, because it did feel very much unexpected.
*  The last time you came on the show, Jeremy, to preview this trial, a settlement wasn't
*  really even anything we dwelled on.
*  It felt that remote a possibility.
*  That's right.
*  For two years, there had been no serious talks of a settlement by either side.
*  Dominion had what legal scholars described as the strongest defamation case they had
*  seen against a media organization.
*  And remind us why that was.
*  So remember that Dominion is suing Fox News for what Fox broadcast about it after the
*  2020 election.
*  Dominion was at the center of all of these conspiracy theories that claimed its machines
*  were somehow susceptible to hacking and that people had gotten inside them and flipped
*  votes that belonged to Trump, to President Biden.
*  And Dominion's case is that those statements were defamatory.
*  They were false.
*  And in order to win, Dominion would have had to prove that people at Fox knew that what
*  they were saying on the air was false, but did so anyway.
*  Or they would have to prove that people at Fox acted with an extreme degree of recklessness.
*  Dominion's able to do that because as part of the lawsuit, it's able to get its hands
*  on thousands and thousands of emails and text messages that Fox News producers, hosts and
*  executives were exchanging in which you can see they really express doubt and in some
*  cases outright scorn about the allegations that President Trump and his supporters were
*  making about fraud in the 2020 election.
*  For example, you had text messages from Tucker Carlson in which he mocks Trump because his
*  legal team and his campaign team incompetent.
*  You also have skepticism from the chairman of the company himself, Rupert Murdoch, who
*  is also casting doubt on these voter fraud claims that his network is still promoting
*  at the time.
*  Right.
*  So if your Dominion and the basis of your lawsuit is showing that Fox News was lying about you
*  and knew it was lying about you, these pieces of evidence were looking very powerful.
*  Yes, but despite all the evidence, Fox still believed it had a chance in the case.
*  And that's because defamation is really difficult to prove to a jury.
*  All it takes is one or two people to decide that Dominion hadn't met its burden and hadn't
*  sufficiently explained the states of minds of the people at Fox who were making decisions
*  about their election coverage.
*  It may not have been very easy or as easy as Dominion hoped it would be to prove that
*  Fox intentionally misled its audience for profit.
*  Right, which is why by early April, both sides are feeling pretty good about their chances
*  at trial and hurtling towards that trial.
*  So when does that all really start to change?
*  So in the run up to the trial, as happens before all trials like this, the judge makes
*  a series of decisions about the parameters of the case, the ground rules for how each
*  side can make its arguments and what they can tell a jury.
*  But in what was a series of disappointing developments for Fox, the judge makes three
*  big decisions against them.
*  First is the judge basically makes Dominion's job much easier by ruling that they don't
*  have to prove any of these statements made on Fox's airwaves were false.
*  Typically in a defamation case, that's a big task for the plaintiffs.
*  The judge said, look, these statements that Dominion machines were hackable, that you
*  could go in and switch votes from one candidate to another are so preposterous that I'm not
*  even going to ask the jury to consider whether or not they're false.
*  So Dominion is relieved of a significant burden there and is really only left with one job
*  to prove that Fox knew it was lying to its audience about voter fraud.
*  So you're saying the judge in this case, in a sense, kind of gives Dominion the legal
*  equivalent of an easy pass and makes its job from the outset a lot easier and smaller than
*  it might have been under different circumstances.
*  Correct.
*  And again, that speaks to the strength of the evidence against Fox News and just how
*  exceptional this case has been.
*  I mean, judges don't typically do that in a defamation case.
*  OK, what's the second thing that happens?
*  The judge really takes away Fox's ability to argue the defense it wanted to argue.
*  It had really argued that the First Amendment protected the commentary that was uttered
*  on its network about the election.
*  And what they were trying to say was, look, we didn't do anything wrong here.
*  Yes, the president may have been lying, but it was our obligation to report that as a
*  news organization.
*  These were inherently newsworthy statements, even though they were false.
*  What's more newsworthy, Fox said, than a president of the United States contesting his election.
*  But the judge said, no, that's not the law.
*  You can't argue that.
*  And if you do, I'm going to turn to the jury and tell them to disregard what you're saying
*  that you're wrong.
*  And why did the judge say that?
*  Because that argument has always seemed somewhat reasonable under most conventional understandings
*  of the First Amendment.
*  Yes, that's absolutely right.
*  And you could see how it would be compelling to a jury.
*  But that's not what the law says.
*  The law actually doesn't protect journalists like you and me from repeating false statements.
*  If it's false, then it can be considered defamatory by a jury.
*  And if that weren't enough, then a third thing happens.
*  The judge determines that Fox has not been forthcoming with him, that it misled dominion
*  about Rupert Murdoch's formal role within Fox News.
*  Initially, what Fox said is Rupert Murdoch is not a corporate officer for Fox.
*  Now that's significant because under Delaware law, if you're a corporate officer, you can
*  be compelled to testify in person.
*  Fox wanted to prevent that.
*  And it told Dominion that Rupert Murdoch was not a corporate officer.
*  Well, it turned out that that wasn't true.
*  Got it.
*  And Fox had to disclose this to the court.
*  And the judge was furious.
*  So he issues a sanction against Fox and he tells Fox's lawyers that he's really starting
*  to worry about their credibility.
*  Which is definitely the wrong foot to get off on with the judge overseeing your billion
*  dollar defamation case.
*  But Jeremy, why was it so important for Fox to keep Rupert Murdoch off the stand, which
*  is perhaps what motivated it to mislead the court and dominion about his title with Fox?
*  Rupert Murdoch was going to be a potentially problematic witness for Fox.
*  He was deposed in January by Dominion lawyers.
*  And in that deposition, he said things that were not helpful.
*  At one point during his deposition, he states that Fox hosts had actually endorsed President
*  Trump's lies about the 2020 election.
*  And that's significant because that's effectively Dominion's whole case.
*  They have argued to the judge that they were defamed because Fox News hosts and guests
*  endorsed the president's falsehoods.
*  They did more than just cover them as news.
*  They promoted them.
*  So suddenly the most powerful person at Fox is helping Dominion make its own case.
*  That's exactly right.
*  And Rupert Murdoch seems to know that his deposition did not go well because once it's
*  over, his general counsel tries to buck him up and says, they didn't lay a finger on
*  you.
*  Murdoch then points to Dominion's lawyer who's just opposed him and says, I think he would
*  disagree with you.
*  And he says, indeed, I do, sir.
*  So if you're Fox, you don't want to have Rupert Murdoch on the stand, and yet he is now going
*  to be on the stand.
*  Your legal arguments are starting to be knocked down by the judge and Dominion's legal burdens
*  are getting lighter by the day.
*  So this is turning out to be a bit of a disaster.
*  Right.
*  Heading into trial, Fox essentially has three strikes against it.
*  And you would think that would motivate them to settle the case.
*  But that doesn't happen.
*  They're pretty stubborn.
*  They have a plan that even if they lose in Delaware, they want to appeal this and make
*  it a First Amendment case that they believe can get all the way to the very conservative
*  Supreme Court and that they would be on strong legal footing there.
*  Interesting.
*  So they're going to roll the dice.
*  So here we are on Tuesday morning in Delaware Superior Court in downtown Wilmington.
*  The jury has been sworn in, seated.
*  The lawyers for both sides have microphones clipped to their lapels and they are getting
*  ready to make their opening statements.
*  In this trial, the biggest, most significant media defamation case in a generation is happening.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Jeremy, tell us about the scene inside this Delaware courtroom as lawyers for both
*  sides are mic'd up and it very much becomes clear that this trial is for real.
*  So there's about a hundred people packed into this courtroom.
*  It's stiflingly hot.
*  We're expecting the jury to come back after its lunch break for the opening arguments
*  in the trial to begin.
*  But then nothing happens.
*  Ten minutes go by, 20 minutes go by, two hours goes by.
*  Nothing.
*  Not a word from the judge.
*  The attorneys aren't talking to reporters telling them what's going on.
*  But we start to notice activity.
*  The lawyers for both sides are shuttling back and forth from their conference table in front
*  of the bench to a conference room outside in the hall.
*  So something is clearly going on.
*  And what are you thinking might be going on?
*  I almost threw up.
*  I'm serious.
*  Why?
*  Well, I've spent so much time and mental energy on this case, preparing for this trial, we
*  think is going to go on for six weeks, that I had been told by my sources had very little
*  chance of settling.
*  And here it looks like they're going to settle.
*  So deep down, you know what's going on and what's coming.
*  Maybe no one's saying it out loud, but you are feeling like settlement is in the air.
*  That's right.
*  So then, just before four o'clock, the judge enters the courtroom.
*  We haven't laid eyes on him in four hours.
*  He's been back in his chambers the whole time.
*  He brings the jury in, they're seated, and he very matter of factly tells them the parties
*  have resolved this case.
*  And this is such a surprise that there are gasps in the room.
*  It seemed like whatever stubbornness Fox had against settling this case finally evaporated
*  and the reality of the actual trial itself dawned on them.
*  And so they came to the table.
*  And what do you end up learning about the nature of this last minute settlement?
*  Well, we don't know a whole lot right away.
*  It takes about a half an hour.
*  Dominion's lawyers leave the courtroom and they come outside where they hold an impromptu
*  press conference for the dozens of reporters who have gathered on the courthouse steps
*  to hear what they have to say.
*  Today's settlement of $787,500,000 represents vindication and accountability.
*  Lies have consequences.
*  First, the lawyers for Dominion reveal the amount and it's staggering.
*  $787.5 million.
*  Money is accountability.
*  And we got that today from Fox.
*  This is the largest defamation settlement that we know of ever happening.
*  Then Dominion tells us what this case was about to them and what that dollar figure
*  represents.
*  For our democracy to endure for another 250 years and hopefully much longer, we must share
*  a commitment to facts.
*  They frame this in very lofty terms about the vitality and health of our democracy and
*  the need to hold those accountable who spread lies that undermined our democratic system
*  and really tore the country apart.
*  And so thank you and we'll see you at the next one.
*  And what do you come to understand that Dominion is getting beyond just $787 million, which
*  it is framing as a form of accountability, but may not have been entirely what they wanted?
*  It's not getting one thing that I think many people involved in this case were hoping to
*  see from Fox and that's an apology.
*  And sometimes in these cases, a formal apology will be part of the settlement.
*  But that didn't happen here.
*  Interesting.
*  Fox doesn't have to say that they wronged Dominion or express any contrition or regret
*  about that.
*  Fox's statement explaining its version of what happened just says in very generic language
*  that it acknowledges the court's finding that these statements about Dominion machines
*  that were made on its airwaves were false.
*  Hmm.
*  And, Jeremy, let's talk about Dominion's motives for accepting the settlement that you're describing
*  here with a lot of money, but not any formal apology or profound admission of fault.
*  I very much understand why Fox would want to settle in the way that it did, given the
*  way the case was going.
*  But why would Dominion?
*  Well, the trial is a big roll of the dice for them, too.
*  They don't know what 12 men and women on that jury are going to do.
*  It's also a lot of money.
*  Seven hundred and eighty seven million dollars is about 10 times what the company that owns
*  Dominion paid for it.
*  And by accepting a settlement, Dominion's guaranteed that money.
*  It means that an appellate court can't reduce the size of that settlement.
*  And oftentimes that is exactly what happens on appeals of cases like this.
*  Got it.
*  So a big reason to settle for Dominion is that a settlement of seven hundred and eighty
*  seven million dollars is a bird in the hand or seven hundred and eighty seven million
*  birds in their hand.
*  I get that.
*  But this case always seemed to be about more than money for Dominion.
*  That's what the company's leaders told the public.
*  And that was true for a lot of other people watching the case.
*  This trial was about forcing Fox and the people who watch it to reckon with the reality
*  that they had been told lies and to come to terms with the fact that the big lie is a
*  big lie.
*  This was supposed to be a trial about all those things, not just about Fox.
*  So by avoiding that kind of a trial and that kind of reckoning with a settlement, is there
*  any sense that Dominion has kind of sold everyone out?
*  Some might argue that.
*  But I think you have to look at the big picture here.
*  We may never get to see Tucker Carlson grilled on the stand or Rupert Murdoch.
*  But what we do have is this catalog of statements that Fox employees made privately that show
*  us many of them don't really believe what they say about President Trump.
*  They didn't believe what was being said about Dominion machines and that they didn't really
*  believe that the election was stolen or tampered with.
*  And what you also see in these text messages and emails is Fox News employees saying they
*  were petrified their audience would leave if they didn't tell the audience what the
*  audience wanted to hear.
*  We know all this now.
*  And in that sense, Dominion has achieved a big part of what it set out to do here in
*  exposing that reality inside Fox News.
*  That said, Jeremy, we had always thought that perhaps a trial that ended with a verdict
*  that found Fox had defamed Dominion, that that might be the one thing that could change
*  Fox's skewed approach to the news.
*  It might force Fox to rethink the way that it caters to its conservative audience.
*  Maybe that was always naive.
*  But I wonder in your mind as someone who has covered Fox and the conservative movement
*  so closely for years, what a settlement means for that possibility that Fox would see this
*  case as a deterrent and would start being a different network.
*  I don't think there's any version of this trial that would have changed Fox's behavior
*  in any real and meaningful way.
*  It's just too big a business for them.
*  The notion that they would get crosswise with their audience is something we now know because
*  of this lawsuit, they're afraid of doing.
*  And they don't see any business model in becoming a moderate, centrist, conservative network
*  or in becoming a network that levels with its audience.
*  So Jeremy, in the end, being Fox and embracing at times conspiracy theories and sometimes
*  lies that meet its viewers where they are, the price of that for Fox may be once in a
*  while having to pay out a big defamation settlement.
*  But in the end, it may be worth it because it's still earning, as we all know, billions
*  of dollars a year.
*  That's right.
*  This settlement is going to dent Fox, but it's not going to bankrupt it.
*  It still has billions and billions of dollars.
*  The way that Fox has settled this case shows us that that's a cost that they're perfectly
*  acceptable writing down.
*  If it's more painful to tell their audience the truth than to write a check, they're going
*  to write that check.
*  Perhaps over and over and over again.
*  Yes, I think so, Michael.
*  Well, Jeremy, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  Fox News and its executives face several more legal challenges over its coverage of the
*  2020 election.
*  A Fox shareholder has sued Rupert Murdoch and other members of Fox News' board of directors
*  for allowing the network to broadcast false claims about the election.
*  Meanwhile, the voting machine company Smartmatic has sued Fox for falsely claiming that its
*  machines played a role in election fraud in a defamation case seeking $2.7 billion in
*  damages.
*  In a statement issued after the Dominion settlement was announced, Smartmatic said, quote, Dominion's
*  litigation exposed some of the misconduct and damage caused by Fox's disinformation
*  campaign.
*  Smartmatic will expose the rest.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  In a highly anticipated decision, the Supreme Court gave itself until the end of the week
*  to decide whether Mifepristone, a drug used by millions of women to end their pregnancies,
*  should remain widely available.
*  The Court had originally set a deadline of Wednesday to rule on access to the drug as
*  it reviews a controversial Texas ruling which tried to ban the drug, finding that its original
*  approval by the FDA in 2000 was flawed.
*  Today's episode was produced by Ricky Nowitzki, Will Reed and Carlos Prieto.
