# The Charges Against Trump for Conspiring to Overturn the Election
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7PcnEC12sc)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro. This is The Daily.
*  Today, an indictment was unsealed, charging Donald J. Trump with conspiring to defraud
*  the United States, conspiring to disenfranchise voters, and conspiring and attempting to obstruct
*  ...
*  On Tuesday afternoon, Special Counsel Jack Smith filed criminal charges against former
*  President Donald Trump for his wide-ranging attempt to overthrow the 2020 election.
*  Described in the indictment, it was fueled by lies. Lies by the defendant targeted at
*  obstructing a bedrock function of the U.S. government, the nation's process of collecting,
*  counting, and certifying the results of the presidential election.
*  My colleague, Luke Broadwater, talks us through the historic indictment and the evidence
*  it lays out that Trump waged an illegal conspiracy to remain in power.
*  My office will seek a speedy trial so that our evidence can be tested in court and judged
*  by a jury of citizens.
*  It's Wednesday, August 2nd.
*  Luke, we are talking to you at 8.30 p.m. or so on Tuesday night. It's been about three
*  hours since Donald Trump was indicted. And it's pretty strange to speak of indictments
*  against a former president as routine, but when it comes to Trump, they have become strangely
*  routine. This is number three in just the past few months.
*  Yeah, we've never seen anything like it in American history. That's something we often
*  talking about the Trump presidency or Donald Trump in general. But yes, this is the third
*  indictment of a former American president who is his party's leading candidate to run
*  again for the White House. And this indictment is probably the most consequential of them
*  all, certainly in terms of the magnitude of the allegations. And that is the effort to
*  overturn the 2020 election that culminated with the January 6th storming of the Capitol.
*  Right. And while on one level, it's not surprising that these charges are being brought, given
*  everything we've learned from, for instance, the January 6th Congressional Committee's
*  investigation. On another level, it is surprising that these charges are being brought against
*  Trump because it was always very unclear whether the former president's role in everything
*  leading up to January 6th would meet the very high legal bar of criminality. And clearly
*  today, the Department of Justice is saying it does meet that bar.
*  Yeah, that's exactly right, Michael. I mean, January 6th happened two and a half years ago.
*  And a lot of observers, especially Democrats, thought Donald Trump should be charged
*  immediately. That didn't happen. And for a long time, the only people who were getting
*  charged in connection with January 6th were low level rioters and no political actors
*  were being held accountable. And a lot of political observers and legal observers thought,
*  well, maybe this case will never break into the political realm to people like Donald Trump and
*  his top lieutenants. Maybe it's just too hard of a case to make that the attempts to overturn the
*  election were perhaps unethical, but not illegal. And what happened today was the Justice Department
*  said, absolutely not. Those were crimes and they were very specific and serious crimes.
*  So then what is the special counsel's legal case as established in the indictment against
*  Donald Trump? And just to start, I wonder if you could actually read from some of the actual
*  indictment itself. Sure. So the case is the United States of America versus Donald Trump.
*  And at the top, it says, the defendant, Donald J. Trump, was the 45th president of the United States
*  and a candidate for reelection in 2020. The defendant lost the 2020 presidential election.
*  Despite having lost, the defendant was determined to remain in power. So for more than two months
*  following election day on November 3rd, 2020, the defendant spread lies that there had been an
*  outcome determinative fraud in the election and that he had actually won. These claims were false
*  and the defendant knew that they were false, but the defendant repeated and widely disseminated them
*  anyway to make his knowingly false claims appear legitimate, create an intense national atmosphere
*  of mistrust and anger and erode public faith in the administration of the election.
*  Right. None of which feels like entirely new information, but walk us through
*  precisely what Trump has been charged with here in this indictment, the actual charges.
*  Right. Well, there are four charges. The first is conspiracy to defraud the United States.
*  The second is conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding that refers to the
*  official proceeding of Congress that was taking place when the mob stormed in the building.
*  The third is obstruction of an attempt to obstruct an official proceeding.
*  And the fourth, and this is an interesting one, is a conspiracy against rights. This is a deprivation
*  of rights under the color of law. This is an old code that was introduced after the civil war,
*  basically to prevent the KKK and other racists of blocking black people from going to the polls
*  and interfering with an election. So this fourth charge accuses the president of denying or seeking
*  to deny Americans their franchise, their right to vote in 2020. Yeah. You know, I was just talking
*  with Jamie Raskin, one of the members of the January 6th committee about this, and he highlighted
*  that charge to me as we were speaking because he said, look, this was an attempt to basically
*  throw out millions and millions of American votes to change the outcome of an election.
*  And if that isn't, you know, a major assault on the voting system in America, then he doesn't
*  know what is. So he felt that that was a particularly important charge to highlight.
*  Interesting. And how does this indictment end up explaining and justifying these four charges? Does
*  it link the charges to specific evidence? So the indictment isn't set up quite like that. It doesn't
*  list specific facts for each of the specific charges. What it does do is lay out one grand
*  narrative about Donald Trump's conduct and then assert that this conduct violates those four
*  criminal counts. And it starts off, interestingly enough, by saying Donald Trump's attempts to fight
*  the election results started legally, that he has a right as a contestant in an election to make
*  claims about the election results. He even has a right to make false claims or even lie about the
*  results that by itself isn't a crime. And he had a right to try to challenge the results in court.
*  And Mr. Trump did. He filed more than 60 lawsuits. But then it says what he didn't have a right to do
*  is after he knew it was a lie, and after he had failed in court repeatedly, he didn't have a right
*  to then launch a criminal conspiracy to overturn the results of the election through illegal means.
*  That's when the Justice Department says it became a crime. I'm curious what elements of that grand
*  narrative written into this indictment stand out to you, Luke? Well, anybody who watched any of the
*  January 6 committee hearings or read any part of the report, or frankly, even read a newspaper,
*  probably is familiar with some parts of this indictment. So the indictment really focuses on
*  sort of a five step plan of Donald Trump and his co-conspirators to stay in office. And the first
*  is a pressure campaign that was launched against state and local election officials to try to get
*  them to throw out votes for Biden, to maybe switch votes, to do whatever they could to get
*  Donald Trump to win those states or win those counties. The second is a scheme that the January
*  6 committee called the fake electors scheme. And that is a plan that was put into action by
*  Donald Trump's lawyers, in which they organized slates of electors in states that had been won
*  by Joe Biden. And those people then met and pretended that Donald Trump had won those states
*  and they filled out forms, falsely asserting that Donald Trump was the true winner of those states.
*  And then they sent those forms to Congress with the hopes that Mike Pence would accept them
*  and use that evidence to overturn the results in Congress and award the election to Donald Trump.
*  The third way Donald Trump tried to cling to power, and this is also laid out in the indictment,
*  is he tried to use the power of the Justice Department as part of this whole scheme.
*  There was an effort by a gentleman named Jeffrey Clark within the Justice Department
*  to send a false letter to state officials that would say the Justice Department had found fraud
*  in these states and that therefore they should stand down from certifying these election results.
*  And so that letter wasn't, if it had gone out, would have been a completely false letter that
*  would have been used to manipulate the election results through the power of the Justice Department.
*  The fourth example that the indictment alleges is that Donald Trump pressured his own vice president
*  to delay certification of the election in Congress or even throw out the results of the election.
*  And there's some testimony in this indictment that I hadn't seen before. It wasn't in the
*  January 6th Committee Report, but that in a heated debate over this, that Donald Trump says to Mike
*  Pence, you're too honest. When Pence says, I don't want to do this thing you want me to do,
*  not certify the results of the election, Trump's response to his vice president is,
*  you are too willing to follow the rules. Yes, that Mike Pence, you're a boy scout,
*  you always listen to the rules, you're too honest. You should just go along with me in this plan so
*  that we can stay in office and stay in power. And what is the fifth and final part of this
*  Trump plan that the indictment cites? The final part of the plan brings us to the day of January
*  6th itself when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building. And what it alleges is that
*  Donald Trump not only doesn't try to stop them, but he essentially encourages them on and attempts
*  to use the violence and the unrest at the Capitol as a way to halt certifying of the election results
*  and to cling to power to stay in office. From what I'm hearing you say, the indictment doesn't
*  accuse Trump or doesn't seem to be all that focused on the idea that Trump incited the January 6th
*  riot. Is that correct? It's instead more focused on the idea that once the riot was underway,
*  he tried to turn it into yet another way to avoid a transfer of power. Yeah, I think most laypeople,
*  when you think of January 6th, a lot of people have been looking for the smoking gun when Donald
*  Trump directed the Proud Boys to attack or something like that. And this indictment is
*  saying that doesn't exist. We don't need that. All you need to do is prove that he tried to obstruct
*  Congress on January 6th. And he did it through multiple ways. And one of them was once the
*  violence is underway, he attempts to take advantage of that violence to delay the proceedings and stay
*  in office. So taken together, these five actions established in the indictment, they amount,
*  it says, to an illegal conspiracy to defraud Americans into thinking the election was fraudulent,
*  which it wasn't, block the transfer of power and ultimately overturn the election.
*  Right. And the thing that really is a thread through all of them is the deceitfulness
*  that's alleged on behalf of Donald Trump. The indictment lays out example after example,
*  where they say former President Trump deliberately disregarded the truth. And it includes examples
*  where he's told by his most trusted advisors that there is no widespread fraud. He's told by Vice
*  President Mike Pence. He's told by the senior leaders of the Justice Department. He's told by
*  the director of national intelligence. He's told by Homeland Security. He's told by senior White
*  House attorneys, state officials, state legislators, state and federal courts over and over again.
*  The indictment lays out example after example, in which Donald Trump is told that he lost this
*  election and there was no widespread fraud. And so it concludes that he knew he was lying
*  about the election results, but he continued to do so anyway.
*  Absolutely.
*  Which quite importantly in a prosecution establishes intent, intent to defraud,
*  intent to obstruct.
*  Absolutely. If the allegation is he defrauded the American people,
*  then his intent is a very important element of that charge.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So look, how strong does the legal case laid out in this indictment appear to be based on what's
*  in the indictment and based on all the reporting you have done about this alleged conspiracy to
*  overturn the election? Well, we know that Donald Trump will fight this indictment vigorously. He's
*  already started to attack the integrity of Jack Smith, the integrity of the Justice Department,
*  but he's going to be facing in some ways an uphill battle. This case is going to be tried
*  in Washington, D.C., where the alleged crimes took place and where Jack Smith filed these charges.
*  Donald Trump is not popular in Washington, D.C. And in fact, many people who live in D.C.
*  remember the events of January 6 quite well. They remember the city in turmoil that day.
*  They remember the National Guard coming in and the fences being put up around the Capitol and
*  it being closed off to the public for so long. So he's not going to have the most favorable jury
*  to start with. The other thing I would say is in speaking with members of the January 6 committee
*  who investigated this case before Jack Smith, many of them are federal prosecutors or former
*  federal prosecutors. And it was their opinion that they had the facts and the evidence to charge
*  Donald Trump months ago and that they would have a strong case. And in that time, Jack Smith has
*  only built an even stronger case because he has gotten testimony from top people who the January
*  6 committee could not get to testify before them. So he's gone deeper and broader than even the
*  January 6 committee could go. Now, what's interesting is much of that material is not in this indictment.
*  This indictment is only 45 pages long. The January 6 committee report was 845 pages long.
*  So we know Jack Smith is sitting on evidence that he has not used in this indictment.
*  Why would he do that though, Luke? Why would he keep it out of the indictment?
*  Well, that may be a strategic decision. In presenting a case, you want to have a simple,
*  clean narrative that's easy for the public to understand, that's easy for a court to understand.
*  And keep in mind, a prosecutor can always bring a superseding indictment, which is essentially an
*  updated indictment with even more evidence and even more damning accusations. And we actually saw
*  this prosecutor, Jack Smith, do this in the documents case against Donald Trump just a few
*  days ago. So it's quite possible that Jack Smith could bring more charges as a later date and that
*  he's continuing to work on it. And one thing that leads me to believe that is that in this indictment,
*  Jack Smith made the conscious decision not to charge or name six co-conspirators
*  to Donald Trump. So he lists six people that we in the media know who they are because we've been
*  investigating the case, but Jack Smith chose not to name them. He chose not to charge them.
*  And what I believe after talking to legal observers is those people are now going to
*  have some tough choices to make. They're going to have to decide whether they want to cooperate
*  with Jack Smith's investigation or whether they want to fight the investigation and risk criminal
*  charges. So I fully expect there to be more shoes to drop in this case and potentially more
*  indictments down the line. So perhaps what's happening here is that the special counsel
*  is working behind the scenes on a much more damning version of this indictment than the spare one
*  we have seen tonight. And that one may only get stronger and stronger as he invites these co-conspirators
*  into his office and ask them to give even more evidence against Trump. And the implied threat
*  here, if they don't, is, look, I just indicted the former president, so you better believe I'm willing
*  to indict you. So give me even more information that will just strengthen my case against Trump.
*  That could be the strategy. Take Rudy Giuliani, for instance. He's clearly co-conspirator number one
*  in the indictment. One strategy for Jack Smith could be to invite Rudy Giuliani in and say,
*  why don't you tell me some things about Donald Trump that I don't already know?
*  And in exchange for that, maybe you won't be charged. So that is definitely one path Jack
*  Smith could go down with these six co-conspirators who are not yet themselves facing any criminal
*  charges. Really interesting. So at this moment, given what's laid out in this indictment,
*  what kind of penalty could Donald Trump face if ultimately after a trial in Washington,
*  D.C., he is convicted on these four charges? Well, he faces a very significant prison sentence.
*  Two of the counts against him carry up to five years in prison and two of them carry up to 20
*  years in prison. So he does face the potential right now of decades in prison. Right. By my math,
*  perhaps up to 50 years in prison. I'm curious, would any of these charges disqualify Trump if
*  he's convicted of them from actually serving as president? That's a very interesting question,
*  Michael. My first point on that would be not on its face. He's not charged with sedition.
*  He's not charged with insurrection. The 14th Amendment has a ban on insurrectionists holding
*  public office. That said, were he to be convicted in connection with attempting to overturn the
*  2020 election, one could see legal challenges saying that that conviction disqualifies him from
*  holding office. That's still an open legal question. But that said, if Donald Trump does
*  regain the presidency, he can appoint a new attorney general and he can direct that attorney
*  general to drop the charges against him. Hmm. Look, I want to end by returning in a way to where
*  we began, which was the reality that this is the third indictment against Trump, the most important
*  by almost every measure, but the third. And that raises an important question about fatigue.
*  A lot of Americans will hear about this and say, another Trump indictment? And we always kind of
*  understood this, the reality that the previous indictments and their focus on things that are
*  arguably less important, hush money payments and classified documents that might dilute the power
*  of an indictment that was arguably far more important over an effort to overturn an election.
*  Does it feel like that is now possibly the case that because this has arrived as the third
*  indictment that many Americans may kind of shrug? I think that's probably true for some people. I
*  think there's some people in the country who will look at this as yet another attempt by the feds or
*  Democrats or the deep state to go after Donald Trump. But I want to tell you a story from the
*  courthouse in Miami when I was down there covering the charges against Donald Trump over mishandling
*  classified documents. And I was talking with a man and he was out there because he wanted to see Trump
*  held accountable. And as we were talking, actually tears got in his eyes and he started to cry because
*  he said, this is great what they're doing with the documents case. Like I'm glad they're charging this.
*  But what about when he tried to destroy our democracy? What about when he tried to overthrow
*  what we know America to be as a country? What about that? And I think that's a question on a
*  lot of people's minds. You see these other cases getting charged and you think, well, what about
*  when they stormed the Capitol and what about when he wouldn't leave office?
*  And for a lot of Americans, this is the worst thing Donald Trump did in office, especially a
*  lot of Democrats view it that way. And they want to see him held accountable for what they think
*  was a full throated assault on American democracy.
*  And with this indictment today, for them, that has now happened.
*  Well, Luke, thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  Trump is scheduled to be arraigned on the four charges brought by the special counsel
*  at 4 p.m. on Thursday inside a federal courthouse in Washington.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. In a sign of how Trump's legal problems could hamper
*  his campaign, the Times reports that his political action committee, which began last year with 105
*  million dollars, now has less than 4 million left after paying tens of millions of dollars
*  in legal fees for both Trump and his associates. The committee's finances are so dire that in an
*  unusual move, it has requested a refund for a 60 million dollar donation that it made to a pro-Trump
*  super PAC, which unlike his regular PAC, can spend money to promote his candidacy.
*  The 60 million dollar donation was intended to pay for ads on behalf of Trump. But for now,
*  it seems his legal bills are a bigger priority. And as of Tuesday, American consumers can no
*  longer purchase most incandescent light bulbs, marking the end of a technology first patented
*  by Thomas Edison in the late 1800s. Sales of the bulbs are now banned under new energy efficiency
*  rules, which seek to transition the country to LED bulbs, which require less electricity,
*  last far longer, and as a result, lower the country's emissions of greenhouse gases.
