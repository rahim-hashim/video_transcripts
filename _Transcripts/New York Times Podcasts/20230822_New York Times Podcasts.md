*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernici, and this is The Daily.
*  This extreme summer heat is not just impacting us on the land.
*  The oceans are now hitting dangerously high record-breaking temperatures.
*  A buoy in Manantee Bay recorded temperature of 101.1 degrees.
*  A historic heat wave is warming the waters off the coast of Florida, endangering a critical
*  part of sea life.
*  The coral reef.
*  Scientists predict 70 to 90 percent of coral reefs could die off in the next 30 years.
*  Today, my colleague, Katrin Einhorn, on the urgent quest to save coral, and what it might
*  mean for the world if it disappears.
*  It's Tuesday, August 22.
*  Katrin, thanks for coming on.
*  Good to be here.
*  So, Katrin, we've been hearing these pretty alarming reports of really hot water off
*  the coast of Florida.
*  And it's reached these incredibly high temperatures, like over 100 degrees.
*  And we also know from your reporting that this is very bad for lots of different kinds
*  of sea life, in particular for coral.
*  So tell me what's going on.
*  So yeah, in early July, we started seeing sea surface temperatures in the 90s off the
*  Florida Keys.
*  And that's way earlier than the hottest temperatures should happen, which is August and September.
*  And my beat is biodiversity.
*  So of course, I'm thinking about coral reefs, which are these incredibly important ecosystems.
*  Okay, coral reefs.
*  So tell me about them.
*  Well, when you think of coral, you probably think of these rock-like formations underwater,
*  right?
*  Those are called stony coral.
*  They build these big reefs.
*  They're like underwater forests made from limestone.
*  But they're not rocks.
*  They're actually little animals.
*  On these structures are lots of these tiny little animals.
*  They look like sea anemones.
*  They're called coral polyps.
*  And so these animals are essentially clones of each other.
*  They're all connected.
*  And one colony can have thousands of these polyps.
*  Whoa, crazy.
*  And the way that they sustain themselves is even wilder.
*  They have these little tentacles that they can put out and capture prey.
*  They also have this really cool symbiotic relationship with a kind of algae.
*  The algae live inside the coral tissue and consume their waste.
*  And when the algae photosynthesize, it creates sugar that feed the coral.
*  And they're getting most of their energy, their food essentially, from this algae.
*  So coral is basically a bunch of little animals laid out like a forest in the ocean.
*  And they have this algae inside them.
*  Yeah, they have plant-like algae inside them.
*  And this relationship between the coral and the algae is critical to the coral survival.
*  If the coral don't have algae, they eventually starve to death.
*  And they need really particular conditions for this relationship to thrive,
*  like water that's not too hot.
*  Of course, with climate change comes hot water,
*  and that is a really big problem for coral and in turn, a really big problem for people.
*  Okay, so explain that. How is it a big problem?
*  So these tiny little animals make reefs that cover really a tiny fraction of the entire ocean floor,
*  but they provide outsized benefits to the planet.
*  I mean, the first one is that these reefs they create habitat for fish and other sea animals
*  that use the reefs for shelter and food.
*  And this is the really crazy thing about a quarter of all marine life rely on coral reefs
*  at some point in their life cycle.
*  A quarter of all life in the ocean.
*  It's a huge amount.
*  It's crazy.
*  And people rely on a lot of those fish for protein,
*  particularly in the global south, right?
*  Many communities don't have a lot of other options.
*  And so these coral reefs are feeding people.
*  And beyond that, another really important thing about coral reefs
*  is that they protect coasts from storms.
*  Research shows that reefs break wave energy by an average of 97%.
*  So like say there's a storm, it's whipping up waves.
*  The structure of the coral reef will cause those waves to break before they get to the coast.
*  Got it. So like protecting the coast from this pummeling that waves are bringing.
*  Exactly. Yeah.
*  And then coral generates tourism and supports many economies around the world.
*  And there have been a bunch of estimates to try and figure out like,
*  what is the actual economic value that reefs provide?
*  Like how can we quantify that?
*  And here in the US, it's been estimated they generate 3.4 billion annually
*  in economic benefits. That's a federal estimate.
*  And globally, that number has been estimated at $2.7 trillion.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Which is roughly the size of the GDP of France.
*  That's huge.
*  Okay. So coral is really vital in a lot of ways.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  But coral reefs have really suffered over the last 40 years.
*  We've just seen a massive degradation and loss of reefs and coral cover around the world.
*  And of course that is connected to rising sea temperatures and climate change.
*  And that's what we see in Florida.
*  The Florida reef is the only extensive coral reef system in the continental United States.
*  It's about 350 miles long.
*  It's one of the largest barrier reefs in the world.
*  And it's suffering mightily.
*  And that brings us back to the beginning of our conversation, right?
*  The recent water temperatures off the coast reaching such alarming levels.
*  Right, right.
*  And so when we started seeing these extreme temperatures,
*  we knew it was going to be bad for the reef.
*  But the question was, like, how bad is it now?
*  Like, what's actually happening?
*  And so I started calling scientists and folks in Florida to figure that out.
*  I wish that you could kind of experience what it feels like to be in one of our nurseries.
*  And that led me to Bailey Thomason, who works for the Coral Restoration Foundation,
*  a nonprofit based in the Florida Keys.
*  And part of their work is creating underwater nurseries for coral.
*  Really?
*  I mean, our nurseries create basically like a reef in themselves.
*  They're structure, there's coral, there's so many fish that have made it at home after 70 years and so.
*  And in these nurseries, they implant these structures that look kind of like trees.
*  They sort of have branches.
*  And the coral, the fragments of coral hang off the branches.
*  And they get bigger over time so they can go from like a finger to a basketball size in about six or nine months.
*  And the idea is to eventually transplant these corals onto these really damaged areas of the Florida reef to help restore it.
*  Okay.
*  So when the temperatures really started spiking in July,
*  Bailey went out on a dive to a place called some Brear Reef, which includes two species of coral,
*  Elkorn and Staghorn that are threatened with extinction and particularly vulnerable to hot weather.
*  So Bailey and her team knew that there was this 10-foot wild Elkorn coral structure there and
*  they were going to collect some samples.
*  So we actually went to the Guerrero and we got there, we looked down and I saw a brown coral.
*  And she gets there and at first she just kind of glances at it and she sees that it's brown in color and so she's so relieved.
*  And why is the algae being brown good?
*  Because when coral is healthy, it can have a brownish color, right?
*  It takes on the color of the algae itself.
*  But when the water is too hot, it stresses the coral and the algae that it needs to survive is expelled,
*  which leads to the coral turning white.
*  That's known as bleaching and it's a really bad sign for coral.
*  You know, it means that it's at risk of essentially starving to death.
*  But in this case, the coral was brown.
*  So we were all really excited.
*  But then as she gets closer,
*  she realizes that the brown color is not healthy.
*  Coral tissue.
*  Instead, it's actually dead.
*  Wow.
*  A week before her team had been there and it was in perfect shape.
*  Oh my god.
*  And now it was dead.
*  So we were all really upset.
*  It was just kind of like a, okay, this is maybe what it's going to be.
*  She thought, okay, that one's dead.
*  She keeps going around the reef to try and find another sample that she can take.
*  There was just not a single coral left.
*  You know, we've been storing coral there for over a decade.
*  It's in Verra.
*  And not a single one of those was alive.
*  And it was just all dead.
*  Just got like, oh my god, we're in the apocalypse.
*  What's happening?
*  Yeah, that was a really hard time for us.
*  So the next day, she goes to this other site called Lou Keen Nursery.
*  This has been like her work, baby.
*  She got to create this nursery.
*  You know, I've not brought the team pay.
*  We saw some bad stuff this February yesterday.
*  We might have a couple of trees that have gone.
*  And this nursery she's created now houses a hundred of those man-made trees.
*  And they're full of threatened coral.
*  So we got there.
*  We looked down and we could have already seen the before you even got in.
*  That there was just white coral everywhere.
*  And she's still on the boat and she said she looked down.
*  And she just sees that everything is white.
*  It's all bleached.
*  And she said that her and her team just like had a group hug.
*  And we were like, this is going to suck.
*  This is going to be really, really hard.
*  Especially when we have to do it.
*  Like here they were.
*  Like it was going to be terrible.
*  And they had to go look anyway.
*  All hundred trees were completely bleached.
*  They dive in.
*  It's as bad as they thought.
*  I don't know how to put it other than like,
*  and not to shield her manicure.
*  But it felt like we had a long story.
*  She gets back out of the water and she calls her boss.
*  And he told me that she was crying so hard that he couldn't understand her.
*  Like he thought that there had been some kind of accident.
*  Oh no.
*  She just said we lost everything.
*  And based on everything you said about how truly vital coral is,
*  I understand why she's so upset, right?
*  This is a huge blow.
*  I guess I'm wondering, is this the first time this has happened?
*  No.
*  This is like a slowly mounting catastrophe that scientists have been warning us about for decades, right?
*  So before the very late 70s or early 80s, there were no reports of mass bleaching,
*  which is when there's like widespread coral bleaching.
*  Coral is really sensitive to heat, right?
*  It can't be too hot.
*  It also can't be too cold.
*  And bleaching has often happened locally.
*  That's a thing that a coral can do in its stress.
*  But what's been happening now since the very late 70s or early 80s is these mass bleaching
*  events, which weren't documented before that.
*  And in my lifetime, they've just been growing in severity and frequency.
*  So like for example, in 2005, the US lost about half of its coral cover in the Caribbean in one year.
*  Due to a massive bleaching event.
*  And is this incident worse than ones of the past?
*  The temperatures off the floor to keys this summer were record breaking.
*  And in this case, as we saw at some braero and some other sites in the lower and middle keys,
*  the water was so hot that the coral just died.
*  It didn't even bleach.
*  But scientists don't yet know like what percentage of the coral has bleached or died.
*  There'll be surveys over the next several months to figure that out.
*  But temperatures have remained really high.
*  And typically the worst temperatures of the year come in August and September.
*  So it's not looking good.
*  Well, why is the water so hot right now?
*  There are natural marine heat waves, right?
*  That's a thing that happens.
*  And right now we're going into this El Nino cycle.
*  So that's like a naturally occurring phenomenon that's associated with warmer water.
*  Okay.
*  But the thing is, is we've been burning fossil fuels and tearing down forests
*  and releasing all these greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
*  The ocean has been doing a lot of work for us.
*  The ocean has absorbed 90% 90% of that excess heat.
*  So you take climate change and then you add natural phenomena like El Nino
*  and you get events like this massive marine heat wave.
*  You know, it's been record temperatures for the past month.
*  And for people who have devoted their lives to coral,
*  it's not only really hard for them to reckon with what's happening in the ocean.
*  It's raising really difficult questions about their work.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Katrin, you said that these coral restoration people, they're really worried.
*  What is the plan now?
*  I mean, what are they thinking about the future of their work now that this mass bleaching event,
*  this effectively mass death event has happened?
*  You know, in a lot of ways, their work has never been more important.
*  As temperatures spiked, groups like Coral Restoration Foundation partnered with the federal
*  government to gene bank coral that's at risk of extinction.
*  They wanted samples of all the remaining genetic individuals of El Corn and Staghorn in Florida.
*  God forbid that they were wiped out by this terrible heat wave.
*  Right? So they were racing to get live coral out of the water and into tanks on land.
*  Separately from all this, they've been selectively breeding coral that might end up being
*  more resilient to warm temperatures.
*  But, you know, the whole idea is that they're eventually going to restore Florida's coral reef.
*  And this marine heat wave is making some of them question how possible that is.
*  And one person who's been grappling with this is this guy Ken Needamire,
*  who some people call the Godfather of Coral Restoration in Florida.
*  I know you've been in this for a long time.
*  Like, how did you get into it?
*  I don't know, my own business.
*  Yeah, we had a tropical fish wholesale business we should.
*  So Ken is super interesting because he got into this actually through like a business that he had,
*  which was selling tropical fish.
*  He was a tropical fish wholesaler.
*  Okay.
*  And he would dive and he would actually collect tropical fish to sell.
*  And in the process of doing that, I was watching all the sea urchins dying, the coral bleaching.
*  And I just started realizing there's no future in this if we don't have live coral.
*  And over the years, he just saw the reefs declining and declining.
*  And it got to the point where in 1998, there was this mass bleaching event.
*  And he just thought like, what am I doing?
*  I shouldn't be thinking about taking tropical fish or even coral out of the water
*  and into aquariums.
*  Like, I need to restore it here.
*  I couldn't continue to do what I was doing.
*  I had to do something about it, you know, just so as a big change in life.
*  I mean, I took a huge takeout from what I was doing to what I'm doing.
*  Now, but this is not about money.
*  Now it's about trying to make a difference.
*  So what does Ken do?
*  So Ken actually found the group that Bailey works at now, which is Coral Restoration Foundation.
*  Then he goes on to found another similar group called Reef Renewal.
*  And it's all the things that we talked about, like making these nurseries,
*  growing the coral and nurseries, moving them to the reef.
*  He's also doing gene banking.
*  He's trying some selective breeding to actually try and help when there are corals that do survive
*  these mass bleaching events will breed them together and see if they're harder and more resilient
*  to temperature changes.
*  But really, like, what it all comes down to is providing some kind of life support for the coral
*  to get them through this difficult patch while hopefully the world addresses climate change
*  so that then they can be ready to thrive in the future.
*  Once temperatures are under control, he's like a hospital for coral.
*  Yeah, he's like an ICU for coral.
*  Okay, so Ken is spending his days and nights trying to save coral.
*  What is it that he's thinking about now that this mass bleaching event has happened?
*  Like, what's he thinking about at this moment?
*  Yeah, I asked him.
*  He's really grappling with what it means for him.
*  It's like not such a light question from these days, of course.
*  How are you?
*  Like, how actually are you?
*  I don't know.
*  I've been in the process just
*  I've lived down here for almost 50 years.
*  I've been diving down here since 1969 and I've never seen what we're having right now.
*  I'm just I don't really know how to process it.
*  We are on a scary, scary trajectory on huge amounts of mortality.
*  This is beyond any worst case scenario we remember imagined.
*  So here he is providing all this life support,
*  but the heat keeps getting worse and that's undoing his work.
*  And so it's harder for him to see where all of this is going.
*  You know, I've invested 20 years of my life in this.
*  Not just, you know, this is just my job.
*  This is like an obsession of mine.
*  I'm just like, I don't know how to, I'm not sure what, you know,
*  what are this is all going to go.
*  Kind of.
*  Yeah.
*  I think this is a preview of what it's going to be like, but it's a wake up call.
*  It should be a wake up call to anybody.
*  So Ken has essentially spent his entire life on something that is fundamentally a hopeful act.
*  Right?
*  Saving these things.
*  You know, preserving these magical and crucial organisms.
*  That is an act of hope.
*  Has he lost that sense?
*  I mean, how is he fundamentally understanding what is going on right now?
*  I think he spends a lot of his day in just like go mode because he's still just doing everything
*  he can to salvage what he can and help what he can.
*  He's moving coral into deeper water, nurseries.
*  He's moving it onto land still.
*  But the things that these coral restoration folks need, the rest of the world to do,
*  like aren't happening.
*  Right.
*  There's been so much talk about climate change and what the world needs to do to make things better.
*  But in reality, greenhouse gas emissions in the United States went up last year, not down.
*  And globally emissions were on target to hit a record high.
*  You know, we are on track to exceed two degrees Celsius of warming, which is the point at which
*  scientists expect coral reefs will essentially disappear.
*  Wow.
*  And so scientists are saying the world needs to do a whole lot more.
*  And ultimately, the work that Bailey and Ken are doing relies on the rest of the world
*  to rein in emissions and to stop temperatures from hitting critical points.
*  So they're basically out there saying, look, we're holding our breath trying to get to safety,
*  but you guys keep not bringing safety.
*  Right.
*  We're trying to keep these corals alive while you guys fix this problem.
*  And the world isn't fixing the problem.
*  No, we're near fast enough.
*  Right.
*  And unfortunately, I think a big part of what we're seeing with coral is that to many of us humans,
*  it's hard to see the impact in our everyday lives.
*  I mean, in some ways, that's been the history of climate change.
*  Right.
*  Like the little changes that happen slowly over time are just not something that people actually
*  clock.
*  Right.
*  Scientists have been sounding the alarm on coral reefs for so long.
*  But this degradation that's been happening is really hard to grasp for, you know, people who
*  don't see them every day.
*  Hmm.
*  And, you know, reporting the story made me think of an experience I had as a kid,
*  I went snorkeling with my family at John Pennacamp coral reef state park in the Keys.
*  And I remember being totally transfixed by what I saw there, you know?
*  I mean, it's like anyone knows this who's seen like a beautiful coral reef.
*  It's just like teaming with life.
*  It's this like bright underwater crazy world.
*  And when I thought about this snorkeling trip, I realized that if I went back now,
*  I would not see the same reef.
*  The reef would not be as vibrant as it was when I was there so many years ago.
*  And I wondered like how much it had actually changed.
*  And when I was talking to Ken, I actually asked him because he knows the area so well.
*  Hmm.
*  Like what is kind of Camp Look now?
*  So I'm 45, so that would have been what?
*  35, 25.
*  That would have been like 30 years ago, right?
*  Does it look very different than it would have looked to me 30 years ago?
*  Yeah.
*  You know, it used to be all live coral.
*  There used to be elk, our coral, our stag, our coral, brain coral.
*  Almost all of those were dead and gone.
*  You know, if you had a discerning eye or if you had a before and after picture,
*  you would recognize it.
*  It's changed that much.
*  But to like a lay person who would go in snorkel there,
*  they would still be sort of blown away by the life that they see.
*  They do, and they'll even go there now when the corals are all pleased white.
*  I'll think how beautiful it is.
*  Yeah, because their idea of a coral is a white skeleton that they see in a shell shop or something.
*  So when coral dies, the limestone structures are still in place for some time.
*  There are some coral dependent species that will go away immediately.
*  But there are lots of other species that will still use those limestone structures
*  for habitat.
*  Most people don't notice the subtle changes.
*  They still come down here.
*  The water's clear.
*  There's pretty fish.
*  You know, there's sea fans.
*  There's an occasional coral.
*  So they'll go out there and they'll think, oh, it's so beautiful.
*  And I saw a French angel fish or did you see all the sea fans?
*  I mean, after all these boats, I see it.
*  It's this shifting baseline thing.
*  But when I dive it out here, 50 years ago, I know what it looks like.
*  So people who are snorkeling or diving will see this beautiful marine life.
*  And you know, they may be transfixed by it like I was when I was a kid.
*  Depending on the reef, the average person may not even notice how degraded it is.
*  They may not realize.
*  That's the sad part.
*  Is it we'll just keep going as usual.
*  It's getting a more and more degraded.
*  But they, you know, they're still going to be able to people that come down.
*  They're going to think it's beautiful.
*  And what makes it even worse is that because of the other impacts of climate change,
*  we need these reefs more than ever.
*  Right?
*  Like climate change fuels more intense hurricanes.
*  And we need reefs to protect the coasts.
*  Climate change causes all kinds of havoc with agriculture.
*  And so the food that the reef's nurture becomes even more important, right?
*  So just when we need coral reefs the most,
*  we're making them go away.
*  And that will have really terrible consequences for people.
*  Catrin, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Monday, to my left is the banion tree.
*  Beloved by this community for over 150 years.
*  President Biden visited the scorched remains of the town of Lahaina in Hawaii.
*  His first visit there since wildfires killed more than 100 people on August 8th.
*  Biden met with survivors of the fire, with emergency workers, and with state and local officials.
*  Today is burned, but it's still standing.
*  Tree survive for a reason.
*  I believe it's a powerful, a very powerful symbol of what we can and we'll do to get through this crisis.
*  Standing by a 150-year-old tree, a landmark in Lahaina, he said that while the devastation in
*  the town was, quote, overwhelming, the tree's survival was a symbol of the island's resilience.
*  Officials have searched about 87% of the area affected by the fire, and several hundred people
*  are still unaccounted for.
*  And a judge in Atlanta set bail for former President Donald Trump at $200,000
*  in a sprawling racketeering case against him and 18 associates.
*  The accused will be required to pay cash at the time of their booking, which was not the case
*  in the three other criminal cases involving the former President.
*  Defendants have to come up with just 10% of the bail amount, but even that could prove
*  difficult for some of them, including Rudy Giuliani, the former personal lawyer for Trump,
*  who's running out of money because of an array of legal entanglements.
*  Mr. Trump posted untruth social that he would surrender to the authorities in Atlanta on Thursday.
