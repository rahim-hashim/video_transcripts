# The Republican Attempt to Impeach President Biden
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7xciyEL3w4)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  The Speaker of the House has ordered an impeachment inquiry into President Biden, putting into
*  motion the third formal attempt by Congress to remove a president in the past four years.
*  Today, I spoke with my colleague, Luke Broadwater, about the unique realities behind this one.
*  It's Friday, September 15th.
*  Luke, I want you to walk us through this news conference a few days ago in which Speaker
*  Kevin McCarthy explains this pretty momentous decision to open an impeachment inquiry.
*  Right.
*  Well, the House had just come back from a long August recess and was about to gavel in to
*  start its September session.
*  And Kevin McCarthy calls a snap news conference outside of the Speaker's office, what we call
*  the small rotunda at the Capitol.
*  And he walks out.
*  Welcome back, everyone.
*  He sets somewhat of a somber tone.
*  You know, the months that we were gone in the weeks, House Republicans have uncovered
*  serious and credible allegations into President Biden's conduct.
*  And he begins to lay out why he believes there needs to be an impeachment inquiry into
*  President Biden.
*  Now, here's what we know so far.
*  Through our investigations, we have found that President Biden did lie to the American
*  people about his own knowledge of his family's foreign business dealings.
*  The first thing he says is that President Biden lied about his son, Hunter Biden's
*  business dealings.
*  There is evidence that President Biden made at least one very prominent false statement
*  and that other times he oversimplified or maybe made misstatements when describing the
*  business interactions.
*  Eyewitnesses have testified that the president joined on multiple phone calls and had
*  multiple interactions.
*  But then he makes a series of allegations about conduct that Hunter Biden engaged in and
*  attempts to link it to President Biden.
*  And he does it in a way that is not really backed up to date by any hard or concrete
*  evidence. And that really is the link that has been missing so far for the House
*  Republicans, who through their various committees for months now have, of course, been
*  investigating President Biden and his family.
*  I'll give you one real quick example.
*  Dinners resulted in cars and millions of dollars into his son's and his son's business
*  partners.
*  In McCarthy's speech, he suggests that Biden is responsible for getting his son millions
*  of dollars and fancy cars and things like that.
*  And, you know, Hunter Biden did get expensive gifts and millions of dollars from overseas
*  business interests.
*  What McCarthy is alleging and what Republicans have yet to prove is that it was Joe Biden's
*  intervention that caused those things to happen.
*  All they've uncovered so far is that on occasion, Joe Biden exchanged niceties with
*  business associates of his son, things like chatting about the weather or a handshake.
*  They have not produced any concrete evidence that he was directly involved in any of
*  these business activities himself.
*  But that's the type of thing the Republicans are digging into to try to prove.
*  That's why today I am directing our House committee to open a formal impeachment
*  inquiry into President Joe Biden.
*  He makes clear that he believes these are allegations, that they are not proven, that
*  there is no immediate pending impeachment, but that he believes an impeachment investigation
*  is necessary to get to the bottom of them.
*  We are committed to getting the answers for the American public.
*  Nothing more, nothing less.
*  We will go wherever the evidence takes us.
*  Thank you very much.
*  So in summary, McCarthy is laying out actual evidence of misstatements that President
*  Biden has made while president, perhaps knowingly, perhaps unknowingly about his son
*  Hunter's business dealings.
*  And McCarthy is pairing that with allegations for which there's not really much evidence
*  that Biden was directly involved in those deals back when he was vice president or
*  afterward.
*  So at the heart of this is essentially the claim that before Biden was president, he
*  acted in a corrupt manner.
*  That's exactly right.
*  Most of the allegations stem from a period of time when Joe Biden was vice president,
*  although they are now alleging also that once he becomes president, his administration
*  is engaged in sort of turning a blind eye to these allegations and not investigating
*  fully the case against Hunter Biden.
*  Basically that there's a kind of cover up.
*  Yes, they do alleged cover up without a ton of evidence, but they alleged a cover up.
*  So just to be clear, no new bombshell evidence implicating President Biden has just
*  been revealed.
*  No single smoking gun that explains McCarthy's decision.
*  I mean, everything he has laid out here that we're talking about is familiar and yet
*  it never before merited an impeachment inquiry.
*  That's right. And in fact, the vast majority of the Republican case against Biden has
*  existed for years.
*  I mean, Senate Republicans did a lengthy report in 2020 that has the majority of these
*  allegations in it.
*  Now they have added some new facts and some new evidence in the past year, but it's not
*  something that fundamentally changes the nature of the case.
*  So if there's not super damning new evidence, Luke, help us understand the timing of
*  this. We have known, of course, that Republicans have wanted to impeach President Biden
*  pretty much since the moment he took office.
*  But why right now?
*  Why this week?
*  Sure.
*  No, you're exactly right.
*  From day one of Biden's presidency, some members of Congress have started introducing
*  articles of impeachment against him.
*  They wanted to impeach him over the situation at the border.
*  They've wanted to impeach him over the fentanyl crisis.
*  They wanted to impeach him over the withdrawal from Afghanistan.
*  So there are a number of reasons why they have gone after Biden from the start.
*  And so for most of that time, Kevin McCarthy has tried to hold off the right wing of his
*  party. He says there should be no impeachment for political reasons.
*  He said Republicans should be above that.
*  They should follow a process where evidence is gathered.
*  He's also repeatedly maintained that no impeachment inquiry should be opened without
*  a vote of the full House, that it should have the support of the majority of the body
*  before any impeachment inquiry is ever undertaken.
*  But there's a couple of things you need to understand.
*  One, Kevin McCarthy is clinging to the speakership by the thinnest of margins.
*  Remember, he only became speaker after making a ton of concessions to the hard right.
*  And one of those concessions was agreeing that any one member at any time, if they were
*  dissatisfied with Kevin McCarthy, could call a vote to remove him.
*  Right.
*  And on top of that, remember when we were barreling toward default on our debt and in
*  order to avoid that, McCarthy cut a spending deal with the White House?
*  Yes, I do.
*  Well, the hard right remains really mad at him for that.
*  And we are entering a period now where McCarthy has to make good on that deal and fund the
*  government by the deadline on September 30th.
*  And the hard right is saying, no way, we're not voting for those bills.
*  And they're telling McCarthy the only way he gets their votes and avoids the government
*  shutdown is to make some concessions.
*  And one of those concessions is impeaching President Biden.
*  So these hard right House Republicans are explicitly saying to the speaker over whom
*  they have a tremendous amount of leverage, given their slim majority.
*  We are angry about the spending deal you struck with Joe Biden.
*  We don't like it, but you should know that if you want us to support that kind of a
*  budget, you need to go after Joe Biden with something like impeachment.
*  Yes, that's exactly right.
*  Some of them have made that very explicit and said an impeachment inquiry into Joe
*  Biden was necessary for their vote to keep the government open.
*  Huh?
*  And so those are the real dynamics at play and the great pressures on Kevin McCarthy.
*  But I think the thing that really tips it over the edge is the actions of
*  Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida.
*  Matt Gaetz lets it be known that as soon as the House is back in session, he plans to
*  give a blistering floor speech against Kevin McCarthy in which he is going to demand
*  that Kevin McCarthy come into compliance with the far right or face removal from the
*  speakership.
*  And it's clear that one of the demands Gaetz is planning to make is that McCarthy get a
*  lot tougher on President Biden and his son Hunter.
*  And the clear implication here is that McCarthy better get going with impeachment or
*  he's going to face some real consequences.
*  So there is now a very direct, imminent and specific public threat from Matt Gaetz
*  against McCarthy's future as speaker unless he immediately complies with this request
*  to open an impeachment inquiry.
*  That's correct.
*  And so Kevin McCarthy is faced with this choice either he can keep with a position he's
*  held for a long time that an impeachment inquiry should only be opened with a full vote
*  of the House.
*  At present, he lacks the votes to do that on note, or he can change his position, give
*  in to Matt Gaetz's demand and unilaterally order the impeachment inquiry.
*  And looking at the best way he can try to stay speaker and cling to his speakership,
*  he makes what I think a lot of Republicans believe was the only choice he could make
*  politically.
*  And that is to go ahead, change his position, reverse his previous statements and order
*  an impeachment inquiry to in some ways keep his job.
*  Right.
*  And we know exactly what happens next.
*  McCarthy comes out, delivers this speech announcing that he's going to open this
*  impeachment inquiry, does exactly what he knows Congressman Gaetz wants him to do.
*  Yes.
*  So McCarthy gets ahead of Gaetz.
*  He positions himself as the aggressive actor against President Biden, which is always a
*  good position to be in if you want to appeal to the far right of the Republican Party.
*  But Matt Gaetz doesn't back down.
*  I rise today to serve notice, Mr. Speaker, you are out of compliance with the agreement
*  that allowed you to assume this role.
*  He gives the floor speech anyway.
*  The path forward for the House of Representatives is to either bring you into immediate total
*  compliance or remove you pursuant to a motion to vacate the chair.
*  And he proceeds to lay out all the ways Kevin McCarthy is failing at speaker.
*  But here we are eight months later and we haven't even sent the first subpoena to Hunter
*  Biden. That's how you know that the rushed and somewhat rattled performance you just
*  saw from the speaker isn't real at this point.
*  So he makes clear he was not satisfied with McCarthy's speech.
*  I know that Washington isn't a town where people are known for keeping their word.
*  Well, Speaker McCarthy, I'm here to hold you to yours.
*  So this must have been pretty disappointing for McCarthy because he's called for the
*  impeachment inquiry and Gaetz gives this searing speech anyway.
*  Well, if you look at it from McCarthy's point of view, he thinks he won the day.
*  If you look at all the headlines and the news coverage, it's all about Kevin McCarthy
*  getting tough with Biden, him moving forward with this impeachment.
*  And that is for someone who has to govern the Republican Party in the House and the
*  far right. That's a good day for Kevin McCarthy when he looks tough on Biden.
*  And there is almost no headlines about Matt Gaetz calling for his removal, which in an
*  alternate scenario could have been the news of the day, which would have been the far
*  right pressures McCarthy calls for him to step down.
*  Right. And, Luke, suffice it to say, this is not the normal course by which an
*  impeachment inquiry, this really grave historic decision is opened as basically job
*  security to save your job as House Speaker.
*  Well, it's not just about job security.
*  Remember, he's also doing this to try to avoid a government shutdown.
*  Kevin McCarthy is very interested in making sure it's seen that Republicans can
*  operate a functioning government and not plunge the country into chaos.
*  And so McCarthy may have won the day and he may have staved off the hard right to
*  tractors for some time.
*  But now he's stuck with a unilateral impeachment inquiry, which is something that he
*  never wanted to do in the first place.
*  And now he has to live with that and all the complicated implications that go along
*  with it. We'll be right back.
*  So, Luke, what will the opening of this impeachment inquiry that Speaker McCarthy
*  is now stuck with do and mean exactly?
*  People like Matt Gaetz have wanted this, but precisely why did they want it?
*  What powers in their minds does it give House Republicans looking into Biden that
*  they didn't already have?
*  Well, functionally, it doesn't actually change all that much.
*  You already have three congressional committees investigating President Biden's
*  administration and President Biden's family.
*  They already have subpoena power.
*  But Congress derives its authority from the fact that it's part of the legislative
*  process. And so a traditional congressional investigation really only is valid in the
*  eyes of the courts, in the eyes of the law, if they're actually engaged in some
*  attempt at legislating, rewriting a law, changing a statute, introducing new
*  legislation.
*  Right. But if a committee or committees embark on an impeachment inquiry, they no
*  longer have to come up with legislative reasons for what they're doing.
*  They don't have to try to pretend they're really rewriting the ethics code.
*  Right. They can simply say, we're demanding these documents because we are
*  investigating whether or not the president committed high crimes or misdemeanors.
*  Got it. And so it gives them they believe a better argument in court should some of
*  their actions get challenged by the Biden administration.
*  Got it. Because up until now, they have, if we're being honest, needed to
*  manufacture a legislative reason to look into Hunter Biden and Joe Biden.
*  Perhaps they would argue, we want to strengthen influence peddling laws.
*  So that's why we're looking into Hunter Biden and Joe Biden.
*  But in reality, that's not quite what they were doing.
*  And now that they have an impeachment inquiry, they don't need such an excuse.
*  And they will have greater legal footing for a really aggressive investigation into
*  both. That's correct.
*  Got it. And I'm curious, were these committees running into any legal limitation
*  in their existing investigations of Hunter and Joe Biden?
*  Or was this just House Republicans anticipating that they might run into these problems?
*  Yeah, it's very much the latter.
*  Republicans have not faced a ton of fight from the Biden White House or from banks
*  as they've been trying to get these records.
*  James Comer, who's the chairman of the Oversight Committee, said in the past six
*  months, every single subpoena he has sent out has been complied with 100 percent.
*  So it's not because they've been encountering resistance to date, it's that they believe
*  they will encounter resistance and want to have their strongest argument for demanding
*  the records that they are about to demand.
*  So from what you're saying, opening an impeachment inquiry doesn't fundamentally change
*  these investigations. It gives Republicans more legal confidence in the investigations.
*  But of course, impeachment has another very clear advantage for House Republicans, which
*  is political.
*  Oh, absolutely.
*  It serves a number of purposes for Kevin McCarthy.
*  One, it helps him politically on the Hill.
*  It helps stave off those hard-right Republicans who have been calling for his head.
*  Two, it helps settle a political score.
*  There are a lot of Republicans on the Hill who still are bitter about the impeachments
*  of Donald Trump, particularly the first impeachment, which they argue had thin evidence.
*  That was the impeachment, of course, where Donald Trump was on a phone call with the
*  leader of Ukraine.
*  And the allegation was that he was shaking him down to try to dig up dirt on Joe Biden
*  and withholding aid because of it.
*  Right. And we should say dig up dirt not just on Joe Biden, but on Joe Biden's son, Hunter,
*  and many of the things that Republicans are now trying to look into.
*  Yes, time is a flat circle.
*  It is all coming back around again, but they're still bitter over that.
*  And they've been looking to exact revenge on Joe Biden and the Democrats because of
*  the impeachments of Donald Trump.
*  Three, Kevin McCarthy believes it's effective politically because, you know, Donald Trump
*  is facing four criminal indictments, 91 felony counts on a range of very serious
*  allegations against his conduct while he was president and even before he was president.
*  And they're hoping that an impeachment inquiry will muddy the waters in the minds of voters
*  and create the impression that, well, I don't know who's more corrupt between Joe Biden
*  and Donald Trump. And so it's hard for me to say as a voter.
*  And then the fourth thing, and I think this is what they're holding out hope for, is that
*  as they dig deeper into Joe Biden, as they dig deeper into Hunter Biden, as they turn over
*  more and more stones, that eventually they may in fact find that smoking gun, which to
*  date they have not. Right.
*  And so they're holding out that if they just keep digging, eventually they might get that
*  really damning piece of evidence.
*  Well, to that point, let's talk about where this all now leads or doesn't lead this
*  impeachment inquiry, given the nature of an impeachment inquiry and the realities of
*  this very narrow House Republican majority.
*  Well, functionally for the Hill, an impeachment inquiry can become an all encompassing
*  exercise. It can suck all the air out of the room of anything else this Congress might
*  want to do. And it will become the focus of a lot of media attention and a lot of the
*  work that lawmakers are doing.
*  So it will have an intense effect on the operations of the Hill as long as the impeachment
*  inquiry lasts.
*  Politically, though, there are quite a few Republicans who are dreading bringing this to
*  a vote. Yeah.
*  And I mean, just as evidence of that, Kevin McCarthy does not have the votes right now,
*  even among Republicans to even open an impeachment inquiry.
*  If he put this to a floor vote, there are quite a few Republicans on the Hill who say
*  we haven't seen any hard evidence.
*  Everything we've seen is innuendo and circumstantial evidence.
*  And we're not willing to impeach without something concrete.
*  And so in order to try to convince his full membership to go along with this, he's got
*  to produce better and stronger evidence against the president.
*  Right now, they have 14 Republicans who represent districts that were won by President
*  Biden and forcing those Republicans to vote to impeach the president who won their
*  districts and is popular with their voters.
*  In some people's view, that's a recipe for losing the House.
*  It's a recipe for a very unpopular vote for these Republicans.
*  And in fact, I was talking to Democrats on the Hill just yesterday who believe that this
*  impeachment inquiry will help them with moderate voters.
*  They think that if moderate voters look at the House and they see Republicans clamoring
*  for both a shutdown and a political impeachment of the president, that that only benefits
*  them in 2024.
*  So bottom line, what you're saying is actually getting to a point where House Republicans
*  would vote to impeach President Biden is pretty unpopular among Republicans, particularly
*  the moderate ones trying to hold on to their seats.
*  And they think might actually benefit Democrats.
*  So it doesn't seem like there's a whole lot of enthusiasm for this being anything other
*  than a gesture to appease the Matt Gaetzes of the world.
*  Right. And so time will tell on that.
*  Is it just an investigation that spins its wheels forever and never leads to an actual
*  impeachment vote?
*  It could be. But there's also a belief on the Hill that launching an impeachment inquiry
*  is a bit like jumping out of a plane.
*  Once you're in the air, you're going to hit the ground that at some point after you've
*  investigated enough, you will have to call for the vote and you will have to force this
*  tough vote on the Republicans in the House to see up or down.
*  Are they going to move to impeach President Biden?
*  Right. And in which case they may need to do something that they know inflicts a lot
*  of political damage on themselves.
*  Right. And a lot of Republicans will tell you when they look back at the first Trump
*  impeachment, they believe that they did well when the Democrats moved against Trump on
*  the first impeachment politically, and they don't want to see the same thing happen to
*  them in this House.
*  Well, to that point, Luke, I want to end by asking you to reflect on the reality that
*  we are now enduring our third impeachment process in just a few years.
*  This one, weirdly enough, harkening back to some of the same circumstances as the first
*  impeachment of President Trump, Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, Ukraine.
*  And despite very real differences between these impeachments, it does feel like we are
*  living in a world where impeachment is now viewed much more than I think we ever imagined
*  it would be as an everyday tool of political life.
*  Yes, I think that's very much the case.
*  It used to be that impeachment was reserved only for the rarest of circumstances.
*  And in this Congress, we've seen various Republicans have introduced articles of
*  impeachment against five different members of the Biden administration, the Homeland
*  Security Secretary, the attorney general up and down the line.
*  And we've long ago, I think, left the idea that you had to prove a high crime to start
*  an impeachment inquiry.
*  And we are now in the phase of the impeachment inquiry has enough political
*  benefits on its own, so might as well go ahead and do it.
*  Oh, Luke, thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
*  On Thursday, federal prosecutors charged Hunter Biden with lying about his drug use
*  when he purchased a handgun in 2018 and for illegally possessing the weapon after a plea
*  deal involving those charges collapsed.
*  The charges do not implicate President Biden, whose administration rolled out what the
*  Times described as a long planned strategy for defending itself against the House
*  impeachment inquiry.
*  As part of that strategy, White House officials and their allies dismissed the
*  allegations against the president as baseless and debunked, attacked House Republicans
*  for distorting the evidence and pushed the news media to frame the entire conflict on
*  the president's terms as a naked act of political partisanship.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Thursday evening, with their latest contract set to expire at midnight, members of
*  the nation's largest union of auto workers were preparing to begin a strike today
*  against the three Detroit automakers, Ford, General Motors and Stellantis.
*  The union said that the strike would likely begin with limited walkouts at specific
*  auto plants in an attempt to disrupt carmakers production while still allowing most
*  workers to keep collecting a paycheck.
*  Negotiations between the union and the carmakers have made little progress.
*  The union has demanded 40 percent pay increases, arguing that the pay for the
*  automakers CEOs has risen by the same amount over the past few years.
