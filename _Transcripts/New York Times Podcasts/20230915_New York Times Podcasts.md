*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Borrow. This is The Daily.
*  The Speaker of the House has ordered an impeachment inquiry into President Biden, putting
*  into motion the third formal attempt by Congress to remove a president in the past four years.
*  Today, I spoke with my colleague Luke Broadwater about the unique realities behind this one.
*  It's Friday, September 15th.
*  Luke, I want you to walk us through this news conference a few days ago in which Speaker
*  Kevin McCarthy explains this pretty momentous decision to open an impeachment inquiry.
*  Right. Well, the House had just come back from a long August recess and was about to
*  gavolin to start its September session. And Kevin McCarthy calls a snap news conference
*  outside of the Speaker's office what we call the small rotunda at the Capitol. And he
*  walks out. Welcome back, everyone.
*  He sets somewhat of a somber tone. You know, the months that we were gone in the weeks,
*  House Republicans have uncovered serious and credible allegations into President Biden's
*  conduct. And he begins to lay out why he believes there needs to be an impeachment inquiry
*  into President Biden. Now, here's what we know so far. Through our investigations, we have
*  found that President Biden did lie to the American people about his own knowledge of his
*  family's foreign business dealings. The first thing he says is that President Biden lied
*  about his son Hunter Biden's business dealings. There is evidence that President Biden made
*  at least one very prominent false statement and that other times he oversimplified or maybe
*  made misstatements when describing the business interactions. I witnesses have testified
*  that the President joined on multiple phone calls and had multiple interactions. But
*  then he makes a series of allegations about conduct that Hunter Biden engaged in and
*  attempts to link it to President Biden. And he doesn't in a way that is not really
*  backed up to date by any hard or concrete evidence. And that really is the link that has
*  been missing so far for the House Republicans who through their various committees for months
*  now have of course been investigating President Biden and his family. I'll give you one real
*  quick example. Dinners resulted in cars and millions of dollars into his sons and his
*  sons business partners. In McCarthy's speech he suggests that Biden is responsible for
*  getting his son millions of dollars and fancy cars and things like that. And you know,
*  Hunter Biden did get expensive gifts and millions of dollars from overseas business interests.
*  What McCarthy is alleging and what Republicans have yet to prove is that it was Joe Biden's
*  intervention that caused those things to happen. All they've uncovered so far is that on
*  occasion Joe Biden exchanged niceties with business associates of his son, things like
*  chatting about the weather or a handshake. They have not produced any concrete evidence
*  that he was directly involved in any of these business activities himself. But that's
*  the type of thing the Republicans are digging into to try to prove. That's why today I am directing
*  our House Committee to open a formal impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. He makes clear
*  that he believes these are allegations that they are not proven that there is no immediate
*  pending impeachment, but that he believes an impeachment investigation is necessary to
*  get to the bottom of them. We are committed to getting the answers for the American public.
*  Nothing more, nothing less. We will go wherever the evidence takes us. Thank you very much.
*  So in summary McCarthy is laying out actual evidence of misstatements that President Biden
*  has made while President, perhaps knowingly, perhaps unknowingly about his son, Hunter's
*  business dealings. And McCarthy is pairing that with allegations for which there's not
*  really much evidence that Biden was directly involved in those deals back when he was vice
*  president or afterward. So at the heart of this is essentially the claim that before Biden
*  was president, he acted in a corrupt manner. That's exactly right. Most of the allegations
*  stem from a period of time when Joe Biden was vice president, although they are now alleging
*  also that once he becomes president, his administration is engaged in sort of turning a blind
*  eye to these allegations and not investigating fully the case against Hunter Biden.
*  Basically that there's a kind of cover up. Yes, they do a ledger cover up without a ton
*  of evidence, but they alleged to cover up. So just to be clear, no new bombshell evidence
*  implicating President Biden has just been revealed. No single smoking gun that explains
*  McCarthy's decision. I mean, everything he has laid out here that we're talking about
*  is familiar and yet it never before merited an impeachment inquiry. That's right. And
*  in fact, the vast majority of the Republican case against Biden has existed for years.
*  I mean, Senate Republicans did a lengthy report in 2020 that has the majority of these allegations
*  in it. Now they have added some new facts and some new evidence in the past year, but
*  it's not something that fundamentally changes the nature of the case.
*  So if there's not super damning new evidence, Luke help us understand the timing of this.
*  We have known, of course, that Republicans have wanted to impeach President Biden pretty
*  much since the moment he took office, but why right now? Why this week?
*  Sure. No, you're exactly right. From day one of Biden's presidency, some members of
*  Congress have started introducing articles on impeachment against him. They've wanted
*  to impeach him over the situation at the border. They've wanted to impeach him over the
*  fentanyl crisis. They've wanted to impeach him over the withdrawal from Afghanistan. So
*  there are a number of reasons why they have gone after Biden from the start. And so for
*  most of that time, Kevin McCarthy has tried to hold off the right wing of his party.
*  He says there should be no impeachment for political reasons. He said Republicans should
*  be above that. They should follow a process where evidence is gathered. He's also repeatedly
*  maintained that no impeachment inquiry should be opened without a vote of the full house.
*  That it should have the support of the majority of the body before any impeachment inquiry
*  is ever undertaken. But there's a couple of things you need to understand. One, Kevin McCarthy
*  is clinging to the speakership by the thinnest of margins. Remember, he only became speaker
*  after making a ton of concessions to the hard right. And one of those concessions was agreeing
*  that any one member at any time, if they were dissatisfied with Kevin McCarthy, could call
*  a vote to remove him. Right. And on top of that, remember when we were barreling toward
*  default on our debt and in order to avoid that McCarthy cut a spending deal with the White
*  House? Yes. I do. Well, the hard right remains really mad at him for that.
*  And we are entering a period now where McCarthy has to make good on that deal and fund the
*  government by the deadline on September 30th. And the hard right is saying, no way we're
*  not voting for those bills. And they're telling McCarthy the only way he gets their votes
*  and avoids the government shutdown is to make some concessions. And one of those concessions
*  is impeaching President Biden. So these hard right house Republicans are explicitly
*  saying to the speaker over whom they have a tremendous amount of leverage given their
*  slim majority. We are angry about the spending deal you struck with Joe Biden. We don't like
*  it. But you should know that if you want us to support that kind of a budget, you need
*  to go after Joe Biden with something like impeachment. Yes, that's exactly right. Some
*  of them have made that very explicit and said that impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden was
*  necessary for their vote to keep the government open. And so those are the real dynamics at
*  play and the great pressures on Kevin McCarthy. But I think the thing that really tips it
*  over the edge is the actions of Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida. Matt Gaetz lets it be
*  known that as soon as the house is back in session, he plans to give a blistering floor
*  speech against Kevin McCarthy in which he is going to demand that Kevin McCarthy come into
*  compliance with the far right or face removal from the speaker ship. And it's clear that
*  one of the demands Gaetz is planning to make is that McCarthy get a lot tougher on President
*  Biden and his son Hunter. And the clear implication here is that McCarthy better get going
*  with impeachment or he's going to face some real consequences. So there is now a very direct
*  imminent and specific public threat from Matt Gaetz against McCarthy's future as speaker
*  unless he immediately complies with this request to open an impeachment inquiry.
*  That's correct. And so Kevin McCarthy is faced with this choice. Either he can keep with a position
*  he's held for a long time that an impeachment inquiry should only be opened with a full vote of
*  the House. At present, he lacks the votes to do that on note. Or he can change his position,
*  given to Matt Gaetz's demand and unilaterally order the impeachment inquiry. And looking at
*  the best way he can try to stay speaker and cling to his speaker ship, he makes what I think a
*  lot of Republicans believe was the only choice he could make politically. And that is to go ahead,
*  change his position, reverse his previous statements and order an impeachment inquiry to in some ways
*  keep his job. Right. And we know exactly what happens next McCarthy comes out, delivers this speech
*  announcing that he's going to open this impeachment inquiry does exactly what he knows Congressman
*  Gaetz wants him to do. Yes. So McCarthy gets ahead of Gaetz. He positions himself as the aggressive
*  actor against President Biden, which is always a good position to be in if you want to appeal to the
*  far right of the Republican Party. But Matt Gaetz doesn't back down. I rise today to serve notice.
*  Mr. Speaker, you are out of compliance with the agreement that allowed you to assume this role.
*  He gives the floor speech anyway. The path forward for the House of Representatives is to either
*  bring you into immediate total compliance or remove you, pursuant to emotion to vacate the chair.
*  And he proceeds to lay out all the ways Kevin McCarthy is failing at Speaker. But here we are
*  eight months later and we haven't even sent the first subpoena to Hunter Biden. That's how you know
*  that the rushed and somewhat rattled performance you just saw from the Speaker isn't real.
*  At this point during the time of the House. So he makes clear he was not satisfied with McCarthy's speech.
*  I know that Washington isn't a town where people are known for keeping their word.
*  Will Speaker McCarthy? I'm here to hold you to yours.
*  So this must have been pretty disappointing for McCarthy because his call for the impeachment
*  inquiry in Gaetz gives this searing speech anyway. Well, if you look at it from McCarthy's point of
*  view, he thinks he won the day. If you look at all the headlines and the news coverage, it's all
*  about Kevin McCarthy getting tough with Biden. Him moving forward with this impeachment. And that is
*  for someone who has to govern the Republican Party in the House and the far right. That's a good
*  day for Kevin McCarthy when he looks tough on Biden. And there's almost no headlines about Matt Gaetz
*  calling for his removal, which in an alternate scenario could have been the news of the day, which
*  would have been the far right. Precious McCarthy calls for him to step down.
*  Right. And Luke suffice it to say this is not the normal course by which an impeachment inquiry.
*  This really grave historic decision is opened as basically job security to save your job as House Speaker.
*  Well, it's not just about job security. Remember, he's also doing this to try to avoid a government
*  shutdown. Kevin McCarthy is very interested in making sure it's seen that Republicans can operate a
*  functioning government and not plunge the country into chaos. And so McCarthy may have won the day
*  and he may have staved off the hard right detractors for some time. But now he's stuck with a
*  utilateral impeachment inquiry, which is something that he never wanted to do in the first place.
*  And now he has to live with that and all the complicated implications that go along with it.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So look, what will the opening of this impeachment inquiry that Speaker McCarthy is now stuck with
*  due and mean exactly. People like MacGates have wanted this, but precisely why do they want it?
*  What powers in their minds does it give House Republicans looking into Biden that they didn't already have?
*  Well, functionally, it doesn't actually change all that much. You already have three congressional
*  committees investigating President Biden's administration and President Biden's family. They already
*  have subpoena power, but Congress derives its authority from the fact that it's part of the
*  legislative process. And so a traditional congressional investigation really only is valid in the
*  eyes of the courts and the eyes of the law. If they're actually engaged in some attempt at legislating,
*  rewriting a law, changing a statute, introducing new legislation. But if a committee or committees
*  embark on an impeachment inquiry, they no longer have to come up with legislative reasons for
*  what they're doing. They don't have to try to pretend they're really rewriting the ethics code,
*  right? They can simply say we're demanding these documents because we are investigating whether or
*  not the president committed high crimes or misdemeanors. And so it gives them, they believe a better
*  argument in court should some of their actions get challenged by the Biden administration.
*  Got it. Because up until now they have, if we're being honest, needed to manufacture a legislative
*  reason to look into Hunter Biden and Joe Biden. Perhaps they would argue we want to strengthen
*  influence peddling laws. So that's why we're looking into Hunter Biden and Joe Biden. But in reality,
*  that's not quite what they were doing. And now that they have an impeachment inquiry,
*  they don't need such an excuse and they will have greater legal footing for a really aggressive
*  investigation into both. That's correct. Got it. And I'm curious, were these committees running
*  into any legal limitation in their existing investigations of Hunter and Joe Biden? Or was this
*  just House Republicans anticipating that they might run into these problems? Yeah, it's very much
*  the latter. Republicans have not faced a ton of fight from the Biden White House or from banks
*  as they've been trying to get these records. James Comer, who's the chairman of the Oversight Committee
*  said in the past six months, every single subpoena he has sent out has been complied with 100%.
*  So it's not because they've been encountering resistance to date, is that they believe they will
*  encounter resistance and want to have their strongest argument for demanding the records that
*  they are about to demand. So from what you're saying, opening an impeachment inquiry doesn't
*  fundamentally change these investigations. It gives Republicans more legal confidence in the
*  investigations. But of course, impeachment has another very clear advantage for House Republicans,
*  which is political. Oh, absolutely. It serves a number of purposes for Kevin McCarthy. One,
*  it helps him politically on the hill. It helps stave off those hard right Republicans who have
*  been calling for his head. Two, it helps settle a political score. There are a lot of Republicans on
*  the hill who still are bitter about the impeachment of Donald Trump, particularly the first impeachment,
*  which they argue had thin evidence. That was the impeachment, of course, where Donald Trump was on
*  a phone call with the leader of Ukraine. And the allegation was that he was shaking him down to try
*  to dig up dirt on Joe Biden and withholding aid because of it. Right. And we should say dig up dirt,
*  not just on Joe Biden, but on Joe Biden's son Hunter. And many of the things that Republicans are
*  now trying to look into. Yes, time is a flat circle. It is all coming back around again. But
*  they're still bitter over that. And they've been looking to exact revenge on Joe Biden and the
*  Democrats because of the impeachment of Donald Trump. Three, Kevin McCarthy believes it's effective
*  politically because, you know, Donald Trump is facing four criminal indictments, 91 felony counts
*  on a range of very serious allegations against his conduct while he was president. And even before
*  he was president. And they're hoping that an impeachment inquiry will muddy the waters in the
*  minds of voters and create the impression that, well, I don't know who's more corrupt between Joe Biden
*  and Donald Trump. And so it's hard for me to say as a voter. And then the fourth thing, and I think,
*  you know, this is what they're holding out hope for, is that as they dig deeper into Joe Biden,
*  as they dig deeper into Hunter Biden, as they turn over more and more stones, that eventually they
*  may in fact find that smoking gun, which to date they have not. Right. And so they're holding out
*  that if they just keep digging, eventually they might get that really damning piece of evidence.
*  Well, to that point, let's talk about where this all now leads or doesn't lead this impeachment
*  inquiry, given the nature of an impeachment inquiry and the realities of this very narrow house
*  Republican majority. Well, functionally for the Hill, an impeachment inquiry can become an
*  all encompassing exercise. It can suck all the air out of the room of anything else this Congress
*  might want to do. And it will become the focus of a lot of media attention and a lot of the work
*  that lawmakers are doing. So it will have an intense effect on the operations of the Hill as long
*  as the impeachment inquiry lasts. Politically, though, there are quite a few Republicans
*  who are dreading bringing this to a vote. Yeah. And I mean, just as evidence of that, Kevin McCarthy
*  does not have the votes right now, even among Republicans, to even open an impeachment inquiry.
*  If he put this to a floor vote, there are quite a few Republicans on the Hill who say we haven't
*  seen any hard evidence. Everything we've seen is in you endo and circumstantial evidence.
*  And we're not willing to impeach without something concrete. And so in order to try to convince his
*  full membership to go along with this, he's got to produce better and stronger evidence against
*  the president. Right now, they have 14 Republicans who represent districts that were one by President
*  Biden and forcing those Republicans to vote to impeach the president who won their districts
*  and as popular with their voters. In some people's view, that's a recipe for losing the House,
*  as a recipe for a very unpopular vote for these Republicans. And in fact, I was talking to Democrats
*  on the Hill just yesterday who believe that this impeachment inquiry will help them with moderate
*  voters. They think that if moderate voters look at the House and they see Republicans clamoring for
*  both a shutdown and a political impeachment of the president, that that only benefits them in 2024.
*  So bottom line, what you're saying is actually getting to a point where House Republicans would vote
*  to impeach president Biden is pretty unpopular among Republicans, particularly the moderate ones,
*  trying to hold on to their seats. And they think might actually benefit Democrats. So
*  doesn't seem like there's a whole lot of enthusiasm for this being anything other than a gesture
*  to appease the Matt Gaetz is of the world. Right. And so time will tell on that, is it just an
*  investigation that spins its wheels forever and never leads to an actual impeachment vote?
*  It could be, but there's also a belief on the Hill that launching an impeachment inquiry
*  is a bit like jumping out of a plane. Once you're in the air, you're going to hit the ground.
*  That at some point, after you've investigated enough, you will have to call for the vote and you
*  have to force this tough vote on the Republicans in the House to see up or down, are they going to
*  move to impeach president Biden? Right. And in which case, they may need to do something that they
*  know inflicts a lot of political damage on themselves. Right. And a lot of Republicans will tell you
*  when they look back at the first Trump impeachment, they believe that they did well when the Democrats
*  moved against Trump on the first impeachment politically. And they don't want to see the same thing
*  happen to them in this House. Well, to that point, Luke, I want to end by asking you to reflect
*  on the reality that we are now enduring our third impeachment process in just a few years.
*  This one, weirdly enough, harkening back to some of the same circumstances as the first impeachment
*  of President Trump, Pundra Biden, Joe Biden, Ukraine. And despite very real differences between
*  these impeachments, it does feel like we are living in a world where impeachment is now viewed
*  much more than I think we ever imagined it would be as an everyday tool of political life.
*  Yes, I think that's very much the case. It used to be that impeach was reserved only for the
*  rarest of circumstances. And in this Congress, we've seen various Republicans have introduced
*  articles of impeachment against five different members of the Biden administration, the Homeland,
*  Security Secretary, the Attorney General up and down the line. And we've long ago, I think, left
*  the idea that you had to prove a high crime to start an impeachment inquiry. And we are now in the
*  phase of the impeachment inquiry has enough political benefits on its own. So might as well go ahead and do it.
*  Oh, Luke, thank you very much. Thank you.
*  On Thursday, federal prosecutors charged Hunter Biden with lying about his drug use when he
*  purchased a handgun in 2018 and for illegally possessing the weapon after a plea deal involving
*  those charges collapsed. The charges do not implicate President Biden, whose administration
*  rolled out what the Times described as a long plan strategy for defending itself against the House
*  impeachment inquiry. As part of that strategy, White House officials and their allies dismiss the
*  allegations against the president as baseless and debunked, attacked House Republicans for distorting
*  the evidence and pushed the news media to frame the entire conflict on the president's terms
*  as a naked act of political partisanship.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. On Thursday evening, with their latest contract set to
*  expire at midnight, members of the nation's largest union of auto workers or preparing to begin
*  a strike today against the three Detroit automakers Ford, General Motors and Stellantis.
*  The union said that the strike would likely begin with limited walkouts at specific auto plants
*  in an attempt to disrupt car makers production while still allowing most workers to keep collecting
*  a paycheck. Negotiations between the union and the car makers have made little progress.
*  The union has demanded 40% pay increases arguing that the pay for the automakers CEOs
*  has risen by the same amount over the past few years.
