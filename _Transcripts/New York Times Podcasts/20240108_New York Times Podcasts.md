# The Wild World of Money in College Football
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztczFpub0Jk)
*  From the New York Times, this is The Daily.
*  I'm Natalie Ketroweth, in for Sabrina Tavernisi.
*  Tonight millions of Americans will tune in to watch one of the biggest sports events
*  of the year, college football's national championship game.
*  On the field, the game will be determined by the skill of the players and coaches, but
*  behind the scenes, secretive groups of donors are wielding enormous influence over what
*  fans will see.
*  Today, my colleague David Ferenthold, on the shadowy industry of ending college football,
*  and how it's brought amateur athletics even closer to the world of professional sports.
*  It's Monday, January 8th.
*  David, hi.
*  Hi, Natalie.
*  It's nice to be here.
*  So you're an investigative reporter at the New York Times, and recently you've been looking
*  into the world of college sports.
*  Tell me why.
*  Well, college sports is, to me, a fascinating subject because there's so much money involved
*  here.
*  I have a sense that college sports is amateur athletics, but the amounts of money brought
*  in to these college football programs, particularly, are in the billions of dollars.
*  I'm an investigative reporter covering nonprofits.
*  Obviously, colleges are nonprofits, so it's one of the biggest businesses that nonprofits
*  carry out, and there's also a personal connection for me.
*  I'm a huge college sports fan, and the team I follow is the University of Texas Longhorns.
*  I've been a fan of UT since I was a little kid.
*  So the way I got into this story was, late 2021, I saw a press release from a group
*  at the University of Texas supporting Longhorns, and it was a charity.
*  It was a nonprofit, the topic that I had just gotten interested in writing about.
*  And this charity was doing something really odd, something I'd never seen before.
*  They were saying, the reason our charity exists is to pay offensive linemen at the University
*  of Texas, to pay football players.
*  Particularly, they were saying, we're going to pay every offensive lineman on the University
*  of Texas team $50,000 a year.
*  And all you have to do to get the money is to be on the team, to be academically eligible
*  to play.
*  Now, that struck me, I mean, as a UT fan, great, I'm glad, whatever it takes to get
*  better offensive linemen.
*  But as a nonprofit reporter, that struck me really strangely because, you know, that's
*  not what charities do.
*  Charities don't pay offensive linemen.
*  And I was struggling to figure out how they're squaring their mission of helping the public
*  good with their apparent goal of helping the University of Texas win football games.
*  So I started looking into this, and what I found was that this University of Texas group
*  was one of more than 100 groups that were doing similar things at schools all around
*  the country, using cash from donors to pay athletes and to attract athletes to their
*  school to keep them when they were already there.
*  And that what I also found was that those payments were kind of in a way that maybe
*  not be obvious to the average fan, and definitely not obvious to the casual fan, were reshaping
*  the power dynamics, the rules, the very sort of essence of big time college football.
*  How so?
*  Tell me more about that.
*  Well, we all know that college sports is an amateur game.
*  You can't be paid for playing the game.
*  That was the hallmark of college sports for decades, and it was strictly policed by the
*  NCAA, the organization that sort of oversees big time college sports.
*  The consequences for paying players under the table could be very high.
*  Southern Methodist University famously got what they called the death penalty.
*  Their football team was shut down for a year because their boosters were paying players
*  back in the 80s, and it took them 30 years to recover.
*  So officially, even though many of these schools were benefiting financially from college sports,
*  there was this red line that none of that money was supposed to go to student athletes.
*  That's right.
*  Hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars flowing into these schools collectively
*  from TV deals, from ticket sales, and it finds all these other channels.
*  Coaches get paid tens of millions of dollars a year, and the money would get filtered to
*  players in a way in that they would get scholarships and they would get a nice dorm to live in,
*  very nice athletic facilities.
*  But the players did not get paid.
*  That was both the rule and also sort of the moral heart of college sports for so long
*  was this is an amateur game.
*  But then in 2021, it's being called a game changer for college athletes.
*  That system changed drastically.
*  You're going to have quarterbacks and point guards and pitchers making thousands, if not
*  hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars.
*  Now, this was a change that the NCAA didn't want.
*  It was forced on the NCAA in part by state legislatures.
*  Student athletes in Missouri are one signature away from making a profit off their name and likeness.
*  Which had started the past laws saying that athletes in their state should be able to
*  make endorsements to get paid.
*  Today the Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether the NCAA has the authority.
*  There was also a Supreme Court case.
*  The schools are conspiring to pay no salaries to the workers who are making the schools
*  billions of dollars.
*  In which the justices ruled unanimously against the NCAA, against its ability to control what
*  athletes receive as compensation.
*  Name, image and likeness.
*  It's revolutionizing college sports.
*  The result was something called the NIL, name, image and likeness rules, which the NCAA put
*  in place again under duress in the summer of 2021.
*  Right.
*  This was a huge deal at the time.
*  If I remember correctly, the expectation was that the players, the students, would be able
*  to make money from brand sponsorships and things like that, capitalize on their fame.
*  But they couldn't be treated like employees who were making a salary.
*  That's right.
*  That was very, very important to the NCAA.
*  Both because the schools don't want to part with any of the huge amount of money they
*  were making off college sports.
*  But also because if you treat them as employees, there's a whole bunch of other things that
*  cascade from that.
*  The control that universities have over players in this current system, where they're just
*  student athletes and not employees, would be eroded if they were basically professional
*  athletes.
*  Think how much more rights and power a professional football player has than a college football
*  player has.
*  The NCAA did not want to usher in that system.
*  So David, were there rules around this sponsorship money?
*  Yes.
*  Most importantly, there was a rule that said nothing about the payments anybody makes
*  to players can be conditioned on them playing at all or on them playing well.
*  And the second thing was you can't use these payments, these NIL payments, to recruit players,
*  either to recruit high schoolers or to recruit people from other schools to your school.
*  Those were the guidelines the NCAA set.
*  But almost immediately after these rules come into effect, wealthy boosters, rich folks
*  who support these teams, see a loophole.
*  They see an opening for themselves.
*  They start these things called collectives, which are groups that are not legally affiliated
*  with the schools they support, but they exist to support a specific school's athletic programs.
*  And what they do is pool money from rich donors, and it can be millions of dollars, and they
*  pay athletes for the rights to their name, in some cases for the athletes to do charity
*  work, make an appearance at the Boys and Girls Club, to appear at another charity's gala,
*  to post about charity on social media.
*  But often these charities pay way more than an actual charity would pay for this.
*  I talked to somebody who was at Michigan State, and he paid somebody $750,000 a year, a football
*  player, and the charity work that person did in return was to make one social media post
*  a month.
*  Well, they're paying athletes often who don't have much of an endorsement value, people
*  who are really valuable to their own team, like an offensive lineman or a fullback, they're
*  paying that person according to their value to the team, not according to their endorsement
*  value.
*  So this is not a person you would ever buy Gatorade from.
*  You'd have never heard this person's name, but the team needs them.
*  And a lot of these groups organize themselves as tax-exempt charities.
*  They get approval from the IRS.
*  So that means that their donations from donors are tax deductible.
*  It's a double benefit.
*  get blind backer you want and you get a tax deduction.
*  Wow.
*  So you have these collectives, these outside groups that are theoretically not attached
*  to the universities, and they are ostensibly paying for charitable work.
*  But really, this is all just a cover for recruitment for these teams.
*  What's the weird thing about this system is that, yes, the things that they are specifically
*  prohibited from doing, paying players to play, coordinating with schools to make sure they
*  get the players the schools want, and recruiting players with money, those three things which
*  you're not allowed to do, those are the reasons you have a collective.
*  Those are the things that collective is built to do.
*  Those are the functions of a collective, truly.
*  So all the things that they're doing, that they're designed to do, that they're gathering
*  money from donors to do, are the things that theoretically they're not allowed to do.
*  And so you have this weird flowering of a system with a gigantic wink and a nod that
*  is doing for every school what the NCAA says shouldn't happen in any school.
*  Can you give me an example of how this actually works?
*  Well, a great example is that University of Texas collective I was talking about, Horns
*  with Heart.
*  People who are not University of Texas fans like me may not know, but 2021 was a bad year
*  for the Texas Longhorns.
*  They are a proud program.
*  They've had some great national championships, but they were at a low ebb at that point.
*  They had a losing season, which was rare for them.
*  They lost six games in a row at one point for the first time since the 50s.
*  The season has ended.
*  They're not going to a bowl game.
*  Everybody in Austin is depressed.
*  Things were bad.
*  And the coach has an answer.
*  He says, we need linemen.
*  We need the big blockers up front who will give the quarterback time to throw, who will
*  give the running back room to run.
*  We need bigger humans.
*  And so that's when this collective comes in with its promise to pay $50,000 to any lineman
*  who plays at the University of Texas.
*  And it works.
*  I talked recently to a number of linemen who are at the University of Texas now.
*  One example, this guy Cameron Williams.
*  He is six foot five, 370 pounds, huge prospect coming out of high school in Dallas.
*  He had committed already to a different school.
*  He committed to Oregon to play for the Oregon Ducks.
*  This promise comes out.
*  He decommits from Oregon and commits to University of Texas a week later.
*  And what he told me was, look, I come from a family without much money.
*  This was a chance for me to get $50,000 and help my family right away.
*  I don't have to wait four years and hope I make the NFL draft.
*  I could help my family right now.
*  So why wouldn't I do it?
*  So that off season, Texas had wanted five good offensive linemen.
*  They got seven with the help of this collective, with the help of this offer, $50,000.
*  And it starts a rebuilding program that takes Texas from that really low ebb to where they
*  were this year, which is they had a spot in the college football semifinals.
*  They were one of the last four teams standing.
*  Now they lost to Washington at the very end of the great game.
*  But that collective, the promise they made, the linemen they brought in, took them from
*  a pretty low ebb back to almost the top of college football.
*  So that's a sign of the potential these collectives have for even well-established programs like
*  Texas.
*  It's kind of amazing, David, in this example you're giving.
*  You see in real time how this money affects the makeup of college sports.
*  You have a kid openly, you know, switching schools because of the offer.
*  I mean, you see these collectives at work recruiting players that teams are specifically
*  saying they need to win.
*  That's right.
*  I don't want to be naive.
*  Obviously in the past there were times when boosters would pay off players maybe to switch
*  schools or maybe to come to their school.
*  But there's a difference here.
*  It's in a press release.
*  This is above the board.
*  And so the potential number of people who could be swayed by this is so much bigger.
*  And so what Texas does sets a model that other people immediately start to follow.
*  They look around and say, hey, you know, we need linemen and we got rich donors.
*  Let's put those two together.
*  So you start to see this proliferation of collectives all over the country.
*  We've now counted more than 140 at all kinds of different schools that start following
*  Texas's model and that they're raising tons of money and offering it to players, many
*  of them also copying Texas's model and that they're doing it through a tax-exempt charity.
*  And you start to see that bulwark of college sports, amateurism, the idea that players
*  do it because they love to play or they do it because of the academics, not because they're
*  getting paid, that starts to crumble almost immediately after the NIL system came into
*  place.
*  How is all of this affecting the players?
*  I mean, they must be pretty happy about all this.
*  Extremely.
*  Let's have the NIL now is such a great thing.
*  I mean, it just benefits guys, especially guys that might not do as well on the next
*  level or, you know, have like career injuries because this game, you could be hurt, your
*  career could be over at any given time, you know, so it's a blessing for all of us to
*  be in this time where we're able to get paid.
*  When we talk to players, they're very happy to get, you know, a little tiny piece.
*  And let's face it, it is still a little tiny piece of the huge amount of money that their
*  labor generates.
*  NIL has really helped me, you know, put me in a position to where I can take care of
*  my family and where I can help out and stretch my hand out when I'm able to.
*  When we talk to players, we were asking them in the lead up to the semifinal games last
*  week, you know, what did you use this money for?
*  And the answers we heard were often.
*  Take care of my daughter, pay for daycare every week, be able to buy her the nice things
*  for Christmas, be able to help out when she needs a flight to come see me.
*  You know, I paid for my family to come up and see a game.
*  I paid my family's bills.
*  Me growing up, I really didn't have money.
*  So like the 50,000, it was just like amazing.
*  It was just like shocking me.
*  Cameron Williams, University of Texas lineman that came to Texas after seeing that offer
*  of $50,000, she says,
*  Send my mom some money whenever she needs it.
*  Really?
*  Feel good.
*  Wish I got her, bought her a cell phone.
*  She must have been like so, I mean, so happy.
*  Her first cell phone.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Players were often thrilled to be able to provide something for their families that
*  they wouldn't have unless they'd gone pro.
*  And you know, for a lot of these guys, even the good ones, that's still an if and not
*  a win.
*  So it sounds like the schools are obviously benefiting from this system.
*  The donors are also benefiting because they can take credit for rebuilding their team
*  of choice.
*  And the players are too.
*  Everyone is kind of winning.
*  Yeah, on the surface, it does sound like a lot of people are benefiting.
*  But you have to remember what we're talking about here is basically an unregulated black
*  market for labor.
*  And there's a lot of downsides that come with that, including that the system may be unsustainable
*  and parts of it may be illegal.
*  We'll be right back.
*  David, you've walked us through how these collectives have sort of supercharged paying
*  players in college sports.
*  But even though players are getting windfalls of in some cases, life changing amounts of
*  money, there are also downsides.
*  Tell me about them.
*  Yeah, the players are just really exposed because as I said, they're basically in an
*  unregulated black market.
*  They're getting paid by people who are not really their employers for doing a job.
*  It's not really the job they're doing.
*  There's not that many protections if they get injured, the collective could stop paying
*  them.
*  In some cases, collectives have made promises to players, signed contracts and then not
*  fulfilled them.
*  There's a famous example of a player from high school committed to the University of
*  Florida after its collective promised to pay him more than $10 million.
*  Then the collective didn't have the money shut down and he didn't get paid at all.
*  He transferred to another school.
*  So there's no recourse to rely on if these collectives leave you high and dry.
*  So players are really exposed in that way.
*  The second way is that there's just no transparency here.
*  There's no way for players to gather the information they need to know how much they should expect
*  to be paid and how much they're worth.
*  Think about professional leagues, right?
*  We know how much a good second baseman in Major League Baseball ought to get.
*  We know how much a good quarterback in the National Football League ought to get because
*  there are unions, there's a minimum contract, but there's also a lot of transparency about
*  what other players at those skill levels and those positions are paid.
*  There's none of that here.
*  It's all sort of rumors and misinformation.
*  So if you're a player or player in his family trying to navigate this market and find out
*  really what you're worth, it's almost impossible.
*  And the secrecy goes so far that even within teams, we talked to a collective at SMU, Southern
*  Methodist, who said, we tell our players, don't ask each other what we're paying you because
*  we don't want you to find out that the guy next to you is getting paid more.
*  When I say there's no transparency, I've tried that.
*  I sent public records requests to more than 40 public universities about what their NIO
*  collectives are paying their students.
*  And almost all of them said either that they didn't know or they wouldn't tell us.
*  In some cases, they wouldn't tell us because basically the logic was we want our football
*  team to win.
*  And if we tell you what our players get paid, that might result in a collective disadvantage
*  for us.
*  And so we're just not going to tell you.
*  That's how hard it is to figure out what the rules are and the standards are in this
*  market.
*  Imagine trying to navigate that as an 18 or 19 year old.
*  I mean, that is a truly extreme level of secrecy that these collectives are treating what are
*  ostensibly charity payments in some cases as a trade secret.
*  Right.
*  And if you pull back, there's a really big equity problem.
*  Now college sports are subject to something called Title IX, which is federal legislation
*  that mandates equal opportunity for female athletes and male athletes.
*  Obviously, the decades that Title IX has been in place, it has caused a revolution in women's
*  sports, not just in the college level, but the professional level.
*  Collectives are because they're third parties, they're not part of the university, they are
*  not subject to Title IX and they do not follow it.
*  Definitely.
*  So I think the average salary for men's basketball players from collectives is like 30,000 something.
*  The average salary for women's basketball players is like 9000.
*  So there's a huge imbalance toward male athletes and the collectives say, you know, that's
*  what our donors want.
*  Our donors are people who like to watch football.
*  So there's no requirement that they share the wealth with the rest of the sports teams
*  at the school the way there is for money that comes through the university.
*  The other big downside is that a lot of what these groups are doing may be illegal.
*  And that goes back to the fact that a lot of them, like the one at University of Texas,
*  are operating as tax-exempt charities.
*  Explain that.
*  I talked before about sort of the rules that tax-exempt charities have to follow.
*  Money in a tax-exempt charity is supposed to be used for the public good and it can't
*  be used to benefit the private interests of a few people.
*  Now the IRS is effectively the regulator of nonprofits in the U.S. and it allowed a lot
*  of these nonprofits in, it gave them tax-exempt status, these collectives, and then in May
*  of this year it seemed to reverse itself.
*  But the IRS did put out a memo saying the way that a lot of these collectives operate
*  shows that what they really care about is helping the athletes and helping the team
*  win, not helping the public good.
*  And if that's the case, you can't really be a charity.
*  You're not really tax-exempt if that's the case.
*  So it was a warning to all the collectives out there, look, you've got to change in the
*  future.
*  You have to reorganize your operations so that you really are helping the public good
*  first and paying the athletes second.
*  So a lot of the collectives are sort of grappling with that.
*  Do we just keep doing what we're doing until the IRS comes to us specifically and makes
*  a stop?
*  Or is that too much of a risk?
*  Are we taking the risk that we're going to lose our tax exemption, have to pay penalty
*  taxes?
*  Should we make some change in the meantime?
*  Are they making change in the meantime?
*  As somebody who's talked to many, many of these groups, I will say no.
*  Some of them have talked about making changes.
*  The only groups we've found making a change are the ones that had not actually gotten
*  approval before the IRS changed its mind.
*  So there's one in the University of Michigan that was still in the queue for approval when
*  the IRS changed its mind, and they had to massively overhaul their operations to get
*  approval.
*  So where a lot of collectives pay 100% of their money to athletes, they had to change
*  so they paid 70% of their money to other charities and only 30% of their money to athletes.
*  So imagine if you have to convert your collective to run on that model, 70% of your money doesn't
*  go to the athletes.
*  So try telling that to your donors.
*  And how much more money would you have to raise to have the same impact on your school?
*  It certainly seems as though this system is flawed and it's drawing increasing criticism.
*  There are questions about the legality of it.
*  So how is the body that sets the rules for college sports, the NCAA, responding?
*  So far, they've responded really weakly.
*  In fact, the only case we know of where anyone's been punished for NIL being used in recruiting,
*  which again is against the rules, is a case where at the University of Miami, a booster
*  who was paying a lot of NIL money to players sort of took pictures of himself, live tweeted
*  himself recruiting two players from another school to Miami.
*  Wow.
*  In that case, where the proof was on the internet, the NCAA punished the Miami basketball team
*  lightly.
*  Nobody else that we know of has been punished in that way.
*  The NCAA sees what's happening and I think realizes two things.
*  One, that it's encouraged huge, wide scale disobedience of its rules.
*  And also that it's allowed a shift of power from the schools themselves to these donor
*  run collectives that the conferences, the schools and the NCAA are alarmed by.
*  So what they've done is propose a pretty significant overhaul of the way these rules work.
*  Okay, what is it?
*  At the core of it, the idea is that schools would now be able to pay their own players
*  directly.
*  So the thing that collectives do now, paying the players through this NIL system, nominally
*  paying them for their name, image and likeness, but really just paying them to play, that
*  function would now be shifted to the schools themselves.
*  So the school athletic department could pay one of its offensive linemen for his quote
*  unquote name, image and likeness rights and the collective wouldn't be necessary anymore.
*  I think the floor would be $30,000 per player and it could go up from there.
*  How would that actually work in practice?
*  Because I have to imagine that not every school can afford to pay all of their athletes at
*  least $30,000.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  Now obviously this is just a proposal.
*  It's a long way from becoming a reality, but it's interesting to see how the NCAA imagines
*  that if it did become reality, the world would change.
*  And what it imagines is basically a league of super teams.
*  You're going to take the top 30 teams in college football, which are the ones that
*  can afford to pay their players and be in this game, and you're going to cleave them
*  off and make them into sort of like a miniature NFL.
*  So that's bad for the people who are on the outside of that system looking in.
*  You know, if you root for Washington State or Minnesota or Rice or Vanderbilt, one of
*  these schools that probably isn't going to have the money to compete or want to compete,
*  at least now you have the sense that like maybe if everything goes right, you could
*  be a Cinderella team.
*  You know, there's still theoretically a chance for you to be in the national championship.
*  Now Cinderella's at home with the mice.
*  There's no chance.
*  You're like legally never going to compete for that championship and you're playing for
*  a second class crown.
*  Maybe people are okay with that, but it changes what it means to be a fan of those schools.
*  And under this proposal in this theoretical super league, are the universities treating
*  their players, the students, like employees?
*  No.
*  So the schools would take the function of paying the players from the collectives and
*  take it for themselves, but they would still want to pursue this kind of like quirky logic
*  to make sure that the students are not employees because the NCAA still doesn't want to take
*  on the employer-employee relationship with students and all the other rights to collective
*  bargaining, you know, employment law protections, workers comp, all the things that would come
*  with that relationship.
*  This is an effort to keep that out whilst taking the function of paying the players
*  in.
*  Hearing this proposal, it seems like the NCAA is really walking this tightrope where it
*  is proposing a change, but not fully embracing the idea that college athletes should be treated
*  like professionals.
*  There's financial reasons for that.
*  You know, the schools want to keep as much of this huge amount of money for themselves
*  and not share it with players.
*  But there's also something that's really fundamental about college sports that I think they worry
*  about being lost, and that is the magic of college sports is that it's not professional
*  sports.
*  You know, there's this idea that the players play for the fight song and the school spirit
*  and the meaning of what it means to be a Texas Longhorn or, you know, A&M Aggie or whoever
*  else.
*  So when you cheer in the stands and they play in the field, you're all part of something
*  that's bigger than just money.
*  And if you make it money, if college sports becomes mercenaries going from place to place,
*  you know, for salaries, I think they're worried that they'll lose the thing that has made
*  college sports such a zillion dollar industry, that it'll just become basically a minor
*  league.
*  And who cares about minor league sports?
*  I have to ask, honestly, as a viewer of college sports, was there any of that amateurism really
*  left in football, for example?
*  I mean, so much of it already feels like a professional sport.
*  The money that comes in, not to the players, but to the schools, the number of viewers,
*  the stakes.
*  And I'd imagine college football already has more viewers than the NHL, for example.
*  Yes.
*  I mean, in so many ways, this was already professionalized.
*  The only thing that seemed different before was that the labor was free.
*  I think of this as sort of like a Santa Claus problem, right?
*  If you want to believe in Santa Claus, you go looking for reasons to believe that.
*  And until you see the guy at the mall take off his beard and see that it's not Santa
*  Claus, until you're forced to sort of see that the illusion is an illusion, you're looking
*  for reasons to believe.
*  And that's the case with football fans like me.
*  The illusion that's being perpetrated here that we want to believe in is that those guys
*  in the field are doing it for me.
*  They're doing it because they love the school that I love.
*  They're doing it because they believe in the fight song and the ethos and the lore of the
*  school.
*  They're out there playing hard because me in the stands and them on the field, we're
*  all supporting the same institution.
*  So what these collectives have done, it's sort of ironic that they are such shadowy
*  secretive organizations, their existence and the way that they have sort of brought the
*  payment of players, normalized it, brought it into the light, has sort of changed the
*  illusions, made it impossible to see that that's to believe that's Santa Claus, right?
*  And I think that's going to change the way that the college sports goes on in the future.
*  It's certainly a benefit for players.
*  The question is, what does it mean for fans?
*  And you know, if our illusion goes away, does that change the popularity of the sport?
*  Does it change what draws people in?
*  It's certainly going to be a big change that both players and fans have to reckon with.
*  David, thank you so much.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  The Federal Aviation Administration ordered U.S. airlines to temporarily stop flying Boeing
*  737 MAX 9 planes after a harrowing episode on Friday in which an Alaska Airlines jet
*  was forced to make an emergency landing.
*  After taking off from Portland, Oregon, part of the body of the plane blew out midair,
*  terrifying passengers and exposing them to howling winds 16,000 feet above ground.
*  The plane landed safely and no one was seriously injured, but the incident prompted U.S. regulators
*  to require immediate safety inspections of all similar planes, forcing Boeing to again
*  confront concerns over the MAX, its best-selling and most scrutinized plane in history.
*  And on Sunday, Senate and House leaders announced they had struck a bipartisan agreement on
*  2024 government funding in hopes of averting a looming government shutdown.
*  The deal, which sets total spending at around $1.6 trillion, keeps in place a compromise
*  measure struck last year by President Biden and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, but
*  it stops short of steeper budget cuts proposed by far-right House Republicans.
*  While calling it the best spending deal Republicans had secured in years, Speaker Mike Johnson
*  acknowledged the difficulty ahead in passing the deal through the House.
*  Ultra conservatives in the House have steadfastly refused to support any spending deal that
*  does not also include new immigration restrictions to stem the flow of migrants to the United States.
*  Lawmakers have less than two weeks to pass the measure and get it to President Biden's desk.
*  Without a deal, funding for parts of the government will start to expire, setting off a partial
*  government shutdown on January 19th.
*  Today's episode was produced by Astha Chattervedi and Will Reed, with help from Carlos Prieto,
