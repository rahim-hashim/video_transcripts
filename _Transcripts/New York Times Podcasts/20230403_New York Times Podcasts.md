*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro.
*  This is a Daily.
*  Today, what the indictment and impending arrest of Donald Trump means for both him and
*  his party.
*  My colleague Maggie Haberman has the inside story of how it's been playing out.
*  It's Monday, April 3rd.
*  Maggie.
*  Michael.
*  I was thinking in preparation for this interview how much the history of the Daily has been defined
*  by you coming on to talk about Donald Trump.
*  There's the kind of presidential phase, then there's the post-presential phase, now there's
*  the indictment phase of Maggie explaining and translating the world of Donald Trump.
*  It is always a privilege to be here with you on what I think is now our seventh year.
*  Yes.
*  Maybe our seventh lifetime.
*  Now that Trump has been indicted over these hush 20 payments made during his first presidential
*  campaign, we want to understand how he and those around him and really the entire
*  Republican party have been processing this really extraordinary moment.
*  If we can, I want to start the clock back just a little bit to the days before the indictment,
*  and the possibility of it based on your reporting seemed to be very much on Trump's mind.
*  Sure.
*  So, you have to remember, Michael, that for Trump being under investigation is not a new phenomenon.
*  He's been the subject of criminal investigations on and off for the past nearly 45 years from
*  when he was a young developer working with his father, Fred in New York real estate, and
*  he developed a playbook for dealing with investigations, throwing all kinds of wrenches
*  into cases to delay them, trying to run down the clock, and in some cases trying to
*  schmooze prosecutors.
*  But he's never, not once before, been charged with a crime.
*  And so, the possibility that what is essentially a winning streak might end has been simply put,
*  terrifying for him.
*  The thought of being indicted was terrifying for him.
*  And you saw that when you could see he was aware it was likely coming, and he began trying
*  to focus his supporters' energy.
*  In a post on his Truth Social account this morning, former president Trump announced that
*  he expects to be indicted by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg in the investigation.
*  So, on March 18th, he posted an untruth social, the social media website.
*  He wrote, in all caps, the far and away leading Republican candidate and former president
*  of the United States of America will be arrested on Tuesday of next week.
*  And he said that he would be arrested three days later on Tuesday, March 21st.
*  Trump, whose supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, 2021, wrote, quote,
*  protest, take our nation back.
*  And look, it's not the normal behavior of a target of an investigation.
*  Right to announce these about to be arrested.
*  Right, and more importantly, it wasn't true.
*  You know, he had put out this day that was as best as anyone can tell a guess that his
*  lawyers were making, but it hadn't been reported.
*  But why?
*  And why would you tell the world you're about to be arrested when you have no knowledge
*  or about to be arrested?
*  And you're basically just guessing at it.
*  So it's a great question.
*  And I think to a large degree, it was a projection of his anxiety.
*  And at the same time, it was a way to try to control the narrative and media attention
*  and to project his power.
*  And how in that strategy is he actually projecting his power?
*  So remember, there are a huge group of Republicans who after 2020 and the January 6th, 2021 attack
*  on the Capitol have concluded that Trump is bad for the party.
*  They feel he hurt the party in the midterm elections when the party did nowhere near as
*  well as it could have or seemed like it was on track to do.
*  But after Trump's post about an arrest, you already see the party starting to have to
*  contend with the reality of this enormous place and poll he still has over the party.
*  Explain that.
*  How does that start to reveal itself?
*  Well, within hours of Trump saying this on truth social, one of the most powerful figures
*  in government, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy announced that he would have committees investigate
*  the Manhattan district attorney who's leading this case against Trump, Alvin Bragg.
*  Right.
*  In other words, he would use the Republican controlled house as a kind of weapon against the people
*  who would soon in theory be charging Trump.
*  Yes, that was not actually what he said, but that is the actual practical effect.
*  An allies of Trump then used this unverified claim of an impending arrest to try to pressure
*  and almost beat down his biggest rival in the 2024 presidential race, Florida governor
*  Ron DeSantis to say something supportive of Trump.
*  Until Trump posted on truth social, the Sanchez had really been avoiding, waiting into this
*  case.
*  He was staying silent, but Trump's advisors and his campaign saw an opening.
*  This campaign war room issued a statement saying it has been over 24 hours and some people
*  are still silent.
*  History will judge their silence.
*  So some people here everyone understood to mean Ron DeSantis.
*  He was one of the thumbs.
*  He was one of the thumbs.
*  He was a big sum.
*  So what does DeSantis do in response to this pressure campaign?
*  So for two days, DeSantis didn't say anything.
*  And then at an event in Panama City, Florida, DeSantis was asked by reporters about what
*  Trump had said.
*  And he attacked Bragg in sort of standard terms at this point, denounced him as a district
*  attorney, but then twice made a point of saying that he doesn't know anything about hush
*  money payments to porn stars.
*  Now Trump, we should note, has denied either having an affair with the porn star in question,
*  or the millennials, or paying her off, but DeSantis knew what he was doing.
*  And it was a tweak at Trump.
*  It was a dig at the personal conduct.
*  Got it.
*  Okay.
*  So what happens next at this point in the chronology, Trump has claimed without any verification that
*  he's about to get arrested, thereby forcing people like Ron DeSantis to have to react
*  and kind of genuinely reflect but not quite.
*  So what happens next?
*  So Tuesday March 21st comes and goes and Trump is of course not arrested because they're
*  never once they plan to arrest him that day because he had not been indicted.
*  But then something interesting happens.
*  Trump and those around him immediately start developing a new message.
*  They start insisting that the case against him is falling apart.
*  Interesting.
*  That is a big change of what is behind that.
*  So this was fueled primarily by a lawyer named Bob Costello.
*  We are hearing from somebody who used to represent somebody else who used to represent
*  Donald Trump.
*  How's that?
*  A guy named Robert Costello who testified to a grand jury Manhattan.
*  And if you're looking at it.
*  Costello testified before the grand jury is a witness for Trump.
*  Listen, if they want to go after Donald Trump and they have solid evidence, so be it.
*  But Michael Cohn is far from solid evidence.
*  Costello had had interactions with Michael Cohn, the key witness in this case, who is the
*  one who made the hush money payments.
*  This guy, by any prosecutor's standard, and I used to be deputy chief of the criminal
*  vision in the Southern District of New York, I wouldn't have touched a guy like Michael
*  Cohn, especially if he's a convicted perjurer.
*  And so Costello goes on this media tour and he is telling one reporter after another that
*  in his testimony he had completely attacked and crushed the credibility of Michael Cohn.
*  The only thing I'm doing is trying to tell the truth to the grand jurors because I read
*  all these lies in the media that are being promoted by one side.
*  And then from there, the Trump folks appear to start believing their own hype, claiming
*  that the case is falling apart.
*  And you know that nobody would rely on the word of Michael Cohn as a witness because Costello
*  was so strong and that brag, according to them, was now having concerns about bringing
*  this case.
*  They never provided any evidence of what they were saying.
*  And so by the time we got to mid last week, Michael, around Wednesday, Trump's team was
*  so convinced that nothing was happening.
*  There were reports that the grand jury was adjourning for a month, one of Trump's own
*  top advisors was assuring colleagues that things were on ice, possibly forever, that Trump
*  AIDS started leaving Palm Beach and going to other places, in some cases, flying out
*  of the state entirely because they believed they were just fine.
*  I mean, it's kind of remarkable because Trump goes in, I think the span of just a few days
*  from being so freaked out that he tells the world he's about to be arrested to suddenly
*  it seems deciding nothing to see here, folks.
*  Everybody can just leave Mar-a-Lago.
*  I'm fine.
*  To the point that he posts on truth social, that he has, you know, strange new respect
*  for the grand jury system and the grand jurors because according to him, this is all going
*  so well for him.
*  And it's a real window, Michael, into the way Trump world operates.
*  You know, there's one advisor in particular who other AIDS referred to as the good news
*  guy, somebody who just feeds Trump, you know, what he wants to hear and positive information
*  regardless of whether it's true or not.
*  And Trump, you know, has this whole reliance on, you know, the so-called power of positive
*  thinking and he believes that it really does impact events or at least claims that he
*  believes that and he has for decades.
*  And then you have all these people around him who both fear him and want to please him.
*  And so they end up feeding this back to him and it becomes this kind of self-fueling
*  ecosystem where facts are what you make them.
*  And where reality can be distorted very powerfully.
*  And where legal problems can be conflated with public relations problems and media strategy
*  problems and it all becomes part of one big feed.
*  Fascinating.
*  And then of course, it turns out all of that is entirely misplaced.
*  Yes, none of what they were saying was going to happen happen.
*  In fact, it was quite the opposite.
*  And so when the indictment finally comes last Thursday, late in the afternoon, it really
*  catches Trump and his advisors off guard because of what they had been telling themselves
*  and in some cases telling each other.
*  And so what is as best you can tell, Trump's reaction when this indictment that he was
*  so scared of and then suddenly not worried about it all becomes real.
*  He was furious.
*  He was very, very angry.
*  Well, he released a statement through his spokesperson calling the indictment election
*  interference at the highest level in history.
*  And he delivered a statement with AIDS.
*  He accused, quote, radical left Democrats of engaging in a witch hunt.
*  And saying, quote, the Democrats have lied, cheated and stolen in their obsession with
*  trying to get Trump.
*  In which he calls it political persecution, a witch hunt and says the justice system is
*  being weaponized against him.
*  All of which feels like standard Donald Trump language in a situation like this.
*  But as you hinted at earlier, no situation like this has ever exist for him.
*  No, that's right.
*  And in fact, so many predictions of his demise didn't come true.
*  So this indictment actually happened.
*  And this is then the moment when the entire Republican party has to figure out how it is
*  going to react to this historic development.
*  You know, the former president has just been indicted.
*  Is the leading Republican candidate for president in 2024?
*  And they have to figure out what to do.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Maggie, what kind of response do we see from Republicans once this thing that had
*  seemed so theoretical becomes real?
*  So I think it's fair to say that their reactions break down into two categories.
*  The first are those who come out and defend him because they genuinely are behind Trump
*  and believe that this indictment, which they don't know the details of yet to be clear,
*  is wrong and unjust.
*  Can you believe the mockery they are making of America?
*  So there was Marjorie Taylor Greene who has said she's going to New York to support
*  Trump in person, although it remains to be seen if that will happen.
*  They just want a mug shot.
*  And I hope to God that President Donald J. Trump smiles as pretty for that picture because
*  they're going to use it in all their campaign.
*  So I want my president to look good.
*  Don't you?
*  There's Congressman Jim Jordan.
*  And so it is ridiculous.
*  I think the American people see it for what it is.
*  I mean, think about it.
*  Who's now using his position in the House to subpoena district attorney, Alvin Bragg?
*  Everything is on the table because the American people deserve answers to why a district attorney
*  is doing something that has never happened in the history of our great country.
*  And these are Maga Republicans who are fiercely loyal to Trump.
*  But then on the other side, you have Republicans who aren't actually loyal to Trump at all,
*  who feel the need to defend him and to attack this indictment because they fear crossing
*  him.
*  So Governor Ron DeSantis calls the indictment on Twitter, the weaponization of the legal
*  system to advance a political agenda refers to it as un-American.
*  And also vows not to extradite Trump from Florida to New York.
*  Well, I think the unprecedented indictment of a former president of the United States on
*  a campaign finance issue is an outrage.
*  And you know, we also saw Mike Pence, the former vice president under Trump, who has been
*  trying to establish some distance from Trump in various ways, compelled to denounce the
*  indictment.
*  And it appears to have millions of Americans to be nothing more than a political prosecution
*  that's driven by.
*  So what starts happening after the indictment is real, is they're starting to offer much
*  more full-throated and explicit defenses of Trump.
*  It feels worse talking about the strength of this reaction that comes after this indictment,
*  this instinct to defend Trump from people who, in the case of DeSantis and Pence, are very
*  likely to run against him for the Republican nomination in 2024.
*  That's just not normal behavior from people in politics who are trying to beat you.
*  That's weird.
*  Viewing Trump's antagonists as part of a liberal overreach has become a bar for entry in Republican
*  politics for Republican candidates in primaries.
*  And the fear for candidates, not just for president, but up and down ballots, is that they
*  will be punished by the voters in those primaries if they don't do just that.
*  Right.
*  And that's because Trump created that universe.
*  And when we talked to you about this so many times throughout his presidency, he created
*  a world in which any effort to hold him accountable is the, quote unquote, weaponization of the
*  justice system.
*  Correct.
*  And furthermore, he tells those voters, I'm for you, so they're coming after me.
*  And so in our reporting, we talked to a lot of Republican leaders who said, this indictment
*  is making it harder to push Trump aside.
*  For example, David McIntosh, the president of the club for growth, who has no love lost
*  for Donald Trump.
*  He leads a conservative anti-tax group seeking a replacement for Trump as the face of the
*  Republican party.
*  He said the indictment had already generated sympathy for the former president.
*  So the argument for someone like McIntosh is basically that given the dynamic you just
*  described, an indictment of Trump makes Trump a stronger Republican candidate for the
*  nomination.
*  It bonds a group of Republican voters more tightly to Trump.
*  And that therefore makes it harder for any other candidate to build them away.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  I mean, that's really interesting because in that sense, if you're an anti-Trump Republican
*  and there are a lot of them at this point, you may be wishing that this indictment had
*  never happened.
*  There are a lot of Republicans who have said privately, Michael, that they wish this indictment
*  had not happened, even if they dislike Donald Trump intensely.
*  And as you say, many do.
*  But they recognize that this one in particular, because it involves personal conduct, because
*  of the dynamics of it, the timing of it, the fact that it happened before he was president,
*  may feel this one is not the test case that should have happened.
*  Right, because that's kind of the ultimate capstone version of the story Trump has been
*  telling Republican voters about how they're out to get me.
*  Or at least it makes it easier to sell it that way, yes.
*  Right.
*  And I think that brings us to how Trump will now use this indictment in his campaign for
*  press.
*  And what do we know about that?
*  Well, it's interesting.
*  It's an honor to be here.
*  I say hello, Texas.
*  We really got a taste of that when he held a campaign rally just over a week ago in
*  Waco, Texas, right after he had claimed falsely that he was about to be arrested.
*  Right.
*  From the beginning, it's been one which hunt and fauna investigation after another.
*  And the indictment was a huge focus of that rally.
*  The new weapon being used by out of control, unhinged Democrats to cheat on election, is
*  criminally investigating a candidate.
*  And already he was claiming during the rally, the craziest thing.
*  I got bad publicity in my poll numbers have gone through the roof.
*  Would you explain this?
*  But even the potential of an indictment was helping him do better than ever before in
*  the polls.
*  And is that true?
*  I mean, he said it before he was indicted.
*  Now he hasn't been indicted.
*  Like, is there any evidence that this is going to help him with Republican voters?
*  In some polls, for instance, there was a Yahoo poll right after the indictment that
*  show Trump with his biggest lead yet over to Santa.
*  It went from an eight point lead before the indictment to a 26 point lead after.
*  And so at least for now, Trump is showing real signs of strength after this indictment
*  among Republicans.
*  So given that, is it safe to assume that Trump will be openly embracing the indictment
*  as a kind of political asset?
*  I think at least for now, it's safe to say that the indictment is basically going to
*  be Trump's running mate as he's a candidate for president.
*  You know, the Trump campaign says that it raised more than $4 million within 24 hours
*  after the indictment happened.
*  Which is an extraordinary amount of money.
*  It's a lot of money.
*  But none of that changes the reality that this entire legal saga could end with him being
*  convicted and possibly going to jail, which would negate whatever strength this brings
*  him in a Republican primary because it would fundamentally change the course of his entire
*  life.
*  And I wonder how Trump and those around him think about that prospect?
*  It is really uncharted territory for them.
*  You know, Trump advisors encanded moments privately acknowledged that one reason that he ran
*  for president in 2024 was to use his candidacy as a shield against such a thing happening.
*  I mean, can you explain that?
*  Is there any kind of legal logic to that running again after losing in 2020 as a kind of legal
*  protection?
*  Several people have told me that he believes it is going to be harder for prosecutors to
*  wage a prosecution against him if he is a candidate.
*  Now his lawyer has warned him that a candidacy wouldn't actually be a shield against prosecution.
*  And the fact that there's now an indictment proves that point.
*  Right.
*  And that point is going to become very, very tangible to Trump in the next 48 hours or so.
*  We're talking on Sunday afternoon, on Tuesday.
*  Trump is going to have to show up in Manhattan and face these charges in person.
*  And that is going to be, I imagine, very humbling.
*  Yes.
*  On Monday afternoon, he will travel from Florida to New York City.
*  He will stay at Trump Tower for the night.
*  And then on Tuesday, he will have to surrender to authorities in a New York City courthouse.
*  He will be fingerprinted.
*  We don't think he's likely to be handcuffed.
*  And then he will be arraigned, which is a court hearing in which all of the charges from
*  this indictment are finally aired and unsealed.
*  We think there will be about two dozen of those charges at least.
*  Right.
*  And then in all of those moments, this is all going to become very real for Trump.
*  Now he has talked to advisors a lot about his so-called perp-walk, where he has led down
*  a hall into a courtroom.
*  Should he smile or not?
*  How should he handle it?
*  And has he concluded one way or another?
*  I think that we're not going to know until game time, Michael.
*  But that does suggest that he's incredibly sensitive to every single dimension of this.
*  I mean, right down to Am I Marous or Am I Smiling?
*  Am I Defiant or Am I Sad?
*  I mean, that's really fascinating.
*  Yes.
*  And I think two things can be true at once.
*  He can lean into the spectacle of what that day is going to be.
*  And he can also be deeply anxious about what is about to happen to him in this moment
*  that he has been trying to avoid for decades.
*  Right.
*  The reality is, Michael, I think this is going to be the lowest point in his career.
*  This is a man for whom the fear of public humiliation has been an animating force for
*  decades.
*  This really is one of his deepest insecurities and anxieties that he could be just another
*  person thrown in jail.
*  And we know how much he fears that because in 2021, the former chief financial officer of
*  the Trump organization, Alan Weiselberg, who's around Trump's age, was indicted and arrested.
*  And Trump was horrified watching the footage of him on television, being hauled into court.
*  He would tell people, could you believe what they're doing to that old man?
*  Right.
*  And now he will be that man.
*  He will be that man.
*  That is correct.
*  But there's also the possibility, basically, that there is.
*  That's a very real possibility in any case.
*  And if that happens, it would be its own earthquake, because it would be the ultimate vindication
*  for him.
*  It would happen most likely in the middle of a presidential campaign.
*  And it could just have huge consequences and reverberations in that race, in his ability
*  to tell people that he's a victim, in his ability to get people to feel sympathy for
*  him, and perhaps to vote for him.
*  And even to vote for him.
*  Oh, Maggie, thank you very much.
*  Michael, thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  To the weekend, a series of severe storms tore to the American South and Midwest, leaving
*  at least 32 people dead and injuring dozens more.
*  Tennessee was the hardest hit, with at least 15 people killed, including three in Memphis.
*  In Illinois, the roof of a concert hall collapsed during the middle of a show, leaving one person
*  dead and 48 hurt.
*  The storms are expected to continue into the week.
*  Anne, an influential Russian military blogger who had called for an escalation of the war
*  in Ukraine, was killed on Sunday when a bomb exploded in a cafe in St. Petersburg, where
*  he was delivering a talk.
*  It was the most high-profile attack on a prominent supporter of the war since August, when
*  a car bomb killed Darya Dugina, the daughter of a prominent ally of Russian President Vladimir
*  Putin.
*  The United States later linked that attack to the Ukrainian government.
*  But so far, it's unclear who was behind Sunday's attack.
*  Today's episode was produced by Rachel Cuesta and Ricky Novetsky.
*  It was edited by Anita Botticeau and Rachel Cuesta, with help from Devon Taylor, contains
*  original music from Mary and Luzano and Dan Powell, and was engineered by Chris Wood.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Lansford of Wonderly.
*  That's it for the daily.

*  See you tomorrow.
