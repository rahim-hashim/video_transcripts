*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Borrow. This is A Daily.
*  On the day that taxes are due in the U.S., we look at how a plan to give the internal
*  revenue service billions of dollars in new money could result in the agency repeating
*  a set of old mistakes that hurt everyday Americans.
*  Today, my colleague, Alan Rappaporn, explains.
*  It's Tuesday, April 18th.
*  Alan, happy tax day. The last possible day to file your taxes without incurring some
*  sort of late fee. It used to always be the 15th. For some reason it's the 18th. I filed
*  mine a week ago. I want to know if you have filed.
*  Minor in as well. Happy tax day to you, Michael. It's a big day for the country and for the
*  IRS, especially. This is really important. Why isn't it the 15th anymore? It's a calendar
*  quirk. It depends how holiday is lined up. Sometimes it has been delayed over the years
*  as well when there have been technical issues with the IRS and other things going on. Usually
*  it's around the 15th, but this year people get an extra weekend to cram.
*  Right. We are not here to talk about who filed one, but instead to talk about why the
*  Biden administration has decided that the IRS, this agency that literally makes our
*  government work by collecting our taxes, why it needs changing? President Biden, along
*  with Democrats, passed a major piece of legislation just a couple of months ago to make some
*  pretty meaningful changes to the IRS. It's only now that we're starting to understand
*  what those changes are going to look like and what kind of battle they may instigate.
*  So talk to us about these changes and what has motivated them.
*  Well, the biggest change is that the IRS is getting an infusion of $80 billion, which
*  is the largest sum of money that it's gotten, basically in its entire history. For years,
*  the IRS in most New York time stories actually has usually been associated with the adjective
*  as beleaguered. And for years and years and years, it's been underfunded. It's barely
*  been able to do its job, which is to, as you said, collect taxes and revenue for the
*  US government to make the whole country run. And it's really kind of one of the most
*  important cogs in the whole economy. And for so long, those gears were not working properly.
*  Well, let's talk about that. I mean, how badly have these gears been working? How underfunded
*  exactly has the IRS been? In the last decade, the IRS is funding has dropped by about 20%,
*  it's staffing has dropped by about 20%. Wow. So this has led to all kinds of problems
*  for the agency from a shortage of staplers to piles and piles of millions of backlog
*  tax returns that agents and staffers have been trying to sift through is led to long
*  delays for people getting their refunds. And people just can't even get through to the
*  agency when they call and try and ask for help. I have to pause, however, on a stapler
*  shortage. The IRS doesn't have enough staplers. That's right. It's kind of amazing to think
*  about that the tax collection agency for the most powerful and richest country in the world
*  is lacking in office supplies. But this is true. But as you said, the IRS is about to get
*  this huge amount of money, $80 billion. In fact, so what exactly will that money go towards
*  besides those long needed staplers? It's going to go to a lot of things. And the Biden administration
*  has been focusing primarily on how it's going to improve customer service for taxpayers
*  so that they are going to be able to get through to people on the phones to get their
*  questions answered. And it's going to be a lot more customer service friendly as they
*  like to say. But in reality, more than half of the money is actually going to go towards
*  enforcing the tax code, which is sort of the part that the White House doesn't like to
*  talk about as much. They're going to be hiring thousands of new revenue agents who are
*  going to be focused on cracking down on rich taxpayers and big companies to make sure
*  they're paying what they owe. And the administration estimates that over the next decade under
*  the current system, $7 trillion of tax money that it's owed to the government is actually
*  not going to go collected because of tax evasion schemes and just the fact that the agency can't
*  really conduct the kinds of audits that it needs to conduct. So this is a big opportunity
*  and strategy for them to change that and start tripping away at this so-called tax gap.
*  Right. And my recollection from previous episodes of the Daily is that for Biden, this isn't
*  just a lot of trillions of dollars he'd like to have. He's banking on it. I mean, he
*  in various pieces of legislation said, I'm going to pay for this by making the IRS better at
*  collecting taxes, right? Exactly. This has been a huge part of the Biden administration's agenda
*  because Democrats, as much as they talk about wanting to raise taxes on the rich and others,
*  they didn't have the votes to do that. And when they wanted to raise tax revenue to pay for
*  some of the things that they wanted to accomplish, like climate change legislation, you know, changes
*  to reduce drug costs for senior citizens, all these progressive priorities, they weren't going
*  to be able to pay for them by raising taxes on the rich directly, but they were able to convince
*  enough Democrats to go along with increasing funding for the IRS so they could collect tax money
*  that the government's already owed and by enforcing the tax code that already exists.
*  Right. And very importantly, you said that this is the part of this reform, the enforcement part,
*  the new agent part, that the Biden administration doesn't want to talk about. And my sense is that
*  that's because of what Republicans will say about hiring that many new agents. Yes, and Democrats
*  are right to be worried about that. Hiring 87,000 new agents, doubling the size of the IRS. I don't
*  know who thinks that's a good idea. Does not improve the quality of information. Republicans have
*  already been seizing on the IRS money to attack Democrats. It will only increase the number of
*  audits most often on innocent small businesses and individuals. They're designed to come after
*  small businesses and working families across this country, saying that President Biden is trying to
*  install a shadow army that's going to be shaking down small businesses. They want to use that
*  money that they squeeze out of hard working taxpayers to pay for their big government socialist
*  agent. And they're going to go after everybody in America to suck you dry. And knocking on doors
*  with guns in the middle of the night to get taxpayers to pay more money. Are they going to have a
*  strike force that goes in with AK-15s already loaded, ready to shoot some small business person in Iowa?
*  Right. And this is a very long standing and familiar line of attack from Republicans.
*  Characterizing the IRS as like the ultimate embodiment of an overreaching, overzealous
*  government. You're saying that has reached a fever pitch since Biden proposed this money,
*  but it's been around for a while. That's right. And it's not entirely without justifications. There's
*  some real history of the IRS getting things wrong and doing things wrong and of people trying to
*  use the IRS to weaponize its resources against their opponents politically.
*  Okay, tell us that story because I'm not aware of it.
*  It really goes back all the way as far as the 1930s. FDR famously ordered his Treasury Secretary
*  Henry Morgantau to have the IRS initiate an investigation into Huey Long, who was a senator from
*  Louisiana. I myself would be indeed happy to see our child well program enacted in the loan.
*  Who had been critical of Roosevelt's new deal policies. We've had the promises from the president
*  many, many times. Now we're wanting a full film. And appeared to be contemplating a presidential
*  run in his own. Interesting. Yeah, exactly the IRS at Roosevelt's direction had probed to other
*  members of Mr. Long's political operation. We're taking kickbacks for state contracts in Louisiana.
*  And some of those people were actually indicted and prosecuted for tax evasion.
*  And that's because the IRS at the president's direction decided just to have a look around.
*  That's right. And Long wasn't the only one that FDR used the IRS to go after.
*  FDR was kind of smitten with the power of the IRS and he ended up trying to use it against other
*  political opponents and critics. He later went after William Randolph Hearst. Hi,
*  the publisher of the Hearst newspaper group. This whole system of income taxation.
*  He suddenly found his empire under investigation and scrutiny from the agency.
*  As degenerated into a racket. After its newspapers had been critical of FDR and its coverage.
*  Decades later it came up again with the Nixon administration in the 70s.
*  In my possession is a memorandum that was requested by me to prepare a means to attack the
*  enemies of the White House. We learned in the Watergate hearings that the Nixon White House had
*  transmitted a list of 600 enemies to the IRS. Basically to have them look at their financial
*  records and make their lives more difficult. The goal of the briefing paper was to make the
*  IRS politically responsive to the White House.
*  So these are cases where perhaps the IRS itself on its own wouldn't have done this and perhaps
*  didn't do anything wrong but it's clearly being abused or it's attempting to be abused by the
*  presidents above it who overseed it. Exactly. It raised a lot of concern that there was the
*  possibility that the IRS could be used against people for political reasons and it made people a
*  lot more scared that this agency which was supposed to be a tax collector could be something a lot
*  more and something a lot more scary. So what is the next big moment in this saga of the IRS?
*  The next big moment came in the 1990s when Republicans retook power in Congress and a lot of
*  the animosity was targeted at the IRS. In particular there was a lot of discussion about a provision
*  known as the earned income tax credit which actually allows lower income people to pay no taxes at
*  all or even get money back from the IRS. Republicans thought this provision was right for fraud and abuse
*  because people could potentially make up how little money they were making. So they wanted to
*  scale back this tax credit dramatically. That was going to be a big problem for President Clinton
*  politically. So President Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich struck a deal where the earned
*  income tax credit would be protected but in exchange for that the IRS would have more leeway
*  to audit low income people in exchange for protecting that tax credit. Got it. So Republicans attack
*  the earned income tax credit which in a sense is them attacking the IRS and Clinton comes in and the
*  deal that gets struck makes the IRS a bigger player in making sure the earned income tax credit
*  is not going to be abused. That all sounds pretty constructive actually.
*  In theory it sounded like a reasonable compromise but Republicans were far from done beating up
*  on the IRS. This morning we began the first of three days of oversight hearings and to the tactics
*  management and inner workings of the Internal Revenue Service. And there was a lot more criticism to
*  come. The awesome power of the IRS looms like the sword of Damakles over the heads of taxpayer.
*  And as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee I want to know why.
*  In 1997 and 1998 they launched a series of public hearings to try to discredit the agency.
*  This is a responsibility I take seriously. Some of the most memorable testimony from the time
*  came from regular Americans who were sharing horror stories. When the raid occurred at my home
*  the front door was torn from the hinges my dogs were impounded. About Gestapo like tactics that the
*  agency had used. If you had told me that 64 IRS agents would storm my office with side arms
*  holstered and boot heels trampling my civil rights and my business reputation I wouldn't have
*  believed you. For thousands of other taxpayers there is no help. The IRS is judge, jury and
*  executioner answerable to none. There was also really vivid testimony from IRS revenue agents.
*  The true number of incidents of taxpayer views were ever known. The public would be at all.
*  Sitting behind screens who were speaking with their voices altered so they could speak more freely.
*  Taxpayers deserve a consistent and fair policy. And they explained that they were directed
*  to audit poor taxpayers who were unable to really fight back against the IRS because they didn't
*  have the resources to do so. Senator they have less resources at their disposal as far as
*  attorneys or accountants and they're intimidated by the IRS. There was live television coverage of
*  this at the time. It was from page news, the cover of magazines and the IRS itself which is
*  governed by some privacy laws wasn't really able to properly defend itself. So the agency pretty
*  much was sitting there quietly while it was getting bashed all over the TV and across the country.
*  Right so if you're an American watching these hearings at home or waiting about them in the
*  newspaper and from you're saying it will be very hard to miss these hearings as a regular
*  news consumer. The message you're absorbing is that the country's tax authority is coming down
*  hardest on these regular people with the least resources to deal with these audits and it's scary.
*  Exactly and this just inflamed the fears that people already were feeling about the agency.
*  But Alan didn't that deal struck between President Clinton and House Speaker New Gingrich.
*  Didn't that deal encourage the IRS to do exactly what it's being accused of in that moment which is
*  to more rigorously audit lower income Americans. Well yeah but the program wasn't really in effect
*  just yet. It was just getting underway as these hearings were getting going. But at the same time
*  the IRS had already been going after lower income Americans. That's definitely true. They were
*  easy targets because they couldn't really fight back against these audits which were very time
*  consuming and expensive and the IRS basically saw them as the low hanging fruit in the economy that
*  they needed to go after this revenue that they desperately were trying to collect. And so after all
*  this there was pretty much bipartisan agreement that there needed to be big changes at the IRS.
*  In 1998 Congress passed a restructuring and reform act that was passed unanimously in the Senate
*  with the goal of making the IRS more user friendly. It wasn't going to come after people and
*  attack them anymore. It was going to be a friendlier or more warm and fuzzy IRS. There was even a new
*  mission statement that said that the IRS was now intended to help taxpayers understand and meet their
*  tax responsibilities as opposed to the old statement which said it was there to collect tax revenue.
*  Right we're here to help you not bust into your safe. So the meaning of all of this just to cut
*  through it is that there's now a bipartisan consensus that the IRS should be less powerful.
*  And this legislation is defanging it in a way. That's right. And there was a big investigation that
*  treasured's internal inspector general conducted after these hearings. In fact it found that some
*  of the claims that were made publicly were either exaggerated or unfounded. But the damage to the
*  IRS's reputation had pretty much been done anyway. So some of the most inflammatory elements of those
*  hearings turned out to be perhaps not quite true. That's right. One of the taxpayers who made the
*  allegations that the IRS agents had seized his safe and ransacked his house tried to file a lawsuit
*  against the IRS. But his case fell apart in court illustrating the fact that some of these claims
*  were wildly inflated. And yet the IRS has been totally overhauled because of the inflammatory claims
*  made in those hearings. So how does all of this end up impacting the IRS's ability to do its job?
*  It made the IRS's job a lot harder. The 1998 legislation made a lot of revenue agents feel hamstrung
*  because it allowed taxpayers to more easily file complaints against them. They were worried about
*  losing their jobs. And that was a good thing for rich taxpayers and small businesses because they
*  could afford to stand up to the IRS. But at the same time the agency was required under that Clinton
*  and Gingrich deal to more rigorously audit low-income taxpayers who got the earned income tax credit.
*  Right. So what it all resulted in was that by the year 2000 data showed that poor Americans
*  were disproportionately being audited compared to anyone else. Hmm. Fascinating. So by the time the IRS
*  is being publicly called out for auditing lots of non-rich Americans and especially poor Americans.
*  And you would think that the IRS would perhaps try to avoid doing that. It's hand is being forced
*  by that Clinton, Gingrich deal. And it kind of has to be auditing those people, those with the least
*  ability to handle an IRS audit or to fight back against them. That's right.
*  And yet the problems for the IRS are about to get even worse.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So on when and how do things get even worse for the already beleaguered IRS?
*  The IRS start coming under a lot of pressure again around 2013.
*  I bet most Americans don't know that almost all of the taxes that we give Republicans and their
*  crusades against taxes were on the rise. It takes the wealth away from the working people of the
*  America. You will be the Tea Party and you bring your family, you bring your grandma, you bring your
*  grandma. The Tea Party movement had been ascendant. You're protesting the good excess of spending
*  within the government. Rich Gun only knows where the money is going. So. And a lot of conservative
*  groups were starting to form. And while they were forming they were applying to the IRS for tax
*  exempt status as nonprofits so they wouldn't have to pay any tax. The IRS around that time,
*  which was struggling to keep up with all these applications started applying an extra layer of
*  scrutiny to these groups to make sure that they were actually eligible to be receiving the
*  special status. And they started including in their system search terms like Tea Party and Patriots
*  to search for applications that they thought might not actually be eligible.
*  Which I have to say makes a certain sense if you're the IRS and you're trying to figure out which
*  organizations might be abusing the tax code because after all Tea Party groups are very anti-tax.
*  And in fact their name comes from the most famous American tax avoidance which is the Boston Tea Party.
*  There's definitely a certain logic to that that makes sense but you know they raise complaints.
*  The Treasury Department's Inspector General launched an internal investigation and it found
*  that in fact some things were done wrong and that improper search criteria were being used
*  that was targeting these conservative groups. At that point the whole thing blew up.
*  This is the most corrupt and deceitful IRS in the history.
*  Republicans were up in arms and it was a huge political problem for the Obama administration.
*  And here's the other thing the President keeps saying it didn't happen but the lowest learner admitted
*  it happened. She said that they targeted based on names and policies. Which was being accused
*  of weaponizing the IRS against its political opponents. But it's his IRS that's done this and
*  they should be held accountable. Right and suddenly we're dealing with a situation that I remember
*  this well starts to feel like it's harkening back to the FDR and the Richard Nixon days of
*  a presidential administration using the IRS for political purposes to go after their enemies.
*  It was no secret in this moment that the Tea Party's biggest target was Barack Obama
*  and his Democratic Party. That's right it was history repeating itself in some ways. If in fact
*  IRS personnel engaged in the kind of practices that had been reported on.
*  It was a big political problem for President Obama. Then that's outrageous and there's no
*  place for it. There were public apologies from IRS officials and the IRS commissioner at the time
*  was fired for what happened. Wow. But in 2017 another report showed that the IRS had actually been
*  doing the same thing to Democrats using search terms that were focused on liberal groups.
*  But this was four years later and at that point the IRS's reputation had already been
*  tarnished some more and nobody really cared about that later report.
*  And once again the IRS found itself in a much weakened and depleted state. Budget after budget,
*  the agency saw its resources depleted mostly led by Republicans but Democrats who were not always
*  in power usually had to go along with it and that led to even fewer audits and less tax revenue
*  for the federal government. So at this point I much better understand the roots of this characterization.
*  However hyperbolic it is that the IRS is an overreaching agency prone to having its enormous power
*  abused. And I think that brings us to where we are right now which is Biden saying
*  we have to find a way to strengthen the IRS and make sure that it can do its actual job
*  especially when it comes to going after the rich. So his message is fund the IRS properly
*  and I promise you it will focus on the real abusers and those are people with money not the poor.
*  Yes the Biden administration is very aware and sensitive of all this history.
*  That's why President Biden has made this pledge that none of the money is going to be directed
*  at increasing audit rates for people who make under $400,000. That's going to be really challenging
*  for the IRS and a lot of ways to try to implement in practice but it's putting the message out there
*  that this money is directed at companies, large corporations and the wealthiest taxpayers.
*  And why is it going to be hard for Biden to keep that promise if you've got all these
*  billions of dollars and all these thousands of new agents? Why can't they successfully focus
*  on going after the rich and after businesses to make them pay what they actually owe?
*  Well one is that it's difficult for the IRS to figure out who's making less than $400,000 a year
*  if you're not auditing them. And then in terms of targeting all these additional resources at the
*  rich, well the issue is that it's really difficult to audit the rich sometimes and big companies.
*  They've got armies of accountants, lawyers, their tax situations can be really complicated
*  because the tax system has gotten so complicated. So it's going to be difficult for the IRS to
*  also hire people who are qualified to do this. The agency has been so beleaguered as we've said
*  over the years and badgered that it's not necessarily the most attractive place
*  where top tax talent wants to work. Right. If you are the smartest,
*  actuary in the country, you may not want to be working for the IRS but that's what the IRS
*  will need to penetrate these exotic tax schemes that we are constantly reading about in the pages
*  of our own newspaper that allowed the ultra wealthy to hide money or move money, sometimes in ways
*  that may be perfectly legal and might take an army of IRS specialists a very long time to prove
*  aren't legal. Right. And as one former IRS commissioner used to joke, a lot of kids don't really,
*  say when they grow up, they want to be IRS agents. So what Biden is doing is theoretically giving
*  the IRS a fighting chance at pursuing the kind of hard tax cases that I think most Americans
*  want the IRS to be focused on involving rich taxpayers and big companies. But it sounds like
*  you're saying that there's a risk here that even with these new agents and all this new money,
*  the IRS is going to find that it can't actually do that work. It's just too hard. And it's possible
*  that once again, as happened in the 90s, the IRS kind of accidentally ends up becoming the very
*  thing, this boogie man to regular Americans that politicians have accused the IRS of being all along.
*  It's definitely possible that could end up happening because there's a lot of headwinds that the
*  the administration and the IRS are still facing. Republicans in the House have already tried to
*  scale back some of the money. There's going to be very vigorous oversight and scrutiny of how it's
*  being deployed and more congressional hearings are to come. And so what a lot of people fear is that
*  could lead the IRS to being unable to live up to what the Biden administration wants it to be.
*  It's going to be a huge challenge for the IRS to bring in all these billions of dollars of
*  tax revenue to fund progressive priorities without being able to ramp up audits on Americans making
*  under $400,000. Well, Alan, thank you very much. We appreciate it. It's my pleasure. Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. On Monday, the violent battle for control of Sudan expanded,
*  killing at least 180 people and injuring more than 1800, according to a United Nations official.
*  The conflict between supporters of the country's two top generals has resulted in terrifying
*  scenes of fighter jets firing into the country's capital city and now risks drawing neighboring
*  countries like Egypt into the battle. The immediate future lies in the hands of the generals who are
*  engaged in this fight. And we call upon them to put peace first. As the fighting has intensified,
*  Western leaders, including the U.S. Secretary of State and the British Foreign Secretary,
*  have called for an immediate ceasefire and peace talks between the two sides.
*  But so far, the two generals have shown little interest in negotiation. And for the moment,
*  it's unclear who, if anyone, controls the country.
