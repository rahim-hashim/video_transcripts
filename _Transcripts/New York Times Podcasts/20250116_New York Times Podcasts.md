# A Fragile Cease-Fire in Gaza
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0)
*  Well, I've been waiting this moment for 15 months. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=0.0s)]
*  Finally, I cannot hear any drones. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=7.0s)]
*  For 15 months I've been away from seeing my daughters. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=12.0s)]
*  I'll be happy when I'm returned to North Gaza. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=18.0s)]
*  I know it's completely destroyed, but still I want to go there. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=23.0s)]
*  I want to go to see my daughters, to hug them, to feel like they are still alive. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=28.0s)]
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=42.0s)]
*  After more than a year of war, Israel and Hamas have agreed to a temporary ceasefire. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=48.0s)]
*  Relief, I guess, would be the first reaction. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=55.0s)]
*  I'll be relieved when the hostages are back in Israel. That's when I'll be relieved. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=58.0s)]
*  It prompted hope that the war could soon end. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=63.0s)]
*  I am still worried, afraid of the implementation of the ceasefire agreement. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=66.0s)]
*  But also worry that the tentative terms could easily fall apart. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=73.0s)]
*  I don't know what will happen next. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=78.0s)]
*  Today, my colleague Patrick Kingsley on why the agreement finally happened [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=82.0s)]
*  and what it means for Gaza, Israel, and the broader Middle East. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=88.0s)]
*  It's Thursday, January 16th. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=97.0s)]
*  Patrick, you've been covering this war since the very start. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=106.0s)]
*  In fact, we've had you on so many times to explain to us the developments, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=109.0s)]
*  to really educate us about what's going on there. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=113.0s)]
*  And after many failed attempts at a ceasefire, one has finally been agreed on. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=116.0s)]
*  We're speaking on Wednesday afternoon. So far, what do we know about what it says? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=122.0s)]
*  In essence, it's a three-stage ceasefire that could, if all goes well, end up being a permanent truce. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=126.0s)]
*  The first phase is the only part of the deal that is really nailed down. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=136.0s)]
*  That's a six-week phase during which 33 hostages, mostly alive but some of them dead, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=143.0s)]
*  are set to be released by Hamas and its allies who captured those hostages [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=152.0s)]
*  right at the start of the war on October 7th, 2023. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=157.0s)]
*  And in exchange, Israel is supposed to release several hundred Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=161.0s)]
*  And during that six weeks, we also expect Israeli troops to gradually withdraw, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=169.0s)]
*  allowing several hundred thousand Palestinians who were displaced from their homes in northern Gaza [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=176.0s)]
*  to tents and makeshift camps in the south of the Strip to return to their homes, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=183.0s)]
*  to move back northward to a decimated Gaza city. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=190.0s)]
*  During all of that movement and exchanges of captives, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=195.0s)]
*  there will be more negotiations to see if they can extend this initial six-week phase [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=201.0s)]
*  into another six-week phase during which the deal is supposed to become permanent [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=207.0s)]
*  and more hostages are supposed to be released for more prisoners. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=214.0s)]
*  The problem is there is still much to be negotiated about that second phase. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=220.0s)]
*  And Patrick, what still remains to be negotiated exactly? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=225.0s)]
*  There seems to be still some disagreement about where exactly Israel will withdraw from [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=230.0s)]
*  and there's enough ambiguity in there that the deal could collapse after six weeks, if not before. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=236.0s)]
*  And that ambiguity is intentional. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=243.0s)]
*  Israel and first and foremost, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=246.0s)]
*  did not want to agree to a deal that would definitively end the war. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=251.0s)]
*  Hamas had the opposite perspective. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=257.0s)]
*  They wanted a deal that would end the war for certain. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=260.0s)]
*  And so the mediators between the two sides came up with ambiguous wording [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=264.0s)]
*  that would allow each side to feel like they were getting more or less what they want. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=269.0s)]
*  The wording allows Israel to say that they can break the arrangement after six weeks. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=276.0s)]
*  And it provides the possibility for Hamas that the ceasefire will extend beyond 42 days [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=281.0s)]
*  into something permanent and that they will be able to survive the war intact as a group [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=290.0s)]
*  and in power as the governing force over Gaza. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=296.0s)]
*  Patrick, you've talked through two phases. What's the third phase? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=301.0s)]
*  The third phase would not be significantly different from the second phase, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=304.0s)]
*  but there would be final exchanges of dead bodies and other human remains, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=307.0s)]
*  as well as the start of a massive reconstruction project to rebuild the Gaza Strip over several years. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=313.0s)]
*  So why, after all these months, is this ceasefire finally happening now? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=322.0s)]
*  I think there's several factors here. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=328.0s)]
*  One, Israel is stronger. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=330.0s)]
*  Two, Hamas is weaker. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=333.0s)]
*  And three, the Trump administration is about to come into power [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=335.0s)]
*  and has put pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli leader. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=339.0s)]
*  Yeah, so let's dig into each of those points then. Why don't you start with Israel stronger? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=345.0s)]
*  Since last summer, Israel has had a series of military successes. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=350.0s)]
*  It has most obviously weakened Hamas, taken over more of the Gaza Strip, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=356.0s)]
*  destroyed more of Hamas' infrastructure, killed more Hamas leaders, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=363.0s)]
*  including Yahya Sinwar, the man who did more than anyone to mastermind [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=368.0s)]
*  the October 7th attack on Israel at the start of the war. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=373.0s)]
*  Further afield, Israel has substantially weakened Hezbollah, a key ally of Hamas in Lebanon. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=377.0s)]
*  It has weakened Hamas' main benefactor, Iran, destroying much of its air defenses. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=386.0s)]
*  And another member of the Iran-led alliance, the Syrian government, has collapsed. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=393.0s)]
*  So Prime Minister Netanyahu can present more or less the same deal to the Israeli public [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=400.0s)]
*  and in particular to his far-right allies as being less of a capitulation [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=407.0s)]
*  as it was once seen by parts of his coalition government [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=414.0s)]
*  because he and Israel are coming from a position of greater military strength. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=419.0s)]
*  And the flip side is that Hamas is therefore weaker. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=425.0s)]
*  Gaza is decimated. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=429.0s)]
*  Hamas' goal of setting off a kind of broader regional conflict [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=431.0s)]
*  that would substantially weaken Israel or perhaps even destroy it has come to nothing. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=436.0s)]
*  And the going analysis is that this has made Hamas more willing to come to the table [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=443.0s)]
*  and agree to a deal that was on that table already for several months. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=449.0s)]
*  And the third factor is the Trump factor. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=454.0s)]
*  It's the Biden administration in tandem with the Qatari government and the Egyptian government [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=457.0s)]
*  that has done most of the running in the negotiations, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=462.0s)]
*  helping to draft the details of this agreement that has just been signed [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=466.0s)]
*  and conjoining the Israeli government for more than a year towards this agreement. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=471.0s)]
*  But it seems to be the incoming Trump administration, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=478.0s)]
*  President-elect Trump himself and his incoming Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=482.0s)]
*  that have applied the pressure that has been the straw that broke the camel's back. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=487.0s)]
*  Steve Witkoff came to Israel last week, met with Netanyahu. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=493.0s)]
*  Since that meeting, the negotiations have gone from advancing fairly slowly [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=498.0s)]
*  to suddenly getting to the point of a deal being reached. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=506.0s)]
*  And it seems to be that Trump, who has said for months that he wants to see a deal [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=510.0s)]
*  by the time of his inauguration early next week, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=515.0s)]
*  may have been the decisive factor in getting this deal over the line. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=519.0s)]
*  And what exactly did Witkoff say? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=523.0s)]
*  I mean, how did he put pressure on Netanyahu that may have kind of really moved it for the Israelis here? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=526.0s)]
*  We went inside the room, so we can't say for sure, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=532.0s)]
*  but it's possible that it was some combination of carrot and stick, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=535.0s)]
*  the stick being that Trump, who's an unpredictable actor, would be very angry if a deal wasn't reached. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=538.0s)]
*  The carrot may be that the Trump administration will back Netanyahu [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=545.0s)]
*  if he decides to resume the war after six weeks. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=550.0s)]
*  That was less likely under President Biden, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=555.0s)]
*  but it's seen as being potentially more likely under a Trump administration [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=558.0s)]
*  who might grant greater leeway to Israel in Gaza than President Biden. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=564.0s)]
*  The reverse could also be true. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=571.0s)]
*  Having helped to author this deal, the Trump administration may see its reputation [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=573.0s)]
*  as being tied to its success and may place more pressure on Netanyahu in several weeks. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=578.0s)]
*  And we await to see which of those two outcomes will be the case. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=586.0s)]
*  So is the Trump envoy working directly with the Biden people on this? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=591.0s)]
*  That's been one of the more remarkable aspects of the recent days of negotiations. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=597.0s)]
*  You've had representatives of two administrations that really don't see eye to eye [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=602.0s)]
*  and have very different visions of American democracy joining forces to get this deal over the line. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=607.0s)]
*  The Biden administration has led the way in drafting and wrangling over many of the details [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=614.0s)]
*  over so many months in these negotiations. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=620.0s)]
*  It's Trump's Middle East envoy who appears to have played a major role [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=623.0s)]
*  in getting this deal suddenly over the line in recent days. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=627.0s)]
*  So those are the mechanics of the deal, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=632.0s)]
*  and we are left with questions about how exactly those mechanics will play out. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=636.0s)]
*  And we're also left with questions about what all this means in the long term [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=641.0s)]
*  for Israelis, for Palestinians in Gaza, in the West Bank, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=647.0s)]
*  and also for the region, the Middle East as a whole. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=653.0s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=668.0s)]
*  So, Patrick, how should we understand this deal and what it means for Gazans, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=670.0s)]
*  for Hamas, for Israel, and really for the world? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=675.0s)]
*  For Gazans, it is, at least for a few weeks, respite from one of the most intense aerial campaigns [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=678.0s)]
*  and ground invasions, certainly in the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=687.0s)]
*  but also in 21st century warfare. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=691.0s)]
*  And even if this deal comes to an end, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=693.0s)]
*  it gives them the opportunity to have a night's sleep without bombardment. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=697.0s)]
*  It gives people a chance to find their loved ones whose corpses have been trapped on the rubble [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=703.0s)]
*  for months, in some cases over a year. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=708.0s)]
*  It gives hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in southern Gaza [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=711.0s)]
*  the ability to finally, after more than a year of displacement, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=716.0s)]
*  return home to northern Gaza. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=720.0s)]
*  Scores of universities, hospitals, medical centers have been destroyed during this war, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=723.0s)]
*  and it could even take decades to repair some of that damage. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=730.0s)]
*  And, Patrick, who will do all of that rebuilding? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=735.0s)]
*  So, Hamas is a movement, and the Hamas-controlled Gaza movement [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=739.0s)]
*  So, Hamas is a movement, and the Hamas-controlled Gaza authorities [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=745.0s)]
*  don't really have the ability to do much of this on their own. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=751.0s)]
*  They're going to rely on massive overseas help from the rest of the Arab world, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=754.0s)]
*  from the United Nations, and exactly how that is going to work has not yet been decided. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=759.0s)]
*  And, Patrick, what about Hamas in the context of this deal? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=766.0s)]
*  What does the deal mean for that group? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=771.0s)]
*  The deal gives them the chance of survival. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=774.0s)]
*  As the war went on, they were losing more troops, more operatives, more leaders. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=777.0s)]
*  Their top leader, Yahya Sinwar, was killed, if you recall, in October. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=784.0s)]
*  Sinwar's predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed also in the summer. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=790.0s)]
*  Now that the war has stopped, at least for now, and that there's a possibility [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=796.0s)]
*  that the initial six-week ceasefire will extend into something longer, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=800.0s)]
*  they may be able to survive the war both intact as a movement [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=804.0s)]
*  and in power as a governing force in the Gaza Strip. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=809.0s)]
*  Which is pretty remarkable, given where we started, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=813.0s)]
*  which was Israel saying that Hamas would be eliminated from the Gaza Strip. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=817.0s)]
*  They said words to that effect. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=823.0s)]
*  After the October 7th raid by Hamas and its allies, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=825.0s)]
*  Israel basically said its two goals of the war would be to return the hostages [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=828.0s)]
*  captured by Hamas and its allies on October 7th [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=832.0s)]
*  and to destroy Hamas's military capabilities and its governing capabilities. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=837.0s)]
*  If they are still able to govern the Gaza Strip after the war ends, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=842.0s)]
*  or if the ceasefire becomes a permanent one, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=847.0s)]
*  then that would represent something of a victory for the group, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=850.0s)]
*  even if their actions have resulted in the decimation of the territory [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=855.0s)]
*  that they controlled before the war began. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=862.0s)]
*  So to that point, what about Israel? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=866.0s)]
*  What does this deal mean for Israel? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=870.0s)]
*  In the short term, it brings also some respite, also some joy, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=873.0s)]
*  to an Israeli society that has been traumatized, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=879.0s)]
*  both by the October 7th attacks, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=882.0s)]
*  which were the deadliest attacks on Israel in its history, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=885.0s)]
*  but also by the 466 days since, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=888.0s)]
*  in which Israelis have been torn by guilt and sadness [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=892.0s)]
*  over the continued incarceration of their friends, relatives in Gaza. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=897.0s)]
*  And if at least some of those hostages can be released, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=904.0s)]
*  it counts as a kind of redemption, not only for the hostages themselves, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=908.0s)]
*  but for Israelis across the political spectrum. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=913.0s)]
*  Longer term, if the deal holds and Netanyahu decides to continue it [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=917.0s)]
*  and to nudge it towards something permanent, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=924.0s)]
*  then it could severely destabilize his own coalition government. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=927.0s)]
*  He is in power in part through the support of several far-right ministers [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=933.0s)]
*  and lawmakers who deeply oppose ending the war with Hamas still in power, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=940.0s)]
*  even if that means leaving some hostages inside Gaza. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=945.0s)]
*  So if he does agree to take this from a six-week deal into a longer arrangement, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=950.0s)]
*  they could leave his coalition potentially destabilizing it, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=956.0s)]
*  or maybe even collapsing it, which could lead to early elections, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=960.0s)]
*  and perhaps, depending on the results of those elections, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=964.0s)]
*  a transition of power within Israeli society. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=968.0s)]
*  So short term, this brings relief and joy for Israelis as well as people in Gaza. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=972.0s)]
*  In the long term, it could deepen some of the divides that we've seen [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=979.0s)]
*  split Israeli society for many different reasons in recent years. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=983.0s)]
*  You said that one of the reasons we're here in this moment talking about a ceasefire now [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=988.0s)]
*  is because Israel is actually in a stronger position today. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=994.0s)]
*  And it makes me wonder about its position in the broader region. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=999.0s)]
*  As you said, a lot of Hamas' allies have been weakened. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1003.0s)]
*  So do you think that through this war, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1006.0s)]
*  Israel is ultimately in a more powerful position now in the region? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1009.0s)]
*  Yes and no. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1015.0s)]
*  In reputational terms, Israel has dealt itself damage [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1017.0s)]
*  by the way it has been perceived to conduct this war. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1023.0s)]
*  It is accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1028.0s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu, as well as his former defense minister, Yohav Gallant, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1032.0s)]
*  are wanted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1036.0s)]
*  There has been criticism of Israel almost like never before [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1042.0s)]
*  as a result of the way it's conducted its war in Gaza. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1047.0s)]
*  And in that sense, you could argue it has lost or it has at least lost ground [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1052.0s)]
*  in a diplomatic war, a war for legitimacy and a war for reputation. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1057.0s)]
*  But is that important to Israel at all? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1064.0s)]
*  I mean, the diplomacy, you know, okay, there's the reputation, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1066.0s)]
*  but it's not fundamentally related to its power in the region in winning, right? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1070.0s)]
*  So Israel depends on international support for at least some of its actions. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1076.0s)]
*  It depends on American funds and American military resources, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1083.0s)]
*  ammunition, fighter jets, in order to wage its wars. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1089.0s)]
*  And within the Middle East, it depends on good relations with the Arab world [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1094.0s)]
*  in order to cement its long-term status within the region. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1099.0s)]
*  Before the war, Israel was close to forging a landmark diplomatic deal [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1104.0s)]
*  between itself and Saudi Arabia, the most influential country in the Arab world. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1110.0s)]
*  The war put those negotiations on ice and in fact made it much harder for Saudi Arabia [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1118.0s)]
*  to be seen to be doing a deal with a country that many people in the Arab world [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1124.0s)]
*  believe is committing a genocide against Palestinians. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1129.0s)]
*  And if the war ends, Israelis will hope that they can get those negotiations back on track. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1133.0s)]
*  But militarily, yes, as you say, Israel has weakened Hamas, they've weakened Hezbollah, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1142.0s)]
*  they have weakened Iran, and all of those battles contributed at least in some part [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1151.0s)]
*  to the collapse of Iran's ally, the Syrian government. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1158.0s)]
*  And so Israel, despite all its internal divisions, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1162.0s)]
*  has proved itself as the region's strongest military power. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1167.0s)]
*  It means, or at least Israelis will hope it means, whatever reputational loss Israel has suffered [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1173.0s)]
*  because of the conduct of its war in Gaza, both in the Middle East and across the world, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1180.0s)]
*  it is simply too powerful militarily to be wished away. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1186.0s)]
*  And that whatever the anger many people within the Middle East feel towards Israel, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1191.0s)]
*  their leaders will feel that Israel is a country that they have to work with, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1197.0s)]
*  precisely because it is such a military force. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1204.0s)]
*  Patrick, thank you. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1217.0s)]
*  Thank you, Sabrina. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1219.0s)]
*  On Thursday, last-minute disputes delayed a vote by Israel's cabinet that would ratify the ceasefire. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1228.0s)]
*  Netanyahu's office accused Hamas of reneging on parts of it, a charge that Hamas denied. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1235.0s)]
*  Despite the last-minute wrangling, the agreement is expected to eventually take effect. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1241.0s)]
*  It will begin on Sunday, with Hamas releasing some hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1246.0s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1258.0s)]
*  Here's what you should know today. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1265.0s)]
*  On a busy day of confirmation hearings for Donald Trump's cabinet, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1267.0s)]
*  his pick for attorney general, Pam Bondi, faced tough questions from Democrats [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1271.0s)]
*  about whether she could stand up to the president-elect and operate independently from him. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1276.0s)]
*  So my questions now are, can you tell her truth to the president? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1282.0s)]
*  So let me start with an easy truth that you could speak to the president. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1286.0s)]
*  Can you tell us, can you tell him that Donald Trump lost the 2020 election? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1290.0s)]
*  Can you say that? Do you have the independence to say that? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1297.0s)]
*  Do you have the gravitas, the stature, the intestinal fortitude to say, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1299.0s)]
*  Donald Trump, you lost the 2020 election? Can you tell us that here today? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1303.0s)]
*  Senator, what I can tell you is I will never play politics. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1308.0s)]
*  You're trying to engage me in a gotcha. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1312.0s)]
*  I want to ask you a simple question. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1314.0s)]
*  Bondi repeatedly dodged questions about whether she agreed with Donald Trump's false claim [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1316.0s)]
*  that the 2020 election was stolen and whether she would support his plan to pardon January 6 rioters. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1321.0s)]
*  Are the felons convicted of breaking into the Capitol on January 6th, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1328.0s)]
*  hostages or patriots, as President-elect Trump has said repeatedly? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1333.0s)]
*  I said repeatedly, do you agree with his characterization of the felons that I referred to? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1338.0s)]
*  I am not familiar with that statement, Senator. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1344.0s)]
*  I just familiarized you with that statement. Do you agree with that statement? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1347.0s)]
*  I'm not familiar with it, Senator. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1352.0s)]
*  Bondi is expected to be confirmed in the coming days. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1354.0s)]
*  And... [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1358.0s)]
*  Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1360.0s)]
*  that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1366.0s)]
*  and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1372.0s)]
*  Speaking to the American public for the final time before departing office on Monday, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1375.0s)]
*  President Joe Biden described what he said were his gravest concerns before receding into life as a private citizen. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1380.0s)]
*  Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1388.0s)]
*  enabling the abuse of power. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1395.0s)]
*  In a clear rebuke of Metta's decision to end its fact-checking program, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK0749Tgtr0&t=1397.0s)]
