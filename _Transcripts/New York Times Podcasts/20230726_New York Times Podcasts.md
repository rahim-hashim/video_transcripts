# Hunter Bidenâ€™s Day in Court
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3odSghamxI)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  This morning, when Hunter Biden enters a guilty plea in a Delaware courtroom, it will mark
*  the end of a years-long federal investigation that many Republicans believed would put the
*  president's son in prison and put an end to the Biden presidency.
*  Today, my colleague Mike Schmidt on why none of that has happened.
*  It's Wednesday, July 26th.
*  So Mike, for the past several years, we've come to understand that the president's son,
*  Hunter Biden, was under federal investigation in a case that had become profoundly politicized.
*  And today, as that investigation wraps up, Hunter Biden will enter a plea deal.
*  So set that scene for us.
*  In a few hours, Hunter Biden will walk into a federal courtroom in Delaware, and he will
*  plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges.
*  Essentially, he did not pay his taxes, pretty big tax bills, for two years.
*  And he will admit to having lied to the federal government when he purchased a handgun, because
*  when he bought that handgun, he, like every American that tries to buy a gun, is asked,
*  are you using drugs at this point?
*  Like on a form?
*  Correct.
*  He had to fill out a form, and he checked the box that he had not been using drugs.
*  When in fact, he had.
*  Correct.
*  Okay.
*  And what kind of charge is that?
*  You said the first two were misdemeanors.
*  The third thing is this unusual resolution of sorts of a criminal matter.
*  It's called a diversion agreement.
*  They are going to divert the prosecution of him on this charge.
*  And if he stays clean for two years, and he continues to not own a gun, he will never
*  be prosecuted on it.
*  Okay.
*  So in totality, when he enters this plea deal for the three issues you just raised, what
*  kind of a prison sentence is he looking at?
*  If everything goes according to plan, basically the agreement worked out by the defense lawyers
*  and the prosecutors, he will not go to prison for any time.
*  So we're looking here at the president's son entering a plea deal for a couple of misdemeanors
*  and not going to be serving any prison time whatsoever.
*  That doesn't seem like all that big a prosecution.
*  In fact, it seems like a very small prosecution.
*  Is that what we had expected?
*  Well, if you were a reporter who was trying to figure out what was going on here for
*  the past several months and several years, this is not a surprise.
*  But if you are a Republican or a Donald Trump supporter or someone who has been ingesting
*  a lot of Donald Trump and conservative media, then this is a very surprising outcome.
*  Hmm.
*  This was going to be the criminal matter that was going to expose not only Biden's family
*  members, but the president himself as being someone that had taken money from foreigners
*  to change American policy, someone who was completely compromised by his foreign ties.
*  And that this whole matter was going to end the Biden family and essentially allow Donald
*  Trump to become president again.
*  Right.
*  It was going all the way to the top.
*  And it was basically the Watergate of the Biden era in the eyes and the imagination
*  of the conservative movement.
*  It was going to end this five decade long political career of Joe Biden.
*  Which is not what happened or anything close to it.
*  So help us understand, Mike, what Hunter Biden actually did, why it ever triggered a federal
*  investigation and why for so many Americans who, as you said, were ingesting this Republican
*  approach to this case, the thought was that it would ever become something that big and
*  important.
*  So in some ways, it's just the story of a father and his son.
*  Hunter Biden is the second son of Joe Biden, and he ended up becoming a lobbyist.
*  He made a fair amount of money in the early 2000s in that job.
*  But then his father becomes vice president and he stopped his lobbying work.
*  Probably because his father became vice president.
*  The optics were too complicated to be a lobbyist and have your father as vice president.
*  But Hunter Biden had a lifestyle that he needed to fund and maintain.
*  So in an attempt to keep that lifestyle, he heads down a different path.
*  Which was?
*  Hunter Biden was going to find opportunities abroad where he could advise and consult.
*  Which kind of sounds just as problematic as lobbying when your dad is VP, but for some
*  reason he thought that was the better route.
*  So he heads down this path with a business partner and reaches these consulting contracts,
*  these deals with foreigners.
*  What kind of deals?
*  Give us some examples.
*  The most important high profile one of them all was with a Ukrainian energy company called
*  Burisma.
*  Burisma had a lot of problems.
*  They were accused of being corrupt.
*  When the Obama administration, with Joe Biden leading the charge, was supporting investigations
*  into Burisma as part of an international anti-corruption push.
*  And so Burisma was trying to fix their reputation and their issues abroad and in the United
*  States.
*  And it's around this time that they hired Hunter Biden to be on their board.
*  So this is a pretty sticky wicket, as they say, from the get go.
*  In Washington, where optics on conflicts of interest are really important and taken very
*  seriously, this is not something that looks so kosher.
*  And it raised concerns inside the then Obama administration about what was really going
*  on here.
*  So what ends up happening with this messy arrangement?
*  So Hunter Biden, probably not someone that strikes you as a Ukraine or energy expert,
*  it's a job paying him $600,000 a year to be on this board, to consult and advise and be
*  a board member.
*  So this is kind of what it looks like it is, right?
*  Burisma has probably hired Hunter Biden with the idea that he might help them get out of
*  some of the sticky situations they're in knowing that his dad is vice president.
*  Why else would they pay him that much money?
*  It raises some darn good old fashioned good government questions like, okay, you have
*  a vice president of the United States.
*  He has a son.
*  What should that son be able to do to pursue his own career in a way that is fair to the
*  son but also doesn't tarnish American foreign policy?
*  Right.
*  And there are a lot of potentially great options out there.
*  And this probably isn't the best one.
*  This is a smack dab, fair question.
*  Should the vice president's son be doing this?
*  Does it compromise American foreign policy and American efforts to do what it wants to
*  do abroad?
*  So because of this dynamic, because of Hunter Biden's Ukraine dealings, it casts a shadow
*  over everything that Joe Biden does in regards to Ukraine, including his efforts to have
*  a prosecutor removed who was looking at Burisma.
*  Right.
*  And I remember this.
*  It was because according to Biden and Obama, that prosecutor wasn't being vigilant enough
*  in his pursuit of corruption.
*  It just takes the situation and it says, okay, what's really going on here?
*  Maybe for reasons that are legitimate, maybe for reasons that aren't.
*  And like, what does Biden say throughout this period about what his relationship is to his
*  son Hunter's work when it comes to Ukraine?
*  He says he has no relation to his son's work, but he really doesn't have to address it because
*  it's not a big public issue.
*  Right.
*  Because he's just vice president.
*  He's vice president.
*  It's the end of the administration and he's not running for president in 2017.
*  But then all of a sudden he is by 2020.
*  So bring us to that point in the story.
*  So by 2018 and 2019, Donald Trump realizes that he's going to be running for reelection
*  and the person who he thinks is most likely to beat him is Joe Biden.
*  Now, when Biden's son walks away with millions of dollars from Ukraine and he knows nothing
*  and they're paying him millions of dollars, that's corruption.
*  And Trump starts to raise the issue of Joe Biden, Hunter Biden and Burisma.
*  Well I think Biden is going down and I think his whole situation because now you may very
*  well find that there are many other countries that they scam.
*  Trump comes up with an argument that Joe Biden is corrupt because of this.
*  What Biden did is a disgrace.
*  What his son did is a disgrace.
*  The son took money from Ukraine.
*  The son took money from China.
*  He starts to pressure his Justice Department to do something about this.
*  So I would say that President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start
*  an investigation into the Bidens.
*  When he dispatches his longtime lawyer and confidant, Rudy Giuliani, to Ukraine to go
*  gather evidence that can then be brought back to the United States Justice Department to
*  be used in a prosecution.
*  As Trump is casting about for any way to raise this, he has his now infamous perfect phone
*  call with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.
*  Right.
*  In which he says, I would really appreciate it if you could get to the bottom of the Joe
*  Biden, Hunter Biden, Burisma story for me.
*  By the way, it might make a big difference in terms of some of that aid that the U.S.
*  sends to you.
*  At the same time that he's holding up much needed aid to prevent the Russians from overrunning
*  the country.
*  Right.
*  This, of course, becomes the basis for the first congressional impeachment of Donald
*  Trump.
*  Correct.
*  Trump's first impeachment.
*  Right.
*  As Trump is kicking up all this stuff about Hunter, a real Justice Department investigation
*  is taking hold.
*  The Justice Department officials in Washington took all the questions about Hunter Biden
*  and they gave them to the Trump appointed United States attorney in Delaware, David
*  Weiss, to look into.
*  And this is 2000?
*  This is starting in 2018 into 19.
*  So as Trump is trying to get Rudy Giuliani to gallivant the world looking for evidence
*  and is getting impeached for all this stuff, whatever, these federal prosecutors are digging
*  into Hunter Biden's life.
*  Got it.
*  So they're starting this examination basically of everything that Hunter Biden has done.
*  All of the deals, all of his foreign interactions, all of his taxes, everything.
*  They're looking at his entire life.
*  And it's not known publicly that this is going on.
*  Hmm.
*  It feels like, Mike, this is the moment where two universes start to diverge.
*  In one universe, like you said, there's an unseen federal investigation going on trying
*  to figure out what is the what with Hunter Biden.
*  And in the other universe, because you say it's 2019, Trump is running for reelection
*  and eventually against Joe Biden.
*  And he's, as you say, kicking up all this stuff, spreading claims.
*  What you're trying to say, I think, is that look, there's the political and there's the
*  law enforcement.
*  So politically, Donald Trump is out there saying Joe Biden and his son are corrupt and
*  it's all because of Ukraine.
*  On the other hand, where no one can see, off to the side are these prosecutors who are
*  beginning to look at every aspect of Hunter Biden's life.
*  Right.
*  And the one we, the public sees, is the Trump one.
*  And it becomes a drumbeat because of it's coming up at major moments in the campaign.
*  Hunter, you know nothing about energy.
*  You know nothing about you.
*  You know nothing about anything, frankly.
*  Hunter, you're a loser.
*  Why did you get one point five billion dollars, Hunter?
*  This is a major tenant of his stump speeches and interviews and tweets and everything.
*  What did he do with Burisma to deserve $183,000?
*  It becomes so at the forefront of the campaign that Donald Trump, at one of the debates,
*  raises the question of Hunter's conduct.
*  Did Burisma pay him $183,000 a month with no experience in energy?
*  My son did nothing wrong at Burisma.
*  I think he did.
*  Mr. President.
*  The only guy that thinks that.
*  By the man?
*  As much as Biden was adamant that there was nothing to what Trump was saying, Trump is
*  essentially seeding the country with notions of Hunter Biden's conduct.
*  All right, another day, another explosive report surrounding zero experience Hunter Biden.
*  He's kicking off all these different ideas and theories and conspiracy theories and allegations
*  that are covered widely in the conservative media.
*  And it's not just about Hunter Biden.
*  It's now about Joe Biden, as he now appears to have put national security at risk so that
*  his family could cash in and make millions.
*  Hunter Biden and his business partners helped rich Chinese investors and members of the
*  Chinese Communist Party obtain meetings with then Vice President Joe Biden.
*  There's a money-ordering case that I could prove in four minutes of $14 million involving
*  the Bidens.
*  As Trump, in the final weeks of the election, is looking for any way to get the upper hand
*  in an election he knows he's losing, something of a gift for him appears.
*  The evidence is not just there, it's overwhelming.
*  And that was Hunter Biden's laptop.
*  So Hunter Biden had struggled mightily with addiction.
*  He hit a low point in 2018 where he was smoking crack with strangers.
*  In the midst of that, he had dropped off his laptop, which he thought he damaged with water
*  at a repair shop in Delaware.
*  He never went back to pick it up.
*  By the summer of 2020, the height of the 2020 campaign, that laptop is in the hands of Rudy
*  Giuliani.
*  And Trump and Giuliani think that they have the October surprise that will keep Trump
*  in office.
*  Right.
*  They believe that whatever is on that laptop is the key to unlocking what they have long
*  believed and told their supporters is the true corrupt nature of the relationship between
*  Hunter, Joe Biden, and all the work Hunter's doing.
*  It's going to be there in some email.
*  And the laptop is not pretty.
*  Its contents are very ugly.
*  Because what it is, is a lot of photos and messages Hunter Biden took and sent at the
*  height of his addiction.
*  But does that laptop end up containing anything that shows something we didn't already know
*  about his relationship to his dad and his business?
*  It doesn't go much further than these major questions that have hung over Hunter Biden's
*  businesses.
*  But of course, this does not end up being an October surprise that changes the dynamic
*  of this election.
*  Trump loses.
*  Now, famously, doesn't accept that fact, but loses.
*  But there is, if you're Trump, and you want this story to not go away, the reality that
*  a federal investigation is still going on in the background.
*  Yeah, but Trump didn't know that.
*  He didn't.
*  In the weeks after the election, Hunter Biden puts out a statement and says, I'm the subject
*  of an IRS tax investigation.
*  And Donald Trump says, what the heck?
*  I didn't know about this.
*  I didn't know about the federal investigation.
*  The Attorney General Bill Barr had kept it from Trump.
*  And Trump is furious with Barr for not having publicized it to help him in the lead up to
*  the election.
*  So as Donald Trump is heading off stage, the only hope that he and the right have that
*  Hunter Biden is going to take down Joe Biden is this still ongoing investigation in Delaware.
*  But Trump and the right now have an issue.
*  That investigation will now be overseen by Joe Biden's Justice Department and his handpicked
*  attorney general.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Mike, what happens once this federal investigation leaves the Trump administration and is inherited
*  by President Biden's Justice Department?
*  So for Biden, he knows, it's clear as day, that if he tries to meddle in this at all,
*  he's going to get crushed for it.
*  So he is going to go to great pains to ensure that he has no influence or the appearance
*  of that influence over the investigation.
*  And what does that look like?
*  The great pains that Biden and his administration go to to preserve the independence of the
*  Hunter Biden investigation?
*  So the attorney general Merrick Garland, without consulting Joe Biden, keeps on that prosecutor
*  in Delaware.
*  David Weiss, who was appointed by Trump.
*  Which is a little unusual, as I understand it, new presidents of different parties come
*  in, they often replace all the US attorneys, they kept this guy on.
*  They keep this guy on because he is going to finish the Hunter Biden investigation.
*  And they thought this was the best way to insulate that investigation from the appearance
*  of politics.
*  And so what does this US attorney from Delaware?
*  What does he ultimately find?
*  And what do we end up learning about how much investigating he's actually been doing?
*  Because as you said, this is all going on in the background.
*  So Weiss turns over every rock, or pretty much every rock in Hunter Biden's life, particularly
*  from this period of time when he was addicted to drugs, and was engaging in these risky,
*  unusual dealings with foreigners.
*  And while the accusations and the things that Trump said were grandiose, remember, this
*  was the investigation that was going to expose the Biden family as criminally corrupt.
*  This investigation by Weiss that looks at all these different things, ends up narrowing
*  to questions of Hunter Biden's taxes and this purchase of a gun that he made in 2018.
*  And Mike, what's our understanding of why the investigation narrows so dramatically?
*  Why after turning over every rock, looking at every deal, whether it was the Burisma
*  deal or deals like that, that Weiss turns to what kind of feels like pretty pedestrian
*  criminal issues?
*  So if you accept Weiss's investigation at face value, it's that he looked at all these
*  things and while they may raise these good old fashioned government questions of appearance
*  of impropriety or why is this elected official's son doing these deals, there's no criminality there.
*  Right, can be ugly and still be legal.
*  Correct.
*  But because he's turned over the rocks in Hunter Biden's life from a particularly rocky
*  period of time, he finds some stuff that isn't kosher.
*  Right, the tax issue is the gun issue.
*  And Mike, I wonder, how do prosecutors normally think about crimes or alleged crimes like those?
*  So legal experts will give you all sorts of opinions, but my reporting on this shows that
*  these crimes are usually not charged.
*  Why not?
*  Because they're too small.
*  They're too small, Boar.
*  They're typically dealt with through a civil fine.
*  But Weiss finds himself in a situation where he has found criminality that the president's
*  son has engaged in.
*  So is it the best thing for justice to avert your gaze of that criminality?
*  What does that say?
*  Hmm.
*  So this is an interesting case where because the investigation has gone on for so long
*  and has dug around in so many corners, it's pretty hard to not charge Hunter Biden with
*  anything politically speaking, even when the things he can be charged with might not normally
*  merit federal prosecutorial charges.
*  Correct.
*  That's the weird position that Weiss is in.
*  And I guess the weird position that Hunter Biden gets in.
*  This is kind of a strange case where Hunter Biden's name and the position he's in are
*  not helping him the way perhaps they did with this deal with Burisma, but are hurting him
*  when it comes to being charged with crimes that might be, as you say, kind of small.
*  Correct.
*  But of course, Republicans obviously don't see it this way.
*  This case has turned out for them to be a major, major disappointment given their expectations
*  for how it would turn out and the way they've talked about it.
*  Because they've been gnawing on this Hunter Biden bone for many years now.
*  And now they're being told that Hunter Biden is going to plead guilty to two misdemeanor
*  tax charges and have a diversion agreement on the purchase of a weapon.
*  Right.
*  And being told that by a Republican appointed U.S. attorney, no less.
*  So the fix must have been it.
*  In Republicans' minds.
*  Right.
*  So how are they approaching this case now that, you know, in the minds of the Justice
*  Department, it's kind of over?
*  So Republicans had wrestled back control of the House earlier this year.
*  That has allowed them investigative power in the ability to promote what they want to
*  promote and raise what they want to raise.
*  Want to welcome everyone here today.
*  In the course of that, they've focused themselves back on Hunter Biden.
*  Today we have two brave, incredible Irish whistleblowers who have risked their careers
*  to come forward and provide important testimony.
*  And they've done that with the help of IRS investigators who were originally working
*  on this case.
*  IRS investigators who got drawn into it because of the allegations that Hunter Biden didn't
*  pay his taxes.
*  Correct.
*  My name is Gary Shapley.
*  I worked as a special agent for IRS criminal investigation for 14 years.
*  Based on my experience, I'm here to tell you that the Delaware U.S. Attorney's Office and
*  Department of Justice handling the Hunter Biden tax investigation was very different
*  from any other case in my 14 years at the IRS.
*  Two IRS investigators supported by House Republicans have come forward claiming they
*  are whistleblowers and that there was political interference.
*  So they've opened up a whole new chapter in the Hunter Biden saga by accusing the Justice
*  Department under both Attorney General Barr when Trump was president and Attorney General
*  Merrick Garland when Biden came in, of treating Hunter Biden differently because he was
*  the son of a former vice president and a president.
*  In April 2022, in a hearing, Attorney General Garland was asked how the American people
*  could be confident the administration was conducting a serious investigation into the
*  president's own son.
*  Attorney General Garland responded by saying, because we put the investigation in the hands
*  of a Trump appointee.
*  He led Congress to believe the case was insulated from improper political influence because
*  all decisions were being made exclusively by Delaware United States Attorney David Weiss,
*  but that was not true.
*  Their most salacious allegation is that Weiss, the Trump appointed US attorney, did not really
*  have the full authority to bring whatever charges he wanted.
*  I watched United States Attorney Weiss tell a roomful of senior FBI and IRS senior leaders
*  on October 7th, 2022 that he was not the deciding person on whether charges were filed.
*  That was my red line.
*  The notion that when Attorney General Garland said Weiss has the ability to do what he wants
*  with this investigation, that that wasn't true.
*  If there's no further business without objection, the committee stands adjourned.
*  But it doesn't appear like that's the case.
*  Weiss, in letters to Congress, has said that he did have full authority to do what he wanted
*  to do with this investigation and that there's nothing to the allegations.
*  So this has become a bit of a, he said, he said, between the whistleblowers and Weiss.
*  Yes, but with the Republicans holding up the whistleblowers as the truth tellers and as
*  evidence that the fix was in.
*  So what should we make of what this has become since Weiss more or less ended his investigation
*  with a plea deal that we're about to see in court today and the Congressional Republicans
*  picked it up and said, no, no, no, we're going to get to the bottom of this and have started
*  to kind of fling around whistleblower testimony.
*  How should we think about that?
*  I'm not sure.
*  I think the one thing that I've learned is that every time that you think the Hunter
*  story is over, there's something else.
*  So in this case, you had a years long investigation, looked at all the stuff in Hunter Biden's
*  life, right?
*  And last month it was announced that he was going to plead guilty and that there was a
*  resolution to all of this.
*  And then the whistleblower stuff came out.
*  And now that has taken on a life of its own.
*  So while it looks like when Hunter Biden walks into court today, it's the end.
*  As someone that has followed this, whether you're going all the way back to Trump trying
*  to get the Ukrainians to investigate Hunter Biden or guilty plea in Delaware today, it
*  just seems to keep on going.
*  So we may very well end up in a year or so in a situation where there's a rerun of four
*  years ago presidential debates.
*  Joe Biden's on stage with Donald Trump and Donald Trump is accusing Joe Biden of being
*  involved in some sort of criminality with Hunter Biden, even though the Justice Department
*  has looked at all those claims and decided there's nothing to prosecute.
*  Without taking many leaps or liberties, it's pretty clear that the Hunter Biden story is
*  going to be something that Republicans and Trump are not going to be able to resist seizing
*  on.
*  Because remember, Donald Trump has been indicted by the Biden Justice Department on a slew
*  of felony charges that have exposed him to many years in prison.
*  So is it that far fetched to think that Donald Trump will be back on that debate stage with
*  Joe Biden saying, your Justice Department laid on the brakes for your son at the same time
*  that it charged me.
*  And so the Hunter Biden story will keep going and going.
*  Mike, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  On Tuesday, in a last minute maneuver, congressional Republicans and conservative activists sought
*  to intervene in Hunter Biden's plea deal, filing legal briefs that urge the judge in
*  the case to throw out the agreement that Hunter Biden reached with prosecutors.
*  The Times reports that the maneuver is unlikely to succeed, but highlights the extraordinary
*  lengths that Republicans will go to keep the Hunter Biden story in the national spotlight.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Tuesday, a federal judge struck down the Biden administration's latest plan to reduce
*  illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border, a plan that the Biden administration says has
*  been working.
*  The plan, put in place in May, punished migrants who crossed the border illegally and rewarded
*  those who scheduled appointments to seek asylum.
*  As a result, border crossings fell sharply over the past few months.
*  But the judge said that the policy violated federal law, which says that foreigners who
*  reach U.S. soil are entitled to request asylum, no matter how they entered the country.
*  And, the U.S. Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation into Harvard
*  University's policy of giving preference to the relatives of alumni and donors when
*  admitting students.
*  The investigation appears to stem from a complaint filed by activists who argue that the Harvard
*  policy, known as legacy admissions, illegally discriminates against Black, Hispanic, and
*  Asian applicants in favor of wealthy students who were less qualified.
