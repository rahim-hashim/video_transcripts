# One Strongman, One Billion Voters, and the Future of India
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVgQyxLaTWo)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  India, the world's largest democracy, is in the midst of a national election, and India's
*  prime minister, Narendra Modi, is running to extend his 10 years in power.
*  Modi has become one of the most consequential leaders in India's history, but he is also
*  one of its most controversial, drawing criticism for anti-democratic practices and charges
*  of religious persecution.
*  Today, my colleague, Mujeeb Mashal, on the many Narendra Modi's, and which one India
*  will get in his historic third term?
*  It's Thursday, May 9th.
*  So Mujeeb, you are covering India's elections, which is, of course, an enormous undertaking.
*  It's a country of over a billion people, so the election takes weeks.
*  And we are right now in the middle of that process.
*  So first of all, where do things stand now in the race?
*  Well, it's hard to know exactly right now.
*  There's so much noise around the campaigning and both sides.
*  Prime Minister Modi and his opposition are pitching their side.
*  But most observers expect Modi to be the favorite in this race because of his own popularity.
*  This race has become a test of the popularity of a leader who has been in power for 10 years
*  and who has a confidence that even if his party is struggling, his popularity can lift
*  up their chances.
*  And that's what I want to talk to you about, his popularity.
*  I want to understand how that fits with the other thing I think of when I think of Modi,
*  which is his authoritarian tendencies.
*  And the last time you and I talked, it was after a political assassination in Canada
*  that had been traced back to Modi's government.
*  So how is it that Modi has managed to become such a prominent, durable figure in India,
*  in the world's largest democracy?
*  So I've been in India for over three years now.
*  And one of the central questions that has fascinated me is exactly that.
*  He just has this enormous grip over the imagination of what is a hugely diverse country,
*  the number of languages, the number of ethnicities, the number of religions, you know,
*  across 1.4 billion people and in a huge geography.
*  But he just has this talent of making them feel one, making them feel united as a new India
*  that he imagines.
*  And he's put himself at the center of reimagining what it means to be Indian in this age.
*  And how is he doing that, Mujeeb?
*  A lot of it comes from the fact that he knows this country very well, that he's traveled,
*  he's spent time across the districts.
*  So he understands, I think, the pulse of this country very well.
*  But he also does it by using technology, by using both old and new methods, by constantly
*  painting narratives that project India as this one nation on the march.
*  And one of the ways he does that is through this monthly radio show that he has.
*  A monthly radio show, kind of like FDR's Fireside Chat?
*  Sort of, but a lot more personal in the way that he draws on his own story that most Indians
*  are very familiar with.
*  That here's a man very much like them, that he comes from a really humble economic
*  background. You know, his father was a tea seller, also in India's rigid caste hierarchy.
*  He is not from the top communities and also that he has dedicated his life almost entirely
*  to what he says is his nation, the national cause.
*  He doesn't have a family.
*  He was married at one point, but he sort of separated from his wife and he never talks
*  about it. He always projects himself as a bachelor who around the clock only thinks
*  about India. And this comes into the radio show.
*  The range of topics that he discusses.
*  From health to food and nutrition to transport.
*  To technology.
*  It's almost like telling the listeners that all his time is spent thinking about all
*  the issues that could pertain to their lives.
*  He's got advice for them.
*  He's got thoughts for them.
*  And the way he does it is in a very personable way.
*  Where he has callers connect, where he jokes, where he references the places he's
*  visited in the country.
*  He makes it very relatable across a huge nation.
*  And he goes into issues that might be very local to a community.
*  And then he tries to connect it to a national narrative.
*  And then he goes to issues that are very cross-cutting.
*  For example, exam preparations.
*  Right. This is a country that cares about its studies.
*  And every year around the exam period, Modi becomes their favorite exam tutor.
*  He does this on the radio show, but he does a special broadcast.
*  For example, preparation.
*  Where he sort of fills the hall with students and he gets up almost as a TED Talk speaker.
*  He walks around with pointers.
*  He walks around with that kind of confidence.
*  And he knows that here are 16, 17, 18 year olds potential voters in the future.
*  But even for their families, he is a man who tells them, hear it from me.
*  As someone like you who has made it big, here are some of the things that worked for me.
*  So he's basically connecting with the Indian people, kind of somewhere between like Oprah
*  and Dr. Phil on American television.
*  Basically, basically that actually might be a better reference than FDR in a way.
*  Just the range of things that he addresses and the tone in which he does.
*  And sort of this hope of mobility, this hope of making it right.
*  He personifies that as well.
*  And there's something hugely powerful about that.
*  And he's very consistent in it as well.
*  Since he rose to national power 10 years ago, he's barely missed an episode.
*  Wow.
*  So every month he is in the years of this huge country, right?
*  And wherever the information space moves, he wants to be there.
*  Whether it's the billboards, whether it's the radio, whether it's the television,
*  and especially social media.
*  Right.
*  This is something that he understood much earlier than other Indian leaders.
*  The value of social media for us, a country this huge to get your message,
*  particularly a country that is very rapidly digitizing.
*  Right.
*  And a country that's so young.
*  Exactly.
*  A country that is so young, a country that's so huge.
*  And the country that has access to cheap smartphones, cheap data.
*  So he understood this very well.
*  And in the past few years, he senses that some of the people, some of his potential
*  voters might actually be shifting to these independent spaces of information.
*  The YouTube show people, the Instagram influencers and all.
*  And he wanted to be there.
*  He wanted to make sure all of them project him and his image the same way.
*  So what did he do?
*  Just a couple of months before the election, he held this huge award
*  ceremony for the influencers.
*  Ladies and gentlemen, join your hands together for the influencer of the
*  influencers, the OG, the GOAT, honorable PM Narendra Modi.
*  For two hours, he was standing on stage.
*  And the best storyteller award goes to Ketika Govindasamy.
*  And he was handing out award after award to hundreds of influencers from across India.
*  And the next category is disruptor of the year award.
*  While the hall filled with people who have millions of followers across these
*  different platforms, all of them had their phones out recording Modi on stage.
*  Giving him a pat on the back, dropping a little detail, having something relatable
*  with each one of these young folks who came on stage to receive the award from him.
*  Yoga, meditation.
*  You know, so it's just somebody who is so sharp to latch on to every opportunity to
*  connect with a pocket of audience.
*  And that was on display.
*  Just imagine the power of those hundreds of influencers with millions of followers
*  across these platforms, walking out of that hall, thinking one of the most powerful men
*  in the world not only had time for us, but he made us feel that he knew us.
*  Right.
*  And what they will do to then carry his message.
*  And this is what a successful politician is.
*  Right.
*  They connect with voters and they find people that can spread their message.
*  But a successful politician is also someone who gives people a story about what their
*  country is and who they are in it.
*  They help people understand themselves as citizens.
*  So what is Modi actually telling them?
*  What is that story?
*  Well, it's a story of India's rise.
*  Think of a country coming out of, you know, a long history of colonial oppression, a
*  foreign invasion.
*  He is telling the same people that we finally found our footing, that we're being
*  respected on the world stage, that our economy is growing, that the prestige of what it is
*  to be Indian now is changing on the world stage, that for the longest time the world
*  treated us as this poor country where you had to send aid.
*  Now the world is treating us as a major power that can offer solutions.
*  And again, the way he communicates this is very important.
*  One of the things he did recently was to have Bill Gates over.
*  Bill Gates as in Bill Gates.
*  Bill as in Bill Gates, as in for all, you know, intensive purposes in the Indian mind,
*  the man who invented computers, right?
*  And Modi's government actually released a full, you know, very heavily produced video to
*  promote that visit and that conversation between Modi and Gates.
*  Morning. Great to see you.
*  Welcome.
*  You know, these beautiful sort of video shots of drone footage and music and all of
*  this shakes hands with Modi and they sit down for a conversation.
*  But the body language in this conversation is very important.
*  I'm just curious in terms of your journey of using PCs or phones or different types of
*  software, was there something that really drew you in or what's that been like?
*  Bill Gates is asking a lot of the questions he's asking in English.
*  Modi's answering in Hindi.
*  And Modi is giving him the solutions, right?
*  On technology, on sort of how do you spread technology to the villages?
*  How do you sort of inject technology into simplifying governance?
*  And what this is telling his audience is that I have brought India to a stage where the
*  man who's associated with computers is coming to me for answers.
*  Right, right. I'm the guy giving that computer inventor the answers.
*  Exactly, exactly.
*  And again, that's a powerful thing.
*  Right. That if you were a village boy, you know, a teenager somewhere deep in rural India
*  and you watch this man in a suit asking the questions and you watch the man who speaks
*  your language giving him the answers and explaining to him how the world should work
*  and what the solutions are to the AI problems of the world, what the solutions are to, you
*  know, incorporating technology in agriculture.
*  He is reinforcing the same narrative that I have made it for.
*  I am clinging on to the identity that is very Indian and look, the world is coming
*  for answers. That my country truly is on the top of the world.
*  My country is on the top of the world, but my country is on the top of the world on its
*  own terms, in terms of holding on to a cultural identity as well.
*  That my country can advance and sort of progress without necessarily letting go of its
*  cultural values. And it could offer the world solutions in terms of technology and
*  modernity.
*  So Modi's very skillfully leveraging this gates to visit, right?
*  He's using it to drive home his central message, which is India's on top of the world.
*  I'm on top of India and even the inventor of the personal computer is coming to me for
*  technology advice.
*  So that's the story he's telling.
*  Yes, but on the ground, it's a much more mixed reality.
*  Yes, India's economy is growing, but it's an economy that is not helping lift up a lot
*  of people, that it's a deeply unequal economic reality in this country.
*  You've got the fastest growing economy in the world.
*  It's become the fifth largest economy in the world.
*  And yet unemployment is a major problem.
*  It can generate enough jobs for its huge youth population.
*  And 800 million people are dependent on government ration handouts every month.
*  But Modi, in his sort of control of the information space and in his political cunning,
*  he defines these handouts and rations as development that looked you are getting help
*  from the government. You're not starving.
*  That looked you might not get a job, but you know, you got a gas cylinder.
*  Your mom got a gas cylinder.
*  A gas cylinder like a propane tank for cooking?
*  Yes. And the political genius of it is in how he then follows up.
*  He's created this huge welfare state where he uses resources from a top heavy economy
*  to give handouts to the poor.
*  And then after those handouts have been given, he's got a huge party apparatus that knocks
*  on each door and says, remember that monthly ration of rice and dal and cooking oil that you
*  got that came from Modi.
*  And in a lot of these places, his picture is on it.
*  His picture is on this sort of government stores that gives the handouts.
*  Interesting. Like the picture of his face.
*  Yeah, the picture of his face.
*  His picture was on the vaccine certificate that every person in this country got.
*  He does not miss an opportunity to be in the face of every citizen of this country, to
*  tell them whatever solution you're getting is for my end.
*  Interesting. So he's essentially giving people these essential things, but he's taking pains
*  to make sure that people really down to the household level understand that he's the one
*  giving them. His face is there like he's really branding it as his own accomplishment.
*  Yes. And I think one part of it is his mastery of narrative building and communication.
*  But the other part of it is the economic context of this country that for the longest time,
*  these sections of society that we talk about, what he's giving them is more than what they
*  had before him. Yeah, they were always so weak and so poor.
*  And the state was failing them for so long that even a small ration handout a month is
*  a sign of an improved state, is a sign of a changed India.
*  And he drives that point home by the narrative he builds around it that, hey, I've given
*  you a little bit. Imagine how much more I can give you if India keeps rising.
*  So it sounds like Modi has really found this very unique recipe to speak to this incredibly
*  vast country. He's organized with his party machine and his face on aid, but he's also
*  deeply appealing and present in almost every Indian's life.
*  And that's kind of the textbook definition of a skilled politician.
*  Yes, that's one version of Modi.
*  But there's also another Modi, a more divisive, even dangerous Modi.
*  And we've seen that side of him come out in recent weeks.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Mujib, tell us what happened over the past couple of weeks.
*  What changed over the past couple of weeks in this election campaign is all of a sudden
*  Modi's rhetoric directly started targeting Muslims.
*  All his life, he spent as a foot soldier of a right-wing Hindu organization called the
*  RSS. And the goal of that organization has always been to turn India into a Hindu state.
*  The secular republic that India was created as in 1947 after the British left, they see
*  that as unfair. So Mr. Modi comes from that kind of a background.
*  And so in his 10 years in office, as Mr. Modi firmed up this vision of a Hindu first state,
*  many of his policies were seen as discriminatory towards Muslims, India's 200 million
*  Muslim minority population.
*  Beyond the basics of welfare, the state's sort of allowing Muslims participation in the
*  political space, in the cultural space, has shrunk completely during his time.
*  And Modi himself in those years would continue targeting of the Muslims, but in a very subtle
*  way. He would make references to their clothes.
*  He would make references to their choice of food.
*  He had all these ways of referring to Muslims.
*  But then he did two things.
*  One is he mentioned the Muslims by name.
*  And then second thing he did was to define the Muslims as outsiders, as infiltrators
*  who don't belong here, who've intruded into his vision of the Indian society.
*  He started saying that if his opposition comes to power,
*  they will take the wealth of the Hindus and they will give it to the Muslims.
*  And he didn't just say wealth, land, property.
*  He said they would take the women's jewelry.
*  They would take the necklace that Hindu women wear as a sign of their marriage.
*  So he went very specific to something that is very associated with honor and not just
*  wealth. And then as he repeated the point, the way these sort of, you know, populist
*  politicians do, he threw a question to his audience.
*  A huge crowd at the campaign rally.
*  And he said, do you want your wealth to go to the infiltrators?
*  So he's kind of saying the quiet part out loud here, right, that Muslims are not
*  actually part of this big national project, even though they are, as you say, 15% of the
*  population of India. They are Indian citizens.
*  So it seems like a pretty big deal that Modi himself would say this, right?
*  I mean, why did he say this, do you think?
*  We were all left wondering why would he veer from a formula that worked for him, that
*  others would do the dirty work of directly targeting Muslims, where he would just make
*  subtle references. And that was good enough, particularly in a moment where he projects
*  himself as a global statesman, as somebody who believes in these democratic values.
*  But I think the place where he made this comment give us clues.
*  It was in the state of Rajasthan in sort of northern India, this northern, more populated
*  belt of India that is his stronghold.
*  And within that state, there was talks that some of the Hindu castes were not happy with
*  him, that there was discontent.
*  And as a way of uniting the Hindu divisions within his support base, he has always united
*  them against someone, against something.
*  And that someone and something has consistently been the Muslims.
*  So despite his popularity, he's anxious about the margin of his victory and kind of
*  resorted to this nasty form of nationalism to bring out his Hindu base, to kind of bring
*  together those divisions.
*  Yes, and it has worked for him in the past.
*  This sort of Hindu-Muslim division, this fear of the Muslim has helped him overcome his
*  other moments of political weakness.
*  But Mujeeb, just to play devil's advocate for a second here, I mean, isn't it possible
*  that these things are all signs that he's actually feeling very secure?
*  You know, that he's not just resorting to this to bring out his base, but that he's
*  feeling so secure that he's able to just kind of wear this ethno-nationalism on his
*  sleeve and do these very illiberal things because, you know, he's so powerful and
*  popular that it doesn't matter?
*  That's one possibility, absolutely.
*  That this is the peak of unchecked power, that I can govern this country and I can use
*  the levers of power in any way I want, the institutions, and I can say whatever I want,
*  that there will be no checks on it domestically.
*  And we're seeing this.
*  He's resorting to crackdowns on the opposition.
*  He's resorting to throwing opposition leaders in jail.
*  He is resorting to drying up the source of funding for his political opponents to kind
*  of tilt the playing field in his favor.
*  And there's also the security that internationally, beyond the borders of India, nobody will say
*  anything at all because he's created the sense of his story, his power is so intertwined with
*  the story and the power of this rising India.
*  And for these outside countries who want deals with India, who want trade with India, who
*  want transactions with India, he is confident that they will not criticize him, that they will
*  not stand up and say, you're crossing lines.
*  Right. So, Mujeeb, we've been talking about Modi as a leader with just this wild popularity, in
*  part because his vision of a shining modern India appeals to a lot of people.
*  But there's also this darker streak, this Hindu fundamentalism that we've been talking about.
*  And I guess the kind of amazing and confounding thing about India and about Modi is that all of
*  these things are true.
*  So if you had to come up with a category for Modi, what would you say?
*  I guess the fascinating thing about him is that he's not easy to label.
*  One thing I've learned in my years of reporting here is that he's many things at once.
*  He sees himself as someone who, after the founding fathers of India, right, after the founding
*  fathers of this republic, he speaks of an ambition that no prime minister before him would speak of
*  in the way of completely reshaping this country for the future.
*  But at the same time, he is someone who has demonstrated that he is amassing power around
*  himself, that he is consistently brushing aside any checks on his power.
*  That he has an ideology that does not see this country's entire population as equal.
*  That that ideology has a vision of a first class citizen and a second class citizen.
*  And which one of these many Modi's we see in the future, it's hard to tell.
*  But in moments of tension and in moments when he is anxious, that darker side comes out more
*  clearly. And the efforts at a visionary statesman that wants to pull up the entirety of this
*  country to that sort of higher place that he has in mind ends up taking a backseat.
*  Mujeeb, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Wednesday.
*  Well, hello, everyone.
*  It's just another Wednesday on Capitol Hill.
*  For the second time in less than a year, Republicans in Congress sought to depose their
*  own speaker in the House of Representatives.
*  But this time, the effort failed.
*  The attempt was made by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson easily batted it down.
*  I want to say that I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to the future's
*  misguided effort.
*  That is certainly what it was.
*  Johnson survived because Democrats came to his rescue.
*  The vote to kill Greene's effort was an overwhelming 359 to 43.
*  The Democrats' support allowed Johnson to avoid the messy showdown on the House floor
*  that had led to the historic ouster of former speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall.
*  Greene had threatened to make the move for weeks since Johnson pushed through a long
*  stalled $95 billion foreign aid package to Ukraine and Israel.
*  In the end, her effort was largely symbolic.
*  Greene was widely booed by lawmakers as she called up the resolution and read it
*  aloud. And they go into Rafa.
*  I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafa, to
*  deal with the cities, to deal with that problem.
*  A day after the White House acknowledged that it had halted the shipment of 3,500
*  bombs to Israel last week out of concern that they might be used on Jerusalem's planned
*  assault on Rafa in southern Gaza, President Biden told CNN in an interview that he
*  would also block the delivery of weapons and artillery shells that could be fired into
*  densely populated areas of Rafa.
*  Biden also acknowledged that American bombs had been used to kill Palestinian
*  civilians. Biden's remarks underscored the growing rift between the U.S.
*  and Israel over its war in Gaza.
*  But it's it's just wrong.
*  We're not going to we're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.
