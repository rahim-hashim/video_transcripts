# Our Film Critic on Why Heâ€™s Done With the Movies
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 23, 2023](https://rr2---sn-ab5sznzl.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?expire=1711161821&ei=fe39ZbyUB829_9EPtd-DwAQ&ip=128.59.177.129&id=o-ALv-U2L_kxYZVtsEARFEOBqVHe3WcKpPdXQIoU-kzNaO&itag=139&source=youtube&requiressl=yes&xpc=EgVo2aDSNQ%3D%3D&mh=Hz&mm=31%2C26&mn=sn-ab5sznzl%2Csn-p5qddn7r&ms=au%2Conr&mv=m&mvi=2&pl=16&initcwndbps=1478750&vprv=1&mime=audio%2Fmp4&gir=yes&clen=15077484&dur=2472.281&lmt=1679565470928588&mt=1711139817&fvip=1&keepalive=yes&c=ANDROID_EMBEDDED_PLAYER&txp=6218224&sparams=expire%2Cei%2Cip%2Cid%2Citag%2Csource%2Crequiressl%2Cxpc%2Cvprv%2Cmime%2Cgir%2Cclen%2Cdur%2Clmt&sig=AJfQdSswRAIgCViEBk1n-j94WSw3ZvN9XN_9QH9ru3WBCHa5-4pw95UCIGgvEar8uXkg0ijreLi3_GJZ-NWiFVj75FMl6bdX6K8s&lsparams=mh%2Cmm%2Cmn%2Cms%2Cmv%2Cmvi%2Cpl%2Cinitcwndbps&lsig=ALClDIEwRQIgZdXLYa4BDSJBPD_60qx-yoYHUIBaOFg324ZBg8NP7MICIQCEYuouPime-R9eDqC6PDkVrm2KOIRSbfknGP38YOKw2A%3D%3D)
*  Hey Tony.
*  I hope you're not too cold.
*  No, not at all.
*  How are you?
*  I'm good.
*  I'm good.
*  I just addressed you as Tony, but most people will know you as Aos Scott Chief Film Critic
*  at the New York Times.
*  Yes.
*  And can you describe where we are and what we're doing here?
*  Yeah.
*  So we're at Madison Avenue outside of the building that currently houses the Sony
*  screening room.
*  The Sony screening room used to be about exactly 30 blocks north at Madison in 55th.
*  And I probably saw 7 or 800 movies there.
*  Today, we have a very special circumstance.
*  We're about to see the movie 65 starring Adam Driver in space.
*  In space or coming from space?
*  I don't know.
*  I try not to know too much.
*  I try to keep an open mind.
*  I haven't watched the trailers.
*  I think there's some dinosaurs.
*  You just said that you've seen over like 7,800 of these screenings.
*  Oh, that was just in that one room.
*  It just in that one room.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I've probably seen, you know, more like five or six thousand movies in screening
*  rooms over the years.
*  And this is a momentous occasion because...
*  Well, this is sort of the end of the line.
*  I have this one now.
*  I have one this evening and that's it.
*  Well, it had better be a good movie, given that it's your penultimate one.
*  Yes, it is.
*  But good or bad, it's a job and it's a job I'm certainly happy to do.
*  And why are you leaving the profession?
*  Well, that's a long story.
*  From what times, I'm Michael Mabarro.
*  This is the Daily.
*  Today, A.O. Scott on why after 23 years as a film critic at the times, he's now done
*  with the movies.
*  And what his decision reveals about the new realities of American cinema.
*  This is March 23rd.
*  Hi.
*  Hi.
*  I'm Michael.
*  Tony.
*  Tony.
*  No, I've never met him before.
*  It's funny.
*  You know, you can go a long time without, you know, at this building without meeting somebody.
*  15 years as it happens.
*  Yeah.
*  Welcome.
*  Thank you.
*  Very nice to be here.
*  You are now the second New York Times critic that we have had, come into the studio, to
*  talk about basically a mid-career crisis of confidence and less than three months.
*  The first, of course, was our restaurant critic, P. Wells.
*  So I suppose we have distinguished ourselves in the realm of occupational therapy.
*  And the New York Times is just a place that burns out its critics.
*  Right.
*  So in reality, this all started a few weeks ago with a job announcement that came over
*  the transome within the New York Times company email system that you, A.O. Scott, A.K.
*  Tony, long time co-chief film critic are leaving this job to do something else, book criticism
*  and writing as it happens.
*  And when my colleagues here at the Daily Saw that announcement, we decided to reach out
*  to you to talk about this decision because after all, who gives up the job of being chief
*  film critic?
*  And we're not just advocating the papacy of culture.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  That makes me the Benedict XVI.
*  It makes you.
*  And it just happens.
*  No one advocates the papacy, except for like a couple of years ago, for the first time
*  in 400 years.
*  And when we talk to you about this, off-mic, the story that you told us about why you're
*  leaving this job.
*  That's the story that we want to talk to you about today because it's a big and complicated
*  and nuanced journey that a lot of ways isn't just about you.
*  It's about the state of American cinema.
*  So can you remember when you started going to the movies?
*  I would say if sort of looking back, there was a decisive moment or period that kind of
*  maybe, although I didn't know it at the time, set me on the path toward film criticism.
*  It was probably, when I was 15 years old, my mother had a work obligation that took
*  her to Paris for a few months.
*  Yeah, nice work.
*  And she took me with her.
*  And it was just the two of us in a little apartment.
*  And she was working all day.
*  And I didn't know anybody and was just sort of a lonely teenager.
*  And so I went and took French classes in the morning and then in the afternoon, I just
*  sort of had the freedom of the city, which was great.
*  And one of the things that I found myself doing was gravitating toward these little independent
*  movie theaters that are kind of scattered across the left bank.
*  They showed a lot of old American movies.
*  Don't try to be a hero.
*  You don't have to be a hero enough for me.
*  And so I went, you know, a few times a week, whenever I was bored, which was a lot, and
*  just sort of wandering in off the street.
*  You never let me have any fun.
*  No fun.
*  You have all the fun in the world.
*  To see a Stanley Kubrick's Lolita.
*  We have fun together, don't we?
*  Whenever you want something, I buy it for you automatically.
*  I take you to concerts, to museums, to movies.
*  I do all the housework.
*  Who does the tidying up?
*  I do.
*  Who does the cooking?
*  I do.
*  You and I, we have lots of fun.
*  Don't we, Lolita?
*  Come here.
*  Or Dr. Strangelo.
*  Oh, I am your war room.
*  You're my thing for it.
*  Tell them that you can't fight in here.
*  This is the war room.
*  It's a war room.
*  It's not as if you were a maniac for raving things.
*  She just goes a little mad sometimes.
*  So all of these things that I didn't really know very much about.
*  I hadn't heard about, especially some of the older classic American movies.
*  The Westerns.
*  It's not only plays, you can shoot too.
*  The film noir.
*  I just want to tell you all how happy I am to be back in the studio, making a picture again.
*  In the way that people dress, the way that people talk to the sort of the sublimated sexuality
*  that you could always feel.
*  You see, this is my life.
*  It always will be.
*  There's nothing else.
*  Just us.
*  In the cameras.
*  And those wonderful people out there in the dark.
*  All right, Mr. Demiel, I'm ready for my close-up.
*  Those are really weird movies.
*  Right.
*  Those take place in a very strange world.
*  And a world that if you didn't kind of grow up in it and grow up on those movies might
*  be very bewildering, but also just fascinated.
*  How did you feel when you'd walk out of these theaters swimming in American cinema and
*  then spilling out into the Paris Street at 15?
*  Well, it felt very, I mean, I felt very aesthetically inflamed.
*  But also the world just looked different.
*  There's something that happens when you see a movie, when you go to a movie and you walk
*  out of the darkness from what is always a twilight world in the movie theater.
*  And you walk out and the world just looks a little bit strange.
*  It looks uncanny.
*  And if you're the kind of kid that I was who tends to daydream and narrate and kind of
*  make up stories in my head, who I did and still do, then you start to feel like your own
*  life is a movie.
*  That the walk home or the ride on the Metro is a cinema.
*  It's part of some film.
*  It is a piece of cinema.
*  And I guess that's when movies really got into my head.
*  I do think that that was the point at which my movie going changed from something casual
*  to something that I was more ardent about.
*  I mean, I started reading movie criticism.
*  There's a way of, in effect, having someone to talk to, to have some kind of conversations
*  that I was often going to movies alone.
*  You needed to talk to someone to talk to someone.
*  So you talked to the critics who weren't talking back to you, but who were writing about
*  those.
*  Right.
*  And who were seeing what I had seen in different ways, which was always very interesting
*  to me to go see a movie that I thought was great and then read it on.
*  Have it unlocked for you.
*  Right.
*  Have it unlocked or have my regard for it challenge.
*  Pauline Cale saying, well, this is the worst movie I've ever seen.
*  I would have to say, oh, OK.
*  But I kind of liked it, Pauline, and having the imaginary argument in my head.
*  And I've always thought that that's what criticism is.
*  And that's what a critic is, not necessarily an expert or an authority, but a companion.
*  So fast forward to this time when film actually becomes your profession.
*  You become a film critic here at the time.
*  And I think 2000, 2000, right?
*  What's the state of American film at that time when you take on that post?
*  I was really walking in at a high point in the film industry.
*  Now 1999 is looked back on as one of the great years up there with 1939 and 1962 and 1974
*  in the canon of magic years of cinema.
*  I think what had happened through the 90s was the flowering of what's sometimes called
*  the indie boom of independent American filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino, Todd Haynes,
*  Lisa Cholidenko, Julie Dash, Cheryl Dunier.
*  There's a long list of names.
*  And I think by the end of the 90s, there was a sense that this formerly adventurous,
*  often politically provocative and socially conscious filmmaking was really maturing
*  and was taking its place in the Hollywood mainstream.
*  So give us some examples from the 90s.
*  For example, so 99, you had David O'Rossel's three kings.
*  Why'd they blow up that milk, sir?
*  Trying to starve to people now.
*  Why?
*  Bush told the people to rise up against the dom.
*  They thought they'd have our support they don't.
*  Really a movie that came to feel very pressing and it's set during the first Gulf War.
*  It's called Meditation, I Middle Eastern Oil.
*  Yeah, on how American global good intentions can go terribly awry.
*  There were odd personal movies that like Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia.
*  Magnolia, a very divisive movie one that I'd like quite a lot.
*  A lot of people didn't like it when the frogs fell out of the sky.
*  I actually burst into tears when the frogs fell out of the sky.
*  The movies were just this extraordinarily varied and interesting landscape.
*  And by the time I started working here in 2000,
*  my mission was to try to connect movies with their audiences,
*  to let readers know about what was out there that might be a kind of movie
*  that they didn't think they were interested in.
*  Because for me, movie going had always been about taking chances.
*  While not saying that everyone should just surrender to random chance,
*  I wanted to make the case to readers that get out of their comfort zone and get out of their comfort zone
*  and see something new and see something that could surprise them.
*  They could show them an aspect of the world or an aspect of movies that they hadn't felt was there before.
*  There's a flip side to that or a negative side to that,
*  which is that you also want to be as a critic, the antidote to hype.
*  Every movie comes on a tide of marketing and publicity and advertising
*  and you want to be the independent alternative to that.
*  So what's an early example of you challenging the time to reader to step out of their comfort zone?
*  I mean, I think that there's my favorite example and the most extreme example
*  is from my earliest years as a critic.
*  When there was a movie called Freddie Got Fingers,
*  I'm going to be a famous animator like Charles Schultz.
*  It's going to be fine.
*  I'm going to be like Charles Schultz.
*  That's my boy.
*  I apologize for the title, but not really.
*  It sucks.
*  The drawings are pretty good, but the characters are lame.
*  Which starred and was directed by the Canadian comedian Tom Green.
*  I wish I was dead.
*  You know, in which he played, I think, an aspiring artist,
*  but basically sort of couch potato loser.
*  Being creative?
*  No, if you'll excuse me, I still have some work to do.
*  It was a very repellent movie, in a way, on purpose.
*  I saw it and I thought it was really interesting.
*  I thought that it was conceptually interesting and I thought it wasn't just
*  gross out humor in a way, but that there was a kind of
*  rigor and inventiveness and ingenuity to some of these comic set pieces.
*  Making the case for Freddie Got Fingers to the readers of New York Times is a bit of a challenge.
*  And I said that I thought it was a work of art.
*  And you know what?
*  I think I have been vindicated.
*  I think that the movie is regarded as something of a work of art,
*  but you're taking a little bit of a chance.
*  Whether or not a reader sees the movie, you're pushing them to the edge of their comfort zone with you.
*  And the challenge for a critic is to be able to challenge your readers,
*  but also retain your credibility.
*  Have them still trust you and at least say, you know, that movie sounds
*  like nothing I ever want to see, but he might have a point.
*  Right.
*  I mean, ultimately what you're describing here is a world where
*  you are chief curator of the options that we, the reading public have, to go see a movie.
*  And what I always felt about reading your reviews was that you gave us a window into your
*  cinematic brain, right?
*  And when does all this start to change for you?
*  Right?
*  I mean, because here we are, we know the end of this movie.
*  You're leaving the job.
*  Right.
*  When do we start to see the changes in this industry and in your relationship to it?
*  Because this is all pretty good stuff.
*  This period we're talking about.
*  Yeah.
*  When do we start to see these changes that bring us to where we are right now?
*  This last hours of your time as critic.
*  I mean, I think that certainly one of the biggest changes that I've witnessed is
*  the rise of or the real kind of world domination of
*  I'm Batman.
*  Franchise movies are what are called off in IP-driven movies.
*  I don't have friends.
*  I got family and putting together a team.
*  The Avengers.
*  Where you have something that is a brand like Marvel.
*  So we call ourselves sort of like a team.
*  Earth's mightiest heroes, I think.
*  Yes.
*  Or DC, or even to some extent, Pixar now.
*  What's like your mission, Locke?
*  We've destroyed deserves ship and Zork himself.
*  Superhero movies.
*  Yeah, Superhero movies.
*  Basically, what is now called the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
*  I'm glad.
*  I don't care.
*  And by the middle and end of the 2000s,
*  it did just seem like we were in this superhero gluck.
*  My name is Optimus Prime.
*  I am Iron Man.
*  I'm Spider-Man.
*  There was Spider-Man in one, two, three.
*  There was the revived Batman movies.
*  Where is Harvey Dent?
*  The X-Men's fantastic four green lantern.
*  Various attempts to do the Hulk.
*  That's my secret cat.
*  I'm always angry.
*  And it just went on and on.
*  And it just seemed to be sucking up a lot of the oxygen
*  in the movie world.
*  But every movie, you say, well,
*  was a blockbuster.
*  Was a blockbuster.
*  But also wasn't necessarily a movie in the way
*  that I had grown up thinking about and writing about movies,
*  which is sort of a singular object in time and space
*  with the beginning and middle and end that you can write about as a whole.
*  Well, you're discussed if we can go that far with this franchise phase of film,
*  especially the Avenger franchise, becomes clear and culminates in this essay you wrote about the
*  Avengers.
*  And I'm just going to read a little bit.
*  Okay.
*  You write this genre, though it is still in a period of commercial ascendancy,
*  has also entered a phase of imaginative decadence.
*  You actually go on to say, you want to fight about it.
*  If you do, I'll meet you at the top of the New York Times and
*  moving with my death ray suit.
*  You go on to say the secret of the Avengers is that it is a snappy little
*  dialogue comedy dressed up as something else.
*  That's something else being a giant ATM for Marvel and its new studio
*  overlords, the Walt Disney Company.
*  So you're really saying this is kind of crap and it's making these companies a lot of money
*  and I disapprove.
*  What was the reaction to that pretty ascetic assessment you had delivered of the Avengers?
*  Well, Mr. Samuel L. Jackson, the Nick Fury and the Avengers
*  an actor who I greatly admire, went on Twitter and tweeted Avengers fans.
*  We need to find A.O. Scott a new job.
*  One, he can actually all caps do.
*  This was my first encounter with a real Twitter swarm because...
*  Well, because you literally poked the bear of an international jug or not in fans.
*  And it's fans.
*  And the fandoms are very sensitive and quite powerful and to some extent intimidating.
*  These movies I think are designed to be critic proof.
*  You create something so enormous and so powerful that seems like such a just a fact of nature.
*  That it just sort of crushes any dissenting voice or point of view and doesn't give you a lot
*  to talk about.
*  I mean, I guess I come back to that.
*  If what criticism is having an argument with or about a movie,
*  the attempt to create argument proof movies that no one will argue about, that no one will argue with,
*  I think that's very troubling to me.
*  And I do feel that there is embedded in the superhero universe, a very strong and visible
*  anti-democratic or authoritarian tendency.
*  That is that what fandom is to me and people will be mad, but I'm going to say it.
*  fandom is about obedience and about conforming and about challenging yourself.
*  It's not stepping out of your cinematic comfort zone.
*  Exactly. It's saying, I like this.
*  And if you don't like this, I'm going to, you know, I'm going to be the happy one.
*  You're a hater.
*  It's not really about having an argument or even about
*  regarding the thing that you are devoted to that you supposedly love as worth arguing about.
*  So it's not just critic proof. It literally undermines the very notion, the very idea,
*  the very point of criticism by design.
*  That's it's and that's its intention. That's that is I think what's the the most sinister aspect
*  of it is that that's the world it imagines.
*  And unfortunately for you, it happens to be the most profitable wing of American cinema.
*  Yeah.
*  And the other consequence of the ascendance of the superhero movie as the main activity of
*  the remaining major studios is it crowds out other movies.
*  So that a lot of the comedies or the literary adaptations or just the adventurous personal films
*  that were so much a part of my movie going and movie reviewing experience have been really squeezed out.
*  It's harder for audiences to find movies worth taking a chance on.
*  And it's harder for me to find those movies to write about.
*  Those occasions where I can say, hey, listen, here's something,
*  here's a movie and not an esoteric out of the way, teeny tiny indie movie.
*  But here's a Hollywood movie that's powerful, that's ambitious, that's surprising,
*  that's doing something new that you should go out and see.
*  And I need to have a certain amount of those to do my job and to enjoy my job and to feel like my job
*  is fulfilling a meaningful.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Tony, at this point you're feeling outmatched by the rise of the superhero films.
*  You can't defeat the Avengers, no matter how muddy the movie's plot is.
*  So what's the next change that complicates your work?
*  The big change and the one that is still rippling out now is the rise of streaming.
*  Oh, hello, I'd like to tell you about Netflix.
*  And the beginning of this change was in 2012 when Netflix, which had been a mail order DVD
*  company, switched over to streaming.
*  And to original programming.
*  And first what they were making was television.
*  There are two types of vice presidents, dormats and matter doors.
*  Which do you think I intend to be?
*  House of cards and oranges, the new black.
*  Right.
*  I'm going to get you, Blendy. What'd you do?
*  Are you not supposed to ask that question?
*  I read that you're not supposed to ask that.
*  You read that?
*  You're studying for prison?
*  They were competing for for Emmys with AMC and HBO and FX and with the whole
*  emerging universe of what was called then Prestige TV.
*  I am not in danger, Skyler.
*  I am the danger.
*  A guy opens his store and gets shot and you think that of me.
*  No, I am the one who knocks.
*  Which had been another threat to the movies in a way.
*  Right. Because who needed to go to the movies when you had, you know,
*  sopranos and bad men?
*  It's your job.
*  I give you money. You give me ideas.
*  You never say thank you.
*  That's what the money is for.
*  So Netflix entered that world in the TV mode.
*  It was making series and it was competing with cable.
*  But...
*  Angel, we are animal lovers.
*  Our plan is to expose Miranda, rescue Pocha and bring her back to you.
*  At a certain point, that began to shift.
*  I would say, you know, when Netflix started investing in movies.
*  Because I'm from what?
*  The papacy, the chair of St. Peter, the Bishop's leg of Rome.
*  I'm going to renounce all of them.
*  And not just in like 12 Christmas movies.
*  12 Netflix original Christmas movies.
*  But, you know, going after and funding work like a Fanzo Quarones Roma.
*  Or no Bambux marriage story.
*  I can't believe I can know you forever!
*  Martin Scorsese is the Irish man.
*  We're brothers, right?
*  That's right. We're some brothers.
*  The brothers?
*  You're brothers.
*  We're brothers.
*  I'm not argue with you.
*  Everybody's a brother.
*  That's right, you're a brother.
*  You're his brother.
*  I'm not what you guys are.
*  So that's why I would like to just...
*  Hey, good brothers.
*  Your brothers.
*  And doing what the studios wouldn't do,
*  which is give filmmakers a lot of money to make the projects that they wanted to make.
*  How is this a challenge for you then?
*  This is wondrous.
*  Right? This seems wondrous.
*  And his, well, I mean, and those movies, I'm very glad.
*  I'm a big fan of all of the three movies.
*  And I think one of the problems is that by taking those movies out of theatrical circulation,
*  or distributing them in a very limited way on theater screens, Netflix has in a way
*  blunted their impact.
*  Because what happens to movies on streaming is that they go into the algorithm.
*  So you can find them.
*  They're there.
*  But they don't have, I think, the same kind of cultural presence
*  that movies used to, or that even traditionally distributed movies still do.
*  Right.
*  And that algorithm is very much tied to personal habit.
*  Yes.
*  To personal habit and to a kind of passivity.
*  Because also you're working on a subscription model.
*  So Netflix doesn't care what you watch on Netflix, as long as you're watching Netflix.
*  So as soon as you're done watching one thing, then the next thing will start.
*  And if you don't pick it, they'll pick it for you.
*  Right.
*  And they're not doing what Aoskot does.
*  They're not picking a film to challenge you.
*  Exactly.
*  And that encourages, I think, a kind of passivity.
*  And also the fact that you know all that stuff is there, that you can get around to it someday,
*  makes you in some ways less likely to watch it.
*  When movies were a little harder to see,
*  it meant something.
*  You know, when a revival or a new print of, you know,
*  Fellini's Knights of Kabiria came to town and you could see it, you know,
*  you had a week to see it in, you would be more likely, I would say, to see it.
*  Then if it's sitting there in your criterion channel subscription,
*  and you can get to it at any time, but you know, tonight, I'm just a little,
*  let's just watch some episodes of the office.
*  And there's nothing wrong with that.
*  It's not like it's not like you always have to be watching, you know,
*  John Deelman peeling potatoes and, you know, sitting at the edge of your seat,
*  forcing yourself through difficult cinema on the way to aesthetic transcendence.
*  You know, that's not everybody's Tuesday night.
*  But the danger is that those experiences get more marginalized, get lost,
*  fall out of people's repertoire of experiences that they seek out.
*  Right.
*  And what you're really describing is another very challenging situation for you,
*  right? Which is, which make this all about me, which is this kind of algorithmic march toward
*  the middle, the quote from the famous Lester bangs of almost menist.
*  And, you know, personally, this is how I can account for the fact that I,
*  I've watched 10 Liam Neeson assassin flicks.
*  I'm embarrassed to say, but they're there and they're comforting.
*  And in this universe, your recommendations, your exposing your brain on the page and challenging me
*  to go see a movie in the theater is, it has a very small chance of working, right?
*  And yeah, and you, you might not need it or, or want it as much.
*  Right. I guess I'm trying to understand if this is truly a crisis for film or a crisis for film
*  critic. It's a very good question.
*  And is it a crisis just for this particular film?
*  Right. I mean, there are lots of movies out there.
*  There are a lot of people writing about movies.
*  There are many of them writing wonderful and insightful things.
*  So I'm not here to proclaim the death of cinema or the death of criticism.
*  But I have found that the way that I've practiced it has gotten harder to do.
*  And also the feeling of disconnection between the critic and the audience feels much stronger.
*  And the Gulf feels much wider.
*  I mean, the whole point of writing for the New York Times about movies is to spread the news.
*  Right. But Tony, couldn't you take another viewpoint of all this, which is perhaps that all
*  these forces you're describing, superhero films, Netflix,
*  on demand, everything, the clap back culture of Twitter, where fans of Samuel
*  Well Jackson, they're the ones who have the last word, is all of this maybe not actually a bad thing.
*  I mean, are they collectively democratizing forces in the film world that are giving people
*  what they want? And is it possibly true that the old Hollywood that you are fond of
*  was a little snobby and a little insular?
*  I would say worse than that. I mean, I would say that Hollywood was notorious for most of its history
*  for being at times actively racist and always exclusionary of people of color, of religious minorities,
*  queer and transgender people. I mean, Hollywood was for a very long time ruled by a production code
*  that mandated a very narrow, very distorted, very conservative view of what the world was like.
*  And it took a very long time to start to emerge from that. And I think it's only started to
*  emerge from that very recently. So we've seen, you know, in the last few years only, maybe in the
*  last decade, an expansion of opportunities for women, women being nominated in Oscar categories
*  that they hadn't been nominated in before, you know, Black and Asian directors and actors finally
*  getting a chance and getting there do. So I certainly don't want to turn back the clock on any of that.
*  But I also think that we should be wary of trusting the corporations that control Hollywood,
*  the control what we see to be democratic and that the interesting work, the ambitious work
*  that has emerged has always happened in spite of that corporate dominance. So I hope that that
*  continues. Right. It's interesting that you are feeling these feelings of what's called them
*  disaffection, disillusionment, because from what I can tell based on some conversations I've been
*  having with our colleagues, their elements of the film industry that are feeling a bit the same way.
*  And they're feeling it, and I'm not saying this to flatter you, in part because you're leaving this
*  job. And here I want to cite the observations of a colleague of ours, Taffy, Brodessa,
*  Ackner, Times Magazine writer, TV writer now, who has been in LA. And she described this phenomenon.
*  She said she had been in LA where she writes, quote, the only question people had for me all week
*  when she was there was what happened to Aos Scott and why he's leaving. And is it a referendum
*  on the movies? And if they could say what was on their faces, Taffy goes on to say, it would be,
*  what is our future? What does this mean? What could they have done better to please Tony Scott?
*  So I mean, assuming there's a little bit of hyperbole in there, so the degree that there's
*  truth in there, is that hurting you? I mean, I've never written for the industry. That's not my
*  primary obligation is to write for the readers of the New York Times and for the audience. I mean,
*  the audience is whose side I'm on in this whole game. But I do think that there are people in,
*  and I've met some of them over the years, although I've always paid for my own dinner whenever I,
*  you know, those are the rules of the New York Times and I respect and abide by them. But there
*  are a lot of people in the movie industry who care about movies in the same way that I care about
*  them who are in it not not for fans or for money, but for some belief in the power of the art form
*  and in its future. So, you know, and I've thought of myself as basically an ally for those people,
*  which isn't to say that I always like their movies or always give them good reviews or always
*  kind to them in print, but just that that we believe in the same thing, that we have some of the same
*  values. So I'm not surprised to hear that reading between the lines of what Tappy said, that
*  they feel some of the same things that I'm feeling, you know, it's not just that they see my leaving
*  as an alarming sign, but as maybe evidence or confirmation of something that they already suspect.
*  And I haven't lost faith in movies. I still love movies. I will still go to movies. But I do,
*  you know, I do worry still and going forward and I worry about my fellow critics and I worry
*  about the state of the art form that we all care so much about.
*  You care about 15-year-old A.O. Scott? Yeah, I mean, I'm still him, you know, I'm still that
*  person and I still feel that same passion and and and order and and amazement and bewilderment,
*  but not, you know, not on a professional basis.
*  Well, Tony, thank you very much for your time. Thank you, Michael. It was a lot of fun.
*  As the movie was wrapping up, I heard you, Chuckle. I mean, yeah, it's just a lot of questions.
*  Yeah, what do you think? Well, I wouldn't say it's a good movie.
*  You know, which is just a kind of adventure action movie. It doesn't need to be
*  particularly profound or original, but it should just sort of take care of its narrative business
*  a little bit better. It's just like all of the beats just seem to happen in this very road way.
*  So here come these dinosaurs and then they're going to kill these dinosaurs. Oh my god,
*  she swallowed a bug. And the berries are poisonous. And the berries are poisonous. And we have 12
*  hours till the meteor strikes and he's mourning his daughter and do something. I mean, the characters
*  have to have personalities, which they didn't. Is this how you kind of imagined
*  acting your career in film criticism? Not with a bang, but a whimper or with the bang of
*  asteroid striking the earth. I mean, in a way, I think it is, to some degree, an anti-climax,
*  but also just thinking about kind of there are always lots of movies and there is kind of the grind
*  of reviewing and is, I think it's fitting in a way because that's been a lot of it. Most
*  movies are quickly forgotten. So it's good to be reminded of that. Not everything we do is for
*  the ages. It's newspaper writing, which means it's, you know, to put it in the old technological
*  terms that will be wrapping fish the next morning. So on earth would care what I think about.
*  Like this movie is clearly, you know, connecting with its audience in a very like powerful,
*  and visceral and exciting way. And that audience is not the middle age guy sitting there taking
*  more in that them.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to nerdy.
*  In a closely watched decision on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point,
*  despite fears that previous interest rate hikes contributed to the collapse of Silicon Valley bank
*  and the larger banking crisis that's still underway.
*  The rate increase reflects the feds need to balance the health of the banking industry with the threat of inflation,
*  which rising interest rates are designed to counter by making it more expensive to borrow money.
*  And...
*  I want to open by stating how deeply sorry I am for the impact this deroman has had on the citizens of East Palestine
*  and the surrounding communities.
*  On Wednesday, the chief executive of the railroad company Norfolk Southern,
*  whose train derailed last month in East Palestine, Ohio, told a Senate committee that the company would provide long term financial support to residents of the town.
*  That support, according to the CEO, Alan Shaw, will include a medical compensation fund to address health risks from the accident,
*  and another program to ensure that homes in East Palestine don't lose their value because of the accident.
*  Norfolk Southern is here for the long haul and we won't be finished until we make this right.
*  Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today. I look forward to your questions.
