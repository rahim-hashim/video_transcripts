*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernice and this is the Daily.
*  Last month, a rebellion inside Russia left lingering questions about what really happened
*  and what it would mean for Vladimir Putin.
*  Today, my colleague Anton Trinovsky on the surprising actions Putin has taken since and what
*  they tell us about how shaken he really was and how vulnerable he might be.
*  It's Thursday, July 6th.
*  So Anton, the last time we spoke a week ago on Sunday, we saw this really remarkable
*  thing happening in Russia.
*  And what it looked like was an armed rebellion by this guy, Yvgeny Priglion, and his Wagner
*  paramilitary force.
*  And coming out of that weekend, we really had two big unanswered questions.
*  One was, what was going to happen to Priglion?
*  And the other, perhaps more important one was, what does all of this mean for Vladimir Putin
*  and for his rule in Russia?
*  But before we get to those questions, let's start first with the event itself because it's
*  been a week and a half and a lot has come out.
*  What do we know now about what happened that we didn't know at the time?
*  Well, remember, Sabrina, what we're talking about is the most dramatic threat to Putin's
*  rule that we've seen at any point, at any moment, since he took power in December of 1999.
*  So a really key moment in modern Russian history.
*  And Priglion, as you recall, is this mercenary leader.
*  He runs an organization called the Wagner Group, which is thousands of mercenary fighters
*  who have been on the ground in Ukraine fighting for Russia.
*  And he, over the last few months, got more and more publicly angry with the official Russian
*  military leadership, claiming they were ineffective and that they were, he claimed, disrespectful
*  of Russian life.
*  And it got to the point late last month when Priglion was actually going after the whole
*  rationale behind the war in Ukraine, claiming that it wasn't true that Ukraine posed a threat
*  to Russia.
*  So that was the background.
*  And then on June 23, he launches this straight up mutiny.
*  And what we now understand happened is he sent two columns of his Wagner forces armed
*  with artillery, with tanks, with anti-aircraft equipment into Russia from Russian-controlled
*  Eastern Ukraine.
*  One of those columns went into the city of Rustov-Andan.
*  That's the city of a million people in southwest Russia where the military command for the Ukraine
*  invasion is based.
*  He went in there with one of those columns, took control of that military base, effectively
*  took control of this city.
*  And then with a separate second column of forces, he went toward Moscow and got to within
*  125 miles of Moscow.
*  Okay, so that kind of helps for me explain something really odd about that weekend, which was,
*  how did that column all the way from the south of Russia get all the way to Moscow over
*  the course of one day?
*  It just didn't make any sense to me.
*  How are they going so fast?
*  Right.
*  I mean, they were still going fast.
*  They still traversed hundreds of miles.
*  But yeah, it looks like there were actually at least two separate columns.
*  And as he was doing this, his forces actually shot down a number of Russian aircraft about
*  a half dozen military helicopters.
*  So now that we're about 10 days out of these events, it's really become clear that this
*  was a bonafide rebellion, very much thought out, planned out by pregozion and his command
*  commanders.
*  And these were troops that were ready to kill and did kill.
*  We're talking on the order of 10 or more Russian crew members that died.
*  Wow.
*  So Russians actually killing Russians.
*  Correct.
*  Okay, so what have we learned about what Putin was doing at the time?
*  So we still don't know for sure.
*  But we have one pretty interesting narrative from Alexander Lukashenko.
*  Welcome, my friends.
*  We're with you.
*  That's the president, authoritarian leader of neighboring Belarus, very much an ally of Putin.
*  He gave a news conference last week where he described his involvement trying to resolve
*  the situation.
*  He talks about getting on the phone with Putin Saturday morning.
*  So remember that's the morning after the rebellion has begun at this point, pregozion's troops
*  are already controlling the city of Rustov and Don and marching toward Moscow.
*  I also understood the same thing as the decision, but it was to fight Putin's offensive.
*  And in Lukashenko's telling at that point Putin has essentially already decided to destroy
*  pregozion's forces.
*  Interesting, because that was also another question I had about that weekend, which was like,
*  did Putin ever give the order to kill them?
*  I mean, that was always kind of a big blank spot in my mind.
*  I was very much.
*  I offered Putin to not rapids.
*  And in Lukashenko's telling, he tells Putin on the phone not so fast, that's a bad idea.
*  Let's talk about it.
*  And then, you know, Lukashenko does this real play by play of his alleged conversation with
*  Putin.
*  Lukashenko claims that he asked Putin to let him speak directly to pregozion.
*  And then Lukashenko claims that Putin told him,
*  it's useless, pregozion doesn't want to talk.
*  At some point, it sounds like Lukashenko has convinced Putin to let him talk to pregozion,
*  but Lukashenko doesn't actually have pregozion's phone number.
*  Putin says, I don't have his phone number either.
*  Oh no.
*  The FSB.
*  The domestic intelligence agency does.
*  So Lukashenko says he gets pregozion's number from the FSB.
*  And he says that pregozion is in euphoric or a manic mood.
*  Hey, Faria.
*  We've got your pole in there.
*  Hey, Faria.
*  There's a lot, a lot of cursing.
*  And it sounds like they really go back and forth.
*  And Lukashenko also tells pregozion essentially that Putin is prepared to kill him and bomb
*  his troops or whack his troops to use Lukashenko's language.
*  Very rough kind of coarse-crued language he's using.
*  Exactly.
*  A very, very colorful conversation.
*  At the end of Saturday night, so about 24 hours into the rebellion, Lukashenko announced
*  that he had reached an agreement allowing pregozion and his Wagner fighters safe passage
*  into Belarus.
*  And pregozion put out an announcement saying he was turning his column around and abhorting
*  that march toward Moscow.
*  OK, so in Lukashenko's telling, he's really just in the center of it all, right?
*  He's multitasking on his phone with Putin, with pregozion.
*  Do we believe him?
*  So Lukashenko was certainly not the most reliable of narrators.
*  Again, this is an authoritarian leader who cracked down viciously against pro-democracy
*  protests in 2020.
*  But it does seem like Lukashenko did play an important role here that he was, to some
*  extent, involved in diffusing this situation and finding a way to stop this rebellion without
*  large-scale bloodshed.
*  Right.
*  OK, so I understand why pregozion would take this deal.
*  I mean, he's basically kind of stuck out there with his columns, right?
*  And why would Putin, who's, of course, famously vengeful, agree to give immunity to someone
*  who's posing a violent threat to his power?
*  Well, first of all, I think Putin has no interest in making pregozion into any more of a
*  hero or any more of a symbol for people who aren't unhappy with various aspects of the
*  war.
*  Remember, pregozion in the lead up to this really turned himself into more and more of
*  a politician, saying things that others are leaving unsaid, whether it's about the problems
*  with the justification for the invasion of Ukraine or simply about Russian soldiers not
*  being provided for enough and the military leadership becoming incompetent.
*  So Putin has no interest in turning pregozion into a martyr or more of a historical figure
*  than he already is.
*  And then there's the matter of Putin's own simple, cold calculation of how to get out of
*  this problem with the least risk and damage possible.
*  So in Lukashenko's telling, he clearly did consider the option of violently putting down
*  this rebellion, right?
*  But if he had gone ahead with orders to destroy pregozion's column, who knows, maybe there
*  would have been Russian military servicemen who refused to carry out those orders.
*  Right.
*  He couldn't rely on everybody being loyal to him.
*  Exactly.
*  Or at least he didn't want to test that question, right, of who would be loyal to him in the
*  situation where he's ordering Russian forces to fire on other Russian forces.
*  And of course, he didn't know how pregozion's troops were going to respond.
*  If they had fired back with the heavy weaponry that was at their disposal, especially if they
*  were near a major city, we would have seen damage and probably bloodshed far beyond anything
*  that's happened on Russian soil since the beginning of the invasion in February 2022.
*  So if Putin was going to violently put down this rebellion, he was looking at a lot of uncontrollable
*  risks.
*  So that option of allowing him to retreat into Belarus, I think was essentially an off-ramp
*  for Putin that he was happy to take.
*  So practicality won the day.
*  Yes.
*  As frankly, it often does with Putin.
*  And Anton, what are the Americans saying?
*  I mean, did they have any inkling that this was a foot?
*  So yes, they did.
*  Our colleagues in Washington have reported that the US did get intelligence before pregozion's
*  rebellion started, that he was planning military action inside Russia against senior Russian
*  defense officials.
*  Now the US didn't go public with that information before the rebellion happened because they were
*  very, very concerned of Putin or the Kremlin accusing America of trying to orchestrate
*  a rebellion inside Russia.
*  Right.
*  They didn't want to be blamed for it.
*  They didn't want to be blamed for it.
*  And in fact, after it began, the US sent messages to Moscow to try to make clear the US
*  didn't have anything to do with this.
*  Bill Burns, the head of the CIA, called his Russian counterpart to say that because clearly
*  the US was so concerned about the potential consequences of instability in a nuclear superpower.
*  Interesting.
*  The US had intelligence about this.
*  And we also understand from the reporting of our New York Times colleagues in Washington
*  so did a senior Russian general, a guy named Sergei Srovikin who for a period last year
*  actually led the Russian invasion forces in Ukraine, then was demoted.
*  And he was someone who was very much seen as a pregozian ally inside the Russian military.
*  So then the rebellion happens and then that night a few hours into the rebellion, we actually
*  see a video of Srovikin sitting in a very strange setting against a white background.
*  And in this almost terrified way he pleads with the Wagner forces to stop their rebellion,
*  to stand down.
*  We are one blood, we are war.
*  I call it a stop.
*  That video, first of all, looked a little bit like a hostage video like Srovikin may have
*  been forced to say those things.
*  And that combined with the fact we haven't heard from him since and our colleagues in
*  Washington have reported that a preliminary finding of American intelligence agencies
*  is that Srovikin may have been arrested by the Russian authorities, really gives us
*  the most reason to consider the possibility that there was some kind of collusion between
*  Srovikin and pregozian.
*  That pregozian may have had support in the high ranks of the Russian military.
*  That's partially speculation and there is still so much here that we don't know, but
*  really it's just becoming more and more clear that this rebellion was a really big deal.
*  Okay, so since then this Russian general Srovikin, who is a pregozian ally and might have
*  even helped him plan the rebellion, basically disappears.
*  No one's heard from him or seen him.
*  Meanwhile, pregozian has got an immunity and fled to Belarus.
*  But what about all the other people who helped pregozian like his troops, people like
*  that?
*  What happens to them?
*  So a good number apparently went to Belarus as well.
*  There's a camp for Wagner fighters coming together in Belarus.
*  At the same time, the Russian authorities have offered Wagner fighters to sign contracts
*  with the Russian military and continue to fight.
*  So I think it's also possible that we will see these folks again in battle, even if they're
*  not officially doing that as part of Wagner.
*  In general, we have seen no evidence of any kind of crackdown on individual fighters in
*  the Wagner force in the aftermath of this.
*  Right, so I wanted to ask you Anton, what does that add up to?
*  I mean, does that mean effectively that all of them troops and commander got away scot-free?
*  It looks like that's the deal that Putin made.
*  You know, he again was just looking for a way out of this with minimal risk, minimal drama,
*  minimal bloodshed.
*  And to do that, he made this really incredible deal that he allowed a force who were responsible
*  for the death of Russian military service members, all of this chaos that we saw on the ground
*  in Russia.
*  He allowed them to get off scot-free.
*  But that left us with questions about how Putin would respond in the weeks after the rebellion.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Anton, what's Putin's response to all of this been?
*  Well, that's a great question, because when we last spoke to some days ago, I figured
*  that Putin was going to do what he often does when bad things happened to him, which is
*  just kind of ignore the thing publicly and pretend that everything is business as usual.
*  But the opposite happened.
*  He really leaned into it.
*  Oвajayev my товарищ.
*  On Tuesday, so that's the third day after the rebellion ended.
*  Putin holds this huge ceremony in the cathedral square of the Kremlin.
*  He lines up all these security forces there, gives a big speech, thanking them for their
*  resolve and courage that they showed in stopping the rebellion.
*  The traffic police was there, the Russian version of the Secret Service was there, the National
*  Guard was there, the military was there, the sovereignty of Russia.
*  So he makes a show of gathering all these security forces around him as if to telegraph
*  to the Russian public and to the world that he's still firmly in power and that the men
*  with guns are still very much behind him.
*  Then later that day, he holds a televised meeting with military officials at which he
*  makes these really stunning assertions about the degree of financial support that Wagner
*  and pregozion were getting from the Russian government.
*  So remember, Wagner was supposedly an independent entity.
*  Putin always said that the Russian government didn't have anything to do with Wagner.
*  And here in the Kremlin, he says, in fact, the Russian government was financing Wagner
*  in full.
*  He says that just in the last year, the Russian government had spent roughly a billion dollars
*  on financing Wagner and that the Russian government had spent another billion dollars on catering
*  and other contracts being provided by pregozion's companies.
*  Which is pretty remarkable since, as you said, Putin didn't even acknowledge the existence
*  of Wagner even a year ago.
*  And we remember that the reason for that is because he gets to have plausible deniability
*  when Wagner does something somewhere in the globe and he doesn't really want to have to
*  claim it.
*  But now he's saying, look, this guy got tons of money from the Russian state and he's
*  just a greedy trader.
*  Exactly.
*  And you know, I think what we saw last week was how shaken Putin was by the rebellion and
*  this real need on Putin's part to show himself to be the real hero.
*  And then on Wednesday, he flies down to Dagestan in southern Russia, has meetings there,
*  conversations about developing domestic tourism.
*  So business is usual.
*  That seems very business is usual.
*  Why does he care about domestic tourism?
*  And I'm only going to get that.
*  Exactly.
*  I thought, okay, now we're definitely back to business as usual.
*  But no, Wednesday night, Putin does yet another incredible thing.
*  He ventures out into a crowd, shakes hands, does a selfie, kisses a girl on the forehead.
*  Whoa.
*  I mean, on its own, it's obviously not every day that the Russian president does this
*  kind of thing.
*  But for Putin in 2023, it's absolutely stunning because up until now, Putin has been
*  keeping up this incredibly rigorous anti-coronavirus regimen.
*  He actually still forces people who meet with him to not just do PCR tests, but to quarantine
*  for days before they get anywhere near him.
*  Famously.
*  Famously, exactly.
*  And so Wednesday night, Putin, by all accounts, makes a major exception for the first time
*  since the pandemic.
*  He ventures out into a crowd.
*  And that was also really a clear sign showing us how much this rebellion had rattled Putin
*  and how important it was for Putin to show the world that he still has this popular legitimacy
*  that the people still love him.
*  Right.
*  Presumably trying to contrast with all of the photos and all of the selfies that were taken
*  in Rostov when Wagner had taken over that city a week and a half before.
*  That was a real challenge in a lot of ways to his power, to his authority.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  He needed to reestablish that authority.
*  He needed to show that he was the real representative of the Russian people.
*  And so you're seeing this uncharacteristically active and potentially even frightened Putin.
*  Did all of those efforts work?
*  What was the effect?
*  Well, that remains to be seen.
*  In a way, this was kind of an unwitting referendum on Putin's leadership.
*  When the rebellion began, we did not exactly see a big spontaneous outpouring of support
*  for the president from the public or from the elites, you know, the sort of well connected
*  and prominent individuals in Moscow who are close to the Kremlin in responsible for keeping
*  him in place and responsible for the whole system working.
*  Exactly.
*  We didn't see them rushing to speak out in his defense either in the first hours of
*  the rebellion.
*  So we saw this passivity that is really at the root of the Russian people's support for
*  Putin.
*  At the same time, in the aftermath, with all that activity that we talked about, we also
*  saw that Putin remains a pretty skilled political animal.
*  He saw his weakness and he rushed to correct it.
*  And it did look by the end of that first week after the rebellion that Putin had
*  managed to stabilize the situation in the short term.
*  But where this leaves us longer term, I think, is still very much an open question.
*  You know, one really interesting conversation I had in the aftermath of all this was with
*  a very well connected newspaper editor in Moscow who told me that he could now imagine
*  the unthinkable of Putin not running again in the presidential election next year.
*  And as one other sign of how fragile the system is, and then finally one other sign of that
*  is the fact that we haven't seen any kind of mass arrests here.
*  We haven't seen a big, big crackdown against people who may have been involved in the rebellion.
*  Putin is clearly trying to avoid doing anything that could risk destabilizing his system any
*  further.
*  Anton, what I'm taking from all of this is that Putin was taking clear and intentional action
*  to save himself and therefore his system because he knows what we all know in authoritarian
*  systems.
*  Power can unravel really quickly because it's all linked to one man.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  And Regorjan has showed Putin's weakness.
*  He has showed that rebellion is possible that Putin can be undermined even militarily.
*  There is this whole patchwork of security forces in Russia.
*  There are all these different groups of people who are heavily armed, who have their own
*  forces, who have their own interests.
*  And that's why when you talk to experts on Russia right now, what you hear about a lot
*  is this idea that Putin is not out of the woods yet.
*  And this kind of thing could repeat itself in the future.
*  And this has reminded us that whatever comes after Putin is not necessarily democracy and
*  pro-Western leadership.
*  Right?
*  I mean, Regorjan is a guy whose Wagner forces were behind terrible war crimes in Syria.
*  He is not a friendly guy when it comes to the West.
*  He is not someone known for having any democratic bonafides.
*  In fact, in many ways, what he says publicly is much more radical than what Putin says.
*  Like one of the things that Regorjan has said is that Russia should be turned into North
*  Korea in order for the war to be won in Ukraine.
*  Right.
*  Not necessarily a guy you want running Russia.
*  Exactly.
*  But you know what would come after Putin.
*  We just don't.
*  And there are, of course, pro-democracy activists like Alexei Navalny, who's in jail, but there
*  are also people like Yvgeny Prigogin.
*  Right.
*  So, in some ways, there's potentially a much more chaotic version of Russia.
*  And that could be even worse.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, to be sure that in a way has been Putin's pitch to the West that he's someone who
*  is keeping those Russian forces at bay.
*  But at the same time, remember Putin is the guy who launched the biggest land war in Europe
*  since 1945.
*  He is not exactly a guarantor of stability.
*  But he is clearly scrambling to get back to that position right now as Russia's guarantor
*  of stability.
*  Anton, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  A federal court in Louisiana has barred certain agencies within the Biden administration, from
*  communicating with social media platforms about broad swathes of content online, a ruling
*  that could curtail efforts to combat misinformation.
*  The case is seen as a flashpoint in the broader effort by conservatives to document what
*  they contend is a conspiracy by Democrats and tech company executives to silence their
*  views.
*  The legal question at the heart of the ruling is whether the federal government violated
*  the First Amendment by unlawfully threatening social media companies to censor speech that
*  President Joe Biden's administration found distasteful.
*  And on Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had finished its incursion into the West
*  Bank city of Janine, ending a 48-hour military operation that was one of the largest and many
*  years against armed militant groups in the occupied West Bank.
*  12 Palestinians were killed during the operation, which included deadly ear strikes, not seen
*  in the area for about two decades.
*  Today's episode was produced by Ricky Niewewetski, Mary Wilson and Stella Tann.
