# Harvey Weinstein Conviction Thrown Out
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrppBA28Ymo)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Katrin Benhold. This is The Daily.
*  When Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was convicted for sex crimes four years ago, it
*  was celebrated as a watershed moment for the MeToo movement. Yesterday, New York's highest
*  appeals court overturned that conviction. My colleague Jodie Cantor on what this ruling
*  means for Weinstein and for the MeToo movement. It's Friday, April 26th. Jodie, you and your
*  reporting partner, Megan Toohey, were the ones who broke the Harvey Weinstein scandal, which
*  really defined the MeToo movement and was at the center of this court case. Explain what just happened.
*  So on Thursday morning, New York's highest court threw out Harvey Weinstein's conviction for sex
*  crimes and ordered a new trial. In 2020, he had been convicted of sexually abusing two women.
*  He was sentenced to 23 years in jail. The prosecution really pushed the boundaries
*  and the conviction was always a little shaky, a little controversial, but it was a landmark
*  sentence in part because Harvey Weinstein is a foundational figure in the MeToo movement.
*  Now that all goes back to zero. He's not a free man. He was also convicted in Los Angeles,
*  but the New York conviction has been wiped away and prosecutors have the really difficult decision
*  of whether to leave things be or start again from scratch.
*  And I know we spent a lot of time covering this case on this show with you in fact,
*  but just remind us why the prosecution's case was seen to be fragile even then.
*  The controversy of this case was always about which women would be allowed to take the witness
*  stand. So think of it this way. If you took all of the women who have horrifying stories about Harvey
*  Weinstein, they could fill a whole courtroom of their own. Nearly a hundred women have come
*  forward with stories about his predation. However, the number of those women who were candidates to
*  serve at the center of a New York criminal trial was very small. A lot of these stories are about
*  sexual harassment, which is a civil offense, but it cannot send you to prison. It's not a crime.
*  Some of these stories took place outside of New York City. Others took place a long time ago,
*  which meant that they were outside of the statute of limitations or they were afraid to come forward.
*  So at the end of the day, the case the prosecutors brought was only about two women.
*  Two out of a hundred.
*  Yes. And both of those women's stories were pretty complicated. They had disturbing stories
*  of being victimized by Weinstein, but what they also openly admitted is that they had
*  had consensual sex with Weinstein as well. And the conventional prosecutorial wisdom
*  is that it's too messy for a jury, that they'll see it as too gray, too blurry,
*  and will hesitate to convict. So prosecutors working under enormous public pressure and attention
*  figured out what they thought was a way to bolster their case, which is that they brought in more
*  witnesses. Remember that part of the power of the Harvey Weinstein story is about patterns.
*  It's about hearing one woman tell virtually the same story as the next woman. It becomes this kind
*  of echoing pattern that is so much more powerful than any one isolated story. So prosecutors tried
*  to recreate that in the courtroom. They did that to searing effect. They brought in these additional
*  witnesses who had really powerful stories, and that was instrumental to Weinstein being convicted.
*  But these were witnesses whose allegations were not actually on trial.
*  Exactly. Prosecutors were taking a risk by including them because there's a bedrock
*  principle of criminal law that when a person is on trial, the evidence should pertain directly
*  to the charges that are being examined. Anything extraneous is not allowed. So prosecutors took
*  this risk, and it seemed to pay off in a big way. When Weinstein was convicted in February of 2020,
*  in February of 2020, it was by a whole chorus of women's voices. What seemed to be happening
*  is that the legal reality had kind of caught up with the logic of the Me Too movement in which
*  these patterns, these groups of women had become so important. And then to heighten things,
*  the same thing basically happened in Los Angeles. Weinstein was tried in a second,
*  separate trial, and he was also convicted, also with that kind of supporting evidence,
*  and sentenced to another 16 years in prison. And on the same strategy based on a chorus of women
*  who all joined forces, basically joining their allegations against him.
*  The rules are different in California, but yes, it was a similar strategy. So Weinstein goes to
*  jail, the world's attention moves on, the story appears to end. But in the background, Weinstein's
*  lawyers were building a strategy to challenge the fairness of these convictions. And they were
*  basically saying this evidence never should have been admitted in the first place. And Megan and I
*  could tell that Harvey Weinstein's lawyers were getting some traction. His first appeal failed,
*  but by watching the proceedings, we could tell that the judges were actually taking the questions
*  pretty seriously. And then Weinstein's lawyers took their last shot. They made their last case
*  at the highest level of the New York courts, and they won. And that panel of judges overturned the
*  conviction. And what exactly do these judges say to explain why they threw out this conviction,
*  given that another court had upheld it? Well, when you read the opinion that came out on
*  Thursday morning, you can feel the judges disagreements kind of rising from the pages.
*  Picture like sort of a half moon of seven judges, four of them female, listening to the lawyers'
*  arguments, wrestling with whether perhaps the most important conviction of the Me Too era
*  was actually fair. And in their discussion, you can feel them torn between on the one hand,
*  the need for accountability, and then on the other hand, the need for fairness.
*  So there was a sort of sense that this is an important moment, and this case represents
*  something perhaps bigger than itself. Absolutely. There was a lot of concern, first of all, for
*  what was going to happen to Weinstein himself, all of that symbolized, but also what sort of
*  message they were sending going forward. So in the actual opinion, the judges divide into,
*  let's call them two teams. The majority are basically behaving like traditionalists.
*  They're saying things like, here's one line, under our system of justice, the accused has a
*  right to be held to account only for the crime charged. They're saying there was just too much
*  other stuff in this trial that wasn't directly relevant, didn't directly serve as evidence
*  for the two central acts that were being prosecuted. So those majority opinion judges
*  simply say that this was a kind of overreach by the prosecutor, that this isn't how the criminal
*  justice system works. Exactly. And then if we call the first team of judges the traditionalists,
*  let's call the dissenters the realists. And they're talking about the way sexual crimes play out in
*  the real world and what's necessary to effectively prosecute them. And they are incredibly critical
*  of the majority. They use words like, I'm looking at the pages now, oblivious, naive,
*  phrases like an unfortunate step backwards, endangering decades of progress,
*  perpetuates outdated notions of sexual violence, allows predators to escape accountability.
*  What they're saying is that these rules of evidence have to be somewhat flexible in the real world
*  because otherwise they're not going to capture what really happened. You can really sense the passion
*  in this argument. You really get the sense that this court is bitterly divided over this question.
*  And what I'm hearing the dissent basically saying is that if we overturn this conviction,
*  we'll be pushing ourselves backwards. This is regress. And that the evidence served a
*  really important function in the trial, that something is lost without it.
*  But in the end, that point of view lost out. In this case, the traditionalist judges prevailed
*  by a single vote.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Jodi, now that this conviction has been overturned, what's next?
*  Well, back in New York, prosecutors have a really tough question to face, which is,
*  do they retry this case? On the one hand, the Weinstein conviction meant so much to so many
*  people that to just drop it seems very unsatisfying. But on the other hand, their
*  attempt failed. Those women are going to be very difficult to deal with. And so they're going to
*  But on the other hand, their attempt failed. Those women are going to be very difficult to
*  get back on the stand. And are they really going to start from zero and do this all over again?
*  Especially given that this conviction has just been overturned.
*  Exactly. But meanwhile, the other thing to keep your eye on is the appeals in the California case.
*  Weinstein's attorney told the Times that next month, they are going to file an appeal in
*  California that will make many of the same arguments that they did in New York. Now,
*  the California rules are a little clearer on what evidence is admissible. So we don't know exactly
*  what's going to happen. But I should add that this attorney is the same one who succeeded
*  in getting Bill Cosby's conviction thrown out.
*  So is there a world in which all the convictions against Weinstein will be overturned?
*  Sure, Katrin, it's very plausible.
*  Wow. Now, given that, what does this ruling mean for other legal cases, for other MeToo cases that
*  are currently moving through the legal system? Well, it's definitely a symbolic blow for the
*  MeToo movement. And also for accountability, which is part of what powers the movement. If you think
*  of progress like a wheel spinning forward, part of what powers the wheel is accountability,
*  because women only want to come forward if they think something may actually happen when they see
*  consequences for some men, it encourages others to step forward.
*  But that doesn't really feel like a symbolic blow. That actually feels like a real setback,
*  because if the promise of accountability was what was driving the MeToo movement and sort of
*  persuading all these women to come forward, then this ruling seems to be undercutting that.
*  Well, it's also a sign of health in the system, because what we're seeing in prosecutions across
*  the country is more testing of this sort. Prosecutors are starting to bring cases that
*  they never would have brought years before. Maybe they're messier, maybe the evidence isn't perfect,
*  maybe they're less traditional. And so to prove those cases, you have to try to get new kinds of
*  evidence in court. And some of those attempts are going to succeed as they did in the Weinstein
*  trial the first time around. And some of those efforts are going to fail, as we see with the
*  overturning of the conviction. But that kind of experimentation, potential expansion is potentially
*  a sign of the health of the system. And the idea that the legal system may be to some degree,
*  catching up with MeToo.
*  So you're saying another way to look at this case is that it sort of represents a legal system
*  trying to navigate this new reality and sort of trying to figure out in real time, how to deal
*  with these kinds of cases. It's almost like a trial and error, you know, one step forward,
*  two steps back dynamic.
*  But also, I want to add that, you know, you can't score MeToo like a basketball game. Every time
*  there is some big outcome in a MeToo case, R. Kelly gets convicted, Governor Cuomo resigns,
*  Bill Cosby gets convicted, Bill Cosby walks free. There can be this temptation to draw
*  huge conclusions from that. You know, it's a victory for MeToo. It's a loss for MeToo.
*  But these cases are not necessarily reliable indicators of what's really happening,
*  what's really changing, because what we're also seeing is real structural change on the legal
*  level. Hmm. Laws protecting women have changed in, I think, 23 states since 2017. The New York
*  Statute of Limitations was extended for rape directly in response to the Weinstein allegations.
*  It's now much longer. And recently, New York State opened a kind of new window for survivors to sue
*  for long ago offenses. So even as these individual cases rise and fall one by one,
*  this system is slowly changing. Hmm. So on the one hand, the Harvey Weinstein case actually
*  changed legislation and created this whole new set of laws around these kinds of cases.
*  But on the other hand, the criminal case against him was ultimately shot down. So I guess my question
*  is, how should we think about the Weinstein case? And does any of this change the way we should see
*  his case as the kind of defining case of the MeToo movement and Weinstein himself as the kind of
*  defining central character? I think the question that Megan and I have had for a long time is
*  whether any criminal conviction in any city is really the best measure of what Harvey Weinstein
*  did or didn't do. Because at its essence, the Harvey Weinstein story is about work. What was
*  really special about him as a producer, his particular genius was for making careers. He made
*  Gwyneth Paltrow. He made Matt Damon, Quentin Tarantino, a lot of producers who are very
*  successful now. That was kind of his superpower. But what we now know is that he also used that
*  superpower to manipulate and hurt women. In story after story about Weinstein, the same motifs come
*  up. A lot of these women were really young. It was their first day, their first week, their first
*  month on the job. They wanted opportunity. They wanted a piece of the action. So though the annals
*  of the Harvey Weinstein story do include these instances of very troubling allegedly criminal
*  behavior like rape, the essence of the story, I think, is about what happens to women in the
*  workplace, the opportunities they have, the way their ambitions can be used against them.
*  And that's not something that any criminal court can capture. You know, when you talk to Weinstein
*  victims, of course you hear the famous things they've said about the kind of physical offenses,
*  the bathroom stories, the hotel room stories. But you also hear them talk about their own careers.
*  They say things like, I lost opportunities because of this, or I could never work in Hollywood again.
*  And they say, my whole life is different because of that. I can never get those years back. And it's
*  just not something that any criminal court is quite built to capture.
*  So in a way you're saying that the story is much bigger than those criminal allegations
*  against Weinstein. In a way they're like kind of the tip of the iceberg. But underneath,
*  there is this whole culture of men abusing their power against women in particular in the workplace.
*  Exactly. And thanks in large part to the Me Too movement, this is behavior that used to be widely
*  tolerated and it's no longer socially acceptable. And Jodie, I wonder, have you spoken to some of
*  the women that you spent years talking to and hearing from who came forward to share their
*  stories about Weinstein and others? Have you spoken to them since this latest news?
*  Yes. And I have to tell you, the Weinstein survivors are pretty resolute. They don't really see this as changing the story.
*  When we first got the news from the court, the first person I called was Ashley Judd,
*  the first actress who came forward about Harvey Weinstein. And what she said to me was that she was
*  disappointed, that this was upsetting, but she was also unwavering. She said to me,
*  we know what really happened. And I guess in some ways, that's the legacy. The truth was aired
*  in a court of law. We never knew what the legal system would do. We never knew whether he would be
*  convicted or not. But the story stands. It's the women who are the narrators of this story now,
*  and that won't be overturned.
*  Jodie, thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. On Thursday, the Supreme Court heard arguments over
*  whether former President Donald Trump should have legal immunity for allegedly interfering
*  with the 2020 presidential election after he lost the race to Joe Biden. Trump's lawyers have argued
*  that his actions, because he was still president at the time, should be shielded from prosecution.
*  Their arguments were unanimously rejected in February by a lower court. But on Thursday,
*  the Supreme Court's conservative majority seemed more receptive to Trump's claims.
*  If the court rules in the former president's favor, it could potentially delay any trial in the matter
*  until after the election. And one other thing you should know before you go today,
*  this weekend, we're going to start sharing with you a brand new show from some of our colleagues.
*  It's hosted by David Marchese and Lulu Garcia Navarro. And the idea of the show, simple and
*  classic. Every week, one of them will interview someone fascinating. Actors, politicians, athletes,
*  writers. They're calling their podcast, Just the Interview. This weekend, their first couple
*  episodes are perfect examples. Lulu speaks with Yair Lapid, the leader of the political opposition
*  in Israel. David speaks with actress Anne Hathaway. We'll be sending you those shows
*  right here on Saturday and Sunday. I hope you'll give them a listen.
*  Today's episode was produced by Nina Feldman, Ricky Nowetzki and Carlos Priero. It was edited
*  by M.J. Davis-Lynn and Liz O'Balin. Contains original music by Dan Powell and Alicia Bay-Itu.
*  And was engineered by Chris Wood. Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landsberg of Wanderley.
*  That's it for the daily. I'm Katrin Benhold. See you Monday.
