# Many Countries Banned Cluster Munitions. The U.S. Is Sending Them to Ukraine Anyway.
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1qUGT-stYs)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  On Friday, the Biden administration quietly announced a major escalation in the kinds
*  of weapons that it was giving to Ukraine, sending a type of bomb so devastating that
*  it's been banned by over 100 countries.
*  Today, my colleague David Sanger tells me the story behind the president's controversial
*  decision on cluster bombs.
*  It's Tuesday, July 11th.
*  David, nice to see you.
*  Great to see you, Sabrina.
*  Where are we catching you this morning?
*  I'm in Vilnius, Lithuania, for the start of the NATO summit.
*  President Biden is arriving here imminently and has two days of meetings with all of the
*  leaders of NATO.
*  Okay, so you're in Vilnius at the NATO summit waiting for Biden to arrive.
*  I'm assuming he'll be facing some questions about what his administration announced last
*  week.
*  News that, honestly, I found pretty astonishing when it broke on Friday, at the very end of
*  which, of course, is usually a sign that they don't want it to get a lot of attention.
*  Explain the Biden administration's announcement.
*  Tell me about it.
*  Well, it got a lot of attention, Sabrina, no matter how they timed it.
*  And the announcement was that the United States is sending cluster bombs to Ukraine.
*  These are weapons that are banned by treaty by more than 100 countries, including many
*  of our closest allies, Britain, France, Germany.
*  And you know, Sabrina, I think this was Joe Biden's biggest moral struggle of his presidency,
*  certainly of the 500 days since the war in Ukraine broke out with the Russian invasion.
*  And exactly because it was such a big moral struggle, many of his advisors tried to put
*  this day off and put it off and put it off again until they hit the point where they
*  had no choice.
*  OK, so, David, I want to talk about that.
*  I want to talk about the Biden decision.
*  But before we do that, let's discuss the weapons themselves.
*  What are they and how did they come to be seen as so beyond the pale by such a large
*  part of the world?
*  Sabrina, a cluster bomb is really a series of bombs all packed together.
*  Think of it as a single bomb that's full of individual hand grenades.
*  These bombs literally have bomblets in them.
*  And as it comes down, instead of landing in a single place, the way a conventional artillery
*  round might, it shoots these bomblets over this area that could be three or four football
*  fields.
*  Huge.
*  Huge area.
*  And then they go off and send essentially shrapnel all over the place.
*  And so a cluster bomb can kill or maim a huge number of people or stop a run of armored
*  personnel carriers or tanks over a wide area of the battlefield in a very short period
*  of time.
*  Like bird shot from a shotgun, except all the individual pellets themselves explode.
*  That's absolutely right.
*  So, David, tell me the history of these weapons.
*  When were they first used?
*  Their history really goes back to World War II.
*  It was the Soviets who first used to airdrop these cluster munitions.
*  At the time, they called them butterfly bombs.
*  But their really big use came during the Vietnam War, when the Pentagon had manufactured thousands
*  and thousands of these and used them in Vietnam, in the secret war in Cambodia, and used them
*  in Laos.
*  And the problem is, for as long as there have been cluster bombs, there have been duds.
*  That is to say, a bomblet that doesn't explode and lands somewhere and just sits there.
*  Then it goes off, maybe years after the conflict is over.
*  The International Committee of the Red Cross has estimated that in Laos alone, there are
*  9 to 27 million unexploded bomblets.
*  And that they killed or maimed 11,000 people.
*  And many of those, of course, were children.
*  Right.
*  These mini grenades can lie around and a kid can pick them up and start playing with them
*  and lose his hands.
*  Or far worse.
*  And that is the tragic thing about cluster bombs, right?
*  That's something that I saw in Lebanon in 2006.
*  The Israelis were using them extensively in that conflict.
*  And I remember being at hospitals and seeing mothers looking at their children who'd lost
*  legs, who'd lost arms, who'd lost eyes by picking these things up thinking that they
*  were toys.
*  That's right.
*  And it's incredibly tragic.
*  But you know what?
*  Militaries kept using them.
*  And they kept using them because they were incredibly effective at what they did.
*  And so they were used not only in Lebanon, where you were, Sabrina, but the US used them
*  in Iraq, used them in Kosovo.
*  And then many other smaller powers began making them themselves.
*  They're not especially difficult to manufacture.
*  So they've been used in small conflicts around the world with increasing frequency.
*  So David, when do Western militaries stop using them?
*  When does a movement to ban them kind of gather force?
*  Well, the movement gathered force after Vietnam, but it really accelerated after the collapse
*  of the Soviet Union when it no longer seemed to make sense even for big powers like the
*  United States to be keeping these because they had been central to the planning in Europe
*  about how you would stop a Soviet invasion of Europe, you know, that you would use these
*  cluster bombs against forces that were coming through the fold a gap in Germany and use
*  them to protect Europe.
*  But once the Cold War seemed to be over, everybody thought no one really needs these anymore.
*  Right.
*  So by 2008, there was a UN organized convention on cluster munitions that countries began
*  to sign.
*  And many of America's closest allies signed it on the first day.
*  Now, among those that held out were the United States, Russia and China.
*  And remind us, David, why the US did not sign.
*  For the same reason, Sabrina, that they didn't sign another treaty back in the 1990s, the
*  much better known Landmine Treaty.
*  That treaty was meant to ban the use of landmines because farmers, children, lots of people
*  step on old landmines.
*  And the United States didn't sign it because the Pentagon concluded that they were vital
*  in one part of the world, the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, where
*  landmines were then and still today are the main defense from having the North Koreans
*  come over and invade the South.
*  So on the cluster bomb, Sabrina, the Pentagon had a very similar argument.
*  They said, hey, we're the policemen of the world.
*  There may be a situation in which you call upon us to defend a nation or some region,
*  and we need the cluster bombs in order to stop an incoming invading army.
*  So what happened over time is that the countries that had signed the Cluster Munitions Convention
*  ended up destroying their stockpiles of these, including most of the NATO countries.
*  But we ended up sitting on this huge stockpile of cluster munitions that the Pentagon knew
*  that it probably wouldn't be allowed to go use except under the most exceptional circumstances.
*  There was something of a compromise for each, Sabrina, which was legislation that did pass
*  that said that the United States cannot export these cluster munitions to any other country
*  until the dud rate, that is, the unexploded bomblets that later get picked up by kids
*  and others.
*  The stuff that's actually so lethal.
*  That's right.
*  Until that rate goes down to 1% or below, and there's no country that has ever met that
*  standard, including the United States.
*  So the cluster bombs stop being used by default then?
*  Like if the US has such strict rules for using them, and many, many countries have signed
*  that ban?
*  Well, they were used episodically in smaller conflicts, but the big use came once the war
*  in Ukraine began in earnest in February of 2022.
*  And from the early days of the war, the Russians began to use cluster munitions.
*  And there was such an uproar in the opening days of the war.
*  There are reports of illegal cluster bombs being used by the Russians.
*  That when Jen Psaki, who was then still President Biden's press secretary, was asked about it.
*  Is there a red line for how much violence will be tolerated against civilians in this
*  manner that's illegal and potentially a war crime?
*  It would be.
*  I don't have any confirmation of that.
*  We have seen the reports.
*  If that were true, it would potentially be a war crime.
*  So certainly we would look to that to be a part of that conversation.
*  She said that, yes, we had heard the reports about this variety of weapons and needed to
*  look at it to see whether or not there were war crimes being committed.
*  War crimes.
*  War crimes.
*  And you know, Psaki used to be the State Department spokeswoman.
*  I've known her for a long time.
*  She knew what she was talking about.
*  This wasn't just a quick off the cuff line.
*  Right.
*  It's a very strong language.
*  It is.
*  Now, let's also remember that the Ukrainians themselves had a small stockpile of them and
*  they too used them in the opening days of the war against the Russians.
*  And they were using them, they argued, on their own territory to prevent the Russians
*  from invading.
*  And they said that's a very different thing than using them in an invasion on someone
*  else's territory.
*  Okay.
*  So the Ukrainians have been using this weapon, so have the Russians.
*  And now the U.S. is planning to pump a whole fresh new supply into this war zone.
*  And I guess my question is, David, why?
*  Like why would the U.S. resort to this?
*  Well, the grim answer to that is that the U.S. feels now that it has no other choice.
*  The Ukrainians have reached a really desperate point where they believe that they need these
*  weapons in ways that we couldn't have imagined 500 days ago.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, David, walk us through the Biden administration's decision to send these weapons to Ukraine.
*  I mean, what's changed that makes them now feel like they really don't have another choice?
*  Well, Sabrina, at the beginning of the war, this issue really didn't come up because there
*  wasn't really a condition under which you would use cluster weapons.
*  At the beginning, the war was mostly in urban areas.
*  But then the war began to move down to the south and the east, where the Russians had
*  dug in these lines after lines of trenches.
*  I mean, this is like right out of World War I, right?
*  And presumably these are areas that cluster munitions could be extremely effective in,
*  right?
*  Like getting Russians out of trenches.
*  That's right.
*  And a cluster munition inside a trench, you can imagine the huge amount of damage it can
*  do killing people who are in the trenches.
*  The second thing that changed was that we discovered that we didn't have anywhere near
*  the number of rounds of ammunition that the Ukrainians needed to keep up a war at this
*  pace.
*  Armata!
*  Here in eastern Ukraine, spring is in the air and so is heavy artillery.
*  Armata!
*  The Ukrainians have been firing off some days five, six, seven thousand artillery rounds.
*  In for context, that's a lot, right?
*  That is a lot.
*  Eleven thousand rounds now roll off this line each month and yet it's not nearly matching
*  what Ukraine's army is using.
*  The United States production levels have gone way down.
*  Ukraine is shooting as many rounds per month as the entire European arms industry makes
*  in a year.
*  As had the rest of Europe's because who thought there'd ever be a land war in Europe again?
*  Already the U.S. has sent from its stockpiles more than $32 billion worth of weapons including
*  more than a million 155 millimeter shells.
*  So the U.S. started hunting around for our own stockpiles of ammunition which are all
*  around the world but then came along the counteroffensive and of course the counteroffensive is going
*  pretty slowly.
*  The Ukrainians are burning through their conventional munitions at this very fast clip and if you
*  just did the hard cold math it was clear that they were going to run out of ammunition.
*  And meanwhile the Pentagon kept making the point that they were sitting on a huge stockpile
*  of cluster munitions that had been built up over many many years and that could solve
*  the supply problem almost overnight.
*  And David what are the Ukrainians saying meanwhile?
*  Well increasingly Sabrina the Ukrainians are saying please give us anything you've got
*  that we can shoot at the Russians.
*  And so in the past couple of weeks you've heard President Zelensky both publicly and
*  privately making his way around Europe in conversations with the United States saying
*  I want these cluster munitions.
*  Now of course the Ukrainians know what cluster munitions are all about they had a small stockpile
*  of their own and they used them and they're aware of the risk to Ukrainian kids.
*  But Zelensky's argument is our only choice at this moment is to win this war and that
*  while there is a risk out here of Ukrainian kids picking up these duds the leftovers that
*  get shot off here we can't really worry about that right now because our bigger fear is
*  we're going to be living under Russian domination and that's really going to make life miserable
*  not only for kids but for the entire population.
*  So the big issue for Zelensky is he just needs anything anything at all that we've got that
*  he can shoot at the Russians because otherwise he loses the war.
*  So how does that affect Biden's calculation?
*  Zelensky's basically begging for this stuff.
*  I think it had a big impact.
*  You know war is full of ugly choices and this was one of the ugliest and basically he had
*  to weigh the risk that Ukrainian kids in the future will be picking these up and that he's
*  adding to the supply on the ground that the Ukrainians and the Russians and others have
*  left versus the risk that Russia will be successful take over Ukraine and perhaps threaten other
*  parts of Europe.
*  So on Friday he actually took the big step in this direction.
*  He signed a waiver that allows the military to send these weapons even though the rate
*  of duds those leftover weapons on the ground is greater than what Congress had mandated.
*  So for him the potential for these weapons to help lift the counteroffensive in the favor
*  of the Ukrainians was worth any trade-offs involving future civilian deaths.
*  Yeah that's right.
*  David I'm mindful that you're of course in Vilnius where the NATO summit is about to
*  begin.
*  What are the allies saying about this?
*  They're not saying much Sabrina.
*  You know they're not comfortable with it but they also know that these are desperate times
*  and so they've been very quiet about it.
*  In fact Sabrina they've been quieter about this decision than many in Biden's own party
*  including some on the progressive side of his party who have been quite critical of
*  the decision.
*  David you talked about how war is full of ugly choices.
*  You know that seems particularly true in this war in Ukraine and the Biden administration
*  has talked about the lines it wouldn't cross over the course of the last year and here
*  we are on the other side of yet another line.
*  What does that tell us about where we are right now?
*  I think the main thing it tells you Sabrina is we're at a pretty desperate point in the
*  war because if Zelensky can't make this counteroffensive work he can't get to the next phase which
*  is a negotiated settlement to the war which is how all wars end sooner or later and that's
*  why he's so desperate that he's willing to go take this risk.
*  Now the Biden administration has come up with all kinds of justifications some of them pretty
*  logical for making a choice they didn't want to make.
*  They say this is just a bridge until we can build up enough of those conventional munitions
*  that can feed their artillery that in other words we don't plan to be giving them these
*  cluster munitions forever.
*  They've said there's a difference between giving them to a country that's trying to
*  defend its own territory that makes the choice to go use them then to use them in an offensive
*  way the way the Russians are.
*  And finally they make the ultimate justification which is the bigger moral problem here would
*  be letting Vladimir Putin win and that in the end was the choice that Joe Biden had
*  to make.
*  This was about a last chance to let the Ukrainians score a battlefield victory.
*  David thank you.
*  Thank you Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  Right now we are in the midst of an extraordinary weather event that has just devastated communities
*  throughout the Hudson Valley.
*  Extreme rainfall caused widespread flooding across western New England and parts of New
*  York State.
*  Water wiped out roads and bridges leaving people stranded in their homes and vehicles.
*  You only need to walk through the streets and see the pain in people's eyes as they
*  describe to me their loss their fear their anxiety.
*  Officials said that about 20 people had been rescued by boat with another two dozen evacuated
*  from their homes.
*  At least one person has died.
*  My friends this is the new normal.
*  Governor Kathy Hockel of New York spoke to the extraordinary nature of the flooding saying
*  that it was made worse by the effects of climate change.
*  Turkey agreed to clear the way for Sweden to join NATO a major victory for the United
*  States and its western allies which had been pressing Turkey a NATO member to let Sweden
*  in.
*  Turkey had blocked Sweden's application for months and what experts said was a bid to
*  extract concessions for itself.
*  The move was a surprise as just hours before Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said
*  that European countries should first advance his country's bid to join the EU before he
*  would back Sweden's request.
*  Finally in a surprising twist the Kremlin revealed that Vladimir Putin held a lengthy
*  meeting with Evgeny Prygushin just five days after he led a rebellion that posed a potential
*  challenge to Putin's regime.
*  The three-hour meeting on June 29th was a startling revelation and it suggested that
*  Putin, for all of his bluster, sees a continued use for Prygushin and his mercenary group
*  Wagner.
