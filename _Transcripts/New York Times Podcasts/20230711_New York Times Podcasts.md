*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverny-Z, and this is the Daily.
*  On Friday, the Biden administration quietly announced a major escalation in the kinds
*  of weapons that it was giving to Ukraine, sending a type of bomb so devastating that it's
*  been banned by over 100 countries.
*  Today, my colleague David Sanger tells me the story behind the president's controversial
*  decision on cluster box.
*  It's Tuesday, July 11th.
*  David, nice to see you.
*  Great to see you, Sabrina.
*  Where are we catching you this morning?
*  I'm in Vilnius, Lithuania, for the start of the NATO summit.
*  President Biden is arriving here imminently and has two days of meetings with all of the
*  leaders of NATO.
*  Okay, so you're in Vilnius at the NATO summit waiting for Biden to arrive.
*  I'm assuming he'll be facing some questions about what his administration announced last
*  week.
*  News that, honestly, I found pretty astonishing when it broke on Friday at the very end of
*  the day, which of course is usually a sign that they don't want it to get a lot of attention.
*  Explain the Biden administration's announcement.
*  Tell me about it.
*  Well, it got a lot of attention, Sabrina, no matter how they timed it.
*  The announcement was that the United States is sending cluster bombs to Ukraine.
*  These are weapons that are banned by treaty by more than 100 countries, including many
*  of our closest allies, Britain, France, Germany.
*  And you know, Sabrina, I think this was Joe Biden's biggest moral struggle of his presidency,
*  certainly of the 500 days since the war in Ukraine broke out with the Russian invasion.
*  And exactly because it was such a big moral struggle, many of his advisors tried to put
*  this day off and put it off and put it off again until they hit the point where they
*  had no choice.
*  Okay.
*  So, David, I want to talk about that.
*  I want to talk about the Biden decision.
*  But before we do that, let's discuss the weapons themselves.
*  What are they?
*  And how did they come to be seen as so beyond the pale by such a large part of the world?
*  Sabrina, a cluster bomb is really a series of bombs all packed together.
*  Think of it as a single bomb that's full of individual hand grenades.
*  These bombs literally have bomblets in them.
*  And as it comes down, instead of landing in a single place the way a conventional artillery
*  round might, it shoots these bomblets over this area that could be three or four football
*  fields.
*  So huge, huge area and then they go off and send essentially shrapnel all over the
*  place.
*  And so a cluster bomb can kill or maim a huge number of people or stop a run of armored
*  personnel carriers or tanks over a wide area of the battlefield in a very short period
*  of time.
*  Like Birdshot from a shotgun, except all the individual pellets themselves explode.
*  That's absolutely right.
*  So David, tell me the history of these weapons.
*  One where they first used.
*  Their history really goes back to World War II.
*  It was the Soviets who first used to air drop these cluster munitions at the time they
*  called them butterfly bombs.
*  But their really big use came during the Vietnam War.
*  When the Pentagon had manufactured thousands and thousands of these and used them in Vietnam
*  in the secret war in Cambodia and used them in Laos.
*  And the problem is for as long as there have been cluster bombs, there have been duds
*  that is to say a bomblet that doesn't explode and lands somewhere and just sits there.
*  Then it goes off maybe years after the conflict is over.
*  The International Committee of the Red Cross has estimated that in Laos alone there are
*  nine to 27 million unexploded bomblets and that they killed or named 11,000 people.
*  And many of those of course were children.
*  Right.
*  These mini grenades can lie around and a kid can pick them up and start playing with them
*  and lose his hands.
*  Or far worse.
*  And that is the tragic thing about cluster bombs.
*  It's something that I saw in Lebanon in 2006.
*  The Israelis were using them extensively in that conflict.
*  And I remember being at hospitals and seeing mothers looking at their children who'd lost
*  legs, who'd lost arms, who'd lost eyes by picking these things up thinking that they
*  were toys.
*  That's right.
*  And it's incredibly tragic.
*  But you know what?
*  Military's kept using them and they kept using them because they were incredibly effective
*  at what they did.
*  And so they were used not only in Lebanon, where you were Sabrina, but the US used them
*  in Iraq, used them in Kosovo.
*  And then many other smaller powers began making them themselves or not, especially difficult
*  to manufacture.
*  So they've been used in small conflicts around the world with increasing frequency.
*  So David, when do Western militaries stop using them?
*  When does a movement to ban them kind of gather force?
*  Well, the movement gathered force after Vietnam, but it really accelerated after the collapse
*  of the Soviet Union.
*  When it no longer seemed to make sense, even for big powers like the United States to
*  be keeping these because they had been central to the planning in Europe about how you would
*  stop a Soviet invasion of Europe.
*  You know, that you would use these cluster bombs against forces that were coming through
*  the Foldagap in Germany and use them to protect Europe.
*  But once the Cold War seemed to be over, everybody thought no one really needs these anymore.
*  Right.
*  So by 2008, there was a UN-organized convention on cluster munitions that countries began
*  to sign, and many of America's closest allies signed it on the first day.
*  Now, among those that held out were the United States, Russia, and China.
*  And remind us, David, why the US did not sign?
*  But the same reason Sabrina, that they didn't sign another treaty back in the 1990s, the
*  much better known landmine treaty.
*  That treaty was meant to ban the use of landmines because farmers, children, lots of people
*  step on old landmines.
*  And the United States didn't sign it because the Pentagon concluded that they were vital
*  in one part of the world, the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, where landmines
*  were then, and still today are in the main defense from having the North Koreans come over
*  and invade the South.
*  So on the cluster bombs, Sabrina, the Pentagon had a very similar argument.
*  They said, hey, we're the policeman of the world.
*  There may be a situation in which you call upon us to defend a nation or some region,
*  and we need the cluster bombs in order to stop an incoming invading army.
*  So what happened over time is that the countries that had signed the cluster munitions convention
*  ended up destroying their stockpiles of these, including most of the NATO countries.
*  But we ended up sitting on this huge stockpile of cluster munitions that the Pentagon knew
*  that it probably wouldn't be allowed to go use except under the most exceptional circumstances.
*  There was something of a compromise for each Sabrina, which was legislation that did pass,
*  that said that the United States cannot export these cluster munitions to any other country
*  until the dud rate, that is, the unexploded bomblets that later get picked up by kids and others.
*  The stuff that's actually so lethal.
*  That's right.
*  Until that rate goes down to 1% or below.
*  There's no country that has ever met that standard, including the United States.
*  The cluster bombs stop being used by default then, like if the US has such strict rules for using them
*  and many, many countries have signed that ban.
*  Well, they were used episodically in smaller conflicts, but the big use came
*  once the war in Ukraine began in earnest in February of 2022.
*  And from the early days of the war, the Russians began to use cluster munitions.
*  And there was such an uproar in the opening days of the war.
*  There are reports of illegal cluster bombs being used by the Russians.
*  That when Jen Socki, who was then still President Biden's press secretary,
*  was asked about it.
*  And is there a red line for how much violence will be tolerated against the billions in this
*  manner that's illegal and potentially a war crime?
*  It is.
*  It would be.
*  I don't have any confirmation of that.
*  We have seen the reports.
*  If that were true, it would potentially be a war crime.
*  So certainly we would look to that to be a part of that conversation.
*  She said that yes, we had heard the reports about this variety of weapons.
*  And these are the look at it to see whether or not there were war crimes being committed.
*  War crimes.
*  War crimes.
*  And you know, Socki used to be the State Department's spokeswoman.
*  I've known her for a long time.
*  She knew what she was talking about.
*  This wasn't just quick off the cuffline.
*  Right.
*  It's a very strong language.
*  It is.
*  Now let's also remember that the Ukrainians themselves had a small stockpile of them.
*  And they too used them in the opening days of the war against the Russians.
*  And they were using them.
*  They argued on their own territory
*  to prevent the Russians from invading.
*  And they said that's a very different thing than using them in an invasion
*  on someone else's territory.
*  Okay.
*  So the Ukrainians have been using this weapon, so of the Russians.
*  And now the US is planning to pump a whole fresh new supply into this war zone.
*  And I guess my question is David,
*  why?
*  Like why would the US resort to this?
*  Well the grim answer to that is that the US feels now that it has no other choice.
*  The Ukrainians have reached a really desperate point
*  where they believe that they need these weapons in ways that we couldn't have imagined
*  500 days ago.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So David, walk us through the Biden administration's decision to send these weapons to Ukraine.
*  I mean, what's changed that makes them now feel like they really don't have another choice?
*  Well, the beginning of the war, this issue really didn't come up because there wasn't really a
*  condition under which you would use cluster weapons. At the beginning, the war was mostly in
*  urban areas. But then the war began to move down to the south and the east, where the Russians had
*  dug in these lines after lines of trenches. I mean, it's like right out of World War I, right?
*  And presumably, these are areas that cluster munitions could be extremely effective, right?
*  Like getting Russians out of trenches. That's right. If you can land a cluster munition inside
*  a trench, you can imagine the huge amount of damage it can do, killing people who are in the trenches.
*  The second thing that changed was that we discovered that we didn't have anywhere near the number
*  of rounds of ammunition that the Ukrainians needed to keep up a war at this pace.
*  Here in eastern Ukraine, spring is in the air, so is heavy artillery.
*  Now, the Ukrainians have been firing off some days five, six, seven thousand artillery rounds.
*  In for context, that's a lot, right? That is a lot. 11,000 rounds now roll off this line each month,
*  and yet it's not nearly matching what Ukraine's army is using.
*  The United States production levels have gone way down.
*  Ukraine is shooting as many rounds per month as the entire European arms industry makes in a year.
*  As had the rest of Europe's, because who thought they'd ever be a land war in Europe again?
*  Already, the US has sent from its stockpiles more than $32 billion worth of weapons,
*  including more than a million 155 millimeter shells. 16.
*  So the US started hunting around for our own stockpiles of ammunition, which are all around the world,
*  but then came along the counteroffensive. And of course, the counteroffensive is going pretty slowly.
*  The Ukrainians are burning through their conventional munitions at this very fast clip.
*  And if you just did the hard-cold math, it was clear that they were going to run out of ammunition.
*  And meanwhile, the Pentagon kept making the point that they were sitting on a huge stockpile of
*  cluster munitions that had been built up over many, many years, and that could solve the supply problem
*  almost overnight.
*  And David, what are the Ukrainians saying, meanwhile?
*  Well, increasingly Sabrina, the Ukrainians are saying, please give us anything you've got
*  that we can shoot at the Russians. And so in the past couple of weeks, you've heard President
*  Zelensky, both publicly and privately, making his way around Europe in conversations with the United
*  States saying, I want these cluster munitions. Now, of course, the Ukrainians know what cluster
*  munitions are all about. They had a small stockpile of their own and they used them.
*  And they were aware of the risk to Ukrainian kids. But Zelensky's argument is,
*  our only choice at this moment is to win this war. And while there is a risk out here of
*  Ukrainian kids picking up these duds, the leftovers that get shot off here, we can't really worry
*  about that right now because our bigger fear is we're going to be living under Russian domination.
*  And that's really going to make life miserable, not only for kids, but for the entire population.
*  So the big issue for Zelensky is he just needs anything, anything at all that we've got
*  that he can shoot at the Russians because otherwise, he loses the war.
*  So how does that affect Biden's calculation? Zelensky's basically begging for this stuff.
*  I think it had a big impact. You know, war is full of ugly choices. And this was one of the
*  ugliest. And basically, he had to weigh the risk that Ukrainian kids in the future will be picking
*  these up and that he's adding to the supply on the ground that the Ukrainians and the Russians and
*  others have left. Versus the risk that Russia will be successful, take over Ukraine, and perhaps
*  threaten other parts of Europe. So on Friday, he actually took the big step in this direction.
*  He signed a waiver that allows the military to send these weapons, even though the rate of
*  duds, those leftover weapons on the ground, is greater than what Congress had mandated.
*  So for him, the potential for these weapons to help lift the counteroffensive in the favor of
*  the Ukrainians was worth any trade-offs involving future civilian deaths. Yeah, that's right.
*  David, I'm mindful that you're, of course, in Vilnius where the NATO summit is about to begin.
*  What are the allies saying about this? They're not saying much, Sabrina.
*  You know, they're not comfortable with it, but they also know that these are desperate times.
*  And so they've been very quiet about it. In fact, Sabrina, they've been quiet or about this
*  decision than many in Biden's own party, including some on the progressive side of his party,
*  who have been quite critical of the decision.
*  David, you talked about how war is full of ugly choices. You know, that seems particularly true
*  in this war in Ukraine. And the Biden administration has talked about the lines. It wouldn't cross
*  over the course of the last year. And here we are on the other side of yet another line.
*  What does that tell us about where we are right now?
*  I think the main thing it tells you, Sabrina, is we're at a pretty desperate point in the war.
*  Because if Zelensky can't make this counteroffensive work, he can't get to the next phase,
*  which is a negotiated settlement to the war, which is how all wars end sooner or later.
*  And that's why he's so desperate that he's willing to go take this risk.
*  Now, the Biden administration has come up with all kinds of justification, some of them pretty
*  logical for making a choice they didn't want to make. They say this is just a bridge until we can
*  build up enough of those conventional munitions that can feed their artillery. That in other words,
*  we don't plan to be giving them these cluster munitions forever. They've said there's a difference
*  between giving them to a country that's trying to defend its own territory, that makes the choice
*  to go use them, then to use them in an offensive way, the way the Russians are.
*  And finally, they make the ultimate justification, which is the bigger moral problem here
*  would be letting Vladimir Putin win. And that in the end was the choice that Joe Biden had to make.
*  This was about a last chance to let the Ukrainians score a battlefield victory.
*  David, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. On Monday, right now we are in the midst of an extraordinary
*  weather event that has just devastated communities throughout the Hudson Valley.
*  Extreme rainfall caused widespread flooding across Western New England and parts of New York state.
*  Water wiped out roads and bridges, leaving people stranded in their homes and vehicles.
*  You only need to walk through the streets and see the pain in people's eyes.
*  As they describe to me, their loss, their fear, their anxiety.
*  Officials said that about 20 people had been rescued by boat with another two dozen evacuated
*  from their homes. At least one person has died.
*  My friends, this is the new normal.
*  Governor Kathy Hocal of New York spoke to the extraordinary nature of the flooding,
*  saying that it was made worse by the effects of climate change.
*  And Turkey agreed to clear the way for Sweden to join NATO, a major victory for the United
*  States and its Western allies, which had been pressing Turkey, a NATO member, to let Sweden in.
*  Turkey had blocked Sweden's application for months, and what experts said was a bid to extract
*  concessions for itself. The move was a surprise, as just hours before, Turkish President
*  Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that European countries should first advance his country's bid to join the EU
*  before he would back Sweden's request. Finally, in a surprising twist, the Kremlin revealed that
*  Vladimir Putin held a lengthy meeting with Yvgeny Prugushin just five days after he let a rebellion
*  that posed a potential challenge to Putin's regime. The three-hour meeting on June 29th
*  was a startling revelation, and it suggested that Putin, for all of his bluster,
*  seize a continued use for Prugushin and his mercenary group, Wagner.
