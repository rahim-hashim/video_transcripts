*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavrini-C, and this is The Daily.
*  A wave of strikes that had paralyzed the auto industry came to an end on Monday.
*  When the last of the three big car manufacturers, General Motors, reached a deal with the
*  union that represents auto workers.
*  Today, my colleague Neil Budet on that historic deal and why it was such a win for workers.
*  It's Tuesday, October 31st.
*  So Neil, we had last had you on the show in September, and at that point, the union that represents
*  auto workers, the UAW, was preparing to strike against the three big car makers, Ford, GM,
*  and Stellantis, formerly Chrysler.
*  Shortly after you previewed that for us, they did in fact go on strike.
*  And today, we're coming back to you because the union appears to have a tentative deal
*  with those companies after weeks of striking and lots of negotiations.
*  Tell me what happened.
*  What exactly have they gotten in this deal?
*  Well, I don't know if the union has ever gotten a pay increase this big in one single contract.
*  It's really in some ways kind of a breathtaking number.
*  So the top UAW wage now is $32 an hour, over 4.5 years that will increase by 25% to more than $40 an hour.
*  With a little overtime, it would be fairly easy for workers to make $100,000 or more.
*  And in a place like Flint, Michigan, a factory town like that, that's a really solid middle class life
*  that these people are now going to be able to live.
*  But really, the bigger moves are for people who are lower down on the pay scale.
*  There are people who are making $22 or $26 an hour, and we're going to have to wait five or six or seven years
*  to get to the top wage.
*  Now they'll move to the top wage in three.
*  So you'll see somebody who was making $20 an hour, and then 4.5 years, their wages will double.
*  So that is a really big move for the people who are lower down.
*  It's not just a benefit for those up at the top.
*  So Neil, what else is in the tentative agreement?
*  One of the biggest things is that the Union won cost of living adjustments to their wages.
*  This is something that they had given up several years ago and had wanted to win back
*  and had been unable to win back in previous negotiations.
*  And so now they have it.
*  So if inflation goes up, their wages will creep up to soften the blow of inflation.
*  Then in addition to that, there's richer contributions to the pension plan and 401K.
*  And they also won the right to strike if the automakers close any plants in the past.
*  They were not allowed to strike overplant closures.
*  Now they are able to do that.
*  So in other words, this gives workers more power to actually have some influence over what factories companies are closing.
*  Absolutely.
*  This is definitely another lever that they can pull to respond to the companies.
*  If the company does something like tries to close a plant and eliminate some of their UAW jobs.
*  So Neil, help me understand what these concessions for workers actually mean.
*  I mean, it sounds like a pretty big win for them, right?
*  Put it into context for me.
*  So the pay increase of 25% is more than all of the combined increases that the union got in wages for over about the last 20 years.
*  Part of the problem was that in the past they had gotten small increases.
*  Inflation went up and they had really seen their actual purchasing power and living standard go down.
*  Now they're gaining back a lot of that and more.
*  So a remarkable win for the workers here.
*  I mean, this is really a moment for labor across the board.
*  We just did a show about the Hollywood writers getting a huge win in their union negotiations.
*  So how did the auto workers get such a huge win?
*  What was the strategy?
*  Well, traditionally they would strike at all plants at one company.
*  They would pick one company known as the target.
*  And they would go on strike there and try to get the best deal they could from that company.
*  And then try to get the other two to agree to the same terms.
*  That was the traditional way.
*  The way it's been done for decades and decades.
*  Basically everybody walking off the job at the same time everywhere.
*  Correct.
*  But this time they had a new president.
*  I want to thank every member who voted, no matter who you voted for.
*  Sean Fain.
*  Today we put the companies on notice.
*  The fighting UAW is back.
*  He was elected last spring and he came in with a completely different approach
*  and a completely different mindset and idea of how to do this.
*  About 13,000 workers at three major auto companies are now on strike for the very first time.
*  And so what they did was they struck at all three companies at the same time.
*  But they only picked a few targeted plants or locations to strike.
*  So here are the two strikes that were announced today, the additional locations.
*  And then they would add more over time to increase the pressure on the companies.
*  The UAW strike expanding once again, more plants shutting down.
*  And what this did was it kept the companies off balance.
*  They weren't sure where the union was going to hit next
*  or where they were going to feel the impact next.
*  So in other words, the new president, Sean Fain, was employing this very new strategy that was
*  kind of like guerrilla style tactics, right?
*  It wasn't everywhere everybody all at once that the companies could kind of prepare for and saw coming.
*  It was suddenly this plan, suddenly that plan.
*  It was keeping the companies guessing about what the workers were going to do.
*  Exactly. And it was frustrating for the companies because they didn't know
*  when or what Sean Fain was going to do next.
*  And it created a high level of anxiety on the company side at the very beginning.
*  They were really frustrated. They didn't know how to respond to it.
*  And it proved very effective for Sean Fain and the United Auto Workers.
*  So the strike starts in September.
*  Is there a moment when the union realizes this new strategy it's got going is working?
*  Yeah, fairly early on, they knew they were gaining ground.
*  And the best example of that came at the beginning of October,
*  Ford and the UAW were going to have a negotiating session.
*  It was at the Ford World Headquarters.
*  They had a big room with this giant negotiating table with 50 seats on one side and 50 seats on
*  the other. They were all set for this big meeting. But the union got there and Ford did not have
*  a new offer for them. And that surprised Sean Fain and he was annoyed.
*  And right then in there he told Ford, you just lost Kentucky truck.
*  And he was referring to this truck plant in Louisville, Kentucky.
*  It's Ford's largest. It's Ford's most profitable.
*  And he walked out minutes after the meeting started and called the local president in Kentucky
*  and told them, tell your workers to walk out of the plant.
*  Thousands of auto workers unexpectedly walked off the job at one of Ford's most.
*  And that night they walked out.
*  This is serious. This Kentucky plant does a lot.
*  This is the plant that builds the Super Duty F series.
*  It also builds the expedition as well as the Lincoln Navigator.
*  High profit vehicles, this one really hurts Ford.
*  And it was a really dramatic moment because it showed the power that Sean Fain had
*  to strike at the company very quickly and at a time and a place the company was unprepared for.
*  They thought they figured out the so-called rules of the game.
*  So we changed the rules.
*  And now there's only one rule.
*  Pony up.
*  And then after the strike at the Kentucky plant, the UAW did the same thing to GM.
*  We're going to hit when we need to hit and where we need to hit.
*  And then to Stellantis they went out and had big truck plants owned by those companies.
*  Time is on our side and our strategy is working.
*  And very quickly about two weeks later,
*  the UAW has reached a deal with Ford, Union President.
*  They had a tentative agreement with Ford and then three days later,
*  Stellantis agreed to basically the same terms as Ford.
*  And then finally on Monday, October 30th,
*  there was a tentative agreement with General Motors,
*  which means the strike is finally after six weeks coming to an end.
*  So in the end, do we have any sense of what this strike
*  costs the auto companies?
*  Yes, it has hit their bottom line.
*  And if you look at GM, for example, just the other day,
*  they said that the strike had cost them $800 million,
*  which is a significant sum, but it's not crippling to the company.
*  See, it's a sum they can manage and get by with.
*  General Motors is on track to make about $10 billion this year.
*  So it really doesn't knock them off course.
*  Okay, so overall this pretty unorthodox approach
*  caused the auto companies some pain enough to make deals with the UAW
*  that are very favorable to workers.
*  And the person at the center of that, as we've been discussing,
*  is Sean Fein, who has this kind of brash confrontational approach.
*  And I remember the last time you were on the show,
*  you were saying there's a real question about whether that's going to work.
*  And it seems like we have the answer to that, right?
*  Yes, Sean Fein has really, through this strike, emerged as
*  one of the most important leaders in the UAW's long history.
*  For the last 20 years, the union has really been going backwards.
*  They've been giving concessions to the companies.
*  They've accepted lower wages for newer workers.
*  And Sean Fein is the man who turned that around.
*  What Sean Fein has done is really impressive.
*  And it's going to have implications for the future,
*  not just for the UAW, but for other unions and even non-unionized workers.
*  And certainly for organized labor in general.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Neil, how should we understand this really big potential win for the UAW?
*  And what it means for the union in the longer term?
*  It really is a very big win for the United Auto Workers.
*  Because it changes the prospects for the union.
*  They now have the potential to gain new members and organize.
*  Because this contract really enhances the union's image and reputation.
*  For years, they had been going backwards.
*  And now they're taking their members forward and winning higher wages and better benefits.
*  So it makes the union more attractive to workers who could potentially join.
*  And what does it mean about what the union's ambitions are at this point?
*  Well, they're looking toward the south.
*  And throughout the south and the lower Midwest, foreign-owned automakers,
*  Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, owned plants that are non-union.
*  And in the past, the UAW has made some attempts to organize these plants.
*  And they've been rebuffed.
*  They tried at a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
*  And the workers rejected the UAW.
*  But now they can come back and show these big gains that they have gotten in this contract.
*  And in many cases, these plants in the south, these non-union plants,
*  pay significantly less than UAW wages.
*  For example, many of these plants are starting wages as in the high teens.
*  And then people can climb up into the mid-20s, $25, $27 an hour.
*  But this new contract takes the top UAW wage up to 40.
*  So there's a really wide gap between what the UAW workers are going to be earning
*  and what these non-union workers in the south are earning.
*  So basically, the UAW is kind of looking around at the landscape,
*  seeing what it just got and thinking maybe it could expand the territory,
*  expand where it actually has members, right?
*  Expanding to other companies that are in fact not unionized.
*  Absolutely.
*  Sean Fain has said that is their ambition is to go on the road and organize.
*  He said, organize like we've never organized before and go to these plants
*  and try to convince these workers to sign up and have them vote in favor of the UAW this time.
*  Now they can go to these plants in the south and say,
*  this is what we won from the big three.
*  And that's what we can win for you from whoever your employer is.
*  Mercedes, BMW, Hyundai, Toyota, Nissan and so on.
*  Now let's turn to the auto companies themselves.
*  And obviously this is a very favorable deal for workers that they just struck.
*  What does this ultimately mean for their business, the big three?
*  Well, it creates more challenges for these companies.
*  It means that their labor costs are going to increase.
*  And they've been preparing for this.
*  About two years ago, they started cutting costs internally
*  in hopes of making enough cuts so that it would cushion the impact of higher labor costs.
*  But it's not like the old days where there were labor contracts that had certain terms
*  that really burdened the Detroit companies that kept them from competing.
*  Labor costs these days is only about 5% of the cost of an automobile.
*  So it's that 5% that is going to increase.
*  But it's such a small portion that it's not going to throw these companies economics
*  completely out of whack.
*  Got it. So Neil, you've been covering the auto industry for 21 years.
*  How would you describe this moment that we're in?
*  And what is this agreement changed?
*  It's really a dramatic point in time.
*  When I came in, the story of Detroit was a story of decline.
*  And those companies were struggling.
*  They were closing plants.
*  They were laying off workers.
*  The UAW itself was in decline and in retreat.
*  And really in the last 10 years, these companies have become rejuvenated.
*  After General Motors and Chrysler came out of bankruptcy and Ford survived the financial crisis.
*  Of 2008?
*  Yes, correct.
*  They have slimmed down and become really competitive and have had a long run of near record or record profits.
*  And at this point, this means the winnings of that hot streak for the companies gets extended to the workers.
*  Now they're really going to see the impact of those profits,
*  trickle to them and improve their lives as well.
*  So the workers really scored a win after many, many years of losses.
*  Yes, it's a dramatic turnaround.
*  Sean Fein said the other day that this union used to be a story of decline and defeat.
*  And now this is a story of victory and moving forward.
*  And do you think Neil that it provides some sort of blueprint for other types of industries?
*  I mean, in terms of his tactics and how they actually pulled this off?
*  I'm not sure the tactics themselves, the targeted strike and hitting certain plants at certain times.
*  I don't know if that's transferable, but just the fact that the UAW has won this big victory
*  should embolden other unions to try to do something similar.
*  And I think you'll even see non-union jobs reacting to this.
*  Just in the auto industry alone, for example, the foreign-owned plants in the south that are
*  non-unionized, you're likely to see them raise their wages kind of preemptively.
*  So as to maybe stave off a UAW attempt to organize their plants, if they give their workers a raise,
*  maybe they won't want to join the UAW.
*  So just that alone is going to have a ripple effect throughout various industries where there are unions
*  and even where there are no unions.
*  So in a way, this seems like a win-win.
*  Like auto workers make a better living, and it doesn't fundamentally change the competitiveness
*  of the American automakers.
*  Well, it's certainly a win for the workers.
*  If you go back to the 60s and 70s, getting a job in an auto plant was a ticket to the middle class.
*  You could get out of high school, take one of these jobs, and be assured of living a very comfortable life.
*  You could raise your family, have some nice vacations, and live a great life and send your kids to
*  college. And we haven't really seen a lot of jobs like that in the last 20 years.
*  And this contract brings that back, brings back that potential.
*  The UAW in the past, I mean, they've taken credit for helping build the middle class in the United
*  States and prosperity in the post-World War II years.
*  And now they have the potential to be that kind of engine again.
*  As Sean Fain says, it helps restore the American dream.
*  Neil, thank you.
*  It was a pleasure. Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  You
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  I hope and pray that civilized nations everywhere will back this fight.
*  Because Israel's fight is your fight.
*  As Israeli troops advance deeper into Gaza, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*  called on world leaders to support his country's war against Hamas and rejected calls for a ceasefire.
*  Describing such a possibility as, quote, a surrender to terrorism.
*  Israel did not start this war.
*  Israel did not want this war.
*  But Israel will win this war.
*  Asked about the growing civilian death toll in Gaza from Israeli air strikes,
*  which has surpassed 8,000 people according to the Hamas' run health ministry,
*  Netanyahu accused Hamas of preventing civilians from leaving the areas of conflict,
*  a claim that Hamas disputes.
*  Meanwhile, in Gaza on Monday, Israeli armored vehicles appeared to be moving toward Gaza City,
*  a Hamas stronghold from three directions.
*  During operations there, Israel said it had rescued one of its soldiers who'd been abducted by Hamas
*  on October 7th and brought to Gaza.
