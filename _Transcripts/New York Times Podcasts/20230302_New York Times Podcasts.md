*  This is Sydney Harper, daily producer. I'm here outside Supreme Court in DC. It's
*  Tuesday morning and I'm looking at a protest a bunch of people who are here in
*  favor of the student loan debt cancellation program.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernicee and this is the daily. This week, the
*  Supreme Court heard arguments in a case against President Biden's student loan
*  cancellation program. That program would wipe out an astonishing 400 billion
*  dollars in student debt. The case seeks to reverse that. Hi y'all. I'm just
*  curious about people's student debt and I'm trying to like hear some numbers
*  from people about what they owe. Some numbers. 25,000. Yeah. I think I have about
*  like 40k. Oh, for student loan debt? Yeah. How much? Yeah. Approximately 130,000
*  dollars in student loans. Your mouth is open right now. That's a lie. That is a lie. What are you
*  owe in months? Oh, 36,000 but I say 35,000 to make myself feel better. It doesn't
*  make you feel better? No. I just crossed six figures this year. So it's
*  extremely worrying that I'm not going to be able to build that generational wealth
*  for my children, my children's children. So that way they don't have to take out
*  loans in college. So I just worry about the future of my family and generations
*  to come if I'm unable to get out of this debt myself. Today, my colleague Adam
*  Liptack on how the court might rule and what that will mean for more than 40
*  million Americans. It's Thursday, March 2nd.
*  So Adam, tell us about the case the Supreme Court heard on Tuesday. The
*  Supreme Court is considering whether President Biden can embark on one of the
*  most ambitious and expensive executive actions ever. It's a big case on a
*  practical level, but it's also a big case on a kind of legal and
*  constitutional structure level asking when the president is authorized to take
*  such a big step and what Congress had to do to give him that authority.
*  Remind us how we got here.
*  Well, this like so much of the life we leave these days has its roots in the
*  pandemic. And when the pandemic started in March of 2020, President Trump and
*  his education secretary Betsy DeVos decided that the pandemic warranted
*  emergency action and that they would pause repayment obligations for everyone
*  who has federal student loans and also interest accrual. And he relies on a
*  2003 law, the higher education relief opportunities for students act, people
*  called the heroes act. Initially passed after the September 11 attacks says
*  this that the education secretary can wave or modify any statutory or
*  regulatory provision to borrowers affected by a war or other military operation
*  or national emergency. And that phrase national emergency does all the work.
*  And it allows President Trump and his education secretary Betsy DeVos to
*  pause loan repayments and interest accrual.
*  Okay, so that's Trump using the financial burden on millions of students.
*  Then Biden comes in. What does he do?
*  Initially, President Biden continues the loan pause. It continues to
*  cost the government lots and lots of money. But there comes a time when he
*  sees that the pandemic is going to end. And back in August, he decides that
*  the repayment pause would end. And that instead, he would forgive a great
*  deal of the debt relying on the heroes act. He would forgive $10,000 for
*  people making $125,000 or less or $20,000 for people who received
*  pelt grants for poor students in college. And this was in the face of some
*  doubt on the scope of his authority on whether he had the power to make this
*  enormous move of forgiving more than $400 billion of debt.
*  Yeah, that kind of action is obviously a step further than what both Trump and
*  Biden have been doing to that point. So what's the response?
*  The response among Democrats and particularly among young Democrats was
*  enormously enthusiastic. And it also engendered a kind of fury on the right
*  who didn't think the president has this power who, you know, called King
*  Biden and who promptly went to court all around the country. But most notably
*  in a case brought by six Republican led states to say the president was not
*  authorized to do this. And that the heroes acted not given the power to forgive
*  all this debt. Right. And all of that leads us to Tuesday
*  with the arguments in this case before the Supreme Court. So what happened in
*  the court? What did the administration say?
*  Well, I should mention that there were actually two cases about the Biden
*  plan before the court. One was brought by two borrowers. But I think that case was minor
*  and not likely to succeed. Then there's the second one, the main one, which was brought
*  by six states. It was mainly on behalf of an agency in Missouri, which they claim was damaged
*  by the Biden plan. And in that second case, again, the basic question was whether the
*  coronavirus pandemic justified under this hero's act of 2003, the wholesale cancellation
*  of hundreds of billions of dollars in student debt.
*  We'll hear argument first this morning in case 2506 Biden versus Nebraska.
*  The Biden administration represented by the solicitor general Elizabeth Brelager
*  makes a couple of basic points. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.
*  COVID-19 is the most devastating pandemic in our nation's history, and it has caused enormous
*  disruption and economic distress. One is to remind the justices of what a devastating economic
*  impact COVID had, particularly on people with student debt. Over the past three years,
*  millions of Americans have struggled to pay rent, utilities, food, and many have been
*  unable to pay their debts. And to say that it would cause a devastating blow to people and
*  cause many of them to default if they were made to repay the sums that the administration wants
*  to forgive. But if that forbearance ends without further relief, it's undisputed that defaults
*  and delinquencies will surge above pre-pandemic levels. And then she went on to make the legal point.
*  Two secretaries across two administrations invoked the Hero's Act to suspend interest
*  and payment obligations for all Americans with federal government. That the Hero's Act, she says,
*  completely and comfortably authorizes the Secretary of Education to waive her modify
*  any statutory regulatory provision which she says encompasses student debt.
*  And how did the justices respond to that argument?
*  Well, the more conservative justices were not at all persuaded.
*  You're arguing here that the President can act unilaterally that there was no role for
*  Congress to play in this either. And Chief Justice Roberts, in particular, right out of the gate,
*  says that if you're going to spend these kinds of sums of money, you need particularly clear
*  congressional authorization and he didn't see it. Now, we take very seriously the idea of
*  separation of powers and that power should be divided to prevent its abuse.
*  He thought that the separation of powers doesn't allow the executive to act on its own.
*  And he invoked a concept that the court calls the major questions doctrine.
*  You would recognize at least that this is a case that presents extraordinarily serious important
*  issues about the role of Congress and about the role that we should exercise in scrutinizing that.
*  It's significant enough that the major questions doctrine ought to be considered
*  implicated. And Adam, what is the major questions doctrine?
*  It's a judicially created doctrine that says the bigger a deal is, the bigger the political
*  stakes are, the bigger the economic stakes are, the more Congress has to speak clearly.
*  That even if you have some statutory language that may authorize you to do something minor,
*  if it's a big enough deal and the Chief Justice says half a trillion dollars is certainly a big
*  enough deal, Congress has to speak exceptionally clearly. Congress has to give really clear authority
*  to the president to do what he wants to do if the question is major.
*  Right. But there is something that the conservators are saying here that's true,
*  which is like there's a lot of money involved here. So it does in a way feel like $400 billion
*  would qualify as major.
*  Right. And even Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal, says, well, on that, you know, she doesn't
*  disagree that the sums of money involved are major. And I think probably the ordinary American,
*  as a matter of common sense, would at least want to know that Congress has blessed this idea.
*  So even if you have consensus that it's a lot of money and most people would say, given the
*  sums of money involved, you want Congress to have blessed it. That just takes you back to the
*  Heroes Act. And in particular, to the question of what does wave or modify mean.
*  General, is this a waiver or is it a modification?
*  It's both a waiver and a modification, Justice Thomas. This appears a couple of the justices,
*  Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas seem pretty clear that they didn't think
*  waiver modify meant cancel. We're talking about half a trillion dollars. How does that fit under
*  the normal understanding of modifying? That that was something different.
*  Well, would you take a minute to explain how a waiver or modification amounts to a waiver?
*  So you see that even on the court, people are struggling with just how far you can take those
*  words from 2003 waiver modify. And how did the Biden administration respond to that skepticism about
*  the language? It said the language plainly covers exactly what happened here. It talks about
*  responding to an emergency. Congress already made the judgment that in the context of a national
*  emergency, you should be able to, she said, Congress anticipated that it would be giving the secretary
*  of education power in an emergency to be nimble and aggressive. So there's not the same mismatch
*  here of taking an old statute and dusting it off and deploying it in a context where Congress could
*  never have imagined it would be used before. Instead, this is a perfect fit with the problem that
*  the secretary confronted. So she seems quite comfortable and confident that the statute gave
*  him the power they invoked. And were the justices convinced by that? That the Biden administration actually
*  had the full power to do it under the statute? The right side of the court, the six justice conservative
*  majority, did not seem persuaded by these arguments. And some of them also talked about not buying it
*  as a matter of fundamental fairness. What I think they argue that is missing is cost to other
*  persons in terms of fairness, for example. So you had justice Neil Gorsuch talking about what about
*  people who've paid off their loans. People who don't have planned their lives around not seeking
*  loans and people who are not eligible for loans in the first place and that a half a trillion
*  dollars is being diverted to one group of favored persons over others. And he said half a trillion
*  dollars are being diverted to one group instead of another. Then I didn't see anything in the
*  memorandum that dealt with those kinds of questions. And if there is something I'd be appreciative
*  if you could point me to it. No, there's not. So at this point, we've really gone beyond the issue
*  of separation of powers. It sounds like really the conservatives are taking issue with the program
*  itself. They're really doubtful about the wisdom and fairness of the program. Chief Justice Roberts
*  proposes a distinction. Says some people take out loans and go to college and they do very well
*  in life. And we're going to forgive those loans. Some people start small businesses. Some people start
*  a lawn care business and take out loans. We're not going to forgive those loans even though
*  those people typically might do less well than people with college degrees. And then he makes a
*  characteristically smart pivot and says, but of course, my views of fairness don't count. Your
*  views of fairness don't count. But where there are questions of fairness in play, that is typically
*  a question for Congress. He says, Congress decides how to spend taxpayers money if there are questions
*  of fairness involved. Maybe Congress should have acted. But the bottom line, Sabrina, is that
*  the conservative justice is we're not buying what the Biden administration was selling.
*  We'll be right back. Adam, what did the state's lawyer argue? I mean, the side that was
*  suing the Biden administration. James Campbell, Nebraska's solicitor general arguing for these
*  six Republican-led states makes a couple of basic points. First, he said whatever the Trump
*  administration did in the heat of the pandemic to pause loan repayment for a relatively brief
*  period of time, maybe fits within the Heroes Act, maybe said to be a modification. I think
*  arguably that was a legitimate use of the Heroes Act because taking a Congressional created six-month
*  program and extending it for three months seems like it might be a modification. But now they're
*  but now with the pandemic receding and the completely different tech, he says that the Biden
*  administration is taking not in pausing, but forgiving entirely, huge sums of money, he says is
*  clearly not authorized by the Heroes Act. But now there were two years down the road,
*  we're beyond the modification and not only that, the connection to the national emergency has become
*  even more tenuous. And how do the liberal justices respond to this argument? I got to say, Sabrina,
*  they seemed a little incredulous. You know, Congress could not have made this much more clear. I mean,
*  Congress didn't say exactly the circumstances in which it wanted the secretary to use this
*  authority. Of course not. This is a bill about like what happens when you have an emergency.
*  Justice Elena Kagan, for instance, says that Congress could hardly have been clearer. Congress said
*  the Secretary could act where there was an emergency. Nobody doubts that this was an emergency.
*  That's what happens when you give people emergency power. And she has a back and forth with Mr. Campbell
*  about a hypothetical. So let me give you an example. Suppose like there's an earthquake. We'll use an
*  earthquake instead of a pandemic. What if it's an earthquake? What if it's an earthquake instead of a
*  pandemic? Can the secretary allow loan forgiveness in that circumstance? Could the secretary say,
*  well, there was this terrible earthquake and lots of people's houses were destroyed. And I'm going
*  to discharge the loans of people whose houses were destroyed in this terrible earthquake.
*  And Campbell says no, that's not a waiver or modification. Your Honor, it sounds to me like
*  creating a new program. I don't think that that would be okay under the Heroes Act now. Kagan
*  responds, but this is very broad language. You can modify your wave any statutory or regulatory
*  provision. This is an emergency provision. There's an emergency. It's an earthquake. You don't think
*  Congress wanted to give and not just wanted. It's not what Congress thought. It's what Congress said
*  to give the secretary power to say, oh my gosh, people have had their homes wiped out. We're going
*  to discharge their student loans. And Campbell says no. Your Honor, when it comes to taking that
*  ultimate step to discharging loans, Congress wanted to preserve that for itself. That the Heroes
*  Act may allow some minor modifications, but not the wholesale forgiveness of student loans.
*  And how is Kagan during this exchange? She's increasingly exasperated.
*  And she turns to what the Liberals may think is their only real hope of prevailing in this case.
*  And that's a question the Court has answered before it reaches whether the Biden administration
*  had acted lawfully. And that's whether anyone has suffered the sort of harm that gives them
*  standing to sue. Adam remind me what do you mean by standing?
*  Well, the Constitution says the federal courts can only decide actual cases or controversies.
*  And that's understood to mean that you have to have a stake in the case. You can't just be
*  interested in, you know, Supreme Court, tell me, I'm not happy about what the Biden administration
*  has done here. And I'd like you to give me your opinion. You have to have been hurt. And the
*  result of the decision has to help you. So in other words, you have to be a party in the case,
*  someone injured in the case. Right. And in this case, there were serious questions about whether
*  any of the plaintiffs had standing to sue. The states mainly claim to be bringing their suit
*  on behalf of this semi independent Missouri entity, the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority,
*  which everyone calls Mojila, which they claimed would be hurt financially because of Biden's move.
*  Mojila is a interior general Crawford. Is that correct? Mojila is not here, but it's
*  being true. It has to be sued. It's been set up as an independent corporate entity
*  with the ability to bring suits on its own. And the solicitor general said yes,
*  that entity might have standing, but that entity was not before the court. And
*  neoliberal justices and justice Kagan in particular said, listen, it's an independent corporation.
*  It has chosen not to sue. Usually we don't allow one person to step into another's shoes and say,
*  I think that that person suffered a harm. Even if the harm is very great, we leave it to the person
*  him or her or itself to make that judgment. Now here she says, we don't think that a state should
*  be able to step into the shoes of an injured party and say that its harm translates into the
*  state's harm and gives it standing to sue. I guess there are third parties all the time who have
*  an interest in, gosh, I wish that party over there would bring a suit because I have some
*  relationship with that third party and I would like it very much if that third party represented
*  its own interests better in my view. But we don't do that. We don't allow that kind of interference
*  with the decision of the entity involved to decide whether the harm is of the kind that they want
*  to sue for. And the bottom line of all of these arguments and complications is that there are
*  serious questions about whether anyone has standing to sue and that might be the best argument
*  for the Liberals and for the Biden administration given how hostile the conservative majority was
*  to their basic claim that they have the right to cancel these loans under the heroes act.
*  Right. And from what you've said, it doesn't really seem like the conservative majority would be
*  that receptive to dismissing the case based on standing. They basically did not engage
*  on standing. So I suppose there's a remote possibility that the Biden administration pulls out a
*  win on that ground, although it doesn't seem likely. It seems like this will be yet another case
*  in which the court breaks along predictable lines with the six Republican appointees in the
*  majority. Another six to three. That's right. So in a way, this seems to be just another case that
*  will be decided on predictable partisan lines within the court. But to go back to the beginning of
*  our conversation, Adam, the Biden administration wasn't necessarily on sturdy legal footing to begin
*  with, right? I mean, it was a bit of a stretch legally and they knew it would be controversial
*  and they knew there would be court challenges. And yet they pushed it through right before an
*  election anyway. Right. So think about the politics of it for a second. It was surely good politics
*  for the Democrats in the midterms to have made this promise. And I'm not sure it's bad politics for
*  the Democrats to lose before a hostile Supreme Court. Politically, they could say to their base,
*  we did what we could. We're stuck with a court that routinely pushes back against our progressive
*  initiatives. And we're fighting as hard as we can. Adam, stepping back here, what does it mean
*  for the tens of millions of Americans who actually hold this debt? So we'll get a decision probably at
*  the end of June that will be full of legal concepts about standing in major questions, doctrine
*  and hero's act and presidential authority and separation of powers. And I don't think the
*  borrowers are going to read the decision. They're just going to look at the bottom line. And what that
*  bottom line seems to be is that they will feel robbed in a sense. They will feel that they had been
*  promised by the Biden administration, significant, sometimes life-altering debt relief coming out of
*  the pandemic. And it might feel a little ugly to them. It will represent a missed opportunity and
*  dashed hopes. Adam, thank you. Thank you, Sabrina. We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. On Wednesday, Israeli police used
*  stung grenades and water cannons against thousands of protesters in Tel Aviv, a significant
*  escalation in the confrontation between Israel's new government, the most right wing in the country's
*  history and its critics. Protests have been disrupting life in Israeli cities for eight weeks over
*  the new government's push to make changes to the country's Supreme Court. Opponents say the changes
*  threatened to turn Israel into an autocracy. Several dozen protesters were arrested and a number were injured.
