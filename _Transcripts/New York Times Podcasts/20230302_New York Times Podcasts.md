# Will the Supreme Court Let Biden Cancel Student Debt?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAxe4jIfp9I)
*  This is Sydney Harper, Daily Producer.
*  I'm here outside the Supreme Court in D.C.
*  It's Tuesday morning and I'm looking at a protest of a bunch of people who are here
*  in favor of the student loan debt cancellation program.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi and this is The Daily.
*  This week, the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case against President Biden's student
*  loan cancellation program.
*  That program would wipe out an astonishing $400 billion in student debt.
*  The case seeks to reverse that.
*  Hi y'all.
*  I'm just curious about people's student debt and I'm just trying to like hear some numbers
*  from people about what they owe.
*  Some numbers.
*  $25,000.
*  Yeah.
*  I think I have about like $40,000.
*  Oh!
*  For student loan debt?
*  Yeah.
*  How much?
*  Approximately $130,000 in student loans.
*  Your mouth is open right now.
*  That's a lie.
*  That is a lie.
*  What do you owe in loans?
*  Oh, $36,000 but I say $35,000 to make myself feel better.
*  That doesn't make you feel better?
*  No.
*  I just crossed six figures this year so it's extremely worrying that I'm not going to be
*  able to build that generational wealth for my children, my children's children so that
*  way they don't have to take out loans in college.
*  So I just worry about the future of my family and generations to come if I'm unable to get
*  out of this debt myself.
*  Today, my colleague Adam Liptak on how the court might rule and what that will mean for
*  more than 40 million Americans.
*  It's Thursday, March 2nd.
*  So Adam, tell us about the case the Supreme Court heard on Tuesday.
*  The Supreme Court is considering whether President Biden can embark on one of the most
*  ambitious and expensive executive actions ever.
*  It's a big case on a practical level but it's also a big case on a kind of legal and constitutional
*  structure level asking when the president is authorized to take such a big step and
*  what Congress had to do to give him that authority.
*  Tell us how we got here.
*  Well this, like so much of the life we lead these days has its roots in the pandemic.
*  And when the pandemic started in March of 2020, President Trump and his education secretary
*  Betsy DeVos decided that the pandemic warranted emergency action and that they would pause
*  repayment obligations for everyone who has federal student loans and also interest accrual.
*  And he relies on a 2003 law, the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act, people
*  call it the HEROES Act, initially passed after the September 11 attacks, says this, that
*  the education secretary can waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision to borrow
*  affected by a war or other military operation or national emergency.
*  And that phrase national emergency does all the work and it allows President Trump and
*  his education secretary Betsy DeVos to pause loan repayments and interest accrual.
*  Okay, so that's Trump easing the financial burden on millions of students.
*  Then Biden comes in.
*  What does he do?
*  Usually President Biden continues the loan pause.
*  It continues to cost the government lots and lots of money.
*  But there comes a time when he sees that the pandemic is going to end.
*  And back in August, he decides that the repayment pause would end and that instead, he would
*  forgive a great deal of the debt.
*  Relying on the HEROES Act, he would forgive $10,000 for people making $125,000 or less
*  or $20,000 for people who'd received Pell grants for poor students in college.
*  And this was in the face of some doubt on the scope of his authority, on whether he
*  had the power to make this enormous move of forgiving more than $400 billion of debt.
*  Yeah, that kind of action is obviously a step further than what both Trump and Biden had
*  been doing to that point.
*  So what's the response?
*  The response among Democrats and particularly among young Democrats was enormously enthusiastic.
*  And it also engendered a kind of fury on the right, who didn't think the president has
*  this power, who called him King Biden, and who promptly went to court all around the
*  country, but most notably in a case brought by six Republican-led states, to say the president
*  was not authorized to do this and that the HEROES Act did not give him the power to forgive
*  all this debt.
*  Right.
*  And all of that leads us to Tuesday with the arguments in this case before the Supreme Court.
*  So what happened in the court?
*  What did the administration say?
*  Well, I should mention that there were actually two cases about the Biden plan before the
*  court.
*  One was brought by two borrowers, but I think that case was minor and not likely to succeed.
*  Then there's the second one, the main one, which was brought by six states.
*  It was mainly on behalf of an agency in Missouri, which they claim was damaged by the Biden
*  plan.
*  And in that second case, again, the basic question was whether the coronavirus pandemic
*  justified under this HEROES Act of 2003, the wholesale cancellation of hundreds of billions
*  of dollars in student debt.
*  We'll hear argument first this morning in case 22506, Biden versus Nebraska.
*  The Biden administration, represented by the Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelager, makes
*  a couple of basic points.
*  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.
*  COVID-19 is the most devastating pandemic in our nation's history, and it has caused
*  enormous disruption and economic distress.
*  One is to remind the justices of what a devastating economic impact COVID had, particularly on
*  people with student debt.
*  Over the past three years, millions of Americans have struggled to pay rent, utilities, food,
*  and many have been unable to pay their debts.
*  And to say that it would cause a devastating blow to people and cause many of them to
*  default if they were made to repay the sums that the administration wants to forgive.
*  But if that forbearance ends without further relief, it's undisputed that defaults and
*  delinquencies will surge above pre-pandemic levels.
*  And then she went on to make the legal point.
*  Two secretaries across two administrations invoked the HEROES Act to suspend interest
*  and payment obligations for all Americans with federal...
*  That the HEROES Act, she says, completely and comfortably authorizes the Secretary of
*  Education to waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision which, she says, encompasses
*  student debt.
*  And how did the justices respond to that argument?
*  Well, the more conservative justices were not at all persuaded.
*  We're arguing here that the president can act unilaterally, that there was no role for
*  Congress to play in this either.
*  And Chief Justice Roberts, in particular, right out of the gate, says that if you're
*  going to spend these kinds of sums of money, you need particularly clear congressional
*  authorization and he didn't see it.
*  Now we take very seriously the idea of separation of powers and that powers should be divided
*  to prevent its abuse.
*  He thought that the separation of powers doesn't allow the executive to act on its own.
*  And he invoked a concept the court calls the major questions doctrine.
*  You would recognize, at least, that this is a case that presents extraordinarily serious
*  important issues about the role of Congress and about the role that we should exercise
*  in scrutinizing that?
*  Significant enough that the major questions doctrine ought to be considered implicated?
*  And Adam, what is the major questions doctrine?
*  It's a judicially created doctrine that says the bigger a deal is, the bigger the political
*  stakes are, the bigger the economic stakes are, the more Congress has to speak clearly.
*  That even if you have some statutory language that may authorize you to do something minor,
*  if it's a big enough deal and the Chief Justice says half a trillion dollars is certainly
*  a big enough deal, Congress has to speak exceptionally clearly.
*  Congress has to give really clear authority to the president to do what he wants to do
*  if the question is major.
*  Right.
*  But there is something that the conservatives are saying here that's true, which is like
*  there's a lot of money involved here, right?
*  So it does in a way feel like $400 billion would qualify as major.
*  Right.
*  And even Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal, says, well, on that, you know, she doesn't
*  disagree that the sums of money involved are major.
*  And I think probably the ordinary American, as a matter of common sense, would at least
*  want to know that Congress has blessed this idea.
*  So even if you have consensus that it's a lot of money, and most people would say, given
*  the sums of money involved, you want Congress to have blessed it, that just takes you back
*  to the Heroes Act.
*  In particular, to the question of what does waive or modify mean?
*  General, is this a waiver or is it a modification?
*  It's both a waiver and a modification, Justice Thomas.
*  A couple of the justices, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas, seem pretty clear
*  that they didn't think waive or modify meant cancel.
*  We're talking about half a trillion dollars.
*  How does that fit under the normal understanding of modifying?
*  That that was something different.
*  Well, would you take a minute to explain how a waiver or modification amounts to a waiver?
*  So you see that even on the court, people are struggling with just how far you can take
*  those words from 2003, waive or modify.
*  And how did the Biden administration respond to that skepticism about the language?
*  It said the language plainly covers exactly what happened here.
*  It talks about responding to an emergency.
*  Congress already made the judgment that in the context of a national emergency, you should
*  be able to…
*  She said Congress anticipated that it would be giving the Secretary of Education power
*  in an emergency to be nimble and aggressive.
*  So there's not the same mismatch here of taking an old statute and dusting it off and
*  deploying it in a context where Congress could never have imagined it would be used before.
*  And she said this is a perfect fit with the problem that the Secretary confronted.
*  So she seemed quite comfortable and confident that the statute gave them the power they invoked.
*  And were the justices convinced by that?
*  That the Biden administration actually had the full power to do it under the statute?
*  The right side of the court, the six-justice conservative majority, did not seem persuaded
*  by these arguments.
*  And some of them also talked about not buying it as a matter of fundamental fairness.
*  What I think they argue that is missing is cost to other persons in terms of fairness, for example.
*  So you had Justice Neil Gorsuch talking about what about people who've paid off their loans?
*  People who don't have planned their lives around not seeking loans and people who are
*  not eligible for loans in the first place.
*  And that a half a trillion dollars is being diverted to one group of favored persons over others.
*  And he said half a trillion dollars are being diverted to one group instead of another.
*  I didn't see anything in the memorandum that dealt with those kinds of questions.
*  And if there is something, I'd be appreciative if you could point me to it.
*  So at this point, we've really gone beyond the issue of separation of powers, it sounds like.
*  Like really the conservatives are taking issue with the program itself.
*  And we're really doubtful about the wisdom and fairness of the program.
*  Chief Justice Roberts proposes a distinction.
*  He says some people take out loans and go to college and they do very well in life.
*  And we're going to forgive those loans.
*  Some people start small businesses.
*  Some people start a lawn care business and take out loans.
*  We're not going to forgive those loans, even though those people typically might do less
*  well than people with college degrees.
*  Then he makes a characteristically smart pivot and says, but of course, my views of
*  fairness don't count, your views of fairness don't count.
*  But where there are questions of fairness in play, that is typically a question for Congress.
*  He says Congress decides how to spend taxpayers' money.
*  If there are questions of fairness involved, maybe Congress should have acted.
*  But the bottom line, Sabrina, is that the conservative justices were not buying what
*  the Biden administration was selling.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Adam, what did the state's lawyer argue?
*  I mean, the side that was suing the Biden administration.
*  James Campbell, Nebraska's Solicitor General, arguing for these six Republican-led states,
*  makes a couple of basic points.
*  First, he said, whatever the Trump administration did in the heat of the pandemic to pause loan
*  repayment for a relatively brief period of time, maybe fits within the Heroes Act, maybe
*  said to be a modification.
*  I think arguably that was a legitimate use of the Heroes Act because taking a congressionally
*  created six-month program and extending it for three months seems like it might be a
*  modification.
*  But now, with the pandemic receding and the completely different tack, he says, that the
*  Biden administration is taking, not pausing, but forgiving entirely huge sums of money,
*  he says, is clearly not authorized by the Heroes Act.
*  But now there were two years down the road where beyond a modification, and not only
*  that, the connection to the national emergency has become even more tenuous.
*  And how do the liberal justices respond to this argument?
*  I've got to say, Sabrina, they seemed a little incredulous.
*  Congress could not have made this much more clear.
*  I mean, Congress didn't say exactly the circumstances in which it wanted the secretary to use this
*  authority.
*  Of course not.
*  This is a bill about what happens when you have an emergency.
*  Justice Elena Kagan, for instance, says that Congress could hardly have been clearer.
*  Congress said the secretary could act where there was an emergency.
*  Nobody doubts that this was an emergency.
*  That's what happens when you give people emergency power.
*  And she has a back and forth with Mr. Campbell about a hypothetical.
*  So let me give you an example.
*  It sounds like there's an earthquake.
*  We'll use an earthquake instead of a pandemic.
*  What if it's an earthquake?
*  What if it's an earthquake instead of a pandemic?
*  Can the secretary allow loan forgiveness in that circumstance?
*  Could the secretary say, well, there was this terrible earthquake and lots of people's houses
*  were destroyed.
*  And I'm going to discharge the loans of people whose houses were destroyed in this terrible
*  earthquake.
*  And Campbell says, no, that's not a waiver or modification.
*  Your honor, it sounds to me like creating a new program.
*  I don't think that that would be okay under the Heroes Act.
*  Kagan responds, but this is very broad language.
*  You can modify or waive any statutory or regulatory provision.
*  This is an emergency provision.
*  There's an emergency.
*  It's an earthquake.
*  You don't think Congress wanted to give, and not just wanted, it's not what Congress thought,
*  it's what Congress said, to give the secretary power to say, oh my gosh, people have had
*  their homes wiped out.
*  We're going to discharge their student loans.
*  And Campbell says, no.
*  Your honor, when it comes to taking that ultimate step to discharging loans, Congress wanted
*  to preserve that for itself.
*  That the Heroes Act may allow some minor modifications, but not the wholesale forgiveness of student
*  loans.
*  And how is Kagan during this exchange?
*  She's increasingly exasperated.
*  And she turns to what the liberals may think is their only real hope of prevailing in this
*  case.
*  And that's a question the court has to answer before it reaches whether the Biden administration
*  had acted lawfully.
*  And that's whether anyone has suffered the sort of harm that gives them standing to sue.
*  Adam, remind me, what do you mean by standing?
*  Well, the Constitution says the federal courts can only decide actual cases or controversies.
*  And that's understood to mean that you have to have a stake in the case.
*  You can't just be interested in, you know, Supreme Court, tell me, I'm not happy about
*  what the Biden administration has done here, and I'd like you to give me your opinion.
*  You have to have been hurt.
*  And the result of the decision has to help you.
*  So in other words, you have to be a party in the case, someone injured in the case.
*  Right.
*  And in this case, there were serious questions about whether any of the plaintiffs had standing
*  to sue.
*  The states mainly claimed to be bringing their suit on behalf of this semi-independent Missouri
*  entity, the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority, which everyone calls Moheela, which
*  they claimed would be hurt financially because of Biden's move.
*  Moheela isn't here, General Crawford.
*  Is that correct?
*  Moheela is not here, but its interests are here.
*  It has the ability to sue and be sued.
*  It's been set up as an independent corporate entity with the ability to bring suits on
*  its own.
*  And the Solicitor General said, yes, that entity might have standing.
*  But that entity was not before the court.
*  The liberal justices and Justice Kagan in particular said, listen, it's an independent
*  corporation.
*  It has chosen not to sue.
*  Usually we don't allow one person to step into another's shoes and say, I think that
*  that person suffered a harm, even if the harm is very great.
*  We leave it to the person, him or her or itself, to make that judgment.
*  She says, we don't think that a state should be able to step into the shoes of an injured
*  party and say that its harm translates into the state's harm and gives it standing to
*  sue.
*  I mean, there are third parties all the time who have an interest in, gosh, I wish that
*  party over there would bring a suit because I have some relationship with that third party
*  and I would like it very much if that third party represented its own interests better
*  in my view.
*  But we don't do that.
*  We don't allow that kind of interference with the decision of the entity involved to decide
*  whether the harm is of the kind that they want to sue for.
*  And the bottom line of all of these arguments and complications is that there are serious
*  questions about whether anyone has standing to sue.
*  And that might be the best argument for the liberals and for the Biden administration,
*  given how hostile the conservative majority was to their basic claim that they have the
*  right to cancel these loans under the Heroes Act.
*  Right.
*  And from what you've said, it doesn't really seem like the conservative majority would
*  be that receptive to dismissing the case based on standing.
*  They basically did not engage on standing.
*  So I suppose there's a remote possibility that the Biden administration pulls out a
*  win on that ground, although it doesn't seem likely.
*  It seems like this will be yet another case in which the court breaks along predictable
*  lines with the six Republican appointees in the majority.
*  Another six to three.
*  That's right.
*  So in a way, this seems to be just another case that will be decided on predictable partisan
*  lines within the court.
*  But to go back to the beginning of our conversation, Adam, the Biden administration wasn't necessarily
*  on sturdy legal footing to begin with.
*  Right.
*  I mean, it was a bit of a stretch legally, and they knew it would be controversial and
*  they knew there would be court challenges.
*  And yet they pushed it through right before an election anyway.
*  Right.
*  So think about the politics of it for a second.
*  It was surely good politics for the Democrats in the midterms to have made this promise.
*  And I'm not sure it's bad politics for the Democrats to lose before a hostile Supreme
*  Court.
*  Politically, they could say to their base, we did what we could.
*  We're stuck with a court that routinely pushes back against our progressive initiatives,
*  and we're fighting as hard as we can.
*  Adam, stepping back here, what does it mean for the tens of millions of Americans who
*  actually hold this debt?
*  So we'll get a decision probably at the end of June that will be full of legal concepts
*  about standing and major questions, doctrine and Heroes Act and presidential authority
*  and separation of powers.
*  And I don't think the borrowers are going to read the decision.
*  They're just going to look at the bottom line.
*  And what that bottom line seems to be is that they will feel robbed in a sense.
*  They will feel that they had been promised by the Biden administration significant, sometimes
*  life altering debt relief coming out of the pandemic.
*  And it might feel a little ugly to them.
*  It will represent a missed opportunity and dashed hopes.
*  Adam, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Wednesday, Israeli police used stun grenades and water cannons against thousands of protesters
*  in Tel Aviv, a significant escalation in the confrontation between Israel's new government,
*  the most right wing in the country's history, and its critics.
*  Protests have been disrupting life in Israeli cities for eight weeks over the new government's
*  push to make changes to the country's Supreme Court.
*  Opponents say the changes threaten to turn Israel into an autocracy.
*  Several dozen protesters were arrested and a number were injured.
