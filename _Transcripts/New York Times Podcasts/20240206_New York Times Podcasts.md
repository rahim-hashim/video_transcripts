*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernice and this is The Daily.
*  We turn out to Israel where a growing list of countries around the world have suspended
*  funding to a UN refugee agency for Palestinians.
*  Israel has now shared its intelligence, claiming at least 13 UN aid workers actually took part
*  in the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7th.
*  The last month, an explosive allegation that workers from a crucial UN Relief Agency
*  in Gaza had taken part in the October 7th attacks, stunned the world, and prompted major
*  donors, including the US, to suspend funding today.
*  Jerusalem bureau chief Patrick Kingsley on what this could mean for the humanitarian crisis
*  in Gaza and how it might complicate Israel's strategy in the war.
*  It's Tuesday, February 6th.
*  Patrick, hi.
*  Hi Sabrina.
*  So the last time we talked late last year, there was this growing humanitarian crisis in
*  Gaza.
*  Most of the population had been displaced, disease and hunger were starting to emerge as bigger
*  and bigger problems.
*  Now the situation has gotten worse.
*  And in the midst of all of this, the main UN Relief Agency in Gaza, known as UNRA,
*  has been engulfed in scandal over accusations that some of its staff actually played a role
*  in the October 7th attack.
*  Yes.
*  So tell me the story in what we know.
*  What we know is this.
*  On January 18th, the head of Amra, Philip Nazareini, went to what was expected to be a routine
*  meeting with a senior Israeli diplomat to discuss delivery of aid and fuel to Gaza, the
*  supplies that Amra helps to coordinate.
*  Instead, the Israeli diplomat dropped a bombshell accusation.
*  He claimed that roughly a dozen employees of Amra had either participated in the Hamas
*  led raid on Israel on October 7th or in one case in its aftermath.
*  Wow.
*  So that is quite a bombshell.
*  It's a very serious allegation.
*  This is just a small tiny minority of the 13,000 employees of Amra in Gaza.
*  But nevertheless, it's too many.
*  And certainly not what you expect of a UN Agency that is devoted to neutrality and humanitarianism.
*  Right.
*  So actually tell us what this agency does in Gaza.
*  Amra is the main aid organization for Palestinians that is run by the United Nations.
*  In times outside war, it provides education and primary health care for roughly 5 million
*  Palestinians across the Middle East, including more than a million in Gaza itself.
*  It runs hundreds of schools and provides education for roughly 300,000 guards and children.
*  Since the war has begun, it has been the primary supplier of shelter to displaced Palestinians.
*  More than half the population is now living in an Amra facility.
*  Its schools and other facilities have provided a roof over the head of some 1.2 million
*  guards and since the start of the war.
*  A crucial organization, especially in this moment.
*  Yes, absolutely.
*  And after that meeting with the senior Israeli diplomat, Lazareini, the head of Amra, begins
*  to fire 9 of the employees who are accused of participating in the attack.
*  Two of them, we believe, are already dead and at least one of them in the attack itself.
*  Then the UN starts to tell the donor states that provide Amra with most of its funding,
*  chief among the United States.
*  And that led to senior American diplomats being briefed on the claims and they were presented
*  by Israeli officials with a dossier outlining these claims.
*  On that same day, Amra decided to announce to the world that these allegations have been
*  made against some of their employees and that some of them had already been fired.
*  Now the UN has fired 9 and remembers that we understand two more are being looked into.
*  And that news led the United States and then a cascade of more than a dozen other countries
*  to suspend their funding for Amra pending further investigation.
*  The US has paused funding to the UN agency that is actually providing aid to the Palestinians.
*  Canada announced it too has temporarily paused any additional.
*  And this came on the same day hours after the UN's top court ordered Israel to take measures
*  to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza.
*  That the International Court of Justice in the Hague had ruled that in order to prevent
*  a genocide Israel needed to supply more aid to Gaza.
*  And so at a time when more aid was supposed to be coming in to Gaza, the UN's biggest
*  aid agency was running the risk of collapse.
*  The head of Amra is calling for all those nations who are suspending funding right now to
*  change their minds.
*  Given the desperate quite of so many, this would be a heavy blow if Amra's operations were
*  suspended in some way.
*  And indeed we've been told by Amra's leadership that if the funds aren't restored by the end
*  of February, it will struggle to operate.
*  That could have grave implications for the distribution of aid and the provision of shelter
*  to more than a million garsens just at the wrong time.
*  Just as we're told that the family is looming in parts of Gaza more than half the buildings
*  in Gaza are damaged or destroyed according to UN estimates.
*  And around 2 million people out of 2.2 million have been displaced.
*  So it couldn't be happening this convergence of events at a worse time.
*  Right.
*  An already bad situation is likely to get a lot worse for gossens.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  What were the actual charges, Patrick?
*  I mean, what did you learn about that?
*  Well, to begin with, it really wasn't clear what the specific allegations were.
*  We had this statement from Amra saying that there were claims against various employees.
*  There was talk of a dossier, but no one was releasing any information.
*  So what me and our colleague, Renem Bergman, did, we spent the weekend calling up as many
*  sources as we could reach, trying to find out exactly what this dossier had said.
*  And two days after the allegations broke, we finally got our hands on the dossier itself.
*  And what it alleged was shocking.
*  It said that, for example, one of the employees, a teacher, had been involved in a raid
*  on the Israeli village of Beteree, where roughly 100 people were killed during the October 7th attack.
*  It said another person was involved in the kidnapping of a woman.
*  It said that a third person was involved in the capture of a soldier's corpse on October 7th.
*  And so on and so on.
*  The list went on.
*  The dossier said the information was mainly taken from wiretaps of people's phones
*  and also through the geolocation of people's phones on the day of October 7th.
*  We could only confirm the identity of one of the people accused,
*  but we had no way of verifying the material ourselves.
*  All we knew was that Amra had decided themselves to take action both firing nine people
*  and announcing the news publicly.
*  And that wasn't all.
*  The dossier also had another claim, an even bigger claim, that had not previously been reported.
*  And that was that according to the Israeli military,
*  roughly a tenth of Amra's staff of 13,000 inside Gaza were affiliated or members of Hamas
*  and other militant factions.
*  Wow.
*  And this was an astonishing claim for an agency that is supposed to be neutral,
*  supposed to be independent of political groups, let alone armed groups.
*  Right.
*  And once again, this was an impossible to verify claim
*  and the Israelis have not publicly produced any evidence to support it.
*  Nevertheless, they say that this calculation is taken by cross referencing a list of Amra staff members in Gaza
*  with lists or a list of Hamas members that the Israeli military had taken during its invasion of Gaza
*  from computers that they found in Hamas bases inside the territory.
*  But Patrick, what exactly does Israel mean when it says 10% of the staff, some 1300 people,
*  were considered members of Hamas?
*  Like are we talking about militants?
*  Are we talking about government bureaucrats?
*  Because of course Hamas is the government of Gaza.
*  The claim was that roughly 200 of those 1300 were involved in militant activities.
*  The rest of the 1300s, so the vast majority, were people involved in the political movement or the social movement of Hamas.
*  Remember that Hamas is not just an armed faction that fires rockets at Israel or that attacks Israel on October 7th.
*  It's also a social movement that has deep roots in society and helps to run a civilian government.
*  And there is quite a lot of overlap between its membership and the general population of Gaza,
*  which is not to say that the majority of Gaza are affiliated with Hamas,
*  but just to say that in a way, it's not that surprising that any large institution in Gaza would have some level of overlap
*  with a political movement and a social movement as large as Hamas.
*  Umar takes its staff predominantly in Gaza from the population of Gaza.
*  The 13,000 Umar staff members are mostly not international aid workers from other countries.
*  They come from the place that they are working in Gaza.
*  And indeed, if you go anywhere in the world, any experienced aid worker will tell you that it's a constant challenge
*  to maintain independence from any armed group or rebel group, be it in South Sudan or Northern Sri Lanka.
*  And that these are common challenges that affect the aid sector or ever they work.
*  All that said, the UN is supposed to be a politically neutral body and that's what gives the UN its gravitas and its power.
*  This is an institution that's meant to be above politics, above division,
*  and it's not supposed to be compromised by any party to accomplish.
*  So its workers should not be members of Hamas or any other Palestinian political armed group for that matter.
*  Right. If it's true, this claim would be hugely damning.
*  Yes. And once this information, this 10% figure was brought to the attention of the wider world,
*  it cemented in the eyes of Umar's critics the idea that something was rotten within Umar.
*  And that came as more countries suspended their funding.
*  And it led a couple of days later.
*  And I think it's time that the international community in the UN itself understand that Umar's mission has to end.
*  To Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, breaking his silence on the issue,
*  calling specifically for Umar's dissolution.
*  There are other agencies in the UN, there are other agencies in the world, they have to replace Umar.
*  What if anything has Hamas said about this?
*  I mean, do they confirm or deny that these folks are, in fact, members of Hamas?
*  So I asked the Hamas folks in that question and didn't get a clear answer.
*  What they have publicly said is that they condemn Umar for criticizing the actions of anyone who has
*  participated in what they see as legitimate resistance against Israel, but what much of the
*  world sees as acts of brutal terrorism. And they also criticized Umar for firing some of its
*  employees based on material given to it by Hamas's enemy, Israel.
*  So Patrick, this relationship between UNRAN Hamas is very fraught.
*  UNRAN is responsible for critical services in Gaza, you know, social safety net for a big swath
*  of the country. And that's in normal times. And has to navigate working side-by-side with the
*  government, which is Hamas, which is considered a terrorist group by the US and the EU and others.
*  And now in the midst of the war, Umar is even more critical to the people of Gaza, who are trying
*  to survive the bombardments and the invasion following Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.
*  But Umar is also now facing this scrutiny for having staff associated with that attack.
*  So that's all very complicated.
*  It's hugely complicated. Umar is independent of Hamas. It's got
*  formerly nothing to do with the group, but it nevertheless operates within a dictatorial regime
*  in which Hamas is the ruler. And that forces it to work side-by-side with Hamas.
*  And at the same time, they also have to coordinate with the Israeli Armed Forces in order to
*  ensure that aid and other supplies and also their own international employees can enter and exit
*  Gaza. So this has all been very difficult to navigate for years. During the 2021 war with Israel,
*  for example, or just after it, the most senior Umar official in Gaza made comments that
*  were perceived to be favorable towards Israel's military operations. And there was such an
*  outcry in Gaza from Hamas because of that that this official was withdrawn from Umar.
*  But from the Israeli perspective, this kind of tension between Umar and Hamas is a
*  fig leaf that obscures a more symbiotic relationship in which Umar is not fully independent
*  and operates in their view under Hamas's influence. Umar denies that completely and says that
*  it's totally neutral. But nevertheless, the accusation has long been that Umar works under the
*  influence of Hamas. So in a way, this latest incident is just one in a long line of flashpoints
*  between Umar and Israel that goes back decades. If for Palestinians Umar is an icon and something
*  of a protector, to many Israelis, it's a consistent problem. And this latest incident simply
*  confirms perceptions that Israelis have long held about the group.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Patrick, you said that many in Israel have long believed that Unroute is a consistent problem.
*  What do you mean by that? What I mean is they take issue with what they say that the agency
*  fundamentally stands for. And that goes all the way back to the reasons why it was founded in 1949.
*  A year after Israel was founded.
*  At that time, you had roughly more than 700,000 Palestinian refugees who had fled or been forced
*  from their homes during the wars that surrounded the creation of the state of Israel. And to care for
*  those refugees who have been scattered all across the Middle East in Lebanon, Jordan and in Gaza,
*  the UN founded one of the first UN agencies in its history. It was called the UN Relief and Works
*  Agency for Palestine Refugees or Unroute for Short. And each job was to provide education and other
*  services to those refugees. And for the 74 years since, it has basically
*  acted implicitly, if not directly, to maintain the identity of those Palestinian refugees.
*  And to, in the Israeli view, sustain the idea in those refugees minds that one day,
*  because the refugees, they might actually return to the place that they were forced from. And they
*  might, one day, come back, live in the homes that their families lived in in what became Israel.
*  But to Israelis, that is an enormously threatening idea because if you had 5 million Palestinians
*  returning to Israel as these refugees in their descendants now, number, it would completely dilute
*  the Jewish character of the Jewish state and Israeli-Somanda. To Israelis, it's also threatening because
*  the idea of 5 million people coming from territory where Israel has fought many wars for decades with
*  is a security threat. It's also a logistical threat. How would it work if 5 million people,
*  or even a small minority, come to Israel and try to move into the villages where they want to live,
*  many of which were destroyed? Right. Then there's another perspective which, more or less,
*  acknowledges all the criticisms that Israel makes about the very character of the institution of
*  Amra. But in the Palestinian perspective, this is a good thing. While many people who were classified
*  today as Palestinian refugees were not alive in 1948, they nevertheless feel that it is their
*  right to return to land on which their ancestors lived on many years previously. So in a sense,
*  there's quite a lot of common ground between the Israeli and Palestinian perspective of Amra. One
*  side just thinks it's a bad thing and the other thinks it's a good thing. It's what I guess I
*  get how this agency could symbolically represent a threat to Israel. But in reality, how much
*  is this aid organization actually a threat to the state of Israel? I mean, how much are they
*  actually working toward Palestinians getting to return to what is now Israel? Well, the claim is not
*  that the leaders of Amra are going around directly mobilizing Palestinian refugees to return
*  to Israel. A lot of debate around Amra centers on what is taught in its schools. In Israel, it has
*  not got our notice that of the dozen people accused of participating in the October 7 attack.
*  Several of them were either teachers or workers in those schools. And the curriculums in those schools
*  have also come under tremendous Israeli scrutiny. In one case, researchers highlighted how a textbook
*  glorified a Palestinian militant who was involved in a terror attack on Israeli civilians
*  in the 1970s called Dallal Mograbi. And in other cases, Israeli researchers have highlighted maps
*  of Palestine published in textbooks used in Amra schools that do not include the state of Israel.
*  Amra has, in some cases, acknowledged these criticisms and has said it's taken action to
*  withdraw those particular materials from circulation. And Palestinians, for their part, also make
*  similar criticisms of the Israeli education system where you often see maps of Israel that don't
*  include the West Bank or Gaza or assume that the West Bank is part of the state of Israel.
*  And Palestinians, in general, point out that the education system that is provided in Amra schools
*  and in other parts of the Palestinian education system is of a fairly good standard,
*  literacy rates among Palestinians as stands at 95%, which is nearly 10 points higher than the
*  global average. The other major criticism that Israelis make about Amra is that it somehow turns
*  a blind eye to Hamas' militant activity that Hamas or other militant groups have stored ammunition
*  inside Amra facilities or have fired rockets from very close to Amra schools or even dug tunnels
*  underneath its buildings. And Amra says that when it finds out about this, it takes action and has
*  even publicized some of these transgressions itself. And ultimately, it can't do much if people
*  fire rockets from close to its schools. It's not an armed institution and has no means of combating
*  that. So for the critics of Amra, the idea is basically that Amra is supporting the Hamas agenda,
*  which is of course the destruction of Israel, through propaganda and then looking the other way
*  when Hamas uses their facilities for war. But Amra is saying we don't have a military to stop
*  any of this stuff. We're just trying to provide services the best we can in an extremely difficult
*  environment. Yes, and that's why in allegation like the ones we've been hearing in recent days,
*  they've been so damaging because it suggests that Amra isn't just independent institution
*  working within a difficult environment, but it has been infiltrated by people who are members
*  of the group that the UN is saying it's independent from. So I have to imagine that people who
*  have been making these accusations all of these years are feeling pretty satisfied that these
*  allegations have come to light and are being seen by the world and taken seriously by the world.
*  I think yes and no. Some people are delighted they're saying we've always said this and finally
*  these ideas are getting prime time. Others may agree fundamentally that Amra is this nefarious
*  organization, but they don't feel this is the time to try and bring it down because as much as
*  they dislike the premise of what Amra stands for, they recognize that it plays a huge and important
*  role in sustaining life ultimately during a devastating war that has killed roughly one and a hundred
*  garsens according to cards and official estimates and they don't have a plan for what could replace
*  Amra and who could step in who has the manpower and the logistical footprint to deliver aid to
*  provide shelter and there are fears that if Amra collapses it would hugely worsen what is already a
*  very dire humanitarian situation. Right. I've spoken to Israeli officials and former officials
*  and they see it as part of a lack of strategic planning on the part of the Israeli government
*  which is avoiding very difficult questions about what Israel wants to see in Gaza after the war
*  ebbs and for some of them it's also exactly the wrong thing to be doing at a time when Israel
*  stands accused of genocide and in particular when the world's highest court, the international court
*  of justice in the Hague has just ordered Israel to prevent genocide in part by increasing more aid
*  to Gaza and on the same day that that order was made we instead see a number of countries start
*  pulling funding for the biggest aid operation in the Gaza Strip which raises questions about whether
*  in fact we'll see less aid rather than more. Right. Obviously the question of aid is most critical
*  to the ongoing struggle of garsens to simply survive this war but for Israel the idea that the
*  main aid agency in Gaza would be hobbled and therefore the humanitarian crisis there would get worse
*  is both a practical problem but also a problem for how the world sees Israel in this moment.
*  Absolutely it's a perception problem for Israel but it's also a perception problem for many of the
*  western countries including the United States who were the first to pull funding for Umbra as this
*  scandal broke. If Israel has a reputation problem as a result this war so too does the United States
*  and the Biden administration because of its support for Israel and its own reputation and perceptions
*  of its intentions are also wrapped up in Israel's fate and garsers. Yeah it's a very tricky situation for
*  the US and other funders. On the one hand they don't want to be perceived as having anything to do
*  with anyone who has anything to do with Hamas. On the other hand they also don't want to be seen
*  being responsible in any way for this humanitarian crisis. One that will get worse if the one real aid
*  organization goes away. Exactly but we have seen attempts by US officials to cast this suspension
*  in a different light. We've seen stories come out saying that actually the US was not due to
*  send more funding for a while and that the last remaining tronche of the funding it was supposed
*  to provide in this particular funding cycle was minimal and that in essence the suspension was
*  more of a symbolic move than one that would actually have practical effect on Amr's budget.
*  So kind of trying to walk it back a bit. Exactly. All that said while the US is the main funder or
*  the largest funder of Amr the collective effect of all the other suspensions from more than a
*  dozen other countries could well be damaging enough to leave Amr in major trouble and according
*  to Amr it could go out of business they say by the end of the month because there are so many
*  other suspensions of funding from other sources. So actually many in Israel you know the US and
*  countries around the world and most of all gossens are aligned in having pretty serious interest
*  in unrenot collapsing right now. Exactly and the key words there are right now while this war
*  goes on certainly there is a strange and perhaps surprising alignment of interests if not motives.
*  Right. In the long term of course there remain profound disagreements not only about the future of
*  Amr but the future of Gaza and who should govern it what role should Hamas play what role should
*  Israel play what role should other Palestinian leaders play and of course what role should
*  Amr play and should it play any role at all. Israel wants to see a completely different
*  architecture of aid agencies and aid distribution others think it's entirely the wrong time to be
*  discussing revamping the aid system in a territory where more than 80% of people are displaced
*  more than half the buildings are damaged or destroyed and one in a hundred people has been killed.
*  Patrick thank you. Thank you Sabrina.
*  The Times reports that UNRA is set to lose at least $65 million by the end of February as funding cuts
*  made by donors begin to kick in. In all 18 states or institutions announced suspensions of funding
*  some like the United States had already made scheduled payments but others including Finland,
*  Germany, Japan and Sweden had not and are now set to miss them.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. On Monday a powerful storm pummeled California for a second day
*  with wind and rain causing flooding mudslides and widespread power outages.
*  The relentless downpour which began on Sunday morning dumped a record amount of rain on Los Angeles
*  making Sunday the 10th wednesday in the history of the city. At least three people died across the state
*  including from falling trees in northern California. On Monday afternoon as the rain continued
*  officials warned of the potential danger of more flooding and mudslides.
