# At the Democratic Convention, a Historic Nomination
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRLB_gHoR5Q)
*  I'm standing in a sea of people coming out of this vast convention and people are holding
*  signs, smiling.
*  There's confetti everywhere.
*  There are balloons, white, red, and blue.
*  And there's a lot of excitement.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi.
*  And this is The Daily from inside the Democratic National Convention Hall, where Kamala Harris
*  has just accepted her party's nomination, becoming the first woman of color in U.S.
*  history to do so.
*  Today, the story this convention told about Harris and whether that story could be enough
*  to win.
*  It's Friday, August 23rd.
*  The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day.
*  What shall our legacy be?
*  What will our children say?
*  Let me know in my heart when my days are through.
*  America, America, I gave my best to you.
*  On night one of the Democratic National Convention, the evening was really defined by this very
*  emotional, quite bittersweet goodbye from President Biden.
*  And there's nothing we cannot do when we do it together.
*  God bless you all and may God protect our troops.
*  It was the closing of one chapter so that another could begin.
*  It was Kamala Harris's moment.
*  So right now it's 740.
*  We are on the floor at the Democratic National Convention.
*  It is a crazy party atmosphere, which is like a massive understatement.
*  Day two kicked off with delegates gathering on the convention floor, casting their votes
*  in a kind of symbolic way to make Harris the party's nominee.
*  This giant festival of lights, people in cowboy hats, people with blinking bracelets, people
*  with Christmas lights wrapped around their hats, heads, shoulders, people wearing donkey
*  hats.
*  It's very, very, very celebratory in here.
*  We need to see that we're moving on.
*  We're turning a chapter in America.
*  How do you feel right now?
*  Awesome, excited, energized, ready to win this election.
*  I love it, I love it, I love it.
*  People are just excited, electrified, and they're just loving it and they're happy.
*  This has been the most electrifying event I've ever attended in my life.
*  It's my first convention, but what a convention to come for, right?
*  To make history right now as we charge forward to November 5th to elect the first female
*  Black president.
*  I'm excited.
*  So with Harris now the nominee, a new campaign slogan appeared everywhere, and that was
*  a new way forward.
*  But in a campaign that's just four weeks old, it was really an open question what a new
*  way forward actually meant.
*  We're not going back!
*  We're not going back!
*  We're not going back!
*  And then over the course of the week, as speaker after speaker took the stage, we started to
*  get an answer.
*  The story of forward would be told through the story of Kamala Harris herself.
*  And the question hanging over the week was really whether that story could appeal to
*  a broad majority of Americans, voters outside of the convention hall, who will ultimately
*  decide the election.
*  Astaed, welcome to the show.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  Again, the second time in a week, and I'm very excited for it.
*  Me too.
*  So Astaed, we had you on the show on Monday to answer a question for us that I think a
*  lot of people have, which is who is Kamala Harris?
*  You ended that conversation by saying that the Democratic Party also recognizes this
*  reality that for a lot of people, she is still this sort of unknown quantity.
*  And that the party had a big task here at the convention this week, which was to find
*  a way to finally tell her story.
*  Does seem like they've tried to do that.
*  So let's walk through the case that they're making for her and what you've seen here in
*  your reporting for your show, The Run Up.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that the Democrats have definitely laid out a case for her as a candidate, but
*  also a story for her as a person.
*  They have leaned into the different parts of her biography to really follow through
*  on what I think is the best version of her campaign, which is a little bit for everybody.
*  There is a story there about more moderate legislation, but pieces of progressive history.
*  There's different parts of her bio that speak to black communities, immigrant communities.
*  Of course, the historic nature of her gender and the roles like that.
*  And I really think it has followed through on kind of what I expected for this week,
*  which is that she seems to function politically as a mirror of some sorts, where the party
*  wants to position her as someone who basically, no matter what you're looking for in terms
*  of a vessel to beat Donald Trump, you can find it in this candidate.
*  So let's dig into that more.
*  Where did the convention start that story?
*  Hello, Democrats!
*  Yeah, I think it really starts in her personal biography.
*  And I'm here tonight to tell you all about the Kamala Harris that I know.
*  They have told a story that she often tells about her being a first generation American.
*  Her mother moved here from India at night.
*  Being a daughter of an immigrant mother who really raised two daughters in the Bay Area
*  from kind of working class roots.
*  And that's been a real thing that they've tried to own.
*  Kamala was not born into privilege.
*  She had to work for what she's got.
*  When she was young, she worked at McDonald's.
*  They talk about her working at McDonald's in college.
*  And she greeted every person with that thousand watt smile and said, how can I help you?
*  I think it's overall about trying to present this as someone who pulled himself up by bootstrap.
*  So it presents an American dream.
*  And I think for Democrats, it really returns them back to the place they want to be.
*  Democrats like thinking of themselves as a party who appeals to the diversity of America,
*  both in racial ways and gender ways, but also in class ways.
*  In Kamala Harris, we have a chance to elect a president who is for the middle class
*  because she is from the middle class.
*  And I think they used other parts of her identity,
*  specifically thinking about being the first black woman to accept a major party's nomination.
*  We know folks are going to do everything they can to distort her truth.
*  And I think Michelle Obama's speech specifically spoke to the power and anxiety
*  that sometimes that identity can bring.
*  My husband and I sadly know a little something about this.
*  For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us.
*  See, his limited narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two
*  hard-working, highly educated, successful people who happen to be black.
*  And I would also say that it was an implicit response to what Republicans and others have
*  been trying to say, talking about Kamala Harris as a DEI hire, someone who was only
*  in their position because of their identity.
*  But the way that Michelle Obama framed it was that those identities have power.
*  I want to know.
*  I want to know.
*  Who's going to tell him that the job he's currently seeking might just be one of those black jobs?
*  Just because someone refers to be in a position does not mean that that is the only reason in
*  the position. But it also doesn't make those identities meaningless.
*  The fact that she is a black woman should be seen as a strength, not as a weakness.
*  Is there a risk to that, though? I mean, you know, by openly talking about race,
*  is there a risk that goes too far and begins to alienate voters outside the convention,
*  out in the world, who, you know, they need to win in November?
*  I mean, there's always a risk, but I don't really think so.
*  Democrats have had increasing trouble with black voters.
*  There's been a downturn in black vote share all the way dating back to 2012.
*  And Biden's now suspended candidacy.
*  That was one of the things driving his polling weaknesses was kind of tepid
*  reception from black voters.
*  You know, a pitch to them is something that is an upside of the Kamala Harris campaign,
*  and the hope that they could consolidate that community is where any Democratic
*  nominee needs to be as a baseline.
*  One thing I noticed that came up a lot during the speeches was her background as a prosecutor.
*  How did the party present that part of her biography?
*  of sexual abuse.
*  She put rapists, child molesters, and murderers behind bars.
*  They talk about it in the way that I think fuels what they want to say
*  is the reason she can take on Trump.
*  That this is someone who has stood up to bullies before,
*  who's not going to be intimidated easily.
*  And Kamala is as tough as it comes.
*  Who's tough and who doesn't shirk away from a challenge.
*  And she knows the best way to deal with a coward is to take him head on.
*  Because we all know cowards are weak and Kamala Harris can smell weakness.
*  I think all of that adds up to say you can trust this person to go up against Donald Trump.
*  You can trust this person to go up against the Republican party
*  because she's not someone who is scared.
*  She never runs from a fight.
*  A woman, a fierce woman, for the people.
*  But then of course we heard about another side of Kamala Harris, a more personal side.
*  Yeah, and I think this is the part of Kamala Harris where I think was kind of most missing
*  in the presidential run.
*  Frankly, it's the part that she keeps most private.
*  She is a warm family member and friend.
*  Hello to my big, beautiful, blended family up there.
*  And I think what the speech from her husband did was really show
*  and lay that out.
*  I got married, became a dad to Cole and Ella.
*  Unfortunately, I went through a divorce.
*  But I eventually started worrying about how I would make it all work.
*  And that's when something unexpected happened.
*  I ended up with Kamala Harris' phone number.
*  He talks about the kind of awkwardness of their first interaction.
*  I got Kamala's voicemail and I did a phone call with her.
*  I got Kamala's voicemail and I just started rambling.
*  Hey, it's Doug.
*  And I think you have a real kind of sense of their genuine connection to one another.
*  By the way, Kamala saved that voicemail.
*  And she makes me listen to it on every anniversary.
*  Like, yes, this is someone who is tough, who is taking on corporations and cartels and all of that stuff by day.
*  But it's someone who also makes a point to cook Sunday dinner for family every week.
*  And she makes a mean brisket for Passover.
*  And makes sure to really go close to his kids and is very close with her family.
*  That's Kamala.
*  She's always been there for our children.
*  And I know she'll always be there for yours, too.
*  You know, going back to the last time the Democratic Party nominated a woman, Hillary Clinton,
*  she had presented herself in a very different way, right?
*  She was like, kind of ran away from that stuff.
*  She was saying, you know, I don't bake cookies.
*  That's not what I do.
*  I'm kind of out there with the men fighting.
*  And this convention and this candidate, Harris, is very different.
*  She's a newer generation and she can do her career and bake cookies.
*  Those things are not in conflict.
*  This is like a different type of woman leader.
*  You know, this week we talked to Senator Elizabeth Warren on the run up.
*  And one of the things that she mentioned was she feels that there's been a big change from
*  2016, even 2020, to now.
*  Not just the amount of women in public office.
*  But she said they don't have to choose between sides of themselves.
*  And I think that's what diversity means, right?
*  Like, of course, Kamala Harris can be a tough politician, but she's not going to be a tough
*  politician.
*  Kamala Harris can be a tough politician and also bake cookies.
*  Hillary Clinton did that, too.
*  It was just that she was told that that was not the way that she had to present herself.
*  What Kamala Harris is benefiting from is there's a greater space and the ability to choose
*  multiple things at once.
*  And so particularly if others are going to talk more directly about gender or race or
*  other things, that kind of frees her from having the burden of doing that herself.
*  And in fact, Hillary Clinton herself did speak, of course, on day one.
*  She talked about that glass ceiling in the history that has led to now, including her
*  own experience in 2016.
*  Yeah, I thought the Hillary Clinton speech was really powerful.
*  I think a lot of the speakers put this moment in kind of historical context, both politically
*  and personally.
*  You know, my mother, Dorothy, was born right here in Chicago before women had the right
*  to vote.
*  That changed 104 years ago yesterday.
*  And since that day, every generation has carried the torch forward.
*  In 1972, a fearless black congresswoman named Shirley Chisholm, she ran for president.
*  In 1984, I brought my daughter to see Geraldine Ferraro, the first woman nominated for vice
*  president.
*  And then there was 2016, when it was the honor of my life to accept our party's nomination
*  for president.
*  The last time I was here in my hometown was to memorialize my mother, the woman who showed
*  me the power of my own voice.
*  My mother volunteered at the local school.
*  I'm the proud granddaughter of a housekeeper, Sarah Daisy, who raised her three children
*  in a one-bedroom apartment.
*  It was her dream to work in government to help people.
*  My grandmother, the woman who helped raise me as a child, a little old white lady born
*  in a tiny town called Peru, Kansas.
*  I want to talk now about somebody who's not with us tonight.
*  Tessie Prevost Williams was born in New Orleans, not long after the Supreme Court ruled that
*  segregated public schools were unconstitutional.
*  That was in 1954, same year I was born.
*  Parents pulled their kids out of the school.
*  There was a way that I think the candidacy and the person was placed in a long legacy,
*  both about gender identity and racial identity, that kind of teed up this Thursday as a
*  culminating moment, both politically and I think in a broader historical context.
*  Together we put a lot of cracks in the highest, hardest glass ceiling.
*  And you know what?
*  On the other side of that glass ceiling is Kamala Harris raising her hand and taking
*  the oath of office as our 47th president of the United States.
*  I wish my mother and Kamala's mother could see us.
*  They would say, keep going, Shirley and Jerry would say, keep going.
*  I think you can do a lot to set up a candidate to be in a good position.
*  All of this stuff adds up to some part of the puzzle, but the biggest piece is the candidate
*  themselves. At the end of the day, they have to close the deal.
*  And I think this moment is her chance to tell her own story in a way that sometimes she has
*  not decided to. And that's still what this whole convention, success and failure, will ride on.
*  So we're going to watch tonight. We're going to watch with our colleague, Reed Epstein,
*  and you are going to have a great episode of The Run-Up on Friday. We will all be tuning in.
*  Thank you. I appreciate you doing this, Serena. Really. Thanks a lot.
*  Are you a delegate? Oh, yes. Sorry, we caught you mid-French fry eating.
*  What's your feeling about Kamala and kind of what her story has been? Are you getting to
*  know her this week? Are there things you've learned about her this week?
*  Yeah, I'm learning more and more as we go along. The more and more I learn about her, the more I'm
*  impressed with her. I mean, she worked at McDonald's when she was going to college to try to pay her way
*  through. Her very small beginnings, not a trust fund baby type of thing. I relate to that. Like,
*  I was on food stamps this year, you know? So it's like, if she can do it with that background,
*  it gives everybody hope. Hillary was my girl. When Hillary ran, I championed her as well,
*  but I didn't feel this way as I feel about Harris. I'm like, do I want to run for office? If she can
*  do it, she looks just like me, right? She represents, she worked at McDonald's. She paid for every,
*  it's relatable, and that's what everybody needs, so. We're going to break that glass ceiling. I'm
*  getting teary and teary in my eyes, and it just means so much to be inclusive.
*  What does it mean to you that Kamala Harris is a woman? What does it mean to you that she's a black
*  woman? Oh, to have a black woman become the president of the United States and for her to
*  turn the world upside down in 30 days to know that I'm in the midst of this miraculous history
*  is phenomenal. One delegate who really stood out to us was Beverly Hatcher,
*  a 76-year-old black woman from Texas. I was raised by a wonderful Baptist mama.
*  I just lost her, but I am who I am because of my mother. We were always pushed to do whatever
*  we wanted to do. I'll never forget, I wanted to be a majorette. I taught myself because we had no
*  money for what is it called, lessons. And a majorette is like the baton twirler, right? Yes.
*  And when I did finally try out in my 11th grade, I won right off, and my classmates,
*  who were predominantly white, as years have gone by, have told me at class reunions and stuff
*  Beverly, the sleepy town of Wellington, woke up, oh my god, we got a black girl getting ready to
*  be the head majorette. But it happened because I had the drive and the will. My mother and my
*  family stood behind me and didn't miss a parade or a football game or a basketball game. And you see
*  that in Harris? Yeah. Beverly, what would your mom say if she saw this?
*  My sisters have been telling me every day how proud my mom is, and I'm just happy to,
*  I'm happy to make her happy. Yeah, we women who have had mothers like Kamala, like Michelle,
*  I remember Hillary's mother. We women value their strength and their wisdom,
*  and we're just glad that they gave us a legacy to pass it on.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Reed, hello. Hello. Okay. Kamala Harris just wrapped up her acceptance speech. Before we
*  talk about what she said in the case she presented, tell us how her campaign was thinking about the
*  stakes of this moment. You know, Sabrina, this evening was one of two opportunities, along with
*  the debate next month, for her to speak to tens of millions of people at once. And so for that,
*  the stakes were really high. You know, her goal was to present herself as a serious person and
*  a serious candidate who was not the candidate who flamed out in 2019 or the unsteady vice president
*  from the beginning of her term. She had to show that she has the gravitas to be the commander in
*  chief, the political aptitude to reach out to the middle, and also to the progressives in her party
*  all at the same time. So a very tall order. Tell us how she went about doing that.
*  Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Well, she started talking around 930 Chicago time
*  to a packed United Center with 14 or 15,000 people, many, many wearing all white,
*  the color of the suffragettes, a color that makes a statement just by wearing it.
*  And when Harris took the stage,
*  they erupted in a cheer that forced her for a couple minutes to wait before she could start
*  talking. Thank you. Okay, let's get to business. Let's get to business. All right. And what did
*  she finally say when she started talking? You know, she told the story of her life.
*  The path that led me here in recent weeks was no doubt unexpected,
*  but I'm no stranger to unlikely journeys. So
*  my mother, our mother, Shamela Harris, had one of her own, and I miss her every day,
*  and especially right now. She talked about the influence of her mother who raised her and her
*  sister. And she also taught us, and never do anything half-assed. And that is a direct quote.
*  She spoke about her family's humble beginnings in Oakland. Before she could finally afford to buy
*  a home, she rented a small apartment in the East Bay. Then she started talking about her career as
*  a prosecutor. In the courtroom, I stood proudly before a judge, and I said five words. She brought
*  back one of the lines that she used in her 2020 campaign about how when she stood up in a courtroom,
*  she began with the same words. Kamala Harris for the peace of the world.
*  Kamala Harris for the people. And she said she would bring that same philosophy to the White House,
*  that she was not working for specific individuals, but for the people at large.
*  And so on behalf of the people, eventually she did a big wind-up to formally accepting the nomination.
*  On behalf of every American, regardless of party, race, gender, or the language your
*  grandmother speaks. And listed the people on whose behalf she did so. On behalf of everyone
*  whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on earth. It was really a kind of a feat
*  of speech writing to build up to this big emotional moment. I accept your nomination
*  to be president of the United States of America.
*  And what did you make of that? How she was doing that? You know, it was building up this speech to
*  be a serious political document and present her as a serious figure in this moment. And so she
*  still has to prove to people that she is capable of being the commander in chief and running the
*  country. And how does she try to prove that she's capable of that, of being a commander in chief?
*  You know, what she did was try to draw the distinction between herself and Donald Trump.
*  In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man.
*  But the consequences, but the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are
*  extremely serious. And she warns that Trump would not have guardrails on him if he were elected to
*  a second term. Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. And how he would use the immense
*  powers of the presidency of the United States, not to improve your life, not to strengthen our
*  national security, but to serve the only client he has ever had himself.
*  The speech was very clear-eyed about the sakes of the election.
*  They know Trump won't hold autocrats accountable because he wants to be an autocrat himself.
*  There was a whole section in the middle of the speech where she ticked through,
*  you know, one by one, a whole series of warnings about things that Trump would do to the country
*  if he were back in the White House. Get this, he plans to create a national anti-abortion coordinator
*  and force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions.
*  Simply put, they are out of their minds.
*  What else stuck out to you?
*  You know, it was remarkable, the section of the speech where she talked about Gaza.
*  President Biden and I are working around the clock because now is the time to get a hostage deal
*  and a ceasefire deal done. She did not veer too far to the left.
*  I will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself.
*  She managed to say things that would be appealing to both sides.
*  President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are
*  released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to
*  dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination. It was a remarkable moment to hear the arena erupt
*  at the end of that section, to hear her support for both the Israelis and the Palestinians
*  reveal that kind of enthusiasm, you know, after the party has been really
*  ripped apart for months about how to handle the situation.
*  Fellow Americans, I love our country with all my heart.
*  You know, she ended the speech with a pay-on to patriotism.
*  We are the heirs to the greatest democracy in the history of the world.
*  She dove headlong into the American exceptionalism argument that is native to Republicans
*  and to older generations of politicians like Joe Biden.
*  It is now our turn to do what generations before us have done, guided by optimism and faith
*  to fight for this country we love.
*  But it's not something you always hear from younger Democrats
*  who are a little less comfortable with some of the flag waving.
*  Let's vote for it and together let us write the next great chapter in the most extraordinary story
*  ever told. Thank you. God bless you and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you.
*  She seemed to really be taking aim at this criticism of her, which is that she's,
*  you know, this radical California liberal and she can't be trusted with the keys to the country.
*  I mean that was one of the tasks that she had tonight was to make the argument,
*  particularly to voters in the middle, the suburban voters that used to vote for Republicans but
*  have been repelled by Trump and driven to Democrats in the last several years,
*  that they can vote for her without worrying that she's some kind of sort of Bernie Sanders acolyte.
*  You know, and some of that is based on the way she ran her last presidential campaign.
*  Some of it frankly is because she's a black woman from California and that the voters who
*  will determine this election are, you know, voters in less diverse states for the most part.
*  So Reed, stepping back here, you know, it feels worth remembering just where we were
*  at the end of the Republican National Convention that was, you know, just over a month ago.
*  Things couldn't have felt more different. The GOP was on top of the world while the Democrats were
*  in disarray over Biden's refusal to leave the race. And now here we are. And it feels like things
*  couldn't be better for the Democrats. At least that's the feeling I'm having coming out of this
*  convention. I mean, the whole race has turned upside down from where it was when we left
*  Milwaukee. Democrats are upbeat. They are confident. It is a party that is remarkably united
*  behind their candidate. But you have to remember this election will be very close. It is indeed a
*  game of inches in the key battleground states. And what she was trying to do was to present
*  herself as someone who can be trusted as commander in chief to win over the tiny slices of the
*  electorate that will determine the winner in places like Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania,
*  Georgia and Arizona. And those are the states that will determine the election.
*  And they have made a calculated decision that those voters needed to see her as a commander in
*  chief, something they had not seen from her before. And we will see in the coming days and weeks
*  whether she's accomplished that in a way that brings enough of those people on board for her
*  to win a term as president. Reed, thank you. Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. On Thursday, the Supreme Court allowed Arizona
*  Republicans for now to impose tougher voting requirements, including a new rule that people
*  registering to vote there before the coming election must show proof of citizenship. As a result,
*  Arizonans newly registering to vote for this year's presidential election
*  must provide copies of one of several documents, such as a birth certificate or a passport,
*  in order to prove that they are U.S. citizens. Democrats have denounced the new rule as an
*  attempt to prevent legal immigrants from voting. And U.S. health officials have approved the latest
*  slate of annual COVID vaccines, clearing the way for Americans six months and older to receive
*  updated shots in the coming days. The approvals come amid a prolonged surge of COVID infections,
*  which have risen all summer. Remember to catch a new episode of the interview right here tomorrow.
*  This week, Lulu Garcia Navarro talks with Jenna Ortega, the star of the Netflix series Wednesday
*  and the new Beetlejuice sequel, about her head spinning success over the past few years.
*  One day I just, I woke up in somebody else's shoes. I felt like I had entered somebody
*  else's life and like I didn't know how to get back to mine.
