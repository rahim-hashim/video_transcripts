# The Sunday Read: ‘Can Germany Be a Great Military Power Again?’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh11rC4jG2w)
*  My name is James Angelos and I'm a contributing writer to the New York Times magazine.
*  This week's Sunday Read is a story I wrote about Germany and its attempts to build up
*  its military after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
*  When Russia invaded Ukraine last year, the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called it a
*  A turning point.
*  Scholz went on to say that Germany would increase defense spending to more than 2% of its GDP
*  and quickly spend 100 billion euros to bolster the Bundeswehr, Germany's armed forces.
*  It was a tectonic shift for Germany.
*  Germany is Europe's strongest economy, but for long it has spent relatively little on
*  defense and it has an ingrained skepticism of military power.
*  Because of that, the state of Germany's military, to say the least, is deficient.
*  We're talking about soldiers even lacking protective vests and backpacks.
*  During the Cold War, West Germany's approach to the Soviets was to try to keep the peace
*  by building economic relations.
*  The theory was that close economic interdependence would lessen the chances of a nuclear apocalypse.
*  But with the invasion of Ukraine, it became clear for Germany and other NATO members that
*  this theory of interdependence had failed.
*  Since the end of the Cold War, Germany had more or less disarmed.
*  And it's been easy to do that because its defense has been assured by the US.
*  But now, what's at stake is whether Germany could ever defend itself, let alone help defend
*  the rest of Europe.
*  So here's my article, Can Germany Be a Great Military Power Again?
*  Read by Grover Gardner.

*  Under a blazing July sun, Anna Katrine Meister prepared to fire a Heckler and Koch G36, the
*  of the German military or Bundeswehr.
*  Dressed in fatigues, helmet, and bulletproof vest, she crouched about 20 yards from two
*  human silhouettes, stand-ins for a hypothetical threat to the German homeland.
*  Concentration, ordered her instructor, Oliver Meissmans, articulating each syllable.
*  Meissmans, a former tank commander who is now a sergeant in Germany's reserves and an
*  electric guitar teacher by trade, stood with a supportive hand on Meister's back.
*  Don't wiggle around so much, he urged, thumb away from the breech block.
*  Meister, who was 34, works in human resources for a tech company near her home in Lower
*  Saxony, where she serves on the local council as a member of the center-left Social Democratic
*  Party.
*  The closest she had ever come to firing an assault rifle was at a carnival shooting gallery.
*  Now as blasts from adjacent firing areas rang out, Meister took a few breaths to steady
*  herself.
*  She set her rifle's sights to just above the sternum of her fictional enemy, having been
*  instructed by Meissmans to aim higher to account for the gap between the scope and the barrel
*  and pulled the trigger.
*  Shock waves reverberated off the walls of the shooting range and four shells landed
*  in the gravel near her feet.
*  Clouds of sunlit dust rose from the mound of sand behind the target.
*  Now she's awake again, one of the trainers called out with a laugh.
*  Meister had been doing well for a novice, but this time she pulled the trigger too fast
*  between shots resulting in errant fire.
*  In the end, she hit the enemy's chest 16 times.
*  She needed 18 hits to meet the goal set by her instructors.
*  Her short lapse of concentrazione had cost her.
*  A few dozen of Meister's new comrades-in-arms watched from beyond the shooting area.
*  Like Meister, they were civilians with no previous military experience and had come
*  to this military base in Nienberg, a medieval town in Lower Saxony, to train for homeland
*  protection units in the country's reserves.
*  My generation, I always say, is a bit like a generation without war, Meister told me
*  between exercises.
*  Of course there were conflicts, like in Kosovo, but we were still relatively young and we
*  grew up in such a safe, ideal world.
*  But this is now changing.
*  Not everyone in her age group wanted to embrace this change, she conceded.
*  I would say many of them lean in the direction of being pacifists, she said, but you can
*  only be a pacifist if you have this safe, ideal world, and we don't have such a world.
*  Although no one on the base said so explicitly, the threat Meister and her comrades were preparing
*  to counter emanated from Russia.
*  When Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and then instigated a separatist war in Donbas in eastern
*  Ukraine, German military planners began to consider the suddenly not so far-fetched possibility
*  of a large land war in Europe, one that would require German soldiers to defend European
*  territory.
*  During Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year, those fears grew more
*  acute.
*  The German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, told parliament that the attack marked a Zeitendende, a historic
*  turning point for Europe and Germany.
*  There could be no doubt that Putin wanted to build a Russian empire, Scholz said.
*  Parliamentarians must therefore ask, what capabilities do we need in order to counter
*  this threat?
*  He announced, among other measures, a 100 billion euro fund to bolster the German military.
*  The plan, if implemented, would represent the largest absolute jump in German military
*  spending since World War II.
*  Parliamentarians gave Scholz a standing ovation.
*  That level of support would have been almost unthinkable before the invasion.
*  In Germany, skepticism of the merits of military strength has enabled a long post-Cold War
*  process of disarmament.
*  As a result, Germany is a historic anomaly in the heart of Europe, an economic leviathan
*  minnow.
*  Now German leaders are vowing to transform the country into a military power capable
*  of taking responsibility for Europe's security.
*  The question is whether they, and a hesitant German society, can follow through on this
*  promise.
*  Across much of the world, soldierliness is considered a virtue and fighting for one's
*  country a natural way to serve it.
*  So in Germany, where the use of military power often raises uncomfortable associations with
*  the country's Nazi past, the fact that German soldiers have repeatedly been implicated in
*  high-profile cases of right-wing extremism has not helped ease this discomfort.
*  In recent years, such cases of extremism have been particularly prevalent among commandos
*  in the German army's special forces, the Kommando Spezialkräfte, or KSK.
*  In December, members of Citizens of the Reich, a fringe group of conspiracy theorists, were
*  accused of planning a bizarre, if potentially violent, coup to overthrow the government
*  and install a prince.
*  Several former Bundeswehr soldiers and one active member were among the alleged plotters.
*  Russian propagandists were clearly trying to hit a nerve when they responded to Germany's
*  current plans by suggesting that the country was returning to Nazism.
*  How could this end, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria V. Zakharova, said in June?
*  Alas, this is well known from history.
*  This was a far-fetched line of attack.
*  Despite a radical right minority, Germany is largely defined by its aversion to extreme
*  nationalism and militarism.
*  But it was also a familiar one.
*  When the Bundeswehr was created in 1955, largely in response to American and British concerns
*  about a potential Soviet invasion of West Germany, its officer corps consisted almost
*  entirely of old Wehrmacht officers, including former SS men.
*  Soviet leaders at the time portrayed the rebirth of the German military as fascist revanchism
*  and the return of Hitlerism.
*  Resistance to rearmament also came from a substantial swath of the war-weary West German
*  population, fearful, as many are now, that it would provoke the Russians.
*  The Bundeswehr nonetheless grew, with the help of conscription, to include nearly 500,000
*  soldiers, becoming one of the largest militaries in the NATO alliance during the Cold War.
*  It was the Russian threat that led to the resurrection of the German military during
*  the Cold War.
*  It's once again the Russian threat that may lead to its revitalization.
*  The German officer and her fellow trainees see joining the reserves as their democratic
*  duty, and the officer running the training program in Nienberg told me that interest
*  in the reserves rose sharply in the days following Russia's invasion.
*  But many Germans don't share that enthusiasm, and the war has not led to a boom in recruitment
*  for the Bundeswehr as a whole.
*  Still, there are signs that a historic shift, the growing acceptance of the need to wield
*  military power, is taking root in Germany.
*  On the base that day was Frank Oesterhelweg, a member of the conservative Christian Democratic
*  Union and then Vice President of the Lower Saxony State Parliament.
*  Oesterhelweg, who wore a pin of the Ukrainian and German flags on his lapel, has long advocated
*  for a more robust German defense.
*  Now, he said, people were finally coming around to his point of view.
*  What we've had was really almost a pacifist attitude whereby some have said, do we actually
*  need the Bundeswehr?
*  He said.
*  There are also a lot of people who would no longer be willing to pick up a weapon at all.
*  I believe that the invasion on February 24th and what we have experienced since show that
*  it is not so simple after all.
*  He added, I believe a lot is now changing in the population.
*  We have come back to reality.
*  On September 12th, Christina Lombrecht, Germany's defense minister at the time, addressed the
*  German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin and declared that Germany must be willing
*  to become a Führungsmarkt or leading power within Europe.
*  She acknowledged that this might seem alien to Germans, but that this uneasiness obscures
*  something quite essential, namely that Germany de facto leads even when it does not want
*  to.
*  Located at the center of the block and with the European Union's biggest economy and
*  population, Germany has an inescapable influence on Europe's stability and security, even as
*  it has often tried to avoid the role.
*  Scholars have referred to Germany as a reluctant hegemon and point to what they call a leadership
*  avoidance complex.
*  While this reluctance has a great deal to do with Germany's Nazi past, it would be
*  naive to think that this entirely explains it.
*  Germany has long occupied an exceptionally comfortable place in the world.
*  It has an export-dependent economy, selling its cars and machines far and wide, and many
*  tanks and submarines, as one of the world's largest arms exporters.
*  But when it comes to countering perceived security threats, whether the Islamic State
*  or Putin, it has allowed allies to take the lead.
*  German leaders sent troops to Afghanistan, but largely avoided referring to it as a war,
*  even as German soldiers engaged in ground combat there, for the first time since World
*  War II.
*  Germany's aversion to military power has been sustained by one glaring fact.
*  is guaranteed by the world's preeminent superpower, the United States, within the framework of
*  NATO.
*  President Donald Trump, who tended to reduce foreign policy to questions of who was ripping
*  off whom, was particularly obsessed with what he saw as German defense freeloading, calling
*  Germany delinquent on military spending.
*  But it wasn't just Trump.
*  Every recent US administration tried, and mostly failed, to get the Germans and other
*  European allies to strengthen their militaries and meet the NATO defense spending target
*  of 2% of gross domestic product, a goal Germany has long undershot.
*  Even as Putin's rhetoric and actions became increasingly bellicose, a mantra of Wandel
*  der Handel, or change through trade, continued to define Germany's foreign policy toward
*  Russia.
*  Economic interdependence with Russia, the thinking went, would encourage Russian democratization,
*  or at the very least a rules-based international order that precluded acts of aggression.
*  It was also good for business.
*  By 2015, Putin's imperial ambitions were becoming increasingly clear.
*  Yet German officials backed the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would bring Russian natural
*  gas to Germany directly through the Baltic Sea, bypassing existing pipelines in Ukraine.
*  Nord Stream 1, running the same route, opened in 2011.
*  The Germans pursued the project despite warnings from US lawmakers, who feared that German
*  dependence on Russian gas gave Putin leverage.
*  Those lawmakers, along with leaders of Eastern European countries who were increasingly alarmed
*  by Putin's aggression, also worried that the new pipeline would compromise Ukraine's
*  security, isolating it and depriving it of lucrative transit fees for transporting gas
*  from Russia to Europe.
*  Revenue from German fossil fuel purchases helped the Kremlin finance a military expansion.
*  At the same time, German military spending as a portion of GDP remained near a post-World
*  War II low.
*  Leaders of Eastern European countries like Poland and Ukraine, which have endured the
*  great geographic misfortune of being sandwiched between Germany and Russia and suffered immensely
*  under both Hitler and Stalin, grew exasperated with Germany's approach to Russia.
*  Even as far back as 2006, Poland's then defense minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, likened plans
*  to build the first Nord Stream pipeline to the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the non-aggression
*  agreement between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union that divided Eastern Europe into spheres
*  of influence.
*  Poland has a particular sensitivity to corridors and deals above our head, Sikorski said at
*  a security conference in Brussels.
*  That was the 20th century.
*  We don't want any repetition of that.
*  As far as Germany was concerned, history had shown that soft power accommodation was more
*  effective than hard power intimidation.
*  Vandal der Handel was in many ways an extension of West Germany's Cold War Ostpolitik, a policy
*  of rapprochement with Russia put in place by the social democratic government at the
*  end of the 1960s amid fears of nuclear war.
*  Though West Germany then maintained a robust military to deter a Soviet invasion, West
*  German leaders came to believe that economic interdependence was crucial to preventing
*  an apocalypse.
*  In a now familiar pattern, pipelines were built to bring Soviet natural gas to Germany.
*  Over the years, American presidents expressed concern that Germany was becoming too dependent
*  on the Soviets and providing revenue for their military.
*  But in Germany, Ostpolitik was seen, especially on the political left, as instrumental in
*  ending the Cold War.
*  When Russia invaded Ukraine in February, the failings of German policy became clear even
*  to Germans.
*  Germany's army consisted of an aging force of about 183,000 troops.
*  German soldiers lacked not only heavy weapons and ammunition, but also basics like protective
*  vests, helmets, and backpacks.
*  On the day of the invasion, Lieutenant General Alfons Meis, the head of the German army,
*  one of three branches of the Bundeswehr, used his LinkedIn page to broadcast his frustration.
*  The army that I am privileged to lead is more or less bare, Meis wrote.
*  This does not feel good.
*  In April, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a social democrat who served as foreign minister
*  under Angela Merkel and was an architect of Germany's Russia policy, admitted to mistakes.
*  We held onto bridges that Russia no longer believed in and that our partners warned us
*  he told journalists in Berlin.
*  We failed at building a common European house that includes Russia.
*  Few countries have been as fundamentally shaken by the Russian invasion as Germany.
*  Soaring energy costs are undermining German industries.
*  Wandel der Handel has been discredited, calling into question not only Germany's past Russia
*  policy, but also its current relationship with an autocratic China, Germany's largest
*  trading partner, at a time when President Xi Jinping is consolidating power and China
*  is building up its armed forces and threatening military action against Taiwan.
*  Germany's leaders are now frantically seeking new energy sources and arguing for the necessity
*  of hard power.
*  As part of his Zeitungwende speech, Schultz vowed to meet the NATO defense spending target
*  from now on, though his government has since been non-committal about when that might happen.
*  In part, this is because of the entrenched bureaucracy that makes the process of spending
*  money on arms glacially slow.
*  Should German leaders deliver on their promises, Germany would become the third or fourth biggest
*  military spender in the world.
*  Before the war, such an increase would have been highly unpopular.
*  But in a poll conducted for German public television soon after the invasion, 69% of
*  Germans supported it.
*  One day in June, I spoke with Germany's top-ranking military general, Chief of Defense Eberhard
*  Zorn, at the Defense Ministry in Berlin.
*  Military leaders in the United States often project a certain swagger with generals assigned
*  nicknames like Mad Dog or Stormin Norman.
*  That's not so much the case in Germany's Bundeswehr.
*  Wearing thin-framed glasses and short-sleeved service shirt, Zorn had the manner of a friendly
*  corporate manager.
*  In a conference room with a map of Ukraine stuck to the wall above the copier, I asked
*  him if he believed Germans were embracing the idea that the country needs a capable
*  military.
*  I think it's coming back now, he told me.
*  Even parties that were not necessarily always behind the Bundeswehr per se, even there,
*  Realpolitik is now on the table, where people say we need the armed forces.
*  Much of the current period reminded him of his service during the Cold War, he said,
*  particularly during the early 1980s, when the arms race was heating up and the threat
*  of nuclear war still loomed.
*  The questions in the population are similar, Zorn told me.
*  What's the threat situation, he said, and what happens if deterrence doesn't work?
*  He went on, all of that is coming back again.
*  The day of the Bundeswehr is a bit like the German military's Woodstock.
*  Filled as a look behind the scenes, it was founded in 2015 to sell the idea of the military
*  to the German people and, though not explicitly, to win new recruits.
*  Germany's defense ministry has plans to expand its force by roughly 20,000 soldiers.
*  This will be difficult.
*  In 2021, 17.5% of military posts above the level of enlisted ranks were vacant.
*  The previous year, fewer than half of the 220 posts for jet pilots in the Air Force
*  were occupied.
*  Conscription in Germany, a relic of the Cold War, was suspended in 2011, so the Bundeswehr
*  has little choice but to make military service seem exciting.
*  This year, the event occurred on a nearly cloudless Saturday in June in Warrendorf,
*  a town in western Germany.
*  When I arrived, a rock band in military uniform was playing a cover of Pink Floyd's Another
*  Brick in the Wall before a sparse crowd.
*  We don't need no education.
*  We don't need no thought control, droned the singer with a slight German accent.
*  Beyond the stage, there was an array of German military equipment, an armored infantry fighting
*  vehicle, an armored reconnaissance vehicle, decontamination equipment.
*  Above it all fluttered Germany's tri-color flag with the Federal Code of Arms, a black
*  open-winged eagle.
*  I walked over to a tent belonging to the Zentrum Innerer Führung, a civic education center
*  in the Bundeswehr that teaches soldiers the concept of inner leadership.
*  That concept, which dates to the founding of the Bundeswehr, is the ethical bedrock
*  of today's force.
*  Soldiers should be led not by a furor but by their own moral compass.
*  They can refuse orders that violate higher principles.
*  Though the concept was intended to mark a clear break with the Nazi past, the men who
*  conceived it served in the Wehrmacht.
*  Many went on to perpetuate the myth of a clean Wehrmacht, the false narrative that the force
*  was innocent of Nazi crimes that held sway through much of the twentieth century and
*  is sustained today by the radical right.
*  In the tent, a soldier in fatigues posed a series of questions about inner leadership
*  to a group of civilians, who tapped answers into their phones and then watched the results
*  on a screen.
*  Which of the following terms represents not a universal value but a virtue, the soldier
*  asked.
*  A boy in a camouflage cap looked up at his mother who was struggling to choose among
*  the options, bravery, freedom, human dignity, and peace.
*  Of the participants, 67% chose human dignity, which was wrong.
*  The correct answer was bravery.
*  Participants received Bundeswehr tote bags and other swag.
*  Sitting outside the tent under a canopy, I found Major General Andre Bodeman, who was
*  the commander of the Zentrum Innerer Führung.
*  As the band played Neil Diamond's Sweet Caroline, Bodeman told me that the purpose of the center
*  is to inculcate soldiers with values rooted in Germany's democratic society.
*  In the end, soldiers risk their own lives or the lives of others or have to kill, Bodeman
*  told me, they have to know what they're doing it for.
*  Of course, things don't always go according to plan.
*  During 2021, 1452 cases of suspected extremism were investigated in the Bundeswehr, a vast
*  majority of a right-wing variety.
*  In one case, several soldiers in one platoon of a mechanized infantry training battalion
*  that was part of a German-led NATO battle group in Lithuania, sang a happy birthday
*  song for Adolf Hitler.
*  When this and other incidents were investigated, one soldier posted a photo of a Wehrmacht
*  soldier on social media with a finger over his mouth and the caption, silence, don't
*  blab, the enemy is listening.
*  The Bundeswehr's leaders have said that they have a zero tolerance policy for extremism
*  and that these cases don't represent a systemic problem within the ranks.
*  But for the Bundeswehr, they are a profound existential threat, undermining the idea
*  that the modern military represents a clean break from the Nazi past.
*  Germany is of course far from the only nation to attract extremists to its military, but
*  in a country so averse to any semblance of militarism, it is perhaps not surprising that
*  some of those drawn to combat would have views out of sync with the mainstream.
*  This was certainly the case inside one company in Germany's elite commando force, the KSK.
*  In 2020, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, then the defense minister, disbanded the company,
*  following a series of right-wing extremist incidents, including one in which soldiers
*  were accused of giving each other Hitler salutes at a party.
*  The KSK was then put through a series of reforms, and KSK commandos were required to take courses
*  at the Zentrum Interferung on subjects like character development and loyalty to the Constitution.
*  In December, the KSK again came under scrutiny when police searched a KSK barracks and detained
*  a master sergeant working in logistics who was suspected of taking part in the alleged
*  coup planned by an organization affiliated with citizens of the Reich.
*  German media reported that two other soldiers, previously associated with the KSK, including
*  an ex-colonel, were also part of the military branch of the organization.
*  The plotters with known KSK connections were in their 50s and 60s, according to German
*  media reports, and German officials say they don't reflect the future of the force or
*  the effectiveness of current reforms.
*  But the scandals haven't helped with recruitment of new commandos.
*  Many KSK posts are currently unfilled, according to a confidential defense ministry document
*  obtained by the German media in June.
*  The force is, of course, keen to change this.
*  Shortly after I spoke to Bodemann, a uniformed MC took the stage and played a short video
*  on the KSK.
*  As soaring music played, soldiers in tactical gear pointed guns at the camera, ran through
*  woodlands and trudged through snow-covered hills.
*  Well, there's something to talk about, the MC said when the video ended.
*  We then introduced a KSK soldier of two decades named Andi, a wiry man in fatigues who told
*  the crowd that he was responsible for personnel regeneration.
*  Andi gave a short sales pitch that excluded any mention of the force's recent troubles.
*  We travel all over the world, to the Arizona desert for parachuting, to the Arctic, training
*  and all these vehicles with these special features.
*  You can see them at our tent.
*  After Andi spoke, people gathered to hear Lombrecht, Germany's defense minister, say
*  a few words.
*  She took the stage to a smattering of applause and praised the soldier's creativity in dealing
*  in recent years with tight financial margins.
*  The last few months had provided a painful lesson, she said.
*  If we want to continue to live in this free and secure situation, we must also be prepared
*  to militarily defend these values that we stand for.
*  Six months later, on January 16th, Lombrecht resigned.
*  She had come under fierce criticism from Germany's conservative opposition for failing to bolster
*  Germany's military fast enough and for a series of embarrassing public missteps.
*  Early in her tenure, Lombrecht, just weeks before Russia's February 24th invasion of
*  Ukraine, announced that Germany would send Ukrainians 5,000 helmets.
*  It's a clear signal, we are on your side, she said.
*  She was widely derided.
*  Speaking to the German tabloid Bildt, the mayor of Kiev, Vitaly Klitschko, called the
*  contribution an absolute joke.
*  The day after Lombrecht's resignation, Schultz announced that Boris Pistorius, a social democratic
*  politician who served as the interior minister of Lower Saxony but who has little foreign
*  policy experience, would be the new defense minister.
*  I made my way around the exhibits.
*  Near one called Life in the Field, amid tents and faux campfires, a soldier slung a helmet
*  and a bulletproof vest over the small frame of a young boy dressed in military fatigues.
*  The boy's father snapped photos.
*  I'm more of a pacifist, he told me when I caught up with him.
*  The man, Franck, who preferred not to give his full name to protect his son's privacy,
*  told me that his son, a seven-year-old named Zamuel, went through role-playing phases.
*  Zamuel, his father said, had been particularly affected by the invasion of Ukraine because
*  they had family friends who were Ukrainian.
*  Franck thought this might have created a certain psychological need to be strong.
*  I met several parents dragged to the event by their children who wanted to look at the
*  equipment.
*  Recruiters also gave guided tours to young people interested in applying to join the
*  force, an event referred to as Talent Scout, and billed as an exclusive VIP experience.
*  Teenagers I spoke to had seen Bundeswehr videos on TikTok or followed the Bundeswehr's YouTube
*  channel where the often humdrum life of a soldier is made to seem maximally cool.
*  One such prospective soldier was Leonardo Preuss, an amiable kid one week from his 15th
*  birthday.
*  Slung over his shoulder was a drawstring Bundeswehr backpack filled with military swag and emblazoned
*  with the phrase, On the way to my strengths.
*  Preuss told me he aspired to be a KSK soldier and was excited to visit the KSK tent.
*  I asked Preuss what his friends made of his ambition.
*  At school it's not like kids are saying, Oh, he wants to join the Bundeswehr, he's not
*  really my type.
*  Rather you hear, Oh, that's pretty cool.
*  I asked him if he knew about the right-wing extremist scandals in the KSK.
*  He recalled hearing something, but this didn't deter him.
*  I won't become a right-wing extremist or anything like that, he said.
*  I think Hitler sucks.
*  I say it like it is.
*  Before Preuss left, he showed me a poster he received from the KSK tent.
*  It featured an image of soldiers just dropped from a helicopter with the KSK motto, Der
*  Wille entscheidet, or the will decides.
*  It's definitely going above my bed, he said.
*  In Germany and Europe generally, resistance to new get tough on Russia policies is particularly
*  evident on the political fringes where elements of anti-US, anti-NATO and pro-Russia sentiment
*  prevail.
*  Members of the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AFD, have long advocated for a stronger
*  military, but their sympathy for Putin, the man right-wing radicals across the globe regard
*  as the keeper of traditional values in the face of decadent liberalism, means they don't
*  want to use the military to antagonize the Kremlin.
*  The far left, on the other hand, is against militarization and favors diverting defense
*  towards social spending.
*  Yet its historic affinity with Russia and its abhorrence of perceived American imperialism
*  means the far left has sometimes seemed to make Putin's points for him.
*  This dynamic was on display on a July afternoon in Berlin when hundreds of people, many belonging
*  to far-left parties and pacifist groups, assembled on Babelplatz, a square in the center of Berlin
*  that was the site of one of the first mass book burnings of the Nazi era.
*  Many in the crowd waved socialist-red flags, some adorned with a hammer and sickle.
*  A small band led by an older man in red pants played a German-language version of an anti-fascist
*  Woody Guthrie song composed in 1942.
*  All you fascists bound to lose, the man sang.
*  One woman in the crowd had draped herself with a rainbow flag that said no to NATO.
*  She told me she was a member of the German Communist Party, a marginal faction that Germany's
*  domestic intelligence deems extremist.
*  She gave me a quick revisionist history lesson about the West's post-Cold War relations with
*  Russia, before concluding, the USA is the main aggressor.
*  As if on cue, the curly-haired, bespectacled chairman of her party, Patrick Kübler, appeared
*  on a makeshift stage to denounce Germany's military plans and NATO's aggressive war alliance
*  of imperialism.
*  He then declared, away with the armament program and great power ambitions of Germany.
*  Not everyone at the protest, however, seemed to be an acolyte of the hard left, one group
*  with no overt party affiliation simply carried a banner that said friendship in Russian.
*  One woman in the group told me she didn't want to share her views with a member of the
*  press because she would most likely be depicted as a Nazi.
*  Members of a leftist organization later reported abandoning the demonstration after confronting
*  what they called groups with right-wing and conspiratorial views.
*  This would not be surprising in such a setting.
*  Extremists on both ends of the political spectrum embrace conspiracy theories that act as a
*  kind of ideological glue.
*  The German far right has been trying to exploit this crossover, hoping to form a querfront,
*  or lateral front, to recruit new members.
*  The political extremes are also targets of Russian disinformation.
*  A Reuters investigation published in January found pro-Putin operatives operating inside
*  far-right and fringe groups in an effort to spread Kremlin narratives.
*  As the demonstrators took off for a march toward the Brandenburg Gate, a disconcerting
*  scene unfolded in front of the Russian embassy, where a small group had assembled to protest
*  the invasion of Ukraine.
*  Heavy weapons for Ukraine, one of the protesters, a woman draped in the Ukrainian national flag,
*  shouted in the direction of the anti-armament demonstrators.
*  Build peace without weapons, some of the anti-armament demonstrators chanted in return.
*  Heated arguments broke out.
*  The police, who had anticipated the conflict, stood between the factions.
*  One Ukrainian protester, a 39-year-old yoga instructor named Yulia Stepanchenko, was completely
*  befuddled by the German demonstrators.
*  She told me that the eastern Ukrainian town she grew up in was occupied by Russian soldiers
*  at the beginning of the invasion.
*  They say make friendship with people that come to kill you, she added, her voice breaking
*  with emotion.
*  I don't know what's in their heads.
*  Just saying peace doesn't solve problems.
*  Many Germans, not just dedicated pacifists, remain unaware of how frustrated many Ukrainians
*  are with German policies and how much they perceive those policies as having enabled
*  the current invasion.
*  Germany's government has tried to make amends by sending weapons to Ukraine, breaking with
*  a past practice of not delivering arms to conflict zones.
*  Earlier this month, Germany pledged 40 infantry fighting vehicles and a Patriot missile battery
*  that will bolster Ukrainian air defenses.
*  But Ukrainians remain dissatisfied with the pace and extent of German weapons deliveries.
*  Mostly the Ukrainians want Germany to deliver German-made Leopard 2 battle tanks that could
*  be decisive on the battlefield, or at least to allow other countries to do so.
*  Members of several European governments say they are willing to send their own Leopard
*  2 tanks, but because of re-export rules they need Germany's approval.
*  In mid-January, German officials said they would not give that approval unless the United
*  States also agreed to send American-made tanks, but no deal had been reached.
*  There remains widespread reluctance in Germany to the countries assuming a greater role in
*  In a survey conducted for the Kürbü Foundation in August, 52% of Germans said the country
*  should continue practicing restraint in international crises, and 68% rejected the notion that Germany
*  should become a leading military power in Europe.
*  There's also a reflexive aversion among many Germans to the idea of German tanks being
*  Russians, given that Nazi Germany unleashed unfathomable suffering when it invaded the
*  Soviet Union in 1941.
*  By contrast, fewer Germans understand the scale of suffering Ukrainians endured during
*  the Nazi occupation of Soviet Ukraine, or the degree to which its conquest and colonization
*  was central to Hitler's war aims.
*  About 6.5 million people in Ukraine were murdered or died as a result of German killing
*  policies or as a direct or indirect consequence of the war, according to the historian Timothy
*  Snyder.
*  To an extent, pacifism has served as a kind of bomb for many Germans, who, given the extent
*  of German crimes under Nazism, see no other moral way forward.
*  But much debate, on the political left but also within various social institutions, now
*  centers on whether the correct moral stance is to abandon that pacifist tradition.
*  At the end of April, a group of 28 well-known intellectuals and artists published an open
*  letter to the German Chancellor, asking him to refrain from sending heavy weapons to Ukraine,
*  to prevent drawing Germany into a world war, and to limit the human suffering of the Ukrainians.
*  Even justified resistance to an aggressor can at some point become unbearably disproportionate,
*  the letter said.
*  The escalating arms buildup taking place under pressure could be the beginning of a global
*  arms spiral with catastrophic consequences.
*  All this, the letter went on, should be considered in view of Germany's historical responsibility.
*  The letter was widely criticized, including by members of the Green Party, which has roots
*  in Germany's Cold War peace and disarmament movements, but whose leaders are now among
*  the most vocal supporters of sending arms to Ukraine.
*  A foreign policy guided by human rights should constantly ask itself how we can help liberate
*  even more villages and thus save lives through further deliveries, Annalena Baerbach, Germany's
*  foreign minister and a prominent Green Party politician, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine
*  Zeitung in September.
*  At the same time, it's hard to deny that a global arms spiral, accelerated by the Russian
*  invasion, is already happening.
*  Japan, seeing threats from North Korea and China, is abandoning its post-war pacifism,
*  vowing to double its military spending.
*  That both Germany and Japan, two former World War II Axis powers, are now remilitarizing,
*  illustrates the degree to which the world may be reverting to great power rivalry, with
*  unpredictable consequences.
*  One of Germany's main military training areas sits on a vast expanse of heath and woodlands
*  south of Hamburg.
*  One morning in September, I stood atop a concrete bunker and looked out over a sandy, shrub-covered
*  plain.
*  The groan of several approaching tanks, which had started their advance about 3,000 yards
*  to the east, was growing louder.
*  I scanned at the landscape but still couldn't see the tanks, which made the sound of their
*  roaring engines more menacing.
*  To the west, a few tanks lay hidden.
*  The goal of the attacking tanks was to eliminate them.
*  Finally, several of the most advanced battle tanks in Germany's arsenal, the Leopard II
*  A7V, emerged from the tree lines of the German army.
*  The Leopard II A7V emerged from the tree line into the open, and blazoned with the iron
*  cross, the 64-ton vehicles kicked up clouds of dust as they roared past the bunker and
*  disappeared into a recess, which was strewn with non-working anti-tank mines.
*  The clamor of a tank battle commenced, but really it was more a game of laser tag, a
*  simulation involving blanks.
*  As the defenders mounted a counterattack from their northern flank, the attacking tanks
*  went into reverse, setting off smoke grenades to obscure their hasty retreat.
*  The tanks that were hit flashed a white light to indicate they were disabled.
*  The battle was over in about 10 minutes.
*  Trainers for each group of tanks assembled to meet with the captain overseeing the exercise.
*  One trainer was particularly disappointed.
*  His group had lost three of its tanks.
*  It's not about winning or losing, the captain admonished him.
*  It was about the men knowing how to respond in certain situations.
*  The tank operators were part of Germany's 393rd Tank Battalion, based in the eastern
*  state Thuringia.
*  They were training to take part in NATO's Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, a rotating
*  multinational force which must be able to deploy within a few days.
*  Conceived in 2014, following the annexation of Crimea, it is considered the spearhead
*  of the larger NATO Response Force and has a rotating leadership.
*  This year German forces are in charge.
*  In June there will be additional forces at the ready.
*  In June, NATO heads of state met in Madrid and agreed to a large increase in the NATO
*  Response Force to around 300,000 from 40,000.
*  Germany's Defense Ministry said it would make available a division of up to 15,000
*  soldiers along with some 65 aircraft and 20 ships.
*  Taking on these NATO roles is a challenge for German forces.
*  In the past, Germany has had difficulty scraping together the equipment and weapons it needs
*  to take part in NATO missions.
*  In the event of actual war, military experts say Germany has enough munitions for maybe
*  two days of fighting.
*  In December, all 18 armored infantry vehicles involved in a live fire exercise broke down.
*  Casting doubt on the very high readiness of the infantry forces using them.
*  The vehicles, called Pumas, were supposed to be state of the art.
*  Germany, according to the Defense Ministry, will instead have to rely on older vehicles
*  used during the Cold War.
*  In January, German public television reported that military leaders in a confidential paper
*  assessed the operational readiness of their spearhead forces as limited because of deficits
*  in air defenses and communications technology.
*  There's also an issue of basic fighting knowledge.
*  Germany's military hasn't done a great deal of training in this kind of conventional warfare,
*  defense of a large swath of territory, since the end of the Cold War, or at least not on
*  this scale.
*  A lot of practical knowledge had been lost, Captain Reynso de Leo, a public affairs officer,
*  told me after the tank exercise.
*  Now we have to go back and look at some of the old manuals.
*  There were many more exercises that day.
*  In a nearby pine forest that afternoon, a series of Pumas sped down a dirt road carrying
*  members of Germany's 112th Mechanized Infantry Battalion.
*  The 112 is in many ways a carryover of the Cold War.
*  It has been stationed near the Czech border, close to the former frontier with the Soviet
*  bloc since 1960.
*  Now its soldiers were also preparing to take part in NATO's High Readiness Force.
*  Their goal on this day was to take control of an intersection strewn with fake mines
*  and defended by an enemy platoon.
*  The Pumas halted and troops with green painted faces emerged from the vehicles carrying rifles
*  and rocket propelled grenade launchers.
*  They quickly scattered into the forest.
*  As they moved toward the enemy, an intense firefight began, albeit with blanks.
*  Shouts of, enemy shooter destroyed, rang out as the soldiers pressed closer to their target.
*  Moments of confusion approximated the fog of war.
*  We're too deep into the wilderness, shouted the deputy platoon leader, ordering his troops
*  to cut right through the woods and hug the road.
*  After the exercise, members of a platoon, sweaty and out of breath, stood around in
*  a semicircle to assess their performance.
*  The platoon leader, a master sergeant named Josef, he declined to give his full name in
*  accordance with military rules for rank and file soldiers, told me that some of the older
*  soldiers had been in Afghanistan where German troops played a stabilization role.
*  But this was a much larger kind of fight.
*  This is war that we're preparing for, he said.
