*  I'm Dan Brooks and I'm a contributor to the New York Times magazine.
*  This week's Sunday read is a story I wrote for the magazine about Monoskein.
*  They're a band of four very good-looking Italians in their early 20s who play
*  throwback hard rock music.
*  They sound like a lot of bands from the post-emo era.
*  It's this super competent execution of familiar elements and structures that evoke
*  2000's rock, with what I call an unswung boogie rhythm.
*  So a boogie rhythm is eighth notes but swung.
*  And bands like Franz Ferdinand, The Strokes, they often use boogie rhythms but not swung,
*  played in clean time.
*  Monoskein's tracks like I want to be your slave.
*  And the Eurovision winning Ziti Ibloni are hugely popular in continental Europe.
*  They're the biggest international music stars from Italy since Luciano Pavarotti and
*  they got there by busking on the streets as teenagers and then going on to win a series
*  of talent shows.
*  Last month they kicked off a big multi-venue tour of the United States with a sold-out
*  show at Madison Square Garden.
*  And what's interesting about this band is that their core fan base is not closely connected
*  to the American critical establishment, at all.
*  In fact, critics kind of hate Monoskein.
*  I first heard of Monoskein through a scathing review of their most recent album, Rush,
*  on Pitchfork.
*  The article went viral after giving the record a score of 2.0 out of 10 and holding up
*  the band as an example of many generally bad trends in music.
*  The use of multi-band compression, the predictable song structures, these sometimes actively
*  stupid lyrics.
*  So when I looked them up, I was astonished to see how popular they are.
*  They currently claim 8 billion streams across various platforms.
*  As a Gen Xer who grew up in an indie rock versus mainstream rock dichotomy, I was sort of
*  like, well, this is mainstream rock.
*  But then I realized there's not really any such thing as mainstream rock anymore.
*  The last number one rock single was Nickelbacks How You Remind Me in 2001, which makes Gen Z the
*  first generation in about 70 years that has not experienced rock and roll as a form of
*  pop music.
*  Instead, Monoskein is making pop music that takes the form of rock, and that's why I was
*  so interested in writing about them.
*  So I flew out to Rome during a heat wave, and I spent many hours with Monoskein and their
*  impressively large management team.
*  I saw their sold-out shows at the Stadio Olympico in Rome, and the Stadio Giuseppe Miazza
*  in Milan.
*  On stage, they put on these wildly theatrical, carefully engineered performances filled with
*  pyro and erratic spotlights, all of it emphasizing the return of the big Stadio
*  rock show.
*  One of the values of that performance is to call attention to the artificial or perform
*  nature of it all.
*  Monoskein wants you to remember that you're watching a show, and it's very much a zero
*  irony presentation.
*  So here's my article, Is Monoskein the Last Rock Band?
*  Read by James Patrick Cronin.
*  The American visitor to Rome arrives with certain preconceptions that feel like stereotypes,
*  but turn out to be basically accurate.
*  There really are mopedes flying around everywhere, and traffic seems governed by the principle
*  that anyone can be replaced.
*  Breakfast is coffee and cigarettes.
*  Despite these orthopedic and nutritional hazards, everyone is better looking, not literally
*  everyone, of course, but statistically, as if whatever selective forces that emerge from
*  urban density have had an extra hundred generations or so to work.
*  And they really do talk like that, an emphatic mix of vowels, gestures, and car horns
*  known as Italian.
*  To be scolded in this language by a driver who wants to park in the crosswalk is to realize
*  that some popular ideas are actually true.
*  Also, it is hot.
*  The traffic return to Rome of Monoskein, arguably the only rock stars of their generation,
*  and almost certainly the biggest Italian rock band of all time, coincided with the heat
*  wave across southern Europe.
*  On that Tuesday in July, the temperature hit 107 degrees.
*  The tieber looked thick, rippled in places, and still in others as if it were reducing.
*  By Thursday morning, the band's vast management team was officially concerned that the night's
*  sold-out performance at the Stadio Olympico would be delayed.
*  When Monoskein finally took the stage around 9.30pm, it was still well into the 90s, which
*  was too bad because there would be pyro.
*  There was no opening act, possibly because no rock band operating at this level is within
*  10 years of Monoskein's age.
*  The guitarist, Thomas Ragi, played the riff to Don't Want to Sleep.
*  The lights came up, and 60,000 Italians screamed.
*  Damiano Dovid, the band's singer and at age 24 its oldest member, charged out in black
*  flared trousers and a mesh top that bisected his torso diagonally.
*  His heavy brow and hyper-symmetrical features making him look like some futuristic nomad
*  who hunted the fishnet mammoth.
*  Victoria Dionjolas, the bassist, wore a mini dress made from strips of leather or possibly
*  bungee cords.
*  Ragi wore non-porous pants and a black button down he quickly discarded, while Ethentorchio
*  drummed in a vest with no shirt underneath his hair flying.
*  For the next several minutes of alternately disciplined and frenzied noise, they sounded
*  as if Motley Crew had been cryogenically frozen, then revived in 2010 with Rob Thomas
*  on vocals.
*  That hypothetical will appeal to some while repelling others, and which category you fall
*  into is, with all to respect, not my business here.
*  Rolling Stone, for its part, said that Monoskein only managed to confirm how hard rock and
*  roll has to work these days to be noticed, and a viral pitchfork review called their
*  most recent album, absolutely terrible at every conceivable level.
*  But this kind of thumbs up, thumbs down criticism is pretty much vestigial now that music is
*  free.
*  If you want to know whether you like Monoskein, the name is Danish.
*  You can fire up the internet and add to the more than 9 billion streams Sony Music claims
*  the band has accumulated across Spotify, YouTube, etc.
*  As for whether Monoskein is good, the Gustavus known as Disputatum, as previous Italians once
*  said, in matters of taste, there can be no arguments.
*  You should know though that even though their music has been heard most often through phone
*  and laptop speakers, Monoskein sounds better on a soccer field.
*  That is what tens of thousands of fans came to the studio Olympico on an eyelid scorching
*  Thursday to experience, the culturally, if not personally familiar commodity of a stadium
*  rock show, delivered by the unprecedented phenomenon of a stadium level Italian rock band.
*  The pyro, 20-foot jets of swivel articulated flame that you could feel all the way up in
*  the mezzanine, kicked in on gasoline, a song Monoskein wrote to protest Vladimir Putin's
*  invasion of Ukraine.
*  From a thrust platform in the center of the field, Davide poured his full emotive powers
*  into the pre-chorus, standing alone on that hill, using your fuel to kill, we won't
*  take it standing still, watch us dance.
*  The effect these words will have on President Putin is unknown.
*  They capture something though about rock and roll, which has established certain conventions
*  over the last seven decades.
*  One of those conventions is an atmosphere of rebellion.
*  It doesn't have to be real, you probably don't even want it to be, but neither can it
*  seem too contrived, because the defining constraint of rock as a genre is that you have to
*  feel it.
*  The successful rock song creates and listeners the sensation of defying consensus, even if
*  they are right and step with it.
*  The need to feel the rock may explain the documented problems of fans' taste becoming
*  frozen in whatever era was happening when they were between the ages of 15 and 25.
*  Anyone who at a last after Spotify, however, did not grow up with rock as an organically
*  developing form and is likely to have experienced the whole catalog simultaneously, listening
*  to Led Zeppelin at the same time they listened to Pixies and Franz Ferdinand.
*  I.e. as a genre rather than as particular artists, the way my generation, I'm 46, experienced
*  jazz.
*  The members of Monoskin belong to this post-spotify cohort.
*  As the youngest and most prominent custodians of the rock tradition, their job is to sell
*  new guitar-driven songs of 100 to 150 beats per minute to a larger and larger audience,
*  many of whom are young people who primarily think of such music as a historical artifact.
*  Starting this month, Monoskin will take this business on a multivenu tour of the United
*  States, a market where they are considerably less known, whose first stop is Madison Square
*  Garden.
*  I think the genre thing is like Torqueo said to me backstage in Rome, making a gesture
*  that conveyed translingual complexity.
*  We can do a metaphor.
*  If you eat fish, meat, and peanuts every day, like for years, and then you discover potatoes
*  one day, you'll be like, wow, potatoes, I like potatoes, potatoes are great.
*  Potatoes have been there the whole time.
*  Rock was the potato in this metaphor, and he seemed to be saying that even though many
*  people were just now discovering that they liked it, it had actually been around for
*  a long time.
*  It was a revealing analogy.
*  The implication was that rock, like the potato, is here to stay.
*  But what if rock is, like the potato in our age of abundance, comparatively bland, and
*  no longer anyone's favorite?
*  Which rock song came first is a topic of disagreement, but one strong candidate is Rocket 88, recorded
*  by Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm band in 1951.
*  It's about a car, then, in its final verse about drinking in the car.
*  These themes capture the context in which rock and roll emerged, a period when household
*  incomes, availability of consumer goods, and the share of Americans experiencing adolescence
*  all increased simultaneously.
*  Although, and possibly because rock started as black music, it found a gigantic audience
*  of white teenagers during the so-called British invasion of the mid-1960s, the Beatles,
*  the Rolling Stones, the Who, which made it the dominant form of pop music for the next
*  two decades.
*  The stadium progressive era, journey, Fleetwood Mac, foreigner, that now constitutes the bulk
*  of classic rock radio, gave way eventually to punk, the Ramones, Paddy Smith, Minor Threat,
*  and then Glam Metal.
*  Twisted Sister, Guns and Roses, and various other hair-intensive bands that were obliterated
*  by the success of Nirvana and Pearl Jam in 1991.
*  This shift can be understood as the ultimate triumph of punk, both in its return to a mode
*  of content expressed through simpler arrangements and in its professed hostility toward the music
*  industry itself.
*  After 1991, suspicion of anything resembling pop became a mark of seriousness among both
*  rock critics and fans.
*  It is probably not a coincidence that this period is also when Rock's cultural hegemony
*  began to wane.
*  As the 90s progressed, larger and again, wider audiences embraced hip-hop, and the last
*  song classified as Rock to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 was Nickelbacks How
*  You Remind Me in 2001.
*  The run of bands that became popular during the Auts, the strokes, the killers, kings of
*  Leon, constituted Rock's last great commercial gasp, but none of their singles charted higher
*  than number four.
*  Let us say then that the era of Rock as pop music lasted from 1951 to 2011.
*  That's a three-generation run, if you take seriously Rock's advice to get drunk and
*  have sex in the car and therefore produce children at around age 20, baby boomers were
*  the generation that made Rock a zillion-dollar industry.
*  Ben X saved it from that industry with punk and indie, and millennials closed it all
*  out playing guitar hero.
*  The members of Monoskin are between the ages of 22 and 24, situating them firmly within
*  the cadre of people who understand Rock in the past tense.
*  The Angeles, the bassist and Rajee the guitarist, formed the band when they were both attending
*  a music-oriented middle school.
*  Davide was a friend of friends, while Torquio was the only person who responded to their
*  Facebook ad seeking a drummer.
*  There are few entry-level rock venues in Rome, so they started by busking on the streets.
*  In 2017 they entered the cattle-call audition for the Italian version of the X-Factor.
*  They eventually finished as runners-up to the baladier Lorenzo LeCitra and an EP of songs
*  they performed on the show was released by Sony Music and went triple platinum.
*  In 2021, Monoskin won the San Remo Music Festival, earning the right to represent Italy with
*  their song Zitti Eboni, whose title roughly translates to Shut Up and Behave in that year's
*  Eurovision song contest.
*  This program is not widely viewed in the United States, but it is a gigantic deal in Europe,
*  and Monoskin won.
*  Not long after, they began to appear on international singles charts, and I want to be your slave
*  broke the British Top 10.
*  A European tour followed, as well as US appearances at festivals and historic venues.
*  This ascent to Stardom was not unmarried by controversy.
*  The Eurovision live broadcast caught David bending over a table off stage and members
*  of the media accused him of snorting cocaine.
*  David insisted he was innocent and took a drug test which he passed, but Monoskin and
*  their management still seem indignant about the whole affair.
*  It's exactly this kind of incongruous detail.
*  This damaging rumor that a rock star did cocaine that highlights how the Italian music
*  consuming public differs from the American one.
*  Many elements of Monoskin's presentation, like the cross-dressing and the occasional
*  mail-on-mail kiss, are genuinely upsetting to older Italians, even as they seem familiar
*  or even hackneyed to audiences in the United States.
*  They see a band of young, good-looking guys that are dressing up too much and then it's
*  not pure rock and roll because you're not in a garage looking ugly.
*  The angelic says,
*  The more conservative side, they're shocked because of how we dress or move on stage or
*  the boys wear makeup.
*  She and her bandmates are caught between two demographics, the relatively conservative European
*  audience that made them famous, and the more tolerant if not downright desensitized
*  American audience that they must impress to keep the ride moving.
*  And they do have to keep it moving because, like many rock stars before them, most of
*  the band dropped out of high school to do this.
*  At one point, Roger told me that he had sat in on some classes at a university just to
*  try to understand what is that.
*  One question that emerged early in my discussions with Monoskin's friendly and professional
*  management team was whether I was going to say that their music was bad.
*  This concern seemed related to the aforementioned viral pitchfork review, in which the editor,
*  Jeremy Larson, wrote that their new album, Rush, sounds like it's made for introducing
*  the all-new Ford F-150 and seems to be optimized for getting busy in a Buffalo Wild Wings
*  bathroom, on-route to a score of 2.0 out of 10.
*  While the members of Monoskin seemed to take this review philosophically, their press liaisons
*  were concerned that I was coming to Italy to have a similar type of fun.
*  Here I should disclose that Larson edited an essay I wrote for pitchfork about the talking
*  heads album Remain in Light, score 10.0, and that I think of myself as his friend.
*  Possibly because of these biases, I read his review as reflecting his deeply held and
*  among rock fans widely shared need to feel the music, something that the many pop commercial
*  elements of Rush, EG, familiar song structures, lyrics that seem to have emerged from a collaboration
*  between Google Translate and Niki Six, compulsive use of multi-band compression, left him unable
*  to do.
*  This perspective reflects the post-90s rock consensus, PNRC, that anything that sounds too much
*  like a mass market product is no good.
*  The PNRC is premised on the idea that rock is not just a structure of song, but also
*  a structure of relationship between the band and society.
*  From rock's earliest days as black music, the real or perceived opposition between rocker
*  and society has been central to its appeal.
*  This adversarial relationship animated the youth and counter-culture eras of the 60s
*  and then, when the economic dominance of mass market rock made it impossible to believe
*  in, provoked the revitalizing backlash of punk.
*  Even major labels felt obliged to play into this paradoxical world view, EG that period
*  after Nirvana when the most popular genre of music was called alternative.
*  Monoskin however are defined by their isolation from the PNRC.
*  They play rock music, but operate according to the logic of pop.
*  In Milan where Monoskin would finish their Italian mini-tour, I had lunch with the band
*  as well as two of their managers, Marica, Castellino Ovo and Fabrizio Ferraguzzo.
*  Castellino Ovo had been an executive producer working on the X-Factor and Ferraguzzo was
*  its musical director.
*  Around the time that Monoskin broke through, Castellino Ovo and Ferraguzzo left the show
*  and began working with the stars it had made.
*  We were at the in-house restaurant of Moisa, the combination recording studio, soundstage,
*  rehearsal space, offices, party venue and creative playground that Ferraguzzo opened two months
*  earlier.
*  They were clarifying that he was in no way criticizing major record labels and the many
*  vendors they engaged to record, promote and distribute albums.
*  He laid out his vision for Moisa, a place where all those functions were performed by a single,
*  corporate entity, basically describing the concept of vertical integration.
*  Ferraguzzo oversaw the recording of Rush along with a group of producers that included
*  Max Martin, the Swedish hitmaker best known for his work with Backstreet Boys and Britney
*  Spears.
*  At Moisa, Ferraguzzo played for me, Monoskins then unreleased new single Honey Are You Coming,
*  which features many of the band's signature moves, guitar and bass playing the same melodic
*  phrases at the same time, unswong boogie-type rhythm of the post-strokes style, but also has
*  Davide singing in a higher register than usual.
*  I listened to it first on studio monitors and then through the speaker of Ferraguzzo's
*  own, and it sounded clean and well-produced both times as if a team of industry veterans
*  with unlimited access to espresso had come together to perfect it.
*  The sheer number of older and more experienced professionals involved in Monoskin introduces
*  attention between the rock conventions that characterize their songwriting and the fundamentally
*  pop circumstances under which those songs are produced.
*  They are four friends in a band, but that band is inside an enormous machine.
*  From their perspective though, the machine is good.
*  There's hundreds of people working and talking about you and giving opinions, Angela
*  said a lunch.
*  So if you start to get in this loop of wanting to know and control and being anxious about
*  it, it really ruins everything.
*  Here lies the conflict between what the PNRC wants from a band.
*  It's two outside influences, contempt for commerce, authenticity as measured in doing
*  everything themselves, and what any sane 23 year old would want, which is to have someone
*  with an MBA make all the decisions so she can concentrate on playing bass.
*  The other way Monoskin is isolated from the PNRC is geographic.
*  Over the course of lunch, it became clear that they had encyclopedic knowledge of certain
*  years as an American rock history, but were only dimly aware of others.
*  Raji for instance loves Molly Crew and has an album by album command of the Los Angeles
*  hair metal band Skid Row, which he and his bandmates seemed to understand were supposed to be
*  guilty pleasures.
*  But none of them had ever heard of Fugazi, the post hardcore band whose hatred of major
*  labels refusal to sell merchandise and commitment to keeping ticket prices as low as possible,
*  set the standard for a generation of American rock snobs.
*  In general, Monoskin's timeline of influences seems to break off around 1990, when the rock
*  most respected by Anglophone critics was produced by independent labels that did not have
*  strong overseas distribution.
*  It picks up again with Franz Ferdinand and the emo era of mainstream pop rock.
*  This retrospect leaves them unaware of the indie, punk DIY period that was probably
*  most important in forming the PNRC.
*  The question is whether that consensus still matters.
*  While snobs like Larson and me are overrepresented in journalism, we never constituted a majority
*  of rock fans.
*  That's the whole point of being a snob, and snobbery is obsolete anyway.
*  Digital distribution ended the correlation between how obscure your favorite band was and
*  how much effort you put into listening to them.
*  The longevity of rock and roll as a genre, meanwhile, has solidified a core audience that
*  is now between the ages of 40 and 80, rendering the fan versus society dimension of the PNRC
*  impossible to believe.
*  And the economics of the industry, in which streaming has reduced the profit margin on recorded
*  music, and the closure of small venues has made stadiums and big auditoriums the only
*  reliable way to make money on tour have decimated the indie model.
*  All these forces have converged to make rock, for the first time in its history, merely
*  a way of writing songs instead of a way of life.
*  Yet rock, as a cluster of signifiers, retains its power around the world.
*  In the same way everyone knows what a castle is and what it signifies, even though actual
*  castles are no longer a meaningful force in our lives, rock remains a shared language
*  of cultural expression even though it is no longer determining our friendships, turning
*  children against their parents, yelling truth at power, etc.
*  Also like a castle, a lot of people will pay good money to see a preserved historical
*  example of rock or even a convincing replica of it, especially in Europe.
*  In Milan, the temperature had dropped 20 degrees, and monoskins show at Stadio Giuseppe
*  Meazza, commonly known as San Ciro, the largest stadium in Italy, sold out that night at
*  60,000, was threatened by thunderstorms instead of record-breaking heat.
*  Fans remained undaunted, many camped in the parking lot the night before in order to be
*  among the first to enter the stadium.
*  One of them was Tamra, an American who reported her age as 60 and a half, and said she had
*  skipped a reservation to see Da Vinci's last supper in order to stay in line.
*  When you get to knocking on the door, you kind of want to do what you want, she said.
*  The threat of rain was made good at pretty much the exact moment the show began.
*  The sea of black t-shirts on the pitch became a field of multicolored ponchos, and raindrops
*  were bouncing visibly off the surface of the stage.
*  Davide lost his footing near the end of I Want to Be Your Slave, briefly rolling to
*  his back, while D'Angeles, who is very good at making lips parted in ecstasy-type rock
*  faces, played with her eyes turned upward to the flashing sky, like a martyr.
*  The rain stopped in time for cool kids, a punk-inspired song in which Davide affects a
*  cockney accent to sing about the vexed cultural position of rock and roll.
*  Cool kids, they do not like rock, they only listen to trap and pop.
*  These are probably the monoskin lyrics most quoted by music journalists, although they
*  should probably be taken with a grain of salt, considering that the song also contains
*  lyrics like, I like doing things I love, yeah, and cool kids, they do not vomit.
*  Cool kids was the last song before the encore, and each night a few dozen good-looking
*  20-somethings were released onto the stage to dance, and then, as the band walked off,
*  to make, we're not worthy bows around Raji's abandoned guitar.
*  The whole thing looked at least semi-choreographed, but management assured me that the cool kids
*  were not professional dancers, just enthusiastic fans who had been asked if they wanted to be
*  part of the show.
*  I kept trying to meet the person in charge of wrangling these cool kids, and there kept
*  being new reasons that was not possible.
*  The regular kids, on the other hand, were available and friendly throughout.
*  In Rome, Dorca, and Sarah, two young members of a monoskin fan club saw my notebook and
*  shot right over to tell me they loved the band because, as Sarah put it, they allow you
*  to be yourself.
*  When asked whether they felt their culture was conservative in ways that prevented them
*  from being themselves, Dorca, who was 21 and wearing eyeglasses that looked like part
*  of her daily wardrobe and a mesh top that didn't, said, maybe it turns out that you can
*  be yourself, but you don't know that at first.
*  You feel like you can't.
*  Here lies the element of rock that functions independently from the economics of the industry,
*  or the shifting preferences of critics.
*  The part that is maybe independent from time itself.
*  A continually renewed experience of adolescence, of hearing, and therefore feeling it all for
*  the first time.
*  But how disorienting must those feelings be when they have been fully monetized, fully sanctioned
*  when the response to your demand to rock and roll all night and party every day is great
*  exactly.
*  Thank you.
*  In a culture where defying consensus is the dominant value, anything is possible except
*  rebellion.
*  It must be strange in this post-everything century to finally become yourself and discover
*  that no one has any problem with that.
