*  Hi, my name is Nicholas Casey and I'm a staff writer at the New York Times magazine
*  based in Madrid.
*  There's a man whose name almost everyone knows in Spain, and that man just happens to be
*  a spy.
*  His influence reaches back to Francisco Franco, the former nationalist dictator whose
*  secret police was where he started his career in the 1970s.
*  He worked as an intelligence officer for years, until he got busted for money laundering
*  in 2017.
*  When the police raided his home, they found something that would rattles Spanish society
*  for years to come.
*  A huge trove of tapes.
*  Thousands of hours of secret audio recordings of Spain's most powerful people, spending
*  decades.
*  There's a recording of a judge talking about granting a favor to a well known arms trafficker.
*  There's another recording involving the former lover of the ex-King of Spain, Juan Carlos,
*  talking about King's alleged secret bank accounts in Switzerland.
*  These tapes have caused scandal after scandal in Spain, and the man pressing the record
*  button was Jose Manuel Biedejo, also known here as the King of the Seuers.
*  Since the time of Franco, who took power in the era of Hitler and Mussolini, Spaniards
*  have whispered about this concept of sewers.
*  They don't mean literal drainage.
*  They're talking about a shadow state or a deep state, a whole network of people who run
*  the country from behind the scenes.
*  That includes military personnel, certain judges, some well-connected businessmen, and of
*  course, the people running the spy agency.
*  Biedejo, because he was in contact with all these people, was able to record everybody.
*  And as these tapes have trickled out, the country has watched as some of the biggest names
*  in Spain have had to come out and explain why they were on these tapes and what they said.
*  And for that reason, Biedejo has become one of the most notorious people in the country
*  right now.
*  He is also a relic of Spain's long dictatorial past.
*  Of a time when it was okay to tap people's phone lines or to lock up political centers.
*  In many ways, he's sort of a dinosaur still walking this earth from a time when Spain
*  was a very, very different country from what it is today.
*  A few months ago, I got a mysterious message from someone asking if I'd like to meet Biedejo.
*  Biedejo was reaching the end of his trial, and it looked like he was going to go back
*  to jail for a number of years.
*  He wanted to tell his side of the story about how he got the tapes.
*  And so I headed out to the suburbs of Madrid where he lives.
*  And the Sunday read you'll hear is based on what I learned.
*  So here's my story, the spy who called me, read by Anthony Ray Perez.
*  The wave of scandals that would engulf Spain began with a police raid on a wooded property
*  outside Madrid.
*  It was November 3rd, 2017, and the target was Jose Manuel Villerejo Perez, a former government
*  spy.
*  Villerejo's name had been circulating in the Spanish press for years.
*  He was rumored to have had powerful friends and to have kept dirt on them all.
*  The impressive variety of allegations against him, forgery, bribery, extortion, influence
*  pedaling, had earned him the nickname, King of the Sears.
*  In the late morning, the police, some of them scaling the fence around his compound, forced
*  their way inside.
*  They had come searching for evidence of money laundering, but it wasn't Biedejo's accounting
*  books that gave them pause that day.
*  In the spies living room, there was a safe, and in the safe there were audio recordings.
*  A pile of encrypted hard drives, large tape cassettes and micro cassettes that were made
*  over decades, amounting to thousands of hours.
*  On them could be heard the voices of Spain's richest and most powerful people.
*  Most of them had been secretly recorded by Villerejo.
*  I said to myself, it's not a legend, it's true.
*  He'd been recording everything for the last 40 years.
*  A prosecutor in the case said in an interview years later.
*  For many decades, Villerejo's face had been known to almost no one.
*  He was, after all, the spy, and not just any spy, but one who had started his career
*  in the secret police of the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco.
*  In those years, he was dressed in overalls from Delefónica, the national telephone company,
*  as he conducted surveillance operations in the mountains.
*  And on several occasions, he even wore a pre-scholar in order to infiltrate the Basque
*  Separatist group, Eta.
*  More recently, Villerejo had taken to simply introducing himself as a lawyer who ran a private
*  investigation firm, offering those he met to dig up compromising material on their enemies.
*  His formal connection to the government was increasingly ambiguous.
*  Of all of the identities he assumed over the years, this was perhaps the most powerful
*  one.
*  He made him rich through the hefty fees he charged, and it opened the door into the worlds
*  of business tycoons, government ministers, aristocrats, judges, newspaper editors, and
*  arms traffickers, all of whose trust he gained, all of whose private words he taped.
*  Villerejo was handcuffed and taken to Madrid, but as he sat in jail awaiting trial, the
*  question left hanging over Spain was this, what happens to a country's secrets when
*  they have all been recorded by one man?
*  And what happens when that man finds himself suddenly backed into a corner?
*  The answer it seemed came the next year, as tapes began leaking to the press.
*  There was the tape of Spain's then Justice Minister, the woman overseeing the court system
*  that would try Villerejo, overheard using a slur for gay people.
*  There was the tape of the judge in Villerejo's case considering whether it's a grant of
*  favor to an arms dealer.
*  There were tapes of the former deputy leader of a major political party, of a bank executive,
*  of a prominent Spanish lawyer who was helping Julian Assange.
*  There were the tapes about Juan Carlos Primero, Spain's former king.
*  The voice on the recordings wasn't the monarchs, but that of a former lover, Corrinazuzain
*  Vikinstein telling Villerejo of her disappointment in Juan Carlos.
*  For years, she said he had been hiding money in Swiss bank accounts and had secretly been
*  given a penthouse by the Sultan of Oman.
*  He behaves like a five-year-old with his toys, she says.
*  Prosecutors soon opened corruption investigations against the former king.
*  As this all unfolded, Villerejo insisted that he'd had nothing to do with the leaks, but
*  he also warned, rather darkly, that he had been recording people for decades, and then
*  only a small portion of his trove had been released.
*  Villerejo had become something akin to Jay Edgar Hoover, the longtime FBI director who
*  kept damaging recordings of leftist activists and powerful politicians for the purpose,
*  sometimes explicit, sometimes implicit, of blackmail.
*  But unlike Hoover, Villerejo had been arrested, and it seemed he was now using his tapes
*  to attack the very state that was prosecuting him.
*  Adding to the mystery were the outlets where the leaks were published, often small websites
*  that appeared out of nowhere with blockbuster scoops.
*  As more tapes surfaced, many show new crimes Villerejo may have committed, triggering additional
*  investigations against him.
*  To many, it pointed to a bizarre possibility.
*  As Villerejo was leaking some of his tapes to bring down his enemies in the government,
*  they were leaking others to further incriminate him.
*  The problem for everyone is he recorded everything he was doing.
*  Alejandro Suarez, the owner of Monc Loa.com, one of the websites that published the leaks
*  told me, at these lunches you can hear him going to the bathroom to pee and talking to
*  himself in the urinal.
*  Then, early this year, there came another twist.
*  I received word from a man who wished to remain anonymous, a friend of Villerejo's, he said.
*  Villerejo had given few interviews since his arrest, but the judge was nearing a verdict
*  in his latest case, and Villerejo feared he would go to jail for many years.
*  Before that happened, the man said, Villerejo wanted to tell his side of the story.
*  Did I want to meet Spain's most famous spy?
*  Villerejo suggested we meet at a stake house a short drive from his home on a cold day in
*  January.
*  Without a disguise, he looks quite ordinary.
*  He portly 71-year-old with white stubble on his face, a bald head, and a baritone laugh.
*  He has a penchant for curse words and stories that end with off-color jokes, but before we
*  got very far into our conversation, I needed to interrupt him.
*  Are you recording us right now?
*  I asked.
*  His banter stopped, and for a moment he looked offended.
*  He wasn't recording me, he said, with the insistence of someone who had never recorded
*  someone without their previous consent.
*  In fact, he worried that he was being recorded by someone by way of a phone tap.
*  The idea seemed plausible.
*  Villerejo has countless enemies in Spain, and yet this kind of role reversal is exactly
*  the thing you expect from a man who spent his career trafficking in information.
*  When people call Villerejo the king of the sewers, Erre de las cloacas, they're referring
*  not to literal sewers, but to a shadow state or deep state that, many say, has pulled
*  lovers of power in the country since the time of Franco.
*  The nationalist dictator who took power in the same era as Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.
*  But unlike them, he ruled his country until 1975, and a decade-long dictatorship whose ghosts
*  remain easy to spot to this day.
*  Franco's former mausoleum still overlooks the capital.
*  Stalin's time zone remains an hour off from its original one because Franco changed
*  the clocks to match the hour in Nazi Germany.
*  Part of the reason dinner here often begins at 10 pm.
*  And then there are the so-called sewers, a network of current and former police chiefs,
*  intelligence officials and military officials, all largely men of Villerejo's generation,
*  who grew up under the dictatorship and still wield power now.
*  He was among this crowd that Villerejo had been dubbed king.
*  I asked him what he thought of that title.
*  He shrugged.
*  What people don't understand is that sewers don't generate the crap.
*  They clean the city.
*  They take the crap away.
*  He began.
*  Rome triumphed because it had good sewers.
*  He told me about his sanctuary in the Roman form, the Shrine of Venus, Clawakina, built
*  to celebrate the city's drainage system.
*  Sure, you go into certain places and you come out smiling bad.
*  But someone has to do this work.
*  And instead of punishing the guy who does this job, we should think about thanking him.
*  The spy began recounting to me the long story of his life.
*  He was born in 1951 in the end of the Lusion Town, El Garpeo, a son of a pharmacist and
*  a midwife.
*  Villerejo started his career in Franco's military during a time when conscription was mandatory.
*  If the morality of fighting for a dictator weighed on him as a young man, it certainly didn't
*  show now.
*  He reminisced about Antonio Gonzales Pateco, known as Billy Vicod, and a Tories police agent
*  of the regime who later was charged with torture.
*  He was a great success.
*  Villerejo said.
*  He joked about a failed coup d'état in 1981, attempted by right wing officers who
*  burst into the Congress of deputies with guns.
*  Villerejo was flipping through the decades like someone trying to find his place in an old
*  book.
*  I interjected to ask about his time as a soldier, why did he leave the military?
*  Villerejo took a deep breath.
*  He was a loyal soldier, he said, but the army was just not for him.
*  Since I was always rebellious, I could have been an
*  anarchist, but another side of me believed in order, discipline, and the Fatherland.
*  I wanted to help my country, but I couldn't submit to the rules.
*  Unhappy as a soldier, Villerejo instead became an intelligence agent.
*  In the early 1970s, he joined the social investigation brigade, a branch of Franco's
*  secret police charged with brooding out this loyalty.
*  Most often, the targets were left as activists and student leaders who were jailed for years.
*  Political opponents were silenced with blackmail, fed by secrets delivered up from tapped
*  phone lines.
*  Villerejo was at the center of these dark arts, and he seemed to relish describing them
*  to me in detail.
*  He recalled a somewhat cinematic incident from his undercover work against Etta, involving
*  a woman he met at a bar in the seaside city, Sangsavastian.
*  One morning while leaving her bedroom, Villerejo said he ran into a yaky pere's beltegi,
*  who went by the alias Wilson, a leader of the very group he had been pursuing.
*  At that moment, we both knew we were with the same woman.
*  Villerejo recalled, saying the men did an exchange words.
*  The love triangle continued.
*  It was the 70s.
*  He told me, as though this explained everything you needed to know.
*  Villerejo began to press the woman for intelligence on her other boyfriend.
*  While this sort of 007 style intrigue was impossible to confirm decades later, what was clear
*  was that Villerejo seemed to live for it.
*  But that arrow was about to come to an end.
*  With his health declining, Franco announced that he had decided on a successor, a Spanish
*  royal who would be named King, with powers akin to Franco's after the dictator's death.
*  The man was Juan Carlos.
*  In the end, Spain's new king in waiting didn't want to become a monocrat.
*  He saw a return to democracy in the often, and after Franco's death, Juan Carlos kept
*  the title given to him, but began reforms.
*  Voters approved a constitution in 1978, and four years later, the head of the Socialist
*  Party, Felipe González, became Prime Minister.
*  The changes did not bode well for Villerejo.
*  The new Prime Minister ordered a purge of Franco holdovers in the police.
*  Villerejo, who was head of the police union at the time, was now on the ounce that Spain
*  sought a different way.
*  Villerejo finished his dessert.
*  In sorbet, he'd ordered along with an espresso.
*  He put on his hat and glasses, and we both stood up to go to the door.
*  But he asked me to sit down and wait for a few minutes alone, as he walked out first.
*  He was very likely that his former intelligence colleagues were following him.
*  He said, and he didn't want to be seen leaving with a journalist.
*  He added that I, too, should keep a little profile in the coming weeks, because if I wanted
*  to write about him, these same people would want to interfere.
*  He'll see.
*  He said as he ducked out.
*  I know how these things work.
*  Remember that people called me the king of the sewers.
*  Before our next meeting, Villerejo sent me a copy of a letter that he wrote to a judge
*  in his case.
*  It ran to more than a hundred pages and was peppered with references to great thinkers
*  of the past.
*  The suffocates, Da Vinci, Machiavelli, George Orwell, and a 17th century Jesuit theologian
*  named Herman Busenbaum.
*  It was, to say the least, a confusing read.
*  But throughout the letter, Villerejo hewed to a simple defense, that while not completely
*  innocent of the accusations against him, he was operating in a system where his kind of
*  espionage was long accepted.
*  He was a patriot.
*  He declared following the orders that he was given to protect the state.
*  If there was a problem, the problem wasn't with him.
*  He argued.
*  It was with Spain itself, for letting Villerejo be Villerejo.
*  When next we met, it was at his lawyer's office in Madrid on the 5th floor of a cream
*  colored building.
*  Villerejo and the lawyer stood up to greet me.
*  I started by asking Villerejo why he had wanted to do these interviews at all.
*  He thought for a moment.
*  He had been savaged by his enemies in public.
*  He sent to the point that he was now a boogeyman in the eyes of most Spaniards.
*  Now everyone knew his face, but no one knew him, and he wanted that to change.
*  He chose me.
*  He added, because he could tell I was an honest man.
*  Which flattery must have opened many doors for him in the past.
*  I thanked him, but added that I needed him to be honest too.
*  Who is leaking your tapes, I asked.
*  Those tapes were taken from me by the police.
*  He sent.
*  Ask them.
*  I told him I found that hard to believe.
*  He was a spy, and spies kept copies of things in case they were taken.
*  Villerejo stared at me for a moment.
*  Well, he said, if he did have a copy, then it wouldn't be with him.
*  It would be with a friend.
*  And the friend, he said, would need to be in another country,
*  and under very strict instructions not to release the tapes,
*  unless Villerejo personally traveled abroad to give him instructions to do so.
*  Because he wasn't allowed to leave the country currently, there would be no way
*  he could be behind the leaks.
*  We weren't getting far with the tapes.
*  Villerejo told me that after he left the police, he set up a private investigation firm.
*  One of his first accounts involved the Church of Scientology,
*  which Villerejo told me was worried about imposters using its branding without permission.
*  Villerejo sent investigators to take seminars offered by rogue Scientologists in various
*  Spanish cities, and church lawyers followed up threatening legal action.
*  A 1990 article published in the Spanish newspaper ABC mentions a trial in which Villerejo
*  and church members were accused of framing one of the uncooperative Scientology imposters
*  for a robbery by co-worsing a recovering drug addict to falsely implicate him.
*  The group was later acquitted.
*  Scientology officials were so impressed by his work, he claimed,
*  that they flew him to Los Angeles to attend a gathering of top church members,
*  where Villerejo says he briefly met John Travolta.
*  The Church of Scientology says it has no record of Villerejo attending such an event.
*  During the party, Villerejo told me, he had tape rolling, as he always did.
*  Why, though?
*  There was, he said, so much you missed in a conversation if you couldn't listen to it later.
*  The shades and nuances, they are all there in a recording.
*  The tonality, the timbre of the voice, he told me.
*  You can hear when they have doubts about the information they are telling you.
*  At first, he strapped large tape recorders to his chest, but when microcassette devices
*  became widely available in Spain, he sneaked them inside his socks.
*  Finally, he just used his smartphone.
*  He recorded everyone, he said.
*  A Moroccan general who was assigned to protect the royal family, he has been looking for
*  the bank account of assumed to be ex-wife.
*  At one point, Villerejo taped Montserrat Casar and notorious Syrian arms trafficker living
*  in Spain, a recording that became part of an American federal court case against him.
*  I don't want some trap.
*  The trafficker told Villerejo before this thing operation that caught him.
*  He had mentioned Villerejo to anyone in Madrid, and there is only one set of recordings
*  that they want to know about.
*  At one of our next meetings, I told Villerejo that I wanted to spend the morning talking
*  about the tapes concerning the former king, Juan Carlos.
*  He looked at his lawyer for a second, considering where to begin.
*  After a decade of working on his own as a freelancer, Villerejo said, he got a call from Spanish
*  officials.
*  They were asking him to go undercover again for the national police.
*  Once pushed aside by the government for being a member of Suez, Villerejo was now back
*  at the center of the intelligence establishment.
*  Villerejo folded his arms over his chest and looked in both directions, the way one does
*  before letting you in on a big secret.
*  In his last years as king, Villerejo said Juan Carlos fell in love with Corina Susanne
*  with Cristina, a German-born Danish national who kept the name of her aristocratic ex-husband,
*  Prince Cassie Mir, of sign with Cristina sign.
*  She met Juan Carlos on a hunting trip in Spain.
*  The affair was an open secret, and before long, Juan Carlos told members of his circle that
*  he planned to divorce his wife, Queen Sofia, and married Susanne with Cristina.
*  Officials at C&I, Spain's national intelligence service, were alarmed.
*  A divorce could seriously harm the reputation of the monarchy.
*  Spain's most traditional institution after the Roman Catholic Church.
*  According to Villerejo, intelligence agents devised a plan to break the couple up.
*  Nick named Operation Fadi after Fadi Nelly, an Italian singer who, after being castrated,
*  became one of the most celebrated sopranos of the 18th century.
*  The plan was to do something similar to the king.
*  Military bodyguards were recruited to replace pills in his pillbox with female hormones.
*  The idea Villerejo said was that the drugs would cause Juan Carlos's hair to fall out and
*  decrease his libido, such that neither the king nor his lover would find each other attractive.
*  I asked Villerejo to stop for a second.
*  It sounded like a ridiculous plan, I said.
*  How did he feel about it?
*  It all seemed wonderful, he said, laughing.
*  But then again, the king could have been poisoned.
*  C&I has never acknowledged that such an operation took place.
*  The couple eventually ended their relationship, though the breakup seemed to be more about
*  the king's inability to stay faithful to his mistress than the plot from the Spanish
*  spies.
*  This however created a new headache for C&I.
*  The spy agency Villerejo said, believed that Susine Vikenshtai had access to a trove
*  of damaging royal documents and intended to use them to blackmail her former lover.
*  So in the spring of 2015, Villerejo was dispatched once again.
*  This time he would go undercover to London to befriend Susine Vikenshtai with the hope
*  that she would tell him the location of the files and all that they contained.
*  Villerejo sought an introduction from a mutual friend and the two men met Susine Vikenshtai
*  in her apartment in London's Eaton Square.
*  Villerejo said he asked for green tea, sat down and established his cover.
*  He was a lawyer with deep connections to the intelligence community, but unlike other
*  officials, he felt she had been treated unfairly and he wanted to help.
*  Villerejo told me that to help him gain her trust, intelligence officials even sent him
*  with documents to share with her that outlined plans by officials to frame Susine Vikenshtai
*  for financial crimes.
*  When I listened to the tape of the conversation, the leaked clips are now easy to find online.
*  I could hear Susine Vikenshtai in the center.
*  She then starts to take off a list of dirty financial dealings she was aware of during
*  the relationship.
*  Juan Carlos kept hidden bank accounts in Switzerland, she said.
*  He had used one of his lawyers and a cousin as frontman in numerous transactions, including
*  payments for private flights he took.
*  The King's advisors had tried to put a property given to him by the King of Morocco under
*  her name to shield him from tax payments.
*  And they started waging war against me because I didn't want to commit a crime, she says.
*  Villerejo and Susine Vikenshtai met again the next year in London.
*  Bay and Italian restaurant and Villerejo said he broke his rule of not drinking during
*  operations when she bought a bottle of fine wine.
*  She said she had some love letters but nothing amounting to an archive of the King's
*  secrets.
*  Villerejo kept pushing but Susine Vikenshtai kept returning to her frustration about her
*  relationship with the former King.
*  She had truly wanted this man.
*  Villerejo told me.
*  I think she was really in love with him.
*  Whether the former King's former lover really did have compromising documents remains unknown.
*  But what's clear is this.
*  The operation to protect the monarchy backfired in 2018 when the tapes began to leak and
*  prosecutors opened multiple investigations into the former King's activities, including
*  for tax fraud.
*  In 2020, Juan Carlos Primento announced that he was abandoning his country.
*  Shortly after that, he turned up at the Emirates Palace Hotel in Abu Dhabi and the United
*  Arab Emirates, a fellow monarchy seen as unlikely to extradite him.
*  As I continued to report on Villerejo, I kept thinking of his parting words after our
*  first meeting near his home.
*  But having spent so long practicing the dark arts of intelligence in Spain, he was certain
*  that the country's powers that be would try to interfere with the article about him
*  that I was writing.
*  I dismisten as bluster at the time.
*  I remember the well-connected editor, Madrid, telling me once that for every truth Villerejo
*  offered, he also had five lives.
*  Then came a message from Jose Bautista, my researcher in Madrid.
*  Someone had just sent him a file filled with dozens of unpublished Villerejo audio recordings.
*  I had told Bautista that I was meeting with the spy, but gave him strict orders not to
*  tell anyone else.
*  And he had kept to them.
*  I asked him who he thought had sent the files.
*  It wasn't clear, he said, but the source seemed to be someone close to Spain's intelligence
*  service who did not like Villerejo.
*  I hadn't contacted anyone in Spanish intelligence yet about the story.
*  It all seemed like a strange coincidence.
*  In the end, we found no blockbuster in the dump of recordings.
*  We listened to dozens of tapes, some just a few minutes in length, others lasting
*  for hours.
*  They were muffled, largely undated and came with little context.
*  We weren't the first journalist to receive part of Villerejo's vast archive and realize
*  the fundamental truth about it.
*  He recorded everything, and much of it is of little interest.
*  But the source had also sent a copy of a handwritten daily agenda Villerejo's with the
*  names and dates for many meetings.
*  The agenda book was more useful, offering a way to cross-reference many of the meetings
*  Villerejo claimed to have had.
*  There was one part of Villerejo's tale that I couldn't seem to confirm anywhere.
*  Operation Fadi, the attempt to drug the king.
*  The plan seemed just too far-fetched, too much like the CIA's proposed plan to depose
*  Fidel Castro by first making his beard fall out.
*  The only person I knew who might have answers was Tsu's sign Wikenshtine herself.
*  This April, after several requests, she agreed to meet, and I flew to London.
*  On a rainy Tuesday afternoon, she welcomed me into her house, inviting me to sit at the
*  same table where she met years before with Villerejo.
*  Her life was filled with legal battles now.
*  She sent.
*  She had testified in one of Villerejo's cases and had her own lawsuit against Juan Carlos,
*  who she said had sent other intelligence officials to harass her.
*  The former head of the intelligence agency, Felix Sanz Rodan, once threatened her and
*  her children's lives, she said.
*  Sanz Rodan told me he didn't want to talk about it, but told a court he hadn't threatened
*  them.
*  Juan Carlos' personal lawyer, Javier Sanchez Hongco, told me of his client's ex-girlfriend
*  net.
*  99% of what she says is false.
*  He pointed out that Juan Carlos had settled his tax problems with the Spanish government
*  by paying back taxes and all investigations against him there had been closed.
*  Finally, I asked her if she recalled anything about the king's hair falling out.
*  She did.
*  Juan Carlos, she said, was the first to suspect that someone was tampering with his medication
*  after the couple noticed that his face was starting to bloat.
*  Su-Sine, Wilkinsh Dine, said she eventually flew a doctor in from France to examine
*  Juan Carlos.
*  The doctor also looked at his medicine box and found suspicious pills.
*  The couple had suspected Spain's intelligence agency was behind the plot, but had no evidence
*  that could prove it.
*  I asked how she felt about having been lied to by Vierrejo.
*  She said it was a betrayal, and that she found it odd that so many in the country had all
*  worked with the same dirty spy.
*  Vierrejo shows that there stuck in the modus upper Andy, a Franco, she said.
*  It's still a shady world where nothing is what it appears to be.
*  It's crazy that this could happen in Europe in the 21st century.
*  In one of my last meetings with Vierrejo and Madrid, I asked him how he was holding up.
*  He had spent three years in four months in preventive detention before being released
*  in the spring of 2021.
*  The verdict he was awaiting from the trial last September, which he assumed would not
*  be in his favor, was on charges of bribery, influence peddling, and disclosure of non-state
*  secrets.
*  It could put him behind bars for as many as 20 years.
*  Vierrejo had won some legal battles, including a defamation case that went to trial in 2021,
*  and prosecutors have dropped a dozen other investigations.
*  But more than 30 investigations into additional allegations of bribery and influence peddling,
*  as well as embezzlement of public funds, falsifying documents, criminal conspiracy, and
*  threatening a dermatologist with a knife on behalf of one of his clients.
*  Remain.
*  Vierrejo could be defending himself the rest of his life.
*  For the moment, he said he was spending most of his days back at home, meditating and
*  listening to Monteverdi and Baccarini.
*  I tried to imagine Vierrejo meditating in his Spanish jail at the end of a long prosecution.
*  I tried to imagine the investigators applauding themselves for bringing him to justice.
*  But I couldn't see a system that had changed very much.
*  There was just an old man, an unreliable narrator, and best, telling his story one last time,
*  and one last attempt to use his secrets to turn the course of events in his favor.
*  I thought again about the years of audio leaks that resulted from the police raid long
*  go.
*  The attempt to bring down Vierrejo far from draining the sewer had simply caused it to
*  overflow.
*  Now everyone could smell what was down there.
*  I looked up at Vierrejo and asked him again.
*  Had he leaked the tapes, I would be crazy to leak the tapes.
*  He said, but he didn't sound quite as convinced this time.
*  It had been a long day together.
*  Vierrejo looked down at my recorders.
*  I used two of them in case one cut out.
*  He told me about times when his recorder failed, and he lost unrepeatable conversations
*  with unrepeatable people.
*  He had recordings of Spain's Prime Minister, he said, of the handover of a Spanish tune
*  of vessel captured by Somali pirates.
*  Of… he trailed off.
*  I had heard this before.
*  He told me he hoped someone would get to listen to his full archive one day.
*  Not just the leaked bits.
*  It is bigger than me.
*  He said, I meant so many people.
*  It's my history there.
*  The entire history of this country is in there.
