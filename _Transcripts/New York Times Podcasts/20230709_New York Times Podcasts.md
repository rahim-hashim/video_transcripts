# The Sunday Read: ‘The Spy Who Called Me’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FYxlJjo0XM)
*  Hi, my name is Nicolas Casey and I'm a staff writer at the New York Times magazine based
*  in Madrid.
*  There's a man whose name almost everyone knows in Spain.
*  And that man just happens to be a spy.
*  His influence reaches back to Francisco Franco, the former nationalist dictator whose secret
*  police was where he started his career in the 1970s.
*  He worked as an intelligence officer for years until he got busted for money laundering in
*  2017.
*  When the police raided his home, they found something that would rattle Spanish society
*  for years to come.
*  A huge trove of tapes.
*  Hours of hours of secret audio recordings of Spain's most powerful people spanning
*  decades.
*  There's a recording of a judge talking about granting a favor to a well-known arms trafficker.
*  There's another recording involving the former lover of the ex-King of Spain, Juan Carlos,
*  talking about the King's alleged secret bank accounts in Switzerland.
*  These tapes have caused scandal after scandal in Spain.
*  And the man pressing the record button was José Manuel Biarejo, also known here as the
*  King of the Sewers.
*  Since the time of Franco, who took power in the era of Hitler and Mussolini, Spaniards
*  have whispered about this concept of sewers.
*  They don't mean literal drainage.
*  They're talking about a shadow state or a deep state.
*  A whole network of people who run the country from behind the scenes.
*  That includes military personnel, certain judges, some well-connected businessmen, and
*  of course the people running the spy agency.
*  Biarejo, because he was in contact with all these people, was able to record everybody.
*  And as these tapes have trickled out, the country is watched as some of the biggest
*  names in Spain have had to come out and explain why they were on these tapes and what they
*  said.
*  And for that reason, Biarejo has become one of the most notorious people in the country
*  right now.
*  He is also a relic of Spain's long dictatorial past, of a time when it was okay to tap people's
*  phone lines or to lock up political dissenters.
*  In many ways, he's sort of a dinosaur still walking this earth from a time when Spain
*  was a very, very different country from what it is today.
*  A few months ago, I got a mysterious message from someone asking if I'd like to meet Biarejo.
*  Biarejo was reaching the end of his trial, and it looked like he was going to go back
*  to jail for a number of years.
*  He wanted to tell his side of the story about how he got the tapes.
*  So I headed out to the suburbs of Madrid where he lives.
*  And the Sunday read you'll hear is based on what I learned.
*  So here's my story, The Spy Who Called Me, read by Anthony Rey Perez.
*  3rd of November, 2017, and the target was Jose Manuel Biarejo Perez, a former government
*  spy.
*  Biarejo's name had been circulating in the Spanish press for years.
*  He was rumored to have had powerful friends and to have kept dirt on them all.
*  The impressive variety of allegations against him, forgery, bribery, extortion, influence
*  peddling, had earned him the nickname King of the Sewers.
*  In the late morning, the police, some of them scaling the fence around his compound, forced
*  their way inside.
*  They had come searching for evidence of money laundering, but it wasn't Biarejo's accounting
*  books that gave them pause that day.
*  In the spy's living room, there was a safe, and in the safe there were audio recordings,
*  a pile of encrypted hard drives, large tape cassettes and micro cassettes that were made
*  over decades, amounting to thousands of hours.
*  On them could be heard the voices of Spain's richest and most powerful people.
*  Most of them had been secretly recorded by Biarejo.
*  I said to myself, it's not a legend, it's true.
*  He'd been recording everything for the last 40 years, a prosecutor in the case said in
*  an interview years later.
*  For many decades, Biarejo's face had been known to almost no one.
*  He was, after all, a spy.
*  And not just any spy, but one who had started his career in the secret police of the Spanish
*  dictator Francisco Franco.
*  In those years he would dress in overalls from Telefonica, the national telephone company,
*  as he conducted surveillance operations in the mountains, and on several occasions he
*  even more a priest caller in order to infiltrate the Basque separatist group ETA.
*  More recently, Biarejo had taken to simply introducing himself as a lawyer who ran a
*  private investigation firm, offering those he met to dig up compromising material on
*  their enemies.
*  His formal connection to the government was increasingly ambiguous.
*  Of all of the identities he assumed over the years, this was perhaps the most powerful
*  one.
*  He became rich through the hefty fees he charged, and it opened a door into the worlds of business
*  tycoons, government ministers, aristocrats, judges, newspaper editors, and arms traffickers,
*  all of whose trust he gained, all of whose private words he taped.
*  Biarejo was handcuffed and taken to Madrid, but as he sat in jail awaiting trial, the
*  question left hanging over Spain was this.
*  What happens to a country's secrets when they have all been recorded by one man, and
*  what happens when that man finds himself suddenly backed into a corner?
*  The answer, it seemed, came the next year, as tapes began leaking to the press.
*  There was the tape of Spain's then-justice minister, the woman overseeing the court system
*  that would try Biarejo, overheard using a slur for gay people.
*  There was the tape of the judge in Biarejo's case considering whether to grant a favor
*  to an arms dealer.
*  There were tapes of the former deputy leader of a major political party, of a bank executive,
*  of a prominent Spanish lawyer who was helping Julian Assange.
*  And there were the tapes about Juan Carlos I, Spain's former king.
*  The voice on the recordings wasn't the monarch's, but that of a former lover, Corina Tzuzayn
*  Wittgenstein, telling Biarejo of her disappointment in Juan Carlos.
*  For years, she said, he had been hiding money in Swiss bank accounts and
*  had secretly been given a penthouse by the Sultan of Oman.
*  He behaves like a five-year-old with his toys, she says.
*  Prosecutors soon opened corruption investigations against the former king.
*  As this all unfolded, Biarejo insisted that he'd had nothing to do with the leaks.
*  But he also warned, rather darkly, that he had been recording people for
*  decades and that only a small portion of his trove had been released.
*  Biarejo had become something akin to J. Edgar Hoover, the long-time FBI director
*  who kept damaging recordings of leftist activists and
*  powerful politicians for the purpose, sometimes explicit,
*  sometimes implicit, of blackmail.
*  But unlike Hoover, Biarejo had been arrested and
*  it seemed he was now using his tapes to attack the very state that was prosecuting him.
*  Adding to the mystery were the outlets where the leaks were published,
*  often small websites that appeared out of nowhere with blockbuster scoops.
*  As more tapes surfaced, many show new crimes Biarejo may have committed,
*  triggering additional investigations against him.
*  To many, it pointed to a bizarre possibility.
*  As Biarejo was leaking some of his tapes to bring down his enemies in the government,
*  they were leaking others to further incriminate him.
*  The problem for everyone is he recorded everything he was doing.
*  Alejandro Suarez, the owner of Moncloa.com,
*  one of the websites that published the leaks, told me,
*  at these lunches you can hear him going to the bathroom to pee and talking to himself in the urinal.
*  Then, early this year, there came another twist.
*  I received word from a man who wished to remain anonymous, a friend of Biarejo's, he said.
*  Biarejo had given few interviews since his arrest,
*  but the judge was nearing a verdict in his latest case,
*  and Biarejo feared he would go to jail for many years.
*  Before that happened, the man said, Biarejo wanted to tell his side of the story.
*  Did I want to meet Spain's most famous spy?
*  Biarejo suggested we meet at a steakhouse a short drive from his home on a cold day in January.
*  Without a disguise, he looks quite ordinary.
*  A portly 71-year-old with white stubble on his face, a bald head, and a baritone laugh.
*  He has a penchant for curse words and stories that end with off-color jokes.
*  But before we got very far into our conversation, I needed to interrupt him.
*  Are you recording us right now?
*  I asked.
*  His banter stopped and for a moment, he looked offended.
*  He wasn't recording me, he said, with the insistence of someone who had never
*  recorded someone without their previous consent.
*  In fact, he worried that he was being recorded by someone by way of a phone tap.
*  The idea seemed plausible, Biarejo has countless enemies in Spain, and
*  yet this kind of role reversal is exactly the thing you expect from a man who spent
*  his career trafficking in information.
*  When people call Biarejo the king of the sewers, el rey de las cloacas,
*  they're referring not to literal sewers, but to a shadow state or deep state that,
*  many say, has pulled lovers of power in the country since the time of Franco,
*  the nationalist dictator who took power in the same era as Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.
*  But unlike them, he ruled his country until 1975, and
*  a decades long dictatorship whose ghosts remain easy to spot to this day.
*  Franco's former mausoleum still overlooks the capital.
*  Spain's time zone remains an hour off from its original one because Franco
*  changed the clocks to match the hour in Nazi Germany.
*  Part of the reason dinner here often begins at 10 PM.
*  And then there are the so-called sewers, a network of current and former police
*  chiefs, intelligence officials, and military officials, all largely men of
*  Biarejo's generation, who grew up under the dictatorship and still wield power now.
*  It was among this crowd that Biarejo had been dubbed king.
*  I asked him what he thought of that title.
*  He shrugged, what people don't understand is that sewers don't generate the crap.
*  They clean the city, they take the crap away, he began.
*  Rome triumphed because it had good sewers.
*  He told me about a sanctuary in the Roman Forum,
*  the shrine of Venus Cloachina, built to celebrate the city's drainage system.
*  Sure, you go into certain places and you come out smelling bad, but
*  someone has to do this work.
*  And instead of punishing the guy who does this job,
*  we should think about thanking him.
*  The spy began recounting to me the long story of his life.
*  He was born in 1951 in the Andalusian town El Carpio,
*  a son of a pharmacist and a midwife.
*  Biarejo started his career in Franco's military during a time when conscription
*  was mandatory.
*  If the morality of fighting for a dictator weighed on him as a young man,
*  it certainly didn't show now.
*  He reminisced about Antonio Gonzales Pacheco, known as Billy the Kid,
*  a notorious police agent of the regime who later was charged with torture.
*  He was a great success, Biarejo said.
*  He joked about a failed coup d'etat in 1981,
*  attempted by right wing officers who burst into the Congress of Deputies with guns.
*  Biarejo was flipping through the decades like someone trying to find his place
*  in an old book.
*  I interjected to ask about his time as a soldier.
*  Why did he leave the military?
*  Biarejo took a deep breath.
*  He was a loyal soldier, he said, but the army was just not for him.
*  Since I was always rebellious, I could have been an anarchist.
*  But another side of me believed in order, discipline, and the fatherland.
*  I wanted to help my country, but I couldn't submit to the rules.
*  Unhappy as a soldier, Biarejo instead became an intelligence agent.
*  In the early 1970s, he joined the Social Investigation Brigade,
*  a branch of Franco's secret police charged with rooting out this loyalty.
*  Most often, the targets were leftist activists and
*  student leaders who were jailed for years.
*  Political opponents were silenced with blackmail,
*  fed by secrets delivered up from tapped phone lines.
*  Biarejo was at the center of these dark arts, and
*  he seemed to relish describing them to me in detail.
*  He recalled a somewhat cinematic incident from his undercover work against ETA,
*  involving a woman he met at a bar in the seaside city, San Sebastian.
*  One morning, while leaving her bedroom,
*  Biarejo said he ran into Iñaki Pérez Beotegui, who went by the alias Wilson,
*  a leader of the very group he had been pursuing.
*  At that moment, we both knew we were with the same woman,
*  Biarejo recalled, saying the men didn't exchange words.
*  The love triangle continued.
*  It was the 70s, he told me, as though this explained everything you needed to know.
*  And Biarejo began to press the woman for intelligence on her other boyfriend.
*  While this sort of 007 style intrigue was impossible to confirm decades later,
*  what was clear was that Biarejo seemed to live for it.
*  But that era was about to come to an end.
*  With his health declining, Franco announced that he had decided on a successor,
*  a Spanish royal who would be named King,
*  with powers akin to Franco's after the dictator's death.
*  The man was Juan Carlos.
*  In the end, Spain's new king-in-waiting didn't want to become an autocrat.
*  He saw a return to democracy in the offing, and after Franco's death,
*  Juan Carlos kept the title given to him, but began reforms.
*  Voters approved the constitution in 1978, and four years later,
*  the head of the Socialist Party, Felipe Gonzalez, became Prime Minister.
*  The changes did not bode well for Biarejo.
*  The new Prime Minister ordered a purge of Franco holdovers in the police.
*  Biarejo, who was head of the police union at the time,
*  was now on the outs as Spain sought a different way.
*  Biarejo finished his earth.
*  A sorbet he'd ordered along with an espresso.
*  He put on his hat and glasses, and we both stood up to go to the door.
*  But he asked me to sit down and wait for a few minutes alone, as he walked out first.
*  It was very likely that his former intelligence colleagues were following him, he said,
*  and he didn't want to be seen leaving with a journalist.
*  He added that I, too, should keep a low profile in the coming weeks,
*  because if I wanted to write about him, these same people would want to interfere.
*  You'll see, he said as he ducked out.
*  I know how these things work.
*  Remember that people called me the king of the sewers.
*  Before our next meeting, Biarejo sent me a copy of a letter that he wrote to a judge in his case.
*  It ran to more than 100 pages and was peppered with references to great thinkers of the past,
*  Sophocles, Da Vinci, Machiavelli, George Orwell,
*  and a 17th century Jesuit theologian named Hermann Pussenbaum.
*  It was, to say the least, a confusing read.
*  But throughout the letter, Biarejo hewed to a simple defense,
*  that while not completely innocent of the accusations against him,
*  he was operating in a system where his kind of espionage was long accepted.
*  He was a patriot, he declared, following the orders that he was given to protect the state.
*  If there was a problem, the problem wasn't with him, he argued,
*  it was with Spain itself, for letting Biarejo be Biarejo.
*  When next we met, it was at his lawyer's office in Madrid, on the fifth floor of a cream-colored building.
*  Biarejo and the lawyer stood up to greet me.
*  I started by asking Biarejo why he had wanted to do these interviews at all.
*  He thought for a moment.
*  He had been savaged by his enemies in public, he said,
*  to the point that he was now a boogeyman in the eyes of most Spaniards.
*  Now everyone knew his face, but no one knew him, and he wanted that to change.
*  He chose me, he added, because he could tell I was an honest man.
*  Such flattery must have opened many doors for him in the past.
*  I thanked him, but added that I needed him to be honest too.
*  Who is leaking your tapes? I asked.
*  Those tapes were taken from me by the police, he said.
*  Ask them.
*  I told him I found that hard to believe.
*  He was a spy, and spies kept copies of things in case they were taken.
*  Biarejo stared at me for a moment.
*  Well, he said, if he did have a copy, then it wouldn't be with him, it would be with a friend.
*  And the friend, he said, would need to be in another country,
*  and under very strict instructions not to release the tapes unless Biarejo personally traveled abroad,
*  to give him instructions to do so.
*  Because he wasn't allowed to leave the country currently,
*  there would be no way he could be behind the leaks.
*  We weren't getting far with the tapes.
*  Biarejo told me that after he left the police, he set up a private investigation firm.
*  One of his first accounts involved the Church of Scientology,
*  which Biarejo told me was worried about imposters using its branding without permission.
*  Biarejo sent investigators to take seminars offered by rogue Scientologists in various Spanish cities,
*  and Church lawyers followed up threatening legal action.
*  A 1990 article published in the Spanish newspaper ABC
*  mentions a trial in which Biarejo and Church members were accused of framing
*  one of the uncooperative Scientology imposters for a robbery
*  by coercing a recovering drug addict to falsely implicate him.
*  The group was later acquitted.
*  Scientology officials were so impressed by his work, he claimed,
*  that they flew him to Los Angeles to attend a gathering of top Church members,
*  where Biarejo says he briefly met John Travolta.
*  The Church of Scientology says it has no record of Biarejo attending such an event.
*  During the party, Biarejo told me he had tape rolling, as he always did.
*  Why though?
*  There was, he said, so much you missed in a conversation if you couldn't listen to it later.
*  The shades and nuances, they're all there in a recording.
*  The tonality, the timbre of the voice, he told me.
*  You can hear when they have doubts about the information they are telling you.
*  At first, he strapped large tape recorders to his chest.
*  But when micro-cassette devices became widely available in Spain,
*  he sneaked them inside his socks.
*  Finally, he just used his smartphone.
*  He recorded everyone, he said, a Moroccan general who was assigned to protect
*  the royal family, a husband looking for the bank account of a soon-to-be ex-wife.
*  At one point, Biarejo taped Montser Alcazar, a notorious Syrian arms trafficker living in Spain,
*  a recording that became part of an American federal court case against him.
*  I don't want some trap, the trafficker told Biarejo before the sting operation that caught him.
*  Yet mention Biarejo to anyone in Madrid, and there is only one set of recordings that they want to know about.
*  At one of our next meetings, I told Biarejo that I wanted to spend the morning talking about the tapes
*  concerning the former king, Juan Carlos.
*  He looked at his lawyer for a second, considering where to begin.
*  After a decade of working on his own as a freelancer, Biarejo said he got a call from Spanish officials.
*  They were asking him to go undercover again for the national police.
*  Once pushed aside by the government for being a member of sewers,
*  Biarejo was now back at the center of the intelligence establishment.
*  Biarejo folded his arms over his chest and looked in both directions,
*  the way one does before letting you in on a big secret.
*  In his last years as king, Biarejo said Juan Carlos fell in love with Corina Suzyne Wittgenstein,
*  a German-born Danish national who kept the name of her aristocratic ex-husband,
*  Prince Casimir of Seine Wittgenstein Seine.
*  She met Juan Carlos on a hunting trip in Spain.
*  The affair was an open secret, and before long, Juan Carlos told members of his circle
*  that he planned to divorce his wife, Queen Sofia, and marry Suzyne Wittgenstein.
*  Top officials at CNI, Spain's national intelligence service, were alarmed.
*  A divorce could seriously harm the reputation of the monarchy,
*  Spain's most traditional institution after the Roman Catholic Church.
*  According to Biarejo, intelligence agents devised a plan to break the couple up.
*  Nicknamed Operation Fari, after Farinelli, an Italian singer who, after being castrated,
*  became one of the most celebrated sopranos of the 18th century.
*  The plan was to do something similar to the king.
*  Military bodyguards were recruited to replace pills in his pill box with female hormones.
*  The idea, Biarejo said, was that the drugs would cause Juan Carlos's hair to fall out
*  and decrease his libido, such that neither the king nor his lover would find each other attractive.
*  I asked Biarejo to stop for a second.
*  It sounded like a ridiculous plan, I said.
*  How did he feel about it?
*  It all seemed wonderful, he said, laughing.
*  But then again, the king could have been poisoned.
*  CNI has never acknowledged that such an operation took place.
*  The couple eventually ended their relationship, though the breakups seemed to be more about
*  the king's inability to stay faithful to his mistress than the plot from the Spanish spies.
*  This, however, created a new headache for CNI.
*  The spy agency, Biarejo said, believed that Sue Sein-Wittgenstein had access to a trove
*  of damaging royal documents and intended to use them to blackmail her former lover.
*  So in the spring of 2015, Biarejo was dispatched once again.
*  This time he would go undercover to London to befriend Sue Sein-Wittgenstein with the
*  hope that she would tell him the location of the files and all that they contained.
*  Biarejo sought an introduction from a mutual friend, and
*  the two men met Sue Sein-Wittgenstein at her apartment in London's Eaton Square.
*  Biarejo said he asked for green tea, sat down, and established his cover.
*  He was a lawyer with deep connections to the intelligence community, but
*  unlike other officials, he felt she had been treated unfairly, and he wanted to help.
*  Biarejo told me that to help him gain her trust,
*  intelligence officials even sent him with documents to share with her that outline
*  plans by officials to frame Sue Sein-Wittgenstein for financial crimes.
*  When I listened to the tape of the conversation,
*  the leaked clips are now easy to find online.
*  I could hear Sue Sein-Wittgenstein shudder.
*  She then starts to tick off a list of dirty financial dealings she was aware of
*  during the relationship.
*  Juan Carlos kept hidden bank accounts in Switzerland, she said.
*  He had used one of his lawyers and a cousin as frontmen in numerous
*  transactions, including payments for private flights he took.
*  The king's advisors had tried to put a property given to him by the king of
*  Morocco under her name to shield him from tax payments.
*  And they started waging war against me because I didn't want to commit a crime,
*  she says.
*  Biarejo and Sue Sein-Wittgenstein met again the next year in London.
*  They ate at an Italian restaurant, and Biarejo said he broke his rule of not
*  drinking during operations when she bought a bottle of fine wine.
*  She said she had some love letters, but nothing amounting to an archive of
*  the king's secrets.
*  Biarejo kept pushing, but Sue Sein-Wittgenstein kept returning to her
*  frustration about her relationship with the former king.
*  She had truly wanted this man, Biarejo told me.
*  I think she was really in love with him.
*  Whether the former king's former lover really did have compromising documents
*  remains unknown.
*  But what's clear is this, the operation to protect the monarchy backfired in
*  2018 when the tapes began to leak and prosecutors opened multiple
*  investigations into the former king's activities, including for tax fraud.
*  In 2020, Juan Carlos I announced that he was abandoning his country.
*  Shortly after that, he turned up at the Emirates Palace Hotel in Abu Dhabi in
*  the United Arab Emirates, a fellow monarchy seen as unlikely to extradite him.
*  As I continued to report on Biarejo, I kept thinking of his parting words after
*  our first meeting near his home.
*  But having spent so long practicing the dark arts of intelligence in Spain,
*  he was certain that the country's powers that be would try to interfere with
*  the article about him that I was writing.
*  I dismissed it as bluster at the time.
*  I remembered a well-connected editor in Madrid telling me once that for
*  every truth Biarejo offered, he also had five lies.
*  Then came a message from Jose Bautista, my researcher in Madrid.
*  Someone had just sent him a file filled with dozens of unpublished
*  Biarejo audio recordings.
*  I had told Bautista that I was meeting with the spy, but
*  gave him strict orders not to tell anyone else, and he had kept to them.
*  I asked him who he thought had sent the files.
*  It wasn't clear, he said, but the source seemed to be someone close to Spain's
*  intelligence service who did not like Biarejo.
*  I hadn't contacted anyone in Spanish intelligence yet about the story.
*  It all seemed like a strange coincidence.
*  In the end, we found no blockbuster in the dump of recordings.
*  We listened to dozens of tapes, some just a few minutes in length,
*  others lasting for hours.
*  They were muffled, largely undated, and came with little context.
*  We weren't the first journalists to receive part of Biarejo's vast archive and
*  realize the fundamental truth about it.
*  He recorded everything, and much of it is of little interest.
*  The source had also sent a copy of a handwritten daily agenda,
*  Villarejos, with the names and dates for many meetings.
*  The agenda book was more useful,
*  offering a way to cross-reference many of the meetings Villarejo claimed to have had.
*  There was one part of Villarejo's tale that I couldn't seem to confirm anywhere.
*  Operation Fadi, the attempt to drug the king.
*  The plan seemed just too far-fetched, too much like the CIA's proposed plan to
*  repose Fidel Castro by first making his beard fall out.
*  The only person I knew who might have answers was Tzoo Sein Wittgenstein herself.
*  This April, after several requests, she agreed to meet, and I flew to London.
*  On a rainy Tuesday afternoon, she welcomed me into her house,
*  inviting me to sit at the same table where she met years before with Villarejo.
*  Her life was filled with legal battles now, she said.
*  She had testified in one of Villarejo's cases and
*  had her own lawsuit against Juan Carlos,
*  who she said had sent other intelligence officials to harass her.
*  The former head of the intelligence agency, Felix Sanz Rodan,
*  once threatened her and her children's lives, she said.
*  Sanz Rodan told me he didn't want to talk about it, but
*  told a court he hadn't threatened them.
*  Juan Carlos' personal lawyer, Javier Sanchez Junco,
*  told me of his client's ex-girlfriend that 99% of what she says is false.
*  He pointed out that Juan Carlos had settled his tax problems with
*  the Spanish government by paying back taxes and
*  all investigations against him there had been closed.
*  Finally, I asked her if she recalled anything about the king's hair falling out.
*  She did.
*  Juan Carlos, she said, was the first to suspect that someone was tampering with
*  his medication after the couple noticed that his face was starting to bloat.
*  Sue Sein Wittgenstein said she eventually flew a doctor in from France
*  to examine Juan Carlos.
*  The doctor also looked at his medicine box and found suspicious pills.
*  The couple had suspected Spain's intelligence agency was behind the plot,
*  but had no evidence that could prove it.
*  I asked how she felt about having been lied to by Villarejo.
*  She said it was a betrayal and
*  that she found it odd that so many in the country had all worked with the same dirty spy.
*  Villarejo shows that they're stuck in the modus operandi of Franco, she said.
*  It's still a shady world where nothing is what it appears to be.
*  It's crazy that this could happen in Europe in the 21st century.
*  In one of my last meetings with Villarejo in Madrid, I asked him how he was holding up.
*  He'd spent three years and four months in preventive detention before being released
*  in the spring of 2021.
*  The verdict he was awaiting from the trial last September,
*  which he assumed would not be in his favor, was on charges of bribery,
*  influence peddling, and disclosure of non-state secrets.
*  It could put him behind bars for as many as 20 years.
*  Villarejo had won some legal battles,
*  including a defamation case that went to trial in 2021.
*  And prosecutors have dropped a dozen other investigations.
*  But more than 30 investigations into additional allegations of bribery and
*  influence peddling, as well as embezzlement of public funds, falsifying documents,
*  criminal conspiracy, and threatening a dermatologist with a knife on behalf of
*  one of his clients, remain.
*  Villarejo could be defending himself the rest of his life.
*  For the moment, he said, he was spending most of his days back at home, meditating
*  and listening to Monteverdi and Baccarini.
*  I tried to imagine Villarejo meditating in a Spanish jail
*  at the end of a long prosecution.
*  I tried to imagine the investigators applauding themselves for
*  bringing him to justice.
*  But I couldn't see a system that had changed very much.
*  There was just an old man, an unreliable narrator, at best,
*  telling his story one last time, and one last attempt to use his secrets
*  to turn the course of events in his favor.
*  I thought again about the years of audio leaks that resulted from the police raid
*  long ago.
*  The attempt to bring down Villarejo, far from draining the sewer,
*  had simply caused it to overflow.
*  Now everyone could smell what was down there.
*  I looked up at Villarejo and asked him again, had he leaked the tapes?
*  I would be crazy to leak the tapes.
*  He said, but he didn't sound quite as convinced this time.
*  It had been a long day together.
*  Villarejo looked down at my recorders.
*  I used two of them in case one cut out.
*  He told me about times when his recorder failed and
*  he lost unrepeatable conversations with unrepeatable people.
*  He had recordings of Spain's prime minister, he said, of the handover of
*  the Spanish tuna vessel captured by Somali pirates.
*  Of, he trailed off.
*  I had heard this before.
*  He told me he hoped someone would get to listen to his full archive one day,
*  not just the leaked bits.
*  It is bigger than me, he said.
*  I met so many people.
*  It's my history there, the entire history of this country.
*  It's in there.
