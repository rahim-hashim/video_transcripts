*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro. This is the Daily.
*  Today, a crisis of confidence is brewing inside China, where the heavy hand of the government
*  is turning true believers in the Chinese dream into skeptics willing to flee the country.
*  My colleague, Lee Yu-E, on how that crisis is now showing up at the US-Mexico border.
*  It's Thursday, February 15th.
*  Lee Yu, right about China for the times, tell us how it is that you first came to this story.
*  I watched a lot of Chinese social media for my job.
*  In early 2023, I started saying something quite surprising for me.
*  I saw all these videos on social media of Chinese people crossing the US border with Mexico
*  by taking the route, what we call the Daring Gap.
*  Most people taking the Daring Gap are from Venezuela, Ecuador, and Haiti.
*  But what felt so unusual for Chinese people taking this journey is that, unlike these other groups,
*  these Chinese are fleeing the world's second largest economy.
*  Right. They are not in most of the public's imagination in the same boat as the migrants from any of the countries we think.
*  People are fleeing violence and poverty and taking this very dangerous route.
*  How many Chinese migrants are we talking about here?
*  Last year, in 2023, 24,000 Chinese crossed the southern border.
*  24,000?
*  Yes, that's more than the previous 10 years combined.
*  If we step back and look at the history, China used to be a big country for migration.
*  A lot of people were living very hard to live China in 1980s when China was a very poor country.
*  Then, as the economy grew, life became much better.
*  The opportunities were abundant and there were hundreds of millions of Chinese middle class.
*  By 2012, very few Chinese were living.
*  About 80% of Chinese who studied abroad, people like me went back to China because while they live China,
*  you could have Chinese dreams.
*  As a play on the American dream.
*  The American dream grew up watching Hollywood movies.
*  We all know the term and then the Communist Party kind of...
*  Co-opted the term and became the Chinese dream.
*  Many Chinese bought into that.
*  But in recent years, the numbers of people living China have again started to go up.
*  And actually, hundreds of thousands of Chinese citizens left the country last year.
*  And the Chinese migrants who crossed the Daring Gap represent those who are going to the most extreme lands to live the country.
*  And so, I've been really interested in finding out why are they doing this.
*  And what do you come to understand about why thousands of Chinese migrants are making this journey? What explains it?
*  It might be better if I can give you an example, a man, a man.
*  Hey, Gao Xianhe, you're welcome.
*  Hello.
*  His name is Gao Zhibing.
*  He's 39 years old.
*  And he saw take realized the Chinese dream and ended up on the Daring Gap.
*  He was born in China's Eastern province, Shandong, in a poor village.
*  He said he grew up having only two meals with meat a year.
*  And he didn't finish middle school.
*  He worked hard labor, making very little money.
*  But he dreamed about the world outside his village.
*  So he went to work at an electronics factory in Beijing, making about $300 a month, which was a fortune for him.
*  And he has a lot of street smarts.
*  You can sense it when you're talking to him.
*  So after a few years, he started working for kind of like a human resources company recruiting factory workers, just like him.
*  And then by 2007, he made some money.
*  And he released a plot of land on the offskirts of Beijing and apartment building and rented out to migrant workers.
*  So he basically becomes a small-scale, almost developer?
*  Yeah, a very small-scale developer.
*  And he did pretty well.
*  He was making about $30,000 a year, which was pretty good money for anybody in China at the time.
*  And he got married and he had a daughter.
*  And a few years later, he had a son.
*  He moved his parents from their village to Beijing, which was a big success in Chinese culture.
*  And he really believed he kind of made it.
*  And his life was only going to become better and better.
*  And what you're describing feels like a middle class existence in China's capital, a success story, not exactly the kind of person you would expect to leave China.
*  Yeah, the Chinese government likes talking about hundreds of millions of Chinese lifted out of poverty.
*  He was one of them.
*  But then in 2018, everything changed for Gao.
*  He got a notice from the local government that they wanted to take back the land he leased and tear down the apartment building he had built.
*  Yeah, the government wanted to use the land to sell it for big bucks to bigger developers.
*  Essentially, the government just wants to override the lease that he has for this land.
*  They just don't seem to respect it.
*  And they're putting up the sign and saying to him, it's over.
*  Yeah.
*  And the government ordered everyone in Gaos building to leave.
*  And Gao is like no way.
*  And he refused to leave.
*  But the government cut off the water, the power, and they throw away the tenants belongings on the street.
*  And they dumped toilet sewage in the yard because they wanted to make it unlivable for the people.
*  And then on that day, when the government came with police and bulldozers to tear the building down, he said he stood on the roof of the building.
*  He said he was so angry. His eyes just blacked out.
*  He had a break in his hand.
*  A break in his hand?
*  Yes, he wanted to throw it and fight the police, the government officials.
*  And his mom knelt down in front of him, begged him not to fight.
*  You can't fight the government. Just get over with it. Carry on with your life.
*  Cool. I am very sad. They have no idea how they can do it.
*  And he told me he just cried.
*  So what does Gao end up doing after the government takes away his land and this building?
*  Gao didn't want to give up. He decided to go to the higher authority of the central government to petition his case.
*  He thought at least he could demand some compensation for what he had lost.
*  But during that process, he said he and his family started getting harassed by local authorities.
*  They even went to his children's school to ask the students with the same last name Gao to stand up.
*  To stand up in the classroom?
*  Yeah, to intimidate, basically.
*  It got so bad that he legally divorced his wife to try to trick the authorities to stop harassing her and her parents.
*  And meanwhile, he had lost income from the apartment building.
*  He was trying to make a living doing all jobs.
*  And this went on for several years. And at the end of it, Gao got absolutely nothing in return for the loss of his property.
*  And at that time, he started to think about his world.
*  He said, I felt like I suddenly woke up.
*  He said, you know, he just found out there's no way to pursue justice in his country.
*  He told me, I felt like I finally saw through this country's reality, saw right through it.
*  I thought there was something that was not good.
*  Now, there's nothing good about it.
*  Everything is very bad.
*  His outlook for the country and for his own future just became very dark.
*  That was what he said.
*  So at this point, it seems safe to say that his version of the Chinese dream has collapsed.
*  And I wonder, as he's telling you this story, leave what you make of it.
*  To be honest, if you are China correspondent, you cover China, this is the type of story you hear again and again.
*  The space for the society just shrank so much in the past decade or so under the government of Xi Jinping.
*  It has become really hard for people from all kinds of social economic backgrounds.
*  You can get into trouble for anything, for being a wager, question, Muslim.
*  Where you're just ordinary online user, just making a comment on social media.
*  Where you're just a communist party cardry who has a copy of a band book.
*  And you can be in trouble.
*  The police can show up at the door in the middle of the night, the knock on the door.
*  And everything goes away.
*  You just live in constant fear.
*  And all of this are happening at the same time when the unemployment rate is rising.
*  And the Chinese economy is falling apart.
*  People just can say where their future is going to be.
*  The loss of confidence is you can feel it in the air. That's what people told me.
*  So this is the moment that the idea of the Chinese dream, you work very hard and the life will become better.
*  Kind of is clashing with the reality of the Chinese government.
*  And there's this moment that I saw the videos I saw on social media of people crossing the very gap.
*  And he saw to himself that I can do this too.
*  We'll be right back.
*  One scout decides to leave China.
*  Why does he decide to leave this way?
*  Why not go to a nearby neighboring country in Asia? Why not go to Europe?
*  Why travel across the ocean to the US through such a particularly terrifyingly dangerous route as the daring gap?
*  Yeah. For many Chinese people, you know, it's pretty obvious that the US is the country they should move to.
*  Because it is the wealthiest country in the world and the wages are much higher here than in most countries.
*  And also the US still looms large in the imagination of Chinese people, you know, for many people. The American dream never died.
*  The problem is it's not easy for ordinary Chinese people like Gao to get any kinds of face to go directly to the US.
*  But Chinese passport holders can fly directly to Ecuador without a visa. And from there, there's a well-traveled pass to the daring gap.
*  So many Chinese people just think that going from Ecuador to the daring gap is actually one of the best options for them to get to the United States.
*  But how aware is Gao of what is entailed in walking from Ecuador to the US border through that landscape?
*  He was aware of the danger.
*  He told me he knew that people died on the route.
*  But he told me his life was so risky, so dangerous, so uncertain in China.
*  He decided he might just as well leave to start a new life.
*  Gao had never been out of China and he didn't even have a passport. He applied for a passport after he decided to leave.
*  And he also convinced his family to let him bring his eldest child, his 13-year-old daughter to come with him.
*  And they left Beijing late February last year.
*  They flew to Turkey and then to Ecuador.
*  And Gao connected with Smugglers who took them to the daring gap.
*  It was such a brutal journey. Gao told me.
*  On the first day, he had some stroke.
*  On the second day, he could barely walk and his daughter vomited and fainted on the ground.
*  I asked him what was going through his mind during the journey. He said it was despair.
*  But he just told his daughter we have to keep going. We can't get left behind.
*  The journey took 35 days. They reached the border in late March and crossed from Mexico into Texas.
*  They were taken by border control agents.
*  Gao told his story about what his experience in China and he was let go.
*  This is where it feels like Gao's story seems to intersect with a very long-running story in the United States, which is what's going on at the border.
*  Thousands, tens of thousands a week.
*  Migrants showing up at that southern border seeking asylum.
*  And because there's such a backlog to process the applications, folks are let into the US and remain here.
*  That seems to be what happened to Gao and his daughter.
*  Yeah, Gao and his daughter, they were lucky. They were let go within 48 hours and immigration agents sent them to San Francisco.
*  And that's where he and his daughter have been ever since.
*  And what does his life look like in San Francisco?
*  So, Gao and his daughter are living in a studio apartment at the housing shelter there.
*  He got a work permit and has been working delivering packages for $2 per package.
*  He gets up at 6 a.m. every morning and his daughter has to get up around the same time
*  because she cannot be at the family shelter alone.
*  So, she would stay at the KFC until school time.
*  He worked really, really long hours.
*  And he told me he cries when he thinks about leaving her alone.
*  This was a very difficult existence. I mean, the kind of difficult existence that might make somebody wonder if they had made the right decision.
*  You know, life isn't easy for him and his daughter.
*  But Gao is focusing on what the US is giving him.
*  He said the Chinese government took away his building
*  and he can't believe the US government gave him an apartment to live for free.
*  One thing he emphasized is the freedom he has here.
*  He doesn't need to fear for the knock on the door anymore.
*  I asked him, are you idolizing the US too much?
*  And he kept telling me, no, no, no, I'd never regret it. My decision of coming here.
*  And he told me a story of when I was known in November when Xi Jinping was in San Francisco to meet with President Biden.
*  And Gao saw on social media that there would be a protest in San Francisco.
*  So he actually took the day off and went downtown.
*  He said he'd drawn a group of protesters and started chanting Xi Jinping's step down.
*  And he was actually interviewed by a Chinese media outlet at the scene.
*  He sent me the clip and the reporter asked him, why are you here?
*  He said freedom is great.
*  Then he shot it, longly freedom Xi Jinping stepped down.
*  He told me he felt amazing.
*  He said, in China, I wouldn't dare say that.
*  But this was hard-felt words. And I could finally shout them out.
*  Completely different person after that.
*  So what's the most likely outcome of this story for Gao? What do you think is going to happen to him?
*  So Gao applied for political asylum in May and he's waiting to say if it will be granted.
*  In the meantime, he dreams of one day settling down again in his own house, not in a shelter.
*  And he also wants to be reunited with his family.
*  Right, which of course, the majority, which is still back in China.
*  For now, he tells his wife that he will be able to get a green card soon, which he says is a lie.
*  In reality, he's not certain what will happen to him.
*  And you know, a lot of people like him who made a similar journey here, and he ended up going back to China.
*  When I talk to them, they said things are just too hard.
*  But Gao said even if he can make it here,
*  he will never go back to China as long as the Communist Party is in power.
*  Thank you, Mr. Gao.
*  Oh, thank you.
*  Okay. Bye-bye.
*  Bye-bye.
*  Gao would seem to be exactly the kind of person on paper that China wouldn't want to lose.
*  Somebody who made the journey that, as you said, China is so proud of from rural China to urban China,
*  who tried to create a business, a development, did so, brought his family to the big city,
*  and yet he'd rather risk his life and flee to the United States through the jungle than endure this version of China's government.
*  And based on your reporting, hundreds of thousands of others are doing the same thing.
*  And yet the reality is that China is a country of huge numbers.
*  Yeah.
*  One-point-fall-paling people.
*  Right.
*  So even if hundreds of thousands of Chinese people are leaving, that's still a pretty small proportion of the population.
*  So is what we're experiencing here, what you're documenting, a threat to China's future,
*  and something that it's going to be taking seriously, or is this just the cost of the authoritarian political model that China now has under she?
*  And can it therefore tolerate this outflow?
*  I don't think any country should take this lightly.
*  It is a serious problem for any government.
*  In the past year, I wrote about Chinese entrepreneurs, young professionals, intellectuals, artists, filmmakers,
*  all kinds of people, leaving because they couldn't suffer anymore.
*  There's even a term for that called Rinxue.
*  Running away from China is among the most popular passwords in China last year.
*  Everybody talks about where they should move to, what their options are.
*  My friends told me that it's also one of the hottest topics on dinner tables in China.
*  When people sit around and really get to talking, and they get into their cups, you're saying, they talk about fleeing.
*  Yeah, keep our obsessed with this.
*  I think what Gao and many people are doing is starting to look like a beginning of great exodus of China.
*  When the government became so harsh on its people, when the economy is not doing well,
*  and people can't vote for the leaders, some people decided there's only one way to vote.
*  That's where they're fit.
*  That was what Gao and many people did.
*  And I believe many more people are going to do that.
*  Oli, thank you very much, Ripper Ja.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Wednesday, a rocket fired from Lebanon struck a base in Israel,
*  killing an Israeli soldier and wounding eight others and prompting a massive response from the Israeli government.
*  Hours later, Israel carried out extensive airstrikes on southern Lebanon that killed at least four people.
*  The exchanges represent the kind of deadly tit for tat that could quickly spiral into a direct conflict between Israel and Lebanon,
*  which Israel has twice invaded in the past.
*  And a celebration of the Kansas City Chief's Super Bowl victory has turned into America's latest mass shooting.
*  One person was killed and at least 21 others were injured, nine of them, children.
*  Kansas City Police said they had detained three people in connection with the shooting, but offered few details and no motive.
*  Today's episode was produced by Stella Tan, Shannon Lim and Jessica Chowne.
*  It was edited by MJ Davis Lim with help from Michael Benoit and Paige Coway, contains original music by Mary and Luzano
*  Rowan Yamisto and Dan Powell, and was engineered by Chris Wood.
*  That's it for daily. I'm Michael Barrow. See you tomorrow.
