# Inside Ukraineâ€™s Drone Attacks on Russia
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Sg_kOg1Ebw)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverniisi, and this is The Daily.
*  As Ukraine's counteroffensive grinds on, it's increasingly turning to a secret drone
*  program that's hitting targets deep inside Russian territory.
*  Today, I talked to my colleague, Christian Trebert, about the origins of that program.
*  And to Sergey Pritula, a former television host in Ukraine, who is now a key force behind it.
*  It's Tuesday, September 19th.
*  Christian, welcome to the show.
*  Thank you very much for having me here.
*  So Christian, tell me about how you first came to investigate Ukraine's drone program.
*  So in early May, unverified footage appears to show an object flying toward the dome of
*  the Kremlin before bursting into flames.
*  The whole world was in shock because these two drones attacked the Kremlin.
*  Tonight, there's a mystery in Moscow, the Kremlin accusing Ukraine of launching drone
*  attacks.
*  It was a killing President Vladimir Putin.
*  Ukraine denies it.
*  And it was kind of like unthinkable.
*  Of course, the Russian invasion, full-scale invasion of Ukraine had been going on for
*  over a year.
*  But suddenly, like two drones exploding above the Kremlin was like, wow, they're hitting
*  where Putin is in the heart of Moscow.
*  It was wild.
*  Does Ukraine have drones that could reach the Kremlin, five, 600 miles from the Ukrainian
*  border?
*  It was surprising because Ukraine doesn't have equipment that does that, right?
*  So it was sort of like, wait, is this someone inside Russia doing this, a Kremlin attack?
*  Who is this?
*  Exactly.
*  And that was the big question.
*  Like, who is responsible for this?
*  And how could they pull off an attack like this?
*  Because Moscow is hundreds of miles away from the Ukrainian border.
*  So was it someone inside Russia?
*  Was it Ukraine with some secret weapon?
*  So I'm part of a team called Visual Investigations.
*  And basically, what we're doing is trying to find any visual clue that we can find.
*  Think of a satellite image.
*  Think of a TikTok video, security camera footage.
*  Think of official statements, you name it, to piece together what's going on.
*  And we try to do that with this attack.
*  There was security camera footage of those drones, one exploding and one seemingly hitting
*  one of the domes of the Kremlin.
*  So we're like, OK, it's kind of grainy footage, but frame by frame, can we measure the wingspan?
*  Can we match it to something that we have seen before?
*  And we couldn't really find a match.
*  It was a mystery.
*  It was an absolute mystery, yeah.
*  And so then what happened?
*  So as we're looking into this, me and my colleagues, right, I get a text message.
*  And it's like, hey, Christian, long time no speak.
*  Would you like to know more about these drones that hit the Kremlin?
*  Wait, who's the text message from?
*  It's a person that I've known for a long time, haven't been in contact for years.
*  Turns out to be this person that texted me is in this homegrown do-it-yourself long-range
*  drone program.
*  Basically, a secret weapons program that's building a drone that can hit the Kremlin.
*  And I get a photo of kind of like funky looking drone.
*  And I'm like, wow, this is interesting.
*  I got to see what this is about.
*  So what did you do?
*  We started chatting, we started talking mostly on signal, but it's very secretive, right?
*  And for that reason, people are extremely careful to talk about it.
*  Right, they don't want to become a target.
*  Exactly.
*  So it seemed the best way for me to better understand it was to just go to Ukraine to
*  see some of these drones, to talk to the people involved in it in person.
*  So I go to Ukraine, I meet my source, and I try to meet as many people more like one
*  leads to another.
*  And what I start to understand is that it's just not one person or one company or one
*  government agency building one single drone.
*  It's multiple entities within the government, outside of the government, private companies
*  that are all kind of racing to build a drone that can hit the Kremlin, that can cover that
*  long distance.
*  And we're talking here about very specific type of drone.
*  On the one hand, it's long range, so it can really cover those long distances, for example,
*  from the Ukrainian border, hundreds of miles to the Russian capital, Moscow.
*  And secondly, these drones are one way and one use, meaning they take off, they fly towards
*  their target, and then they explode on target.
*  And that's it.
*  That's the lifespan of the drone.
*  So kamikaze.
*  Exactly.
*  And this is a pretty novel technology.
*  Ukraine wasn't known to have this.
*  Very little countries around the world actually are known to have this technology because
*  it's pretty hard, right?
*  You need to build something that flies for hundreds of miles and can then also carry
*  a payload and needs to navigate through air defenses, electronic warfare, you name it.
*  And what did you learn about how Ukraine managed to develop this technology that so few countries
*  have?
*  I mean, I don't think of Ukraine as, you know, cutting edge military technology place.
*  So it all started in mid October last year.
*  And that's when Russia started hitting Kiev and other Ukrainian cities with kamikaze drones
*  that they had bought from Iran.
*  Today we woke up to the sound of explosions in Kiev as the Russians launched a massive
*  drone attack against this city.
*  Kiev says fragments of this drone shot down in southern Ukraine have Iranian as well as
*  Russian markings.
*  These are the type of weapons that the U.S. and other Western nations allied with Ukraine
*  are not willing to give to Kiev because they're worried that Kiev will use those weapons sooner
*  or later to indeed strike inside Russia with whatever the consequences may be if you use
*  Western weapons to strike Moscow, for example.
*  Right.
*  And they don't want to give the Ukrainians stuff to make these things because that could
*  prompt Ukrainians actually striking the Kremlin and the Kremlin pushing the nuclear button.
*  Right.
*  So because of that worry, because the West not willing to give those weapons to Ukraine,
*  Ukrainians were like, OK, we'll have to build them ourselves.
*  So they got together basically anyone that has some idea of like, how do we build a drone
*  and scrambled together to build this capacity themselves.
*  But it takes, of course, some time.
*  They start repurposing reconnaissance drones that are not intended to explode or to fly
*  and hit a target.
*  And it seems like they're just trying to reach Moscow because here and there we see like
*  posts on Telegram and Russian small villages and communities where they just find a drone
*  which we identified as being Ukrainian made in a forest.
*  I was being told by one of the people involved in the drone program, you know, sometimes
*  we hit a tree or a power line.
*  So it doesn't really work or has the intended effect yet.
*  But then they also start asking publicly for money.
*  Volunteer fundraisers start saying, hey, you know, we want to raise money for a long range
*  striking capability for Ukraine.
*  OK, so it wasn't actually going that well.
*  They're starting to repurpose things.
*  The things hit trees, not going very far.
*  They need money.
*  And it reaches this kind of fundraising stage.
*  Right.
*  Probably but surely it seems they're stepping up their game.
*  The Ukrainians are actually reaching a point where they can reach Moscow.
*  And that's when the strike on the Kremlin happens.
*  Right.
*  The strike that launched you on this reporting journey in the first place.
*  That's right.
*  And it was very clear it wasn't a lucky shot because that same month, multiple drones hit
*  Moscow.
*  And what are we talking about, Christian, in terms of the numbers of these strikes?
*  What does your reporting say?
*  Well, where we saw like just like a handful in late 2022, late last year, we've seen the
*  amount of attacks double in the past three months alone.
*  Wow.
*  So it's really increasing a lot.
*  Like I talked to one of these drone developers and he sent me a video.
*  And this video shows one of the drones currently under production.
*  And it has these very like significant sounds.
*  Like it's sometimes called like a flowing lawnmower.
*  It's very like the kind of scary sound.
*  I get that video and signal with the comment, this is going to be the number one hit track
*  in Moscow this fall.
*  Yeah, I mean, that sound, right?
*  It is terrifying.
*  I mean, I've been in conflict zones where I've heard the sound of a drone.
*  I didn't know what it was immediately, but I learned over time.
*  And it's this sound that makes you feel like you are a tiny ant and there is a foot above
*  you about to crush you.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think it's a big part of why Ukraine is launching these long range drones into
*  Russia because indeed that sound, imagine being woken up in Moscow and you hear that
*  sound and you're not sure what's going on.
*  It happens again and again and again.
*  And someone told me, let them feel the war.
*  If you support the occupation and the invasion of Ukraine, you should not be able to feel
*  safe.
*  OK, so it's scary.
*  It might be rattling people in Russia, but is it meaningful militarily?
*  Like has this program claimed credit for significant damages or killed anyone in Russian territory?
*  So far it hasn't killed anyone yet.
*  But I think we shouldn't underestimate what those drones have already done and could do
*  in the future because we have seen in Peskov, which is pretty far away from Ukraine at a
*  military air base, they were able to destroy two very expensive cargo aircraft of the Russian
*  Air Force and damage to others.
*  And besides hitting military targets like that, they've also hit infrastructure like
*  oil depots, oil storage sites.
*  And this, of course, could affect the Russian military logistically when they're sending
*  new troops into Ukraine.
*  But besides that, Russia also needs to make decisions.
*  Hey, are we going to place our fancy air defense unit in the suburbs of Moscow and replace
*  it from Ukraine?
*  And these are strategic decisions Russia needs to make.
*  And that could affect also the battlefield in Ukraine, of course.
*  Oh, interesting.
*  So we have this fancy air defense stuff.
*  It's in Ukraine now.
*  That's where we're fighting the war.
*  But whoa, maybe we need to bring it to Russia, which in itself would be an acknowledgment
*  that holy moly, something's going wrong, right?
*  Absolutely.
*  Because it is a hard choice for Russia probably to make, right?
*  Because are you going to defend your capital city, including the house of the president,
*  and including a very important military air base that clearly right now don't have full
*  protection from these drones?
*  Or are you going to leave it in Ukraine?
*  What I understand from talking with sources in Ukraine's military intelligence agency,
*  this is indeed what they're hoping to do, force Russia to make hard decisions where
*  to deploy their air defenses.
*  And Christian, what's the big picture here?
*  Like, what do we think the ultimate effect is?
*  I mean, I remember our colleague Mike Schwartz, you know, I called him when I first started
*  seeing these drones and I said, what's going on here?
*  I mean, is this important?
*  And he said, you know, one thing is for sure.
*  This war will not end until it reaches Moscow.
*  Is that what we're looking at here?
*  Time will tell.
*  But I think it's such a new thing to see that these Ukrainian drones are hitting Moscow,
*  hitting Moscow now repeatedly and hitting military targets repeatedly.
*  And with it seemingly only to increase, we may seem that there is more pressure on Russian
*  civilians, but also on Russian elites that are still close to Putin that will feel worried.
*  Like, wait, can it hit my house?
*  Would they target my house?
*  And I think instilling that fear may create some change around people that are closer
*  to Putin.
*  So you went to Ukraine, you found this nascent drone program that was largely built from
*  scratch, and you watched as it became more and more effective.
*  And it's all based on this ingenuity and scrappiness that the Ukrainians have really by dint of
*  necessity, right?
*  That's all they got.
*  But of course, that same scrappiness comes with its own risk.
*  When a program like this is cobbled together, totally ad hoc, using private donations,
*  individual donations, funneled through multiple channels, things can get pretty messy pretty
*  quickly.
*  Like, maybe the money stops flowing, maybe people get greedy.
*  There's a lot that can go wrong.
*  How do you see the program at this point?
*  Yeah, I think there's these different kind of groups that are all building different
*  And they're even maybe competing a little bit with each other sometime.
*  There are two intelligence agencies in Ukraine.
*  We know the military intelligence agency launches their drone into Russia.
*  But now the internal intelligence agency also announced they have a long range drone.
*  So the equivalent of the Ukrainian FBI is developing its own program, even though the
*  CIA already has one that hit Russia.
*  Right.
*  But then outside of the government, you also have these private individuals and companies
*  They're also all trying to develop their drones.
*  And sometimes it went to a point that they don't really even communicate with each other,
*  are not really aware of each other, what they're doing.
*  And production needs to be rammed up if they really want to continuously hit Russia.
*  Because Russia is adapting.
*  Each time one of those drones is down, Russia can look at the technology inside and say,
*  OK, we need to make maybe adaptations in our air defense here and there.
*  So each time Ukraine needs to step up their game and they need to basically have a larger
*  capacity of these drones.
*  And the question will be, are they able to ramp up production like that?
*  And what is that a question of?
*  It's mostly, it seems, a question of money.
*  And right now, most of that money is coming from this hodgepodge group of volunteer fundraisers.
*  People that had little, if anything, to do with the military before the war started.
*  Social media influencers, comics.
*  People who had basically zero idea of what a kamikaze drone was.
*  And now they're at the center of this drone war.
*  After the break, we talk to one of the main figures behind Ukraine's emerging drone program.
*  Hi.
*  Hi, you hear me?
*  You see me?
*  Hi.
*  Yes.
*  OK, so I'm Maria.
*  Nice to meet you.
*  Hi, Maria.
*  Nice to meet you.
*  Sereniy will be here in a couple of minutes, two minutes.
*  He just went for some quick call.
*  We are now in our main office where all the meetings, all the fundraising activities are
*  happening with a beautiful map of Ukraine.
*  A small tour of our museum.
*  Oh, look at the museum.
*  Yeah, this is called Brush and Corner.
*  What is it?
*  Hi.
*  You know this guy, right?
*  Hi, guys.
*  Hi, nice to meet you.
*  So we go into the room in a couple of minutes and we'll start, OK?
*  Great, great.
*  OK.
*  My name is Serhii Pertula.
*  I'm 42 years old.
*  I'm staying in Kiev right now.
*  And I'm an owner of one of the biggest charity foundations in Ukraine.
*  Your colleague Maria was just showing me around and she showed me a corner where there were
*  some weapons collected there.
*  Tell me about that.
*  She showed you a Russian corner, we call him.
*  That's like a little museum that we have here in our office.
*  It's a place with a lot of trophies that our military bring to our foundation.
*  Trophies like downed pieces of Russian planes?
*  Pieces of Russian jets and Russian helicopters.
*  We have some devices from tanks, like to say thank you for your help, guys.
*  Right.
*  So that's your Russian corner.
*  Tell me what's on your t-shirt.
*  I'm not sure that it's a good idea to answer your question because that means some bad
*  words.
*  It's like we wish them to die.
*  Serhii, let me go back for a minute.
*  Where did you grow up?
*  Where was that?
*  What was it like?
*  I was born in Soviet Union.
*  I grew up in 1980s in a small village in the west part of Ukraine and that was time when
*  we had no FM radio stations, when we had no YouTube, we had no Spotify or something like
*  that.
*  But that was time when in Soviet Union was not popular to speak Ukrainian language because
*  that's the language of village people.
*  Right.
*  That is not a very prestigious thing, fancy thing to be speaking Ukrainian, right?
*  Russian was the language everybody should be speaking in Ukraine.
*  If you wanted to build a good career, you need to speak Russian language.
*  So I'm thankful to my grandma and my grandpa who teach me to read, to write, to count and
*  also to sing Ukrainian songs.
*  And after that, Soviet Union collapsed when I was 10 years old.
*  I started to be a student in 1997 in Ternopil and I started to work on radio station when
*  I was 17 years old.
*  That was what I loved so much.
*  And after that, we had the Orange Revolution in Kiev, in our capital.
*  Hundreds of thousands of pro-democracy Ukrainians in the streets today protested against the
*  results of the presidential election.
*  And I moved to the capital on this revolution.
*  That was time that I loved because many people start to speak Ukrainian, you know, and they
*  start to love this city more and more.
*  I find some friends here and they invite me to work on big TV channel.
*  And I start to be a TV presenter of morning show on TV show.
*  What was that TV show called?
*  Wake Up.
*  Appropriately named.
*  Yep.
*  That was my time of rising when everybody in Ukraine starts to know who I am because
*  I was those guys who helped them to wake up every day and who told them that you are the
*  best people in the world and I wish you good luck.
*  But I was a TV presenter in dozens of different shows.
*  Like maybe you have also in the United States, we call it Battle of Sexes.
*  But not today.
*  Team on the stage!
*  I was one of the most popular Ukrainian speaking TV hosts in time when mostly managers on TV
*  channels, they were looking for Russian speaking presenters.
*  And that's why I created my own comedy show Varyaty Show.
*  That was first 100% Ukrainian speaking comedy show in Ukraine.
*  And my son when he was maybe six years old, he asked me once, dad, do you have some super
*  power?
*  Because he was a fan of Iron Man.
*  And I started to understand that now is a serious situation.
*  I don't want to disappoint my son.
*  And I said to my son, I have a superpower and I want to show you my superpower.
*  And I take my son with me to other city where I have my show with my colleagues.
*  And I told my son, look, what do you see?
*  He said many people.
*  I said, yes, there's more than a thousand people and they all are different.
*  Men, women, young, old, rich, poor, with good education, without education.
*  Some of them drive cars, some of them take bus to be on our show.
*  But now I want to show you my superpower.
*  And I made some jokes and 1000 different people start laughing in one moment.
*  And I just turned my head to my son and asked him, so do you understand which superpower
*  I have?
*  And he was so impressed that his father can do some magic with 1000 different people.
*  I can do in one moment altogether.
*  But it was enough for me that I'm also a cool man like Iron Man.
*  Yep, I try my best for my kids.
*  They are also a big motivation for me to do my job here in our foundation better every
*  day because I miss them and I want them to come back to our apartments where I feel
*  myself absolutely broken because I'm alone.
*  Where are they now?
*  In a more safe place.
*  And also I understand that our foundation, all work that we do here to support our military,
*  that makes Russian secret services also not happy.
*  Right.
*  Interested in your location and your foundation, right?
*  Yes.
*  And that's why it's also about to protect my kids because it's really dangerous for
*  them to stay with me in Kiev.
*  Sergei, tell me about Russia and your relationship with Russia.
*  One year and a half ago when Russia started full-scale invasion, I shoot a video where
*  I called to Russian TV stars, pop stars, because I know dozens and dozens of them by myself.
*  I said, please, you have millions and millions of followers in your social media.
*  You have dozens of millions of people of your audience who love you and who trust you and
*  your army killing your audience in Ukraine.
*  People who bring you money and people who applaud you on your shows.
*  And if you will call your people to stop this invasion.
*  Or shut up.
*  But no one said stop this war.
*  And what did you make of that?
*  Just forget about them and start to do my job what I can do better.
*  I like to unite people to try to organize people with some crime finding campaigns to
*  raise money and to help destroy Russian troops.
*  And the motto of our foundation is invincible when united.
*  So you set up a foundation.
*  Can you tell me about the moment that you started raising money for the drones?
*  Okay, so there was a situation in October last year.
*  My wife visited me in Kiev and in the window of our apartment, she just watched like Russian
*  missile destroyed house 200 meters from our home.
*  And she was afraid and we run to the bomb shelter.
*  And I was sitting there and I read in Facebook and in Twitter, thousands and thousands Ukrainians,
*  they were in fury because Russia attacked Ukraine with dozens and dozens of missiles.
*  That was a terrible day in our history.
*  And people were so angry with this Russian attack.
*  What were you feeling?
*  That's a hard question because many different things you think during missiles destroyed
*  your city because one missile was exactly a few meters from kindergarten where my daughter
*  was.
*  But that's not at this moment, but she will never visit this kindergarten is destroyed.
*  So that's some emotions like, of course, you're afraid because I want to be sincere with you.
*  It's really, it's really bad emotion when you understand that next missile can kill
*  you and your wife.
*  And of course, I was angry with myself because you can do nothing.
*  You have no power to protect your city.
*  Your family.
*  Yes.
*  And you're angry also with all our partners from abroad because they are so slowly with
*  air defense systems.
*  And our partners support us and we're really thankful for all help that we have.
*  Thanks for all tanks, APCs, guns, everything else, artillery systems.
*  But it's not enough because we have a war with Russia.
*  So after that, you're trying to find some way how to what you can do at this moment.
*  So we start crowdfunding campaign.
*  And how did you do it?
*  Was it just something you put on Facebook or what was it?
*  Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube.
*  And we raised a little bit less, 10 million USD in one day.
*  You raised 10 million US dollars in one day.
*  A little bit less, maybe 9.6.
*  And we call this campaign for revenge.
*  Yes, we tell people that we will find some way how to revenge.
*  And that's why we choose drones with long range.
*  And we bought big UAVs, kamikaze also.
*  That's like one way ticket to Russians.
*  Did you have any previous experience with drones, Sergey?
*  Anything in your normal civilian life that would have brought you in contact with them?
*  Of course not.
*  No, no, no, sorry, once during my wedding, there was a cameraman, but not with camera,
*  but with drone.
*  So he filmed our wedding party with drones.
*  So that was only one of my experiences.
*  That was your experience.
*  Yes.
*  But if you want to survive, you will develop your skills.
*  No one here in my foundation had no such experience like we start to have after full scale invasion.
*  I have architectors here.
*  I have guys from IT business also.
*  I'm a TV presenter.
*  I didn't know one year and a half ago that I will raise more than 130 million dollars
*  in the next one year and a half.
*  But that's a total war and we need to do everything we can to support our soldiers.
*  Sergey, I guess I'm curious what you think is the most important role that long range
*  drones are playing right now.
*  Like is the objective to destroy buildings or even kill people?
*  Mostly drones don't kill people.
*  They destroy some infrastructure buildings or some military objects.
*  I heard maybe you heard also a few days ago in Russian city Pskov, four big Russian jets
*  were burning.
*  I don't know how it happened.
*  Maybe someone smoked in the not right place.
*  But some people told me that maybe it was happened because of drones attack.
*  Yes.
*  I myself, Sergey, wrote a news headline about that.
*  And the news headline I wrote was that drones struck in many regions of Russia overnight.
*  Yeah.
*  Hitting and destroying four large aircraft in the Pskov region.
*  So we said it was underscoring the Ukrainians ability to reach deep inside Russia with the
*  war effort.
*  Deeper and deeper.
*  It's really very important Russians to start feel the same emotions like Ukrainians.
*  If you will stay in Bob shelter every night with your kids, maybe you will ask some questions
*  to your government.
*  Maybe.
*  So is part of the power of these long range drones that you're able to take this war to
*  Russia and possibly awaken them to this war as you were unsuccessfully trying to do when
*  you were trying to appeal to Russian celebrities?
*  Yep.
*  To send the message to Russian society that two can play this game.
*  Have you seen any signs that it's working?
*  That the drones are breaking through to Russians in this way?
*  Yes, of course.
*  We are searching Russian media or telegram channels and we find information that everything
*  work.
*  Everything work meaning the drones that you funded hit their targets?
*  Yes.
*  The drones that hit in Pskov, were those the drones that you funded?
*  I didn't tell you nothing about Pskov and about our drones.
*  But just believe me that I'm happy how our military use our drones that we bought after
*  the Kremlin-Farming campaign for revenge.
*  Look, I'm a citizen of Ukraine.
*  I want to live in a better country.
*  I want to come back to my previous life.
*  I want my family back to Ukraine.
*  I want my people to stop dying with this war.
*  That's why that's not my choice.
*  That's my duty to do everything that I can do till the victory day.
*  And I will do it.
*  People will fight.
*  This unity is still strong.
*  That's Ukrainian superpower to organize ourselves.
*  We will never forget and never forgive.
*  Ukraine's president, Vladimir Zelensky, arrives in the United States today, his second trip
*  since Russia invaded last year.
*  He will attend the UN General Assembly in New York and then will travel to Washington,
*  where he will meet with congressional leaders and with President Biden to lobby for military aid.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that, quote, agents of the government
*  of India carried out the killing of a Sikh community leader in British Columbia in June.
*  The leader, Hardip Singh Nijar, a strong supporter of an independent Sikh homeland, was gunned
*  down on June 18th outside a Sikh cultural center.
*  Speaking in the House of Commons, Trudeau said that he raised India's involvement directly
*  with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Group of 20 summit earlier this month.
*  He said the allegation was based on intelligence gathered by the Canadian government.
*  And five Americans who'd been imprisoned in Iran were allowed to leave the country on
*  Monday after two years of high-stakes negotiations.
*  In exchange, the United States agreed to unfreeze $6 billion in Iranian oil revenue and to dismiss
*  federal charges against five Iranians accused of violating U.S. sanctions.
*  The announcement came as President Joe Biden and President Ibrahim Raisi of Iran were scheduled
*  to attend the annual UN General Assembly meeting of world leaders on Tuesday.
*  Today's episode was produced by Lindsay Garrison, Mary Wilson, and Claire Tennis-Sketter.
