# The Metamorphosis of Pete Hegseth
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLDHkdnV4XM)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Now that Matt Gaetz has withdrawn from consideration as attorney general, Donald Trump's most
*  controversial cabinet pick is his selection of Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense.
*  Today, my colleague Dave Phillips on the three major diplomats that shaped how Hegseth views
*  the military and why, if confirmed, he's so dead set on disrupting its leadership.
*  It's Tuesday, November 26th.
*  Dave, welcome back.
*  It's been a long time for me since we've last spoken, and it's nice to see your face.
*  Oh, you too.
*  So Dave, when it comes to the subject of what we're going to be talking about today,
*  Donald Trump's pick for secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, what's probably best known about
*  him at this point is that he faces a very serious accusation of sexual assault, which
*  we will return to within this conversation.
*  And on top of that, that he lacks the traditional background for becoming secretary of defense.
*  His latest job was as a Fox News host.
*  But what's less well understood is what exactly he thinks about the United States military,
*  which he may soon command, based on his own experience as a member of the armed forces.
*  And you have been trying to figure that out.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the big question for me.
*  If he gets the job, what does he want to do and why?
*  And the reason I ask is he does not have a lot of traditional Washington experience.
*  He spent almost 20 years in uniform and he deployed three times.
*  He's been to Iraq, he's been to Afghanistan.
*  But most of his experience is just leaving small groups of troops on the ground.
*  He's never worked in the Pentagon.
*  He doesn't have a lot of time at big defense contractors.
*  So he doesn't have some of the traditional experience that's normally the road to this
*  type of job.
*  And that's important because if he is confirmed, he's going to have to manage nearly three
*  million employees and an annual budget of almost a trillion dollars.
*  Well, tell us about those deployments.
*  And I guess going back even further, how and why Hexeth went into the military and how
*  taken together all those views are likely to shape the kind of defense department he
*  would lead.
*  So he grew up in Minnesota, has a very traditional church growing conservative childhood.
*  And then he goes to Princeton University.
*  And there too, he's kind of an outspoken conservative.
*  In fact, he joins the university conservative political journal, which is called the Princeton
*  Tory and writes a lot of really provocative essays, sort of taking on the issues of the
*  day.
*  Modern feminism, homosexuality, and he's really hard right on a lot of this stuff.
*  And he arrives there in 1999.
*  So while all of this is going on, the attacks of September 11th happened.
*  And so another hot political topic that comes right up to the top is how does America respond
*  to that stuff?
*  And he really becomes outspoken in support of military intervention, not just in Afghanistan,
*  but also in Iraq.
*  And it should be said that this is not just academic because halfway through his college
*  career, he joined ROTC.
*  And as soon as he graduated from Princeton in 2003, he became an army officer.
*  So he knew he could be going to war, but he had faith that that was the right thing to
*  do.
*  So he's very much aligned, it would seem with the Republican leadership of the United States
*  in that era.
*  I was in college during this period too.
*  George W. Bush, and he is making the case for war and asking as many Americans as are
*  willing to sign up and do the patriotic thing and bring the war that had come to the United
*  States on September 11th back to the places where those attacks allegedly began.
*  That's right.
*  So he puts on a uniform as a national guardsman and he gets sent to Guantanamo Bay.
*  And remind us what's happening at Guantanamo Bay at this early stage in those two wars,
*  Afghanistan and Iraq.
*  So at this point in 2004, the prison there is only about two years old.
*  It's been very hastily set up as a place to store terror suspects until the military can
*  figure out what to do with them.
*  And the idea is that the military is going to set up a commission and they are going
*  to charge and prosecute these folks and very quickly reach outcomes, probably convictions,
*  and it'll be dealt with.
*  And Pete Hagseth is kind of a low level administrator.
*  He's a platoon leader, but also does a lot of paperwork, spends a lot of time at a desk.
*  And later he describes this deployment as a long boring duty.
*  In fact, I think the only thing that happened that's noteworthy to him is that he saw a
*  lack of action.
*  What do you mean?
*  Well, here's this prison that's been set up to deal with all these suspects, some of whom
*  are very dangerous.
*  And what he sees is not convictions.
*  He sees the process going from swift to slow to essentially a standstill.
*  Remember there were hundreds of terror suspects there at the time.
*  Almost none of them ever went to trial.
*  So here we are almost 20 years later and nothing's happened.
*  And if you're Pete Hagseth, if you're somebody motivated as he was to sign up after September
*  11th to avenge this horrible act that has killed more than 3,000 Americans, being there
*  on the ground and knowing that just over those walls is a process that's grinding and not
*  really going anywhere is probably very frustrating.
*  Yeah.
*  Here's a died in the world believer who volunteered and put on the uniform to help and nothing's
*  happening.
*  Very frustrating.
*  And I think he goes home kind of disappointed.
*  Dave, you mentioned multiple deployments.
*  So where does Hagseth end up next after Guantanamo?
*  Yeah.
*  So he comes back from Guantanamo feeling like he didn't necessarily achieve very much and
*  he's watching the news and this is 2005.
*  And so Iraq, which was supposed to be an easy and quick victory by that point is really
*  falling apart.
*  And he feels like again, here's a chance for him to step in and help.
*  And so he volunteers and he joins the 101st Airborne Division as a infantry platoon leader
*  and he goes to Iraq.
*  And what's his experience there?
*  He arrives on the ground in what is essentially a mess that's getting worse every day.
*  What had been a relatively swift invasion is now curdled into sectarian fighting, into
*  roadside bombs everywhere, into mounting American casualties.
*  And the infantry troops that are on the ground like him, they're supposed to fix it.
*  And he realizes how difficult that's going to be because he's getting some very conflicting
*  instructions.
*  What's an example of that?
*  So lawyers in the army who are giving a briefing to him and all the soldiers that he's arriving
*  with tell him essentially, hey, look, the rules are very strict.
*  You cannot fire on an Iraqi even if you see them with a rocket launcher unless that rocket
*  launcher is actually pointed at you.
*  On the other side is some of the leadership in his brigade, combat commanders who are
*  saying you should expect to fire on pretty much any military-aged male and you don't
*  even need to give warning shots.
*  So he's got some people saying don't fire until it's too late.
*  Some people say fire way too soon and he's a young infantry guy who's leading 40 soldiers
*  who are trying to figure this out.
*  And whose advice does he ultimately take?
*  What is his conduct?
*  This is really interesting.
*  He took a very moderate and measured approach.
*  He's like, okay, we're just going to be really careful.
*  We don't want to shoot anyone.
*  We don't need to because that's just going to make us so many more enemies in a war that
*  we're trying to end.
*  Not only did he tell his soldiers, hey, we're not going to shoot unless we're sure, but
*  he volunteered to be the first one through the door on raids they would go on because
*  he didn't want to put that really difficult decision in the hands of some 21, 22-year-old
*  soldier who might make a rash decision.
*  People who served with him that I interviewed say he was flawless, careful, cared about
*  what he did and his soldiers loved him for it.
*  But something happens right after he leaves his infantry company.
*  There's a big operation.
*  It's called Iron Triangle.
*  And his infantry company, not his platoon specifically, but other platoons that are
*  in this same little military group, are going after an insurgent target and they end up
*  shooting some civilians and executing some captives.
*  They were charged with crimes because in the military, if you go beyond the rules of engagement
*  and kill someone who shouldn't be killed and you're definitely not allowed to kill captives,
*  that's murder.
*  At the time, Pete Hegseth was really clear-eyed about how he felt about this.
*  This will become important later in his career, but he was very outspoken saying, this is
*  wrong, it's not the right way to do things, and he called it atrocities.
*  And made clear that those are lines that you can't cross not just because they're lines,
*  but because they're deeply counterproductive.
*  Yeah, he becomes a big believer during his time in Iraq in what the military calls counterinsurgency,
*  which is a fancy word for rather than shooting the Iraqis, let's help them rebuild their
*  society.
*  It's stuff like sewer systems, electrical, setting up a city council so that cities can
*  And he worked daily on those projects and had a lot of success.
*  By the time he came home from Iraq in 2006, he was a huge believer in counterinsurgency.
*  He's going on TV, he's speaking in panels, he's making a public case that, hey, we need
*  to double down on this strategy.
*  The strategy we're pursuing now, a counterinsurgency strategy implemented by General David Petraeus,
*  is finally the right strategy to be using in that country.
*  At the time, America was kind of souring on Iraq, people were talking about pulling out,
*  and he very clearly said no.
*  We stood up Iraqi armies, we held national elections, and all of those things are incredible.
*  We need more troops there, but we need to do it right.
*  Not only did I see security forces that were stronger, but I sat in on a city council meeting
*  where I watched 18 members of the Samara City Council debate for four hours, issues like
*  electricity, water, sewage, rebuilding of civic buildings.
*  Let's do counterinsurgency, help these people rebuild, and in doing so, we will help ourselves
*  because we will create a stable nation that will no longer be a breeding ground for violence.
*  So as a pretty low ranking veteran of the war in Iraq, he somehow finds himself on TV
*  advocating for specific approaches to these wars.
*  Yeah, because he comes with a perspective of a Joe in uniform who has real ground combat
*  experience.
*  And he's saying, look, I've seen these efforts work.
*  Let's double down on this.
*  When he's such a believer, he volunteers for a third time in 2011, this time to Afghanistan.
*  And when he gets there, he's doing what he's advocating for.
*  His job is to be a teacher at a counterinsurgency school where he will teach these methods to
*  the officers of the Afghan army.
*  But unfortunately, his timing there is a lot like his timing in Guantanamo.
*  He's getting there right when the situation is twisting towards dysfunction.
*  By 2012, the United States military has decided it's going to pull out of Afghanistan, slowly
*  but surely.
*  And one of the first turnovers that happens is that Pete Hagseth turns over his counterinsurgency
*  school to the Afghan government.
*  And this effort that he's worked very hard on, within a year or two, it falls apart.
*  Right. Which, of course, becomes a metaphor for the entire conflict in Afghanistan, because
*  by the end, the Taliban will return, take over American bases, take over American mess
*  halls and tanks and equipment, and turn the entire U.S. war there into an exercise in
*  futility.
*  Right.
*  And so that's Pete Hagseth's final deployment.
*  So in three deployments, he's seen three different flavors of Pentagon dysfunction.
*  And so pretty much his entire adult life has been spent on this effort that has come to
*  nothing.
*  And in fact, the only thing that he really has seen the military very expeditiously and
*  successfully do is you remember those folks that I said were in his infantry company that
*  got charged with war crimes.
*  I do.
*  They were very quickly tried and convicted.
*  And so he saw successful prosecutions against his own guys, guys that had been put in very,
*  very difficult positions.
*  But he had never seen any successful prosecutions against the people who were detained at Guantanamo.
*  His front seat at all of this dysfunction really left him in bitter.
*  He started out as a patriot who wanted to join the effort.
*  And he left feeling like the people leading the military did not know what they were doing.
*  Right.
*  And the only people who he saw being held accountable through any kind of process were
*  his own guys being punished by their own government.
*  That's right.
*  In the years afterwards, his experience really distills into a view where he's deeply supportive
*  of the people who went and tried to make things work in Iraq and Afghanistan and deeply,
*  deeply distrustful of the leadership that made it all fall apart.
*  And that informs his views as his platform becomes bigger and bigger.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Dave, what does this bigger platform for Pete Hegs's views of the military look like
*  in the years after he leaves the service?
*  So he starts working for Washington, D.C. based veterans groups that push for all sorts
*  of stuff, continued involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, better care for vets through
*  the VA.
*  As part of that advocacy, he's repeatedly appearing on TV.
*  And I think it becomes pretty clear by about 2014 that he's good at TV.
*  The troops have not been a priority of the left.
*  They are not a priority of the left.
*  Do you think that the Pentagon is becoming too politically correct?
*  Well, it certainly is not helpful if we've got a military trying more to be politically
*  correct than the biggest, baddest military in the world.
*  Better ideas in and of themselves don't inevitably carry the day.
*  Ultimately, big guns and courageous people who carry them are the ones who carry the
*  day.
*  And right now, at this point, let's ask our Fox News contributor, Pete Hegsath.
*  Hey, Pete, good morning.
*  Good morning.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  He gets his first official position with Fox News as a part time contributor.
*  And he starts getting more and more time.
*  He becomes a presenter.
*  He eventually becomes a weekend host.
*  And his time at Fox is a real mix of what he was doing at Princeton years before, sort
*  of like provocative culture war type of conservative stuff and speaking out for veterans.
*  You think women should not be in combat roles, correct?
*  Because I think inevitably the standards will eventually be eroded by bureaucrats or by political
*  He talks about getting women out of combat roles in the military.
*  He complains about how woke ism has taken over the general core.
*  You know, a lot of the leaders are DEI hires.
*  In that case, you're not improving war fighting capability necessarily.
*  You feel better about yourself.
*  And this is a story we've covered extensively on this program.
*  Many of our nation's warriors are finding themselves in trouble for doing the job they
*  were hired to do.
*  Fight a war and kill the enemy.
*  He does something he's never really done before, which is speaking out on behalf of soldiers
*  and other service members who have been charged with war crimes.
*  As a warfighter, you assume that your military will have your back.
*  Instead, they come after you.
*  Absolutely.
*  Always framed in like, hey, this was a good person trying to do their job and in the fog
*  of war, forced to make a split second decision.
*  They did the wrong thing.
*  And now the military is trying to hang them for it.
*  And that's not fair.
*  What is the biggest charge you may face?
*  And what is the lightest charge you face?
*  There's only one charge and that's premeditated murder.
*  It started out with an army green beret named Matt Goldstein, who'd been accused of executing
*  a suspected Taliban bomb maker.
*  And it grew to include...
*  Clint Lawrence, brand new platoon leader, orders his platoon to fire on the men in
*  the motorcycle.
*  They're killed.
*  He's charged with murder because there's no weapons found on those individuals.
*  Young lieutenant named Clint Lawrence, who had been convicted of shooting civilians in
*  Afghanistan.
*  Well, let's right now bring in for his first exclusive interview Navy SEAL operations chief,
*  Eddie Gallagher, his wife.
*  And probably the best known is Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher, who'd been turned in by his own
*  platoon for allegedly shooting at women and children in Iraq and executing a captive.
*  Right.
*  And Dave, this is a story that you have told several times on our show as the saga of Eddie
*  Gallagher has played out.
*  Yeah, this was the first time that Pete Hagseth came across my radar because he was inviting
*  these people on, people whose cases I had written about.
*  And honestly, I looked at it pretty dumbfounded because I can absolutely understand the idea
*  of, hey, I'm going to stand by the ground troops and give them the benefit of the doubt.
*  But what really complicates that is that in a number of these cases, these folks had been
*  turned in by their own platoon.
*  The people who understood the fog of war and the situation on the ground more than anyone
*  else had looked at what had happened and been like, man, that's messed up and had turned
*  them in.
*  Right.
*  In other words, they had crossed lines in the eyes of those who were on the ground with
*  them.
*  And Pete Hagseth doesn't seem interested in those nuances.
*  In his mind, it's kind of like America right or wrong.
*  And I refuse to accept that they did anything wrong.
*  Right.
*  The interesting thing about that is he knows all about these nuances because he's been
*  a lieutenant leading ground troops in Iraq and he has seen his own guys be prosecuted
*  for this stuff.
*  And at the time before he was on Fox, he said very clearly, hey, this is wrong.
*  It hurts us more than it helps us.
*  But fast forward to when he's on Fox and that's no longer the case.
*  Well, how do you account for that change?
*  In your reporting, you seem to find very clear evidence that Hagseth, when the idea of these
*  war crimes first emerges, is very unsympathetic to those who have allegedly committed them.
*  Now all of a sudden, he's not interested in the nuances and he basically just wants to
*  make sure these guys get off scot-free.
*  Yeah, I think that three deployments just made him lose so much faith and so much trust
*  in the Pentagon that he no longer believed that the leadership could make good decisions
*  or fair decisions towards the people on the ground.
*  CNN has learned that a Fox News host encouraged President Trump to consider pardons for some
*  military members accused of war crimes.
*  So Hagseth and President Trump basically become a two-man military court.
*  They're not war criminals.
*  They're warriors who have now been accused of certain things that are under review.
*  Where he puts the cases up and Trump makes the decisions.
*  News tonight, President Trump pardons two soldiers with connections to Fort Bragg.
*  Major Matthew Goldstein, who you see there on the left, accused of killing a suspected
*  bomb maker who was not a legal threat.
*  Now Lawrence was released Friday from the U.S. military prison, Fort Leavenworth in
*  Kansas.
*  Tonight, President Trump intervening again to defend embattled Navy SEAL chief Eddie
*  Gallagher, saying he will not let the Navy strip Gallagher of his status as a SEAL.
*  I stuck up for three great warriors against the deep state.
*  So what clearly starts to take form here is a partnership, a direct pipeline between Hagseth
*  and Trump.
*  And I suppose you have to add on top of that the fact that Hagseth's view of post-911
*  U.S. interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan, his disillusionment with them is very much
*  shared by Trump, who is so openly disdainful of how the U.S. military leadership and even
*  civilian elected leadership entered those wars and conducted those wars.
*  So it does not seem at all like a surprise that Hagseth would be his choice to be a senior
*  figure in the military, the Secretary of Defense.
*  Well and remember during Trump's first term, he clashed repeatedly with various generals
*  who were in his administration, including Secretary James Mattis, who now hates President
*  Trump, called him unfit to be president.
*  And so President Trump and Pete Hagseth both share this disdain for the military establishment.
*  And so when Trump looks around for someone who shares his view and can act, who has some
*  military experience but is also deeply mistrustful of the military, Pete Hagseth is his natural
*  choice.
*  But what has become clear in the days since Trump picked Hagseth to be his Secretary of
*  Defense is that neither Trump nor those around him seemed to know about some of the alleged
*  problematic personal conduct that Hagseth engaged in since becoming a Fox News host.
*  That's right.
*  There's some episodes that really call into question his judgment.
*  He actually had a baby with a producer in 2017, a Fox News producer, while he was married.
*  That same year, he was accused of sexual assault by a woman who he had sex with at a conservative
*  political convention in California.
*  Police investigated.
*  They didn't file charges.
*  He says it was consensual.
*  But a few years later, he paid her an undisclosed amount of money as part of a settlement over
*  this.
*  In addition, during President Biden's inauguration, Pete Hagseth was removed from what would have
*  essentially been a security detail there because another person in his National Guard unit
*  who had seen some of his tattoos wrote a letter to the command saying, hey, these tattoos
*  are related to white supremacy and Christian nationalism.
*  And this guy, Pete Hagseth, may be an insider threat.
*  And so he was removed from that detail.
*  Now, a couple of years later, actually this year, Pete Hagseth left the National Guard.
*  But he has said publicly, like, I was forced out over that, essentially.
*  Like, they pulled me out of that.
*  He feels he was targeted and it was unfair.
*  But all this to say that there are a number of things that really are raising eyebrows
*  about this guy who could be in charge of the entire military.
*  Right.
*  And for all those reasons, we don't know if Pete Hagseth is going to make it through the
*  Senate confirmation process that lies before him in the next couple of weeks.
*  Like Matt Gaetz, he could end up having to drop out because of accusations of sexual
*  misconduct.
*  But so far, Senate Republicans who have met with Hagseth on Capitol Hill seem to be optimistic
*  that he could make it through.
*  And for the sake of argument, let's act as if Pete Hagseth does become secretary of defense.
*  How transformational would that be for the U.S. military to have someone who clearly
*  sees himself as such a champion of the soldier and such a challenger to the military establishment?
*  What do we think?
*  You know, I think it really depends.
*  On Fox, he's this culture war bomb thrower who talks about getting rid of all women in
*  combat positions, which, you know, there are thousands of people that might affect.
*  So it's unclear how things like that could actually happen without being completely disruptive.
*  You know, on the other hand, when he was in uniform, everybody I talked to said he was
*  just a hardworking, nonpartisan, common sense guy.
*  So are you going to get a mix of the partisan bomb thrower and the common sense officer?
*  Are you going to get one or the other?
*  I think that's up in the air.
*  It's clear that in the rank and file, there is some recognition that for the past 25 years,
*  the status quo hasn't really been working and they're hungry for change.
*  Right.
*  And that would seem to be what Donald Trump is banking on here, that for too long, even
*  in his own first administration, his recipe of self-disruption stopped at the military.
*  He never thought to put someone like this in that role.
*  Right.
*  And he's rolling the dice that not only it will work, but that it has to work.
*  That this is a place that does need that kind of disruption.
*  No more generals, no more admirals.
*  He's putting in someone who's, you know, top line on their resume for the job is that I
*  don't trust the people that have been running this.
*  And so he's all but promising disruption.
*  Well, Dave, thank you very much.
*  Appreciate it.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to another day.
*  On Monday, as expected, special counsel Jack Smith dropped his indictments charging Donald
*  Trump with plotting to overturn the 2020 election and illegally retaining classified documents.
*  Smith in court filings explained that longstanding Justice Department policy makes it impossible
*  to pursue prosecutions against a sitting president.
*  Smith wrote the decision to drop the cases, quote, does not turn on the gravity of the
*  crimes charged, the strength of the government's proof or the merits of the prosecution, which
*  the government, he wrote, stands fully behind.
*  In a post on social media reacting to the news, Trump called both indictments, quote,
*  empty and lawless.
