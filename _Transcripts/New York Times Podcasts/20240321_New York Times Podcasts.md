*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  The tournament games for college basketball begin this week, and the star this year is
*  a woman who is changing everything about the game, from the way it's played to its economics
*  and who is watching.
*  Today, my colleague Matt Flaganheimer, on the extraordinary phenomenon of Caitlin Clark,
*  the trail she is blazing in women's sports, and whether it will last.
*  It's Thursday, March 21st.
*  Matt, welcome to the show.
*  Thank you so much.
*  And welcome to March Madness.
*  Welcome to March Madness, America.
*  Here we go.
*  So, Matt, the NCAA basketball tournament starts this week, and the biggest star this year is a woman,
*  Caitlin Clark. She's someone who even a year ago was not a household name,
*  but here we are, devoting an entire daily episode of Dirt.
*  So, for the uninitiated, tell me why.
*  Well, Caitlin Clark is the most famous college basketball player in America.
*  She's a senior at the University of Iowa. She is 22 years old, and she has become this sort of
*  electric phenomenon.
*  She's selling out arenas, and really being this sort of master of ceremonies at every game that she's
*  in. There is a quality to her when you walk into the arena. You know that she is the person
*  that everyone has come to see. Every camera has pointed at her, every cell phone has pointed at her,
*  every fan is watching her warm up.
*  If any sort of mundane activity happens on the court, she grabs a rebound, she's getting a pass.
*  There's this sort of anxious hush.
*  Like there's just this quality of, you don't know what's going to happen next.
*  And beyond being a sports story, the story of Caitlin Clark is really about this kind of broader
*  cultural phenomenon and really speaks to sea change in the way that women's sports are being consumed.
*  So, this really reminds me of when I was in high school in the 1980s in Massachusetts,
*  and there was this player Larry Bird, who played for the Boston Celtics, and he was just electric,
*  and everybody wanted to watch this guy play. I mean, he drew me into a game I
*  ordinarily probably would not have been interested in because he was such a good player,
*  and he was Massachusetts, you know, who is my team? And it sounds like this is something that
*  Caitlin Clark is now doing for women's basketball. So tell me about her. How did she begin? What's her story?
*  Caitlin Clark has this kind of sports movie origin story.
*  And her story is something she's talked about quite a bit in interviews, in her post-game press conferences.
*  So I'm an Iowa kid. I grew up here. I grew up rooting for the hot guys.
*  Christopher begins in Iowa in West of Moin, about two hours from the University campus.
*  We're definitely a sports family more than anything. She's from a family of athletes.
*  She has two brothers. I was super competitive, so I think that kind of like fueled me and wanted
*  to play sports, especially basketball. She has this hyper competitive streak that her family has
*  talked about from an early age. Her brother needs, you know, staples in his head after a
*  nerf game, goes sideways. There's this sense that she's really wired a certain way.
*  I honestly started playing sports with boys before girls. And she really starts to play with the
*  boys, both in her family and otherwise. I won like league MVP one year and like parents were mad.
*  They're like, this is a boys league. How can a girl be the MVP?
*  And she's, you know, shooting hoops in the driveway. Eventually her range becomes so
*  extensive that her dad has to take some grass out of the lawn to make more driveway so she can
*  shoot from further away. She also has role models. Maya Moore. She's like my first ever WMBA
*  game. I actually met her, which is. And Maya Moore, she has this story she likes to tell,
*  I'm of seeing her play. All I ever wanted to do is meet her. I didn't have a phone
*  so I just ran over, gave her hug ran away. It's like the most vivid memory I have of like women's
*  basketball growing up. And so to seize herself following that tradition.
*  And then as a teenager, she becomes enough of a sort of buzzed about basketball player that
*  even some really prominent national figures like Kevin Durant, the men's basketball player,
*  start to notice her. And she winds up committing to the University of Iowa, staying in her home state.
*  And it was immediately clear that the program, which you know, I think was,
*  Tina's like a solid program, not necessarily a perennial powerhouse was going to be seen
*  in a different way with somebody like Caitlin on the roster. So the team was okay and suddenly it
*  was getting this incredible player. This incredible player, this sort of generational talent.
*  And somebody who coaches have talked about really having to bridle is the word that they use.
*  As if she were a racehorse, something that they had to sort of figure out how to make
*  exist in a team context. Okay, bridle is an interesting word. What about her specifically was
*  different than other players on the team? She just had talents that not a lot of players had.
*  And her coaches and teammates have talked about her own expectations of herself being so high
*  that sometimes her expectations of her teammates were such that she could be disappointed if they
*  bubbled a pass that she threw it that they didn't expect. If they missed a shot off of some
*  pass of hers, if the coaches did something that she didn't necessarily think was wise. So there was
*  this sort of a learning curve for her and for the team and her coaches for how to best channel all
*  of that in a team setting. This part she fires, it goes! She hit it! But certainly the talent was
*  cleared. She was a leading scorer as a freshman. She was taking these long three pointers from
*  all over the court. There's a logo at Mid-Court in Iowa that's a sort of Hawkeye beak.
*  And she's taking shots from the edge of the beak. Ah, in other words, from very far out, right?
*  From very far out, with this just boundless shooting range, you know, pulling up from places on the
*  court that most players wouldn't conceive of shooting from and consistently making shots and having
*  a defense need to sort of account for her so far away from the basket creates room for other players
*  to operate. Okay, so when does she go to stratospheric fame with that? So in last year's NCA
*  tournament, March Madness, round after round, she's just carrying Iowa with these spectacular viral
*  moments, these incredible passes with a roster that's not necessarily considered a real powerhouse
*  in the tournament. And it's compelling to watch. Obviously seeing somebody shoot from that far,
*  seeing somebody carry a team like that, beating teams that maybe seems more formidable that Iowa,
*  and the attention grows. She acquires a nickname at the time, Ponytail Pete, after Pete Maribitch,
*  who was an incredible college basketball player and professional in the 60s and 70s. He did not have
*  a ponytail. He did not have a ponytail. He had pretty shaggy hairy, maybe could have had a ponytail
*  if he wanted to. And has this really spectacular run all the way to the final four where they face
*  off against South Carolina, seen as the best team in the country, undefeated to that point. I was a
*  big underdog, and on the strength, really largely of Caitlin's brilliance on the court, they went.
*  They defeat the sort of Goliath they go to the championship game, and really nobody saw them
*  getting that far. And an Arsenal championship game is underway. So what happens in that final game?
*  So in that final game, it's Iowa against LSU. Louisiana State. Louisiana State, which is another
*  really compelling cast of characters with the loaded roster headline by Angel Reese, their star player.
*  Angel Reese gorgeous delivery inside. A really colorful coach, Kim Mokey.
*  Smart awareness by LSU on these mismatches in the post. And it does sort of pit these two
*  programs against each other, two really compelling casts of players and supporting characters
*  meeting in this epic final. It's a very competitive game back and forth, and it's a dude by almost
*  10 million people, which is a far-run away record for a woman's final. Really not that far off
*  from the bench final. And they see a good game. It's not down to the wire to the very end,
*  necessarily a competitive game, but it's not quite enough. They lose.
*  But the story doesn't necessarily end there.
*  Uh, Lindsay with USA State again. Caitlin, can you tell us at the end of the game what happened,
*  there's a lot blown up on Twitter about Angel Reese following you around?
*  In the days afterwards, there is this sort of controversy around Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark.
*  Essentially over a celebration that Caitlin Clark had done previously in the tournament
*  that was sort of putting her hand in her face. It's called the you can't see me kind of taunting
*  that sort of amounts to trash talk on the court. So she's basically saying, ha ha.
*  She's saying, ha ha with her hands. Yeah, okay. And with the scoreboard at the time.
*  And then in the final when LSU was pulling away, Angel Reese does the same gesture at Clark
*  and is very clearly kind of taunting. Clark, as I was about to lose and have their tournament run
*  she was obnoxious. Yes, she was obnoxious. Keith Overman said on the comments of this
*  this was his comments on a young woman who is in college winning a championship. What an
*  effing but spelled out the word idiot. The difference in the fallout is that Angel Reese who
*  was black faced quite a bit of criticism for this taunting the sense that it was on sportsman
*  I'm too hood. I'm too ghetto. You know, I told me that all year. But when other people do it,
*  y'all say nothing. And Caitlin Clark who was white had not really faced any of that.
*  So there was this sense of a double standard. In the coverage of this, there was this
*  real momentum to kind of pit the two of them against each other as these two stars of the sport,
*  one white, one black, and Caitlin Clark was not so interested in any of that.
*  I don't think Angel should be criticized at all. And you know, says she has nothing but respect
*  for Angel Reese. Loves how she plays, loves her game. Competition is good. I think everybody
*  knew there was going to be a little trash shock in the entire tournament. It's not just me and Angel
*  across any sport. That's how it should be. So she says, men trash talk all the time. And
*  why should this be any different? You know, you should be able to play with that emotion. That's
*  how I'm going to continue to play. That's how every girl should continue to play. So
*  and ultimately this becomes a sort of long tail of the final itself. You had this moment with
*  these incredible ratings for the game. And then you had this kind of secondary moment of this
*  pseudo controversy. And all of it is drawing eyeballs to him as basketball in a way that hadn't
*  really happened in the decades that had been around. And even for people who don't follow basketball,
*  right? I mean, I had heard about it around that time probably precisely for that reason.
*  Absolutely. You had people who had never watched Katelyn Clark play a minute of basketball,
*  assuming the story in a new way. So really was this time last year taken together the tournament
*  experience and this sort of post-mortem. The Katelyn Clark becomes more than a basketball player.
*  She becomes a national figure on a very different scale.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Matt, you just told me that Katelyn Clark at the end of last season really went from being
*  a basketball player in the state of Iowa to something much bigger, something really on the national
*  stage. Tell me about that. So see, I merged with some last season with a whole new profile. A lot
*  of new fans, a lot of new attention. And in this sort of fluke of historical timing, Katelyn Clark's
*  college career is coming along at a time when there is this massive shift happening in college
*  prior to 2021, college athletes could not make money off of their name, image, and likeness.
*  Now that's a possibility. So that combined with being an extremely effective narrator of her
*  own story, she's becoming extremely famous in a time when becoming extremely famous as a college
*  athlete is very lucrative business. So okay, this translates to sponsors and advertisers.
*  Presumably they come calling. They do. Quite a few of them.
*  Iowa's Katelyn Clark now has her own brand of cereal on high.
*  So Clark is the latest athlete to join Nike's lineup. She's among the
*  sorts of sponsors who associate with professional players.
*  Shoot. Shoot. Okay, I'll shoot. What's happening? But I don't see any who.
*  No, I state farm. If we can draw fifty six thousand fans, you can draw fifty seven.
*  Gatorade. If I can sign with Gatorade, you can too.
*  But these are not, you know, local car dealerships. These are major national.
*  This is not. She's obviously huge in Iowa, but these are national brands who come calling and
*  who stay very much a part of the picture.
*  So by the time her senior season starts for 23-24, I mean, this thing is often running.
*  The first sell out in the history of the women's program here at Northwestern, of course,
*  the big draw. I went to a couple of games both at home and on the road.
*  Been packed, mostly the entire day. And that's because of this line that formed here.
*  It is stretching. I think I've heard about a quarter mile around the building.
*  And it's just a rock concert everywhere.
*  Let's go Katelyn Clark. I got to be like Caitlin.
*  A lot of kids with signs, you know, I want to be like Kate, they're wearing her jersey.
*  He definitely changed the game for the better and even just changed the world.
*  But so we're, you know, a lot of like grown men.
*  People are driving hours to see her. They're selling out arenas.
*  Over 52,000 tickets have been sold.
*  Not a single empty seat with crowds flocking to see Iowa Hawkeyes star, Katelyn Clark.
*  Secondary ticket prices for resale are going for like $400, $500. It's really become
*  kind of the hottest thing in town. And celebrities are going to Iowa City to watch college basketball.
*  And there is this really kind of breakthrough cultural power.
*  And she knows this. She knows she's being consumed in this way.
*  And she'll file away little scenes that she takes in. There was a game at Iowa that I was at.
*  There was this girl.
*  It was cute. She was like copying our stretching warm enough.
*  So I thought it was like a door while she was doing like like swing swing stuff before the game.
*  So she files that away. They play the game. She plays great. They win.
*  She goes up to the girl and gives her the shoes that she'd worn for the game.
*  What is the little girl too? She actually, I mean, she's, she's beaming.
*  That, that is probably the most special moment that has ever happened.
*  You know, something easy I can make her day and I'm sure she loved this. That's cool.
*  But Katelyn has sort of talked about that being her experience as a fan of that age too.
*  And it really keeps going.
*  Here comes Clark. How will she go for history?
*  She's essentially breaking a new record every few games. She has the most points of anybody
*  to ever play on the women's side. Eventually it's the men's record.
*  Either men or women nobody is scored more points playing college basketball in division one
*  than Caitlyn Clark. Wow. It's quite something. The record she broke on the men's side
*  was held by Pete Merovich to whom she was compared last year. So it's a lot of history that she's
*  transcending. And you see the sport itself start to reap some of the benefits of this new
*  found attention. The television contract for the women's tournament value the tournament at $65
*  million annually, which was a many fold increase over the last contract. There is a sense the ratings
*  will persist. And she's also not the only player in the country now getting a lot of attention.
*  There are great players throughout the college game, including Angel Reese,
*  Ju-Ju-Wakkins, who's a freshman at USC, who are really frankly bigger stars than any men's
*  college basketball player right now. This doesn't just begin and end with Caitlyn.
*  And it won't end for college sports when she leaves. Obviously, Caitlyn Clark will not be
*  the college basketball player forever, but she helped drive attention to the sport. And there is
*  a hope that they can sustain itself after she's gone. So this tremendously popular college
*  player is really kind of blowing up the sport economically and culturally. But as you say,
*  she's not going to be in college forever. At some point, she's going to graduate.
*  She will. So she faces this choice. Despite being a senior, there was this allowance given to
*  athletes during COVID to stay for an extra year. So really all year she's faced this choice.
*  People will have asked her about it constantly. Will she go back to school for a fifth season?
*  Or will she turn pro? But Matt, why wouldn't she go pro? I mean, isn't it every athlete's
*  aspiration and goal to go pro? I mean, she's getting a ton of attention, selling out stadiums. Like,
*  why would going pro even be a question? Yeah, if she were a male college athlete playing basketball,
*  this might be a lot more straightforward. The best players in college on the men's side tend to go
*  pro at the first opportunity. There is money to be made. There are eyeballs in the NBA. On the
*  women's side, the WMBA, the professional basketball league for women. And it's just a very
*  different thing. It's a league that has gotten far fewer viewers than women's college basketball.
*  It is a league that doesn't have the attendance of the games that Caitlin Clark has been playing in
*  at Iowa. And for some context, there were more than 9 million people, almost 10 million people who
*  watched the National Championship game, the Caitlin Clark played in last year. The college tournament,
*  the WMBA finals last year for the professional league were viewed by under a million people.
*  So we're talking about a fraction, a tenth. So much less. So much less. And Caitlin Clark is not
*  making a kind of formal salary as a player in college, but her stature does afford her a kind of profile
*  that has made these sponsorships possible that has made her any potential pretty stratospheric.
*  And it's hard to say if that will translate in a league where the viewership is not the same,
*  you know, being the biggest star in college basketball at the moment affords you a bigger platform
*  than being the biggest star in the WMBA. It's just not consumed in the same way that college sports has
*  been. And why is that met? There's a couple of reasons. There is this kind of tribal quality
*  to college sports fandom. You know, you go to a school, you become a fan of the school, you live
*  in an area, you become a fan of that team. The WMBA is such a young league. It's, you know,
*  barely older than Caitlin Clark is. There hasn't necessarily been that same attachment formed to the
*  teams. And despite a lot of really passionate fans and some improvements in attention over the years,
*  there was the Olympic team having women's basketball in 1996. There was the onset of the WMBA,
*  obviously, there have been moments with stars in the league like a Maya Mord and a Tarasi,
*  but it hasn't sustained in the way that I think some might have hoped.
*  Okay. So far lower viewership, I'm assuming that that's translating into lower salaries.
*  It does. Far lower salaries. Caitlin Clark who's widely used to be the first pick in the draft
*  for the WMBA will make about $75,000 in salary for rookie season. That's pretty low.
*  It's pretty low, particularly when you compare it to the NBA, the first pick last year
*  makes about $12 million this year. And it just accelerates on the veteran scale too. So you have
*  the very best players in the WMBA making more than $200,000 as the kind of ceiling.
*  But we're talking about just a totally different stratosphere than the men's game where you have
*  all sorts of contracts in the tens of millions per year. Caitlin Clark's been compared to Steph Curry
*  in the NBA, the incredible shooter from Golden State. He makes about $50 million a year.
*  Got that's a huge differential. Huge differential. So what you've seen a lot of female players do
*  over the years is supplement that income by playing abroad in other leagues professionally.
*  This is why Brittany Griner was in Russia. It's why players have traveled internationally
*  for many years to try to make some of that money that wasn't available to them in WMBA salary
*  some other way. Okay, so Caitlin Clark had this decision to make, GoPro or stay another year
*  in her college team. What did she decide to do? She decided to go pro. And I think there are a couple
*  of reasons for that. I think there's a real strong basketball case going back to Iowa,
*  having that experience again, maybe she doesn't grow as a player in the same way that she might
*  to go pro compete against the best. There's also the sponsorship side. She actually can retain a lot
*  of the sponsors that she's had, Gatorade sticking with her, Nike's going to be around.
*  I think there's a sense that she might be the exception that changes things.
*  She hopes that she is part of the next generation of players who can draw more eyeballs to that league,
*  who can maybe over the long run race salaries, bring sponsorship dollars to the pros.
*  She also can't stay in college forever. She can't be in Iowa until she's 40.
*  So essentially Caitlin's bet here is that she can take all of her firepower that she has right now
*  and potentially transform women's basketball. But how likely is that really mad?
*  You know, it's hard to know at this point. There are some data points so far that are pretty
*  encouraging if you're Caitlin Clark and the WNDA. Tickets are already being sold. Ticket prices
*  are up because of the demand for games for the Indiana fever who have the first pick in the
*  professional draft coming up. I expect to take Caitlin Clark. So this hasn't even happened yet.
*  She has not been officially selected first and we're already seeing ticket prices and ticket sales
*  spiking and anticipation for Caitlin Clark showing up. But I think there is a sense that
*  she is entering the league on a different level of stature with a different profile. But it's
*  untested. So Matt, what does the phenomenon of Caitlin Clark tell us about women sports?
*  It does this has come a pretty long way. You know, in some ways she's kind of the culmination
*  of this long arc that dates to Title IX, which was legislation that dictated that there could not
*  be discrimination on the basis of sex and was applied widely to sports, creating opportunities for
*  women. And at the time, obviously, this had to be legislated. This had to be mandated.
*  What is happening now with Caitlin Clark? This is the free market deciding that they're pretty
*  interested in women's sports. You know, sports is a business and there is a strong business case
*  as many sponsors are deciding for themselves to watch Caitlin Clark to follow Caitlin Clark
*  for leaks to want Caitlin Clark in their midst. And then there's the sort of broader cultural point.
*  Her coaches have talked about just the role model she is for tenacity and you know, she was
*  given a technical foul last year after saying, dammit, to her soul after she missed a shot. It's
*  the sort of thing that would like never be penalized in the men's game. They printed t-shirts that
*  said, dammit, and she posed with somebody like she has owned the kind of competitive streak
*  that men have been owning for so long. And I think modeling that beyond the sort of business case
*  is a real legacy that she's left. Yeah, like don't judge me differently, right?
*  Don't judge me differently. And you know, her coach still thinks that there is not as much latitude
*  given to women athletes. And I think that's certainly true. But it's moved them. I think there
*  is certainly more space given to that kind of competitive fire and a female athlete than there
*  might have been even a few years ago. Matt, thank you very much. Thank you very much.
*  Iowa is scheduled to play on Saturday. It will be the first game of the last tournament of
*  Caitlin Clark's college career. We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. Texas scored a fleeting win in its fight with the
*  Biden administration over a controversial immigration law. That law would allow Texas police
*  to arrest migrants crossing into the US illegally. The administration argues that immigration policy
*  and foreign affairs are the purview of the federal government. But Texas argues the law is
*  authorized by a clause of the Constitution that allows states in rare circumstances to take action
*  if they are, quote, invaded an argument that a lower court rejected in February.
*  On Tuesday, a US Supreme Court procedural ruling briefly allowed the law to take effect,
*  causing some confusion at the border until an appeals court put the law back on hold.
*  Texas will press its case for the law in oral arguments before the fifth circuit court of appeals
*  in early April. A decision to let the law take effect would upset decades of legal precedent.
*  Texas governor Greg Abbott said that he expects the constitutionality of the law will eventually
*  be decided by the Supreme Court. Today's episode was produced by Claire Tennis-Skitter,
