*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavrini-C. And this is the Daily.
*  As Israel's war on Hamas enters its sixth week, hospitals in Gaza have found themselves on the front lines.
*  There are a refuge for growing numbers of civilians fleeing the violence.
*  But one that has become increasingly dangerous, as Israel's military targets what it says are Hamas fighters hiding inside of them and beneath them.
*  Israel's bombing campaign has become one of the most intense in the 21st century.
*  Gaza and health officials say the death toll now stands at more than 11,000 people, higher than all previous wars between Israel and Hamas combined.
*  At the center of it all are doctors.
*  Hi, Dr. Ahmed. This is Sabrina Tavrini-C from the New York Times.
*  Hello, Dr. Marwan Ablusada.
*  The Daily has spent the past several weeks calling doctors all over the Gaza Strip, asking them what the war looks like from inside their hospitals.
*  And we get a partial casualty is coming at least 40 or 50 at one time.
*  How they are living, where are you sleeping? Are you going home?
*  And what they are doing to keep up with the flood of patients?
*  Just for one minute with the camera to see how many patients are waiting in the waiting room. Just one minute please.
*  Okay. Oh my goodness. I see so many patients.
*  Now, as Israel's military moves deeper into Gaza City, the war is pushing hospitals to the brink of collapse.
*  It's catastrophic situation, Madame. You have to watch by yourselves to see what I talk about.
*  Today, three doctors on survival in Gaza.
*  He's actually operating at the moment. Would you be able to call back in half an hour?
*  Of course, of course. So you need to go to a surgery right now.
*  Yeah, yeah, yes, I must go. Excuse me.
*  Okay, thank you.
*  It's Monday, November 13th.
*  Hello.
*  Hello, Dr. Abu Sita.
*  You're speaking a few weeks ago, my colleague Jessica Chung called Dr. Ghasan Abu Sita, a British Palestinian plastic surgeon.
*  Hi, how are you?
*  I'm good. How are you doing?
*  Now, exhausted, but otherwise intact.
*  Can you tell me a little bit about where you are right now?
*  I'm in the operating room of Shifa Hospital.
*  It sounds like a child is in pain.
*  She needs an amputation part of her foot.
*  She's six. Take it from underneath the rubber.
*  How many patients are at the hospital right now?
*  Around 1,600 to 1,700.
*  But the hospital capacity is 6,000.
*  So you can only imagine.
*  The day she reached him, he was working at Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, the largest hospital in the Gaza Strip.
*  Israel's army had not invaded Gaza yet, but its air strikes had driven many from their homes and Shifa had become a kind of refuge.
*  Around 60,000 people were living there.
*  If you walk through the hospital, it's turned into a tented city.
*  On the floors at the entrance, there are families sitting.
*  There are patients on the corridors, patients on mattresses, and the floors of the patients on trolley,
*  there are patients in the emergency room.
*  It's just surreal. It's surreal how open it is.
*  Across the hallway from my operating room door, there is a home three generational families, grandmother and parents and siblings.
*  And they have a little girl who's oxygen dependent.
*  She's like four and needs continuous oxygen.
*  So they're sitting next to an electric socket on the floor.
*  There are some patients on mattresses with their injuries.
*  It's a miserable grim.
*  It's a public health catastrophe waiting to happen.
*  This is a corner of our typhus waiting to happen.
*  And are you sleeping in the hospital?
*  In the operating room.
*  There's an each operating room that has a small area called recovery where we put patients right after the surgery,
*  just to monitor them until the anesthetic wears that recovery area is where I sleep.
*  Are colleagues there also sleeping there?
*  Everybody sleeping here and some people have brought their families.
*  And where are they sleeping?
*  Every available office covered storage room, corridor, whatever you can imagine.
*  And how many patients have you been able to see today? What have you done today?
*  I've just been operating all those days.
*  We brought in major burns patients.
*  So patients with over 40% burns.
*  We had a mother.
*  11 year old son who has a sickness.
*  We had a mother with burns to her legs and to his arms.
*  We had a seven month old with burns to his legs and arms.
*  But we also had this child with facial burns yesterday.
*  Who doesn't look like going to do well?
*  What happened to him?
*  We got over 60% burns.
*  Burns has faced his hands.
*  He's 13, 12, 13.
*  He was just whimpering.
*  Do you try to calm them?
*  Do you try to talk them through?
*  Absolutely.
*  What do you usually say to them?
*  Everything is going to be alright.
*  Even though you know it's not going to be alright.
*  You tell them that once the surgery is done, their parents will give them the best meals that they like.
*  Or get them some ice cream or whatever.
*  But you skids have been pulled from once and eats their lubble.
*  I've seen family being killed.
*  It's very little that effectively you can say to them.
*  And they're absolutely petrified.
*  This six year old girl needs an amputation to her foot.
*  We'll be taking her next to the operating room.
*  It's just been like that.
*  This is carnage on an unfathomable scale.
*  I need to go because the dad of the girl is here and we need to tell him that we need to do the amputation.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  The day after we talked to Dr. Abucetta on Friday, October 27th,
*  the drug communications to Gaza were cut.
*  No phone, no internet.
*  It was about two days before we could reach anyone again.
*  When we did, it had become clear that Israel had launched a ground invasion into Gaza.
*  And the doctors we spoke to told us it felt like the war was getting even closer.
*  Last night was horrendous, the bombing was just and very close.
*  And it was.
*  Are you worried about the Israeli military coming inside Gaza?
*  There are forces coming closer to Gaza City now.
*  This is actually awful.
*  We don't want this to happen.
*  Ten days ago, an Israeli air strike hit an ambulance near the entrance of Shifa Hospital.
*  Then, on Friday, the courtyard inside the hospital complex was hit.
*  Israel maintains that the hospital conceals a major Hamas military compound, including passageways hidden underneath.
*  It says the ambulance hit it was being used to transport Hamas fighters.
*  It also said that Hamas is hoarding fuel.
*  Hamas has denied all of this.
*  When we asked doctors about it, some said it wasn't true.
*  I mean, for me, it's just a narrative to justify targeting the hospital.
*  I mean, think about it is that under international law, it's still a crime to attack a hospital.
*  Regardless of who you say is underneath the ground.
*  Others said they didn't know.
*  All they knew was their reality in this war.
*  That their corridors were filling up even more with wounded and dying people.
*  The six children now they don't have drinking water to drink.
*  I received like water with real cala.
*  Just as their supplies were running out.
*  Some patients may die because of infection in the wound.
*  Why is there an infection in the wound? Because there is lack of active eye.
*  They were running out of disinfectant and were resorting to what they had on hand.
*  One of the scenes I have witnessed is seeing chloride using in the wiping the floors or wiping the windows.
*  We use it for the cleaning of wound infection.
*  Other examples I have seen nurses and doctors use vinegar to treat wound infections.
*  And I am sure it is not enough. It will not treat anything.
*  They said they were running out of medicine to operate on people.
*  MSF released a photo. It was an amputation of the foot of a little boy on the ground with no general anesthesia.
*  So he was just given sedative to fall asleep.
*  Part of what we do is doctors is really suffering.
*  And if you can't treat patients with pain control, it is intolerable.
*  They started rationing everything, particularly fuel to run the generators.
*  So many turned off the lights in their hospitals.
*  The wards are dark. The corridors are dark.
*  The communal areas, the lobby, the stairwells, they are dark.
*  And so it is a nightmare because you don't know who you are stepping on while you are walking.
*  Some said they were even operating on people using their phone flashlights.
*  Do you use light from your phone? How do you see?
*  Yeah, that is basically it. That is the trick.
*  You use light from your phone.
*  And they worried about how much time they had left.
*  Hospital without fuel, this hospital without fuel and electricity will turn from hospital into mass grave.
*  I am trying to find fuel for ambulances and electricity.
*  And some of those we talk to were spending much of their days trying to find fuel themselves, including Dr. Suhab Alhamz,
*  the general director of the Kuwaiti Specialist Hospital in Rafa in the south of Gaza.
*  I spent my day since 6 a.m. trying to call everyone.
*  I called the Honour, I called the International, I called the Minister of Health, I called,
*  I am trying to find her other hospital, it can help me.
*  I will stop my service here. The patients will die.
*  How many calls did you make about fuel today for this hospital?
*  Lots of calls, just a square. I spent my day just looking for water, for food, for food for my medical staff here.
*  We don't have even a bread for the last two days for the medical staff.
*  You don't have bread for the staff?
*  That's what happened here.
*  But we have no options. We cannot leave our patients, we cannot leave our hospital here.
*  And what about Hamas, Dr.?
*  You mentioned you're calling the Ministry of Health. Does Hamas help you with fuel?
*  Madam, you cannot ask me about Hamas. I am a doctor. I am associated professor here.
*  I am the head of surgery department in the faculty of medicine.
*  You cannot ask me about Hamas, about Jihad, about you should ask me the medical here.
*  You can ask Sraib what they are doing here.
*  They are killed by lots of honest people. I won't answer anyone. You ask me about the political situation here.
*  You talk about a humanity. You talk about catastrophe situation here in Gaza, madam.
*  One thing that we have heard, Dr.
*  One thing that we have heard, Dr.
*  is that there are reports that Hamas had been sitting on a stockpile of fuel in the underground tunnels.
*  Is that something that you've heard about?
*  I heard about the trial of the occupation.
*  I didn't hear about that except from the trial of the occupation.
*  You hear that lots of doctors, professors, consultants and medical students were killed here.
*  Do you hear about the ambulances that were destroyed by the trial of the occupation?
*  Do you hear about the hospital that were destroyed by the patient?
*  Do you hear about a lot of children and women and pregnant women and honest citizens
*  that were killed by the trial of the occupation?
*  And all the world, the whole world, that we call them the democracy, the democratic world,
*  just watch us. Nothing, do nothing. Just support Israel.
*  This is the United States. I want that how they can do this.
*  This is our life. This is our life. We have dreams. We have children. We have our own dreams.
*  This is all the truth. They destroyed everything.
*  I can hear your angry.
*  I'm angry. I am exhausted. This is bad dream.
*  I hope I walk out from it.
*  Just today we received about 12 children and women, pregnant women, two of them are pregnant.
*  There is a hospital date they were killed.
*  And we tried after they killed. We were trying to do the Zirian section after they are killed.
*  And the ER trying to save their babies. But we cannot do that.
*  Unfortunately, the feeders were killed also. We tried to save it. We tried.
*  What was it like for you when you discovered you couldn't save the babies inside the mothers?
*  Just I cried. The only thing I can do just to cry.
*  I cried when I fall asleep. I cried when I was walking. I cried.
*  Nothing to be done for them. Nothing to be done. Nothing to be smoking.
*  One of the children was nine year daughters. She was her mother.
*  She was all of her family. She was shocked.
*  No exhibition. Just just you silent.
*  One of the nurses just stayed with her till the morning.
*  And after that it went with one of her families, one of her cousins.
*  I hope that her cousin will take care of her.
*  Thank you.
*  As the days went on, the war was forcing doctors to make impossible choices.
*  Who would get treatment and who wouldn't? Who got anesthesia and who didn't?
*  Which wounds got disinfectant and which did not?
*  A number of doctors talked about making the most impossible choice of all.
*  Whom to save and whom to let die.
*  One doctor told us that it felt as if he was deciding on the souls of people.
*  Doctors also said that they found themselves in a strange new role.
*  The hospital is full of children, so we have children.
*  The children like running beside me, following me.
*  Please, we want to draw a take photo for us.
*  Two days ago we got a patient who was no one of her family alive.
*  Loan survivors of bombings.
*  She came alone 11 years old. She was misoriented.
*  No one knows the name. And she wasn't recovered with no bits.
*  The general manager of the hospital called me and said,
*  I know this is not your case, but please, can you take care of this little girl?
*  She has no one here.
*  One doctor said that for children who were too young to speak,
*  the staff would write unknown in marker on their bodies.
*  Every day we had a lot of cases like this.
*  A lot of children, their mothers, their fathers, without families.
*  Some said their hospitals were starting to feel like orphanages,
*  with children wandering the halls looking for parents who were no longer alive.
*  Even there is a numerical term that we are having.
*  It must be added to medical books, WC and SF.
*  One with child, no surviving family.
*  WC and SF.
*  Yes, and it happened every hour.
*  I have seen my cousins or even hundreds of WC and SF.
*  Ibrahim Matar is a resident ICU doctor at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the middle of the Gaza Strip.
*  And what happens to these children? Where do they go?
*  Who cares for them after they get better?
*  Who cares for them?
*  Actually, there is no answer for this question.
*  We don't even know their name sometimes.
*  So who would care for them so far?
*  No one.
*  I have seen two kids who are severely injured.
*  Those two kids do not know that their father and mother and all their siblings have died.
*  They were unconscious at the time of the bombing.
*  And now they are unconscious.
*  They are receiving treatment.
*  But simply they do not know.
*  And all the people are around them.
*  They do not tell them in order they are kids.
*  And they cannot handle the pain of the injury or the psychological pain of the grief.
*  How old are the kids?
*  The first is the 13-year-old senior who is having a severe community structure.
*  The other here brother is a 14-year-old who is having a severe head trauma and a brain hemorrhage.
*  But now they are both conscious and receiving treatment.
*  And they do not know that their family.
*  Father and mother siblings have all our destroyed.
*  Just let them know that you are going to see them soon.
*  Just in order not to make them feel sad.
*  It is painful hiding the truth.
*  It is some sort of a deceiving.
*  But sometimes you may do things that are not appropriate at that moment.
*  And maybe appropriate later.
*  Yeah. That must be so hard, Dr. Matar.
*  Yes, it is a pain in two infants here.
*  This is a very ambulances coming.
*  Oh, what is that in the background?
*  Now it is a new casualty.
*  And many paramedics are doing CPR.
*  And if it's for a child, yes, if it's for a child.
*  What are you looking at?
*  Many paramedics are rushing the child into the emergency department.
*  And they are doing CPR.
*  It is a one-inch child.
*  And it seems there is not a rising family.
*  W-C-N-S-F.
*  Yes.
*  How old is the child?
*  It looked like ten years old.
*  What is happening now?
*  I think it's a very important thing.
*  We are talking about the hospital.
*  Doctors and paramedics in the hospital are speaking about a new bomb.
*  And there is dozens of new casualty are in the...
*  In some time and they will reach the hospital.
*  And new cases.
*  We are now waiting in new cases.
*  I did not go home since the start of the conflict.
*  So I feel tired emotionally, physically, mentally, and in all aspects.
*  I did not see my family since the seventh October.
*  Where is your family?
*  They are in the north of Gaza.
*  They did not leave the north.
*  Are they okay?
*  Thankfully, yes. They are okay.
*  So far, I don't know what is happening later.
*  And I feel very anxious about them.
*  And every time in the hospital, I think of them.
*  And I hope they are fine.
*  Dr. Matar, is the child okay?
*  What is happening with that child?
*  I may enter the department and ask about them.
*  Just give me a few seconds.
*  Okay.
*  Stay on the line.
*  Hello.
*  Hi.
*  Yes, I've seen the kid.
*  The one who is being brought by the ambulance.
*  Is he okay?
*  No, he's not okay.
*  He's having a severe trauma.
*  He's having a severe trauma.
*  He's having a severe trauma.
*  We could see the brain matter.
*  So they want to see his brain through the wound.
*  He's still alive.
*  But he's having what Dr. Say brain death.
*  He's unconscious.
*  He's having large crack in his head.
*  So we are now as doctors in the ER department, I think,
*  and I think that the patient is not okay.
*  So the ICU doctors in charge may not integrate him because they may think that he's a hopeless case.
*  Because if they did, there will no any good result.
*  So this is now a situation of choosing between which cases will benefit from treatment or not.
*  And we are deciding whether to try to save him.
*  Yes.
*  And that must be such a difficult choice.
*  It is.
*  What is your biggest fear at this moment?
*  In this conflict, the first thing is that I don't want to die in a cold blood.
*  I am an innocent person.
*  The second thing is I'm afraid on my family.
*  I don't want my family to get injured or to die because they are also innocent.
*  We are afraid on our family more than we are afraid on ourselves.
*  And we don't just want to die in cold blood.
*  What do you mean we don't want to die in cold blood?
*  I mean that we are not target.
*  We are not target.
*  We are not target.
*  It is normal.
*  Is it human?
*  We need a ceasefire.
*  We need to be conflict to end and to have a normal life.
*  A normal life that includes taking safe at home, drinking, eating, cleaning water, seeing my friend, doing techniques.
*  in Akal room,
*  played without the sound of funding,
*  going to work,
*  pretending back from work,
*  playing football or soccer with my friends,
*  going to the beach.
*  Every day I used to go there and smell a breeze
*  of the beach and listen to the sound of waves,
*  listen to music.
*  I miss listening to music.
*  I'm a music lover and I love poetry.
*  I miss what I think about love,
*  about dream.
*  I was going to the gym before the conflict started.
*  I miss going to the gym.
*  Actually the gym I go to has been destroyed today.
*  I don't know why.
*  So I miss going to the gym.
*  How old are you, Dr. Matar?
*  I am 27, I'm still young, Dr.
*  You are.
*  Just I ignore my life back.
*  Now I can see the child who I told you about
*  is being taken to the place of the people.
*  You see the child being taken,
*  where?
*  In the place of the people.
*  They took the child,
*  you told me about to the morgue.
*  Yes, my friend who was working with him
*  is giving me a sign that he's dead.
*  It is sad.
*  It's very sad.
*  It's very sad.
*  Yes, yea that'send.
*  your friend doing now?
*  He returned to the ER department to see you as well.
*  There is no time to get sad over every case.
*  Thank you for giving me the chance to listen to me.
*  Thank you for sharing yourself.
*  You're welcome my friend.
*  It's my privilege.
*  Good night and wish a good night for me also.
*  Be safe tonight.
*  Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate that.
*  I hope.

*  Here's what all two should know today.
*  On Sunday, the Times reported that federal authorities are investigating whether New York City Mayor Eric Adams pressured the New York Fire Department to allow the opening of a Manhattan High Rise, housing the Turkish Consulate General, despite safety concerns with the building.
*  The Times cited three people with knowledge of the matter and said that the alleged pressure took place weeks before Adams' election two years ago.
*  The FBI is examining Adams' intervention as part of a broader public corruption investigation that led to the seizure last week of the Mayor's electronic devices.
