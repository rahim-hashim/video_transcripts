# The New Supreme Court Cases to Watch
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1D8C9V3TYY)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi. And this is The Daily.
*  Last week, the Supreme Court began its new term, picking up where it left off on the
*  most contentious issues of the day. But while previous terms produced major victories for
*  the conservative legal movement, my colleague Adam Liptak explains today why this term may
*  be different. It's Tuesday, October 10th.
*  Adam. Hi, Sabrina.
*  You're back, which means the Supreme Court is back. And we wanted to go to you, Adam,
*  trusted Supreme Court expert, to learn what big cases are coming up this term. And we've
*  had, of course, two terms of blockbuster cases that brought these huge changes to American
*  society, tugging it to the right. What do you expect to see this term?
*  I think this term will show us and bring into focus how far and how fast it wants to continue
*  to move to the right. It has a lot of unfinished business from those earlier terms. It's facing
*  a series of kind of follow-up cases in the areas of administrative law, agency power,
*  the Second Amendment, gun rights, and abortion, all of which are cases in which conservative
*  litigants and conservative courts are pushing hard in anticipation of a positive reception
*  from the Supreme Court. So you're saying that conservative legal activists
*  watch the 6-3 majority make major rulings on these three issues. And now they see an
*  open door and they want to push it to see how much farther they can go.
*  That's exactly right. So, Adam, let's dig into this. So let's start
*  with the administrative state, which, of course, I know is kind of a thing out there. But what
*  exactly is that? Start with the definition and then tell me about that case.
*  So for the longest time, the conservative legal movement has really despised the idea
*  that unelected bureaucrats, experts who work in agencies like the Environmental Protection
*  Agency or the Food and Drug Administration, that they would say are unaccountable to the
*  American public, get to make major decisions about American life that they say belongs
*  to Congress, or if not to Congress, to the courts, but not to what they would call these
*  deep state experts. And in various ways, they've tried to withdraw power from the agencies
*  and this term comes on the heels of two blockbuster decisions in the last term and the one before,
*  one of them making it hard for the EPA to address climate change, the other striking
*  down President Biden's student loan forgiveness program, both of them saying that the executive
*  branch had gone too far, had gone beyond what Congress had authorized. And those cases set
*  the stage for the new cases this term.
*  So what about this term? What about these new cases?
*  Well the biggest case asks the court to overrule really the foundational precedent in this
*  area, a 40-year-old precedent called Chevron. And it gave rise to a concept people call
*  Chevron deference. And this is going to sound technical, but it's important. What that case
*  says is if a law passed by Congress is ambiguous, then the agency gets to decide what the correct
*  interpretation of that statute is. And so long as it's a reasonable interpretation,
*  the courts defer to the agency. The short of it is that agencies which regulate all
*  kinds of aspects of American life, the environment, the workplace, the marketplace, at the margin,
*  but it's a wide margin, get to make the key decisions about how to implement a congressional
*  statute.
*  Essentially, that if the law as written is confusing or has different interpretations,
*  what this precedent says is that the federal agency, say the EPA for example, should be
*  able to decide how to interpret it. Like they don't need permission from Congress, it doesn't
*  fall to a judge, it's the federal agency itself that governs the thing.
*  That's right. So there's a logic to it. These are complicated statutes and complicated regulatory
*  areas. And you might want the experts to decide precisely how it applies. That's one kind
*  of argument. What the opponents of the Chevron doctrine say is that gives them too much power.
*  Congress, if it wants to do something, should say so. And if Congress doesn't say so, the
*  courts will step in and tell us what the law is.
*  And Adam, tell me about the case this term that the justices have taken up.
*  It involves herring fishermen in Cape May, New Jersey, who a federal law says have to
*  bring federal observers, federal monitors on their boats to make scientific assessments
*  and to make sure that there's not overfishing. The fishermen say they have no problem with
*  that. But the law doesn't say who pays for these monitors. And the federal maritime
*  agency says the fishermen should pay for the monitors. And the fishermen object to that,
*  both as a practical matter, they don't want to pay for it, but also as a kind of theoretical
*  matter, saying Congress hasn't said so explicitly and we shouldn't defer to the agency's interpretation
*  of who has to pay. That should get a fresh look from the courts.
*  And what is your sense of how the justices might rule on this?
*  The justices are hostile to Chevron, have not themselves invoked it in years, although
*  the lower courts continue to. And that gives you the feeling that this could be yet another
*  precedent like abortion, like affirmative action, a major precedent overturned by the
*  Supreme Court. I think Chevron's days might be numbered and that will be a very significant
*  move if the court indeed does overrule it.
*  It would essentially take power away from the government to regulate business.
*  It would take power away from the executive branch, away from agencies, and it would nominally
*  and here's the key point, it would nominally empower Congress. It would say, Congress,
*  you decide what the law is. But because we have a wholly dysfunctional Congress, what
*  it in effect does is transfer power to the judiciary and to the Supreme Court in particular.
*  And what does the Biden administration think about this?
*  The Biden administration in a brief in the case said that overruling Chevron would be
*  a convulsive shock to the legal system. It says that this is a workable arrangement,
*  a sensible arrangement, that people and agencies and business groups have organized their lives
*  around for decades and that there's no good reason to throw away this precedent. But Sabrina,
*  I don't expect every attack on the regulatory state to succeed.
*  We'll hear an argument this morning in case 22-448, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
*  versus the Community Financial Services Association.
*  Last week the court heard arguments in a challenge to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,
*  which is a consumer watchdog that protects consumers in banking, credit card, and all
*  kinds of other transactions.
*  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court. This case is about checks and balances. One
*  of Congress's most important checks on executive power is its power of the purse.
*  And the question in the case is whether the way the CFPB is funded through a request to
*  the Federal Reserve System for the amount of money it thinks it needs up to a fairly
*  high cap is constitutional. The challenge to the CFPB is that that funding mechanism
*  gives it too much independence, too much power. And the outcome of the ruling could be to
*  say that that mechanism is unconstitutional and therefore the agency is unconstitutional.
*  But that attack on the CFPB got very little traction even from the most conservative justices
*  on the court.
*  I get your point that this is different, that it's unique, that it's odd, that they've never
*  gone this far. But that's not, having gone this far is not a constitutional problem.
*  Justice Clarence Thomas said, yeah, it's true, it's odd, it's curious, it's novel, it's an
*  interesting way to fund an agency, but that doesn't make it unconstitutional. And if you
*  don't have Justice Clarence Thomas and you're a conservative lawyer, you usually don't have
*  a case.
*  So this attack on an agency that business groups, many of them kind of hate because
*  they're a very aggressive regulator, seems destined to fail. And it's worth thinking
*  about why that is. I don't think it's because the court fundamentally disagrees with the
*  general critique of the administrative state. But the cases that are reaching it are too
*  ambitious, too aggressive, too bold.
*  Okay, so when it comes to limiting the power of regulatory agencies, there are a few cases
*  before the Supreme Court and you're predicting a kind of mixed bag. Some wins, some losses.
*  Let's turn to the next issue in front of the court, guns.
*  So last year, two terms ago, the court issued a major decision, and major in two senses.
*  It struck down New York gun control law and it said for the first time that you have a
*  Second Amendment right to carry guns in public for self-defense. So that's huge. But also
*  huge was the standard the court announced, that Justice Clarence Thomas announced, about
*  how you decide whether other gun control measures are constitutional or not.
*  And remind me what that standard was, Adam?
*  So the standard, quite novel, draws on originalism, which is the idea that you want to figure
*  out what the Constitution meant when it was adopted. And what Justice Thomas said is that
*  you have to go back in history and figure out whether there was analogous regulation,
*  which is to say you have to find some regulation back in the day that was more or less similar
*  It doesn't have to be, he says, a historical twin, but it has to map on to the modern law
*  pretty well. And unless you can find an analogous regulation, it's unconstitutional. So that's
*  hardcore originalism and it has really caused lower courts a lot of distress because they're
*  not historians. And we now have a case that's going to test whether the court is really
*  serious about this methodology. It involves a guy named Zaki Rahimi, and he was the subject
*  of a domestic violence restraining order, and rightly so because he was, how to put
*  this, he did a lot of bad things with guns, including by threatening women, including
*  by shooting them in public in road rage incidents, or once when a friend of his didn't get the
*  fast food order that he wanted.
*  My God. But how is this case testing originalism and historical analogies?
*  So he's convicted under this federal law that says if you're subject to such an order, you
*  can't have a gun, he's found with a gun, he's convicted. And the Fifth Circuit says, well,
*  wait a second. In the founding era, there were no such things as domestic violence restraining
*  orders, and therefore the law is unconstitutional.
*  Wow. So that's the Fifth Circuit saying, hey, the new standard is history, here you go,
*  history.
*  Right. And I mean, this is telling, right, because it's kind of unsurprising that this
*  form of judicial order didn't exist at a time when in most places women had very few rights.
*  So you can tell there's a kind of disconnect between the standard announced by Justice
*  Thomas and trying to implement it. And I have to think that the gun rights folks are quite
*  unhappy that this is the follow-on case.
*  Why, Adam?
*  Because it's factually unattractive, it's sort of theoretically unattractive. So this
*  is probably a case where there's some overreach from the Fifth Circuit, where the Supreme
*  Court may well decide that this federal law that disarms people subject to domestic violence
*  restraining orders, even under the history standard, is constitutional. But it's going
*  to have to do some work to get there.
*  So those are a few of the big cases already on the court's docket. But the court is very
*  likely to hear another case and return to the area in which it has caused the most upheaval
*  in recent years, abortion.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Okay, so there's a case that you're expecting that will be taken up by the court, not on
*  the docket yet, but probably will be, and that is abortion. What is this case about?
*  Remind us, Adam.
*  So this case follows, of course, the 2022 Dobbs decision, which did away with the constitutional
*  right to abortion, but it allowed states that wanted to have abortion to continue to do
*  so, and anti-abortion groups saw another line of attack. More than half of all pregnancy
*  terminations these days involve an abortion pill called Mifepristone, and they make the
*  argument that 20 years ago the FDA was wrong to approve this pill, that it was unsafe,
*  and they obtained a sweeping injunction from a trial judge. It goes to the Fifth Circuit,
*  and the Fifth Circuit says, well, we're not going to go that far, but we are going to
*  cut back in significant ways, in ways that are particularly significant in light of Dobbs.
*  We're going to say that you can't get the pill by telemedicine, and you can't have it
*  mailed to you, which makes it much, much harder for women, and particularly women in
*  red states where abortion is banned or severely restricted from having access to this pill.
*  So it's a very significant case. It has already reached the Supreme Court once, and the Supreme
*  Court has paused the injunction. So today the pill remains as available as ever, but
*  it's less clear what will happen when, and I think the correct way to put this is when,
*  when the court agrees to hear the case and probably by June renders a judgment. And this
*  is important not only for abortion, but to return to the question of administrative law.
*  This would be the first time ever that a court would tell the FDA, an expert agency, that
*  they had gotten the science wrong and that judges, not medical experts, would make the
*  call on whether and how this abortion pill should be available.
*  Right, and this case was a big deal. We covered it on the show because the implications, of
*  course, would be huge. It would reach across all states, blue and red, and restrict this
*  pill that's been so widely used increasingly over the years and particularly since DOBS.
*  And it's another case, Sabrina, where you could make the argument that it has shaky
*  foundations. The plaintiffs in the case may well not have legal standing, meaning they
*  might not have suffered the sort of injury that gives them the right to sue. They are
*  doctors, but they're doctors who don't perform abortions, including medication abortions.
*  So it's a little hard to see what their connection is to the case.
*  And this FDA approval is decades old.
*  It was approved in 2000, if I remember correctly.
*  Right, and the statute of limitations for bringing these suits is six years. So you
*  do the math and, yeah, the lawsuit would seem to have been filed too late. So there are
*  problems with the case, and there's a larger, more conceptual problem for the Supreme Court,
*  because when they issued the DOBS decision, their rationale was, we're getting out of
*  the abortion business. We're going to let the people's representatives decide it. This
*  is not for judges. We're done with abortion. And it would be a hell of a move for them
*  then just a couple of years later to say, but you know what? We got a lot more to say
*  about abortion.
*  So once again, the conservatives are kind of rushing through an open door, but with
*  a case that's not exactly a slam dunk.
*  Yeah. So what this term is going to tell us is whether the Supreme Court, which has sent
*  signals that it is receptive to cases brought by conservatives, may not be receptive to
*  all cases brought by conservatives, because there are places at least in which the right
*  is moving too quickly, even for the tastes of this court.
*  So Adam, I want to talk about the broader context here, because when I think forward,
*  of course, these cases are going to be decided in the middle of an election. At the same
*  time, the justices themselves have been under a lot of scrutiny about whether they're too
*  cozy with political operatives. I'm thinking Justice Thomas failing to disclose gifts from
*  a wealthy Republican donor. I'm wondering if you think both of those pieces of context
*  will have an effect on the way this term plays out.
*  So it's hard to say definitively, because there are a lot of cross currents and a lot
*  of unknowns and the court's not particularly transparent. But I think you're right, Sabrina,
*  that these twin shadows of politics and ethics scandals will affect the court. The justices
*  over the summer were many of them out in public talking about their eagerness to have an ethics
*  code. And they say they're at work on that. And that means they're at least sensitive
*  to the public perception. Justice Thomas did the other day recuse himself from a case involving
*  his former law clerk and former Trump lawyer, John Eastman, involving Eastman's efforts
*  to subvert the election. And that's a step. So we have a court that's under all kinds
*  of pressure. And you might think that they don't want this to be the biggest term or
*  the third term in a row, where it's just blockbuster after blockbuster.
*  So Adam, we obviously don't know the answer yet, because, you know, these cases have yet
*  to be argued. But just to summarize here for a minute, there might be at least one big win
*  for conservatives if the court overturns the Chevron precedent, the thing you described to me.
*  But otherwise, this term may end up disappointing conservatives, like they got greedy and this
*  term told them no.
*  I think that's right. But it's early days. There are other cases on the horizon that we
*  don't even know about. There may be cases arising out of the election. There are efforts around
*  the country to knock Donald Trump off the ballot. Those could reach the Supreme Court. So it's
*  October. It's a long way till June. The term could take many different directions. But on the
*  evidence of these early cases, this may be a term in which a conservative court pushes back
*  against the right.
*  And I wonder, you know, if that will tell us something bigger about the movement, like this
*  decades long, very intentional effort to push the country to the right through the courts.
*  So the court continues to have a six justice, conservative supermajority, all appointed by
*  Republicans, and it will continue to move the law to the right.
*  The question, though, is how fast? So it's a question, Sabrina, not of direction, but of
*  velocity.
*  Adam, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. The conflict in the Middle East deepened on Monday,
*  with Israel's defense minister ordering what he called a complete siege of the long blockaded
*  Gaza Strip. Israel also hit the area with retaliatory airstrikes that destroyed buildings
*  including a mosque and a marketplace. Israel said the strikes were aimed at Hamas, the
*  militant group that controls Gaza and that launched the deadly attack on Israel over the
*  weekend. Later in the day, Hamas threatened to execute one Israeli civilian hostage every
*  time Israel hit Gazans in their homes without warnings with an airstrike. At least 150
*  Israelis were taken hostage by Palestinian assailants in the weekend's attack. Israel's
*  military said it had regained control over the Israeli border communities where the
*  incursion had happened, but acknowledged that the fighting was still ongoing. 800
*  Israelis and 687 Palestinians have been killed in the violence so far. And the Nobel Prize
*  in Economic Sciences was awarded to Professor Claudia Golden for her work studying women
*  in the labor market. Her research into subjects like the causes of the gender pay gap have
*  had a profound impact on the field of labor economics. She is the third woman to win the
*  prize and the first to be honored solo. Today's episode was produced by Rob Zipko, Luke
*  Vanderplug, Jessica Chung, and Olivia Natt. It was edited by Patricia Willens and Liz O'Balen,
