# Trump’s Immigration Crackdown Begins
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. This is The Daily. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=0.0s)]
*  Today, at the heart of President Trump's flurry of executive orders was a systematic [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=7.0s)]
*  dismantling of the country's current approach to immigration. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  I spoke with my colleague, Hamid Ali-Aziz, about what the orders do and the message that [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=24.84s)]
*  they send. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=31.96s)]
*  It's Wednesday, January 22nd. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=35.88s)]
*  Hamid, thank you for coming in the studio here in Washington, which is, the studio might [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=40.84s)]
*  be a little grandiose a word for what this is. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=48.72s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=50.84s)]
*  Kind of a closet. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=51.84s)]
*  It's tight. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=52.84s)]
*  But it gets the job done. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=53.84s)]
*  You have spent the past 24 hours or so studying President Trump's executive orders on immigration [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=55.24s)]
*  and what exactly they seek to accomplish. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=61.96000000000001s)]
*  With the benefit of that huge amount of time you've had to study this, how are you thinking [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  about them individually and collectively? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=69.68s)]
*  To me, it seems like President Trump is cramming basically four years of policy into one day. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  One half day. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=82.48s)]
*  When you look back at the first Trump administration, it took them a long time to introduce policies [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=84.44s)]
*  like remain in Mexico or trying to strip federal funds from sanctuary cities, ban asylum. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  All of that happened on Monday night within a matter of hours. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  How would you describe the ultimate goal of all these things he crammed into this first [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=102.12s)]
*  half day? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=105.92s)]
*  This was a way for President Trump to reimagine our immigration system, to crack down on the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=107.12s)]
*  system as a whole, the ability of people to come to this country legally, illegally, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=113.2s)]
*  and in many ways to make it more uncomfortable for people who are already in this country [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=119.8s)]
*  unlawfully. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=124.8s)]
*  To have them rethink whether or not this is worth it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=127.2s)]
*  The right place for them to be. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=131.4s)]
*  I think at the center of it, it's a condemnation really of the Biden administration's policies. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=133.04s)]
*  What Trump saw, what Stephen Miller, what many in that circle saw was President Biden [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=138.16s)]
*  opening the borders, making it too easy for people to enter this country and remain indefinitely [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=143.6s)]
*  and allow them to work and live and have no consequences for being in the country unlawfully. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=149.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=156.96s)]
*  And just as a factual statement, under President Biden, undocumented immigration in the United [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=157.96s)]
*  States reached record levels. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  So there's some basis for that complaint. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=166.12s)]
*  So let's talk about the orders that Trump issued on Monday relating to immigration. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=169.36s)]
*  So where should we start? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=176.18s)]
*  One of the first things that President Trump did is to get rid of a program that Biden [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=177.98000000000002s)]
*  administration put into place in 2023, trying to change the way people were entering the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=184.12s)]
*  country at the southern border. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=190.68s)]
*  At some point during the Biden administration, they realized that the current status quo [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=192.94s)]
*  was not working. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=197.85999999999999s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people were crossing the border seeking asylum and were being allowed [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=198.85999999999999s)]
*  to stay in the country indefinitely. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=204.1s)]
*  They saw this as a major problem and an incentive for more people to come and to cross. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=206.66s)]
*  So they thought one way to handle this is to set up a system through an app called CBP [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=213.86s)]
*  where people could schedule appointments to enter the country at a port of entry. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=220.42s)]
*  But if you crossed illegally, asylum access was no longer going to be given to you. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=224.86s)]
*  Got it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=230.42000000000002s)]
*  So this app is an effort to bring some order to the chaos of the border during the Biden [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=231.42000000000002s)]
*  presidency. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=237.94s)]
*  Totally. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=238.94s)]
*  The Biden administration felt like they were really providing a roadmap to stabilize the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=239.94s)]
*  border. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=244.18s)]
*  You could either come this way and you'd have a chance to stay in the United States or you [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=245.18s)]
*  come illegally and we're going to turn you back. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=249.62s)]
*  We're going to deport you. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=252.46s)]
*  We're going to send you back to your home country. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=253.62s)]
*  And does this app end up working? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=255.5s)]
*  Well according to the Biden administration, it does. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=258.58s)]
*  Ultimately, in the form of border numbers, the border numbers have been dropping throughout [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=260.54s)]
*  2024. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=265.94s)]
*  After the Biden administration put in tough restrictions at the southern border on asylum [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=267.94s)]
*  and paired it with this app, the numbers dropped precipitously. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=272.14s)]
*  As a point of comparison, you can look back to December 2023. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=276.98s)]
*  Nearly 250,000 people crossed the southern border. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=282.38s)]
*  In that month alone. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=286.18s)]
*  In that month alone. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=287.18s)]
*  And you see from there to the end of December 2024, one year later, we're at 45, 46,000 [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=288.62s)]
*  crossings at the southern border. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=296.74s)]
*  And on Monday, President Trump shut down this app. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=299.22s)]
*  Why would President Trump shut down an app that seemed to be accomplishing what President [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=302.86s)]
*  Biden hoped it would do, which is to bring some predictability to asylum seeking and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=306.42s)]
*  border crossing at the US-Mexico border? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=313.14s)]
*  President Trump and Republicans, including Stephen Miller, saw this as another form of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=316.38s)]
*  illegal immigration. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=320.58000000000004s)]
*  These were people in their eyes who had no other lawful way to enter the United States [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=321.90000000000003s)]
*  through a visa. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=327.34000000000003s)]
*  And if you look at the numbers, since early 2023 to the end of 2024, more than 900,000 [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=329.06s)]
*  people use this app to enter the United States. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=335.34s)]
*  Huh. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=338.22s)]
*  So while the numbers may have gone down overall once this app goes into place, there's still [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=339.22s)]
*  pretty big numbers by the end of a year. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=345.5s)]
*  Entering the United States, exactly. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=349.22s)]
*  Republicans felt like when you're examining the number of arrests at the southern border [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=351.46s)]
*  You need to add that total of people who are entering using this app, add that to the total [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=356.62s)]
*  of arrests as well, the southern border, to get a better picture of what's happening at [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=362.54s)]
*  the border. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=367.14s)]
*  So essentially, Trump, Stephen Miller, those around them would say that this app was a [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=368.14s)]
*  half measure, an unsuccessful solution to the problem of border crossings. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=373.1s)]
*  And it was facilitating illegal immigration. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=378.82s)]
*  So what happened once Trump ordered that the app be shut down? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=382.18s)]
*  We saw pretty immediately people on the ground in Mexico processing this news, talking to [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=385.7s)]
*  our colleagues saying they have this appointment, they've been waiting for it for a long time, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=391.5s)]
*  and they had no idea what was going to come next, what was going to happen to their cases, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=396.97999999999996s)]
*  their ability to enter the United States. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=401.94s)]
*  And according to a former Department of Homeland Security official who I spoke with, as of [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=404.14s)]
*  Monday morning, around 30,000 people had appointments to enter the country using this [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=409.54s)]
*  app, and those appointments are now canceled. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=414.94s)]
*  Is it right to think that what Trump accomplishes with this executive order that shuts down [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=418.54s)]
*  this app is he's effectively shutting down asylum? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=424.62s)]
*  Well there's another order that handles asylum in the southern border. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=430.74s)]
*  What Trump does in this separate order is to immediately say that there's an invasion [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=435.18s)]
*  at our border and no longer can we allow people to cross into this country illegally and claim [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=439.90000000000003s)]
*  asylum and remain indefinitely. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=447.46000000000004s)]
*  What Trump's saying here is we're going to take the deterrence approach. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=450.58s)]
*  We're going to tell you no longer can you enter our country illegally and have a chance [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=454.22s)]
*  to stay. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=458.5s)]
*  So basically Trump is taking away the route Biden had created to apply for asylum without [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=459.62s)]
*  crossing into the country, and with this order he's saying because of a surge of asylum seekers, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=467.02s)]
*  what he calls an invasion, we're not replacing that with anything. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=475.14s)]
*  Asylum in effect is over. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=480.22s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=482.94s)]
*  And how should we think about the underlying logic of that? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=484.58s)]
*  I think we've all come to understand that asylum as originally conceived is this concept [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=488.86s)]
*  that you are living in a place where life has become intolerably dangerous. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=495.94s)]
*  Perhaps you're on a government enemies list. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=502.1s)]
*  Perhaps gangs are threatening you or someone in your family and at any moment it feels [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=504.78000000000003s)]
*  like your life may end. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=511.26s)]
*  That's been a traditional way of understanding why someone would apply for asylum and over [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=513.3000000000001s)]
*  the past eight years it's felt like many coming to the United States seeking asylum [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=517.74s)]
*  are coming because their economic circumstances in their home countries are intolerable and [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=524.62s)]
*  the system has been overwhelmed by a kind of broader understanding of why someone's [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=531.54s)]
*  seeking asylum. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=536.86s)]
*  Is that essentially what the Trump people are saying is that the current system has [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=537.86s)]
*  encouraged too many people to invoke asylum and as a result the entire system has become [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=541.86s)]
*  indefensible. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=549.7s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=550.7s)]
*  In the order itself it details how our border system is not equipped to process people, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=552.32s)]
*  to analyze their backgrounds, any potential criminal history that they have, and our current [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=559.22s)]
*  system just does not work. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=564.6800000000001s)]
*  And to be fair, there is some bipartisan understanding of that. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=566.7s)]
*  Democrats have by and large come to that conclusion as well. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=570.9399999999999s)]
*  The Biden administration echoed a lot of these talking points of how the asylum system as [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=575.62s)]
*  it is currently at the southern border is just not operable. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=581.18s)]
*  But they offer these other pathways like the app. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=586.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=588.8199999999999s)]
*  They still defended it in principle. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=589.8199999999999s)]
*  Trump is saying don't even bother doing that. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=591.86s)]
*  The system just needs to end. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=594.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=596.38s)]
*  The system needs to end and also it's important to realize that and to note here that in federal [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=597.86s)]
*  law there is a provision that says that no matter the way somebody enters the United [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=603.1s)]
*  States they are able to claim asylum. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=608.7s)]
*  So this is something that advocates, the ACLU and others will point to when they inevitably [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=612.18s)]
*  sue the Trump administration. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=618.58s)]
*  They'll say this isn't a law. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=620.42s)]
*  People have the ability to claim asylum whatever way they enter the country. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=622.94s)]
*  What Trump is saying is that it's worth trying to shut down our southern border to stop this [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=627.26s)]
*  really high flow of people entering the country, what he terms as an invasion, millions of [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=634.3000000000001s)]
*  people coming into the country in recent years. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=639.4200000000001s)]
*  And he's looking with his other executive orders for a way to close the door on other [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=643.02s)]
*  pathways for immigrants who are seeking refuge in this country, closing those doors one by [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=648.86s)]
*  one. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=655.58s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=657.22s)]
*  Hamid, we've been talking about asylum and President Trump's plans to shut that down [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=667.22s)]
*  in multiple ways. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=687.14s)]
*  How else is he using these early executive orders to stop foreigners from trying to enter [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=688.6600000000001s)]
*  the United States? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=695.22s)]
*  Yeah, President Trump has directed the DHS secretary to immediately shut down a Biden [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=696.46s)]
*  era program that allowed immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela and Nicaragua to fly into [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=703.0600000000001s)]
*  the country through something called humanitarian parole. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=710.78s)]
*  And just explain what humanitarian parole is and how it fits into Biden's approach to [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=714.26s)]
*  immigration. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=718.74s)]
*  President Biden saw this as a way to allow people a different way to enter the country [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=719.82s)]
*  and to avoid taking this long journey through Mexico, entering the country illegally, putting [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=725.26s)]
*  their lives in the hands of smugglers. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=732.3399999999999s)]
*  So kind of like the app. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=734.5s)]
*  Exactly. And at that time, in 2023, the Biden administration was struggling mightily with [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=735.5s)]
*  crossings from migrants from these countries. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=743.2199999999999s)]
*  They wanted to give these migrants a different way to enter the country and to avoid crossing [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=747.0999999999999s)]
*  illegally. They thought this would be a solution to that problem. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=751.74s)]
*  Basically, the thinking was if they're going to come anyway, let's create a more legal [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=755.5s)]
*  ish path for them. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=762.78s)]
*  Exactly. And I think that there's almost a political element involved with this program, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=764.2199999999999s)]
*  which is to say to the American public, don't worry when this person enters the United States. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=769.42s)]
*  They have a financial sponsor that's going to take care of them. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=775.66s)]
*  They won't be living off the state. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=779.18s)]
*  This is a program that makes sense. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=781.5s)]
*  And they saw it as a solution that was working. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=783.66s)]
*  How many people used it? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=785.66s)]
*  More than 500,000 in two years use this program. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=787.02s)]
*  Which is a lot of people. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=791.58s)]
*  So in Biden's mind, this recognizes a problem at the border, finds a way to deal with it. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=792.62s)]
*  I'm going to guess that to Trump, 500,000 people coming from those countries is perhaps [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=797.66s)]
*  500,000 too many. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=803.98s)]
*  They saw this as a way for the government to allow people who had no other route to [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=805.34s)]
*  the United States to fly into the country and to remain as long as they wanted. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=810.62s)]
*  And so I think this speaks to a lack of communication from the Biden administration, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=815.42s)]
*  from President Biden explaining his approach. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=819.1s)]
*  He was never able to do that in a really succinct way. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=822.14s)]
*  And other people filled that vacuum. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=824.7s)]
*  Conservative figures were saying that the US government was sponsoring people to fly [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=827.34s)]
*  into the United States, to come into your cities. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=833.74s)]
*  And this just was not true. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=837.34s)]
*  Got it. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=838.7s)]
*  And so far we've talked about Biden-era programs that President Trump has shut down, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=839.42s)]
*  but he also moved to close off other programs that preceded President Biden and that were [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=843.66s)]
*  supported on a bipartisan basis. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=849.9s)]
*  What's an example of an executive order that did that? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=851.8199999999999s)]
*  President Trump decided to pause, suspend our refugee admissions program. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=854.9399999999999s)]
*  As of next Monday, January 27th, the program will be shut down. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=861.0999999999999s)]
*  And in the next 90 days, the Department of Homeland Security will have to deliver a report [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=866.54s)]
*  to President Trump in which they say whether or not it's necessary for President Trump to [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=872.22s)]
*  bring back the refugee program and whether that's in the national interest of the United States. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=877.34s)]
*  Can you just distinguish, for those of us who maybe pretend we know but really don't, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=882.86s)]
*  the distinction between someone seeking asylum and a refugee? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=887.1s)]
*  Refugees applying for entry into the United States from abroad. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=891.26s)]
*  They are oftentimes in a third country in a refugee camp. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=896.54s)]
*  They've gone to the United Nations and they've said, I'm a refugee. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=900.9399999999999s)]
*  That kick starts a process that can take upwards of two years where they're vetted by the United [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=904.78s)]
*  States. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=911.26s)]
*  They go through all kinds of health and security checks and they're waiting for a long time to [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=912.14s)]
*  enter the country. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=917.9s)]
*  But if they do, at that point, they get a pathway to US citizenship. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=919.42s)]
*  For all intents and purposes, it's a legal pathway. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=924.4599999999999s)]
*  It's legal immigration to the United States. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=927.26s)]
*  So this is quite different from someone coming into the US and seeking asylum. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=929.3399999999999s)]
*  How many refugees has the US let in over the past few years? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=933.66s)]
*  Under the Biden administration, it took them four years to rebuild the refugee system that [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=939.02s)]
*  President Trump dismantled his first time in office. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=944.4599999999999s)]
*  By the end of the Biden administration last year, they had allowed around 100,000 refugees. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=948.14s)]
*  This is the highest total in 30 years. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=954.46s)]
*  Wow. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=956.86s)]
*  And this isn't something that's historically Democrat or Republican. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=957.4200000000001s)]
*  If you look back to President Bush, before he handed over the White House to President Obama, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=961.98s)]
*  he allowed in over 60,000 refugees. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=968.46s)]
*  This is a bipartisan supported program. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=971.4200000000001s)]
*  But for Trump, it represents a potential security threat. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=975.26s)]
*  And the way he's talked about it is, these are immigrants from areas like the Middle East, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=978.38s)]
*  Syria, and other places, Sudan, who could potentially be a threat to the United States. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=985.18s)]
*  These are talking points that he comes back to repeatedly. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=991.5s)]
*  And in the order itself, President Trump cites the fact that our country is taking too many [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=995.9799999999999s)]
*  immigrants and we're not equipped to take more immigrants, including refugees. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1001.18s)]
*  This is not the time for cities like Denver, New York, and other places [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1006.62s)]
*  to take immigrants, even if they're refugees. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1011.5799999999999s)]
*  So far, we're talking about executive actions designed to keep people from coming to the US. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1014.38s)]
*  But of course, the order that has probably gotten the most attention so far [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1020.14s)]
*  does something different. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1024.94s)]
*  It affects those already inside the United States. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1026.46s)]
*  Yeah, the birthright citizenship executive action by President Trump was far more sweeping than [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1031.9s)]
*  I expected, than we expected. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1038.7s)]
*  Hmm. How so? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1040.54s)]
*  The way it works right now is, when you are born in the United States, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1041.8200000000002s)]
*  you automatically get US citizenship. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1046.54s)]
*  Birthright citizenship. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1048.6200000000001s)]
*  Exactly. This is the way we've long understood US citizenship in the United States. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1049.74s)]
*  We look to the 14th Amendment, which ensures this right. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1054.7s)]
*  But President Trump is completely changing that. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1058.14s)]
*  He's making it so if your mother was here in the country unlawfully or was here with a [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1061.3400000000001s)]
*  temporary visa and your father did not have US citizenship or a green card, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1068.22s)]
*  no longer can you be considered a US citizen. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1074.7800000000002s)]
*  Right. A pretty bold thing to do, given that it's in the Constitution. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1077.74s)]
*  Exactly. And President Trump and some Republicans saw this as an incentive for immigrants to enter [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1081.82s)]
*  the country unlawfully and be able to have their children get US citizenship. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1089.82s)]
*  And this is something that they believe no longer should be a thing in the United States. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1096.3s)]
*  So the motivation behind this is to take away birthright citizenship as a deterrence, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1101.5s)]
*  because it has been, in Trump's mind, a lure, a draw for people to come here, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1107.18s)]
*  have a child in the United States that becomes a citizen, taking it away would take away that [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1113.1000000000001s)]
*  incentive. If you look at all these orders together, it's a lot of deterrence, a lot of [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1118.22s)]
*  making people uncomfortable who are here in the United States unlawfully or temporarily. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1123.74s)]
*  And this is just another way to do that. Of all Trump's executive orders, this one [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1129.1000000000001s)]
*  would seem like it has the steepest legal hill to climb. And perhaps deterrence is so [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1133.42s)]
*  primarily the goal that he doesn't mind if it gets legally challenged. But we should [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1140.78s)]
*  assume that this is going to be legally challenged and that it might successfully [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1146.38s)]
*  be legally challenged, perhaps alongside many of these executive orders. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1150.22s)]
*  This is the one that so far has inspired the most lawsuits of all the executive orders so far. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1154.14s)]
*  Lawsuits already? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1160.78s)]
*  We've seen several lawsuits, states across the country on Tuesday, including New York, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1161.74s)]
*  cities like San Francisco have filed lawsuits over this executive action. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1168.78s)]
*  So they're already being inundated with legal challenges. The question is, what happens when [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1173.26s)]
*  this inevitably gets to the Supreme Court? It is kind of hard to get over the fact that it is in [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1179.18s)]
*  the U.S. Constitution and is something that most people have recognized as a fact, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1184.86s)]
*  as just the way things work in the United States. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1191.02s)]
*  I want to put all these orders together and think about the collective impact. Taking away this [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1194.3799999999999s)]
*  app that gave people appointments to seek asylum, ending essentially asylum itself, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1202.1399999999999s)]
*  ending the refugee program, ending the humanitarian parole program and birthright citizenship. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1208.46s)]
*  And that, of course, is on top of Trump's promise to undertake mass deportations in the coming days [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1215.42s)]
*  and weeks. As you're hinting at, it's hard to imagine a stronger message to anyone seeking to [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1221.42s)]
*  come to the United States than it's essentially pointless and futile and you shouldn't do it. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1229.18s)]
*  And we're going to make, in your words, the experience very uncomfortable. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1234.62s)]
*  And what's clear is that poll after poll shows that Americans believe the country has been [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1238.86s)]
*  allowing too many migrants into the country and Trump now has a mandate to do something about it. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1245.5s)]
*  He has been calling this a revolution of common sense. For many Americans, many of these orders [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1252.2199999999998s)]
*  might look like just that because Biden seemed to be taking smaller half measure versions of the same [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1259.9s)]
*  actions. President Trump clearly feels emboldened to take aggressive action [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1271.5800000000002s)]
*  and crack down on our immigration system. Oftentimes when you speak to voters across the country, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1276.94s)]
*  this comes up almost every time. Every single time people see this [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1282.3000000000002s)]
*  immigration system as in chaos and they want some tightening, some control. And what Trump is saying [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1286.46s)]
*  is this is the time to do that. This is the time to shut it down in many ways. But the question is, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1293.1000000000001s)]
*  will that work? Right. This is going to be a real test of whether or not deterrence works. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1299.9s)]
*  What the Biden folks saw was if we incentivize people to take legal pathways, come through the [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1306.14s)]
*  app, come through humanitarian parole or through the refugee system, then we'll incentivize people [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1312.3s)]
*  not to cross illegally. And the numbers did after reaching record levels come down. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1319.02s)]
*  Exactly. You're saying the question is if you start to foreclose the legal pathways, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1324.54s)]
*  are you actually incentivizing, perhaps unintentionally, a return to higher levels of [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1329.82s)]
*  illegal and more dangerous crossings? It'll be a question of whether or not this [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1337.1799999999998s)]
*  communication of mass deportations, of no more birthright citizenship, of closing down asylum [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1342.62s)]
*  and shutting down our borders, whether or not that will inspire people to go back to their home [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1350.2199999999998s)]
*  countries, stay in Mexico, or whether they'll be incentivized to cross the country and try to come [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1356.3799999999999s)]
*  into the United States undetected and avoid any law enforcement noticing them. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1362.94s)]
*  Right. And it will be some time before we have an answer to that. But beyond the question of whether [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1367.66s)]
*  or not the numbers go up or down in the next couple of weeks, what Trump is doing here would seem to [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1372.14s)]
*  fundamentally change the United States relationship with those seeking to come here. And I'm [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1378.54s)]
*  remembering a conversation that I had with one of our colleagues, Julie Davis, during Trump's first [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1386.38s)]
*  term about this same set of questions. And the formulation she came up with is that when it comes [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1392.8600000000001s)]
*  to immigration, Biden and Democrats, many of them in this moment, see it as a question of what [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1401.1000000000001s)]
*  immigrants bring to the United States and the United States' role as a refuge. Trump and many [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1409.1000000000001s)]
*  Republicans in this moment see it very differently as a question of what immigrants take from the [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1417.74s)]
*  United States and the damage that they are causing to it and to its citizens. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1424.94s)]
*  Exactly. It's almost like the story that Americans and America has told itself is that we're a place [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1431.82s)]
*  of refuge. We're a place that takes in people who are fleeing these really dangerous conditions [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1438.78s)]
*  and Trump is seeking to remake that idea and say, it's time for Americans to think about themselves [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1448.22s)]
*  and if we don't have a border, like he said repeatedly, we don't have a country. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1454.54s)]
*  And what we now know is that tens of millions of Americans agree with that idea. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1462.78s)]
*  Mohammed, thank you very much. I appreciate it. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1467.82s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1477.26s)]
*  As of Tuesday night, Attorneys General from 22 states had sued President Trump in federal court [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1482.06s)]
*  in an effort to block his executive order ending birthright citizenship. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1488.9399999999998s)]
*  In the lawsuits, the officials called the order, quote, extraordinary and extreme. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1493.9s)]
*  Meanwhile, I ask you to have mercy, Mr. President, on those in our communities [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1501.66s)]
*  whose children fear that their parents will be taken away [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1506.7s)]
*  and that you help those who are fleeing war zones and persecution in their own lands to find [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1510.54s)]
*  compassion and welcome here. During a church service at the National Cathedral attended by [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1516.78s)]
*  Trump and his vice president, J.D. Vance, Bishop Marianne Edgar Buddy, the leader of the Episcopal [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1522.94s)]
*  Diocese of Washington, appealed directly to Trump to show mercy on immigrants. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1529.5800000000002s)]
*  Our God teaches us that we are to be merciful to the stranger, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1537.18s)]
*  for we will all want strangers in this land. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1544.46s)]
*  Trump repeatedly grimaced as she spoke and after returning to the White House from the Cathedral, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1548.6200000000001s)]
*  criticized the bishop, saying, quote, I didn't think it was a good service. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1555.5800000000002s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1563.98s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. On Tuesday, several of those sentenced to the [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1578.46s)]
*  longest prison terms for their role in the January 6th assault on the U.S. Capitol were released [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1584.22s)]
*  because of President Trump's blanket pardons and commutations. Among those set free were Stuart [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1590.6200000000001s)]
*  Rhodes of the Oath Keepers Militia, who was serving 18 years for seditious conspiracy, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1598.46s)]
*  and Joseph Biggs of the Proud Boys, who was serving 17 years for the same charge. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1605.34s)]
*  In Congress, lawmakers who had run for their lives to escape the rioters in 2020 were split [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1612.4599999999998s)]
*  in their reactions to Trump's pardons. Democratic leaders condemned them as a brazen act of lawless [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZImq6TGqgk&t=1619.8999999999999s)]
