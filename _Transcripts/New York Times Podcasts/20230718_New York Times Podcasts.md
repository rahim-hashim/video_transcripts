# The Writersâ€™ Revolt Against A.I. Companies
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rEIeWoeDVA)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, to refine their popular technology, new artificial intelligence platforms like
*  ChatGPT are gobbling up the work of authors, poets, comedians, and actors without their
*  consent.
*  As my colleague, Shira Frankel found, a rebellion is brewing.
*  It's Tuesday, July 18th.
*  Shira, it is really nice to have you back.
*  It has been far too long.
*  I agree.
*  It's great to be back here.
*  We are turning to you in our ongoing and very diligent efforts to understand this new era
*  in artificial intelligence and the debate that is raging over sites like ChatGPT, which
*  have put artificial intelligence really at everyone's fingertips.
*  And correct me if I'm wrong, but it really feels like this is shaping up as a clash between
*  those who are really excited about the capabilities of sites like ChatGPT.
*  You know, what can it do next?
*  This is so interesting.
*  And this huge group of people who are like just freaked out about it, right?
*  And it's going too far.
*  It's too scary.
*  And we've done a lot of episodes about this, right?
*  Recent one looked at students who love ChatGPT because it can do their homework for them.
*  And their teachers and professors were like, wait a minute, you're basically cheating.
*  And you have been reporting on the latest chapter of this clash between human and machine.
*  So tell us about that.
*  Well, what I've been focused on is really just all the battles over what goes into these
*  AI machines and what makes them powerful, what makes them able to sort of imitate human
*  voice is all of the content that we've put online over all these years.
*  It's the poems and the blogs and the photographs and the illustrations that are then copied
*  and scraped and fed into these AI machines.
*  It's what teaches them to imitate human behavior.
*  And in the past six months, as this software has become really powerful and very popular,
*  more and more people have started asking questions about whether they want their content fed
*  into AI machines.
*  And if they don't want it there, if there's really anything they can do about it.
*  So tell us who exactly these people are who are asking these questions.
*  They kind of fall into two groups.
*  They're the people who are doing so because it's their livelihood.
*  They have a copyright on their material and they have some kind of legal protection against
*  their work.
*  The other group are the hobbyists.
*  They're the people who are writing stories for the fun of it, that are just creating
*  art because they're passionate about something and they're putting stuff out into the ether
*  of the internet.
*  They love it.
*  They want to share it with the world.
*  This is just a true sort of moment of human creativity.
*  But you know, both of these groups are kind of seeing chatty beachy.
*  They're seeing these AI companies valued at hundreds of millions of dollars and they're
*  realizing that their creativity is making someone else a lot of money and they're feeling
*  exploited.
*  They're feeling like their creativity, their moment of inspiration is being used.
*  So let's start with this first group of creatives who sound like they are the kind of big fish
*  because they have copyright protection.
*  Right.
*  These are people like actors, animators, writers, people who make their livelihood by uploading
*  what they're doing to the internet.
*  And so they've been really alarmed when a chat GPT comes along and can produce art in
*  their style or can write a paragraph in their style.
*  So I go to the hotel, super fancy.
*  You know, take for instance Sarah Silliman.
*  And I go to check in.
*  Oh, and the lady at the front desk recognized me and she was like, oh my God, I love you.
*  You are in my top four all time favorite comedians.
*  She is a comedian, an actor, a writer who has honed an incredibly distinctive style
*  over decades of working.
*  And I was like, you know that I know that means I'm fourth, right?
*  Not walking away from this like, maybe I'm second.
*  And you know, if you go to chat GPT and say, tell me a joke in the style of Sarah Silliman,
*  which is something I tried out, it really gets her spot on.
*  And she argues that not only has it read her jokes and read her, you know, other sort of
*  online comedy, but that it's even read this book that she wrote, Bedwetter, which has
*  been uploaded online and exists in online versions.
*  She appears pretty convinced that it's essentially learned who she is and what her comedic style
*  is.
*  It can mimic her to the degree that you think it is her writing.
*  And I'm guessing chat GPT likely did that without asking her permission.
*  Right.
*  There is no permissions being asked here because there are essentially imagine these like giant
*  machines that are crawling the internet at all times.
*  And any data they come across, they collect, they scrape it.
*  They don't know what they're doing.
*  They're converting it into numbers.
*  It's basically the math in these systems.
*  And so anything online is constantly being hoovered up by these machines and fed into
*  AI systems.
*  And so for a creative professional like Sarah Silverman, that feels incredibly threatening
*  in terms of their livelihood, their ability to make a living off of being an artist with
*  an independent voice that's been honed over decades.
*  If a machine can do that, why would you need to pay Sarah Silverman to come and write your
*  script or pen a comedy special?
*  But how can you be so sure that chat GPT is really stealing from you if you're someone
*  like Sarah Silverman or if you're anybody really whose work has been uploaded by chat
*  GPT?
*  Because my guess is that this gets a little bit sticky, right?
*  Like how much of it is just guesswork and how much of it is really being derived from
*  essentially borrowed or stolen material?
*  Definitely.
*  I mean, well, to begin with, there are these repositories where you can go and check and
*  see if your work has been scraped.
*  A lot of artists do this.
*  A lot of writers do it.
*  And they'll see there that your name will appear, your piece of art will appear.
*  And so for someone like Sarah Silverman, she can go and see, OK, right, my book has been
*  scraped.
*  But more specifically, it's really just playing with this and testing it out for yourself
*  and toying with it.
*  You know, I was curious as I was reporting the story.
*  So I went online and I typed in my name and I said, can you write a paragraph about the
*  danger of online extremism in the voice of Shera Frankel?
*  Which is the subject you cover, of course, over and over and over again from the Times.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  And you know, I've written books, I've been writing about it for over a decade.
*  It's out there.
*  My material is out there.
*  And when I tell you that even after knowing about AI for a year, even after covering this
*  topic for a year, I was creeped out at how close they got my voice.
*  I could have easily written this sentence.
*  Explain that.
*  I mean, I'm not on chat GPT right now, so I can't replicate the search.
*  What happened when you said, you know, write a paragraph about the subject I know best,
*  Shera Frankel, and it spit out the results?
*  What about it felt so distinctively Shera Frankel-esque?
*  So I will read it to you.
*  So it writes this one opening sentence, which is online platforms once hailed as bastions
*  of free expression have become breeding grounds for hate, radicalization and the propagation
*  of dangerous ideologies.
*  That expression, the bastions of free expression, I've used that.
*  I Googled it.
*  I've used that in an article less than a year ago and again in an article three years ago.
*  I didn't even realize that that was a phrase or turn a phrase that I often used until chat
*  GPT repeated it back to me.
*  Right.
*  It's kind of a distinctive set of words you're saying that you turned to and it just borrowed
*  from you in replicating your work.
*  Well, it knew my brain better than I did.
*  I didn't realize that that was phrasing I frequently used.
*  And I had to go into the New York Times archives to figure out, oh, yeah, it's right.
*  I do use that.
*  Oh my God, I probably use it too often because this machine has learned it about me.
*  Right.
*  And suffice it to say, you were not like Sarah Silverman consulted about your work being
*  scraped by chat GPT.
*  Nope, we were never consulted and no one at the New York Times was consulted.
*  Got it.
*  So Sarah Silverman did not like that experience.
*  You described it as a little bit eerie.
*  I'm wondering if it's a touch flattering to have chat GPT borrow your stuff or if you
*  worry about the long term economic consequences of it all, which is to say that someday chat
*  GPT might be able to replicate your journalism so brilliantly that maybe the Times doesn't
*  need you on the beat anymore.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I've actually spent so much time thinking about this.
*  And there's a part of me that was thinking, oh God, it kind of be nice when I was done
*  with reporting to plug in my notes to a machine and have it.
*  There are days where it would be nice to have a machine write my article for me.
*  But no, no, I thought about it more and then I was like, yeah, it can imitate what I've
*  already done.
*  But the whole point of news is that what we're bringing you is fresh and based on new reporting.
*  So the conclusions we're drawing for readers are constantly changing.
*  And AI can't do that.
*  It can only repeat and regurgitate what's already been given to it, what's already in
*  the system.
*  And so whatever answer it gives you might be what Chirra Frankel thought about something
*  two years ago or five years ago.
*  But it won't be what the newest idea is or the freshest reporting has brought readers.
*  Right.
*  It might just keep telling the world that you think something's a bastion of free expression
*  when you think it's a bastion of not free expression.
*  Exactly.
*  If it's become a bastion of hate speech and extremism.
*  OK.
*  So what can creatives do about essentially this theft?
*  Right.
*  What can the Chirra Frankels and the Sarah Silvermans of the world do?
*  And what are they doing about this problem?
*  So the creatives with a copyright, the creatives with the legal protection of a copyright can
*  file lawsuits.
*  And that's exactly what we're seeing happen.
*  There's been nearly a dozen lawsuits that have been filed against AI companies by everybody
*  from book publishers to individuals who have copyright protections.
*  And one of them was Sarah Silverman, who got together with another two authors to sue several
*  AI companies, including Metta, which is the parent company of Facebook, and OpenAI, which
*  is the parent company of ChachiBT, to say that their work was illegally scraped and
*  downloaded and uploaded into these AI systems.
*  And Chirra, what do legal experts think are the chances that this kind of a lawsuit from
*  a Sarah Silverman will prevail against a company like ChachiBT?
*  Well, you know, this is all brand new.
*  It's brand new case law.
*  But they know they have to establish some kind of law or precedent going forward, because
*  this is material with a copyright.
*  For a lot of artists, books they wrote 10 years ago or 15 years ago, that's going to
*  continue to make them money throughout their lives.
*  And yes, they're evolving constantly as artists.
*  They want to think about their material going forward.
*  They don't want ChachiBT to write their jokes for them going forward.
*  But they also want to be paid for the books that have already been published and are already
*  out there.
*  Is the feeling that old school copyright law will provide someone like Sarah Silverman
*  with the legal protections that she's seeking?
*  Well, the legal experts seem incredibly hopeful that there is some kind of copyright protection
*  here, and that essentially some kind of financial damages will be awarded and that some kind
*  of monetary value will be placed on these very strong copyright protections that creative
*  professionals get.
*  The problem is that even if they get that money, even if Metta or OpenAI are forced
*  to pay some kind of damages to Sarah Silverman, the content, the data, it can never be retrieved.
*  It's out there.
*  It's become numbers and ones and zeros fed into a machine.
*  There is no way to go into that machine and get that data back out.
*  Once it's in, it's in forever.
*  And so ultimately, even if they do get that financial reward through the court system
*  and they get the copyright protection to the material affirmed by the courts, their data
*  is gone.
*  Their data is there forever.
*  In other words, the horse is out of the stable.
*  I assume that's true, Shira, for us, for the Times, for the work of people like you.
*  We can't retrieve your journalism back from a chat GPT.
*  So is the Times, like Sarah Silverman, thinking of suing these AI companies?
*  So the New York Times, to the best of our knowledge, is not looking at a lawsuit.
*  What we've seen the New York Times and other news publishers do is start to think about
*  how to start charging for this data going forward.
*  I mean, the New York Times is creating tons of content every single day that these machines
*  want to stay up to date.
*  And so they're really trying to figure out if there's some kind of financial arrangement
*  that can be put into place where these AI companies pay us.
*  And it's not just news publishers.
*  Websites like Reddit.
*  They're looking at licensing their data as well.
*  They're saying this data is inherently valuable and we want you to pay us for it.
*  But look, that's going to take a long time for them to come to an agreement.
*  This is a brand new model.
*  This is a brand new technology.
*  And in the meantime, the data is still being scraped.
*  In the meantime, these systems have all the articles that have already been published.
*  They probably are being updated on new articles as they come out.
*  All this material is still being fed into these machines as these talks are ongoing.
*  Right.
*  And will be for some time.
*  So you're saying the copyright protected creators who would seem to have the strongest position
*  in this equation are not really mounting that forceful a pushback despite the anger that
*  you're describing here.
*  Right.
*  I mean, they are using the courts.
*  They are using the legal system.
*  But as we know, that's slow.
*  Waiting for the courts to take action, waiting for lawyers to hammer out a financial agreement
*  between a massive news organization and an AI company is a slow process.
*  And what's interesting for me is that this other group of people that I mentioned, those
*  that don't have a copyright protection, the hobbyists, the enthusiasts, the people that
*  are posting to the internet for the fun of it, they're the ones that are leading the
*  most creative rebellion or revolt against AI.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Shira, tell us more about this second group of creators who are fighting back against
*  AI platforms, these hobbyists and amateurs, as you've described them, who lack the legal
*  copyright protections of people like you and Sarah Silverman.
*  So you know, actually, a group I spent a lot of time interviewing and thinking about was
*  fan fiction writers.
*  And you know, for anyone who's not familiar, because before I reported the story, I never
*  actually read any fanfic.
*  Fanfic.
*  Now you're in authority.
*  I am now deep in the fandoms.
*  These are people who watch a movie like Star Wars and love it, but walk away from it thinking,
*  what would happen if the main characters at the end, Kylo Ren and Rey, didn't die?
*  What if they fell in love and got married?
*  I'm sorry if I'm having movie spoilers in my answers here.
*  What would happen if in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, two of the vampires met in high school
*  and had a gay romance?
*  I mean, they take these popular movies and TV shows and they let their imaginations roam
*  and they publish these incredible, I mean, book length pieces of content about their
*  favorite movies and TV shows.
*  And you know, this is not stuff they have any kind of copyright to.
*  So if anything, they're borrowing from ideas and characters that are already out there,
*  but they're doing it for the love of those characters and the storylines that they want
*  to explore in their own writing.
*  And how did writers of fanfiction discover that their work was being sucked up by platforms
*  like chat GBT?
*  So you know, they actually discovered this in a really, really funny way, which is that
*  in fanfiction, you create your own characters.
*  And some of them have names like Bucky, which is a combination of several characters from
*  Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
*  And so they go to chat GPT and they type in, write me a story about Bucky falling in love
*  with a vampire.
*  Write me a story about Bucky on a summer day eating a popsicle.
*  And chat GPT knew who that character was with great specificity.
*  Another example that was actually given to me, and this was the most outrageous example
*  as far as the fanfiction writers were concerned is that there's this sexual trope called the
*  fanfiction writers really like to explore.
*  And it's very, very specific to fanfiction and chat GPT knew all about it.
*  You're not going to tell us any more about it.
*  I'm very confused about it myself.
*  And I'm pretty new to fanfiction.
*  From what I've read, there's like tentacles involved and it's, I don't think it's appropriate
*  for the podcast.
*  Sure, sure, sure, sure.
*  The point is, is there's no reason an AI machine would know about it unless it had read and
*  ingested their fanfiction writing.
*  Right.
*  Why would chat GPT know anything about this unless it was scraping fanfiction?
*  But Shira, aren't these fanfiction writers posting stuff that's fair game?
*  Right.
*  They don't have copyright.
*  I mean, they know they don't have copyright protections, but they still feel really wounded.
*  They're affronted at the idea that these machines have scraped what is for them very much a
*  labor of love.
*  Some of the fanfiction writers I spoke to had spent decades doing this.
*  They had done it as a form of therapy.
*  They had done it as an act of love towards the movies and television shows that they
*  felt creatively inspired by.
*  And they felt like these machines are essentially attacking the very spirit of human creativity
*  that they had been prolific about online.
*  Hmm, right.
*  This is not necessarily their full-time job.
*  This is not how they make money.
*  But you're saying it taps into in some ways, kind of who they are.
*  It's part of their identity.
*  And so on a moral level, they can't tolerate chat GPT just like stealing it.
*  Right.
*  Many of them have day jobs where they make money, but their love, their passion is going
*  into this fanfiction.
*  And they've established these really interesting internal rules on these forums where they
*  post where if one person imitates another or borrows from another without attribution,
*  it's considered outrageous.
*  They are booted from the community.
*  They are excommunicated.
*  They really have a lot of honor in how they operate online and they want that to be respected
*  by these machines.
*  And so in lieu of that, they've had to get really, really creative about how they rebel
*  or how they revolt against these AI systems.
*  And how creative have they gotten?
*  What are they doing?
*  Right.
*  So I mean, for instance, one of the first sort of protests they launched is they got
*  together and started feeding just absolute nonsense into chat GPT.
*  They figured if you're going to scrape our material, we're going to give you total irreverent
*  nonsense to confuse you so you don't understand our characters, you don't understand our storyline
*  and you cannot mimic what we do.
*  So they can't sue, but they can gum up the works.
*  They can basically just like shove sticks and stones into this machine and try to like
*  grind out the gears.
*  Exactly.
*  I mean, they had to think creatively.
*  And so they thought if you want our material, here's our material.
*  We're going to give you nonsense.
*  And does that tactic work?
*  I mean, it can if they do enough of it and they seem pretty committed and passionate
*  about doing this.
*  But, you know, they haven't stopped there.
*  A lot of them have also started making their content private or removing it from the web
*  entirely.
*  And so they're thinking is, you know, until now they've shared all this freely.
*  But if the machines are going to come in and scrape what they do, they're going to start
*  locking it down.
*  Okay.
*  So a lot of these techniques, though, would seem to be pretty counterproductive if you're
*  in the business of creating fan fiction.
*  The first one just creates a bunch of gibberish, which no one wants to read if you like fan
*  fiction.
*  The second one would limit who can view the fan fiction you write.
*  So aren't these rebellions against places like Chatty PT just hurting the fan fiction
*  community?
*  Aren't they just kind of shooting themselves in the foot?
*  I mean, to a certain degree.
*  And a lot of them say they kind of feel like they are in the short term doing something
*  that goes against the entire spirit of fan fiction, but they feel helpless.
*  And so I think at this point, they're just kind of throwing darts at the wall to see
*  what sticks and what works.
*  A lot of them have been in these communities for a long time.
*  And so they're thinking is like, well, I might only get to share my writing with a couple
*  dozen people instead of a couple thousand, but at least the machines won't get me.
*  So it doesn't really feel like either of the two groups share that we've been talking about
*  here, the group with copyright protections and these amateurs who don't have copyright
*  protections.
*  And neither of them seem to be much of a match for these AI platforms and stopping them
*  from scraping their work.
*  So that makes me think that if you're one of these writers, the better solution would
*  be for the US government to step in with some simple regulation that says, Chatty PT, for
*  example, you can't upload this work unless you pay for it.
*  And I know the government is having these conversations.
*  There have been lots of congressional hearings.
*  So is that a possibility?
*  The government says no uploading unless you pay the writers and the creators.
*  Well it's true that the US government is having talks with all these AI companies, but we
*  have to remember that we're still waiting for the US government to take action and come
*  up with some kind of regulation about social media that's been around for over a decade.
*  The US government is very, very slow acting and the vast majority of members of Congress
*  are still wrapping their head around how this technology even works.
*  And so whatever they do is years ahead and it's going to be tempered by the fact that
*  they don't want to hold back these companies too much.
*  Explain that.
*  The US government sees itself in an arms race at the moment against China when it comes
*  to AI.
*  Both China and the United States have a lot of scientists that are invested in this.
*  They have a lot of interest in being the world leaders in artificial intelligence.
*  And so they know that every bit of regulation they put in place potentially holds back those
*  US companies.
*  As opposed to China where there's very little regulation on data and where there's a ton
*  of data online that the Chinese government can easily access and even give to Chinese
*  AI companies if they want to speed ahead in what's considered the sort of AI arms race
*  between the US and China.
*  So the US government might have an interest in actually siding with the AI platforms over
*  the creators because it makes us more competitive against our rivals.
*  Yeah, I mean, they don't want to hamper US AI companies to the point where they fall
*  behind China.
*  Hmm.
*  In which case, it feels like the only way for creative types and for publishing platforms
*  like the Times to fight back is to fight back really on their own for the next however many
*  years.
*  And I'm curious, Shira, if in your reporting you think the complaints of the Sarah Silvermans
*  and these publishing platforms is actually going to make the general public sympathetic
*  and lead to a larger scale pushback against these chat GPT like platforms, or if the reality
*  is just that people like these things, they're excited about them.
*  And that's going to override any of these worries that we're talking about.
*  I mean, look, right now, the people that are angry are the people that can see that their
*  work has been copied or scraped and regurgitated.
*  It's people who are already seeing that the machines have ingested their work and can
*  copy their voices and in a really realistic way.
*  And we don't know what's going to happen going forward.
*  I mean, companies like Google and Facebook are still deciding on how they're going to
*  train their AI.
*  And what happens if Facebook's AI decides to train on your data and can find posts that
*  you wrote 10 years ago when you were in college and sound just like you?
*  Or if Google decides to read your email and your Google Docs and say, hey, this is what
*  Michael sounds like when he's planning a vacation with his family.
*  Is the creepiness factor then that much more that all of us feel like our souls are being
*  replicated by machines?
*  Right.
*  And does that mean that suddenly we are all the fan fiction writer, we are all Sarah Silverman,
*  we are all suddenly seeing these platforms slowly sucking a version of us out and in
*  and giving it to the world in a way that is very weird.
*  Right.
*  Does it become a black mirror episode?
*  It's unclear.
*  But, you know, it could be that these AI systems are so extremely useful and beneficial for
*  our lives that none of us care.
*  Because at one point, people were really mad about Facebook sucking up their data and serving
*  them ads and Google doing the same.
*  And then we ultimately decided that they provided such a useful service that it was okay with
*  us that they sucked up our data.
*  And we're really just in the beginning of this technology.
*  And so we don't know yet.
*  You know, one of the fanfic writers I spoke to actually put it in a really lovely way
*  in that she was in the middle of writing this new piece of fiction.
*  And it happened to be about AI robots versus humans.
*  And she stopped midway through writing it because she didn't want to post it online
*  and feed more into the machine.
*  But she said that where she's stuck and the thought she's really stuck on is that in this
*  piece of fiction she was writing, not every AI robot was bad.
*  Some of them were helpful, some of them were nice, some of them were good, and some of
*  them were evil.
*  And it was really about how the corporations behind those robots use them that decided
*  whether they were good or evil.
*  And so she felt like she just had so many questions about the companies running these
*  AI, and how they're using the data, and how they're going to license it, and what value
*  is going to be.
*  All these questions are swirling around in her head.
*  And it's like, are the robots good or bad?
*  We don't know yet, and so we don't feel comfortable with them.
*  And so did she end up posting any of the story online?
*  No, she has not posted it yet.
*  I think she still has too many questions.
*  Well, Shira, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Monday, Russia said it would end an agreement that had allowed Ukraine to export millions
*  of tons of grain to the rest of the world, threatening global food prices and the food
*  supply in dozens of countries that rely on the grain.
*  The year-old agreement, known as the Black Sea Grain Initiative, was a successful attempt
*  to limit the global repercussions of Russia's war on Ukraine.
*  But Russia has repeatedly complained that the agreement favored Ukraine over its own people.
*  I deeply regret the decision by the Russian Federation to terminate the implementation
*  of the Black Sea Initiative.
*  During a news conference, the head of the United Nations said that Russia's decision
*  would cause unnecessary suffering across the world.
*  Today's decision by the Russian Federation will strike a blow to people in need everywhere.
*  And smoke from wildfires in Canada is returning to the U.S. this week.
*  By Monday afternoon, it was affecting about 72 million Americans across 29 states, from
*  the Dakotas to New York.
*  Nearly 900 wildfires are burning across Canada.
*  Of those, the Canadian government says that more than 500 of them are burning out of its
