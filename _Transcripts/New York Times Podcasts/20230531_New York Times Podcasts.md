# Republicans Impeach One of Their Own

*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Obaro.
*  This is Adelaide.
*  Today, since 2016, the cardinal rule of Republican politics has been to defend Donald Trump
*  and his allies at all costs, no matter what the allegation.
*  So why did Republican lawmakers in Texas just break that rule by voting to impeach the
*  state's far right attorney general?
*  My colleague, David Goodman, explains.
*  It's Wednesday, May 31st.
*  And David Justubian reminds us what Ken Paxson represents to national Republicans across
*  the country.
*  Well, really, Ken Paxson has made himself into a kind of hero of the right.
*  At this point, he's really seen as probably the most effective and certainly the most aggressive
*  of the Republican attorney generals in the country because of the lawsuits that he's
*  been filing over his now three terms in office.
*  He's part of a conservative legal movement that really is hoping and aggressively trying
*  to use the law to pursue policy goals.
*  Another day, another lawsuit on Wednesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxson filed a new
*  one against the federal government.
*  He's filed lawsuit after lawsuit, going back to the Obama era.
*  Texas State Attorney General Ken Paxson is accusing the Obama administration of overstepping
*  its authority when it told public schools to let transgender students use the restrooms
*  that correspond with their gender identity.
*  He's a big thorn on the side of that administration.
*  And then when Trump comes into office, he pivots and he aligns himself with him.
*  Ken Paxson leading a pack of 20 states pushing to get Obamacare officially killed.
*  And he begins filing legal briefs in defense of the policies that the Trump administration
*  is pursuing.
*  The president's latest attempt to overturn the election is a lawsuit brought by Texas
*  Attorney General Ken Paxson.
*  He's out there at the end of 2020 fighting against the results of that election.
*  He's requesting the Supreme Court invalidate results in four swing states by one.
*  And that's something that is a huge political milestone for him.
*  This afternoon, Trump held a conveniently timed lunch with Republican Attorney General,
*  including Ken Paxson.
*  It's what really gets him the enduring support of Donald Trump.
*  It is so awesome to be here.
*  I want you to know that Texas fights.
*  He appears with Trump and speaks at Trump's January 6th rally.
*  Twelve straight lawsuits related to mail-in ballots.
*  We fought.
*  We won every single one of those cases.
*  And because of that, Donald Trump won Texas by over 600,000 votes.
*  And even after Trump's not in office, he's still there defending the Trump administration.
*  He files briefs to try and keep Trump administration policies in place.
*  And then, when he was on the Biden administration, he was able to challenge ending of the Trump
*  Arab policy of Romania, Mexico, which had migrants staying in Mexico while they awaited immigration
*  hearings.
*  And he essentially forced the Biden administration to restart that Trump-era policy.
*  Hmm.
*  Kind of single-handedly.
*  Exactly.
*  And it's not only that he files some suits.
*  He files so many.
*  You know, you'll just find him suing over mask requirements in airports and airplanes.
*  He fought the Biden administration over workplace policies on gender pronouns.
*  And so he's really put himself in the middle of these big fights and really leading the charge
*  on so many of them.
*  He's winning many of them.
*  And even when he's losing, he's forcing a public debate and also a sort of legal coming
*  up the system, a delay in implementation or a reconsideration in some cases.
*  And he's really sort of winning the battle on the right for where the conversation should
*  be.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  And I think David, that is why all of us were so stunned when a few days ago Ken Paxson
*  was suddenly impeached by Republicans who control the Texas legislature because Republicans
*  of Paxson's stature, who are allies of Trump, are by definition defended by fellow Republicans.
*  They aren't impeached by them.
*  They've seen that over and over and over again, no matter how grave the sin that's committed
*  by a Republican.
*  But in this case, that didn't happen.
*  And so we want to understand why in this case, a hero of the Trump wing of the Republican
*  Party was taken out rather than defended.
*  So help us understand why this one played out so differently than we've come to expect.
*  Well, it's really fascinating and took almost everyone in Texas by surprise, primarily
*  because a lot of the things that Ken Paxson has been accused of, people in Texas have known
*  for years.
*  He's been in trouble almost from the moment he took office.
*  He was facing accusations during his first campaign for Attorney General that he had essentially
*  given investment advice without being properly registered to do so.
*  And right after he's elected in 2014, he was indicted for that, a felony crime.
*  And so suddenly you have the newly elected top law enforcement official under felony state
*  indictment.
*  And it doesn't seem like his political career was going to take off in the way that it had
*  at that moment.
*  Right.
*  That does not seem like the best possible start to the time as Attorney General.
*  Right.
*  So it's not even the only thing that he's accused of doing improperly during his first
*  term.
*  And he's also accused of various other sorts of misdeeds.
*  It's most famously in Texas, he was accused of having stolen a $1,000 Mont Blanc pen out
*  of a security line at the local county courthouse.
*  And he's actually seen on surveillance video doing this.
*  And he eventually says it was misunderstanding and returns the pen.
*  But these are the kinds of things that he sort of wrapped up in during his first term.
*  And it makes him seem vulnerable.
*  But at the same time as that's happening, he's kind of wrapping himself in the wing of
*  the Republican Party that is ascendant.
*  And that's, you know, no more more clear than with the election of Donald Trump, where Ken
*  Paxton sees that as the direction of the party is going in.
*  It's really where he is.
*  He's quite a conservative politician as Attorney General and he uses his office to essentially
*  go to bat for the new Trump administration.
*  And by doing so, he's able to make the argument that he's an effective fighter and an ally
*  of a very popular president, at least among Republicans in Texas.
*  And so despite all his troubles, you know, by the time we get to the election of 2018,
*  like his misdeeds are part of the attack ads that are being run against him.
*  You know, the surveillance video of him stealing the pen is an attack ad from his Democratic
*  opponent.
*  But, you know, it just doesn't resonate.
*  And so he goes to voters and he wins the election.
*  Hmm.
*  So Paxton successfully insulates himself against all these political and legal abilities.
*  By telling Republicans, I am your ally of Donald Trump.
*  See me the way you see him.
*  Don't worry about my alleged personal conduct.
*  He elect me and I will champion your cause.
*  That's right.
*  I mean, he really does play into that sort of notion of just fighting for your team and
*  voting for your team.
*  And then we get to 2020 and we sort of have, you know, everything happened again, although
*  much worse for Ken Paxton.
*  Hmm.
*  What do you mean?
*  Well, what ends up happening in 2020 is that many of his most senior aides inside the Attorney
*  General's office come out publicly and accuse him of abusing his office of possibly taking
*  bribes of corruption and requesting a investigation by the FBI.
*  Huh.
*  At issue here are allegations that Ken Paxton used his office to benefit a wealthy political
*  donor who was under investigation by the FBI and also facing a lawsuit.
*  They alleged that he has used the office of Attorney General to benefit a particular
*  friend and donor, a local Austin real estate developer named Paul.
*  The whistleblower lawsuit alleged that Paxton helped Paul gain access to investigative documents
*  that related to the 2019 FBI search of Paul's business and home.
*  And that he has helped this donor.
*  And in return, the donors helped him.
*  The whistleblower alleged that in return Paul gave Paxton $25,000 to his campaign, which
*  allegedly went to remodeling his home and employing Paxton's mistress.
*  So this is really adding up to quite a mess for Ken Paxton.
*  That's right.
*  These top aides are really important voices in sort of conservative legal circles in Texas.
*  These are not folks who are coming from the left.
*  We have been left over from a previous administration.
*  These are folks who are brought in to be sort of part of this fight that Ken Paxton is engaging
*  in against federal government policies.
*  And suddenly you have these folks saying what Ken Paxton is doing with the office is not
*  right.
*  We wouldn't stand for it and we think it might be criminal.
*  And in response, the Attorney General turns around and fires them.
*  Hmm.
*  Basically punishes them for speaking out against them.
*  Right.
*  And it should be said that Ken Paxton has denied that that's the reason that these
*  aides, in many cases, were let go.
*  This is now being disputed.
*  But what's not disputed is that these folks were conservatives who objected to what he
*  was doing.
*  And as his reelection comes up in 2022, once again Paxton is facing a really serious
*  challenge to his political prospects.
*  So much so that the Republican primary in 2022 is just this all-out scrum of different
*  people who think they can beat him.
*  And it's major names from Texas politics, including George P. Bush, the son of Jeb Bush.
*  Well, Texas deserves better.
*  We have an Attorney General that's facing criminal indictment.
*  And Bush during the campaign specifically mentions these legal issues as a way to attack
*  Paxton.
*  And if he's as innocent as he proclaims, then why doesn't he exercise his six amendment
*  right to a speedy trial by his peers?
*  Because we all know the answer.
*  He's guilty.
*  And so during that primary, which is incredibly hard fought, all the different candidates
*  who are major figures in the Republican Party in the state are trying to get Donald
*  Trump's endorsement.
*  They're saying that they should have it and that Ken Paxton really doesn't deserve to
*  stay in that office.
*  And in the end, Trump ends up staying with Ken Paxton.
*  Everyone knows who he is.
*  He's been the most effective Attorney General and we think he's just a great guy.
*  Get out and vote.
*  And it's largely because he's seen Paxton be with him for all these years.
*  And he just sees him as an ally that's been there and then Trump at his most critical
*  moment is there for Ken Paxton.
*  He's done a terrific job for Texas and for our country.
*  And he has my complete and total endorsement.
*  And it's not just Trump.
*  It's like the entire universe of Trump supporters.
*  Greetings to all my America first conservatives in the lone store state.
*  This Trump's son, Don Jr., Ken Paxton is a true fighter who has led the way for the
*  MAGA movement.
*  And so he ends up winning reelection again in 2022.
*  And this time by an even larger margin than he did four years earlier.
*  Wow.
*  So his problems have actually gotten even worse.
*  But his margin of victory has gotten even bigger because he is still wrapping himself
*  quite successfully in the flag of Trumpism.
*  That's right.
*  I mean, he comes out of that election both victorious and feeling aggrieved in this kind of way that's
*  very familiar from the Trump presidency.
*  And during his victory party.
*  So I just want to say the reports of Mike Demise have been greatly exaggerated.
*  He talks about how he's not safe.
*  Just because we won tonight, the fight is not over.
*  They're going to continue to come after me.
*  They're going to continue to come after Texas.
*  They're going to continue to come after Republicans around the country.
*  And that these people, they're going to keep coming after not just him, but his voters,
*  you, the people of Texas that he represents.
*  We're here to fight for individuals.
*  We're here to fight for our neighbors.
*  And I promise you this, we will continue to do that.
*  So God bless you.
*  Thank you for giving me another chance.
*  And he more fully aligns himself with that kind of Trump voter that sees attacks on their
*  favorite politicians as attacks on them personally.
*  And that's something that he sort of draws a line to right after being reelected late last
*  year.
*  And so there's really a feeling that Ken Paxden is in Austin to stay.
*  There's even a joke going around that Texas Capitol that after the nuclear war, there's
*  going to be bees, there's going to be roaches, and there's going to be Ken Paxden.
*  And the idea of that joke is that nothing, I mean, nothing could get Ken Paxden out
*  of the job of Attorney General.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So David, what is it that ends up changing this equation, disrupting this dynamic and this
*  playbook that has been so successful in shielding Paxden from the repercussions of his alleged
*  misconduct?
*  So the thing that really changes everything is that earlier this year, Paxden comes to
*  the state legislature and asks them for millions of dollars to settle his legal dispute
*  with the folks he fired from the office.
*  The former eights who had accused Paxden of misconduct and in some cases were forced
*  out seemingly as a result.
*  Exactly.
*  You know, four of those former deputies actually sued Paxden for wrongful termination.
*  And that case was moving along earlier this year and then they reached a settlement, which
*  is that they dropped the lawsuit if Ken Paxden paid them $3.3 million.
*  And so Ken Paxden went to the state legislature who funds his office and asked them for the
*  money to settle this lawsuit.
*  And the Texas House really boxed this.
*  They don't want to do it.
*  And what we didn't know at the time is that this request for money is what Spurs the
*  House to start investigation into the underlying conduct behind this request.
*  And so they assign former prosecutors to begin looking into the accusations that these
*  former eights have lodged against Ken Paxden.
*  And all this, you know, is happening behind closed doors, you know, unbeknownst to really
*  anyone in the capital besides a small group until last week when this committee of the
*  House has been looking into it comes forward and says, here's what we've been doing for
*  the last few months.
*  And here's what we think should be done about it.
*  We think that he should be impeached.
*  Members.
*  And so a couple of days later on Saturday.
*  Mr. Speaker, I call up the privilege resolution, HR2377, impeaching Warren Kenneth Paxden.
*  There's this very solemn actually gathering of all of the House members in the chamber
*  to debate this for about four hours.
*  I began this week with no idea that the House was considering impeaching the attorney general.
*  Now we are preparing to remove him from office before the day is out.
*  There is no need to rush to judgment.
*  Honor demands that those in authority use their power to try him and remove him from office,
*  not to seek political advantage but out of compunction.
*  May God help us to pass this test that is before us.
*  And ultimately they take a vote to impeach Ken Paxden on 20 articles of impeachment.
*  Have all members voted?
*  They've been 121 hours and 23 nays.
*  The resolution is adopted.
*  Out of the 85 Republican members, 60 of them vote in favor of impeachment.
*  Wow.
*  Which means immediately at that moment Paxden is temporarily removed as a state attorney general.
*  So David, this is the key question.
*  What exactly had changed here?
*  Because Ken Paxden up to this point is still this Maga hero attorney general who has
*  just been endorsed by Donald Trump and Donald Jr.
*  And has been fighting the liberal establishment one lawsuit at a time.
*  So what suddenly inspired these Texas House Republicans to turn on Paxden and go so far as
*  to actually impeach him.
*  Because as you have said throughout this episode, so much of this information has been available
*  for so long.
*  Right.
*  I mean, that was the argument that his defenders were making is that this is not new.
*  In fact, he was just reelected by voters who knew this information only a few months
*  earlier.
*  But what really seems to have changed for the Republicans that voted to impeach was that
*  now Ken Paxden was trying to get them into his mess, essentially.
*  He wanted them to vote for settling a lawsuit based on what he had done.
*  And in a certain sense, as some of the Republicans who spoke during the proceeding said, he was
*  trying to make them complicit in his activities.
*  And I think fascinating.
*  That was the bridge that for many was too far.
*  That this was an attorney general that was now asking them to say you did nothing wrong.
*  And this is okay.
*  Right.
*  Because if they approved that money, they were in a sense approving of his conduct by paying
*  off his accusers as former employees.
*  Right.
*  They would have been part of the effort to essentially cover it up.
*  And they didn't want to be part of that.
*  But there's also something else that play, which is the political character of the Texas
*  House.
*  This is a body that for structural reasons is more moderate.
*  And many of the Republicans who are representatives in it are not as sort of lockstep with what Donald
*  Trump wants or even what that wing of the party wants.
*  It's much more rooted in a more traditional Texas Republican posture.
*  And they have their own voters at home who are in districts that are relatively more suburban.
*  In some cases, a little more urban.
*  And so you have this body that has increasingly found itself really at odds.
*  And sometimes it open political war with the more conservative, more sort of Trump aligned
*  wing of the party in Texas, coming out and making this stand and drawing this line and
*  saying that they're not going to stand for Ken Paxton's accused actions in this instance.
*  If he wants to bring them into it, come what will politically.
*  Right.
*  And demographic reality of these Texas House districts allows these House Republicans
*  to vote to do something that would, to the outside, would look incredibly hard, which
*  is impeached Ken Paxton in this moment.
*  Right.
*  And it really is reflecting this sort of debate that's been reiling the Republican party,
*  which is over the future direction of the party.
*  And really in Texas, this debate is front and center because of the demographic changes
*  and the urbanization that's happening here, you have some Republicans who believe that
*  the party needs to better appeal to the growing cities in this state.
*  And then there are others who believe that no, the party needs to stick closer to its principles,
*  more like what Ken Paxton represents in his lawsuits and what Donald Trump represents
*  in some of his actions.
*  And the House more represents a side that says if we're going to survive, not in two years
*  or five years, but in 10 years in a state that's becoming increasingly urban, increasingly
*  diverse and beat Democrats, we can't go so far in this direction of anything goes.
*  I think it's that debate over where to take the party that is being reflected in this impeachment
*  battle.
*  So David, when we try to understand why the situation went the way that it did, why these
*  60 Texas House Republicans decided to break the rules of the Republican party and do what
*  the vast majority of congressional Republicans refused to do twice when it came to impeaching
*  Trump.
*  We should see their decision in a few ways.
*  First, that they could tolerate Paxton's problems when they were Paxton's problems,
*  but the minute Paxton tried to make it the legislature's problems, they said, enough
*  is enough.
*  Second, because so many of these Texas House Republicans represent moderate districts
*  where voters are not in the thrall of Trump or Paxton, these Republicans are not in the
*  Republicans could afford, politically speaking, to vote their conscience.
*  And finally, it sounds like a lot of these Texas House Republicans saw this vote as having
*  potential political upside because they know Texas is changing and it's becoming bluer.
*  And these House Republicans are kind of looking into the future and are seeing a Texas that
*  will be less red and less beholden to far right Republicans like Ken Paxton.
*  Right.
*  I mean, that really is the open question here, whether these House Republicans are more
*  clearly seeing the direction of the state of Texas than those associated with Ken Paxton,
*  or whether he's in the right about where the party is going.
*  And a lot of this is going to get sorted out relatively quickly.
*  For the summer, there will be a trial of Ken Paxton in the state Senate, which is a
*  much more conservative body than the state House.
*  And if there's not two thirds of senators there to convict him, Ken Paxton will be acquitted
*  and he'll immediately resume the office of Attorney General.
*  And if Ken Paxton is not convicted, if he's acquitted and he goes back to being AG,
*  what's going to happen to those Texas House Republicans who followed their heart and their
*  principles and went out on something of a limb?
*  Well, I think we're really going to test the question of how safe their districts really
*  are for them to take this kind of vote.
*  And I've already heard from people aligned with Ken Paxton that they're looking for a blood
*  bath in the next primary election, that they're going to run Republicans against these House
*  members and they expect to be able to beat them to replace these folks who have been a sort
*  of moderate force in Texas politics.
*  And I think we'll see whether that comes to pass, but really beyond Ken Paxton, what
*  might be the result of all of this is a reshaping of the political dynamic and the forces at
*  play in Republican politics and the largest Republican state in the nation.
*  Right.
*  Because Ken Paxton is promising to use the primary process, the next primary process,
*  to punish these House Republicans who, as you said, think they're in safe districts,
*  but we all know that it doesn't take that many Republican voters to come out and support
*  perhaps a Paxton Trump-backed Republican candidate to make that person the nominee.
*  And if that happens in enough seats across the Texas House, they couldn't have taken
*  out a bunch of these House Republicans.
*  And that would very much change the meaning of Ken Paxton's impeachment because the
*  lesson would be very different than it is right now that these were bold, courageous,
*  House Republicans following principle over party.
*  Instead, this case, this rare exception that broke through rule of Republicans defending
*  other Republicans would end up being a story about why it is very unwise to follow your
*  principle over your party.
*  That's right.
*  This would be a kind of cautionary tale that Republicans who are foolhardy enough to
*  take on someone like Ken Paxton will be punished for doing so, will lose their seat.
*  And what we may end up seeing coming out of this whole impeachment process is a Texas
*  House that no longer acts as a wall or as a kind of last check on the most sort of right-leaning
*  impulses of the party and essentially crumbles.
*  And leaves Texas more fully in the hands of the most conservative, most Trump-aligned,
*  most hardcore elements for some time.
*  Well, David, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Well, thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to another day.
*  Not one Republican should vote for this deal.
*  It is a bad deal.
*  On Tuesday, a hard-right House Republicans were in open revolt over the deal reached by
*  Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Biden to avoid a U.S. default saying that it failed
*  to sufficiently reign in the size of government.
*  The House is expected to pass the deal later today with support from moderates in both parties.
*  But during a news conference, several of the chambers' most conservative Republicans,
*  including Representative Chip Roy of Texas, said they would seek to defeat it.
*  We will continue to fight it today, tomorrow, and no matter what happens, there's going
*  to be a reckoning about what just occurred unless we stop this bill by tomorrow.
*  And at least eight drones targeted Moscow on Tuesday in the first attack to hit civilian
*  areas of the city since the start of Russia's war on Ukraine.
*  Ukraine denied responsibility, but is widely believed to be behind the attacks which appeared
*  intended to instill the same terror in residents of Moscow that Russia has created among residents
*  of Ukraine's capital, Kiev.
