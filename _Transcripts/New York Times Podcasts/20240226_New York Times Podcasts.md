# The Alabama Ruling That Could Stop Families From Having Kids
**New York Times Podcasts:** [February 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RazfLflFzI)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, the story of how a surprise ruling from the Alabama Supreme Court halted fertility
*  treatments across the state and sent a shockwave through the world of reproductive health.
*  I spoke with my colleague, Azeem Gureshi, about the court case itself, and to a patient
*  in Alabama about what it's like to navigate the fallout.
*  It's Monday, February 26th.
*  I think this Alabama ruling really seemed to come almost out of nowhere for a lot of
*  us and in a world where we frequently track court cases and we expect them on a certain
*  date, this didn't fall into that category.
*  It was a genuine legal surprise.
*  So tell us the story behind this case.
*  Yeah, so the actual incident at the center of this case happened in December 2020 at
*  a fertility clinic in Mobile, Alabama.
*  Basically, a person ended up wandering into the storage room of this fertility clinic,
*  which happened to be located in a hospital.
*  They opened a tank where frozen embryos were stored, pulled out a vial and dropped them
*  on the ground, and those embryos were destroyed.
*  These frozen embryos belonged to at least three couples that we know of who were undergoing
*  IVF or in vitro fertilization to try to have a baby.
*  So this is a pretty unusual sounding situation.
*  We don't know why a person was able to get into this room, why they stuck their hand
*  in a tank that was holding frozen embryos at negative 360 degrees Fahrenheit, but the
*  couples in the end filed suit against the fertility clinic and the hospital in which
*  the fertility clinic was located.
*  What should we know about the lawsuit that they filed?
*  So the lawsuit that they filed, I mean, the most important thing to know is that they
*  ended up filing a wrongful death claim.
*  This law in Alabama, the wrongful death of a minor law, was established in 1872 and they
*  argued that the loss of their embryos should fall under that law.
*  Most people don't think of an embryo in a fertility clinic freezer as a baby or as a
*  minor, you mentioned that law.
*  So what's the argument made by these three couples for why that should be the case?
*  So in one of the couple's complaints, they actually described the embryos as, quote,
*  cryopreserved embryonic human beings.
*  They argued that that storage room where the tanks were being held should be considered
*  the same as a daycare facility, which, you know, daycare facilities are protected under
*  state regulations and are required to be safe, secure and closely guarded.
*  And they said, you know, small children, including embryos, cannot protect themselves.
*  So they were really making the argument that the embryos that were destroyed in this incident
*  were essentially their babies and had been killed.
*  I'm curious what we know about the motives of these plaintiffs for using this language.
*  It feels like language we tend to associate with social and religious conservatives who
*  have been trying to redefine when life begins.
*  Do we know if the plaintiffs are part of that movement and do they share its goal?
*  I mean, the fact of the matter is we don't know very much about these plaintiffs.
*  We can't speak to their motivations.
*  I tried to reach out to them and did not hear back.
*  You know, accidents happen in fertility clinics.
*  Often in those cases, patients are either settling with the clinics outside of court
*  or they're bringing negligence cases to be compensated for physical, emotional damages.
*  In this case, we see a completely different strategy.
*  We see these couples bringing a wrongful death suit and they're using very specific language
*  of personhood to make that argument.
*  And obviously the personhood movement in the United States has been seeking to define life
*  as beginning at the very earliest stages in an effort to overturn the right to abortion.
*  And that happened, you know, in 2022 when we saw the fall of Roe v. Wade.
*  And once that ruling fell, a lot of people were wondering what does this mean for IVF?
*  Right.
*  Worrying that basically a case like this, a case like what these plaintiffs are arguing
*  might come along, might gain subtraction.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the logical conclusion to that personhood argument.
*  Okay.
*  So let's turn to what happens to this lawsuit and how we get to this very consequential
*  ruling.
*  So two lower trial courts in Alabama actually rejected that wrongful deaths argument.
*  They said that these embryos should not be considered people.
*  That brought this to Alabama Supreme Court and they made the opposite ruling.
*  They said that actually these embryos should be considered children under Alabama state law.
*  And how does the Alabama Supreme Court explain why it came to that conclusion?
*  So the main judge who issued the opinion wrote that the text of the wrongful death of a minor
*  act is sweeping and unqualified.
*  It applies to all children born and unborn without limitation.
*  And we got even more insight into the court's thinking from some of the concurring opinions.
*  One of the justices wrote, even before birth, all human beings have the image of God and
*  their lives cannot be destroyed without effacing his glory.
*  So they're very much taking the position that according to the Bible, these embryos should
*  be considered human life.
*  Right.
*  According to Alabama law.
*  And according to Alabama law.
*  Yes.
*  So what the justices of the Alabama Supreme Court are saying in this ruling, just to be
*  very clear, is that a fertilized embryo, even outside the uterus, outside the womb, is a
*  full-fledged life with all the legal protections of a baby, a minor, and therefore they're
*  resetting the clock on the entire idea of when life starts to its very earliest conceivable
*  moment.
*  So this is a narrow ruling.
*  This applies to the three couples in this case whose embryos were destroyed.
*  But it sets a huge and quite scary precedent for anyone who is undergoing IVF, anyone who
*  works in the fertility industry in Alabama, who is working with these embryos that are
*  suddenly considered children.
*  Just explain that.
*  Accidents happen in fertility clinics.
*  Sometimes an embryo sticks to the side of the pipette.
*  Sometimes problems happen with shipping.
*  Sometimes a biopsy is taken for genetic testing and it goes wrong.
*  I mean, there are many, many ways that these embryos can be damaged as a result of going
*  through this process.
*  And suddenly this ruling just raises the stakes tremendously and opens up a whole suite of
*  new questions about how fertility care can even be provided in the state of Alabama.
*  Right, because suddenly everyone involved in the chain of custody of an embryo involved
*  in IVF could very logically worry that they could end up being entangled in a wrongful
*  death lawsuit for something that, based on what you're saying, might be just a routine
*  accidental end of an embryo's existence.
*  Yes.
*  Okay, so practically speaking, on the ground, what end up being the repercussions of that
*  ruling in Alabama?
*  Pretty much immediately after this ruling came out, there was, I would say, complete
*  pandemonium.
*  You have fertility clinics that are suddenly looking at basically all their processes for
*  how they do things, wondering what their liability is going to be now that all of these embryos
*  could be considered children under Alabama state law.
*  And then there are the people who are currently in the middle of undergoing fertility treatment
*  who don't know whether they can proceed.
*  People who had retrievals scheduled to retrieve eggs from their body, people who are waiting
*  to have embryos transferred to see if they will actually implant.
*  And so this puts all fertility treatment in Alabama into limbo.
*  I think people just don't know what's going to happen next.
*  Last week, not long after the Alabama ruling, we got an email from a woman in Birmingham.
*  Her name is Megan Cole.
*  She told us she's a 31-year-old lawyer and that she's in the final stages of IVF treatment.
*  On the day she wrote us last Wednesday, she said her embryos were scheduled to be implanted
*  in a surrogate just two days later.
*  So I called her and asked her to tell us her story.
*  Why don't you just start just kind of at the beginning about, you know, your experience
*  and what it's been like to watch this thing come down and how you kind of fit into this
*  and how it's affecting what I understand from your email to be like a pretty in-process
*  situation that you're in with your surrogate.
*  Sure.
*  So back in high school, I was diagnosed with a super rare blood disorder.
*  So between the disorder and the medications that I'm on, I can't safely carry, you know,
*  my own pregnancy.
*  Wouldn't be safe for me, wouldn't be safe for the baby.
*  And, you know, that was something that was devastating and something that I had to get
*  over and realize, okay, like it is what it is and maybe I'm just not meant to, you know,
*  have my own child.
*  And then I learned about surrogacy and so that kind of gave me hope, which obviously
*  that entails going through IVF.
*  So last year I went through two rounds of IVF and we were finally matched with a surrogate
*  back in November and for two rounds of IVF alone, it cost us around 24,000.
*  And then, you know, when you add surrogacy on top of that, it's going to equal about
*  $250,000 all in.
*  And we are currently scheduled for an embryo transfer on Friday.
*  And so, you know, last week we're chugging along, everything's great.
*  And then I get an email blast and read the opinion and was shocked.
*  Why were you shocked?
*  Just explain that.
*  I just didn't think that this was even like an issue or a thought.
*  I didn't think that frozen embryos would ever be considered like a living child outside
*  of a uterus.
*  I mean, they're frozen clusters of cells.
*  They can't live outside of the freezer.
*  And so I just, I didn't realize that someone would rule this way.
*  And how quickly did it become a question of your own circumstance?
*  Very quickly.
*  So after the shock kind of, you know, settled in, then I realized, oh, we have a transfer
*  schedule.
*  Are the clinics going to be kind of paralyzed because they don't know what this ruling
*  means for them?
*  And are they going to continue with normal business?
*  So that was obviously a concern.
*  And then today, actually, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, UAB, issued a note
*  saying that they're pausing all IVF.
*  So at that point, I really got scared.
*  So we're talking to you like at 4pm Eastern time on Wednesday.
*  And what exactly is the state of communication you're having with the clinic?
*  You know, I know my clinic is inundated with calls right now.
*  And so I haven't been able to get in touch with them to kind of see what the status is.
*  But you know, we're scheduled for Friday, and I'm just going to assume that it's going
*  forward until I hear otherwise.
*  So basically, the biggest day of your life is ambiguous at this moment.
*  Like, will your pregnancy begin?
*  Will I be having a kid in nine months or will I not be?
*  We've wanted a child for so long.
*  And now that we're almost here, you know, and I'm sorry, I don't want to like tear up.
*  To think that a Supreme Court decision could now take away my ability to fulfill my dream
*  of having a child, my own child is like really upsetting to me.
*  So talk a little bit about your understanding of how this decision might affect you.
*  And is there a universe where it doesn't affect you?
*  Right, right.
*  I think there is a situation where I'm not affected.
*  I mean, it's not like the court said you can't do IVF and you can't do any transfers.
*  And so I think there is a universe and I think maybe I am currently in that universe where
*  everything does go forward on Friday.
*  But yeah, I'm in limbo right now and it's really scary.
*  Well, why don't we just keep checking in with you and we can just kind of keep trying to
*  understand where things stand.
*  Okay, that sounds good.
*  Thank you so much for calling.
*  Okay, bye.
*  Bye.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Azeem, we just spoke with a woman, Meg, who is in the final phase of the IVF process
*  with a surrogate.
*  Her transfer was scheduled for Friday, February 23rd.
*  And when we spoke with her, she said the entire process is now uncertain.
*  She has no idea if it's going to move forward.
*  I'm curious how many people in Alabama are in that kind of situation now and what their
*  options are if they're involved in IVF in the state.
*  So here's what we know.
*  There are at least five IVF clinics in the state of Alabama.
*  They performed at least 1200 IVF procedures in 2021.
*  Since the ruling came out, pretty much in rapid succession, we started hearing from
*  clinics that said they were shutting down some or all of their IVF procedures.
*  It started with the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
*  Which we should say, by the way, Meg, when she heard about that, was really spooked.
*  Yep.
*  And then just yesterday, we found out that the Center for Reproductive Medicine in Mobile,
*  so that's the fertility clinic at the center of this suit, is also shutting down operations.
*  And a third clinic has also announced that as well.
*  So now there are three major fertility clinics in Alabama saying they aren't moving forward
*  with IVF treatments.
*  They're basically just shutting the whole thing down.
*  They're shutting the whole thing down.
*  Because they fear liability.
*  Because they fear liability.
*  Because all of a sudden, these embryos that they're handling could be considered people
*  under state law.
*  Well, so if you're somebody trying to do IVF in Alabama, you have your fertilized eggs
*  frozen in one of these clinics that have paused their work, what can you do?
*  What should you do?
*  I mean, I think people are sort of panicking and wondering how they can possibly move forward.
*  I mean, one option would be get your embryos out of the state.
*  Ship them out.
*  Ship them out to another fertility clinic out of state that can proceed with your transfers.
*  But my colleague just reported that one of the biggest embryo shipping companies has
*  just said that they too don't want to accept the liability that this new ruling imposes
*  on them.
*  In case they were to be involved in damaging an embryo.
*  In case something happens in the process of shipping, could they be held liable under
*  this interpretation of the wrongful death statute in Alabama?
*  So everyone is spooked.
*  What could this mean for their personal responsibility in handling these embryos?
*  So it feels safe to say that in Alabama, this ruling has pretty much brought the entire
*  IVF world or most of it to a grinding halt.
*  And I think the question for people outside of Alabama is what are the chances that a
*  ruling like the one that happened there could happen elsewhere in the country, especially
*  as you explained earlier, Azeen, in a world where there isn't Roe v. Wade, which had been
*  viewed as a kind of legal buffer against efforts to go after something like IVF.
*  So my colleague Sarah and I actually spoke with head of a fertility clinic in Iowa who
*  said I feel for the patients and the fertility providers in the state of Alabama.
*  I do not think that this is going to be limited to that state.
*  In a state where there is a six week abortion ban on the books, it's being challenged right
*  now.
*  But I think fertility providers across the country are worried about what this could
*  possibly mean for them in states that have made it clear that they want to ban abortion.
*  There is, of course, an irony here, which is that we think of the personhood debate
*  as primarily being around abortion and ending pregnancies.
*  IVF is about creating pregnancy.
*  It's about creating life babies.
*  So it would seem like something that social and religious conservatives would embrace,
*  not try to restrict.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, what you just described is the split that we're currently seeing play out in the
*  Republican Party.
*  Many Republicans are saying that they oppose this decision.
*  They're trying to distance themselves from it.
*  I mean, you have Mike Pence, who went through IVF with his wife, has been outspoken about
*  it saying that, you know, IVF needs to be protected.
*  Mike Pence being a very prominent social conservative.
*  We have legislators even in the state of Alabama saying that IVF needs to be protected in that
*  state.
*  And, you know, they know that most Americans, including Republicans, support IVF for the
*  reason that you said it's helping people start families.
*  But the reality is that the extreme elements of the anti-abortion movement in this country
*  are ecstatic about this ruling.
*  The Alliance Defending Freedom has said that this is a tremendous victory for life.
*  This really supports the arguments that they have been pushing for decades to try to ban
*  abortion.
*  So that is a tension that's playing out in the conservative world.
*  It's really unclear as of now whether IVF will become the same kind of battleground
*  in this country that abortion has become.
*  We have good reason to think that it won't because of the popularity of IVF.
*  But what we do know is that that extreme point of view has prevailed in Alabama, and that
*  has very real consequences for fertility patients in that state.
*  Azeem, thank you very much.
*  Thanks, Michael.
*  Hey, this is Megan.
*  Hey, Megan, it's Michael Barbaro.
*  How are you?
*  Hey, how are you?
*  I'm good.
*  So as promised, we wanted to check back in with you.
*  Yes.
*  And it's now Friday, the 14th of July, and we're going to be having a very special
*  So I wonder if you can just catch us up on what's happened since we last spoke with you
*  a couple days ago.
*  Sure.
*  So later on that night, like at seven o'clock, I got a response, but it was kind of like
*  lawyer response and a very much of we don't really know yet what's going on.
*  You know, we'll be in touch as we figure things out.
*  So after I got that, I just sent an email directly to my doctor and I said, you know,
*  you got to shoot me straight.
*  What's going on?
*  Is the transfer going forward?
*  And then about 20 minutes after I sent that email, I saw my clinic's number pop up on
*  my phone and instantly knew that it was going to be bad news.
*  And our doctor said, I'm so sorry, but you know, it has to be canceled.
*  I instantly broke down in tears.
*  I don't think I've ever cried that hard in my life.
*  My husband is very outgoing and very talkative and could talk to anyone.
*  And he was basically silent, you know, for 20, 30 minutes.
*  He just didn't know what to say and was trying to process this decision and the cancellation
*  of the transfer that we've been waiting for for over a year.
*  And then, you know, I called our surrogate and had to break the news to her, the person
*  who'd been taking hormone medications for the last three weeks and dealing with that
*  while also dealing, you know, with her own family and had to break that news.
*  And she was obviously devastated as well.
*  After you processed this, after you got off the phone with the surrogate, what was going
*  through your head?
*  It was, how are we going to make this happen?
*  How are we going to get these embryos out of this state and have our transfer move forward?
*  But as of now, we are unable to move our embryos out of the state because the clinics
*  are worried that there might be destruction of an embryo, you know, obviously through
*  the process of transporting them out of state.
*  And that could open them up to liability.
*  It could open us up to liability.
*  So that was not an option either.
*  So your clinic is saying you can't use your embryos because of this ruling.
*  And it's also saying because of this ruling, you can't move your embryos.
*  It's basically for now shutting down your options to conceive a child.
*  I mean, the only option would be for me to go through an IVF cycle out of state, my third
*  IVF cycle, get those embryos frozen, genetically tested again.
*  The whole process.
*  I mean, redo the whole process, which would cost us another $30,000.
*  And that wouldn't be something that we would be able to do immediately.
*  I mean, that would take at least another year.
*  Right.
*  Which every, every, when you're in this process, every day seems like a year.
*  We've been waiting and waiting to have a child and we were on the cusp.
*  And so the thought of having to wait, you know, another year or even another six months
*  is really hard for us.
*  How did you end up spending this day, Friday, the day where you thought that you were going
*  to begin a journey towards having a child and instead you didn't because of this ruling?
*  I mean, I spoke with my mom, my dad and my sister all today.
*  One thing that my sister said, you know, is she's been angry as well.
*  And she said, it feels like a death in the family.
*  Like we were all excited to have the possibility that a child would be coming into our family.
*  And she said, you know, it feels like a death.
*  Do you feel that way?
*  I do in the sense of, it feels like a death of our dream to become parents.
*  You know, we were almost there.
*  And so now that dream has, it seems less obtainable at this moment.
*  Megan, thank you for sharing all this with us.
*  Of course.
*  In our first conversation and now in this second one.
*  And I wish you and your husband the very best.
*  Yeah, no problem.
*  Thank you.
*  Over the weekend, both Democratic and Republican lawmakers in Alabama, including its conservative
*  governor, Kay Ivey, said they would consider legislation to protect IVF treatments from
*  the court's ruling.
*  But so far, it's unclear when such legislation would be voted on and whether there's enough
*  support for it to pass.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  I was just informed that we got double the number of votes that has ever been received
*  in the great state of South Carolina.
*  So that's pretty good.
*  In his latest victory in the Republican primary, Donald Trump soundly defeated Nikki Haley,
*  his only remaining opponent in her home state of South Carolina, by 20 percentage points.
*  The outcome, Haley's fourth straight defeat to Trump, solidified Trump's status as the
*  party's de facto nominee.
*  I just want to say that I have never seen the Republican Party so unified as it is right
*  now.
*  Never been like this.
*  And a Manhattan jury has found that the leaders of the NRA, the country's most powerful gun
*  rights group, engaged in a years-long pattern of financial misconduct and corruption.
*  The verdict amounted to a public rebuke of the organization's longtime CEO, Wayne LaPierre,
*  who resigned from the NRA last month.
*  During the trial, it was revealed that LaPierre had used NRA funds to pay for millions of
*  dollars in personal expenses, including high-end clothing, yacht rides, and luxury flights
*  for himself and his family.
