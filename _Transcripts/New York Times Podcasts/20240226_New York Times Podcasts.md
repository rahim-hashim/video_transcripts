*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Barrow.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, the story of how a surprise ruling from the Alabama Supreme Court halted fertility
*  treatments across the state and sent a shockwave through the world of reproductive health.
*  I spoke with my colleague, Azean Garasi, about the court case itself and to a patient in
*  Alabama about what it's like to navigate the fallout.
*  It's Monday, February 26th.
*  I think this Alabama ruling really seemed to come almost out of nowhere for a lot of us.
*  And in a world where we frequently track court cases and we expect them on a certain date,
*  this didn't fall into that category.
*  It was a genuine legal surprise.
*  So tell us the story behind this case.
*  Yeah.
*  So the actual incident at the center of this case happened in December 2020 at a fertility
*  clinic in Mobile, Alabama.
*  Basically, a person ended up wandering into the storage room of this fertility clinic,
*  which happened to be located in the hospital.
*  They opened a tank where frozen embryos were stored, pulled out a vial, and dropped them
*  on the ground.
*  And those embryos were destroyed.
*  These frozen embryos belonged to at least three couples that we know of who were undergoing
*  IVF or in vitro fertilization to try to have a baby.
*  And so this is a pretty unusual sounding situation.
*  We don't know why a person was able to get into this room, why they stuck their hand in
*  a tank that was holding frozen embryos at negative 360 degrees Fahrenheit.
*  But the couples in the end filed suit against the fertility clinic and the hospital in which
*  the fertility clinic was located.
*  And what should we know about the lawsuit that they filed?
*  So the lawsuit that they filed, I mean, the most important thing to know is that they
*  ended up filing a wrongful death claim.
*  This law in Alabama, the wrongful death of a minor law was established in 1872 and they
*  argued that the loss of their embryos should fall under that law.
*  Hmm.
*  Most people don't think of an embryo in a fertility clinic freezer as a baby or as a minor,
*  you mentioned that law.
*  So what's the argument made by these three couples for why that should be the case?
*  So in one of the couples complaints, they actually described the embryos as, quote, cryopreserved
*  embryonic human beings.
*  They argued that that storage room where the tanks were being held should be considered
*  the same as a daycare facility, which, you know, daycare facilities are protected under
*  state regulations and are required to be safe, secure and closely guarded.
*  And they said, you know, small children, including embryos, cannot protect themselves.
*  So they were really making the argument that the embryos that were destroyed in this
*  incident were essentially their babies and had been killed.
*  I'm curious what we know about the motives of these plaintiffs for using this language.
*  It feels like language we tend to associate with social and religious conservatives who
*  have been trying to redefine when life begins.
*  Do we know if the plaintiffs are part of that movement and do they share its goal?
*  Mm-hmm.
*  I mean, the fact of the matter is we don't know very much about these plaintiffs.
*  We can't speak to their motivations.
*  I tried to reach out to them and did not hear back.
*  You know, accidents happen in fertility clinics often in those cases.
*  Patients are either settling with the clinics outside a court or they're bringing negligence
*  cases to be compensated for physical, emotional damages.
*  In this case, we see a completely different strategy.
*  We see these couples bringing a wrongful death suit and they're using the very specific
*  language of personhood to make that argument.
*  And obviously the personhood movement in the United States has been seeking to define life
*  as beginning at the very earliest stages in an effort to overturn the right to abortion.
*  And that happened, you know, in 2022 when we saw the fall of Roe v. Wade.
*  And once that ruling fell, a lot of people were wondering what does this mean for IVF.
*  Right.
*  We're wearing that basically a case like this, a case like what these plaintiffs are arguing
*  might come along, might gain subtraction.
*  Yeah, it's the logical conclusion to that personhood argument.
*  Okay, so let's turn to what happens to this lawsuit and how we get to this very consequential
*  ruling.
*  So two lower trial courts in Alabama actually rejected that wrongful death's argument.
*  They said that these embryos should not be considered people that brought this to Alabama's
*  Supreme Court.
*  And they made the opposite ruling.
*  They said that actually these embryos should be considered children under Alabama's state
*  law.
*  And how does the Alabama Supreme Court explain why it came to that conclusion?
*  So the main judge who issued the opinion wrote that the text of the wrongful death of
*  a minor act is sweeping and unqualified.
*  It applies to all children born and unborn without limitation.
*  And we got even more insight into the courts thinking from some of the concurring opinions.
*  One of the justices wrote, even before birth, all human beings have the image of God and
*  their lives cannot be destroyed without effacing his glory.
*  So they're very much taking the position that according to the Bible, these embryos should
*  be considered human life.
*  Right.
*  And according to Alabama law.
*  And according to Alabama law, yes.
*  So what the justices of the Alabama Supreme Court are saying in this ruling, just to be
*  very clear, is that a fertilized embryo, even outside a uterus outside the womb, is a
*  full-fledged life with all the legal protections of a baby, a minor.
*  And therefore they're resetting the clock on the entire idea of when life starts to its
*  very earliest conceivable moment.
*  So this is a narrow ruling.
*  This applies to the three couples in this case whose embryos were destroyed.
*  But it sets a huge and quite scary precedent for anyone who is undergoing IVF, anyone who
*  works in the fertility industry in Alabama, who is working with these embryos that are
*  suddenly considered children.
*  Just explain that.
*  That's happened in fertility clinics.
*  Sometimes an embryo sticks to the side of the pipette.
*  Sometimes problems happen with shipping.
*  Sometimes a biopsy is taken for genetic testing and it goes wrong.
*  I mean, there are many, many ways that these embryos can be damaged as a result of going
*  through this process.
*  And suddenly this ruling just raises the stakes tremendously and opens up a whole suite
*  of new questions about how fertility care can even be provided in the state of Alabama.
*  Right.
*  Because suddenly everyone involved in the chain of custody of an embryo involved in IVF
*  could very logically worry that they could end up being entangled in a wrongful death
*  lawsuit for something that, based on what you're saying, might be just a routine accidental
*  end of an embryo's existence.
*  Yes.
*  Okay.
*  So practically speaking, on the ground, what end up being the repercussions of that ruling
*  in Alabama?
*  Pretty much immediately after this ruling came out, there was, I would say, complete
*  pandemonium.
*  You have fertility clinics that are suddenly looking at basically all their processes
*  for how they do things, wondering what their liability is going to be now that all of these
*  embryos could be considered children under Alabama state law.
*  And then there are the people who are currently in the middle of undergoing fertility treatment
*  who don't know whether they can proceed, you know, people who had retrieval scheduled
*  to retrieve eggs from their body, people who are waiting to have embryo's transfer to
*  see if they will actually implant.
*  And so this puts all fertility treatment in Alabama into limbo.
*  I think people just don't know what's going to happen next.
*  Last week, not long after the Alabama ruling, we got an email from a woman in Birmingham.
*  Her name is Megan Cole.
*  She told us she's a 31-year-old lawyer and that she's in the final stages of IVF treatment.
*  On the day she wrote us last Wednesday, she said her embryos were scheduled to be implanted
*  in a surrogate just two days later.
*  So I called her and asked her to tell us her story.
*  Why don't you just start just kind of at the beginning about, you know, your experience
*  and what it's been like to watch this thing come down and how you kind of fit into this
*  and how it's affecting what I understand from your email to be like a pretty in-process
*  situation that you're in with your surrogate.
*  Sure. So back in high school, I was diagnosed with a super rare blood disorder.
*  So between the disorder and the medication that I'm on, I can't safely carry, you know,
*  my own pregnancy.
*  When we say for me, when we say for the baby, and you know, that was something that was devastating
*  and something that I had to get over and realize, okay, like it is what it is and maybe I'm just not
*  meant to, you know, have my own child. And then I learned about surrogacy and so that kind of gave me hope,
*  which obviously that entailed going through IVF.
*  So last year I went through two rounds of IVF and we were finally matched with a surrogate
*  back in November and for two rounds of IVF alone it cost us around 24,000 and then, you know,
*  when you add surrogacy on top of that, it's going to equal about $250,000 all in.
*  Yep.
*  And we are currently scheduled for an embryo transfer once Friday.
*  And so, you know, last week we're chugging along everything's great and then I get an email
*  from the doctor and read the opinion and was shocked.
*  Why were you shocked just to explain that?
*  I just didn't think that this was even like an issue or a thought.
*  I didn't think that frozen embryos would ever be considered like a living child outside of a uterus.
*  I mean, they're frozen clusters of cells.
*  They can't live outside of the freezer.
*  And so I just, I didn't realize that someone would rule this way.
*  And how quickly did it become a question of your own circumstance?
*  Uh, very quickly.
*  So after the shock kind of, you know, settled in, then I realized, oh, we have a transfer schedule.
*  Are the clinics going to be kind of paralyzed because they don't know what dispooling means for
*  them and are they going to continue with normal business?
*  So that was obviously a concern.
*  And then the day actually the University of Alabama at Birmingham, UAV,
*  it's you to know saying that they're pausing all IVF.
*  So at that point, I've really got scared.
*  So we're talking to you, like at 4 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday.
*  And what exactly is the state of communication you're having with the clinic?
*  You know, I know my clinic is inundated with calls right now.
*  And so I haven't been able to get in touch with them to kind of
*  see what the status is.
*  But you know, we're scheduled for Friday.
*  And I'm just going to assume that it's going forward until I hear otherwise.
*  So basically, the biggest day of your life is ambiguous at this moment.
*  Like will your pregnancy begin?
*  Will I be having a kid in nine months or will I not be?
*  We've wanted a child for so long.
*  And now that we're almost here, you know, and I'm sorry, I don't want to like hear
*  but to think that a Supreme Court decision could now take away my ability to fulfill my dream
*  of having a child, my own child is like really upsetting to me.
*  So talk a little bit about your understanding of how this decision might affect you.
*  And is there a universe where it doesn't affect you?
*  Right, right.
*  I think there is a situation where I'm not affected.
*  I mean, it's not like the court that you can't do IVF and you can't do any transfer.
*  And so I think there is a universe and I think maybe I am currently in that universe where
*  everything does go forward on Friday.
*  But yeah, I'm in limbo right now and it's really scary.
*  Well, why don't we just keep checking in with you and we can just kind of keep
*  keep trying to understand where things stand?
*  Okay, that sounds good.
*  Thank you so much for calling.
*  Okay, bye.
*  Bye.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So I mean, we just spoke with a woman, Meg, who is in the final phase of the IVF process with a
*  surrogate.
*  Her transfer was scheduled for Friday, February 23rd.
*  And when we spoke with her, she said the entire process is now uncertain.
*  She has no idea if it's going to move forward.
*  I'm curious how many people in Alabama are in that kind of situation now and what their
*  options are if they're involved in IVF in the state.
*  So here's what we know.
*  There are at least five IVF clinics in the state of Alabama.
*  They performed at least 1200 IVF procedures in 2021.
*  Since the ruling came out pretty much in rapid succession, we started hearing from clinics that
*  said they were shutting down some or all of their IVF procedures.
*  It started with the University of Alabama, Birmingham.
*  Which we should say by the way, Meg, when she heard about that was really spooked.
*  Yep.
*  And then just yesterday, we found out that the Center for Reproductive Medicine and
*  Mobile, so that's the fertility clinic at the center of this suit, is also shutting down
*  operations.
*  And a third clinic has also announced that as well.
*  So now there are three major fertility clinics in Alabama saying they aren't moving forward
*  with IVF treatments.
*  And so this is just shutting the whole thing down.
*  They're shutting the whole thing down.
*  And so because they fear liability.
*  Because they fear liability.
*  Because all of a sudden, these embryos that they're handling could be considered people
*  under state law.
*  Well, so if you're somebody trying to do IVF in Alabama, you have your fertilized eggs frozen
*  in one of these clinics that have paused their work. What can you do? What should you do?
*  I mean, I think people are sort of panicking and wondering how they can possibly move forward.
*  I mean, one option would be get your embryos out of the state.
*  Ship them out.
*  Ship them out to another fertility clinic out of state that can proceed with your transfers.
*  But my colleague just reported that one of the biggest embryo shipping companies has just said
*  that they too don't want to accept the liability that this new ruling imposes on them.
*  So in case they were to be involved in damage.
*  In case something happens in the process of shipping, could they be held liable under this
*  interpretation of the wrongful death statute in Alabama? So everyone is spooked.
*  What could this mean for their personal responsibility in handling these embryos?
*  It feels safe to say that in Alabama, this ruling has pretty much
*  brought the entire IVF world or most of it to a grinding halt.
*  And I think the question for people outside of Alabama is, what are the chances that a ruling
*  like the one that happened there could happen elsewhere in the country, especially as you
*  explained earlier, is in a world where there isn't roe v Wade, which had been viewed as a kind of
*  legal buffer against efforts to go after something like IVF.
*  Mm-hmm. So my colleague Sarah and I actually spoke with
*  ahead of a fertility clinic in Iowa who said, I feel for the patients and the fertility providers in
*  the state of Alabama, I do not think that this is going to be limited to that state.
*  She's in a state where there is a six week abortion ban on the books
*  being challenged right now. But I think fertility providers across the country are worried about
*  what this could possibly mean for them in states that have made it clear that they want to ban abortion.
*  There is of course an irony here, which is that we think of the personhood debate as
*  primarily being around abortion and ending pregnancies. IVF is about creating pregnancy.
*  It's about creating life babies. So it would seem like something that social and religious
*  conservatives would embrace, not try to restrict. Yeah, I mean what you just described is the split
*  that we're currently seeing play out in the Republican Party. Many Republicans are saying that they
*  oppose this decision. They're trying to distance themselves from it. I mean, you have Mike Pence
*  who went through IVF with his wife has been outspoken about it saying that IVF needs to be protected.
*  Mike Pence being a very prominent social conservative. Yes, we have legislators even in the
*  state of Alabama saying that IVF needs to be protected in that state. And they know that most
*  Americans, including Republicans, support IVF for the reason that you said it's helping people
*  start families. But the reality is that the extreme elements of the anti-abortion movement in this
*  country are ecstatic about this ruling. The Alliance Defending Freedom has said that this is a
*  tremendous victory for life. This really supports the arguments that they have been pushing for decades
*  to try to ban abortion. So that is a tension that's playing out in the conservative world.
*  It's really unclear as of now whether IVF will become the same kind of battleground in this country
*  that abortion has become. We have good reason to think that it won't because of the popularity of
*  IVF. But what we do know is that that extreme point of view has prevailed in Alabama. And that has
*  very real consequences for fertility patients in that state. Asine, thank you very much. Thanks, Michael.
*  Hey, this is Megan. Hey, Megan, it's Michael Barbaro. How are you?
*  Hey, how are you? I'm good. So as promised, we wanted to check back in with you.
*  Yes. And it's now Friday afternoon. This was the day that your transfer was scheduled to happen.
*  So I wonder if you can just catch us up on what's happened since we last spoke with you a couple
*  days ago. Sure. So later on that night, like at seven o'clock, I got a response, but it was kind
*  of like a lawyer response. And very much of we don't really know yet what's going on. You know,
*  we'll be in touch as we figure things out. So after I got that, I just sent an email directly to
*  my doctor and I said, you know, you got to shoot me straight. What's going on is the transfer
*  going forward. And then about 20 minutes after I sent that email, I saw my clinic's number pop
*  up on my phone and instantly knew that it was going to be bad news. And our doctor said,
*  I'm so sorry, but it has to be canceled. I instantly broke down in tears. I don't think I'd ever
*  cried that hard in my life. My husband is very outgoing and very talkative and could talk to
*  anyone. And he was basically silent, you know, for 20, 30 minutes. He just didn't know what to say.
*  And was trying to process this decision and the cancellation of the transfer that we've been
*  waiting for for over a year. And then, you know, I called our surrogate and had to break the news
*  to her. The person who's been taking hormone medications for the last three weeks and dealing
*  with that while also dealing, you know, with her own family and had to break that news. And she was
*  obviously devastated as well. After you process this, after you got off the phone with the surrogate,
*  what was going through your head? It was how are we going to make this happen? How are we going to
*  get these embryos out of this state and have our transfer move forward?
*  But as of now, we are unable to move our embryos out of the state because the clinics are worried
*  that there might be destruction of an embryo, you know, obviously through the process of transporting
*  them out of state. And that could open them up to liability. It could open us up to liability.
*  So that was not an option either. So you're clinic is saying you can't use your embryos because
*  of this ruling. And it's also saying because of this ruling, you can't move your embryos. It's
*  basically for now shutting down your options to conceive a child. I mean, the only option would be
*  for me to go through an IVF cycle out of state, my third IVF cycle, get those embryos
*  frozen, genetically tested again. The whole process. I mean, redo the whole process, which would
*  cost us another $30,000. And that wouldn't be something that we would be able to do immediately.
*  I mean, that would take at least another year. Right. Which every every when you're in this
*  process every day seems like a year. We've been waiting and waiting to have a child and we were
*  on the cuffs. And so the thought of having to wait, you know, another year or even another six
*  months is really hard for us.
*  How did you end up spending this day Friday, the day where you thought that you were going to begin
*  a journey towards having a child. And instead, you didn't because of this ruling.
*  I mean, I spoke with my mom, my dad and my sister all today. One thing that my sister said, you know,
*  she's been angry as well. And she said it feels like a death in the family. Like we were all excited
*  to have the possibility that a child would be coming into our family. She said, you know, it feels
*  like a death. Do you feel that way? I do in the sense of it feels like a death of our dream
*  to become parents. You know, we were almost there. And so now that dream has, it seems less
*  obtainable at this moment.
*  Oh, Megan, thank you for sharing all this with us. Of course.
*  And our first conversation to now in this second one. And I wish you and your husband
*  the very best. Yeah, no problem. Thank you.
*  Over the weekend, both Democratic and Republican lawmakers in Alabama, including its conservative
*  governor, Kay Ivy, said they would consider legislation to protect IVF treatments from the courts
*  ruling. But so far, it's unclear when such legislation would be voted on and whether there's
*  enough support for it to pass.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. I was just in front of that we got double the number of votes
*  that has ever been received in the great state of South Carolina. That's pretty good. So it's a
*  latest victory in the Republican primary. Donald Trump soundly defeated Nikki Haley,
*  his only remaining opponent in her home state of South Carolina by 20 percentage points.
*  The outcome, Haley's fourth straight defeat to Trump, solidified Trump status as the party's
*  de facto nominee. I just want to say that I have never seen the Republican party so unified
*  as it is right now. Never been like that.
*  And a Manhattan jury has found that the leaders of the NRA, the country's most powerful gun rights
*  group, engaged in a year's long pattern of financial misconduct and corruption. The verdict
*  amounted to a public rebuke of the organization's longtime CEO Wayne Lopier, who resigned from the NRA
*  last month. During the trial, it was revealed that Lopier had used NRA funds to pay for millions of
*  dollars in personal expenses, including high end clothing, yacht rides, and luxury flights for
*  himself and his family.
