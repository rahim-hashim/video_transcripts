# Why the Race to Replace George Santos Is So Close
**New York Times Podcasts:** [February 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP5xTBQ9RVM)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Today voters in New York will choose the successor to George Santos, the disgraced Republican
*  who was expelled from Congress in December.
*  Democrats would seem to have the advantage.
*  Instead, it's a dead heat.
*  My colleague Nick Fandos explains why and tells me how the results of the race will
*  hold important clues for both parties come November.
*  It's Tuesday, February 13th.
*  So Nick, you've been following the race for the seat formally occupied by George Santos.
*  And setting aside Santos's brief and kind of riveting congressional tenure, I'd like
*  to start with the most basic question, which is why does this race over this one house
*  seat on Long Island matter?
*  It's a great question.
*  Now, I'd start by saying, let's not just so quickly race over George Santos.
*  This was a guy whose year-long embarrassment put this district on the map, I think left
*  a lot of voters there really exacerbated.
*  I mean, it is probably the reason why you and I are talking right now.
*  That's very true.
*  But we're also talking because this is a really special district.
*  We're talking about a slice of Queens and Long Island that is racially diverse, ethnically
*  diverse, got people of all kinds of socioeconomic statuses.
*  And as such, it's the type of place that we see all over the country where elections are
*  probably going to be decided later this year for president and for control of the House
*  of Representatives.
*  This area has swung back and forth a lot.
*  President Biden won this district by eight points in 2020.
*  And then two years later, in 2022, George Santos was one of a handful of Republicans
*  who flip seats right here in New York that helped the Republican Party take the majority
*  in the House.
*  I remember that.
*  That was a big election that Republicans just had a wipeout in New York.
*  Yeah.
*  And when Santos was expelled in December, this race becomes a really big deal for both
*  parties.
*  And there's a couple of reasons for that.
*  If the Democrats can win and flip this seat, they could narrow Republicans' majority right
*  now in the president at a time when they're trying to impeach the Homeland Security Secretary
*  or fund the government and make their life a lot more difficult.
*  But it also was a race that's going to set the tone for the rest of 2024 and give the
*  parties kind of an early preview of where the elections are headed.
*  For all of those reasons, Democrats feel like this is a really good pickup opportunity
*  for us.
*  And also, they're coming out of the Santos train crash.
*  So it's logical they would think that.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  But instead, as we head into Election Day today, we're looking at a statistical dead
*  heat.
*  And Nick, what's your understanding of why the race is so close?
*  I think that there's really two issues that have come to dominate this race above anything
*  else.
*  One of them is a big international issue that has a kind of particular local resonance.
*  And that's the war unfolding right now in Gaza.
*  So this is one of the most Jewish districts in the country.
*  And a lot of voters are looking very closely at both candidates and how they're approaching
*  this.
*  The other one is an issue that's in headlines and conversations in Washington and all over
*  the country right now.
*  And that is the situation at the southern border, where we've seen a historic influx
*  of migrants trying to cross and the Biden administration is struggling to figure out
*  what to do about it.
*  OK, so let's talk about the candidates and how they're dealing with those issues.
*  So introduce me to the Republican.
*  Right.
*  So the Republican in this race is a woman named Mazie Pilop.
*  The future of our nation is at stake in this race for the third congressional district
*  on February 13.
*  She's a local part-time legislator in Nassau County with relatively little political experience.
*  And this is shown on the campaign trail.
*  She's really not doing a lot of public events.
*  She doesn't speak in an unscripted way.
*  A lot of her positions, frankly, have been hard for us to hash out.
*  But in this particular moment, she has a really remarkable personal story that I think she's
*  been able to kind of deftly use in the campaign.
*  I grew up in Israel.
*  Israel for me, a special place.
*  So she was actually born in Ethiopia and as a young child was airlifted to Israel where
*  she grew up.
*  I got my education.
*  I served in the Israeli army very proud.
*  And served as a member of the Israeli Defense Forces.
*  Wow.
*  So she served in the military.
*  She did, yeah, and has family members who still live over there.
*  My family, my entire family live in Israel.
*  My nephews, as we speak, fighting the terrorists.
*  She married a Ukrainian-American doctor, moved to New York and settled on Long Island.
*  Yeah, and she said very explicitly that October 7th changed her in a very significant way.
*  For me, this is so personal, so painful.
*  It propelled her to want to run in this race.
*  This is attack on the world.
*  So we have to remember, we have to be strong and I'm Israel.
*  Hi, thank you.
*  To confront both what she sees as anti-Israel sentiment and anti-Semitism creeping up all
*  around the world and in American politics, particularly, she says, on the left of the
*  Democratic Party.
*  And how does she present what she would do on Israel?
*  I mean, who is she in terms of the policy stuff with Israel?
*  Yeah, so she is a very staunch defender of Israel, you wouldn't be surprised.
*  She doesn't want to put any condition on American aid to Israel.
*  She thinks a ceasefire is a deeply unjust solution.
*  She in fact has gone so far since October 7th that she now says a two-state solution,
*  a Palestinian and Israeli state, is no longer even possible.
*  Oh, wow.
*  It should just all be Israel.
*  So that's very different than, you know, President Biden's position, for example.
*  That's right.
*  And it's one of the few things that separates her from her Democratic opponent on this issue.
*  So tell me about her Democratic opponent.
*  Who is he?
*  All right, everybody.
*  Well, my name is Tom Swazi and I'm running for the United States Congress.
*  So the Democrat in this race is Tom Swazi.
*  He's a really well-known Democrat locally.
*  He's been around for 30 years.
*  He was the Nassau County executive and he was in fact a three-term member of Congress
*  representing this very seat.
*  In my case, you've got somebody that you know, somebody who's been around, somebody who's
*  got a proven record of getting things done.
*  Before he decided to run for governor, it didn't go so well and Santos got elected.
*  And on this issue, he's presented himself as as staunchly pro-Israel as Pilip is.
*  He doesn't want to condition aid.
*  He's against a ceasefire.
*  Okay, I got to Israel about seven hours ago to show solidarity with our friends here in
*  And even in this incredibly short campaign, he took time out to fly over to Israel to
*  prove his bona fides.
*  It reminds us that evil exists in the world and we have to stand strong and defeat this
*  terrorist operation.
*  Okay, so clear why they're both doing that because it's a very Jewish district.
*  But why is this an issue in this district at all then?
*  They're both pretty similar.
*  I think there's two parts to understanding this.
*  One is the unique appeal of Pilip's story.
*  So remember how I said she was in the IDF?
*  She's also an Orthodox Jew.
*  She has seven kids who she says she's worries about facing anti-Semitism in the United States.
*  She has family in Israel.
*  Our brothers and sisters got attacked by a terrorist organization.
*  She has made concerns about this issue visceral in her campaign, a centerpiece of her campaign
*  in a way that frankly I haven't really seen another candidate do out on the trail.
*  I promise you the Jewish people, the state of Israel, the American people will make you
*  pay the price you deserve.
*  And so she's basically giving Jewish voters who are uncomfortable or nervous in this moment
*  feel like historically unsettled.
*  An opportunity to vote for someone like them and somebody who is really going to go to
*  Congress and be a voice.
*  Nobody doubts that this is going to be a centerpiece of her identity in Congress.
*  And at the same time, Swazi is dealing with this other problem, which is not so much about
*  him but about his party.
*  There's a concern right now, I think among a lot of American Jews and a lot of voters
*  that I've talked to in this race and rabbis, that the Democratic Party's left flank has
*  become increasingly skeptical or even hostile to Israel.
*  And so they may be fine with Tom Swazi, but they're just really worried about voting
*  for Democrats at all right now.
*  They either want to make a protest or punish the party because they don't like the direction
*  that it's going.
*  And what's his message to them?
*  Yeah, so Swazi is directly addressing this and saying, actually, I agree with you, but
*  that's the reason you've got to elect me.
*  Another Republican that supports Israel is not adding much to the equation.
*  You don't need another super strong pro-Israel Republican.
*  We've got plenty of those.
*  You need somebody that is going to stand up and get in the trenches and fight with
*  his own party.
*  That's how we put up a bulwark against this, is within the Democratic Party.
*  What we need are strong, outspoken, pro-Israel Democrats that will stand up for Israel and
*  will stand up to the extreme left.
*  And I'm the guy to do that.
*  I am uniquely set up to fight exactly the force that you are most afraid of, which is
*  progressives on the left side of the Democratic Party.
*  Exactly.
*  And in my reporting, I've seen all kinds of signs that voters are really kind of torn
*  over this.
*  In the middle part of the district, and this is where Pilip is actually from, you have
*  a really large population of Orthodox Jews and Iranian Jews who have become very politically
*  conservative in recent years.
*  And her campaign is banking on the fact that they are going to be super motivated and come
*  out with huge numbers.
*  And that matters in a low turnout election.
*  There's also a group of voters that are just diehard Democrats.
*  They're Jews.
*  They might be concerned about Israel, but they can't support her because of her ties
*  to the Republican Party and Trump or whatever the reason.
*  But there seems to be a kind of contingent in the middle of moderate to liberal American
*  Jews who maybe would have sided with Democrats who have been an important part of their coalition
*  for a long time that are now looking a lot more closely at this choice.
*  I've talked to rabbis who are describing congregations that are pretty split down the middle.
*  Jewish voters who say they don't know which way to go.
*  They like Swazi personally, but they've never seen a candidate quite so outwardly Jewish
*  as Pilip is.
*  And so frankly, I don't think we're going to know the answer until later today as to
*  how all of this broke down.
*  But in a race that's really, really close, this group actually has the potential to swing
*  it one way or the other.
*  It's pretty interesting.
*  I mean, the people in the middle, had it not been for October 7th, perhaps they would have
*  just voted for the Democrat because that's kind of maybe how they tended to vote.
*  But now October 7th has kind of made this chemical reaction and it's a little bit of
*  a wild card.
*  We don't know what's going to happen.
*  Right.
*  There are a lot of issues that I think is being watched by political strategists all
*  over the country who are wondering, okay, what could this mean potentially in other
*  districts?
*  Have the foundations of American politics been shaken so hard that Republicans can drive
*  a wedge between Jewish voters and Democrats?
*  And that could potentially have a real impact across the country.
*  And as if that wasn't enough, remember, this district is going to offer us a second
*  test case on something that is arguably even a bigger issue right now, and that's immigration.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Nick, tell me about how immigration is shaping this race.
*  So let me start by just zooming out for a second.
*  Since the pandemic, there has been an incredible buildup of people from Venezuela, Latin America,
*  other countries trying to cross the southern border.
*  And it's become a big issue in Washington right now.
*  Last week, we saw President Biden and Congress really tangling over a potential border deal.
*  And it's become one of the biggest issues for the 2024 campaign as well.
*  Former President Trump has made clear that this is the issue that he wants to run on,
*  one of the ones that he really thinks he can beat President Biden up on.
*  And so on a national level, this issue is kind of everywhere at the moment.
*  But there's an unusual resonance, I think, here in New York and in this district in particular
*  as well.
*  Now, I've been on the show before talking about the migrant crisis here in New York.
*  And all those people streaming over the southern border, 170,000 of them and counting, have
*  come here to New York City.
*  And it's been a huge quandary for the city and for the state and the Democrats who run
*  New York.
*  It's been expensive.
*  The mayor has talked about having to slash the budget.
*  And all of that is kind of playing out in this district.
*  There's actually a migrant shelter that the city has erected that sits squarely in the
*  congressional district.
*  And a lot of voters in it are commuting into the city all the time and maybe are seeing
*  people lined up outside of hotels.
*  And if nothing else, they're reading all kinds of daily headlines.
*  Just last week, the police commissioner of New York was talking about a migrant crime
*  wave in New York City, all of which is kind of suggesting chaos and chaos under Democrats
*  watch, both in Washington and in New York.
*  OK, so where do we see this play out on the campaign?
*  So this issue starts to show up in polls very early in this race as a top priority of voters.
*  But I think the moment that it really crystallized on the campaign trail that this thing, that
*  immigration is going to be the center of this campaign, was a couple of weeks ago when Mazie
*  Pilip, the Republican candidate, decided to have her first major press conference of the
*  campaign outside that migrant shelter in Queens.
*  My name is Mazie Pilip.
*  I'm a legal immigrant and a candidate for Congress.
*  She shows up.
*  She introduces herself as a legal immigrant before she even said she's the Republican
*  candidate for Congress.
*  The third congressional district residents worry about our border crisis.
*  And talked about basically how bad things have gotten on Democrats watch.
*  She says he created this problem.
*  He's been for sanctuary cities in the past.
*  Like the crisis that we have here right now, it's their fault.
*  And I'm the one that'll make it better.
*  So she's saying, I came here the right way, legally, these people didn't, and all of this
*  is happening under Democrats.
*  Exactly.
*  So this looks like a typical kind of Republican issue, right?
*  It's the things that Republicans are doing all over the country right now.
*  But the really kind of wild thing that happens is Swazie finds out that this is going to
*  happen and he gets in his car and drives to the migrant shelter himself.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And sets up a press conference right next to her so that when she wraps up, he steps
*  up to the microphones and says,
*  As we saw in the press conference that my opponent was going to be minutes ago, she
*  didn't give any solutions.
*  She recounted why it's a problem.
*  We all know it's a problem.
*  Some of us have been talking about it for decades.
*  Hi, I'm the Democrat in this race and I agreed this is a total problem for this district.
*  The key to solving problems, complicated problems, is compromise.
*  You got to get both sides to cut a deal.
*  That's the only way you can solve these problems.
*  But here's how I would deal with it.
*  I want to find a bipartisan solution and my opponent isn't going to do that.
*  So he basically wants to show everybody he's no less tough on the issue than she is.
*  He's like, OK, I see your press conference.
*  I'll raise you mine.
*  But like, what's he really doing here?
*  Yeah, it's a striking moment because I think that we are used to in the kind of political
*  world thinking of immigration as an issue that Republicans attack on and Democrats either
*  stay quiet or try to ignore it.
*  And here you have the Democratic candidate really diving headfirst into an issue that
*  polls show voters are blaming his party for.
*  In some ways, this is really kind of typical for somebody like Tom Swazi, who's a centrist
*  who likes to buck his party.
*  But I think it also reflects that he learned an important lesson from 2022 when Republicans
*  perform much better here in New York than they did in the rest of the country.
*  And they did it in part by really speaking to and kind of channeling fears about rising
*  crime in New York.
*  And Democrats, by their own admission, didn't take it seriously enough.
*  And they ceded it to Republicans.
*  Swazi saw that and his takeaway was, this can't be a Republican issue or a Democratic
*  issue.
*  This is an issue that voters care about and that they're talking about.
*  And if I don't dive into it and show them that I'm taking it seriously and trying to
*  solve it, well, then yeah, I am going to be politically washed out with President Biden
*  and other Democrats who are getting the blame.
*  So he's really trying to both kind of separate himself from his party here in an important
*  way and dive into an issue that we've seen Democrats pretty uncomfortable grappling with.
*  Which in a way is a pretty bad sign for national level Democrats, right?
*  Including Biden heading into November.
*  Like that a Democrat in a swing district of a blue state is running away from his own
*  party's position on immigration.
*  But that's also a pretty tricky needle for him to thread.
*  Yeah, no doubt, especially in a special election where, by the way, candidates usually win
*  and lose based on their ability to turn out their most loyal voters.
*  Normally you're not reaching across the aisle.
*  But I think that Swazi is finding himself having to do this is emblematic of just how
*  bad this issue is for Democrats and how bad their brand has become in a place like the
*  suburbs of New York City.
*  Remember Biden won this district pretty easily four years ago.
*  But now in the latest polling in this race, and I'm talking to voters out in the field,
*  it's quite clear that Biden's numbers have dropped precipitously.
*  In fact, he's trailing Donald Trump and head to heads here in the suburbs.
*  And a large part of that has to do with immigration.
*  Voters seem to be very exercised about the sense of this issue being out of control and
*  Democrats, the ones that they put in power, not doing enough about it.
*  And so if Pilip is trying to make this race into basically a referendum on President Biden
*  and the Democratic Party vis-a-vis immigration, what Swazi is trying to do is make it a battle
*  between Tom Swazi, the Democrat, and Mazie Pilip, the Republican, over who's got the
*  better idea to help solve this problem.
*  He's saying, yeah, I agree with you that we have a problem, but let's argue about the
*  way to fix it and get voters to really focus in on that.
*  And in that area, he may have gotten some help last week.
*  You're referring to the deal that the Republicans actually wanted and then bailed on at the
*  last minute, this deal in the Senate on immigration.
*  That's right.
*  So Swazi is able to go out and say, look, here's a bipartisan solution that Democrats
*  agreed to give Republicans almost everything that they wanted.
*  There's some money for the wall.
*  There's money to speed up and change the asylum process.
*  We can increase deportations.
*  This is the kind of thing that's going to help us solve the problem in the country.
*  This is the kind of thing that I'd support.
*  So when his Republican opponent comes out and trashes it and says, this is a legalization
*  of the invasion that we're seeing in the border, Swazi moves really quickly to say, okay, you
*  remember my Republican was telling you this was a really big problem.
*  Now she seems to be putting politics over solving that policy problem because President
*  Trump and her party would rather not give President Biden the victory.
*  Basically saying, look, this is a pretty cynical political move.
*  They're using it for their own political gain instead of actually trying to fix the problem.
*  Exactly.
*  And how does PILIP respond to that?
*  PILIP responds by basically doubling down and saying, why should we trust you on the
*  solution when you arguably helped create this problem in the first place?
*  And this is where Swazi runs into some trouble with that long record of his.
*  It turns out when you've been in politics for 30 years, you accumulate a record that's
*  pretty easy to go in and pluck things out of to support an argument like this.
*  So national Republicans and the PILIP campaign have been airing millions of dollars of ads
*  that showed he voted with Biden 100% of the time when he was still in Congress.
*  So it really connects him to the president on all kinds of issues.
*  And then there's this one ad in particular that has been running over and over and over again.
*  Illegal immigrants arriving by the buzz load.
*  Why?
*  Because Tom Swazi repeatedly weakened America's borders.
*  That includes a clip of Swazi during his ill-fated run for governor a couple of years ago.
*  When I was county executive in Nashville County, I kicked ice out of Nashville County.
*  Bragging on a debate stage about how he kicked ice, that is immigration and customs enforcement,
*  out of Nassau County when he was county executive.
*  Essentially a pro-immigration stance.
*  Right. That's how it looks.
*  In Congress, he'll make it worse.
*  Congressional leadership on his response before the country to decentralizing.
*  Now, Swazi has explained he had good reason.
*  The ICE officers pulled guns on Nassau County police officers.
*  But when you really get under the data and talk to strategists that are working on this race,
*  that ad has taken a real bite out of Swazi's image and seems to be helping PILIP
*  undermine voters trust in his ability to solve the problem.
*  So we've also seen in polls that voters who care the most about the border,
*  and that's a plurality of voters as you said, trust PILIP more than they trust Swazi.
*  Okay. So given all of this, of course, we're not going to know the answer until tonight
*  when we get the election results.
*  But Nick, just casting a little bit ahead here, say the Republican wins, say PILIP wins.
*  What should Republicans take away from that?
*  What's the lesson there?
*  Republicans took a big hit last week for pulling out of that bipartisan immigration deal
*  that they themselves demanded and helped negotiate.
*  But they did it for a reason, arguably.
*  They did it because it is a very good political issue for them and they want to run their 2024 campaigns on it.
*  And if they end up being successful in this race, which is really kind of the very first test of that strategy,
*  I think it may tell them that that was worth it, at least politically,
*  and that this is the path that they ought to continue going down,
*  both as they run against President Biden, but also in Senate and House races all over the country
*  where things are close and voters may be similarly disposed to blame the Democrats for it.
*  And on the other hand, if Mazie PILIP loses and Swazi wins,
*  while I don't think that we'll see Republicans completely abandon immigration as an issue by any means,
*  I think they're going to have to take a hard look at the kind of suite of issues that they're running on
*  and whether that alone is enough to get candidates across the finish line in these tough districts.
*  And Nick, what about the Democrat?
*  I mean, what if Swazi wins?
*  What would that tell Democrats?
*  So Swazi, if he can win, would essentially be writing a playbook for Democrats across the country.
*  And I think it would go something like this.
*  Keep pounding your Republican opponent on abortion and Trump and issues like that.
*  But you can't ignore the issues that Republicans really like either.
*  You got to dive in in the mud and start wrestling with them.
*  And if you can separate yourself from President Biden a little bit along the way,
*  or you can otherwise show you're willing to push against party orthodoxy,
*  then voters might just reward you for that.
*  They might look at you and say, OK, this is the kind of politician who might be able to help solve problems for us.
*  Let's give them a shot.
*  And on the other hand, if having done all of that, a candidate like Tom Swazi,
*  who entered this race well known and well liked,
*  he had a Democratic registration advantage and a lot more money than his Republican opponent,
*  can't pull this out, I think that's going to be a very potent warning sign for President Biden and his party
*  that this fall is going to be one heck of a fight.
*  Nick, thank you.
*  My pleasure, Sabrina.
*  In a troubling sign for turnout in Tuesday's special election,
*  heavy snow was forecast in the New York metro area over the day on Tuesday,
*  with some areas expected to receive up to two inches an hour.
*  A significant storm could create even greater uncertainty
*  in a contest whose outcome is likely to be decided by a small margin.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Monday, Israel's military said it had conducted a wave of attacks on the southern
*  Gazan city of Rafa to provide cover for soldiers undertaking a hostage rescue mission there.
*  Israeli special forces raided a large area of the city,
*  Israeli special forces raided a building there before dawn,
*  freeing two hostages held by Hamas.
*  The Gazan Health Ministry said at least 67 Palestinians had been killed.
*  The ministry's figures do not distinguish between combatants and civilians.
*  The operation was met with elation in Israel and was a major boost for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*  But for Palestinians, it carried a sense of foreboding that a broader Israeli operation
*  to capture the city was beginning.
*  Netanyahu has ordered the military to draw up plans to evacuate civilians from Rafa.
*  But aid groups say there is no place left for them to go.
*  And a judge in Atlanta said that he would move ahead with a hearing later this week,
*  delving into a romantic relationship between the two prosecutors
*  who are leading an election interference case against Donald Trump and his allies.
*  The revelations about the relationship have created turmoil around the case,
*  one of several against Trump involving the 2020 election and his alleged efforts to subvert it.
*  The defense is trying to get the two prosecutors, Fonny Willis,
*  the Fulton County District Attorney, and Nathan Wade, whom she hired to run the case, disqualified,
*  arguing that the relationship gives the appearance of impropriety and would lead to an unfair prosecution.
