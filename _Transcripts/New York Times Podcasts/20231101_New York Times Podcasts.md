# Lessons From an Unending Conflict
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-QUtn1Te_4)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi.
*  And this is The Daily.
*  This morning in Stepanakert, the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, the government of Azerbaijan
*  said it had mounted a counter-terrorist operation, but the ethnic Armenians who live here saw
*  it as an unprovoked and opportunistic attack.
*  In late September, one of the world's most intractable conflicts ended, causing tens
*  of thousands of Armenians to flee their homes.
*  On the streets of Stepanakert, panic took over as mortars pounded its surroundings.
*  Overwhelmingly, the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, now a defeated people, have decided it's safer
*  to flee their homeland than live under Azerbaijani rule.
*  Today, my colleague Andrew Higgins, on how that conflict started, why it lasted for more
*  than 30 years, and what its end can tell us about the nature of seemingly insolvable disputes.
*  It's Wednesday, November 1st.
*  So, Andy, I want to start by breaking the third wall here to say you and I actually
*  recorded a version of this episode, and I was looking back at my calendar just now to
*  see when we actually did that.
*  It was October 6th, and the team had the episode ready to go for that Monday, but then that
*  weekend, Hamas militants crossed into Israel and our attention shifted to another part
*  of the world, and we did not actually run the episode.
*  Yeah, exactly, and put what we were talking about in a slightly less important place.
*  However, I think what we were talking about is very instructive and important when it
*  comes to conflict and the nature of conflict.
*  How it begins, and most importantly, how it can end, right?
*  So we're now returning to this topic because, you know, other than the struggle between
*  Israel and the Palestinian territories, this conflict, the one we've recorded the episode
*  about, the one between Azerbaijan and Armenia, was considered the most intractable conflict
*  in the world.
*  That is, up until about a month ago, when suddenly, almost out of the blue, it ended
*  quickly and quite brutally.
*  So let's talk about this conflict, Andy, how it became so intractable, how it ended,
*  and what that tells us about the nature of conflict.
*  Where does that story start?
*  What the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan, like that between Israel and the Palestinians,
*  is one over territory.
*  And like Israel-Palestine, diplomats have been talking around and around this issue,
*  how to solve it.
*  And they got absolutely nowhere.
*  Multiple meetings, multiple summits, all failed.
*  And then last month, it was, in quotation marks, solved through a military assault,
*  which obviously has maybe not implications, but echoes for Israel-Palestine.
*  I mean, can the Israel-Palestine dispute over territory be solved by force?
*  Okay, so let's walk through the first part of that conflict between these two countries,
*  Azerbaijan and Armenia, and start, Andy, back at the time when the Soviet Union was still
*  alive.
*  Take me through, in very simple terms, the basics of it.
*  Yeah, it all starts in the waning years of the Soviet Union, the late 1980s.
*  Remember, the Soviet Union was the largest land empire on earth, and it comprised 15
*  separate republics, each with its own people, but they were all Soviets.
*  And two of these were Armenians and Azerbaijanis, who lived side by side, not always harmoniously,
*  but Soviet power kept long historic grievances under wraps, kept them from basically attacking
*  each other.
*  Armenia was, by some counts, the oldest Christian civilization, surrounded on all sides by Muslim
*  countries, to the west by Turkey and to the east by Azerbaijan and south by Iran.
*  And when the Soviet Union starts to fall apart under Mikhail Gorbachev, all these mountains
*  and valleys of difference suddenly start coming to the surface.
*  And Mikhail Gorbachev, at this point, trying to hold this vast country together, goes down
*  there and pleads for them, both the Armenians and the Azerbaijanis, to remember they are
*  Soviet citizens, first and foremost, and that they should put their differences aside
*  and basically avoid open conflict.
*  And does that work?
*  No, it fails completely.
*  These tensions are bubbling up steadily.
*  And in 1990, they erupt in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, where there is a large population
*  of ethnic Armenians.
*  And suddenly, the Azerbaijani Muslim population turn on their Christian neighbors and, in
*  many cases, friends.
*  And there's a horrific pogrom in Baku in the early years of 1990, when Armenians are basically
*  hunted through the streets and, in some cases, killed by their neighbors.
*  And this sets the stage for even more violence.
*  There was a small enclave of ethnic Armenians that remained within the newly formed republic,
*  which became a state, a separate state, of Azerbaijan.
*  And this place was called Nagorno-Karabakh.
*  This enclave was very, very important to the Armenians.
*  It contained many of their oldest churches and seen as sort of the cradle of Armenian
*  civilization.
*  And in one particularly bad incident in Hojaly, a town in Nagorno-Karabakh, the Armenians,
*  in retaliation for what's happened in Baku and elsewhere, turned on the Azerbaijanis.
*  And this leads to a massacre which leaves hundreds dead.
*  And this is probably the worst single massacre of civilians during the whole conflict.
*  And by 1993, and here we're two years after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991,
*  what had begun as a local dispute between two different peoples has become a full-scale
*  war between two states, the newly declared states of Azerbaijan and Armenia.
*  Okay, so this war between these two new countries has its front line in a place called Nagorno-Karabakh.
*  And that place has lots of Armenians and includes many of their most cherished religious sites.
*  But it sits within the territory of Azerbaijan.
*  What did that war look like in its first phase, Andy?
*  At this stage, the two new countries are very unbalanced in terms of strength.
*  Azerbaijan is a shambles, political chaos, constant turmoil in Baku, the capital, and
*  Armenia is more organized and has a far more disciplined, effective army, and moves very
*  quickly to basically destroy the Azerbaijan military.
*  And they take not only Nagorno-Karabakh, this area of territory which is inhabited by ethnic
*  Armenians, but a large chunk of territory between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia proper.
*  So by 1994, when this war ends with a ceasefire, Armenia has not only Nagorno-Karabakh, but
*  a large wide swath of Azerbaijani territory.
*  And what was the feeling among the Armenians at that point, Andy?
*  At this point, the Armenians are exultant.
*  They are euphoric at their victories over what an enemy they despise as weak and disorganized.
*  Many people, I suppose, who compare it to the feeling Israelis had after the 1967 war
*  when they conquered Jerusalem.
*  There was this idea that the Armenians were the sort of Spartans of the region, that they
*  were all conquering and there was nothing anyone could do to stop them.
*  And what about the Azeris, Andy?
*  Well, the mood in Azerbaijan, which I visited this time, was one of absolute despondency.
*  The government was falling apart and in 1993 it fell, bringing in a new leader, the former
*  KGB chief of the region, who slowly, brutally began to put the house in order.
*  And by no means did the Azeris give up on what they had lost.
*  In fact, this became a festering wound.
*  And for all leaders of Azerbaijan, since the loss of Nagorno-Karabakh, the only issue that
*  would prove that they were successful was whether or not they got back Nagorno-Karabakh.
*  So it created this terrible, terrible, deep wound that coursed through Azerbaijan for decades.
*  So terrible wound for the Azeris.
*  It's like a little piece of glass in their heel as they walk along.
*  What about the outside world?
*  How do people see this?
*  Well, the outside world looked at this and realized that this wound had to be healed.
*  And why did the world care about the wound?
*  Well, the Americans cared after the collapse of the Soviet Union because they needed and
*  wanted to show that the end of communism, the end of dictatorship, the end of basically
*  a police state, did not mean just a wasteland of endless conflict, that there was some hope
*  to be had from the end of the Communist Party rule.
*  So they were very determined to basically have a success or at least not a total bloody
*  failure in this part of the world.
*  And for the Russians, it was important because they considered this their turf.
*  And they saw themselves as the ultimate guardians of peace.
*  And they wanted to show that they could bring about some sort of peace.
*  And at the same time, both the Americans and the Russians at this time, unlike today, were
*  working very closely together.
*  In many ways, they were both on the same page.
*  Diplomats who were involved at that time look back very fondly at those days when they said
*  they had very good relations with the Russian and American colleagues.
*  And they were sort of working together to try and solve this problem.
*  Not that they got anywhere, though.
*  So everybody had a stake in wanting this festering wound to be healed.
*  What did they do?
*  Well, everyone also had a plan.
*  They drew up roadmaps, came up with five-point plans, eight-point plans, got the leaders
*  and diplomats of Azerbaijan and Armenia to sit down at various talks, roundtable talks,
*  square table talks.
*  And they all got nowhere.
*  The most famous push in all these diplomatic efforts came in 2001 with George W. Bush,
*  who had just come into the White House.
*  And he was looking for what he thought might be a simple, easy diplomatic triumph.
*  Little did he know.
*  No, he bit off a lot more than he could chew.
*  And he and Colin Powell, Secretary of State at the time, organized this meeting in Key
*  West, Florida.
*  After months of preparation, they thought they might be able to solve the problem and
*  finally cut this Gordian knot that had tormented so many of their predecessors.
*  They got the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia to go to Key West.
*  And yet again, the effort failed and left such a bitter taste in George Bush's mouth
*  that he supposedly told aides, please never mention Nagorno-Karabakh to me ever again.
*  So diplomacy was really no match for these underlying tensions, the right to the land,
*  the language, the religion, and the conflict basically bumped along but in a frozen form.
*  But it was still seething underneath the surface, right?
*  So when did that start to change?
*  The conflict itself has not changed, but the world around it has completely changed after
*  the Key West debacle.
*  Azerbaijan, which in the early part of this dispute was a shambolic mess, is now an organized
*  basically police state with lots and lots of money coming in thanks to oil and gas,
*  which it's developed largely with the help of Western companies.
*  And it's using a lot of this money to buy weapons.
*  And this military, which before was just laughed at by the Armenians, is now becoming a serious
*  fighting force.
*  And at the same time, Armenia is sort of stuck.
*  Its politics is sort of frozen and stagnant, and it's not a rich country.
*  It's a small country.
*  But it has nothing like oil or gas to sustain a major military buildup.
*  So it's falling behind Azerbaijan militarily.
*  So basically they're trading places, right?
*  Azerbaijan is rising economically and Armenia is largely stuck in place.
*  How does that power shift change the weather in the war?
*  What does it do to this frozen conflict?
*  Well, alongside this dramatic economic trading of places is a very serious hardening of the
*  regime in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, which is run at this point by the son of the
*  previous leader who came to power with little experience, few of the connections of his
*  father and was basically fairly insecure.
*  But he reaches out to ethnic nationalism as the way to consolidate his position.
*  And he starts stoking fairly vicious hatred of Armenians generally and of Armenians living
*  in Nagorno-Karabakh in particular.
*  Like he's insecure.
*  He needs a tool to prove to the people of Azerbaijan that he knows what he's doing and
*  he's important and he's powerful, that they should listen to him.
*  So he grabs the ethnic nationalist lever.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  Ethnic nationalism in this part of the world and many other places is basically the first
*  refuge of a political scoundrel.
*  And the president, the new president, started to use increasingly violent rhetoric, either
*  himself or through his proxies and the media outlets he controlled, whose message was basically
*  the only good Armenian is a dead Armenian.
*  And this culminated in 2004 when an Azerbaijani officer who had been sent to a NATO training
*  exercise in Hungary, which was also being attended by Armenian military officers.
*  And one night, this Azerbaijani officer went out and bought an axe.
*  This is in the capital of Hungary, Budapest.
*  And he went back to the dormitory, broke into the Armenian soldier's room and hacked him
*  to death with this axe.
*  But rather than spending life in prison, he's eventually extradited back to Azerbaijan,
*  where the authorities have promised Hungary that he will serve his sentence.
*  But instead, as soon as he arrives back in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, he's hailed
*  as a conquering hero.
*  And the president of Azerbaijan, promotes him to a higher officer rank, gives him a
*  new apartment.
*  And this guy, a convicted murderer, becomes a national hero in Azerbaijan because he is
*  killed an Armenian.
*  So the president is clearly sending a message to his people, but also to Armenians here,
*  right?
*  That they will be dealt with, with extreme violence.
*  He's congratulating that.
*  So where does that sentiment, that ethnic nationalist tool he's wielding lead?
*  This sentiment leads to a new war, ultimately.
*  Over these years, Azerbaijan has been buying huge amounts of weapons from Israel, from
*  Turkey and other countries.
*  And at the end of this process, Azerbaijan has a formidable fighting force that Armenia
*  simply cannot match.
*  And in 2020, after the failure of yet another round of peace talks and negotiations, Azerbaijan
*  unleashes this military machine onto Nagorno-Karabakh.
*  Azerbaijan says its troops have begun entering the areas surrounding the disputed territory
*  of Nagorno-Karabakh.
*  And in the space of 44 days, they make mincemeat of Armenia's foreign-feary military and take
*  back much of the territory they lost in 1994.
*  But they don't take Nagorno-Karabakh because...
*  The Azerbaijani Republic and the Republic of Armenia stop at their positions.
*  Vladimir Putin of Russia intervenes.
*  Overseas tonight, Armenia and Azerbaijan brokered a peaceful deal that ended weeks of fighting
*  and bloodshed.
*  But for many...
*  And in an effort to assure both sides that this ceasefire will actually hold, he commits
*  to send a Russian peacekeeping force of about 2,000 soldiers to police the arrangement.
*  But the ceasefire leaves Nagorno-Karabakh a sort of isolated island surrounded on all
*  sides once again by Azerbaijan and very, very vulnerable.
*  And the Armenians are terrified.
*  And they realize it's only a matter of time before the Azerbaijanis take back the last
*  bit of what they see as their rightful territory.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Nagorno-Karabakh is surrounded.
*  And the Armenians think it's only a matter of time before this little spot of land is
*  overrun.
*  What's the beginning of the end of this conflict?
*  The first very serious clouds on the horizon came in December last year when suddenly so-called
*  youth activists from Azerbaijan start appearing on the only road connecting Armenia to the
*  ethnic enclave.
*  Youth activists, like people carrying signs?
*  Yeah, they were self-declared patriots who wanted to recover what they considered their
*  sacred land.
*  And this was clearly orchestrated by the government in Azerbaijan.
*  And in April this year, the Azerbaijani military sets up a checkpoint on the road.
*  The only way that Armenia can supply food, medicine, and weapons to Nagorno-Karabakh
*  Right, this is a very important road because it's effectively the umbilical cord from
*  Armenia to this enclave.
*  Exactly.
*  So Nagorno-Karabakh is totally isolated and the population is getting hungrier and weaker
*  and effectively just waiting for the final blow to fall.
*  And at the end of September, the Azerbaijani military launches yet another attack.
*  And within 24 hours, they have crushed the Armenian defenses on this territory.
*  The Armenian government in Nagorno-Karabakh collapses.
*  They have a president, they have a flag, they have a parliament, and it just dissolves.
*  This conflict that had been going on for more than 30 years is over in a night.
*  And in the wake of that, the population, ethnic Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh
*  begins to trickle out.
*  And it begins slowly at first, but within the following days this very thin trickle
*  turns into a flood.
*  Tens of thousands of people leaving each day.
*  The horizon is just trucks, tractors, cars, people on foot flooding down this single road
*  from Nagorno-Karabakh into Armenia proper.
*  So by the end of the lightning military campaign by Azerbaijan in September, 100,000 people
*  have left, which is almost the entire Armenian population.
*  And the Armenian government is just trying to get the people out of the country.
*  100,000 people have left, which is almost the entire population of Nagorno-Karabakh.
*  So it was an exodus.
*  My colleague Ivan Nacheporenko and the local journalist Nairey Abrahamian went to the border
*  to document this flight of Armenians.
*  One of the most poignant stories they came across was a guy who'd been recording the
*  struggle for this enclave for 30 years on his video camera.
*  And in a few minutes he decided he had to burn all his recordings from the first war
*  onwards, like 100 cassettes.
*  And he said with tears in his eyes, he set fire to this whole collection.
*  And his history and this territory's history for the last 30 plus years went up in smoke.
*  He burned his 100 cassettes.
*  I burned 100 videocassettes.
*  Why had he burned them?
*  He was worried that if he had footage of soldiers fighting, which he did, he would be accused
*  of being a spy, of being an Armenian agent, and that he would be prosecuted.
*  He said it 15 minutes took him to pack up everything, and that was the last thing he
*  did before leaving his house.
*  God.
*  It's like he's erasing his identity, his essence somehow.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's what's happening in Nagorno-Karabakh now.
*  The Armenian identity of Nagorno-Karabakh is being erased mostly through the flight of
*  its people, fleeing what they fear will be a round of revenge killings by the Azerbaijanis.
*  There's very little evidence that that actually happened.
*  But in people's heads, there was this overpowering fear of the fate that they awaited them if
*  they stuck around.
*  So whether intentional or not, it was an ethnic cleansing, more through fear than actual violence.
*  So what changed between 2020 and now?
*  I mean, as you said, Putin intervened in 2020 to save Nagorno-Karabakh for the Armenians
*  to block it from a Azeri invasion effectively.
*  What's different?
*  The big difference, of course, is that in 2020, when Putin invested a lot of time and effort into
*  brokering a ceasefire, he was not engaged in Ukraine.
*  Since February 24 last year, he has had other concerns.
*  And it's not only distracted his attention, it's distracted the attention of the Russian
*  military, which is providing the peacekeeping forces on the ground around Nagorno-Karabakh.
*  So whereas when they were first sent in 2020, they took their duties relatively seriously.
*  By the time this area attack came this year, these peacekeeping troops, the best of them
*  had been moved on to Ukraine.
*  They were left with a skeletal crew and a skeletal crew that had no interest in
*  engaging in another fight on the ground of Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh.
*  So they just stood aside.
*  That is one of the most extraordinary elements of this whole saga, that the Russian military
*  did nothing when the Azerbaijanis set up their military roadblock.
*  The Azerbaijanis unfurled a giant national flag within a few feet of the Russian soldiers
*  who just watched on.
*  They clearly had orders.
*  Don't intervene.
*  Just let them get on with it.
*  So I think Putin had sort of just checked out.
*  He had far more important things to deal with than the survival or basically extinction of
*  the ethnic Armenian state in Nagorno-Karabakh.
*  And what about the rest of the world?
*  I mean, there was a time, as we were talking about, when all of the big powers were focused
*  on this conflict, in particular the Americans.
*  Yeah, this area was the focus of what became in the journalistic cliché, the great game.
*  But by the time this latest conflict of Nagorno-Karabakh, the Americans were a much
*  diminished force, at least in terms of their ambitions.
*  I mean, the days of the 1990s when Washington hoped that the former Soviet Union would become
*  this big garden of blossoming democracy and economic prosperity, that was all gone.
*  And as soon as Nagorno-Karabakh fell, but only afterwards, the Biden administration
*  rushed out to senior administration officials to Armenia, but largely just to hold their
*  hands and offer some cold comfort.
*  At their loss, there was no promise of
*  additional aid beyond some humanitarian shipments.
*  There was certainly no move to sanction Azerbaijan for having used military force
*  to resolve a dispute that the US and the Europeans had always insisted
*  must be resolved through diplomatic means.
*  People have lost interest.
*  So in the end, what finally finished this conflict wasn't some kind of masterful diplomatic push.
*  It was really about the Armenians coming to terms with the fact that they couldn't win,
*  right? That they had lost the Russian backing.
*  The world kind of had moved on, didn't care about it anymore.
*  So, you know, wars keep going when both sides know that they can win.
*  And that wasn't the case here.
*  Yeah, the Armenian side recognized reluctantly, grudgingly, and with deep bitterness,
*  that they could not win militarily, that the Azerbaijani military was far superior.
*  And throwing Armenian troops into this fight would have been pointless and would have just
*  left Armenia even more exhausted, more diminished than it was with the loss of Nagorno-Karabakh.
*  Right. And in the end, force was what ended it.
*  Yes, exactly. After decades of elaborate diplomatic formula meetings in expensive hotels from
*  Key West to Geneva to Moscow, and extraordinary diplomatic efforts to solve this thing,
*  what ended it was pure brute force.
*  The Azerbaijanis were more powerful than the Armenians, and they won.
*  And what does this say about the role of diplomacy in these seemingly unsolvable conflicts?
*  Well, sadly, it shows diplomacy is very limited when two sides have
*  irreconcilable demands, in this case, for a piece of territory, a piece of land claimed by two people,
*  whose positions are basically unbudging. It's ours, no, it's ours.
*  And this went on for 30 years. And now this conflict is over, has been declared over,
*  has been forced to be over by military force, but clearly the issue is not solved.
*  And the danger here without a diplomatic solution is that there will be another eruption
*  on other points of dispute between these two countries. They also claim other bits of land,
*  each side, and there are rumblings at the moment that Azerbaijan could be gearing up
*  to strike into Armenia to seize another patch of territory.
*  So it's a puzzle, right? The diplomacy didn't work, but without the diplomacy,
*  the conflict continues.
*  Well, exactly. That's the underlying disputes, tensions, hatreds even between these two countries
*  have not gone away. And they could well erupt in the fairly near future into another armed
*  confrontation, which will put diplomats back to the table, which will set people drawing up new
*  plans. And you have to hope that maybe this time they'll be a bit more successful.
*  Andy, thank you.
*  You're welcome.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. Israel hit a densely populated neighborhood in northern
*  Gaza on Tuesday, and what it said was an operation to kill Hamas militants there.
*  The Israeli military said that its, quote, wide-scale airstrikes had killed a Hamas
*  commander who had helped plan the October 7th attack on Israel. They said his battalion had
*  taken over civilian buildings in the Jabalaya neighborhood. A video from the scene broadcast
*  by the Reuters news agency showed hundreds of people searching through the rubble of a collapsed
*  multi-story building. The Times reports that a doctor at a nearby hospital said that the
*  facility was receiving hundreds of injured and that dozens were dead. Meanwhile, photos satellite
*  images and videos verified by the New York Times showed formations of troops and armored vehicles
*  approaching Gaza City as Israel's military moved closer to Gaza's main population center.
