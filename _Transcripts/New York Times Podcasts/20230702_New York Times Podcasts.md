# The Sunday Read: ‘A Week With the Wild Children of the A.I. Boom’

*  My name is Yiren Liu. I'm a writer based in Greenwich, Connecticut. I've been around
*  technology basically my whole life. I grew up in Silicon Valley. My father was a software
*  engineer. And until a few years ago, I also was a software engineer at places like Uber
*  and Google. A friend of mine recently came back from San Francisco and said something
*  memorable to me. He said that it seems like everyone in SF is either starting or running
*  an artificial intelligence company or they're trying to fund one. And what did he mean
*  by artificial intelligence company? You've probably heard of Chatchy PT. It's the AI-powered
*  chatbot that's taken the world by storm. It was the fastest application ever to hit 100
*  million users, faster even than Facebook or TikTok. And the success of Chatchy PT has
*  inspired a whole segment of young entrepreneurs to build startups and applications around AI.
*  And many of those people are congregating in person in SF. They are throwing hackathons
*  every weekend. There are newsletters that tell you all about the IRL events happening
*  in SF, many of which are AI themed. And at a lot of these events, you're seeing some
*  of the same faces over and over again. But what I was intrigued by was, who are these
*  people? And are they just carpet baggers jumping on the latest type train or is there something
*  really transformative happening here? So this Sunday read is based on my recent New York
*  Times magazine article about the week I spent at a startup accelerator in San Francisco.
*  What was unique about this accelerator was that all the participants lived together for
*  the duration of the program. And this beautiful Bowsart mansion near Elimos Square. And the
*  premise of the setup was that by having their meals and housing provided for, the fellows
*  would be freed up to spend all their time and energy and focus on building a successful
*  startup. And most of these fellows were working on AI startups. One of my first days at the
*  house, I was standing outside the dining room, getting my food when I heard a man, one of
*  the fellows talking to a woman on the phone. And I assumed from the conversation in the
*  tone that he was talking to his girlfriend. But as I walked into the room, I saw that
*  actually no, he'd been talking with an AI speech model that he was working on, which could
*  assume various personas. And as we got to talking, I found out that this guy was previously
*  the founder of a medical billing startup. His story matched what I heard from a lot of
*  people during that week in San Francisco, that many of these people in the AI community
*  and SF were second time founders, experienced entrepreneurs. And they had maybe spent,
*  you know, there are 20s working on something completely different. But now they felt like
*  the time was right from both the technical perspective, from a funding perspective, to
*  be able to go back to their original passions of working in AI, their youthful dreams of
*  building an intelligence greater than ourselves. So here's my article from the New York Times
*  magazine, A Week with the Wild Children of the AI Boom, read by Emily Woozeller.
*  The Archbishop's Mansion in San Francisco built in 1904 is now a stately hotel at the
*  northeast corner of Alamo Square Park. Since February, it has been rented out entirely to HF
*  zero, or Hacker Fellowship zero, a startup accelerator that provides 12 week residencies
*  for batches of fellows from 10 different startups. Their experience, which culminates in a
*  demonstration day, is supposed to be the most productive three months of the fellow's lives.
*  Dave Fontano, one of HF zero's founders, was inspired by the two years he spent living in
*  monasteries in his 20s. While monastery life was materially aesthetic, he found that it was
*  luxurious in the freedom it gave residents to focus on the things that really mattered. And at
*  the Archbishop's Mansion this year, almost everyone has been monastically focused on what has
*  become San Francisco's newest religion, artificial intelligence. The AI Gospel had not yet spread in
*  2021, when Fontano and his two co-founders, Emily Liu and Evan Stight's Clayton started the accelerator.
*  Even a year ago, when HF zero hosted a batch of fellows at a hotel in Miami, six out of the
*  eight companies represented were cryptocurrency startups. But at the mansion in San Francisco, eight
*  of the 10 companies in HF zero's first batch this year were working on AI-based apps. And the
*  lone crypto startup, focused on what happens to your Bitcoin when you die, was worried, they told me,
*  about whether the investors who showed up at this spring's demo day would actually want to invest in them.
*  That generative AI has largely supplanted crypto in the eyes of founders and venture capitalists
*  alike is not exactly surprising. When open AI released ChatGPT late last year, it sparked
*  in new craze, at a time when the collapsing crypto and tech markets had left many investors and
*  would be entrepreneurs adrift. Unsure of where to put their capital in time. Suddenly users
*  everywhere were realizing that AI could now respond to verbal queries with a startling degree
*  of human-like fluency. Large language models have been around for a long time, but their uses were
*  limited. Says Robert Nishihara, a co-founder of any scale, a startup for machine learning infrastructure.
*  But there's a threshold where they become dramatically more useful. And I think now it's crossed that.
*  One appeal of generative AI is that it offers something for every would be entrepreneur.
*  For the technically minded, there is research to be done. For the business types, it's easy to
*  create applications on top of the open AI platforms. For the philosophically inclined, AI offers
*  interesting avenues through which to explore what it means to be conscious and human. And unlike crypto,
*  especially now, AI is a more credible field to be in for mainstream techies.
*  Its products have already achieved significant traction among consumers.
*  Chat GPT is believed to be the fastest app ever to hit 100 million users. And some of the figures
*  at its forefront are familiar faces, now in their second acts. Like Sam Altman, formerly the president
*  of the startup accelerator Y Combinator, and Greg Brockman, formerly the chief technology officer at
*  Stripe, the payments processing company. In short, you can't help thinking that, as one friend
*  recently proclaimed to me, everyone in SF is either starting or running an AI company or starting
*  or running an AI fund. AI, in turn, seems to love San Francisco back. During the pandemic,
*  as tech workers went remote and Twitter pundits evangelized the tax benefits of being in Austin or
*  Miami, the San Francisco area seemed poised to seed its startup primacy. But recently that trend
*  has reversed. There's a sense that if you want to be working in AI, this is still the place to be.
*  We actually first considered doing the batch in New York. But when I went to New York and asked
*  people what they thought of GitHub co-pilot, an AI-powered coding assistant, people told me they
*  maybe tried it once. Fontanaux said, on the other hand, people in SF told me they were using it to
*  write 50% of their code. Fontanaux anecdote gets at one of Silicon Valley's enduring qualities.
*  The willingness, even eagerness, to embrace new technology. Out in the rest of the world,
*  AI is triggering nerves, fears, and even predictions of wiped out jobs, of existential doom,
*  and endless commentary. In San Francisco, it has kindled all these things too, but also a question
*  just as powerful. How do you get a piece of it? During the day, the Archbishop's mansion often
*  feels surprisingly empty and quiet. Perhaps because it's so large. There are four floors and a grand
*  staircase that winds up through the middle of the building, lit by a giant skylight.
*  Many of the teams work in their rooms upstairs. Some teams work in the HAC space in the basement,
*  with its white boards and rows of standing desks. When I was visiting the spring,
*  one wall displayed some chat GPT-generated poetry. In HF-0, the hackers work and play,
*  with laughter and fun throughout the day. There are community of techies with a heart of gold,
*  and their humor and hacking skills never grow old.
*  But on a spring Friday night, the one night of the week when the broader tech community is
*  welcomed in, the AI party was in full swing. Fontino and Lou bounded around the common spaces at
*  the front of the mansion, giving out effusive hellos and introductions. In one back room, a bar
*  served elixirs. The mansion is a no-alcohol zone. In another, an AI rap battle raged. It wasn't much
*  of a battle, actually. While the AI is no M&M, it was still destroying everyone.
*  In a third, Jonathan Shobruk, a fellow, was demoing his product, a adrenaline,
*  a tool that lets you ask natural language questions of your code base. He had the interface
*  up on a monitor and a small cluster of spectators around him, seemingly riveted.
*  Can you ask it to implement Rellue? Sasha Shang asked. Shang, a former software engineer at
*  Facebook, is now working on her own app. In dyed pig tails into baseball cap, she is something
*  of a personality in the community. Oh yeah, that's a hard question. Shobruk responded. On his keyboard,
*  he typed, which neural networks use Rellue? The right answer flashed on the screen. The cursor
*  blinking as characters appeared. Someone asked how it worked. I just basically chunked up all the
*  files into functions and classes in groups of code, generated summaries of those code chunks,
*  and then recursively summarized the file. Shobruk said,
*  do you use an abstract syntax tree? Only in San Francisco would people be talking about abstract
*  syntax trees at 9 p.m. on a Friday night. Out in the main entryway, someone introduced himself
*  as Bruno. I asked him whether he was in AI. My first two companies were in AI, but now I'm in crypto,
*  he said jovially. Fontanille came up from behind and slung an arm over his shoulders.
*  I'm not popular anymore. No one wants to talk to me. Bruno fake moaned. But he didn't seem
*  deeply bothered by cryptos abrupt come down in AI's ascendance. Bruno, it turned out,
*  was Bruno Faviaro, a well-known investor and entrepreneur. He and Fontanille have been buddies
*  since they met as college students when each of them was organizing hackathons.
*  After Fontanille left school in 2013, he dropped out of the University of Michigan, where he was
*  studying computer science. He continued to run hackathons and networked in the tech world as
*  Faviaro built his first company. Four years ago, he called me to say that he was raising a fund.
*  Faviaro told me. I was like, yeah, whatever everyone is raising a fund. A week later,
*  he calls me and is like, hey, the fund is oversubscribed. Do you still want to put in a check?
*  If Dave says he's going to do something, he does it. Or as Emily Liu put it to me,
*  you show up to one of Dave's things as a friend and 10 minutes later you're wearing a staff shirt.
*  Fontanille is charismatic, a forceful speaker with wild hair. Like all good venture capitalists,
*  he is a general partner in the investment firm back end capital. He has an unaring
*  nose for the thing of the moment. Be it blockchain or AI. That he seems agnostic about whether it's
*  blockchain or AI or some other underlying technology is almost beside the point.
*  In many ways, he personifies the modern Silicon Valley dichotomy between spirituality and hustle,
*  between monasticism and flamboyance. His expertise, he believes, is people.
*  We look for three things. Grit, storytelling ability and product sense, he said,
*  describing the selection process for the fellows. Notably absent from this list, I pointed out,
*  was a background in machine learning. Fontanille shrugged. This generation of startups doesn't
*  have to come up with its own cutting edge research. Big companies like OpenAI and Google will provide that.
*  Instead, he said, the fellows need the ability to build prototypes quickly on top of the new models.
*  And in fact, the unifying threat among the first batch of 2023 fellows was their experience at
*  that sort of enterprise. The average age was 28. Fontanille was 30. And several of them were
*  second time founders. Adam Reese is a founder of Candid Health, which provides medical billing software.
*  Emma Salinas founded an online community called Genzy Mafia. While various fellows often talk about
*  how they've long been interested in AI, it's clear that some of the why now is opportunistic.
*  But if the people at hackathons and programs like HF0 tend to be newcomers to AI,
*  this doesn't preclude their success. The consensus is that building things in the AI field isn't
*  as complex as working in biology, say, you don't need to get a separate PhD in it.
*  If you're already good at math and good at engineering and good at business,
*  there are few limits to what you can do.
*  A few themes characterize the sorts of projects the HF0 fellows have been working on.
*  On the one hand, there are applications to automate tedious business tasks,
*  like copywriting or a spreadsheet wrangling. A company called FileRead falls into this category.
*  Its law firm customers upload all the documents relevant to a particular case into an online portal.
*  FileRead indexes those documents into a special database that enables users to search the
*  documents not only for exact terms like truck or James, but also for broader questions,
*  like who made the transaction or what are the relevant cases.
*  Under the hood, FileRead first fetches the most relevant documents from its database.
*  Then adds those documents to a user's question and sends the whole long query to the open AI
*  application programming interface or API. FileRead then spits out an answer,
*  powered by the same large language models behind chat GPT.
*  Without AI, identifying and crafting a legal narrative by piecing together textual evidence
*  from thousands of sources is a painstakingly manual process. Most of FileReads customers specialize
*  in business litigation, including antitrust and liability cases. Sometimes they are paid on contingency,
*  which means when they succeed, they typically get a percentage of the award or settlement,
*  but when they lose, they get nothing. Firms need the AI to efficiently search for evidence in the
*  documents that might, for example, either establish or refute liability. They don't have the manpower
*  or the budget to do unlimited document review. Says Chan Koh, a FileRead founder and an HF0 fellow.
*  They want to spend the minimal amount of effort in order to win the case.
*  Other HF0 fellows have been creating applications that lean into AI's seemingly human affect
*  in order to tackle some psychological need. For instance, Brian Basham, who has worked in Google's
*  Brain Division, and since 2018 has been a life coach in California, is working on thyself.
*  A subscription service for a guided emotional inquiry that currently uses AI and human coaches,
*  but will eventually transition fully to AI. I met him and his employee Maverick Cune over
*  dinner one night at the Archbishop's Mansion. After Cune waxed Rhapsodyk about a four-week long
*  retreat he attended last summer, called Sleep Awake. I asked him whether the experience would have
*  been as great if the facilitators had said and done all the same things, but been AI's.
*  Probably not, he conceded. That would very much be a disembodied head.
*  One-on-one life coaching from the current human AI hybrid version of thyself costs $50 an hour.
*  Once the service is fully automated, Basham expects to be able to offer unlimited sessions for $30
*  a month. At that price, he believes it would be broadly accessible. A few days later, I did my first
*  thyself session. Mostly it consisted of the bot asking me to visualize scenarios, remembered or
*  imagined scenes, and then to describe the physical sensations and emotions that resulted from
*  surfing the emotional wave. I didn't feel much of an emotional wave, but I was impressed by how
*  natural it felt to speak to an AI-filtered guide. Compared with calling, say, the automated hotline
*  for a cell service provider, it was a vast improvement. Although it did tend to talk over me.
*  Evan's Knights Clayton, an HF-0 founder, and a fellow in the Accelerators' inaugural batch,
*  has come up with a similarly intimate product, an AI assistant called Consort.
*  To try it out, I had to go through a 15-minute quasi-thera-be session, where I was asked about my
*  childhood, my relationship to my parents, and my favorite books. A few hours after my responses were
*  fed into the AI, Stite's Clayton, who was a founder of T-Spring, now Spring, a platform that sells
*  custom-made t-shirts and other merchandise, sent me a link to my consort, which I could then text.
*  Over the course of the next couple of days, it texted me a daily message at midnight, reminding me
*  to wind down for the night. On the weekends, it asked me whether I was planning to go out.
*  The texts included appropriately casual spelling and lack of punctuation. I found myself warming to it,
*  despite an earlier prejudice against becoming friends with AI.
*  AI and emotional regulation might seem like an odd juxtaposition, but it makes sense that
*  emotional labor, at the end of the day, just another form of labor, could be one of the first
*  job categories to be transformed by automation. And yet, setting aside its effectiveness,
*  there's something odd about using AI to manage our human brains when it's not clear that the
*  AI brain is at all similar to ours. We're obviously trying to anthropomorphize AI,
*  make it in our image. Said Matthew Rastovak, the founder of Respell, a tool that lets you create
*  AI apps without doing any coding. Because we don't really know how else to build and understand
*  a new kind of intelligence. But I think it's much more likely that it's going to be like a reptile,
*  and that it has its instincts, but we can't understand what's going on inside its brain and
*  listen to its actual thoughts. We were sitting on the roof of atmosphere, a hacker house in
*  knob hill that he helped found. All around us, San Francisco was enchanting in the afternoon light.
*  Earlier, he paraphrased for me some lines that he liked from season two of Westworld
*  that spoke to how early we still are, and how blinkered when it comes to understanding this technology.
*  Sanity is a very narrow sliver of the possibilities of mind. Because we have culturally accepted
*  norms, we have a certain way of acting and thinking and speaking, and if you deviate from that a
*  little too much, then you're at best weird and at worst, clinically insane.
*  In the end, San Francisco was a very close friend of the world.
*  Sanity is a very close friend of the world.
*  Sanity is a very close friend of the world.
*  Sanity is a very close friend of the world.
*  During the week I spent staying at HF-0. Everyone told me I had to make it down to the south bay
*  for the AGI House GPT-4 hackathon. The organizers asked me to come after 6 p.m. though,
*  so as to not distract the hackers before it started.
*  AGI stands for Artificial General Intelligence, a phrase that has come to represent a potential
*  dream goal for AI. A machine intelligence with the flexibility to handle any intellectual
*  task that humans can. AGI House, it turns out, is a $68 million dollar mansion in the small town
*  of Hillsboro, 25 minutes from downtown Palo Alto. The mansion has a long thoroughfare of
*  ferns out front, a pool and a barbecue pit in the back. Rocky U, previously the chief executive
*  of an augmented reality startup, runs AGI House, overseeing both its 10 residents and a raft of
*  community events. He is warm and smiley and exceedingly well connected in the local AI community.
*  The crowd at that night's GPT-4 hackathon was so large as to render the Wi-Fi basically non-functional.
*  Every room overflowed with hackers crowding around white boards. In the kitchen,
*  Chinese takeout was laid out on a table. A smattering of investors were present to check out
*  the demos, which started at 8 p.m. with short speeches from the organizers. The speeches were
*  all variations on a theme. We are living in a momentous time. Maybe in a few decades from now,
*  we'll look back at all these seminal AI achievements and see that they all came from this house in Hillsboro.
*  As at HF-0, the demos here alternated between business uses and personal applications.
*  A chatbot that impersonates business gurus like Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas-Mavrix
*  Basketball team and a judge on Shark Tank, the business reality TV show, and that allows you to
*  ask for business advice, or an AI sommelier that will take your dinner menu and suggest an appropriate
*  wine pairing. Six months ago, any one of these projects might have seemed remarkable,
*  but the arrival of chat GPT has remade expectations. The one pattern I'm starting to see is that
*  chat GPT is the killer app. The technologist Diego Bosch has written on Twitter. None of the tools
*  built on top of the API have been as useful to me. Indeed, if you are building something on top
*  of OpenAI's API, it does seem as though your app's marginal value has to be extremely high. If it is
*  to avoid being bulldozed by either OpenAI itself or one of the big tech companies like Google and
*  Microsoft, or even later stage startups that are rapidly rolling out AI-enabled features in their
*  products. As two analysts at NEA, an investment firm put it in a recent report,
*  generative AI may not be as disruptive to established businesses and beneficial to startups as
*  previous big shifts in tech platforms. Unlike with the prior shifts, incumbents do not need to
*  re-architect their entire products to adopt this new platform shift. The analysts wrote,
*  in addition, this shift favors companies with bigger proprietary data sets, which can give an
*  edge to more established companies. During previous tech eras, startups could introduce a superior
*  technology or interface and then race to build market share before entrenched competitors could
*  match them. But with large language models, incumbents like Google and Microsoft have had a huge
*  head start in both developing the technology and acquiring market share among consumers.
*  The situation risks becoming like that of the pharmaceutical industry, in which research and
*  development is outsourced to startups and many of the benefits ultimately accrue to the parent company.
*  Moreover, the capital-intensive nature of training large language models means that smaller
*  companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, creating their own large language models, have few alternatives
*  beyond making Faustian partnerships with tech giants. This doesn't mean that generative AI isn't going
*  to transform industries or eliminate jobs. Beyond the incumbents, one beneficiary might well be the
*  Indy hacker, the kind of coder for hire who does niche AI projects to fill specific needs in
*  specific industries. Problems that have been too esoteric to solve or workflows that have been
*  too complicated to improve might become easily automated with the help of chat GPT,
*  as the Gumroad founder saw Hill Levin Gia recently put it on a podcast.
*  If I had a friend who's like, I want to make 200K a year, building something in SAS,
*  software as a service, building some AI tool, I would basically tell them to walk around their
*  neighborhood, go to as many businesses as possible and see what manual thing, what piece of paper
*  you sign, and figure out how to automate that. That the era of VC backed outsize returns might
*  be coming to an end is of course a source of anxiety. Everyone in Silicon Valley knows someone who
*  worked at the last generation of successful startups, startups whose growth followed the proverbial
*  hockey stick line on a graph and reaped the benefits. Who doesn't want to get their share,
*  whether money, status, fame, before it all runs out? This anxiety is compounded by the fact that
*  it feels as if the deterioration of the physical world is happening roughly at a pace with the
*  flourishing of the virtual one. And the only way to insulate yourself is by achieving vast
*  financial success. In some ways, San Francisco perfectly embodies this tension. AI is moving toward
*  AGI, but outside the high-end tech offices, there is rampant homelessness. House prices are so high
*  that even couples with two tech incomes can't afford to buy property, and children are sufficiently
*  rare as to make them a spectacle. But the anxiety runs deeper than concerns about success, prestige,
*  or even material safety. Change has always been accompanied by hand-ringing, and the pace of change
*  in AI right now is mind-bending. The resulting mood is perhaps best encapsulated by tweets from
*  Tiago Forte, the productivity guru known for a self-help system called second brain.
*  I'm feeling a broad loss of motivation for many projects and goals that used to excite me
*  due to what I'm seeing with AI. Forte posted in April. It's not fear of AI apocalypse,
*  or fear that I'll lose my job or anything like that. More like a feeling of grief,
*  that many of the personal skills and qualities I've spent a lot of time developing have suddenly
*  been devalued. This, of course, is not a new kind of on-way. It has always been a bewildering
*  experience to lose your livelihood because of technological change. Silicon Valley has just
*  generally been on the right side of it. For the first time, such change heralds in era in which
*  software engineers themselves may be less well compensated, and less in demand. After years of
*  disrupting other industries, Silicon Valley has disrupted itself. Back at the Archbishop's mansion,
*  52 general partners from the Valley's top venture capital funds were in attendance,
*  as the years first batch of HF zero fellows made their presentations at Demo Day on April 4.
*  A few days later, Fontano posted a behind-the-scenes video of the event. It started with drone footage
*  zooming in on the mansion, then cut to a close-up of Adam Rays, a fellow jittery with nerves before
*  his presentation. Y'all this room is f***ed, Fontano said in the video. Sequoia's here, Benchmarks
*  here. A16z is here. Everyone's here. So anyone you would want to meet, they're here, and they're
*  excited. He was wearing a pink woolly winter hat with a pom-pom, inexplicably, and he sounded like
*  Caesar rallying the troops. Two weeks after Demo Day, all ten teams had received initial offers
*  from outside investors, and some had chosen lead investors. Fontano was optimistic. HF zero's
*  next batch, to be hosted again at the mansion, was set to begin in May, and as he was reviewing
*  applications, he texted me, the talent coming in now is insane. A few days later, I saw on Twitter
*  that a friend of mine, Travis Fisher, would be joining the next HF zero batch. He and I last hung
*  out in real life two years ago. At the time, the hot thing was the creator economy, and he was looking
*  to develop tools that would enable people, particularly open-source software developers, to monetize
*  their work. While that effort in the end wasn't fruitful, last year he started a series of side
*  projects in AI. These included coming up with a way for other developers to use the chat GPT API
*  so they can more easily incorporate large language models into their products. Travis no longer talks
*  as much about the creator economy. At HF zero, he is now working on an open-source framework for
*  building reliable AI agents that do things such as booking airplane tickets or submitting tax
*  documents. But despite the shifts in theme, my sense is that what he's passionate about,
*  making tools for the open-source community hasn't changed. He has just found a way to come at it
*  from a different angle, and in that adaptability, that ability to reinvent himself while coming out
*  on top. He resembles Silicon Valley itself.
