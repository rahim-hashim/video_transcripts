# The Sunday Read: ‘A Week With the Wild Children of the A.I. Boom’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzI-TREYqck)
*  My name is Yi Ran Liu. I'm a writer based in Greenwich, Connecticut. I've been around
*  technology basically my whole life. I grew up in Silicon Valley. My father was a software
*  engineer. And until a few years ago, I also was a software engineer at places like Uber
*  and Google. A friend of mine recently came back from San Francisco and said something
*  memorable to me. He said that it seems like everyone in SF is either starting or running
*  an artificial intelligence company or they're trying to fund one. And what did he mean by
*  artificial intelligence company? You've probably heard of ChatGPT. It's the AI powered chatbot
*  that's taken the world by storm. It was the fastest application ever to hit 100 million
*  users faster even than Facebook or TikTok. And the success of ChatGPT has inspired a
*  whole segment of young entrepreneurs to build startups and applications around AI. And
*  many of those people are congregating in person in SF. They are throwing hackathons every
*  weekend. There are newsletters that tell you all about the IRL events happening in SF,
*  many of which are AI themed. And at a lot of these events, you're seeing some of the
*  same faces over and over again. But what I was intrigued by was who are these people
*  and are they just carpet baggers jumping on the latest hype train or is there something
*  really transformative happening here? So this Sunday read is based on my recent New York
*  Times Magazine article about the week I spent at a startup accelerator in San Francisco.
*  What was unique about this accelerator was that all the participants lived together for
*  the duration of the program in this beautiful Beaux-Arts mansion near Alamo Square. And
*  the premise of the setup was that by having their meals and housing provided for, the
*  fellows would be freed up to spend all their time and energy and focus on building a successful
*  startup. And most of these fellows were working on AI startups.
*  One of my first days at the house, I was standing outside the dining room getting my food when
*  I heard a man, one of the fellows talking to a woman on the phone. And I assumed from
*  the conversation and the tone that he was talking to his girlfriend. But as I walked
*  into the room, I saw that actually no, he'd been talking with an AI speech model that
*  he was working on, which could assume various personas. And as we got to talking, I found
*  out that this guy was previously the founder of a medical billing startup. His story matched
*  what I heard from a lot of people during that week in San Francisco, that many of these
*  people in the AI community in SF were second time founders, experienced entrepreneurs,
*  and they maybe spent their 20s working on something completely different. But now they felt like
*  the time was right from both a technical perspective, from a funding perspective, to be able to
*  go back to their original passions of working in AI, their youthful dreams of building an
*  intelligence greater than ourselves. So here's my article from the New York Times magazine,
*  A Week with the Wild Children of the AI Boom, read by Emily Wu-Zeller.
*  The Archbishop's Mansion in San Francisco, built in 1904, is now a stately hotel at the
*  northeast corner of Alamo Square Park. Since February, it has been rented out entirely
*  to HF Zero, or Hacker Fellowship Zero, a startup accelerator that provides 12-week residencies
*  for batches of fellows from 10 different startups. Their experience, which culminates
*  in a demonstration day, is supposed to be the most productive three months of the fellows'
*  lives.
*  Dave Fontenot, one of HF Zero's founders, was inspired by the two years he spent living
*  in monasteries in his 20s. While monastery life was materially ascetic, he found that
*  it was luxurious in the freedom it gave residents to focus on the things that really mattered.
*  And at the Archbishop's Mansion this year, almost everyone has been monastically focused
*  on what has become San Francisco's newest religion, artificial intelligence.
*  The AI gospel had not yet spread in 2021, when Fontenot and his two co-founders, Emily
*  Liu and Evan Stites Clayton, started the accelerator. Even a year ago, when HF Zero hosted a batch
*  of fellows at a hotel in Miami, six out of the eight companies represented were cryptocurrency
*  startups. But at the mansion in San Francisco, eight of the ten companies in HF Zero's
*  first batch this year were working on AI-based apps. And the lone crypto startup, focused
*  on what happens to your bitcoin when you die, was worried, they told me, about whether the
*  investors who showed up at this spring's demo day would actually want to invest in them.
*  That generative AI has largely supplanted crypto in the eyes of founders and venture capitalists
*  alike is not exactly surprising. When OpenAI released ChatGPT late last year, it sparked
*  a new craze at a time when the collapsing crypto and tech markets had left many investors
*  and would-be entrepreneurs adrift, unsure of where to put their capital and time. Suddenly,
*  users everywhere were realizing that AI could now respond to verbal queries with a startling
*  degree of human-like fluency. Large language models have been around for a long time, but
*  their uses were limited, says Robert Nishihara, a co-founder of AnyScale, a startup for machine
*  learning infrastructure. But there's a threshold where they become dramatically more useful.
*  And I think now it's crossed that. One appeal of generative AI is that it offers something
*  for every would-be entrepreneur. For the technically minded, there is research to be done. For
*  the business types, it's easy to create applications on top of the OpenAI platforms. For the philosophically
*  inclined, AI offers interesting avenues through which to explore what it means to be conscious
*  and human. And unlike crypto, especially now, AI is a more credible field to be in for mainstream
*  techies. Its products have already achieved significant traction among consumers. ChatGPT
*  is believed to be the fastest app ever to hit 100 million users, and some of the figures
*  at its forefront are familiar faces, now in their second acts, like Sam Altman, formerly
*  the president of the startup accelerator Y Combinator, and Greg Brockman, formerly the
*  chief technology officer at Stripe, the payments processing company. In short, you can't help
*  thinking that, as one friend recently proclaimed to me, everyone in SF is either starting or
*  running an AI company or starting or running an AI fund. AI, in turn, seems to love San
*  Francisco back. During the pandemic, as tech workers went remote and Twitter pundits evangelized
*  the tax benefits of being in Austin or Miami, the San Francisco area seemed poised to cede
*  its startup primacy. But recently, that trend has reversed. There's a sense that if you
*  want to be working in AI, this is still the place to be. We actually first considered
*  doing the batch in New York. But when I went to New York and asked people what they thought
*  of GitHub Co-Pilot, an AI-powered coding assistant, people told me they maybe tried it once, Fontano
*  said. On the other hand, people in SF told me they were using it to write 50% of their code.
*  Fontano's anecdote gets at one of Silicon Valley's enduring qualities. The willingness,
*  even eagerness, to embrace new technology. Out in the rest of the world, AI is triggering nerves,
*  fears, and even predictions of wiped-out jobs, of existential doom, and endless commentary. In San
*  Francisco, it has kindled all these things too, but also a question just as powerful. How do you
*  get a piece of it? During the day, the Archbishop's Mansion often feels surprisingly empty and quiet,
*  perhaps because it's so large. There are four floors and a grand staircase that winds up through
*  the middle of the building, lit by a giant skylight. Many of the teams work in their rooms upstairs.
*  Some teams work in the hack space in the basement, with its whiteboards and rows of standing desks.
*  When I was visiting this spring, one wall displayed some chat-GPT-generated poetry.
*  In HF0, the hackers work and play, with laughter and fun throughout the day. They're a community
*  of techies with a heart of gold, and their humor and hacking skills never grow old.
*  But on a spring Friday night, the one night of the week when the broader tech community
*  is welcomed in, the AI party was in full swing. Fontenot and Lou bounded around the common spaces
*  at the front of the mansion, giving out effusive hellos and introductions. In one back room,
*  a bar served elixirs. The mansion is a no-alcohol zone. In another, an AI rap battle raged,
*  it wasn't much of a battle actually. While the AI is no M&M, it was still destroying everyone.
*  In a third, Jonathan Shobrook, a fellow, was demoing his product, Adrenaline, a tool that lets you ask
*  natural language questions of your code base. He had the interface up on a monitor and a small
*  cluster of spectators around him, seemingly riveted. Can you ask it to implement Relyeu?
*  Sasha Shang asked. Shang, a former software engineer at Facebook, is now working on her
*  own app. In dyed pigtails and a baseball cap, she is something of a personality in the community.
*  Oh yeah, that's a hard question, Shobrook responded. On his keyboard, he typed,
*  Which neural networks use Relyeu? The right answer flashed on the screen,
*  the cursor blinking as characters appeared. Someone asked how it worked.
*  I just basically chunked up all the files into functions and classes and groups of code,
*  generated summaries of those code chunks, and then recursively summarized the file,
*  Shobrook said. Do you use an abstract syntax tree? Only in San Francisco would people be talking
*  about abstract syntax trees at 9 p.m. on a Friday night. Out in the main entryway,
*  someone introduced himself as Bruno. I asked him whether he was in AI.
*  My first two companies were in AI, but now I'm in crypto, he said jovially.
*  Fontenot came up from behind and slung an arm over his shoulders.
*  I'm not popular anymore. No one wants to talk to me, Bruno fake moaned.
*  But he didn't seem deeply bothered by crypto's abrupt come down and AI's ascendance.
*  Bruno, it turned out, was Bruno Faviero, a well-known investor and entrepreneur.
*  He and Fontenot have been buddies since they met as college students,
*  when each of them was organizing hackathons. After Fontenot left school in 2013,
*  he dropped out of the University of Michigan, where he was studying computer science.
*  He continued to run hackathons and networked in the tech world as Faviero built his first company.
*  Four years ago, he called me to say that he was raising a fund, Faviero told me.
*  I was like, yeah, whatever, everyone is raising a fund.
*  A week later, he calls me and is like, hey, the fund is oversubscribed,
*  do you still want to put in a check? If Dave says he's going to do something,
*  he does it. Or as Emily Liu put it to me,
*  you show up to one of Dave's things as a friend, and ten minutes later,
*  you're wearing a staff shirt. Fontenot is charismatic,
*  a forceful speaker with wild hair. Like all good venture capitalists,
*  he is a general partner in the investment firm Backend Capital.
*  He has an unerring nose for the thing of the moment, be it blockchain or AI.
*  That he seems agnostic about whether it's blockchain or AI,
*  or some other underlying technology, is almost beside the point.
*  In many ways, he personifies the modern Silicon Valley dichotomy between
*  spirituality and hustle, between monasticism and flamboyance.
*  His expertise, he believes, is people. We look for three things, grit,
*  storytelling ability, and product sense, he said, describing the selection process for the fellows.
*  Notably absent from this list, I pointed out, was a background in machine learning.
*  Fontenot shrugged. This generation of startups doesn't have to come up with its own cutting
*  edge research. Big companies like OpenAI and Google will provide that. Instead, he said,
*  the fellows need the ability to build prototypes quickly on top of the new models.
*  And in fact, the unifying thread among the first batch of 2023 fellows was their experience at
*  that sort of enterprise. The average age was 28, Fontenot was 30, and several of them were
*  second-time founders. Adam Reese is a founder of Candid Health, which provides medical billing
*  software. Emma Salinas founded an online community called Gen Z Mafia. While various fellows often
*  talk about how they've long been interested in AI, it's clear that some of the why now is
*  opportunistic. But if the people at hackathons and programs like HF0 tend to be newcomers to AI,
*  this doesn't preclude their success. The consensus is that building things in the AI field isn't as
*  complex as working in biology, say. You don't need to get a separate PhD in it. If you're already
*  good at math and good at engineering and good at business, there are few limits to what you can do.
*  A few themes characterize the sorts of projects the HF0 fellows have been working on. On the one
*  hand, there are applications to automate tedious business tasks like copywriting or spreadsheet
*  wrangling. A company called File Read falls into this category. Its law firm customers upload all
*  the documents relevant to a particular case into an online portal. File Read indexes those documents
*  into a special database that enables users to search the documents not only for exact terms,
*  like truck or James, but also for broader questions, like who made the transaction or what
*  are the relevant cases. Under the hood, File Read first fetches the most relevant documents
*  from its database, then adds those documents to a user's question and sends the whole long
*  query to the OpenAI Application Programming Interface, or API. File Read then spits out an
*  answer, powered by the same large language models behind ChatGPT. Without AI, identifying and
*  crafting a legal narrative by piecing together textual evidence from thousands of sources is a
*  painstakingly manual process. Most of File Read's customers specialize in business litigation,
*  including antitrust and liability cases. Sometimes they are paid on contingency,
*  which means when they succeed, they typically get a percentage of the award or settlement,
*  but when they lose, they get nothing. Firms need the AI to efficiently search for evidence in the
*  documents that might, for example, either establish or refute liability. They don't have the manpower
*  or the budget to do unlimited document review, says Chan Koh, a File Read founder and an HF0 fellow.
*  They want to spend the minimal amount of effort in order to win the case. Other HF0 fellows have
*  been creating applications that lean into AI's seemingly human affect in order to tackle some
*  psychological need. For instance, Brian Basham, who has worked in Google's Brain Division and
*  since 2018 has been a life coach in California, is working on Thyself, a subscription service
*  for guided emotional inquiry that currently uses AI and human coaches but will eventually transition
*  fully to AI. I met him and his employee Maverick Kuhn over dinner one night at the Archbishop's
*  Mansion after Kuhn waxed rhapsodic about a four-week long retreat he attended last summer,
*  called Sleep Awake. I asked him whether the experience would have been as great if the
*  facilitators had said and done all the same things but been AI's. Probably not, he conceded. That
*  would very much be a disembodied head. One-on-one life coaching from the current human-AI hybrid
*  version of Thyself costs $50 an hour. Once the service is fully automated, Basham expects to be
*  able to offer unlimited sessions for $30 a month. At that price, he believes, it would be broadly
*  accessible. A few days later, I did my first Thyself session. Mostly it consisted of the
*  bot asking me to visualize scenarios, remembered or imagined scenes, and then to describe the
*  physical sensations and emotions that resulted from surfing the emotional wave. I didn't feel
*  much of an emotional wave, but I was impressed by how natural it felt to speak to an AI-filtered
*  guide. Compared with calling, say, the automated hotline for a cell service provider, it was a
*  vast improvement, although it did tend to talk over me. Evan Steitz Clayton, an HF0 founder and
*  fellow in the Accelerator's inaugural batch, has come up with a similarly intimate product,
*  an AI assistant called Consort. To try it out, I had to go through a 15-minute quasi-therapy
*  session where I was asked about my childhood, my relationship to my parents, and my favorite
*  books. A few hours after my responses were fed into the AI, Steitz Clayton, who was a founder of
*  Teespring, now Spring, a platform that sells custom-made t-shirts and other merchandise,
*  sent me a link to my Consort, which I could then text. Over the course of the next couple of days,
*  it texted me a daily message at midnight, reminding me to wind down for the night. On the
*  weekends, it asked me whether I was planning to go out. The texts included appropriately
*  casual spelling and lack of punctuation. I found myself warming to it, despite an earlier
*  prejudice against becoming friends with AI. AI and emotional regulation might seem like an odd
*  juxtaposition, but it makes sense that emotional labor, at the end of the day just another form
*  of labor, could be one of the first job categories to be transformed by automation. And yet, setting
*  its effectiveness aside, there's something odd about using AI to manage our human brains,
*  when it's not clear that the AI brain is at all similar to ours. We're obviously trying to
*  anthropomorphize AI, make it in our image, said Matthew Rastovac, the founder of Respell, a tool
*  that lets you create AI apps without doing any coding. Because we don't really know how else to
*  build and understand a new kind of intelligence. But I think it's much more likely that it's going
*  to be like a reptile, and that it has its instincts. But we can't understand what's going on inside
*  its brain and listen to its actual thoughts. We were sitting on the roof of Atmosphere,
*  a hacker house in Nob Hill that he helped found. All around us, San Francisco was enchanting in the
*  afternoon light. Earlier, he paraphrased for me some lines that he liked from season two of West
*  World that spoke to how early we still are, and how blinkered when it comes to understanding
*  this technology. Sanity is a very narrow sliver of the possibilities of mind. Because we have
*  culturally accepted norms, we have a certain way of acting and thinking and speaking. And if you
*  deviate from that a little too much, then you're at best weird, and at worst, clinically insane.
*  During the week I spent staying at HF0, everyone told me I had to make it down to the South Bay
*  for the AGI House GPT-4 Hackathon. The organizers asked me to come after 6 PM, though,
*  so as to not distract the hackers before it started.
*  AGI stands for Artificial General Intelligence, a phrase that has come to represent a potential
*  dream goal for AI. A machine intelligence with the flexibility to handle any intellectual task
*  that humans can. AGI House, it turns out, is a $68 million mansion in the small town of Hillsboro,
*  25 minutes from downtown Palo Alto. The mansion has a long thoroughfare of ferns out front,
*  a pool and a barbecue pit in the back. Rocky Yu, previously the chief executive of an augmented
*  reality startup, runs AGI House, overseeing both its 10 residents and a raft of community events.
*  He is warm and smiley, and exceedingly well connected in the local AI community.
*  The crowd at that night's GPT-4 Hackathon was so large as to render the Wi-Fi basically
*  non-functional, every room overflowed with hackers crowding around white boards.
*  In the kitchen, Chinese takeout was laid out on a table.
*  A smattering of investors were present to check out the demos, which started at 8 PM with short
*  speeches from the organizers. The speeches were all variations on a theme. We are living in a
*  momentous time. Maybe in a few decades from now, we'll look back at all these seminal AI achievements
*  and see that they all came from this house in Hillsboro.
*  As at HF0, the demos here alternated between business uses and personal applications.
*  A chatbot that impersonates business gurus like Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks
*  basketball team and a judge on Shark Tank, the business reality TV show, and that allows you
*  to ask for business advice. Or an AI sommelier that will take your dinner menu and suggest
*  an appropriate wine pairing. Six months ago, any one of these projects might have seemed
*  remarkable. But the arrival of ChatGPT has remade expectations. The one pattern I'm starting to see
*  is that ChatGPT is the killer app. The technologist Diego Bosch has written on Twitter,
*  none of the tools built on top of the API have been as useful to me. Indeed, if you are building
*  something on top of OpenAI's API, it does seem as though your app's marginal value has to be
*  extremely high if it is to avoid being bulldozed by either OpenAI itself or one of the big tech
*  companies like Google and Microsoft, or even later stage startups that are rapidly rolling out AI
*  enabled features in their products. As two analysts at NEA, an investment firm, put it in a recent
*  report, generative AI may not be as disruptive to established businesses and beneficial to startups
*  as previous big shifts in tech platforms. Unlike with the prior shifts, incumbents do not need to
*  re-architect their entire products to adopt this new platform shift, the analysts wrote. In addition,
*  this shift favors companies with bigger proprietary data sets, which can give an edge to more
*  established companies. During previous tech eras, startups could introduce a superior technology or
*  interface and then race to build market share before entrenched competitors could match them.
*  But with large language models, incumbents like Google and Microsoft have had a huge head start
*  in both developing the technology and acquiring market share among consumers.
*  The situation risks becoming like that of the pharmaceutical industry,
*  in which research and development is outsourced to startups and many of the benefits ultimately
*  accrue to the parent company. Moreover, the capital-intensive nature of training large
*  language models means that smaller companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, creating their own
*  large language models, have few alternatives beyond making Faustian partnerships with tech giants.
*  This doesn't mean that generative AI isn't going to transform industries or eliminate jobs,
*  beyond the incumbents, one beneficiary might well be the indie hacker, the kind of coder for hire
*  who does niche AI projects to fill specific needs in specific industries. Problems that have been
*  too esoteric to solve or workflows that have been too complicated to improve might become easily
*  automated with the help of chat GPT. As the Gumroad founder Sahil Lavinkea recently put it on a podcast,
*  if I had a friend who's like, I want to make 200k a year building something in SAS,
*  software as a service, building some AI tool, I would basically tell them to walk around their
*  neighborhood, go to as many businesses as possible and see what manual thing, what piece of paper you
*  sign and figure out how to automate that. That the era of VC backed outsize returns might be coming
*  to an end is of course a source of anxiety. Everyone in Silicon Valley knows someone who
*  worked at the last generation of successful startups, startups whose growth followed the
*  proverbial hockey stick line on a graph and reaped the benefits. Who doesn't want to get their share,
*  whether money, status, fame, before it all runs out? This anxiety is compounded by the
*  fact that it feels as if the deterioration of the physical world is happening roughly at a pace with
*  the flourishing of the virtual one. And the only way to insulate yourself is by achieving vast
*  financial success. In some ways, San Francisco perfectly embodies this tension. AI is moving
*  toward AGI, but outside the high end tech offices, there is rampant homelessness. House prices are so
*  high that even couples with two tech incomes can't afford to buy property, and children are
*  sufficiently rare as to make them a spectacle. But the anxiety runs deeper than concerns about success,
*  prestige or even material safety. Change has always been accompanied by hand-wringing,
*  and the pace of change in AI right now is mind-bending. The resulting mood is perhaps
*  best encapsulated by tweets from Tiago Forte, the productivity guru known for a self-help system
*  called Second Brain. I'm feeling a broad loss of motivation for many projects and goals that used
*  to excite me due to what I'm seeing with AI. Forte posted in April. It's not fear of AI apocalypse,
*  or fear that I'll lose my job or anything like that. More like a feeling of grief that many of
*  the personal skills and qualities I've spent a lot of time developing have suddenly been devalued.
*  This, of course, is not a new kind of ennui. It has always been a bewildering experience to lose
*  your livelihood because of technological change. Silicon Valley has just generally been on the
*  right side of it. For the first time, such change heralds an era in which software engineers
*  themselves may be less well compensated and less in demand. After years of disrupting other industries,
*  Silicon Valley has disrupted itself.
*  Back at the Archbishop's mansion, 52 general partners from the Valley's top venture capital
*  funds were in attendance as the year's first batch of HF Zero fellows made their presentations
*  at Demo Day on April 4th. A few days later, Fontenot posted a behind-the-scenes video of the event.
*  It started with drone footage zooming in on the mansion, then cut to a close-up of Adam Rees,
*  a fellow, jittery with nerves before his presentation.
*  Y'all, this room is f***ing stacked, Fontenot said in the video.
*  So, anyway, he was wearing a pink wooly winter hat with a pom-pom, inexplicably,
*  and he sounded like Caesar rallying the troops. Two weeks after Demo Day, all 10 teams had received
*  initial offers from outside investors, and some had chosen lead investors.
*  Fontenot was optimistic. HF Zero's next batch, to be hosted again at the mansion,
*  was set to begin in May, and as he was reviewing applications, he texted me,
*  the talent coming in now is insane. A few days later, I saw on Twitter that a friend of mine,
*  Travis Fischer, would be joining the next HF Zero batch. He and I last hung out in real life
*  two years ago. At the time, the hot thing was the creator economy, and he was looking to develop
*  tools that would enable people, particularly open-source software developers, to monetize
*  their work. While that effort in the end wasn't fruitful, last year he started a series of side
*  projects in AI. These included coming up with a way for other developers to use the chat GPT
*  API so they can more easily incorporate large language models into their products.
*  Travis no longer talks as much about the creator economy. At HF Zero, he is now working on an open
*  source framework for building reliable AI agents that do things such as booking airplane tickets
*  or submitting tax documents. But despite the shifts in theme, my sense is that what he's
*  passionate about, making tools for the open source community, hasn't changed. He has just found a way
*  to come at it from a different angle. And in that adaptability, that ability to reinvent himself
*  while coming out on top, he resembles Silicon Valley itself.
