# Trump Liable for Sexual Abuse
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5dak5dDdBM)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Abaro. This is a daily.
*  Today, a jury in Manhattan has found former President Donald Trump legally liable for
*  sexually abusing and defaming the writer E. Jean Carroll, and has ordered him to pay her
*  millions of dollars in damages.
*  My colleague Ben Weiser tells the story of how a nearly 30-year-old allegation reached
*  this moment.
*  It's Wednesday, May 10th.
*  Ben, good evening. I know it's late. It's 8, 10 p.m. So thank you for making time for us.
*  Of course, Michael.
*  Can you just describe where exactly you are?
*  Yes, Michael. I am presently in the press room of the Federal Courthouse for the Southern
*  District of New York in Lower Manhattan, where we just finished covering a major trial, the
*  lawsuit brought by E. Jean Carroll, who had sued Donald Trump, accusing him of rape.
*  And I want to get to that case, that trial, and ultimately to the verdict and what it
*  means. But I want to start with, Ben, the unexpected and in a lot of ways, improbable
*  legal journey that brought E. Jean Carroll's case to this point. So tell us that story.
*  This case stemmed from an incident that occurred in the mid-1990s when E. Jean Carroll, a prominent
*  advice columnist for Elle magazine in New York, said that she had a chance encounter
*  with Donald Trump.
*  Yeah. Well, thank you for your trust and for this. I think it's really important.
*  Right. And of course, our colleague Megan Toohey actually interviewed E. Jean Carroll about
*  this allegation for an episode of The Daily that ran back in 2019.
*  That's right.
*  But can you walk us through what happened this particular day? You had been at the studio
*  where you and Carroll work.
*  Yes. And I wanted to shop for something. I can't remember what it was.
*  She went shopping after work at Bergdorf Goodman, a very luxury department store on 5th Avenue
*  in Manhattan.
*  He was standing outside and it was dark. So it must have been 630, maybe 7. He went like
*  this when he saw me through the door. He like, stand there and stopped me by going like that.
*  Made a gesture, like held up his hand.
*  Yeah, held his hand like that.
*  And as she's leaving, right through a revolving glass door, she bumps into Donald Trump.
*  And he came through the door and he said, you're that advice lady. And I said, you're
*  that real estate mogul. He said, come advise me. I want to get a gift. I was like, this
*  is charming. Oh, boy. I said, yes. I asked him who it was for. He said a girl.
*  And Trump said he was there to buy a present for a girl. That was what she said. And asked
*  Carroll, the advice columnist, to advise him.
*  And I am just having such an engaging time because I have Donald Trump in tow. And he
*  is asking for my advice. I'm like, thrilled that this is happening.
*  Why are you so thrilled?
*  Because it's Donald Trump and I've got it. It's just delicious. Because he asked me for
*  my advice. It's for a girl right up my alley. I'm just thinking this is it.
*  You know, E. Jean Carroll had also once written for Saturday Night Live. And she said she
*  thought this would just be a great story to tell her friends later.
*  And at that point, he said lingerie. Or he may have said panties. He may have said underwear.
*  But I have the impression we started to go up the escalator. We went to whatever floor
*  the lingerie was on. And we walked in. There was a counter on the left. And there was nobody
*  there. And there was a, it looked like a filmy, sort of see-through gray. And when he picked
*  it up, I could see it was a bodysuit. He said, go put this on.
*  I said, you put it on. And then the scene really started. I'm thinking, this is terrific.
*  This is terrific. He says, it looks like it would fit you. I said, no, it goes with your
*  eyes. And he, there was a little bit of banner back and forth, which I was loving. And I
*  was laughing. And he went like this towards the dressing room. And I'm thinking, I'm actually
*  laughing out loud thinking, I'm going to make him put this bodysuit over his pants. That
*  is the ski. And I'm thinking this is going to be the funniest thing I have ever seen
*  in my, I've got a picture in my head as we're walking, him going like this and putting it
*  on. That's what I'm thinking. And we walk in the dressing room. I'm in front of it.
*  I pass in front of him. He shuts the door and just pushes me against the wall. Boom.
*  And kiss me. And I was continuing to laugh. And that's when I started to push him back.
*  And that's when he started to lean forward. And that's when he put his weight against me.
*  And he has two free hands because his shoulders here. The shoulders leaning into you. Yeah.
*  Holding me against the thing. And one of his hands went under in between the plasmas coat
*  and pulled down my tights, not off the way down. And he ran his fingers around looking,
*  anyway, whatever he was doing, he was looking for my vagina, I guess, and assuming that it hurt.
*  And so it had to be with the other hand as he held me, he unzipped his pants. Now he could have
*  unbuckled them. I don't know. He could have unbuttoned them, but pretty soon he had the tights down,
*  his penis in this hand and inserted it briefly. I don't think it was all the way. I don't. And it
*  was not long. Let's not put a time limit on it. I'm struggling. How long could it be? Couldn't be
*  long. And what did you do next? I may have tried to hit him with my purse. I don't know.
*  I don't know what I did with this hand. I have no idea. The thing I clearly remember is that
*  that's what I clearly remember. Trying to stop his feet. Well, I have to get my knee up to get him
*  off. Right? I got this knee up just slightly enough to back up. I didn't say a word. Anyway,
*  so push him up, backed up. And then I just went down. I either went in the escalator or the elevator.
*  I don't know.
*  She struggles to break free and ultimately does and flees the store. And her first instinct is to
*  call one of her close friends, Lisa Birnbach, a journalist and author in New York. And she recounts
*  exactly what happened. Lisa tells her, go to the police. You've been raped. She talked to another
*  friend, Carol Martin, a day later, a news anchor in New York. She said, don't go to the police.
*  Donald Trump has hundreds of lawyers and they'll bury you. And that's the route she took. She
*  decided to tell nobody. She swore her friends to secrecy and kept that secret for more than 20 years.
*  And so it's not until 2019 when she writes a book about women's bad experiences with men
*  that she includes her own story with Mr. Trump. And that section is excerpted in New York Magazine
*  before the book comes out. And it is published in June. And that is the first time that E. Jean
*  Carroll went public with her allegation that Trump had raped her. Right. I remember reading that piece.
*  We all read that piece. Donald Trump was president at the time and it was a bombshell excerpt from
*  her book. That's right. And Trump attacks her viciously. He says it never happened. And he adds,
*  you know, she's not my type. But E. Jean Carroll was unable to hold Trump legally accountable for
*  this alleged attack. The statute of limitations for criminal action had long run. And many women
*  in New York and elsewhere who claim they've been sexually assaulted and in many cases years ago,
*  were in a similar situation. But then everything changed in New York.
*  State lawmakers who were moved by allegations from all kinds of women, certainly also by the
*  force of the Me Too movement, draft a very unusual law. And it grants people who say they are survivors
*  of sexual offenses a new one-year window in which they can file a lawsuit, civil claims,
*  alleging abuse, sexual abuse, even if it occurred decades ago. And even if before this law was
*  passed, the statute of limitations would have barred any such legal action. And you know,
*  Michael, one of the key proponents of this law was E. Jean Carroll. And when lawmakers were
*  considering creating this law, she went to Albany, spoke at a news conference at the Capitol alongside
*  sexual abuse survivors. And she sent passionate letters to assembly members calling for the law
*  to be passed. She said in one of them, I stayed silent for years after I was attacked and by
*  staying silent, lost my chance to hold my attacker accountable. And then.
*  Good morning. I wanted to make sure we start approximately on time because
*  people have waited long enough. That law did pass. I'm so proud in a matter of minutes
*  that I'll sign the Adult Survivors Act with our incredible sponsors. It creates a one-year look
*  back window for adults. And that one-year window in which sex abuse survivors could file a lawsuit
*  opened on Thanksgiving Day, November 24th of 2022. And I checked the court docket and sure enough,
*  minutes after midnight, E. Jean Carroll filed a lawsuit under the new law against Donald Trump,
*  accusing him of rape. But there's an important caveat to this law. It allows only for civil
*  suits, not criminal charges. There's no police arresting anybody. It doesn't put anyone behind
*  bars. But it does allow a survivor of sexual abuse to seek damages and try to hold their abuser
*  accountable financially and also reputationally. So very interestingly, E. Jean Carroll can now
*  use this law that she's personally pushed for and has now passed to hold Donald Trump accountable
*  for this alleged rape in a way that without this law would not have been legally possible.
*  That's right. But, you know, it's one thing to be able to bring a lawsuit.
*  It's another thing to prove it, especially when it's an allegation that dates back decades.
*  We'll be right back.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So then tell us about this trial, this civil trial, and what the legal burdens are for E.
*  Jean Carroll, exactly. Michael, you know, in a criminal case, the standard of proof is very high
*  to find somebody guilty of a crime. It's, we all know it is called beyond a reasonable doubt.
*  But in a civil case, which this is, the standard is much lower. So, for example,
*  for Miss Carroll to prove battery, which is the term that means an assault and covers
*  the alleged rape, she merely had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence, which, as the judge
*  pointed out today, simply means more likely than not. Some people say it's like one-tenth of a
*  percent, more than 50 percent possible. So as you can see, it's a much lower standard of proof
*  than would be needed in a criminal trial. Got it.
*  And as this case was filed, it also included an account of defamation. Miss Carroll said that
*  Donald Trump had defamed her, harmed her reputation because of statements he posted last October on
*  his social media account, Truth Social, when he called her case a complete con job, a hoax,
*  and a lie. And he said, and while I'm not supposed to say it, I will, this woman is not my type.
*  He reiterated that. And so this lawsuit went to trial a couple of weeks ago in the federal court
*  here on two counts. One was battery, the accusation that he had raped her, and the other was defamation.
*  And the suit sought damages, money damages for these two acts.
*  So once this trial starts, what is the case that E. Jean Carroll and her lawyers present to the jury?
*  The case begins with E. Jean Carroll herself. She's the main witness in the case.
*  She testifies over several days. And she tells her story in graphic detail about what happened.
*  And the rest of the trial largely witnesses another 10 or so called by her lawyers, who all bolster her
*  account in some way or another. The two friends that she talked to immediately after the assault,
*  they completely confirm that she had told them about it those days right afterwards.
*  So even though this is nearly 30 years old, there is a contemporaneous account essentially given
*  by two friends. And they describe in different ways how she told them what had happened. And
*  it's largely the story she told the jury earlier. Right. And as we've come to understand
*  contemporaneous accounts, people who say, I was told something happened at the time,
*  have become very important in trials and in cases of sexual assault.
*  That's absolutely right, especially when there's no other contemporaneous report being made,
*  whether it's to the police or to a doctor, for example. And two other witnesses who appeared
*  testified at the trial that they were also assaulted by Donald Trump years ago. One,
*  Jessica Leeds, a former stockbroker, testified that Trump had groped her and kissed her without
*  her consent on an airplane in the 1970s. And Natasha Stoynov, a former writer for People
*  magazine, said that when she was at Mar-a-Lago interviewing Trump, he lured her into a room,
*  pushed her against the wall and kissed her without her consent. Those two accounts had enough
*  relevance to Ms. Carroll's allegation that the judge allowed both of those women to testify
*  on her behalf. Got it. Presumably because the judge felt that they might help establish a pattern.
*  That's right, Michael. And in addition to witnesses who were called by E.G. and Carol,
*  the one man who was not at the trial, Donald Trump, made his presence known in several ways.
*  One was a tape that by now is notorious and probably everybody's heard of it, the so-called
*  Access Hollywood tape. Which surfaced in 2016.
*  And on it, Trump brags in crude terms about his ability to grab the genitals of women.
*  And Ms. Carroll's lawyers played it because what Donald Trump actually says in that tape,
*  in some ways, again, supports E.G. and Carol's argument that that's what he did to her.
*  And I might add that E.G. and Carol's lawyers deposed Donald Trump last fall,
*  asked him questions under oath. And he was videotaped and he also appeared in that video
*  at the trial. They played it for the jury. Are you familiar, I'm sure you are, with something
*  that's often referred to as the Access Hollywood tape? Yes, I am. And Carol's lawyers asked him
*  in their deposition, in that video deposition, about his claim that as a celebrity,
*  as a star, as he put it, he was able to grab women by the genitals.
*  You could do anything. That's what you said, correct?
*  Well, historically, that's true with stars.
*  And his response was, well, historically, that's true with stars. And so the lawyer,
*  Roberta Kaplan, poor Ms. Carroll, says, it's true with stars? And Trump says,
*  well, that's what it's if you look over the last million years, I guess that's been
*  largely true, not always, but largely true. Unfortunately or fortunately.
*  I guess that's been largely true. And then he says, unfortunately or fortunately. And that's
*  what the jury heard him say and watched him say at the trial. So in a sense, by the time E.G. and
*  Carol's presentation is finished, they have established her claim. They have established
*  that it's been corroborated contemporaneously in conversations with friends. They have established
*  that Donald Trump has allegedly done this to other women. And they have shown a video in which Donald
*  Trump talks about his feeling that he can do this kind of thing to women. And then in a deposition,
*  he doesn't really deny having said it or the fundamental sentiment that it represents.
*  That's right.
*  So then what about the defense? What kind of a defense does Donald Trump mount in this civil
*  case? So Trump's lawyers presented no witnesses on his behalf. None. None. And of course,
*  Donald Trump himself, who could have been a witness, did not come to the court. He did not
*  attend the trial and he did not testify on his own behalf.
*  Do you understand why that was their strategy?
*  Well, it's still unclear to me if the defense really wanted Donald Trump to testify. I'm not
*  sure, given his position, his total denial that this happened, how much more he would have added.
*  Trump was not acknowledging he'd even seen E.G. and Carol or been with her that night at the store.
*  And his own lawyer, Joseph Takapina, essentially said that he didn't need witnesses. And
*  Takapina told the jury, who would we even call to the witness stand? How do you prove a negative?
*  But without any witnesses on his behalf, essentially the defense presented by Donald
*  Trump and through his lawyer, Joseph Takapina, was carried out through cross-examination of
*  Ms. Carol and her witnesses. With Ms. Carol, Mr. Takapina focused on the fact that she had not
*  gone to the police, that this attack had occurred in a very popular luxury department store where
*  nobody had been there to see it. He highlighted also the fact that she couldn't actually remember
*  the precise date this occurred. In the lawsuit, Ms. Carol simply said that the rape had occurred
*  sometime in the mid-1990s, 1995, 1996. In the trial, she was able to move down to early spring
*  of 1996, but there was no day. And essentially, Takapina was saying, this is such an important
*  thing that happened. You can't even tell us when it happened. And one of the most heated moments
*  during the trial was during Mr. Takapina's cross-examination of Ms. Carol, when he basically
*  asked why she had not screamed for help. And he went through a series of questions, and she finally
*  said, I'm not a screamer. She said she was in a panic. She was fighting. She said, you can't
*  beat up on me for not screaming. And Mr. Takapina said he wasn't beating up on her. But Ms. Carol,
*  her voice rising, said from the witness stand that women often keep silent about an attack because
*  they fear being asked what they could have done to stop it. They're always asked, why don't you
*  scream? And she said, I'm telling you, he raped me, whether I screamed or not.
*  Hmm. So Trump's lawyer, and it's not clear that it's hugely successful, is trying to portray
*  E. Jean Carroll as an untrustworthy teller of this story.
*  That's right. And Trump's lawyer also made it very clear that, in his view, this lawsuit was a scam
*  and that Ms. Carol had brought it for status and political reasons. And he argued that she was
*  doing this fine. She had gotten a lot of publicity for her book and had gotten more well known. And
*  he said that Donald Trump doesn't have a story to tell here other than to say it's a lie. And that
*  pretty much summed up the argument he made. Mm-hmm. I'm curious what you were thinking,
*  Ben, as this case comes to a close and gets handed to the jury.
*  You always think when you're watching a case, how will the jury react? And what made this such
*  a mystery is that for some very specific reasons, and unlike most trials, Michael,
*  this jury was completely anonymous. Hmm. Usually we can find out the names of jurors and something
*  about them when they're being interviewed in the pre-trial jury selection process. But the judge
*  here expressed concern that if the jurors' identities were known, they could possibly be
*  subject to harassment or worse by supporters of Mr. Trump or by anybody who was unhappy with the
*  decision. So, Ben, that brings us to Tuesday morning. The jury has the case. I had expected
*  them to need a lot of time. They didn't. They needed just a few hours. That's right. In less
*  than three hours, they came back with a verdict. There were no notes, no questions. No one was
*  asking for testimony to be read back. The jury came back very quickly for any case, but certainly
*  for this kind of case with a verdict. Mm-hmm. And just walk us through that verdict, because it's a
*  little bit complicated. So when the jury took the case, they had a lot of questions before them.
*  But in essence, it asked, did Ms. Carroll prove by a preponderance of the evidence, which is to
*  say more likely than not, that Mr. Trump had raped Ms. Carroll as she accused him or something less?
*  And the option was given of sexually abusing Ms. Carroll, and that's what the jury chose. They did
*  not say he raped her, but they said that she had proven that he had sexually abused her, which also
*  meant that they believed that the two of them had been at the store together and that Trump
*  had assaulted her, which you remember, he denied everything. He denied even knowing her being at
*  the store or any aspect of her allegation. Got it. The jury also went through a series of questions
*  on the defamation claim that she had filed and ultimately found that he had defamed her. And
*  eventually, when you add it all up, awarded her $5 million in damages to compensate her for both
*  the impact of the sexual abuse as well as the harm to her reputation that was done by the
*  defamatory statements on truth social. But how did you interpret that ultimate verdict?
*  How do you make sense of it? Michael, of course, we don't know for sure. We can't
*  talk to the jurors. As I said, they were anonymous. But even though the jury did not find that Trump
*  raped Ms. Carol and instead found that he sexually abused her, overwhelmingly, I think this is a
*  verdict against him. And E. Jean Carroll certainly saw this as a victory today. She said after court
*  in a statement, I filed this lawsuit against Trump to clear my name and get my life back.
*  And she said, today, the world finally knows the truth. Ben, it strikes me that you have now covered
*  several of the most important cases stemming from the Me Too movement, the case of Jeffrey Epstein,
*  the alleged serial abuser of young women, and the trial of his longtime partner,
*  Ghislaine Maxwell, and now Trump. And when we think about the meaning of the Me Too movement,
*  it ultimately is holding powerful people, mostly men, accountable for how they treat
*  women. And it's hard to think of anyone more powerful than the former president of the United
*  States. That's right. And, you know, there's been a lot achieved in recent years. And certainly the
*  Me Too movement has made its force felt in a very important way. But this is a first. This is a
*  former president of the United States who had been accused by multiple women over the years
*  of sexual misconduct. And for the first time, one of those women has been able to hold him accountable
*  in a trial in a federal court. And wherever this goes, and whatever other cases are brought,
*  there's no question that it's a kind of milestone, I would think, legally and socially,
*  and it's going to resonate.
*  Well, Ben, thank you very much. We appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael, for having me.
*  On Tuesday night, Trump said that he planned to appeal the jury's verdict. Meanwhile,
*  one of the New York legislators who wrote the law that allowed E. Jean Carroll to sue Trump,
*  State Senator Brad Hoylman, said that the verdict demonstrated why the law was needed. Hoylman said,
*  quote, There should be no limit on survivors bringing their abusers to justice.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. On Tuesday night, President Biden and House Speaker
*  Kevin McCarthy emerged from a high stakes meeting at the White House with no consensus
*  on how to avoid a financial crisis when the government hits its debt ceiling on June 1st
*  and can no longer pay its bills.
*  Everybody in this meeting reiterated the positions they were at. I didn't see any new movement.
*  The president said the staff should get back together.
*  Both sides stuck to their original bargaining positions, with Biden demanding that Congress
*  raise the debt ceiling unconditionally and McCarthy insisting that such a move be accompanied by big
*  spending cuts. Speaking to reporters afterward, McCarthy expressed frustration with the president.
*  After a nearly three month medical absence from the Senate that threatened to derail Democrats'
*  agenda, Dianne Feinstein returned to Washington on Tuesday night. Her return will restore a
*  Democratic majority to the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Democrats need her vote to
*  confirm federal judges and conduct investigations into the ethics of Supreme Court justices.
*  Feinstein had asked to be replaced on the committee by a fellow Democrat, but Republicans
*  blocked the move, making her return increasingly urgent.
