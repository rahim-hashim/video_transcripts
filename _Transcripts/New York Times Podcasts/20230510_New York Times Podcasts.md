*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Barrow. This is Adali.
*  Today, a jury in Manhattan has found former president Donald Trump legally liable for
*  sexually abusing and defaming the writer E. Jean Carroll and has ordered him to pay
*  her millions of dollars in damages. My colleague Ben Weiser tells the story of how a newly
*  30-year-old allegation reached this moment.
*  It's Wednesday, May 10.
*  Then, good evening. I know it's late. It's 8.10 pm. So thank you for making time for
*  us. Of course, Michael. Can you just describe where exactly you are?
*  Yes, Michael. I am presently in the press room of the Federal Courthouse, the Southern
*  District of New York in Lower Manhattan, where we just finished covering a major trial.
*  The trial over the lawsuit brought by E. Jean Carroll, who had sued Donald Trump, accusing
*  him of rape. I want to get to that case, that trial, and ultimately to the verdict and
*  what it means. I want to start with Ben the unexpected and in a lot of ways, improbable
*  legal journey that brought E. Jean Carroll's case to this point. Tell us that story.
*  This case stemmed from an incident that occurred in the mid-1990s when E. Jean Carroll, a prominent
*  advice columnist for Elle magazine in New York, said that she had a chance encounter with Donald
*  Trump.
*  Yeah. Well, thank you for your trust in for this. I think it's really important.
*  Right. And of course, our colleague Megan Tewi actually interviewed E. Jean Carroll about
*  this allegation for an episode of The Daily that ran back in 2019.
*  That's right.
*  Can you walk us through what happened this particular day? You had been at the studio, where you
*  and General were.
*  Yeah. And I wanted to shop for something. I can't remember what it was.
*  She went shopping after work at Pergdorf Goodman, a very luxury department store on Stithab
*  in New Manhattan.
*  He was standing outside and it was dark. So it must have been 630, maybe 7. He went like
*  this when he saw me through the door. He was like, stand there and stop me.
*  Made a gesture.
*  You held up his hand.
*  Yeah.
*  I held it in hand like that.
*  And as she's leaving right through a revolving glass door, she bumps into Donald Trump.
*  And he can't see the door. He said, you're that advice lady. And I said, you're that
*  little saint, he said, come advise me. I want to give a gift.
*  I was like, this is charming. Oh boy. I said, yes. I asked him who it was for. He said,
*  a girl.
*  And Trump said he was there to buy a present for a girl that was what she said and asked
*  Carol the advice columnist to advise him.
*  And I am just having such an engaging time because I have Donald Trump in tow. And he
*  is asking for my advice. I'm like, thrilled. This is happening.
*  Why are you so thrilled?
*  Because it's Donald Trump and I've got, it's just delicious because he asked me for my
*  advice. It's for a girl right up my alley. I'm just thinking, this is it.
*  You know, each in Carol it also once written for Saturday night live. And I, she said,
*  she thought this would just be a great story to tell her friends later.
*  And at that point he said lingerie or he may have said panties, he may have said underwear,
*  but I have the impression we started to go up the, the escalator. We went to whatever
*  floor the lingerie was on and we walked in. There was a counter on the left and there
*  was nobody there. And there was a, it looked like a filmy sort of see through great. And
*  when he picked it up, I can see it was a body suit. And he said, go put this on.
*  I said, you put it on. And then the scene really started, I'm thinking, this is terrific.
*  This is terrific. It's not, it looks like it will fit you. I said, no, it goes with your eyes.
*  And he, and there was a little bit of banner back and forth, which I was loving.
*  And I was laughing. And he went like this towards the dressing room.
*  And I'm thinking, I'm actually laughing out loud thinking, I'm going to make him put these
*  body suit over his pants. That is the scheme. And I'm thinking this is going to be the
*  funniest thing I have ever seen him. I've got a picture of my head as we're walking him
*  going like this and putting it on. That's what I'm saying. And we walked in the dressing room.
*  I'm in front of it. I passed him. He shuts the door and just pushes me against the wall.
*  And kiss me.
*  And I was continuing to laugh. And that's when I started to push him back.
*  And that's when he started to lean forward. And that's when he put his weight against me.
*  And he has two free hands because his shoulders here.
*  What is leaning into you? Yeah, holding me against the thing.
*  And one of his hands went under in between the plasmy coat and pulled down my
*  tides, not off, but way down. And he ran his fingers around looking.
*  Anyway, whatever he was doing was looking for my vagina. I guess I assume that it hurt.
*  And so it had to be with the other hand. As he held me, he's unzipped his pants.
*  Now he could have unbuckled him. I don't know. He could have unbuttoned him.
*  But pretty soon he had the tight stem, his penis in this hand and inserted it
*  breechly. I don't think it was all the way. I don't. And it was not long.
*  I'm the, let's not put a time on it. I'm struggling. How long could it be?
*  Couldn't be long. And what did you do?
*  I may have tried to hit him with my purse. I don't know.
*  I don't know what I did in the sand. I have no idea. The thing I would
*  declare remembers that. That's what I clearly remember.
*  Trying to stop this. Well, I have to get my knee up to get him off.
*  Right? I got, I got this knee up just slightly enough to back up.
*  I didn't say a word. Anyway, so push him up, back up.
*  And then I went down. Either one in the escalator or the other.
*  I don't know.
*  She struggles to break free and ultimately does and flees the store.
*  And her fructine stick just to call one of her close friends, Lisa Burnback,
*  a journalist and author in New York. And she recounts exactly what happened.
*  Lisa tells her, go to the police. You've been raped.
*  She talked to another friend, Carol Martin, a day later, a news anchor in New
*  York. She said, don't go to the police. Donald Trump has hundreds of lawyers and
*  criminals. Barrier. And that's the route she took.
*  She decided to tell nobody. She swore her friends to secrecy and
*  kept that secret for more than 20 years.
*  And so it's not until 2019 when she writes a book about women's bad experiences
*  with men that she includes her own story with Mr. Trump.
*  And that section is excerpted in New York magazine before the book comes out.
*  And it is published in June.
*  And that is the first time that E. Jean Carol went public with her allegation that
*  Trump had raped her.
*  Right. I remember reading that piece.
*  We all read that piece. Donald Trump was president at the time.
*  And it was a bombshell excerpt from her book.
*  That's right. And Trump attacks her judiciously.
*  He says it never happened. And he adds, you know, she's not my type.
*  But E. Jean Carol was unable to hold Trump legally accountable for this alleged attack.
*  The staffed limitations for criminal action had long run.
*  And many women in New York and elsewhere, you know, who claim they've been sexually
*  assaulted. And in many cases years ago, we're in a similar situation.
*  But then everything changed in New York.
*  State lawmakers who were moved by allegations from all kinds of women,
*  certainly also by the force of the Me Too movement,
*  draft a very unusual law.
*  And it grants people who say they are survivors of sexual offences.
*  A new one year window in which they can file a lawsuit, civil claims,
*  alleging abuse, sexual abuse, even if it occurred decades ago.
*  And even if before this law was passed, the statute of limitations would have barred
*  any such legal action.
*  And you know, Michael, one of the key proponents of this law was E. Jean Carol.
*  And when lawmakers were considering creating this law,
*  she went to Albany, spoke at a news conference at the Capitol alongside
*  sexual abuse survivors.
*  And she sent passionate letters to assembly members calling for the law to be passed.
*  She said in one of them, I stayed silent for years after I was attacked.
*  And by staying silent, lost my chance to hold my attacker accountable.
*  And then good morning.
*  I wanted to make sure we start approximately on time because people have waited long
*  enough. That law did pass.
*  I'm so proud in a matter of minutes that I'll sign the Adult Survivors Act with
*  our incredible sponsors.
*  It creates a one year look back window for a day.
*  And that one year window in which sex abuse survivors could file a lawsuit
*  opened on Thanksgiving Day, November 24th of 2022.
*  And I checked the court document and sure enough minutes after midnight,
*  E. Jean Carol filed a lawsuit under the new law against Donald Trump,
*  accusing him of rape.
*  But there's an important caveat to this law.
*  It allows only for civil suits, not criminal charges.
*  There's no police arresting anybody.
*  It doesn't put anyone behind bars, but it does allow a survivor of sexual abuse
*  to seek damages and try to hold their abuse or accountable financially and also
*  reputationally.
*  So very interestingly, E. Jean Carol can now use this law that she's personally
*  pushed for and has now passed to hold Donald Trump accountable for this
*  alleged rape in a way that without this law would not have been legally possible.
*  That's right.
*  But you know, it's one thing to be able to bring a lawsuit.
*  It's another thing to prove it, especially when it's an allegation that dates back
*  decades.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So then tell us about this trial, this civil trial and what the legal burdens are for
*  E. Jean Carol exactly.
*  Michael, you know, in a criminal case, the standard of proof is very high to find
*  somebody guilty of a crime.
*  It's the all know it is called beyond a reasonable doubt.
*  But in a civil case, which this is, the standard is much lower.
*  So for example, for Miss Carol to prove battery, which is the term that means an
*  assault and covers the alleged rape, she merely had to prove by a preponderance of
*  the evidence, which as the judge pointed out today simply means more likely than
*  not.
*  Some people say it's like one tenth of a percent more than 50% possible.
*  So as you can see, it's a much lower standard of proof than would be needed
*  in a criminal trial.
*  Got it.
*  And as this case was filed, it also included a kind of defamation.
*  Miss Carol said that Donald Trump had defamed her, harmed her reputation
*  because of statements he posted last October on his social media account, true
*  social.
*  When he called her case a complete con job of hoax and a lie.
*  And he said, and while I'm not supposed to say it, I will.
*  This woman is not my type.
*  He reiterated that.
*  And so this lawsuit went to trial a couple of weeks ago in the federal court
*  here on two counts.
*  One was battery, the accusation that he had raped her and the other was defamation.
*  And the suit sought damages, money damages for these two acts.
*  So once this trial starts, what is the case that Eugene Carol and her lawyers
*  present to the jury?
*  The case begins with Eugene Carol herself.
*  She's the main witness in the case.
*  She testifies over several days and she tells her story in graphic detail about
*  what happened.
*  And the rest of the trial was largely witnesses, another 10 or so called by
*  her lawyers who all bolster her account in some way or another, the two
*  friends that she talked to immediately after the assault, they completely
*  confirmed that she had told them about it those days right afterwards.
*  So even though this is nearly 30 years old, there is a contemporaneous account
*  essentially given by two friends and they describe in different ways how she
*  told them what had happened.
*  And it's largely the story she told the jury earlier.
*  Right.
*  And as we've come to understand contemporaneous accounts, you know, people who say,
*  I was told something happened at the time have become very important in
*  trials and in cases of sexual assault.
*  That's absolutely right, especially when there's no other contemporaneous
*  report being made, whether it's to the police or to a doctor, for example.
*  And two other witnesses who appeared, testified at the trial that they were
*  also assaulted by Donald Trump years ago.
*  One Jessica leads a former stockbroker, testified that Trump had
*  groped her in Tister without her consent on an airplane in the 1970s.
*  And Natasha Steuenoff, a former writer for People magazine, said that when
*  she was at Mar-a-Lago interviewing Trump, he lured her into a room
*  closer against the wall and Tister without her consent.
*  Those two accounts had enough relevance to Miss Carol's allegation that the
*  judge allowed both of those women to testify on her behalf.
*  God, presumably because the judge felt that they might help establish a pattern.
*  That's right, Michael.
*  And in addition to witnesses who were called by E. Jean Carol, you know,
*  the one man who was not at the trial, Donald Trump made his presence known in
*  several ways.
*  One was a tape that by now is notorious and probably everybody's heard of it.
*  The so-called access Hollywood tape.
*  You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful.
*  I just like kissing them.
*  It's like a magnet which surfaced in 2016.
*  And when you're started, I'd like to do it.
*  You can do anything.
*  Whatever you want.
*  Grab them by the pussy.
*  And on it, Trump brags in crude terms about his ability to grab the genitals
*  of women.
*  And Miss Carol's lawyers played it because what Donald Trump actually says
*  in that tape in some ways, again, supports E. Jean Carol's argument,
*  but that's what he did to her.
*  And I might add that E. Jean Carol's lawyers deposed Donald Trump last fall,
*  asked him questions under oath.
*  And he was videotaped and he also appeared in that video at the trial.
*  They played it for the jury.
*  Are you familiar?
*  I'm sure you are with something that's often referred to as the access Hollywood tape.
*  Yes, I am.
*  And Carol's lawyers asked him in their deposition, in that video deposition,
*  about his claim that as a celebrity, as a star, as he put it, he was able to
*  grab women by the genitals.
*  You could do anything.
*  That's what he said, Carol.
*  Well, historically, that's true with stars.
*  And his response was, well, historically, that's true with stars.
*  And so the lawyer, Roberta Catlin, poor Miss Carol says, it's true with stars.
*  And Trump says, well, that's what it's, if you look over the last million years,
*  I guess it's been largely, too, not always, but largely true.
*  Unfortunately, unfortunately, I guess that's been largely true.
*  And then he says, unfortunately, or fortunately, and that's what the jury heard,
*  Kim say and watched him say at the trial.
*  So in a sense, by the time Eugen Carol's presentation is finished,
*  they have established her claim.
*  They have established that it's been corroborated contemporaneously and conversations with friends.
*  They have established that Donald Trump has allegedly done this to other women.
*  And they have shown a video in which Donald Trump talks about his feeling that he can
*  do this kind of thing to women.
*  And then in a position, he doesn't really deny having said it or the fundamental
*  sentiment that it represents.
*  That's right.
*  So then what about the defense?
*  What kind of a defense does Donald Trump mount in this civil case?
*  So Trump's lawyers presented no witnesses on his behalf.
*  None.
*  None.
*  And of course, Donald Trump himself, who could have been a witness, did not come to the court.
*  He did not attend the trial and he did not testify on his own behalf.
*  Do you understand why that was their strategy?
*  Well, it's still unclear to me if the defense really wanted Donald to testify.
*  You know, I'm not sure given his position, his total denial that this happened.
*  How much more he would have added, Trump was not acknowledging he'd even seen
*  Eugen Carol or been with her that night at the store.
*  And his own lawyer, Joseph Techapino, essentially said that he didn't need witnesses
*  and Techapino told the jury, who would we even call for the witness then?
*  You know, how do you prove a negative?
*  But without any witnesses on his behalf, essentially the defense presented by Donald
*  Trump and through his lawyer, Joseph Techapino, was carried out through cross examination
*  of Miss Carol and her witnesses with Miss Carol.
*  Mr. Techapino focused on the fact that she had not gone to the police that this attack had
*  occurred in a very popular luxury department store where nobody had been there to see it.
*  Be highlighted also the fact that she couldn't actually remember the precise date that
*  in the lawsuit, Miss Carol simply said that the rape had occurred sometime in the mid 1990s,
*  1995, 1996.
*  In the trial, if he was able to down to early spring of 1996, but there was no day.
*  And essentially, Techapino was saying, this is such an important thing that happened.
*  You can't even tell us when it happened.
*  And one of the most heated moments during the trial was during Mr. Techapino's cross
*  examination of Miss Carol when he basically asked why she had not screamed for help.
*  And he went through a series of questions and she finally said, I'm not a screamer.
*  She said she was in a panic.
*  She was fighting.
*  She said, you can't beat up on me for not screaming.
*  And Mr. Techapino said he wasn't beating up on her.
*  But Miss Carol, her voice rising, said from the witness stand that women often keep
*  silent about an attack because they fear being asked what they could have done to stop it.
*  They're always asked, why don't you scream?
*  And she said, I'm telling you, he raped me whether I screamed or not.
*  So Trump's lawyer, and it's not clear that it's hugely successful, is trying to portray
*  Eugene Carol as an untrustworthy teller of this story.
*  That's right.
*  And Trump's lawyer also made it very clear that in his view, this lawsuit was a scam
*  and that Miss Carol had brought it for status and political reasons.
*  And he argued that she was doing to find, you know, she had gotten a lot of publicity for her book
*  and had gotten more well known.
*  And he said that Donald Trump doesn't have a story to tell here other than to say it's a lie.
*  And that pretty much summed up the argument he made.
*  I'm curious what you were thinking Ben as this case comes to a close and gets handed to the jury.
*  You always think when you're watching a case, you know, how will the jury react?
*  And what made this such a mystery is that for some very specific reasons and unlike most trials,
*  Michael, this jury was completely anonymous.
*  Usually we can find out the names of jurors and something about them when they're being interviewed
*  in the pretrial jury selection process.
*  But the judge here expressed concern that if the jurors' identities were known,
*  they could possibly be subject to harassment or worse by supporters of Mr. Trump or by anybody
*  who was unhappy with the decision.
*  So Ben, that brings us to Tuesday morning.
*  The jury has the case.
*  I had expected them to need a lot of time.
*  They didn't.
*  They needed just a few hours.
*  That's right.
*  It less than three hours.
*  They came back with a verdict.
*  There were no notes, no questions.
*  No one was asking for testimony to be read back.
*  The jury came back very quickly for any case,
*  but certainly for this kind of case with a verdict.
*  And just walk us through that verdict because it's a little bit complicated.
*  So when the jury took the case, they had a lot of questions before them.
*  But in essence, it asked, did Miss Carol prove
*  by a preponderance of the evidence,
*  which is to say more likely than not,
*  that Mr. Trump had raped Miss Carol as she accused him or something less?
*  And the option was given a sexually abusing Miss Carol.
*  And that's what the jury chose.
*  They did not say he raped her,
*  but they said that she had proven that he had sexually abused her.
*  We can also meant that they believed that the two of them had been of the store together.
*  And that Trump had a soldier,
*  which you remember, he denied everything.
*  He denied even knowing her being at the store
*  or any aspect of her allocation.
*  Got it.
*  The jury also went through a series of questions on the defamation claim that she had filed
*  and ultimately found that he had defamed her.
*  And eventually, when you added all up,
*  awarded her $5 million in damages to compensate her for both the impact of the sexual abuse,
*  as well as the harm to her reputation that was done by the defamatory statements on truth social.
*  But how did you interpret that ultimate verdict?
*  How do you make sense of it?
*  Michael, of course, we don't know for sure.
*  We can't talk to the jurors as I said, they were anonymous.
*  But even though the jury did not find that Trump raped Miss Carol
*  and instead found that he sexually abused her,
*  overwhelmingly, I think this is a verdict against him.
*  And Ejink Carol certainly saw this as a victory today.
*  She said after court in a statement, I filed this lawsuit against Trump to clear my name and get my life back.
*  And she said today the world finally knows the truth.
*  Ben, it strikes me that you have now covered several
*  of the most important cases stemming from the Mee-2 movement, the case of Jeffrey Epstein,
*  the alleged serial abuser of young women,
*  and the trial of his longtime partner, Galein Maxwell, and now Trump.
*  And when we think about the meaning of the Mee-2 movement,
*  it ultimately is holding powerful people, mostly men, accountable for how they treat women.
*  And it's hard to think of anyone more powerful than the former president of the United States.
*  That's right. And there's been a lot of chief in recent years.
*  And certainly the Mee-2 movement has made its force felt in a very important way.
*  But this is a first. This is a former president of the United States,
*  who had been accused by multiple women of the years of sexual misconduct.
*  And for the first time, one of those women has been able to hold him accountable in a trial
*  in a federal court.
*  And wherever this goes and whatever other cases are brought,
*  there's no question that it's a kind of milestone, I would think,
*  legally and socially, and it's going to resonate.
*  Well, Ben, thank you very much. We appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael, for having me.
*  On Tuesday night, Trump said that he planned to appeal the jury's verdict.
*  Meanwhile, one of the New York legislators who wrote the law that allowed E. Jean Carroll
*  to sue Trump, state senator Brad Hoylman, said that the verdict demonstrated why the law was needed.
*  Hoylman said, quote, there should be no limit on survivors bringing their abusers to justice.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Tuesday night, President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy emerged from a high-stakes meeting
*  at the White House with no consensus on how to avoid a financial crisis when the government hits
*  its debt ceiling on June 1st and can no longer pay its bills.
*  Everybody in this meeting reiterated the positions they were at. I didn't see any new movement.
*  President, President said the staff should get back together.
*  Both sides stuck to their original bargaining positions, with Biden demanding that Congress
*  raise the debt ceiling unconditionally, and McCarthy insisting that such a move be accompanied
*  by big spending cuts. Speaking to reporters afterward, McCarthy expressed frustration with the
*  President.
*  And, after a nearly three-month medical absence from the Senate that threatened to derail Democrats
*  agenda, Diane Feinstein returned to Washington on Tuesday night. Her return will restore a
*  democratic majority to the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Democrats need her vote to confirm
*  federal judges and conduct investigations into the ethics of Supreme Court justices.
*  Feinstein had asked to be replaced on the committee by a fellow Democrat, but Republicans
*  blocked the move, making her return increasingly urgent.
