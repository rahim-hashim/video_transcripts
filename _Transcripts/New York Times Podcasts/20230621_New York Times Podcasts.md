# The Re-Militarization of Germany
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXL8NraWSPk)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is a daily.
*  In the decades after World War II and the atrocities of the Holocaust, Germany has deliberately
*  under-invested in its military.
*  But that's about to change.
*  Today, my colleague, Katrin Benhold, a correspondent in Europe and a former Berlin bureau chief,
*  on why Germany is re-entering an era of militarization and what that will mean for its national identity.
*  It's Wednesday, June 21st.
*  Katrin, it is a rare treat to have you in the studio.
*  So thank you for being here.
*  Glad to be here.
*  You're not technically supposed to be here.
*  I mean, you're a European-based reporter at The Times.
*  And the reason you're here is because you're going to be filling in for my co-host, Sabrina
*  Tabernisi, who's on vacation.
*  Instead of hosting, we're going to begin this experiment with you as guests because you
*  came to us a couple of days ago and said that something that had happened in your home country,
*  Germany, was a big deal.
*  And I didn't see it right away, but I want you to explain what you meant by that.
*  Yes.
*  So last week, for the first time ever, Germany published a national security strategy.
*  Which sounds like something a country does.
*  It sounds kind of routine.
*  Totally.
*  And in a way, that's the point.
*  The US produces them all the time.
*  Most countries have them.
*  It's basically kind of the government's assessment of the main risks a country is facing and
*  how to deal with them.
*  But Germany, even though it's the biggest country in Europe, has never had one.
*  Not once, not ever.
*  Not once, not ever.
*  How can that be?
*  So, Michael, this being Germany, you have to go back to World War II.
*  Germany is the country that started the Second World War.
*  It's the country that brought destruction all over the continent.
*  It's the country that committed the Holocaust.
*  So after the war, after Germany was defeated, and remember it was now divided into East
*  and West, the Eastern part was now under the Soviet sphere and maintained a military.
*  But the Western part was basically told by the Western allies, we don't even trust you
*  to have a military.
*  So the military was disbanded.
*  And for a whole decade, West Germany didn't have an army.
*  At all.
*  At all.
*  In a way, that's kind of perhaps the origin of this cultural unease that Germans have
*  long felt until very recently with their military.
*  Germany was on the wrong side of history.
*  And that became very much part of this sort of national DNA and the kind of national identity,
*  I would say, that explains this cultural unease.
*  Ten years after the war, they were actually allowed to build up an army again, a new military,
*  a much more tightly regulated one.
*  West Germany is essentially the front line of the Cold War and is providing help to the
*  Americans and is building up quite a significant military.
*  But it's a military that is basically foot soldiers to America and to NATO.
*  It's not a military that in any meaningful way was leading.
*  So the outside world and internally within Germany, nobody yet wants a full-fledged military
*  that's seen as in support of Germans' national defense.
*  That's right.
*  After the war, nobody really trusted Germany to have a military.
*  And later on, you can say the Germans didn't really trust themselves to have a military.
*  So this reluctance to lead militarily, in some ways, it actually becomes reinforced
*  after the Cold War ends, the Berlin Wall falls, and suddenly Germany goes from being like
*  a front line state in this Cold War to being surrounded by friendly nations.
*  The Soviet Union no longer exists.
*  There's now Russia.
*  There's now a sense that war in Europe has become almost unthinkable.
*  So why spend on the military?
*  So not only is Germany not thinking about leading militarily, it's actually now starting
*  to cut military spending for like 15 years.
*  So Germany's kind of starving its military.
*  Yeah, to a point where Germany's military kind of becomes a national joke.
*  There's annual reports about how many helicopters don't fly, how many submarines don't swim,
*  how many tanks are not operational.
*  There were jokes about these soldiers basically in a military exercise using broomsticks instead
*  of actual guns because the shortages were so bad.
*  Thermal underwear, everything was kind of in short supply.
*  Meanwhile, Germany basically in the post-war decades has become this kind of economic powerhouse.
*  And its economy is very much built on this idea of exports and trade.
*  And that only becomes a bigger deal after the wall falls and the world opens up.
*  Germany has this business model that grows over time where it imports cheap energy, especially
*  gas from Russia, and exports a lot to China.
*  And remember, this is also the time when China's middle class expands like crazy.
*  And they start buying a lot of German cars, all these Mercedes Benz's and BMW's.
*  And this represents a huge economic force propping up the German economy.
*  So you have the situation where Germany's power is very much associated with its economy.
*  It's an economic power.
*  Right.
*  And as we've learned throughout the many decades, the more trade you do, in theory, the more
*  peace you cede.
*  Trade tends to prevent countries from invading each other and going to war with each other.
*  So it makes sense from what you're saying that Germany has another reason to think,
*  what do we need a big military for?
*  That was the theory.
*  But it turned out very differently.
*  Right.
*  Because one of its neighbors did the kind of unthinkable.
*  Absolutely.
*  Invaded Ukraine.
*  Exactly.
*  And that's when the whole model collapsed.
*  So that's the moment when Germany sort of has to realize that it had kind of been living
*  in an illusion.
*  And what's interesting is that they then jump into action.
*  And three days after the invasion, the Chancellor,
*  Olaf Scholz, stands up in parliament and describes the war as basically the beginning of a new
*  era.
*  He calls it Zeitwende, which in English means a change of an era.
*  Zeitwende.
*  That's not bad, Michael.
*  It's pretty good, almost as good as the American ambassador to Germany.
*  And just translate that again?
*  So Zeitwende technically means change of the times.
*  It's basically a turning point.
*  And everybody in Germany now uses that phrase.
*  It has kind of become almost like a meme.
*  It was the German word of the year in 2022.
*  It speaks to a realization that Germany basically has to change fundamentally because the world
*  has changed fundamentally.
*  There is a before and an after.
*  And so all these certainties about what Germans thought they and their country were, this
*  idea of kind of, you know, we're a peaceful post-war trading nation and we don't need
*  to be anything else, that broke away.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Katrin, what does this change of an era, I'm not going to try to dabble in German once
*  again, what does it actually look like?
*  So basically, since that speech, since the chancellor addressed parliament three days
*  after the war, started all these very powerful German taboos just tumble.
*  Germany has acknowledged its safety shortcomings are a problem that down the line could turn
*  into a crisis.
*  Europe's leading economy is now looking to also lead in regional security.
*  So on the one hand, they commit 100 billion euros to basically rearm.
*  German lawmakers say it will go towards major equipment purchases to strengthen the country's
*  combat readiness.
*  That's a big deal.
*  It's like two years worth of military spending.
*  To really start to invest in the military.
*  Yeah, to really go for it and make it operational again.
*  Issues that perhaps didn't seem crucial to Berlin a few years ago are now seen as potential
*  problems.
*  They also overturned this idea that you cannot send offensive weapons to a conflict area.
*  It takes some time and there's a lot of foot dragging initially.
*  I mean, they start out by offering Ukraine just 5,000 helmets, literally.
*  But eventually...
*  Well, this week, Germany also announced the arrival of 18 Leopard 2 tanks in Ukraine.
*  They do end up sending serious things like battle tanks and howitzers to Ukraine.
*  And now they're the second biggest military donor to Ukraine after the United States.
*  Germany says its overall goal is to send two tank battalions, each with about 14 tanks
*  apiece.
*  This is a big change, a big deal.
*  And perhaps an even bigger deal is that they end up weaning themselves off of Russian gas.
*  Germany has managed not only to replenish its stored gas, but has also built its first
*  terminal for imported liquefied natural gas.
*  And that was basically the kind of lifeblood of Germany's export economy.
*  Right.
*  And they take this very seriously.
*  Right, we talk about that a lot.
*  And, you know, all these changes basically go to the heart of Germany's postwar identity
*  as essentially this kind of pacifist exporting nation that was quite happy to leave military
*  leadership to others.
*  And all this culminates a few days ago...
*  Germany has unveiled its first national security strategy.
*  With the publication of this first national security strategy.
*  A new security strategy for a new era.
*  And, Katrin, what does this national security strategy envision beyond the things that
*  you have just detailed that Germany has done to bolster its national defense since Russia
*  invaded Ukraine?
*  So, for the first time, and I think this is significant, Germany sort of acknowledges
*  that you can think about national security in a vacuum.
*  You have to think about it holistically.
*  It matters who you trade with.
*  It matters where you buy your energy.
*  It matters who you're dependent on strategically.
*  Because it might tie your hands in the future.
*  And this is, of course, a lesson that Germany learned very painfully with this war in Ukraine.
*  Because there was a very significant strategic vulnerability there.
*  And it sort of, in a way, the country had laid the trap for itself by becoming very
*  dependent on Russian gas.
*  Right.
*  And so, Germany was, in a sense, funding the war in Ukraine by paying for Russian gas
*  and made it really hard to suddenly come to Ukraine's defense because Russia could punish
*  it by turning off the gas.
*  Which it did.
*  Right.
*  But in a way, whether that lesson has been fully absorbed may really be tested elsewhere.
*  And that's in China.
*  And that's kind of one of the big parts of this report where, you know, some of the details
*  we don't know yet because there's going to be a whole section on China that will come
*  later.
*  This is the big question now in the room is how can Germany avoid making the same mistake
*  again?
*  There's a recognition that it's overly dependent on China.
*  More than a million German jobs depend directly on China and many more indirectly.
*  Almost half of all European investments in China are from Germany.
*  And almost half of German manufacturing businesses actually rely on China for some part of their
*  supply chain.
*  And in some ways, it's a much more complex dependency than that on Russian energy.
*  It's China's export market, which is huge.
*  Remember all those German cars going to the Chinese middle class.
*  But also, German industry relies on China for a lot of raw materials and technologies
*  that are very critical for that transition to a carbon neutral economy that everybody's
*  now committed to.
*  What's the specific fear that Germany has that China will do and under what circumstances?
*  So you know, very concretely, there's a scenario in which China invades Taiwan, which would
*  be very analogous in a way to Russia invading Ukraine.
*  Germany would want to come to Taiwan's defense.
*  Well this is the big question.
*  If you're very dependent on China, can you agree to economic sanctions that will cripple
*  your economy?
*  You know, if China decides to punish you.
*  Well, yeah, I mean, it would punish you.
*  You mean you are so dependent on trade with China that if you impose sanctions on China,
*  you are crippling your own economy.
*  This is the trap that Germany wants to escape, if you like.
*  But that's a tall order, given those dependencies.
*  And Germany is now realizing that is as big a national security question as what kind
*  of bullets are in the guns.
*  Exactly.
*  This question of how can other powers weaponize our dependencies and what does that do to
*  our ability, for example, to live up to our values, but also to protect our population
*  and to protect our prosperity.
*  So this is a big deal.
*  Okay, and what about further building up Germany's military?
*  What does this strategic plan say about that?
*  So at the most basic level, basically Germany wants to have a functioning military again.
*  I mean, it's interesting that the chancellor himself in that speech to parliament when
*  he first kind of declared this turning point, he actually said himself, you know, our planes
*  must fly or helicopters must fly or submarines must swim, our tanks must work.
*  So you know, there's a recognition that, you know, we're starting from a very low base
*  here.
*  Basically Germany is, you know, if you would summarize this paper, shifting from disarmament
*  to kind of a doctrine of deterrence.
*  And it wants to be serious about becoming a military leader that is kind of proportionate
*  to its economic size.
*  And it sees itself as having a responsibility, being, you know, Europe's biggest democracy,
*  biggest country.
*  It wants to be able to defend Germany, but also Germany's allies within NATO.
*  Right.
*  Your military is so big that your potential enemies think twice about doing something
*  they are literally deterred from doing it by your military might.
*  Until now, it sounds like Germany doesn't have that deterrent power.
*  It doesn't on its own.
*  But they now have ambitious targets to change that, right?
*  They have finally committed to spending 2% of their GDP on the military, something that
*  they had promised NATO allies, but that they had never done before.
*  And the other thing they've committed to is to kind of, you know, provide NATO with
*  three army divisions, fully operational army divisions.
*  And you know, one division is 20,000 men by 2031.
*  So this is, again, quite an ambitious target for Germany.
*  It's not something that it would be able to do now.
*  Right, because it's 60,000 soldiers.
*  Exactly, yeah.
*  There is one wild card, of course, and that is that when it comes down to actually drawing
*  up those military budgets in the years to come, there's no certainty that Germany will
*  be able to deliver on all that it's promised.
*  We'll have to wait and see.
*  But the commitment and the sheer ambition that it's stated now, those in itself are
*  remarkable.
*  So this is a very big shift that Germany is outlining and planning.
*  And I'm curious, Katrin, how Germans see this new mandate and identity for the country,
*  given the history and the reluctance and the pacifism we've been talking about.
*  How much it feels to Germans like a worrying development, or perhaps it's welcome as a
*  decision that kind of liberates Germany from that past.
*  It's a really interesting question.
*  What's striking is that there's been very solid support, not just for Ukraine in this
*  war with Russia, but also for the need of a reinforced German military.
*  And opinion polls very clearly show this.
*  So Germans, again, almost overnight with that invasion, have collectively kind of become
*  more comfortable with that idea, I would say.
*  Still it is a kind of cultural challenge.
*  And I would say that there still are a lot of Germans that are on the fence.
*  There are some that are reacting with concern.
*  But overall, there is support for this.
*  And I grew up with this.
*  I see when I'm in the United States how the military is feeded and celebrated and revered.
*  I see that at sport games, you guys have like a minute of silence, that veterans or even
*  soldiers get discounts and shops.
*  They're the earliest to board a flight.
*  They're the earliest to board the flight.
*  Well, that would not happen in Germany, partly because there's very few soldiers that actually
*  show themselves in uniform.
*  And that's changing now.
*  It's beginning to change.
*  I certainly remember growing up, and soldiers were being told not to wear uniform when they
*  exit their base, because it was just not popular.
*  They were kind of invisible in society.
*  I remember graffiti when I was growing up.
*  Soldiers are murderers.
*  All soldiers are murderers.
*  That culture ran very deep and that unease.
*  And the government has been trying to sort of rebrand the military for some time.
*  A few years ago, for example, soldiers who were walking around in uniforms were actually
*  allowed to take trains for free.
*  And that was kind of an effort to make them more visible in society and perhaps more normal.
*  I'm not sure things shifted that much at that point, but it was after the invasion when
*  suddenly perceptions did shift.
*  And I had this interesting moment about a year ago when I was dispatched by the Times
*  to Lithuania.
*  And I went to the NATO external border.
*  Lithuania is one of the three small Baltic states bordering Russia and Belarus, which
*  is a Russian ally.
*  And there are some German forces there as a deterrent, if you will.
*  And I was going there to watch a tank exercise.
*  And as somebody who's never been a war correspondent, this was a very kind of striking experience.
*  I mean, you're in the forest.
*  You're watching this real-time war game where they're practicing for a potential Russian
*  breach of this NATO external border.
*  Men in fatigue running out of caves and shooting and these very impressive vehicles, including
*  tanks.
*  And I remember looking at this and thinking to myself, wow, I'm feeling sort of grateful
*  to these soldiers, these German soldiers protecting the NATO border.
*  And it was such a surprising feeling because having grown up with this, I need myself towards
*  military uniforms, especially Germans in military uniforms.
*  It was sort of a striking experience.
*  And this may seem strange for Americans, but it was a real feeling.
*  What you're explaining here, and tell me if I have this right, is that this invasion of
*  Ukraine by Russia, it has inspired Germany to rethink the kind of national defense it
*  needs and the kind of military it needs.
*  And it sounds like it's also changing the way Germans feel about the very concept of
*  military and the soldier.
*  And the shame that defined that for so long is giving way to, it sounds like a pretty
*  unfamiliar feeling of pride.
*  Yes.
*  I think we're heading that way.
*  And that is definitely new.
*  The last time German troops were in Lithuania before that was during World War II.
*  As an invading force.
*  Absolutely.
*  And they killed 90% of the Jewish population there.
*  So this is kind of where we've come from.
*  And in many ways, this is how far we've come as a country.
*  Okay.
*  There's a huge but looming, as you can imagine.
*  And that big but is that you yourself, Katrin, have done a tremendous amount of reporting
*  about extremism in the German military culture.
*  You've reported on raids that the German government has done with groups that include former members
*  of the military who were attempting to overthrow the German government.
*  You've done reporting on Nazi culture within the German military and extremism within the
*  German military that has prompted the German government to disband several units of the
*  German military.
*  So I have to ask if Germans and if you as someone who's covered this so closely are wary about
*  the kind of reemergence and the strengthening of the German military, given this, it feels
*  like kind of never quite ending tendency of extremism to creep into the German military
*  culture.
*  So I can totally see why people might be nervous about this.
*  And there's no question that Germany does have a problem with far-right extremism.
*  In the military?
*  It does.
*  I would say Germany has a problem with far-right extremism, like most liberal democracies at
*  the moment.
*  And the intelligence service calls far-right extremism and far-right terrorism the biggest
*  threat to German democracy.
*  It is particularly worrying when that infiltrates the armed forces and the police.
*  And we have done a lot of reporting on this.
*  And it's a serious threat.
*  It's mainly a terrorist threat.
*  It's not really a threat to the government in the sense that none of these groups that
*  we've written about and reported on had the capability to actually take down the government.
*  There's pretty clear consensus on that.
*  So the numbers are very small.
*  They're still extremely worrying.
*  And there's no question that this is an ongoing problem.
*  But the vast majority of German soldiers are loyal to Germany's constitution, are ready
*  to defend the country.
*  And the same intelligence services that call far-right extremism the biggest threat to
*  democracy are also saying that the vast majority of Germany's military is absolutely trustworthy.
*  So I would say when it comes to external threats, even Germany's immediate neighbors, countries
*  like the Central and Eastern European countries that were devastated by the Nazis, they are
*  now, if anything, angry at Germany for not doing enough military.
*  They want Germany to lead.
*  They're not scared.
*  They're scared of more German military.
*  They're scared of less Germany.
*  They want more Germany.
*  In other words, I remember the former Polish Foreign Secretary, Radek Sikorski, putting
*  it this way.
*  He basically said, I fear German power less than German inaction.
*  So this also signals to Germany that it just can't hide behind its history anymore when
*  it comes to military power.
*  And you know, if you want to go one step further, you could say, look, I mean, it took hard
*  military power to defeat Germany when Germany was the bad guy in World War II.
*  And now Germany sort of sees itself as a power that has a responsibility to help defeat the
*  bad guys.
*  And for that, it needs military power.
*  Well, Katrin, thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  After a years long investigation, federal prosecutors have reached an agreement with
*  Hunter Biden, the president's son, over tax crimes and a gun charge that will probably
*  keep Biden out of prison.
*  Under the deal, Biden will plead guilty to two tax crimes for failing to pay his taxes
*  in 2017 and 2018 and admit to buying a handgun during a period when he was using drugs.
*  His guilty plea, which is expected in the coming days, will likely end Hunter Biden's
*  legal woes, but not the congressional investigations into his behavior.
*  House Republicans still claim that Hunter Biden committed a variety of crimes, and one
*  of them, Representative James Comer of Kentucky, denounced the agreement with Biden as a, quote,
*  slap on the wrist.
*  And on behalf of all the men and women of the United States Coast Guard and our search
*  partners, we offer our most heartfelt thoughts and prayers for the five crew members, their
*  families and their loved ones.
*  The U.S. Coast Guard has searched an area the size of Connecticut to find a submersible
*  vessel that vanished in the Atlantic Ocean over the weekend with five people on board.
*  The 21-foot vessel, which was on a deep sea dive to explore the wreckage of the Titanic,
*  will run out of breathable oxygen in about 25 hours.
*  These search efforts have focused on both surface with C-130 aircraft searching by site
*  and with radar and subsurface with P-3 aircraft were able to drop and monitor sonar buoys.
*  To date, those search efforts have not yielded any results.
*  Even if the vessel is found, it will be difficult to retrieve because it may be two miles from
*  the water's surface and require the use of a remote-controlled rescue vehicle that's
*  unlikely to reach it in time.
