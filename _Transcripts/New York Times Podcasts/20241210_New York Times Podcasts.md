# The Manhunt, the Manifesto and the Murder Charge
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IyOVmZS1W8)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, the five-day manhunt for the killer of a health care CEO, what we know about the
*  suspect now in custody, and what the case has revealed about many Americans' contempt
*  for insurance companies.
*  It's Tuesday, December 10th.
*  On Wednesday morning of last week, the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare, Brian Thompson,
*  left his hotel in Midtown Manhattan for his company's investor conference a few blocks
*  away.
*  It was 645 in the morning, still mostly dark out, and as Thompson neared his destination,
*  a hooded and masked gunman emerged from behind a parked car, took out a gun with a silencer,
*  and began to fire at him over and over in what's clearly a targeted attack.
*  Chilling new details tonight following what police say was the premeditated murder of
*  the CEO of UnitedHealthcare on the busy streets of Midtown Manhattan early today.
*  Surveillance videos of all of this, which emerged a few hours later, shocked the city.
*  It was so surreal.
*  It's something that you would watch on a TV show or in a movie, this like in cold blood
*  assassination two blocks away from my house.
*  What I heard was that he ran up Sixth Avenue and into the park, and so, you know, that
*  would be like right here.
*  And just as shocking was how effortlessly Thompson's killer got away.
*  According to the NYPD, the shooter took off through an alley, grabbing an e-bike and riding
*  it into Central Park, which at that time was filled with morning runners and walkers.
*  By the end of the day, a massive citywide manhunt was underway.
*  Cops literally fan out across Central Park.
*  Hotel rooms are being searched.
*  Drones are put in the air.
*  New this morning, NYPD releasing surveillance photos of the suspected gunman at a New York
*  hostel without a mask.
*  Eventually, small pieces of evidence emerge.
*  A major discovery.
*  Police sources say they found a backpack believed to be the shooter's.
*  No gun was found inside.
*  What was found?
*  A jacket and Monopoly money.
*  And as speculation begins about why exactly this CEO was targeted, the question naturally
*  arises, was this about health care?
*  And the police reveal a single piece of evidence that suggests perhaps it was.
*  Law enforcement found shell casings at the crime scene with the words deny, defend and
*  depose written on them.
*  Those words are strikingly similar to a title of a book that condemns the insurance business.
*  Finally it looks like this murder and this missing suspect have tapped into something
*  much bigger.
*  I mean, every person in America has had a brush with the health care system that has
*  not been, you know, excellent.
*  I spoke with my colleague, Dionne Cerci, who writes about wealth and power in New York.
*  I got brought into this story last week, the day after the shooting, when I had noticed
*  a lot of posts on social media strangely in support of the shooter.
*  You know, some of the posts were very pointed and direct and just full of malice for the
*  victim, which is something that we don't usually see.
*  So I just started going through tweets and going through all the networks and collecting
*  just this kind of outrage over the health care system.
*  Let me just start off this video by saying I do not condone violence by any means, but
*  let's talk about what happened today with the UnitedHealthcare CEO.
*  Six months before my mom died, her health insurance let her know that all of the things
*  that she had been prescribed and insured for for the last 10, 15 years of her life were
*  no longer going to be covered.
*  There was some real anger that this unleashed.
*  Sitting in the emergency room with my one-year-old baby, she needed to be transferred to New
*  York City so she could have emergency brain surgery.
*  And instead, we sat in the hospital for three days because UnitedHealthcare refused to approve
*  the transfer via ambulance.
*  You know, moms who couldn't get an ambulance ride covered.
*  So my UnitedHealthcare story is that when my son needed a special type of bed because
*  of his disability, they denied us that.
*  Today is a beautifully ironic day for UnitedHealthcare to deny my injections for my cancer treatments.
*  There's no shortage of really painful experiences.
*  And I think why emotions are so heightened is because you interact with health insurance
*  companies at obviously some of the worst moments of your life.
*  When your kid is hurting or dying, when you are hurting or dying, I mean, you're keyed
*  up for some pretty charged emotions.
*  You know, maybe violence is not the way.
*  But have you read any of the comments on those videos reporting this story?
*  People are calloused.
*  People do not care because the health insurance companies do not care about their lives.
*  So plenty of people are not celebrating what happened here.
*  They're just seeing it as a chance to...
*  Event?
*  Yeah, to fume about it.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  You know, medical debt is insane right now in America.
*  And here's a guy who found a path, you know, to do something about it in the worst possible way.
*  And then on Monday morning, five days into this manhunt and this growing expression of
*  fury at the U.S. health care system, there's a major development in the story.
*  So I came this morning to the shack just to get a sense of the buzz.
*  I wasn't expecting that there would be a break in the case.
*  So I called my colleague, police reporter Maria Kramer, who works out of a small press
*  room inside the NYPD called the shack.
*  So I went upstairs and confirmed some tantalizing details, like they found monopoly money in
*  the backpack, that the canine units that are good at detecting guns had been deployed,
*  opposed to where the Greyhound Depot was.
*  So we were just going to do sort of a small update.
*  And then just as we were doing all that, boom.
*  It just very quickly developed that a man was taken into custody in Pennsylvania.
*  After the break, everything we now know about the suspect.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Maria, this is a fast moving story.
*  So I just want to acknowledge when we're talking to you.
*  It's 545 or so on Monday night.
*  And I want you to tell us based on what you know now, how this suspect was caught and
*  how this manhunt came to what looks like its end.
*  And then we'll get to what we're learning about who the suspect is and what truly motivated
*  him.
*  But let's just start with how he gets caught.
*  So what we learn from our police sources and from a news conference where the police address
*  the media.
*  Good afternoon, everyone.
*  Here this morning in Altoona, Pennsylvania.
*  On Monday morning at 914 at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania.
*  The suspect was in a McDonald's and was recognized by an employee.
*  You have an employee who notices a man eating in the restaurant.
*  And that employee recognizes this man as the man that was photographed on various surveillance
*  shots released by the New York Police Department as the person of interest in the shooting
*  of Brian Thompson.
*  He calls 911.
*  He calls the Altoona Police Department.
*  Responding officers questioned the suspect who was acting suspiciously and was carrying
*  They find a man sitting at a table looking at a laptop and wearing a blue medical mask.
*  And when an officer asks him to pull down his mask and asks if he's been to New York
*  recently, the man becomes quiet and starts to shake.
*  Upon further investigation, officers recovered a firearm on his person as well as a suppressor,
*  both consistent with the weapon used in the murder.
*  Eventually they search him and they find a gun.
*  They find a silencer and they find fake identification cards.
*  Also recovered was a fraudulent New Jersey ID matching the ID our suspect used to check
*  into his New York City hostel before the shooting incident.
*  There are many distinct pieces of evidence, especially the gun and the silencer that suggest
*  this is most likely their guy.
*  Exactly.
*  And the gun was a source of much debate online.
*  People were trying to figure out what this gun was.
*  And what it turns out to be is what we call a ghost gun.
*  You know, these are guns that are assembled from parts that have been printed out from
*  a 3D printer.
*  And this gun is capable of firing nine millimeter rounds, which are the rounds that were found
*  at the crime scene in New York.
*  What Maria do we begin to learn about this suspect, about who he is, about his biography?
*  So what we learn about this man is that his name is Luigi Mangione.
*  He's 26 years old and he seems to have come from a life of a lot of privilege.
*  He was born and raised in Maryland.
*  He went to a private school in Baltimore, the Gilman School.
*  He was a wrestler there.
*  He graduated as a valedictorian.
*  He goes on to have an Ivy League background, getting his undergrad degree and his graduate
*  degree at the University of Pennsylvania.
*  And from there, he starts working in tech.
*  He travels a little bit around the country, living in San Francisco and in Honolulu.
*  And he has a pretty interesting online presence.
*  It suggests he's really well read.
*  He's posting about books that he's read on Goodreads.
*  By all accounts, if you look at his background, he seems accomplished, but formal.
*  And according to the police, from what they have learned so far about him, he doesn't
*  have a criminal record.
*  There was one citation for him trespassing in Honolulu at a state park, but other than
*  that, his record is clean, at least according to what we know so far.
*  So what are we learning about how he goes from having no criminal record and having
*  this fairly normal existence to allegedly committing murder?
*  What are the police uncovering about any motivations?
*  So there's very little that we know about him personally to suggest that he was going
*  to go from valedictorian of his high school class and UPenn grad to the alleged killer
*  of an executive in New York.
*  There are some clues that the police are looking at.
*  And one of the big ones is this three page handwritten manifesto that the police find
*  on Luigi Mangione when he's arrested.
*  And what is in that manifesto, as best we know?
*  So in this 260 word handwritten manifesto, Luigi Mangione is appearing to take responsibility
*  for the murder, according to a senior law enforcement official who saw the document.
*  And he notes UnitedHealthcare's market, capitalization growing, and condemns companies like UnitedHealthcare
*  that quote, continue to abuse our country for immense profit.
*  And he also in a pretty haunting part of the document, he says, quote, these parasites
*  had it coming.
*  And quote, I do apologize for any strife and trauma, but it had to be done.
*  Wow.
*  Do we know if he himself personally had a bad experience with UnitedHealthcare?
*  We don't know if he had a personal experience with the insurance company.
*  But we do know that he had been in regular contact with his friends and his family until
*  about six months ago.
*  That's when he suddenly stopped communicating with them.
*  And his friends have told us that he had been suffering from a painful back injury at the
*  time.
*  And that's when communication went dark and his relatives and friends began to become
*  very anxious about him.
*  Why hadn't anyone heard from him?
*  The other thing we know is that in the last year, he had been writing many reviews on
*  Goodreads, specifically one about a book that was written by Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber
*  who mailed bombs to people that he felt were destroying the world with technology.
*  Ted Kaczynski killed three people and he was seen, he was a terrorist.
*  But in his review, Mr. Mangione describes him as a mathematics prodigy.
*  And he tells readers not to dismiss the book as the manifesto of a lunatic.
*  He praises him by saying that many of his predictions about modern society turned out
*  to be true.
*  So he was prescient.
*  And he specifically says that while he was a violent individual, rightfully imprisoned
*  for killing and maiming people, these actions, and this is a direct quote, while these actions
*  tend to be characterized as those of a crazy Luddite, however, they are more accurately
*  seen as those of an extreme political revolutionary.
*  So there's admiration in that review of a man who did terribly violent things.
*  To some degree in the name of stopping corporations from hurting the world.
*  Exactly.
*  So the working theory here would seem to be that Mangione, over some period of time, since
*  he left college, became somebody who identified with these efforts to take on corporate America,
*  perhaps specifically the healthcare industry, out of some belief, allegedly, that like the
*  Unabomber, he could single handedly hold them to account.
*  At this point, that is a theory that many people hold.
*  But we really don't know what happened to Luigi Mangione.
*  What awaits Mangione now in the legal system, assuming that police in New York line all
*  this evidence up and decide that he is their suspect in the murder of Brian Thompson?
*  So just a few minutes ago, Luigi Mangione arrived at the Blair County Courthouse in
*  Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania.
*  He was led out of the car by two officers who walked him in, his hands bound behind
*  his back.
*  And there was a huge media presence there.
*  Here he is being brought into a courthouse, not to face murder charges, but to face gun
*  charges.
*  He's there for preliminary arraignment.
*  And then what's going to happen is prosecutors there will decide whether they want to carry
*  against him in Pennsylvania, or if he can be extradited to New York for presumably,
*  potentially, murder charges for the killing of Brian Thompson.
*  So Maria, stepping back just a little bit, I'm curious at this point how you're thinking
*  about this overall case and the meanings that it's taken on.
*  We spoke earlier today with our colleague Dion Cerci about just how much this case,
*  before there was a named person of interest, before there was an arrest, has become about
*  America's health care system and people's frustration with it.
*  And of course, it's a cold-blooded murder, right?
*  And yet it's also become this referendum, it would seem, on a broken health care system
*  and populist rage over that.
*  So how are you kind of making sense of all of that as this case now moves into this next
*  phase of the actual criminal justice system?
*  And I think that's a really interesting question that I've been thinking about myself because
*  to the police, to prosecutors, to the detectives who've been looking into this and talking
*  to Brian Thompson's family and colleagues and friends, this is a homicide.
*  This is a murder they have to investigate.
*  This is a murder they have to solve.
*  To many in the public and even some officers that I've spoken with, it's something that
*  underscores the anger and the frustration at a system that they feel they have no control
*  over and yet it's such a huge part of their lives, their health care and how they pay
*  for it.
*  So I wonder, as this case unfolds, will the public's perception of him change as we learn
*  more about what motivated him when he did what he allegedly did, which is kill a man
*  who was heading to a meeting, a father of two, and a person who is missed by colleagues,
*  is missed by friends, is a human being.
*  To many, he represents this avaricious industry, but he's also a person who was murdered in
*  cold blood and his killer in the minds of the police, in the minds of investigators,
*  in the minds of prosecutors and his family and friends, he needs to be brought to justice.
*  So does this investigation reveal more about him that makes the public think twice about
*  this folk hero status that some have attached to him?
*  Oh, Maria, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you so much.
*  After we spoke with Maria, Mangione was charged with five crimes in Pennsylvania, including
*  carrying a gun without a license, forgery and falsely identifying himself to the authorities.
*  A few hours later, prosecutors in Manhattan charged him with murder.
*  On social media, an ex-account belonging to Mangione gained more than 200,000 followers
*  after his arrest, and the hashtag Free Luigi was trending across the platform.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  The Times reports that in a major legal defeat, Rupert Murdoch has lost his effort to change
*  his family's trust in a way that would lock in the right-wing editorial slant of his media
*  empire, which includes Fox News and The Wall Street Journal.
*  Murdoch, whose family trust originally gave all four of his children equal control of
*  the empire, had sought to rewrite it to give almost all that power to his eldest son,
*  Lachlan, who is far more conservative than his siblings.
*  But a Nevada court resoundingly rejected that effort, saying that it had been undertaken
*  in bad faith.
*  And in a closely watched trial, Daniel Penny, a former Marine who choked a fellow New York
*  City subway rider last year, was acquitted on a charge of criminally negligent homicide.
*  The case came to exemplify New York City's post-pandemic struggles.
*  Prosecutors alleged that Penny's actions killed Jordan Neely, who was homeless and
*  had a history of mental illness.
*  Their encounter began after Neely, who is Black, began yelling at and frightening fellow
*  subway passengers, prompting Penny, who is White, to put him in a chokehold.
*  Today's episode was produced by Stella Tand, Alex Stern, Lindsay Garrison, and Nina Feldman,
*  with help from Luke Vanderbrook.
*  It was edited by Paige Cowitt and Maria Byrne, contains original music by Diane Wong, Alisha
