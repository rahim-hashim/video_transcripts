# The Closing Arguments in the Trump Trial
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35HEVzKzfvQ)
*  First floor.
*  It's Tuesday.
*  It's 6.09 a.m.
*  Walking out of my apartment to return to the courthouse.
*  Today we get closing arguments.
*  To some extent we know what the prosecution is going to say.
*  We know their case.
*  The prosecution has a coherent story, but we haven't heard an alternative theory.
*  So this morning, Todd Blanch, Trump's lawyer, is going to try and give that alternate theory.
*  You see doubt with a good story.
*  What's that story going to be?
*  We'll find out pretty soon.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  On Tuesday, lawyers for the prosecution and the defense delivered their final arguments
*  to the jury in the criminal case of the people of the state of New York versus Donald J.
*  Trump.
*  As always, my colleague Jonah Bromwich was there.
*  It's Wednesday, May 29th.
*  Hello.
*  How's it going?
*  Oh, look at that.
*  Yes, we have a modest dinner prepared for you.
*  It's beautiful.
*  I know.
*  You've been at it since 6 a.m.
*  Court rental 8.
*  What's a guy to do for dinner?
*  Thank you.
*  Are you ready?
*  I'm ready.
*  Shall we start?
*  Let's start.
*  Jonah, this was a very big day in a very big trial.
*  Yeah, this trial has been happening for about a month and a half at this point.
*  It feels like every time I come in here or in any way communicate with the readers and
*  listeners and viewers of the New York Times, we talk about what a remarkable day it was.
*  But, of course, this is closings.
*  This is a huge day.
*  It's the last time the lawyers get to address the jury.
*  For the defense lawyers in particular, it's a day that comes with really serious stakes
*  because this case has been really prosecution driven.
*  They've charged Donald Trump with falsifying business records 34 times and they've charged
*  Trump with a conspiracy to suppress negative news about himself to aid his path to victory
*  in the 2016 election.
*  And the falsified documents were meant to cover up, prosecutors say, that conspiracy
*  to suppress that negative news.
*  So we've heard about all that.
*  Twenty witnesses from the prosecution, only two from the defense.
*  And the prosecution, I think it's safe to say, has put together this really tight, understandable
*  script.
*  They have a story that the jurors know well at this point.
*  And so the defense, of course, has questioned the prosecution's witnesses and they've talked
*  about some of the prosecution's evidence.
*  But they really are working off a script that they didn't themselves write.
*  And so on Tuesday, the defense finally got a chance to take that script and rewrite it
*  as they seek during their closing argument to convince the jurors that they should not
*  convict Donald Trump.
*  So take us into the courtroom for this closing argument from the defense and how it was that
*  they tried finally to rewrite this script.
*  So let me just make one point before I do that.
*  So the defense has a different burden than the prosecution.
*  The prosecution has to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt.
*  And the defense only has to pick off really realistically one juror, convince that juror
*  that he or she should not convict.
*  So one of the reasons we haven't seen a coherent story from the defense is because they don't
*  have that burden.
*  Right.
*  Still, closing arguments are this really important point where the defense can mount exactly
*  that a story that will be remembered by the jurors.
*  So in the courtroom today, Todd Blanch, the lead lawyer for Donald Trump, goes up the
*  lectern and he begins in the same place where he began his opening statement weeks and weeks
*  ago.
*  He says, quote, President Trump is innocent.
*  He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof.
*  Period.
*  From there, he begins to expand and to introduce, it seems like at that point, what's going
*  to be a pretty structured defense closing.
*  And it has these three distinct pillars.
*  Which are?
*  The first is that for all the flash and sizzle of the prosecution case, which is about a
*  porn star and presidential election, Blanch reminds jurors this is a documents case.
*  This is about falsifying business records.
*  So he seems to be saying, ignore that flash.
*  That's not what this is about.
*  Second, he says, Trump had nothing to do with those documents.
*  The documents were first produced by Michael Cohen, who sent invoices to the Trump Organization.
*  In order to be, as a reminder, reimbursed for the hush money payment he made to Stormy
*  Daniels in order to keep the relationship she says she had with Trump secret from the
*  voting public.
*  Yes.
*  And so the defense says that Trump was in D.C. this whole time while these documents
*  were being generated because, of course, Donald Trump was the president of the United States.
*  He was doing that job.
*  How could he have found the time, the defense argues, to produce what prosecutors say are
*  false documents and have any significant interaction with them?
*  And then finally, the third pillar of the defense closing argument, and the one that
*  we've seen throughout the trial, is attack Michael Cohen.
*  Because you can't trust Michael Cohen when he testified, for instance, that Trump directed
*  him to make the hush money payment.
*  And you can't trust Michael Cohen when he testified that in January 2017, Trump signed
*  off on the scheme to disguise the reimbursements as reimbursements for legal services rather
*  than what they really are, which is a reimbursement for a hush money payment to a porn star.
*  Then you can't trust the defenses arguing the prosecution's case and the whole thing
*  falls apart like asset cards.
*  Okay.
*  Those sound like three highly logical pillars of a defense closing argument.
*  So how does the defense try to lay those three pillars out?
*  And how do they actually end up laying them out in this closing argument?
*  So on that first pillar that Blanche identified, where he's saying that it's a paper case,
*  he refers to the documents that prosecutors say are false.
*  And what Blanche says is, no, Michael Cohen was being paid for legal services.
*  This wasn't a reimbursement.
*  This wasn't anything shady.
*  This was a personal lawyer to Donald J. Trump, who in 2017 was paid for being a personal
*  lawyer to Donald J. Trump.
*  Interesting.
*  So that's the first pillar.
*  So then he moves to the second pillar.
*  And Blanche just distances Trump from these documents.
*  He says that Trump was busy running the country, being the leader of the free world, and that
*  most of these documents really didn't have anything to do with him.
*  They were being generated by Michael Cohen or they were being generated by the Trump
*  organization.
*  There's even this issue of the nine checks that Trump signed himself.
*  And Blanche dismisses those because Trump was president as well.
*  He says, well, Trump may have signed those, but he was doing lots of stuff, meeting with
*  heads of state.
*  He may not have paid close attention to those checks that he signed.
*  This is meant to go toward Trump's intent and the fact that jurors can't really know
*  what Trump was thinking.
*  But this is where this closing argument, I think, starts to go a little bit off the rails,
*  because the prosecutors have introduced a lot of evidence, including evidence from books
*  that Trump himself wrote, that Trump pays very close attention to the inflow and outflow
*  of money, both from the Trump organization and from his personal accounts.
*  He even wrote in his books that he likes signing his own checks because he likes to pay close
*  attention to them.
*  And Madeline Westerhout, who was an executive assistant to Trump at the White House, has
*  also testified that Trump dealt with his personal finances even from the Oval Office.
*  So even as Blanche is working on that second pillar, the jurors may be thinking to themselves,
*  hmm, this doesn't quite match what I've heard in this trial so far.
*  Interesting.
*  Then he moves on to the third and final pillar, and this is his comfort zone.
*  Attacking Michael Cohen is where Todd Blanche likes to live.
*  The jurors have heard him do that throughout the trial, and they're going to hear him do
*  it again.
*  He tells them they can't trust Michael Cohen, that he's lied in the past, and then there's
*  this one phone call that they say Cohen has lied about that they really heart-bond.
*  Cohen says that he called Trump on October 24th through the phone of Trump's bodyguard,
*  Keith Schiller, and on that call, Cohen has testified, he told Trump that he had dealt
*  with some arrangement related to the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels.
*  But the defense has already tried to convince the jury during testimony that Cohen was talking
*  to Schiller, not Trump, and that he was talking to Schiller not about the hush money payment,
*  but about being bullied by a teenager.
*  There was some 14-year-old harassing and prank calling Cohen, and he called Schiller to complain
*  about it.
*  Weird.
*  And so Cohen has claimed, no, no, no, I talked to them both, and Blanche has said, no, the
*  call was too short.
*  You're lying.
*  And he says that again in closing arguments.
*  He reminds the jurors of this sequence, and he says, Michael Cohen lied to you about talking
*  that evening through Keith Schiller's phone and committed perjury at this very trial.
*  And then he kind of veers into this sports metaphor world.
*  First he calls Cohen the MVP of liars.
*  That's the most valuable player of liars.
*  And apparently liking that line, he then introduces another one.
*  So a newer sports term than MVP is goat.
*  Greatest of all time, right.
*  Greatest of all time.
*  And so Blanche introduces that concept.
*  He says Tom Brady, for instance, is the goat, and he says Michael Cohen is the gloat.
*  He's the greatest liar of all time.
*  So Blanche here coins the phrase gloat and seems to be kind of gloating about it.
*  But it's really important that Todd Blanche do this, and there's a reason that he's attacking
*  Cohen all these different ways.
*  He's trying to use humor.
*  He's trying to use argument.
*  And the reason this is so important is something that Blanche just says straight out in the
*  middle of his closing argument.
*  He tells the jurors that they cannot convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable
*  doubt on the word of Michael Cohen.
*  Michael Cohen is the only witness who provided direct testimony that Trump had signed off
*  on disguising reimbursements to him as legal payments.
*  So without that evidence, the prosecution is in a bit of a tougher spot, and it behooves
*  the defense to drive home as hard as they can and to really bear down on Michael Cohen's
*  importance to the case.
*  Right.
*  I mean, they're literally saying if he's the gloat, if he's the greatest liar of all time,
*  then the prosecution has no case.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  So Jonah, how is this all landing with the jury, pillars one, two, and three?
*  Well, we had initially thought that those were going to be the tent poles of this argument.
*  Pillar one and pillar two, those seem to kind of slide away.
*  What we're left with is these attacks over and over again on Michael Cohen.
*  And so by the end of the defense's closing argument, the jurors are really left with
*  not the cohesive narrative from the defense that we might have expected that they would
*  provide in their closing argument, but with this single idea, you can't trust Michael
*  Cohen.
*  Right.
*  So that's a really interesting, rich, alternative story, which, as you said earlier, was the
*  opportunity the defense really had here.
*  Why do you think the defense didn't avail itself of the opportunity to tell such a story?
*  That's a really good question.
*  And I think it's a hard question to answer.
*  When I think about Todd Blanch and the job he has to do in this trial, I think about
*  these four points that he has to focus on every time he's in the courtroom.
*  There's the judge in front of him.
*  There's the jury to his right.
*  There's the prosecution, his opponents, a little closer to his right.
*  And then sitting right to his left is former president Donald Trump.
*  And as Todd Blanch tries to pivot between convincing the jurors, contesting the prosecution,
*  appeasing the judge, and making sure that his client, notoriously difficult client,
*  Donald Trump is happy, I think it's possible that he might just be hamstringing himself.
*  Because one argument works for Trump, but it doesn't work for the jury.
*  Or one argument can test the prosecution really well, but the judge wants nothing to do with
*  it.
*  It's really hard to kind of navigate these four points.
*  It's not even triangulate.
*  It's quadrangulate or something like that.
*  That's maybe to me why Blanch doesn't really have this coherent narrative.
*  Instead, he settles on something that for him seems to solve all four problems.
*  The judge will let him attack Cohen.
*  Trump loves when he attacks Cohen.
*  The prosecution is angry when he attacks Cohen because he is a key witness for them.
*  And hopefully, Blanch thinks, the jury will be convinced by these attacks on Cohen.
*  But Michael Cohen is just one witness.
*  And the problem with focusing on him, with having this kind of one line argument, Michael
*  Cohen is a liar and you can't trust him, is that when the prosecutors are about to tell
*  this long story that they're going to back up with tons of documentary evidence and tons
*  of testimony that didn't come from Michael Cohen, will that single attack on Michael
*  Cohen, will that stick in jurors' heads and produce a reasonable doubt that the defense
*  needs to do everything it can to get.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Jonah, you just said that the thinness of the defense's argument relying so much on
*  Michael Cohen's ferocity left it vulnerable to a strong closing argument from the prosecution.
*  What was that closing?
*  The prosecution, namely Joshua Stein glass, the prosecutor is going to deliver this closing
*  And what he essentially tells the jury is, you don't have to rely on Michael Cohen.
*  We have 19 other witnesses.
*  And these are not random people we summoned off the street.
*  These are people who are in Trump's orbit.
*  Many of them are still loyal to Donald Trump.
*  And yet bit by bit, piece by piece, they also offer testimony that is really damning to
*  Donald Trump.
*  So one witness that he really sticks with for a long time is David Pecker, who in 2015
*  is the publisher of the National Enquirer.
*  And you'll remember as one member of what prosecutors say was a conspiracy to suppress
*  negative stories about Trump during the election that involved Trump, Cohen and David Pecker.
*  So David Pecker, he says, clearly implicates Trump.
*  In fact, David Pecker says that he had multiple conversations with Trump.
*  And there was at least one of those conversations in which Trump just acknowledges having known
*  about this scheme to pay hush money to people who had damaging stories.
*  So David Pecker is a great witness for prosecutors to identify and say, ignore Cohen.
*  Look at this guy.
*  Another witness that prosecutors gesture at, you know, don't look at Michael Cohen, look
*  at this other witness over here, is Hope Hicks.
*  Hope Hicks was Trump's campaign spokeswoman and later a spokeswoman for him when he was
*  in the White House.
*  And there's a couple of pieces of Hicks testimony that they draw on.
*  Now Hicks is still loyal to Trump.
*  She teared up on the stand.
*  And yet, prosecutors say she still gave damning evidence against her former boss.
*  So one thing that she testifies about is Trump having told her at one point that it's a good
*  thing that the news of the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels did not come out during
*  the 2016 election.
*  Now this is kind of gold for the prosecution because the defense has tried to argue, oh,
*  Trump may have wanted to hide the Stormy Daniels story.
*  But if he did, it was just to protect his family.
*  But Joshua Steinblast, the prosecutor, says that by saying to Hope Hicks that he's happy
*  that it at least did not come out during the election, Trump is making his motivation plain
*  and reinforcing what prosecutors say was his reason for entering that conspiracy with David
*  Pecker and Michael Cohen in the first place.
*  This would seem to do a lot of work to say to the jury, you don't have to rely on Michael
*  Cohen.
*  But as we've established throughout the coverage of this trial with you, Jonah, Cohen is very
*  important to the prosecution.
*  So how does the prosecution rebut the idea that the defense has said in its closing that
*  you simply cannot trust anything Cohen has said?
*  Well, I think the best illustration of it actually has to do with that phone call that
*  Michael Cohen placed to Keith Schiller to talk to Donald Trump about arranging some
*  detail of the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels.
*  Right, which was too short, the defense said, to have actually happened.
*  Right.
*  That he talked to Schiller about the kid bullying him, and then he also talked to Trump.
*  And the defense says, yeah, there's no way that happened.
*  But the prosecutor, Joshua Stein glass, he doesn't just argue against that.
*  What he does is he takes a cell phone and he hits the timer on that cell phone so that
*  the stopwatch is running.
*  And then he pretends to be Michael Cohen.
*  And he pretends to call Keith Schiller.
*  And then with plenty of silences, with plenty of pauses, asks Keith Schiller to hand the
*  phone to Trump.
*  And Joshua Stein glass playing Michael Cohen tells Trump that he has dealt with this hush
*  money arrangement that Cohen says that he had dealt with.
*  And then finally, Stein glass is done.
*  He hangs up the phone and he stops the stopwatch.
*  And somewhere around like 45 seconds.
*  And the records for the phone call that Cohen had with Schiller are almost twice as long
*  as what Stein glass has just done.
*  So what Stein glass has clearly just shown the jury is there was plenty of time for Michael
*  Cohen to have called Trump's bodyguard, had a weird conversation about a pranking 14 year
*  old, and then also gotten Trump on the line to talk about paying off Stormy Daniels.
*  In fact, it seems like there was still time to spare.
*  So this is a very clever and theatrical way of contravening what the defense has said
*  about this call.
*  Yeah, he doesn't just argue it.
*  He shows it and he shows it in this memorable, funny way that I think could really help to
*  dismantle what the defense has clearly seen as one of its best arguments.
*  Everything you're describing so far sounds like the prosecution being pretty responsive
*  to the defense closing argument.
*  How if at all is the prosecution selling its own story and its own testimony that it gathered
*  during this trial?
*  What they do is they just put together this very structured, very organized timeline that
*  Joshua Stein glass is talking about as he's making this closing argument.
*  And so he proceeds from August 2015, when prosecutors say the conspiracy was formed
*  into 2016, October 2016, when the hush money payment to Daniels was made.
*  And in that October section in particular, he slows way down.
*  And we just see reams of documentary evidence, phone calls between all the main players,
*  Trump, Pecker, Michael Cohen, Keith Davidson, who was Stormy Daniels' lawyer at the time,
*  Dylan Howard, who was an editor at the National Enquirer.
*  Not only are we seeing these people talking to each other, but we're seeing events play
*  out in real time.
*  So something happens in the campaign, for instance, the Access Hollywood tape gets released.
*  This is a problem for the Trump campaign.
*  And suddenly Stormy Daniels' story, another potential sex scandal in waiting, is a lot
*  more urgent for them to deal with.
*  And so as Joshua Stein glass is telling us about this, all of which took place in October
*  2016, we're seeing all the related phone calls between those key players as Cohen realizes
*  he has to deal with the story.
*  And he starts contacting Keith Davidson, and he starts contacting Donald Trump.
*  Everything that Joshua Stein glass is arguing here is not just relying on Cohen's testimony.
*  Cohen's testimony is this one strand of a really intricate, colorful, detail packed
*  sequence that the prosecutors lay out sometimes could feel almost overwhelming.
*  And I just want to make sure that I'm highlighting the contrast here because it was really stark
*  in the courtroom.
*  Todd Blanch tried to structure his argument in a somewhat similar way with those three
*  pillars, but his argument soon melted into this, that, and the other thing.
*  The prosecution's argument is really structured.
*  They're scaffolding throughout it.
*  And so when you try and remember a certain piece of evidence, it makes it easier to remember
*  where each detail is kept.
*  You know where the Stormy Daniels' payment is because it's at the end of that long sequence
*  in October.
*  You know when the election was November 8th, 2016.
*  All those things are anchored in time in the prosecution's argument.
*  And so when the jury begins to deliberate, they'll be able to refer back to that timeline
*  as they seek to bring up and discuss these all important points of the case.
*  But when they refer back to the defense closing, other than Michael Cohen is a liar, it's not
*  really clear what they remember.
*  What you're clearly saying here is prosecution was telling a better, more coherent, more
*  compelling story than the defense.
*  But I'm curious, as you're in the courtroom listening to the prosecution, which gets the
*  last word with its closing, how they're signaling to the jury that this is a case worth convicting
*  a former president and current Republican nominee for president of having committed.
*  Because that seems like a somewhat different kettle of fish than simply referring to a
*  bunch of evidence.
*  Well, this is the reason we're talking about this case, right?
*  It's significant not because it's a random defendant in New York charged with 34 counts
*  of falsifying business records, but because it's Donald Trump.
*  And prosecutors aren't just arguing that he falsified records.
*  They're arguing that he did so to cover up an election conspiracy in which he defrauded
*  the American people by keeping the truth about his candidacy from them.
*  And Joshua Steinglas draws on that here.
*  He says that after the Access Hollywood tape was released, the campaign between Trump and
*  Hillary Clinton was extremely close.
*  He even plays video of Trump talking about how he needs every last percentage point he
*  can get because the race is so close.
*  And what Steinglas says is, we can't ever know whether the publication of Stormy Daniels's
*  story would have swung the election.
*  But regardless, Americans in 2016 deserve to know, they deserve to know this thing that
*  Donald Trump, prosecutors say, intentionally hid from them, intentionally suppressed this.
*  In doing so, he really robbed Americans of our right to evaluate candidates as fully
*  as we can, the prosecutors are arguing here.
*  So given everything that you've just laid out, I want to now and finally turn to the
*  jury's deliberations, which are about to get underway.
*  You are, of course, a reporter.
*  You're not a juror, but you sat in this courtroom for the entirety of the trial.
*  You didn't miss a moment of it.
*  So I'm curious how you're thinking about what those deliberations are likely to kind of
*  look like.
*  The jurors have a lot to discuss.
*  I really keep thinking over and over about what it's going to be like for them because
*  the jury is barred from discussing the case until this exact moment, until they're actually
*  given the chance to deliberate it.
*  So these people have been hanging out with each other for weeks, seeing the same stuff,
*  making small talk.
*  But never comparing notes about what they actually make of the testimony.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  So now they get to talk for the first time.
*  They will deliberate.
*  It can take hours.
*  It can take days.
*  It can take weeks.
*  Now, there are 34 charges here and there are three options really for each charge.
*  The jurors can find Trump guilty.
*  They can find him not guilty and they could just not come to an agreement at all and hang
*  on the charge.
*  And so if we hear a verdict, it could be guilty on all 34 counts.
*  It could be not guilty on all 34 counts.
*  It could be some combination, what's called a mixed verdict, where Trump is found guilty
*  on some of the counts, but not others.
*  And it also could be that even though we've said that the prosecution's case has come
*  in really strong, there's one juror who really doesn't trust Michael Cohen and really agrees
*  and believes that the case hinges on Cohen.
*  And that juror, if they decide, I can't find this guy guilty on any one of these charges
*  because I have to rely on Cohen to do so, then there's no chance of getting any convictions
*  on any one of the charges.
*  Because all the jurors, and this is the key point, all the jurors have to agree.
*  They have to be unanimous.
*  And so what you have at the end of this trial that is about defrauding the American people,
*  according to prosecutors, is this chance for 12 people in a room to come together, talk,
*  and try to decide whether the first former American president ever to go on trial is
*  guilty or not.
*  Well, Jonah, as always, thank you very much.
*  Thanks so much for having me.
*  The trial is expected to resume at 10 a.m. this morning, when the judge will issue instructions
*  to the jury.
*  After that, jury deliberations will officially begin.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Tuesday, the White House said that the Israeli strike that killed dozens of Palestinian
*  civilians in Rafah did not violate President Biden's recent threat to cut off arms shipments
*  to Israel if it carried out a major military operation in the city.
*  How does this not violate the red line the president laid out?
*  As I said, we don't want to see a major ground operation.
*  We haven't seen that at this point.
*  During a news conference, reporters pushed a White House spokesman, John Kirby, to explain
*  the president's thinking.
*  How many more charred corpses does he have to see before the president considers a change
*  in policy?
*  We don't want to see a single more innocent life taken.
*  And I kind of take a little offense at the question.
*  No civilian casualties is the right number of civilian casualties.
*  And Democratic Party leaders say they will nominate President Biden for a second term
*  office via a virtual roll call of delegates in order to avoid an Ohio law that has threatened
*  to keep Biden off the state's ballot in November.
*  Ohio law requires that all candidates be legally certified by August 7th, but Biden is not
*  scheduled to be officially nominated until weeks later during the Democratic National
*  Convention.
*  The virtual roll call solves that problem because it will be completed before the Ohio
*  deadline.
