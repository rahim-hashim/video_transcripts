# Ron DeSantisâ€™s Rise From Unknown to Heir Apparent
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du2aClhkhe0)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is a daily.
*  As the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination gets underway, I'm Nikki Haley
*  and I'm running for president.
*  A single figure has so far emerged as a true rival to Donald Trump.
*  I love DeSantis.
*  Fantastic job.
*  I love the guy.
*  Donald Trump's my president and DeSantis will be my next president.
*  Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida.
*  DeSantis leading Trump by double digits, 14 points.
*  He also hasn't even announced he may not...
*  Who poll show has broken away from the pack by turning his state into a laboratory for
*  a post-Trump version of conservatism.
*  Has the apprentice now become the master of the conservative party?
*  That's the question.
*  Now, as DeSantis takes his first steps towards announcing a possible candidacy, including
*  a high profile tour of early voting states and the release of a book about his vision
*  for the country, my colleague, Patty Mazzei, tells the story of his rapid and unlikely
*  rise to Republican stardom and his potential path to the nomination.
*  It's Tuesday, March 7th.
*  Patty, you have lived in Florida for years now and you've really had a front row view
*  of Ron DeSantis' career, which is why we want to talk to you about how it is that he
*  has become such a powerful force in the Republican Party and in this emerging 2024 race to become
*  the party's presidential nominee, despite not even being an announced candidate.
*  So where in your mind does that story start?
*  So Ron DeSantis was born in Jacksonville, Florida, and grew up outside of Tampa.
*  His mother was a nurse.
*  His dad installed TV ratings boxes for Nielsen and he played baseball, which eventually took
*  him to Yale, where he also played baseball, and later to Harvard Law School.
*  And after graduating from Harvard, he became a lawyer for the U.S. Navy.
*  So that was his sterling resume when he was elected to Congress in 2012 from a district
*  in northeast Florida.
*  And he was a sort of low profile classic Tea Party Republican who ran on cutting spending
*  and shrinking the size of the federal government.
*  And when he was in Congress, he was known for being a guy without many friends, sort
*  of aloof, prickly, walking around with headphones on his ears so he didn't have to chat with
*  people.
*  Right.
*  I mean, I remember being a political reporter in this era and not really ever hearing his
*  name.
*  So here you have a kind of Tea Party backbencher at the birth of that movement, not especially
*  memorable or impactful on the party.
*  Right.
*  But even then, he had a bit of a provocative style.
*  President Obama, as you might recall, had written a bestselling book about his family
*  called Dreams from My Father.
*  Well, DeSantis wrote a sort of retort to it, and he made the case against Obama's policies
*  and titled it Dreams from Our Founding Fathers.
*  Hmm.
*  A book designed to troll the Democratic president.
*  Yes.
*  But he really doesn't arrive on the national scene until 2018 when he decides to run for
*  governor of Florida.
*  And he's not the Republican establishment favorite.
*  Everyone knows my husband, Ron DeSantis, is endorsed by President Trump, but he's also
*  an amazing dad.
*  Ron loves playing with the kids.
*  So he introduces himself to the state with this ad that becomes instantly memorable,
*  narrated by his wife that talks about how her husband plays with their children.
*  Build the wall.
*  And the way he does that in this ad is by building a wall with toy blocks.
*  Then Mr. Trump said, you're fired.
*  I love that part.
*  And reading a bedtime story that is Donald Trump's art of the deal.
*  People say Ron's all Trump, but he is so much more.
*  Right.
*  I love this ad.
*  And what's interesting about it is that it's not just an ode to Donald Trump, who was president
*  at the time head of the Republican Party.
*  It simultaneously pokes fun at the very idea of having to make an ode to Donald Trump.
*  Right.
*  It acknowledges how much a Republican at the time needed to tether himself to Trump, but
*  also is kind of in on the joke.
*  And he really strongly pursues Trump's explicit endorsement and he gets it.
*  And that endorsement catapults DeSantis to winning the Republican primary and then to
*  winning the general election by less than one percentage point.
*  And he becomes governor just by the slimmest of margins.
*  And of course, being a Republican governor in the era of Donald Trump means to some degree,
*  accepting that he is the big story and the big figure in the party.
*  So as governor, how does DeSantis end up carving out a space in the spotlight of his own and
*  ultimately become a rival to Trump?
*  It really all starts with the coronavirus pandemic.
*  At first, DeSantis really hesitates to lock down the state.
*  He has this instinct against it, but wants to do what the federal government at the time
*  run by President Trump is urging states to do.
*  And so he does in April of 2020 issue a stay at home order.
*  However, he quickly starts looking for a way to reopen the state.
*  By May, the stay at home orders start to expire and he's telling people they should start
*  going about their normal lives again.
*  We're going to be safe, smart, and we're going to do this step by step.
*  And by the fall, he forces schools to reopen by sort of threatening school funding.
*  Our kids are at the least risk from this virus.
*  Yet it is our kids who have borne the harshest burden of the control measures instituted
*  to protect against the virus.
*  But he doesn't just say the schools need to reopen.
*  He goes further.
*  I'm opposed to mandates, period.
*  I don't think they work.
*  He bans mask mandates.
*  People in Florida wear them when you go out.
*  I mean, they don't have to be strung up by a bayonet to do it.
*  He tells businesses that they can't require people to be vaccinated to come to their shops,
*  to their restaurants.
*  You can't burn down the village in order to save it.
*  You can't kneecap your own society and think you're going to successfully handle a pandemic.
*  And so there's really no alternative left for businesses and institutions but to reopen
*  and to do so with relatively loose COVID policies.
*  Right.
*  So he's using the power of the governorship to basically make it impossible to do anything
*  other than fully reopen.
*  He's taken all the available systematic precautions and basically made them illegal.
*  Yes.
*  And he's incredibly vocal about it at every step.
*  The lie of the lockdown was if you just lock down, then you can beat the virus.
*  Well, why are people having the lockdown two or three times then?
*  He juxtaposes himself with blue state governors all the time.
*  I mean, just look at New York.
*  If your positivity is above whatever arbitrary thing, you have to close the school.
*  Really?
*  Comparing himself to New York, California.
*  In the state of Florida, we probably are the most open big state in the country.
*  He realizes that there is a lot of anger towards those policies and begins to capitalize
*  on that.
*  So some of this stuff I think is petty tyranny.
*  I think it's been a huge mistake.
*  So he starts becoming the figure that represents anger chafing opposition to a lot of the more
*  restrictive COVID policies from 2020.
*  What's interesting about this moment, and I remember it really well, is how it made
*  DeSantis a kind of hero to those who wanted to break free from these pandemic restrictions,
*  even though it was President Trump who by this point was calling for the nation's governors
*  to end the lockdowns.
*  But Trump, despite his own skepticism of the COVID rules, was in this tricky position because
*  he's still the face of that original federal response to the pandemic, which is lockdowns.
*  So for many, DeSantis becomes a kind of pure version of anti-lockdown leadership.
*  I think that's true, that Trump couldn't really be in the position of both defending his administration's
*  policies and advice and then countering them.
*  But DeSantis could be.
*  And that helps him build this persona of trying to go back to what he believes is common sense,
*  put our kids in school, let people go back to work.
*  And Patty, when it comes to the pandemic, is it possible to say whether or not this
*  approach he took worked?
*  I think DeSantis gambled that people would hold their government officials accountable
*  more for policies like lockdowns than they would for deaths caused by a global pandemic.
*  More than 86,000 Floridians have died from the coronavirus.
*  But in the end, public opinion polling and election results show that people rewarded
*  DeSantis for the policies that he endorsed to reopen the economy.
*  And what's the lesson that you think DeSantis took from this pandemic?
*  He seemed to have learned that if you came off as a fighter who was always on the offense
*  picking fights against the overarching liberal elite, that you would be rewarded, that that
*  would pay off, that you would get national attention and popularity from your base, from
*  the right, and that it could only help you to do more of that rather than less.
*  So where does he start to do more of that?
*  He starts picking new fights unrelated to the pandemic.
*  And the biggest one, the one that probably got the most attention in Florida and the
*  rest of the country, is against one of the states and the country's most beloved companies.
*  Disney.
*  And remind us what he does with Disney.
*  Well, in early 2022, we are taking a deeper dive into a proposed law that is dividing
*  parents here in Florida.
*  A bill starts going through the Florida legislature that restricts the way sexual orientation
*  and gender identity can be taught in schools.
*  It would ban schools from teaching about sexual orientation or gender identity to younger
*  students between kindergarten and third grade.
*  And opponents nicknamed this legislation, which is formally called Parental Rights in
*  Education, the Don't Say Gay Bill.
*  We say gay!
*  We say gay!
*  They start trying to rally public opinion against it, including among businesses.
*  Dozens of Disney employees walked off the job, an act of protest over Florida's so-called
*  Don't Say Gay Bill.
*  And eventually, word comes out that Disney opposes the bill.
*  Which is a big deal because Disney, as you just indicated, is a major player and employer
*  in Florida.
*  In Florida politics, Disney has usually gotten what it wants.
*  But in this case, DeSantis criticizes Disney.
*  You know, when we were young, you could watch cartoons without having to worry.
*  Now parents have to sit there and worry about what are they trying to inject in?
*  What type of ideology are they trying to pursue?
*  And that is wrong.
*  Which is sort of unheard of in Republican political circles in this state, especially
*  for the governor, to pick a sort of high-profile fight with a company that has just been such
*  a big player.
*  Right.
*  And whose emblem is Mickey Mouse?
*  Who picks a fight with Mickey Mouse?
*  Nobody.
*  Until now.
*  But the reason you see things like these, these kerfluffles, is because of something
*  that is effectively a woke mind virus that's getting involved into all these institutions.
*  He says that the government, or that his administration anyway, is not going to fall
*  victim to what he describes as a woke ideology.
*  I'm supporting it.
*  I mean, I'm going to do what's right for the people of Florida.
*  I don't take marching orders from woke corporations based in California.
*  That's not how I roll.
*  And he even goes as far as to threaten Disney's bottom line.
*  So they're free to take these positions, but they are not free to force us to subsidize
*  their activism.
*  And they've been getting massive subsidies from Florida since before I was born.
*  All because Disney had the temerity to oppose this bill about talking about sexuality in
*  schools.
*  Yeah.
*  And it worked.
*  Surrounded by young students at a Pasco County charter school, Governor Ron DeSantis signed
*  the Parental Rights in Education Bill.
*  He signed the Parental Rights in Education Bill after it was passed by the state legislature.
*  And then he also signed another bill that did in fact target Disney.
*  The company will now be under the control of a state board and has been ordered to pay
*  back $700 million in debt and taxes.
*  Today the corporate kingdom finally comes to an end.
*  People started praising DeSantis and siding with DeSantis for taking on Disney.
*  And he becomes this culture warrior who can now go around the state and the country saying
*  we took on the biggest corporation in the state.
*  We can take on any other corporation, any other institution, any other elite that comes
*  our way.
*  Beware.
*  There's a new sheriff in town and accountability will be the order of the day.
*  And of course, as this Disney fight is playing out and DeSantis is reaping the political
*  dividends from it on the right, something else is happening, which is that Donald Trump's
*  star is rapidly fading, mostly over January 6th and all these damning revelations that
*  have come out of the hearings of a January 6th committee about his decision making, all
*  of which start to cast real doubt on Trump's appeal and really his hold over the Republican
*  Party.
*  The 2022 midterm election becomes a public test for both Trump and DeSantis.
*  Trump is campaigning for candidates who support his election denialism while dealing with
*  the January 6th investigation.
*  DeSantis is campaigning for his fellow Republicans, but not talking about election denialism.
*  He says the elections in Florida are properly run.
*  He still opens an office of election crimes to investigate potential fraud, but he is
*  really running on these fights that he has taken on in the state and won and that his
*  political base really likes.
*  Right.
*  Pandemic, Disney.
*  Right.
*  And on election day, he wins in a landslide.
*  He wins by 19 percentage points in a state where recent elections have been decided by
*  maybe one or two percentage points.
*  Hmm.
*  So a very different situation than four years earlier in 2018 when DeSantis barely squeaked
*  out a victory.
*  This time, he's clearly won over a lot more voters with this elbows out aggressive approach.
*  That's right.
*  And meanwhile, Trump has one of the worst days that he has politically because his candidates
*  do horribly elsewhere in the country.
*  Their paths sort of cross in opposite directions.
*  Trump is starting to look weaker and DeSantis is starting to look stronger.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Patty, as Trump's fortunes are falling, what does DeSantis do with this landslide
*  victory he has in Florida?
*  DeSantis is now emboldened.
*  He has super majorities in both chambers of the state legislature.
*  He's got the support of local officials all the way down to school board members that
*  he has helped get elected.
*  And so he unleashes his playbook and is putting it into overdrive.
*  Florida is where woe goes to die.
*  In just weeks into his second term, the administration has a new target.
*  Just over the past few weeks, we've seen how he has attacked New College, which is a public
*  liberal arts institution in Sarasota.
*  Governor Ron DeSantis recently replaced six of the board's 13 members and in an apparent
*  bid to transform this intimate 700 person liberal arts college.
*  He and his allies want to turn into a beacon of conservatism as a fight against liberal
*  academia.
*  So the mission has been, I think, more into the DEI, CRT, the gender ideology, rather
*  than what a liberal arts education should be.
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is defending his administration's decision to block a
*  course on African-American studies from the state's public schools.
*  He has rejected an advanced placement African-American studies course for high schoolers.
*  Who would say that an important part of black history is queer theory?
*  That is somebody pushing an agenda on our kids.
*  It's our view in Florida that we want to be standing up for the little guy against some
*  of these massive media conglomerates.
*  He has convened a roundtable looking like he's a cable news anchor where he has talked
*  about how the news media has way too much power and it has to be easier to sue them
*  for libel and defamation.
*  And I have only begun to fight.
*  So time after time we are seeing him announce, endorse, propose policies that the legislature
*  can pass in the coming weeks and add to his list of fights and victories that then he
*  can campaign on.
*  And all that's just in the past few weeks, you're saying.
*  It makes it hard to keep up.
*  So in each of these cases the common theme here of a line of attack is that liberal elites
*  have infiltrated an institution and he is going to be the savior who swoops in and stops
*  them.
*  It almost doesn't really matter whether the facts he's claiming are true.
*  He's very compellingly to those on the right making the case that he has ferreted out a
*  problem that must be solved.
*  Right.
*  He's again seizing on this anger that people have and maybe used to have sort of privately
*  about how far some institutions have gone in changing.
*  And so he's capitalizing on that.
*  And of course everything about this feels Trumpian, but Trump is no longer in office.
*  No, Trump is a resident of Florida, but he spends most of his time at Mar-a-Lago where
*  he's dealing with multiple lawsuits and scandals.
*  And DeSantis is the one getting the attention.
*  And from the best we can tell, upsetting Trump that he is doing so.
*  Well explain that.
*  Well, what our colleagues have reported is that Trump sees DeSantis as a very clear threat
*  as somebody who could potentially challenge him in a Republican primary.
*  And so he has taken to publicly calling him Ron DeSantimonious and we understand privately
*  calling him Meatball Ron.
*  And DeSantis so far has managed to not take the bait and said that he doesn't spend his
*  time smearing or taking pot shots at other Republicans.
*  But there's no sure sign that Donald Trump feels threatened or rivaled by somebody than
*  when he gives that person a nasty nickname.
*  And if he's given Ron DeSantis multiple nasty nicknames, then you know he's feeling threatened.
*  Exactly.
*  And DeSantis is doing nothing to dissuade the idea that he might be interested in running
*  for president.
*  In fact, he's making overt gestures that suggest that he is interested in running for president.
*  He has been taking trips to other states, states that are important in presidential
*  elections, Pennsylvania, New York.
*  He has put out a new book.
*  He has welcomed political donors, and tell me if this sounds familiar, to a hotel in
*  Palm Beach to talk about his politics.
*  So these are all the moves of a person who is testing the waters for a potential national
*  campaign.
*  And these are definitely the moves of someone who once needed Trump, right?
*  He's interested in so much that he featured himself reading from Trump's book to introduce
*  himself to Florida, clearly now asserting his independence from Trump.
*  And so in thinking about the totality of what we've covered here, right, and what DeSantis
*  now represents if and when he enters that primary, what portrait of leadership do you
*  think Ron DeSantis, the Republican presidential candidate, is going to be offering the party?
*  He has positioned himself to campaign as Trump without Trump's baggage.
*  Trumpism that gets things done but doesn't have scandal and drama.
*  And he's also just a whole lot younger than Trump at 44.
*  So he's a fighter from the next generation that can fight for the people who are angry
*  about where society is going and knows how to get stuff passed, knows how to use power
*  to do so.
*  But that style of leadership means that you don't hear from opponents.
*  It means that people who don't serve your purpose are often ignored or crushed or crushed.
*  It definitely sends a chilling effect.
*  You lead by dividing and pitting groups against each other, in many cases by going after people
*  who are vulnerable.
*  And so there's a real downside that critics point to, to how DeSantis has governed to
*  the people who are not in his favor, who do not agree with him, having no say in what
*  is happening in the state.
*  But if you are a Republican and you like what DeSantis is doing in Florida, he has created
*  a laboratory for challenging liberalism, for putting into effect right-wing policies.
*  And that is what he appears to be using as a potential national platform to run for president.
*  But the question is, is that enough?
*  The fact that he doesn't have Trump's personality is what some people think could be DeSantis'
*  weakness.
*  Explain that.
*  He doesn't have Trump's charisma.
*  He has not been tested at the national stage.
*  And he doesn't really relish firing up crowds.
*  And that's how Donald Trump won the Republican primary in 2016.
*  So can Ron DeSantis do that without those skills?
*  Right, it's one thing to fight Disney or fight COVID restrictions.
*  But if DeSantis runs, he will be up against the man who literally wrote the playbook from
*  which DeSantis has been borrowing.
*  Yeah, DeSantis has been perfecting a version of Trumpism in Florida.
*  But if he runs for president, he's going to actually have to face Trump himself.
*  And that I think is a much harder political fight than DeSantis has faced before.
*  Well, Patty, thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  Later today, the Florida legislature will reconvene for its latest session, during which
*  its Republican majorities are expected to pass several high-profile bills backed by
*  Governor DeSantis that target the political left.
*  One of them is a higher education bill that would ban gender studies majors, prohibit
*  public colleges and universities from spending money on programs espousing diversity, equity
*  and inclusion and make it easier to push out tenured faculty members.
*  People look at Florida, they're like, man, the governor's gotten a lot done and we have
*  more proud of it.
*  You ain't seen nothing yet.
*  This is going to be the most productive legislative session we have had across the board.
*  And I think people are going to be really excited.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to nerday.
*  On Monday, Norfolk Southern, which operates the freight train that derailed in East Palestine,
*  Ohio, said it would install about 200 heat detectors on its rail network in order to
*  detect the kind of overheating wheel bearing that contributed to the accident.
*  The technology will be added wherever the distance between existing detectors is more
*  than 15 miles, including the approach to East Palestine, where there's a 19-mile gap between
*  detectors.
*  The announcement comes just days before Norfolk Southern's CEO is scheduled to testify before
*  Congress about the company's safety record.
*  And the Biden administration is considering whether to carry out a mass vaccination of
*  chickens in an effort to stop an outbreak of avian influenza that has already killed
*  tens of millions of birds and as a result, driven up the cost of eggs.
*  The bird flu outbreak, which began last year, is the biggest in U.S.
*  history, affecting more than 58 million birds in 47 states.
