*  The tallest dam in the US sits above a place called Oraville, a town of about 20,000
*  people in northern California.
*  In 2017, the dam at Oraville started to come apart.
*  Heavy rains sent millions of gallons of water down its concrete spillway.
*  The flow found a weak spot and small cracks soon became giant holes.
*  The surface of concrete started tumbling down the hillside.
*  This particular dam is 770 feet tall.
*  If it failed, it could send a wall of water 300 feet high toward the valley below, wiping
*  out the town.
*  My name is Christopher Cox and I'm a contributor to the New York Times magazine.
*  This week's Sunday read is a story I wrote about the dams of California and the risks
*  they face from extreme weather.
*  California has always been subject to cycles of extreme drought followed by incredibly
*  wet years.
*  The state's dams were built in part to take that erratic weather and tame it, to store
*  a water from the wet years and parcel it out over the dry ones.
*  It's that system that allowed California to become the agricultural powerhouse of the
*  country.
*  The dam that people in this country are probably most familiar with is the Hoover Dam.
*  It's an arch dam, a big sweep of concrete wedged into a canyon.
*  There were some of those arch dams in California, but there are a whole lot more of a different
*  kind called an embankment dam.
*  These usually have a core made of clay and are covered with earth and rocks.
*  The upside to these dams is that they stand up well to earthquakes.
*  The downside is that if even just a little bit of water starts to flow over the top of
*  it, it's incredibly dangerous.
*  This is called overtopping and an overtopped embankment dam can wash away like a sandcastle.
*  That's the scenario Auroville faced in 2017.
*  Many of California's dams share a fatal flaw.
*  They were designed and built using flood data from the middle of the last century, and
*  unusually calm period in the state's weather.
*  So some of the biggest floods in the history of the west coast weren't included.
*  And of course, the possibility of a warming atmosphere wasn't factored in at all.
*  As one scientist told me, all of this infrastructure is designed for a climate that no longer exists.
*  After the Auroville crisis, I heard from experts who said that other dams were at risk.
*  It was then that I began investigating.
*  What would happen if an even bigger series of storms hit the state?
*  As you'll hear, it proved to be a trickier question to answer than I ever would have imagined.
*  We need to prepare.
*  Future storms will bring unprecedented destruction.
*  And the type of flooding brought by a dam failure, a wave of water taller than a tsunami, will be devastating.
*  Will California be ready?
*  So here's my article, The Trillion Galen Question, read by Robert Petkov.
*  The Trillion Galen Question.
*  What if California's dams fail?
*  Published in the New York Times magazine, written by Christopher Cox.
*  On the morning of February 7, 2017, two electricians were working on a warning siren near the spillway of Auroville dam,
*  60 miles north of Sacramento, when they heard an explosion.
*  As they watched, a giant plume of water rose over their heads, and chunks of concrete began flying down the hillside toward the feather river.
*  The dam's spillway, a concrete channel capable of moving millions of gallons of water out of the reservoir in seconds,
*  was disintegrating in front of them.
*  If it had to be taken out of service, a serious rainstorm, like the one that had been falling on Northern California for days,
*  could cause the dam, the tallest in the United States, to fail.
*  Corey Hony, the sheriff of Butte County, which includes the dam and the town it is named for,
*  first heard that something was wrong from Dino Corbin, a local radio personality who called him at his office.
*  Are you aware there's a hole in the spillway?
*  Around the same time, one of the sheriff's dispatchers received a confusing message from California's department of water resources,
*  which owns the dam, saying it was conducting a routine inspection after reports of an incident.
*  I don't believe anyone at DWR was intentionally keeping information from me.
*  Hony told me, they were a siloed organization steeped in bureaucracy.
*  They weren't good at communicating externally.
*  Hony sent his under sheriff up to the dam headquarters to figure out what was going on.
*  At the dam, DWR officials closed the gates at the top of the spillway to prevent any more of its concrete slabs from being lost
*  in what an independent forensic report prepared after the incident described as,
*  a sudden, explosive failure.
*  The flow of water stopped.
*  The rain, however, didn't.
*  On February 8th, Hony drove up to the dam from Oravill, a gold rush town that was set out on a grid along the feather.
*  Nearly 20,000 people lived there, all of them downstream of the dam.
*  At certain points during the drive, Hony would have been able to glimpse it.
*  770 feet high and nearly 7,000 feet wide at its crest, a grey wedge jammed between two hills.
*  Oravill is an Earth-fill embankment dam with a clay core and a surface of loosely placed rocks.
*  These structures can be incredibly resilient, especially to earthquakes, concrete dams like Hoover Dam are rare in seismically active California,
*  but they are also more vulnerable if over-topped.
*  Once water overwhelms the spillway and starts flowing over an embankment dam, its layers can melt away at an astonishing speed.
*  If Oravill failed in this way, it would send a wave more than 185 feet tall sweeping into the valley below.
*  At the dam's operations and maintenance center, DWR had set up a command post in the main conference room.
*  The room was about the size of a squash court with a giant table in the middle, but still they needed a tent in the parking lot to accommodate everyone.
*  Engineers, geologists, DWR executives, federal officials, fire and rescue.
*  They were all in the conference room plotting erosion patterns not thinking the sheriff's office might like to know what they're up to.
*  Hony says, Scott Turnquist and Engineer at the Dam describes a situation so chaotic they didn't even know if the site of the command center was safe from flooding if the dam failed.
*  We didn't have good inundation maps, he says, and so we are real time trying to generate those to understand whether we are at risk.
*  For days, the group in the conference room tried to figure out how to stop Lake Oravill from rising despite the steady rain.
*  They put the hobbled spillway back in service, but the stream dove into the hole and threw even more concrete into the air.
*  Eventually, nearly half the spillway was gone, and the erosion started creeping toward the top of the dam.
*  Oravill had a kind of safety valve to prevent overtopping, an emergency spillway next to the main spillway that could release vast quantities of water.
*  There wasn't much to this spillway, it was an unimproved slope covered with dirt and trees with a concrete lip called an OG Weir at the top.
*  The Weir was there to prevent the same kind of runaway erosion that would happen if water flowed over the dam itself.
*  In the 50 years since the dam was completed, the emergency spillway had never been used.
*  On the evening of February 10, DWR decided to reduce the outflow on the main spillway, effectively ensuring the emergency spillway would be used.
*  One representative from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had asked whether it was really the end of the world if they went an inch over the emergency spillway.
*  They would soon find out.
*  At around seven the next morning, water started flowing down the emergency spillway.
*  The geologists in the room had warned that the rock below the weir was unstable.
*  After a large section of it eroded suddenly, they started talking about the dangers of headcutting.
*  The possibility that the erosion would travel up the hill and undermine the concrete weir.
*  By 3.25 pm on February 12, the judgment in the command center was that within two to four hours the weir could topple over, sending a wall of water as high as 50 feet rushing toward town.
*  At 4.27 pm, Hony issued a mandatory evacuation order.
*  To establish the size of the evacuation zone, he pulled out a map and called over Bill Croil, the acting director of DWR.
*  Should it be this big? He asked, dropping his hands down on the map about two feet apart.
*  Maybe not that big, Croil said.
*  How about this? Hony asked. This time, keeping his hands about ten inches apart.
*  Croil had him move his hands a little bit wider.
*  As many as 180,000 people ended up having to leave their homes.
*  Hony called in law enforcement from throughout the region to help with the evacuation.
*  He recognized the gravity of calling all these officers into the inundation path.
*  I may not have a department tomorrow, he thought.
*  As the citizens of Oraville jammed the roads out of town, the Sheriff's Department started to evacuate the jail.
*  They had 578 inmates in custody, far more than could fit in buted counties, prison buses and vans,
*  so they commandeered anything that had wheels.
*  They saved their limited stockpile of handcuffs and waste chains for the most violent prisoners.
*  Even so, on one of the high security buses, the inmates tried to kick the door open.
*  The lower risk evacuees were put unshackled in regular school buses.
*  Eventually, the prisoners wound up in Alameda County in the Santa Rita jail where they stayed for days.
*  After the evacuation, the situation at the dam stabilized.
*  The rain led up and the main spillway, although badly damaged, was able to channel enough water out of the reservoir
*  to drop the level below the top of the emergency spillway.
*  Slowly, the townspeople returned to their homes.
*  Today, the dam has two new spillways, each of which survived major rains this spring with no problems.
*  According to Hony, though, the people of Oraville remain traumatized.
*  During a meeting with DWR officials in 2019, one resident worried about the next incident.
*  I think about a little baby.
*  They can't save themselves, she said.
*  We can't save ourselves if that dam breaks or if we have another one of these catastrophic events,
*  which I'm not sure we won't in my lifetime.
*  The Independent Forensic Report faulted an immature, significantly overconfident and complacent culture at DWR.
*  Officials ignored reports about the flawed rock below the emergency spillway,
*  made repairs in a haphazard way and failed to find flaws in the spillway design,
*  most notably drains that made the concrete more susceptible to cracking.
*  The report also noted that this attitude is typical among large dam owners.
*  The fact that this incident happened to the owner of the tallest dam in the United States
*  under regulation of a federal agency with repeated evaluation by reputable outside consultants
*  in a state with a leading dam safety regulatory program is a wake-up call for everyone involved in dam safety.
*  In the six years since Oraville, dam operators across the country have begun to reassess the structures
*  under their control, looking for hidden weaknesses.
*  The cracks in the spillway, the hillside that crumbles at the first sign of water.
*  That work is necessary, but it may not be enough to prevent the next disaster.
*  Bigger storms are on the way.
*  We still haven't severely tested California's primary flood control structures,
*  says Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.
*  The emergency spillway at Oraville, for example, was operating at about 3% of its capacity when
*  Hony ordered the evacuation.
*  If we had an even marginally bigger event on the weather front that year,
*  Swain says it would have been significantly worse.
*  Dale Cox, a former project manager at the United States Geological Survey, who has worked
*  extensively with Swain, told me that California's dams are unprepared for extreme weather
*  because state water authorities have a false sense of how bad flooding can get.
*  The peak of record is driving a lot of engineering decisions in the state, he says,
*  and that peak is an underestimate, maybe a gross one.
*  Already we are seeing several 100-year floods every 10 years.
*  Some of this miscalculation arises from our failure to account for climate change,
*  a problem that will only get worse as the atmosphere heats up and the amount of water vapor
*  it can carry increases. All of this infrastructure, Swain says, is designed for a climate that no longer
*  exists. But the error also lies in our understanding of the past. Most of the flood data that formed the
*  basis for the design of California's dams come from the past century, which was an unusually
*  placid period in the state's weather. Around three decades ago, meteorologists' mental map of the
*  state was given a jolt when satellites became sophisticated enough to pick up what came to be
*  called atmospheric rivers. These storms, which resemble a lasso of rain thrown across the Pacific
*  Ocean to the West Coast, deliver what Swain described to me as almost incomprehensible volumes of
*  water. In the mid-2000s, Cox assembled a group at the USGS to study what would happen if the
*  atmospheric rivers from two notable California flood years, 1969 and 1986 occurred back to back.
*  They named the resulting scenario the ArcStorm. Flooding throughout the state, water depths of up to
*  20 feet in the Central Valley and economic losses of $725 billion. When the report on this research
*  was done, the authors presented it to emergency managers, municipal authorities and dam owners,
*  including DWR. The response was demoralizing. They said, that's too big, that's ridiculous,
*  says Lucy Jones, the chief scientist for the project. The authors of the ArcStorm report had a
*  response ready, however. Their imaginary storm was modeled on the Great Flood of 1862, which also made
*  a lake of the Central Valley and destroyed by one account a quarter of all the buildings in the state.
*  The minute that you say this is too big, this couldn't happen, this is unrealistic,
*  says Michael Detinger, a hydrologist who worked on the report, I can just point at 1862 and say,
*  1862 was far worse than this. In April 2021, Cox took me on a walk along the American river,
*  about 30 minutes northeast of Sacramento. Somewhere downstream of Folsom Prison, he said,
*  was a reliable high watermark for the 1862 flood. Because it was so long ago,
*  water authorities didn't count it as an official peak of record, but it showed what the river
*  was capable of. It was a hot and sunny day, but Cox wore blue jeans, black vans, and a black t-shirt
*  with a paisley shirt over it. He looked like an aging session bassist with a gray go-t and sunglasses.
*  We established, after a thorough discussion of our respective genealogies, that we aren't related.
*  Cox was not a scientist, he had studied to be a journalist. My role is going out and getting
*  the ball rolling, starting the project, recruiting people, he said. His training proved useful because
*  it taught him how to cut across disciplines and how to ask a lot of annoying questions.
*  I could see his mind at work when he talked about a project to restore the natural banks of
*  the Los Angeles River. Experts had all sorts of solid objections or arguments in favor of it.
*  He was the one to ask, once these habitats reunite, will we have to worry about mountain lions
*  coming down and eating people's pets? About a mile up the American River Canyon, we reached a
*  gate that read Folsom State Prison, no trespassing. Cox pressed up against the fence and pointed
*  just up River to a flat spot on the bank across from us where there was a pile of boulders.
*  That, he said, is where Stockton and Coover Flower Mill once stood. Contemporary accounts noted that
*  the water reached the mill's stone stable, which survived into the 20th century.
*  By using the stable as a high water mark for the American River, researchers were able to set the
*  peak discharge of the river during the flood at more than 300,000 cubic feet per second,
*  greater than the median flow of the Mississippi River at St. Louis and far above the peak of record.
*  On the day I was there, the American River was rolling along steadily at 1,000 cubic feet per second.
*  Did presenting state officials with these numbers make a difference, I asked?
*  No, he said. So many of the officials he talked to about arc storm were like the mayor in jaws,
*  unwilling to see a problem they couldn't fix. Most officials wanted to do nothing if possible,
*  or if they had to do something, they wanted it to be the cheapest thing they could get away with.
*  Cox thought part of the reason he faced resistance was that a flood is not a charismatic disaster
*  like an earthquake. It is less sudden, less dramatic, the wreckage uglier.
*  Whereas an earthquake is more like an act of God, he said, flooding points out the flaws of man.
*  The original plan for the arc storm scenario was to have DWR and other agencies translate the
*  storms they had created into water on the ground, turning meteorology into hydrology.
*  But according to Cox, DWR ghosted the arc storm project about three quarters of the way through.
*  He never got a straight answer about why, but one of his contacts there told him it was political.
*  Is that a capital P or a small P Cox asked? My own reporting would eventually reveal another
*  possible answer. The numbers were scary enough to shut down any discussion.
*  The best the arc storm team could manage for the final report was this line, buried on page 59,
*  which read like a statement from a hostage negotiation. Because of the extremely sensitive nature of a
*  damn damage scenario, the selection of a particular dam to imagine as hypothetically damaged in such a way
*  is left to emergency planners. After 2017, Detinger and Cox made a list of what they would do
*  differently if they could start over from scratch. What are the things that we assumed wouldn't
*  happen or that we just misjudged where they might happen? Detinger says, and top of that list was,
*  man, we shouldn't have taken damn safety off the table.
*  Damn failures are rare, but when they happen, they can be deadly.
*  Nearly as many lives were lost following the 1889 collapse of the South Fork Dam near Johnstown,
*  Pennsylvania as in the attack on Pearl Harbor. When St. Francis Dam near Los Angeles breached in 1928,
*  it unleashed a wall of water that was initially 140 feet tall, carrying off people and houses and
*  animals before emptying into the Pacific Ocean some 50 miles away. And yet, as I discovered in
*  examining the fallout from Oravill, damn safety is an orphaned problem. Media-erologists tend to
*  talk only about the weather. Hydrologists will tell you only about stream flows. Engineers know about
*  concrete, but can't comment on climate. Climateologists look at systems but rarely want to make
*  specific predictions. Everyone is stuck in the mezzascale, the realm between macro and microclimate
*  concerns, where everything is just fine-grained enough to appear blurry. Ultimately, responsibility
*  lies with state and federal authorities, but it's not clear that any single entity is capable of
*  seeing the whole picture. So much water is moved around California by so many different agencies,
*  Joan Didian wrote in 1977 that maybe only the movers themselves know on any given day whose water
*  is where. Little has changed since then. DWR has regulatory authority over more than 1,200 dams.
*  The Bureau of Reclamation owns and operates 45, including some of the largest in the state,
*  and hundreds more belong to private utilities and local water authorities from Wairika to Chulavista.
*  For any dam receiving federal funding, the Army Corps of Engineers also plays a role. The
*  Corps usually had at least a hand in, if not total responsibility for, the building of these dams,
*  and it helped write the water control manual for each of them. The manual dictates when a dam
*  should hold on to water during a flood and when it should release it. It is the Bible for dam
*  operations, with one unbreakable commandment. A dam shall not be overtopped. Detinger was the first
*  person to tip me off that dam owners may have a bigger problem than they've publicly acknowledged.
*  He began by telling me about a meeting he and the art storm team had in La Jolla with Maurice
*  Rousse, the former chief hydrologist for DWR who had been with the department since 1957.
*  In that meeting, Rousse claimed that full some dam, which is owned by the Bureau of Reclamation,
*  had come within six hours of overtopping in 1986. Six more hours of rain and the dam might have
*  been lost. Detinger said that something similar had happened in 2017, even while everyone was
*  watching Auroville. I'm told by people who know these things pretty well at DWR that there were
*  some significant risks elsewhere, where they really were in danger of having the water go over
*  the top of some of these dams. He calmed the overall situation spooky. Without a detailed model of how
*  the art storm would translate into water levels within the state's reservoirs, though,
*  the authors of the report were left gesturing at a general calamity.
*  That was the outstanding missing piece, says Christine Albano, a researcher at the Desert Research
*  Institute in Reno, Nevada, who worked with the art storm team. To remedy that, shortly before
*  his retirement, Cox began assembling a new group of collaborators, including Albano and Swain,
*  for a project he called art storm 2.0. Specifically, the group wanted to examine how a warmer
*  climate would strengthen atmospheric rivers, and they wanted to finally plug that weather data
*  into a hydrological model to see what it would do to the state's flood control infrastructure.
*  The first half of that work is done. In August, Swain and Xingying Huang of the National Center for
*  Atmospheric Research published a paper that predicted a storm called ARC Future that would be a
*  supercharged version of 1862, 30 days of unrelenting rain across the whole state.
*  It would be a transformational event for California without any doubt if and when it
*  recurs, Swain says. In the next 40 years, he and Huang determined the odds of such a storm sequence
*  occurring were as high as 50%. The detailed hydrology for ARC Storm 2.0 is still being worked out,
*  but Albano told me that the Army Corps had already done a preliminary analysis.
*  At her suggestion, Mike Bartles and engineer at the Army Corps's Hydraulic Engineering Center
*  had run the sequence through a model he developed. The results were astounding, but she wasn't sure
*  she could send them to me directly. Armed with Albano's information, I went to the Army Corps to
*  request a copy of Bartles' analysis. It took time to receive approval. We have a completed draft
*  response that is undergoing internal review, but eventually the document arrived in my inbox.
*  A series of charts detailing what would happen to six of the largest reservoirs in California
*  during the 30-day storm sequence predicted by Swain and Huang.
*  Some of the information was merely alarming. By matching up Bartles' data with public information
*  about the reservoir's outlet capacities, I could imagine the floods playing out in real time.
*  It was apparent that Auroville Dam's emergency spillway would be tested again,
*  as much as two old days of water running down the dirt slope at levels far beyond those seen in 2017.
*  The same went for Don Pedro Dam, which would need to push huge volumes of water over
*  its never-before-used emergency spillway. Even if the dam survived, the expected outflow from Don Pedro
*  would be multiple times the capacity of the levees downstream. Other parts of the document were
*  terrifying. Two large dams owned by the Bureau of Reclamation, Friant and Nume Alonus looked
*  likely to overtop. Each would have periods when they would be taking on water faster than they
*  could spill it, and they would reach those moments when the reservoirs were nearly full.
*  Friant Dam, which is situated in the hills above Fresno, population 544,500, would take on an
*  incredible six times its total volume in the course of the month. Nume Alonus would have a peak
*  inflow that was more than twice what it could release, and its spillway couldn't be used until
*  the water was near the crest of the dam. In the probable inundation zone for Nume Alonus,
*  were most of the 218,800 people of Modesto. If these projections were correct,
*  it would create an unprecedented amount of destruction. The Army Corps studied what would happen
*  to six dams in California, and the results suggested that two of them would probably be overtopped.
*  It seemed unlikely that a third of all the dams in the state would fail, but would none of them?
*  When reached for comment, the Army Corps stressed that the model was largely theoretical,
*  and not meant to demonstrate the hydrologic, hydraulic, and economic consequences that would be
*  likely to occur during this hypothetical event. The Bureau of Reclamation did not reply to a
*  request for comment on the models prepared by Bartles, but the Army Corps confirmed that the
*  organization had been briefed on them. Cox described the weird Chinatown vibe he encountered
*  whenever the conversation turned to dams. I knew what he was talking about. In the course of my
*  reporting this article, sources would stutter and shut down whenever dams came up.
*  Public documents that might have been easily emailed to me instead had to be extracted via
*  Freedom of Information Act or Public Records Act requests. In one memorable moment,
*  the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services sent me a copy of the Northern California
*  Catastrophic Flood Response Plan that was markedly different from a draft version I had found.
*  The changes all played down the risks involved.
*  I thought of Cox's comment after I sent the flooding models for ArcStorm 2.0 to Dettinger,
*  where he had once been voluble, I'll talk your arm off, he told me during our first conversation.
*  Now he shut down the discussion quickly. I have nothing to say about the inflows because they're
*  not my numbers. He wrote to me in an email. Please, just lose my email address, okay?
*  I never heard from him again. In March, I drove to Ouroville to see what had changed since 2017.
*  Even dams that should be able to handle the flows from swain and Huang's storm would still need
*  to perform perfectly. The water would find any weaknesses. On the way up from Sacramento,
*  the signs of the wet winter were everywhere, flooded fields, glinting like mica on the horizon,
*  brown hills turned green, a waterway called Dry Creek overflowing its banks.
*  Originally, Dale Cox was meant to accompany me for the meeting, but DWR pulled permission
*  for him to go at the last minute. My boss approved, but it was nixed by higher ups,
*  the public information officer at the dam wrote. When I relayed this message to Cox, he smiled
*  rooffully. The fact they didn't want me there is wonderful," he said.
*  I was surprised. Recently, DWR agreed to fund hydrological studies based on
*  ARK Storm 2.0, similar to the ones done by Bartles. And when I spoke with Carla Namath,
*  who has been DWR's director since 2018, she was refreshingly candid about the challenges ahead.
*  She called the ARK Storm 2.0's storm sequence plausible, even though it's a tough scenario to put
*  on the table because it's overwhelming. Namath also admitted that some of the state's dams were
*  not up to snuff. Under her leadership, DWR had begun to plan for major disruptions caused by
*  flooding, not least the prospect of moving hundreds of thousands of people out of harm's way on
*  short notice. Do you ever feel overwhelmed, I asked? I do," she said. Which DWR was I meeting in
*  Oravill, the political one that Cox knew or the plane-speaking one that Namath represented.
*  In a conference room at the dam's operations center, the same room that served as Command Center
*  in 2017, I sat down with Turnquist, who was now an engineering manager at the dam,
*  and John Yarbro, an assistant deputy director of DWR, who had come up from headquarters in Sacramento.
*  Yarbro pointed out that after 2017, there were checks on complacency at DWR,
*  independent audits, extensive risk assessments, decennial reviews of each dam's design assumptions.
*  All that supervision had pushed DWR to make internal changes as well. Yarbro walked me through a
*  16-point plan for reform. We feel like we're more mature now, he said. Yarbro and Turnquist agreed to
*  give me a tour of Oravill's new spillways, which required a 10-minute drive up a road that wound
*  its way along the Feather River. At the top of the dam, we walked over to the main spillway,
*  where the water seemed to be slipping under our feet, like a treadmill set to the highest speed.
*  Far below, it hit a row of blocks known as dentates, creating a giant plume of water and mist
*  that jumped into the air. Eventually, re-reached the emergency spillway. Since 2017,
*  the ground has been covered in roller-compacted concrete, which forms a 1,200-foot wide staircase
*  that drops down the hill. I was surprised to see it stopped well before it reached the river.
*  Although arc-future would, in theory, require extensive use of the emergency spillway,
*  both Yarbro and Turnquist deflected the question of what would happen when it was used for the first
*  time. Yarbro said they were still studying how much erosion would occur, though they expected
*  some where the emergency spillway ended. Turnquist pointed out that if the main spillway was running
*  at full capacity, it would already be a catastrophe. If we have 270,000 cubic feet per second going
*  out of the spillway, most of the downstream levees are going to be failed. That species of fatalism
*  crops up frequently in discussions of extreme flooding. During an event like arc-future,
*  perfect operation of a dam would take the total inflow, which comes in peaks and troughs,
*  and parcel it out evenly. But most dams can't even release large amounts of water until they
*  are nearly full, and even the best forecasts won't allow a dam operator to know what's coming
*  much more than five days in advance. As flood control, dams are good at capturing single storms.
*  Send California 30 days of rain, and there's not much they can do.
*  Still, there are efforts to chip away at both problems. The day after I went to Oraville,
*  I drove into the Sierra Foothills near Merrie'sville where I met John James, the director of resource
*  planning for Uba Water, which operates New Bullards Bar Dam. Our first stop was a spot just opposite
*  the dam's spillway, which was thundering down the sides of a steep canyon. Upriver, we could see
*  the broad concrete arch of the dam. Down below, the north Uba River was cold, clear, aquamarine.
*  James said that New Bullards Bar had recently become part of a pilot program known as
*  Forecast-informed reservoir operations. Understanding procedures,
*  Uba Water was allowed to schedule releases only in response to actual reservoir levels.
*  With fear, though, more water could be spilled in advance if the forecast called for a big storm,
*  and more water could be held back if meteorologists predicted a dry spell.
*  That forecast wasn't terribly useful, however, without the second part of Uba's plan,
*  a new spillway which they wanted to install to the right of the current one.
*  Crucially, its intake would be lower, allowing it to release water even when the reservoir was
*  nowhere near the crest. If they spotted a dangerous looking amount of rain coming their way,
*  they could spill water early when the river was low, and then hold back more when the rain was
*  falling and the Uba was running high. They called it the arc spillway for atmospheric river control.
*  We drove to the spot at the top of the dam where construction would begin. The reservoir stretched
*  out in front of us, looking blue and inviting. More so than an embankment dam, the sweep of a
*  concrete arch dam looks impossible somehow, a flimsy curtain holding back an unimaginably large
*  amount of water, on one side an ocean, on the other thin air. It was like a magic trick.
*  One study commissioned by Uba suggested that if the arc spillway had been available to use during
*  the floods of 1997, the water in the Uba River would have been 2-3 feet lower.
*  That year, levees throughout the region failed, and 23,000 homes were destroyed.
*  Had the new spillway been in place, the levees might have held.
*  Uba hopes to complete the project in the next 10 years.
*  I wondered why more dam operators weren't looking into retrofits like the arc spillway.
*  At a meeting with DWR officials about Auroville, one county supervisor asked the same question.
*  If truly we are in global warming, global climate change, and all the experts say we'll have bigger
*  storms quicker, then maybe we need to have a way to let out water sooner.
*  There was an important precedent. In 2017, full some dam opened an auxiliary spillway that
*  sits 50 feet lower than the main one, allowing the Bureau of Reclamation to release water earlier
*  and increasing the total capacity for releases during extreme floods.
*  The answer to the supervisor's question though might be found in Folsom's price tag.
*  The project allowed the dam to gain 200-year flood protection, but it cost $900 million.
*  The Bartles' projections for all their ingenuity are a forecast built upon a forecast.
*  Not the kind of evidence that seems to generate all that many $900 million checks.
*  They also don't cover any dam south of Fresno.
*  To consider the risks to that area, we have to return to the historic record.
*  In arguing for the plausibility of their storm scenarios, both the arc storm and arc storm
*  2.0 teams cited the work of Art Shimmelman, a senior scientist in the Department of Earth and
*  Atmospheric Sciences at Indiana University Bloomington, and Ingrid Hendy, a professor in the Earth
*  and Environmental Sciences Department at the University of Michigan, who have been conducting an
*  ingenious series of experiments examining what's known as the Paleo-Flood History of California.
*  The largest floods push sediment into the Pacific, where it settles on the ocean floor.
*  One stretch of coastline near Santa Barbara has proved to be particularly pristine when it comes to
*  preserving this sediment record. By extracting core samples from this site, Hendy and Shimmelman
*  were able to see evidence of the 1862 floods, visible as a gray layer. There were no significant
*  gray layers in the 160 years that followed. But by looking deeper into the seabed,
*  they found evidence of major floods that recurred on average every 120 years.
*  They also found a gray layer that was 10 times thicker than the one from 1862.
*  Hendy and Shimmelman's research is sounding the same warning as swain and hwangs.
*  Whether you believe the computer models or the sediment cores,
*  it's hard to escape the conclusion that the next gray layer is going to arrive soon.
*  So what would a repeat of 1862, which Hendy called a relatively small event,
*  due to Southern California's dams? We can get a hint of what would happen,
*  because as it turns out, there's another high water mark from 1862 there.
*  Along the Santa Ana River in a city called Colton, there's a patch of land
*  fenced off from the industrial zone that surrounds it. This is the Aguamansa Pioneer Cemetery,
*  the last remnant of what was once the biggest town in the region.
*  The first Adobe houses at Aguamansa, the name means gentle water, were built in the 1840s.
*  In 1853, the settlers there, most of whom came from New Mexico,
*  built a sturdy church several hundred feet uphill of the Santa Ana.
*  The river, as the town name suggests, spends most of its days as little more than a trickle.
*  In drought years, it barely even reaches the Pacific.
*  In 1862, however, the rain started falling and did not stop.
*  Edward Everett Ayer, a Union soldier stationed in San Bernardino,
*  wrote in his diary of a storm that absolutely tore Southern California to pieces,
*  leaving water, water everywhere, and little above.
*  Hundreds of miles north, the flood even caught up with Mark Twain,
*  who found himself stranded for eight days at a boarding house near Carson City, Nevada,
*  while he was out west prospecting for gold and silver.
*  Our inn was on an island in mid-ocean, he wrote,
*  as far as the eye could reach in the moonlight, there was no desert visible,
*  but only a level waste of shining water.
*  Twain's testimony, unfortunately, is exactly what the hydrologists say we can't rely on
*  when planning for the present. It's imprecise, anecdotal, and emotionally tinged,
*  helpful fodder for a novel, but useless for an engineer.
*  Aguimansa, however, holds the secret to the flood on the Santa Ana in the same way that the
*  Stockton and Coover Mill can unlock the one on the American. Because although most of the town
*  was swept away in 1862, the church survived. Indeed, the priest saved multiple lives by calling
*  the townspeople there on January 22nd. As they watched, the water climbed closer and closer
*  until it reached the stone steps of the church, but it went no farther.
*  From those steps, the USGS was able to determine more than 100 years later the flow of the Santa
*  Ana on January 22nd. 320,000 cubic feet per second.
*  20 miles up river from the Aguimansa cemetery is Seven Oaks Dam, completed by the Army Corps
*  in 2002, and one of the largest earth-filled dams in the world. Unlike Oraville, Seven Oaks is
*  meant for one thing, to take a surging river and throttle it, protecting the cities of San Bernadino,
*  Riverside, and farther downstream, Anaheim and Huntington Beach. During a storm, no matter how much
*  water is rolling down the mountains into the Santa Ana, the same maximum flow should emerge from
*  an outlet at the bottom of the dam, 7,000 cubic feet per second. During the design phase for a dam,
*  engineers calculate what's known as the probable maximum flood, which the Army Corps defined as
*  the flood that can be expected from the most severe combination of meteorologic and hydrologic
*  conditions to be reasonably possible in the region. According to the design memorandum for Seven Oaks,
*  the inflow during the probable maximum flood would be 180,000 cubic feet per second.
*  When I visited Seven Oaks in May 2021, there was barely any water in the reservoir.
*  Since construction, the Army Corps had turned over day-to-day operations at the dam to San Bernadino
*  County, which sent a technician named Dan Worthington to give me a tour. We drove up switchbacks on
*  the face of the dam itself, which was covered in pillow-sized rounded rocks. I saw striations on
*  the hills around us, the work of the San Andreas fault, which runs right through the dam.
*  The fault is one reason Seven Oaks, which was built to withstand a magnitude 8.0 earthquake,
*  had to be an Earth-filled dam. A concrete dam would crack.
*  Worthington said it had been a quiet 20 years at Seven Oaks. Droughts had tested operations more
*  often than floods. In 2005, though, enough rain fell that the reservoir rose 120 feet overnight.
*  The staff took bets on how high it would reach. We arrived at the spillway, a wide bench cut
*  into the bedrock next to the dam. The high water mark from 2005 was 188 feet below us.
*  Later, I asked the lead engineer for the dam, Robert Kwan, whether he thought the spillway
*  would be used in his lifetime. Personally, I don't think so, he said.
*  Maybe our kids, grandkids, great grandkids. The water hasn't come close to it in any storm since
*  the dam was built. There is room for an aircraft carrier inside the spillway channel,
*  but was it wide enough to safely pass the flow predicted by the USGS at Aguimansa?
*  Because Seven Oaks is upstream of Aguimansa, the full 320,000 cubic feet per second wouldn't
*  flow into the dam. So I asked Kwan what would happen if 300,000 cubic feet per second drained into
*  the reservoir. He repeated the number back to me. Okay, so for 300,000 cubic feet per second at the
*  dam, yeah. He was silent for a while, doing the math in his head. Then you're looking at
*  probably not only spilling over the spillway, but over the top of the dam, he said. In fact,
*  it would take only 162 minutes to fill the six feet of freeboard between the spillway and the top
*  of the dam. The Army Corps denied that such a sustained and extreme flow at Seven Oaks was possible.
*  I ran the math again using more conservative numbers, chosen to accord with the different
*  flows at the two sites during the 1938 flood on the Santa Ana, but the result was still more than
*  20% above the probable maximum flood. If the storms were more in line with the thicker gray layers
*  seen by Shemelman and Handy, of course, the numbers would go even higher. Kwan said that Seven
*  Oaks was one of his first assignments after he joined the Army Corps. He got to see it go from a
*  sketch to a fully operating dam, but he didn't register any emotion when confronted with the
*  probability that it would fail in a repeat of 1862. Instead, he shifted to talking about the
*  dam break analysis that the Army Corps had done and the inundation map it prepared. He's an engineer
*  after all. From the top of Seven Oaks, you can see the crowded valley below, home to more than 4
*  million people. If you keep following the Santa Ana, you'll reach the hills above Anaheim and
*  Orange County, home to millions more. The wave running down the river following a dam breach
*  would remain high all the way to those hills. Nearly a mile from the dam, it would still be 69 feet
*  from top to bottom. By the time it got to the San Bernardino Airport an hour later,
*  it would have spread out and slowed down at merely 30 feet tall.
*  The inundation map shows all that would be caught in its path. Red dots for fire stations, purple
*  dots for police stations, green squares for schools, Highland Grove Elementary, Cypress Elementary,
*  Lancashem Elementary, Warm Springs Elementary, Bing Wong Elementary, Monterey Elementary, H. Frank
*  Dominguez Elementary, Urbita Elementary, Woodrow Wilson Elementary, Patricia B.T. Elementary,
*  Fremont Elementary, Ena Arbuckle Elementary, West Riverside Elementary. Houses would be knocked
*  off their foundations, warehouses would crumple, commercial jets would be tossed about.
*  Much of the infrastructure along the river ridges, highways and railroads would be washed away.
*  Thousands of people would have minutes to evacuate. The death toll would be far higher than that
*  of an ordinary flood. If the surge found a flaw in Prado Dam which sits above Orange County,
*  all of Anaheim would be added to the inundation zone, Disneyland included, before the water met the sea.
*  In 1986, during one of the worst floods Northern California experienced in the 20th century,
*  Mike Detinger was stranded on point rays with a colleague and both their families,
*  including Detinger's nine-month-old daughter. We were a bunch of groundwater hydrologists and we
*  knew there was a storm coming in but really had no sense of how bad it was going to be, he told me.
*  They ended up driving their Cadillac across a flooded road and losing control of it.
*  The two families spent the next night sleeping in a fire station and the one after that
*  in the manager's office of a local motel. Getting people to believe the evidence in front of them
*  is the first step toward a solution, but it's only the first step. The threat to California's dams
*  is no longer akin to twanes being surprised by a flash flood. It's Detinger in the Cadillac heading
*  into the torrent. The siren is blaring but still we don't change course. Engineers could keep
*  raising the levees, holding back the water as best they can. Dam owners could build more spillways
*  like the one at Folsom or the Ark spillway planned for New Bullards Bar. And state authorities
*  could get better at evacuations, start drilling for dam failures as we do for earthquakes.
*  Probably California will have to do all three, but climate change requires a different kind of
*  adaptation. What if rather than trying to out-engineer the weather or evacuate and return in an
*  endless cycle, we changed where and how we live? It would be not an administrative feat,
*  but a psychological one, an attempt to check in John McFee's words, the powerful fabric of ambition
*  that impelled people to build towns and cities where almost any camper would be loath to pitch
*  a tent. Americans aren't good at retreating and the ones who wound up in California, the cliche
*  goes, are the people who didn't stop pushing forward until they ran out of continent.
*  The indigenous population though knew a floodplain when they saw one.
*  Is it unimaginable that we might learn that lesson as we unlearn the ones of the 20th century?
*  Maybe this could be California. It's a drought year. The streams dry up. There's barely enough water
*  for the people and the crops and the animals, but because there aren't too many of them, they survive.
*  The next year it floods. The snow builds in the Sierra, storm after incredible storm until the
*  spring arrives and it all goes rushing out to the ocean. The people though live well above the rising
*  water. The storms are intense, but after each one passes, the land around them, done and brittle
*  and dusty for years now, blooms with a million newborn flowers and endless gold-green grasses.
