*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro.
*  This is a Daily.
*  Yesterday on the show, we explained how a major strike against Hollywood studios has finally
*  been resolved.
*  But another major strike against U.S. automakers is expanding and is now becoming a flash
*  point in the presidential race.
*  Former President Donald Trump will skip the second Republican primary debate, according
*  to the New York Times, the former President plans to travel to Detroit where he will give
*  a speech to over 500 current and former members of the United Auto Workers Union.
*  President Biden today inserted himself at a labor dispute in a way no other modern
*  President has, joining striking auto workers on the picket line outside of GM Plant near Detroit.
*  Today, my colleague Jonathan Weissman on why President Biden and former President Trump
*  see the workers involved in this strike as so essential to winning the White House and
*  the profoundly different strategies that they're relying on to win them over.
*  It's Thursday, September 28th.
*  Jonathan, it is very rare for a labor strike to attract both a sitting President, Joe Biden
*  and his leading rival for the presidency, in this case former President Donald Trump,
*  to the place where they are holding the strike.
*  Yet here we are.
*  So how do you think about that?
*  We're at such an unprecedented moment.
*  First of all, the United Auto Workers are on strike against all three of the big three
*  that is Ford General Motors and Stellantis, which we used to call Chrysler.
*  This is the broadest strike we've seen in decades.
*  Right now, there are picket lines at around 40 different plants and distribution centers
*  and the United Auto Workers are seeking really remarkable gains.
*  They want raises of about 40 percent.
*  They want more time off.
*  And they want the gains that they feel they lost after the Great Recession.
*  It's happening during a presidential election in which the two main front runners, Joe Biden
*  and Donald Trump, see their path to the White House through Union America and specifically
*  through the state of Michigan, the historic center of the auto industry, which Donald
*  Trump won in 2016 very narrowly.
*  Right.
*  And Joe Biden won in 2020 a little less narrowly.
*  And they are going to Michigan to appeal to workers who, if not actually on strike, are
*  certainly supporting the strikers.
*  And one of the most interesting things about this is that both of these candidates are
*  saying to the workers, I'm your guy, but they have very, very different messages.
*  Well, Jonathan, let's talk through those very different messages and what this strike
*  means to both Biden and Trump in this campaign season.
*  And I want to start with President Biden.
*  Yeah, Joe Biden.
*  This is a guy who has made his brand unions.
*  Hello, organized labor.
*  He emerged as scranton Joe from Northeast Pennsylvania.
*  My dad used to have an expression, I swear to God.
*  He said, Joey, it jobs about a lot more than a paycheck for real.
*  The son of the working class.
*  It's about your dignity.
*  It's about respect.
*  He has made union organizing and being pro labor really his brand.
*  I am a union man.
*  A ran for president saying he was going to help unions organize and expand.
*  I intend to be the most pro union president.
*  Me the most pro union administration in American history.
*  That unions made the middle class and he is going to help unions reemerge
*  as the center of American middle income power.
*  Right.
*  And despite the fact that for many years, and we learned this lesson when Donald Trump,
*  when the president said in 2016, that Democrats have lost a lot of support in that world
*  of unionized working class voters, Biden did pretty darn well with them.
*  That's right.
*  He showed real gains, especially in the upper Midwest.
*  We're talking about what we used to call the blue wall, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.
*  The gains that he made among the working class, especially the white working class,
*  really were decisive in the election of 2020.
*  Right.
*  So heading into this U.A.W. strike, that is the reservoir of goodwill that Biden has to call upon.
*  That's right.
*  But there was a conflicting piece of his message because as he was appealing to the working
*  class with his messages about labor and unions, he was also appealing to more liberal voters
*  who wanted to see the government take action against climate change.
*  I would do everything in my power, clean our air and water, protect our people's health,
*  to win the clean energy future.
*  He was also going to be the president that finally started moving the United States away from
*  fossil fuels.
*  A future of the automobile industry that is electric, battery, electric plug-in, hybrid,
*  electric fuel cell, electric is electric.
*  And there's no turning back.
*  The question is whether we'll lead or fall behind in the race for the future.
*  But the challenge is doing both things at once, creating union jobs and green jobs.
*  A lot of my friends in organized labor know, when I think climate, I think jobs.
*  I think union jobs, not a joke.
*  Because when it comes to the auto industry, electric vehicles fundamentally take fewer
*  workers to build than the old internal combustion engine cars did.
*  Well, say a little bit more about that, this tension for Biden between supporting auto
*  workers in the union and his climate agenda at the same time.
*  Yeah, I mean, the fact is that electric cars are simpler than traditional cars.
*  Things like drive trains and catalytic converters disappear when the engine is really being
*  operated by a battery.
*  And at the moment, they're generally not built by union workers.
*  You know, people love their Teslas, but those Teslas are not being built by organized
*  labor.
*  Those are non-union shops.
*  Other companies are coming in from abroad like Hyundai.
*  And they are setting up their big auto plants in the south where there aren't unions and
*  where the state governments are very hostile to unions.
*  And that's where also the battery companies are coming in.
*  Those battery makers are the ones that are replacing the workers that now are building
*  transmissions and catalytic converters.
*  And if they're not unionized, the movement is away from the unions, not toward unions.
*  And so Joe Biden has this problem.
*  He needs to be able to say that the electric vehicle future is bright for American workers
*  and at the same time, he understands that for now, electric vehicle labor is not unionized.
*  So Jonathan, how does President Biden reconcile these two sides of his political identity in
*  this moment amid this strike?
*  The Green Revolution, Joe, and the Union, Joe.
*  So he's throwing his weight entirely behind the UAW.
*  And when the UAW president, Sean Fein, invited him to come to Michigan, he overrode the
*  opposition of some of his aides and said, I'm going.
*  I'm getting on that plane.
*  And he showed up at a UAW picket, which is unprecedented for a president.
*  So then we see President Biden wearing a UAW hat.
*  On the picket line, holding a sign, he makes a few quick remarks on a makeshift stage.
*  He's in broadcast his support for the union's position against Detroit management.
*  So what he's doing here going to the UAW picket lines is trying to throw presidential
*  weight behind the UAW to get as good a contract as he can for the union so that the union
*  can then take that contract from the big three automakers to these new battery plants or
*  to these foreign electric vehicle makers and extend union organizing where it isn't
*  now.
*  Hmm.
*  This is a little bit complicated, but what Biden's hoping for is that a winning UAW contract
*  translates into an ability by the UAW to unionize the rest of the electric vehicle market
*  in places where they're not yet unionized.
*  Or by solving that problem you mentioned earlier of this vast EV market that relies on
*  non-unionized labor.
*  Correct.
*  His pitch is green energy jobs are good union jobs.
*  He just has to make that a reality.
*  And if Biden can't actually deliver that, he'll have to own that.
*  People will blame him for ushering in a green revolution that happens in non-union
*  plants.
*  And how does the UAW see this vision?
*  That's pretty complicated vision that Biden is outlining.
*  They understand rhetorically that Biden is with them, but they want to see real concrete
*  legislation and regulations that benefit them, which is why the union with its very aggressive
*  new leadership under their president Sean Fein has withheld the endorsement for Biden's
*  reelection because they feel like he could and should have done more for them as their
*  industry moves toward electric vehicles.
*  And Biden has tried in the inflation reduction act of 2022, which included all sorts of incentives
*  to move the country toward electric vehicles.
*  He got a few provisions that help the unions, for instance, tax credits for the hiring
*  of union apprentices.
*  But the big one, which was a bonus tax credit for the hiring of unionized workers, that
*  was stripped out at the last minute by Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia.
*  So there are limits to what Biden can do for the unions.
*  So the UAW's message to Biden is basically do better, work harder, and show us that you
*  understand just how existential a thread the electric vehicle is to our workers.
*  And that's why Joe Biden was on the picket lines on Tuesday with the UAW to basically say,
*  not only do I hear you, but I am pausing my busy schedule as President of the United States
*  to literally be here with you as you strike.
*  The first president that we know to ever walk the picket lines of a strike, it's a remarkable
*  moment.
*  Now just because the UAW has withheld its endorsement of Joe Biden doesn't mean they're even
*  flirting with the idea of endorsing Donald Trump.
*  They know Trump is anti-organized labor.
*  And you know, Sean Fain, the president of the UAW, really hates Trump, is very outspoken
*  and he's very popular.
*  But Trump thinks that he can appeal to the rank and file of UAW members with a much simpler
*  message.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Jonathan, walk us through Donald Trump's strategy for winning over the rank and file
*  of the United Auto Workers, given the reality that the union's leadership, as you just
*  told us, is pretty wary of Trump.
*  Donald Trump has shown a remarkable ability to tear union voters away from their leaders
*  and the marching orders that union organizers have given their voters.
*  He can go around the union leadership and go straight to the union voters and say,
*  I'm your guy.
*  You know, in 2016, he had vanished a few union leaders actually behind him and yet his
*  appeal to union workers helped him break the blue wall in Upper Midwest and win the presidency
*  by winning Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.
*  And he's done this not just with auto workers.
*  We will lift the restrictions on American energy, including shale, oil, natural gas, and
*  clean, beautiful coal.
*  Put our miners back to work.
*  He's done this with coal miners.
*  He can reopen the coal mines.
*  We're going to bring steel back to Pennsylvania, like it used to be.
*  We can bring steel back to the United States.
*  We are not going to allow our jobs to be taken from our states anymore.
*  He has this way of telling voters he can turn back time.
*  Right.
*  Make America great.
*  Again, has always contained a promise to reverse a lot of the changes that have been made
*  to the working class American economy.
*  It's an appeal to nostalgia and it has really worked.
*  And we're seeing that playbook all over again with electric vehicles.
*  Electric cars will kill more than half of US auto jobs and it's going to decimate more
*  than anybody else.
*  The state of Michigan is going to be decimation.
*  It's going to be the auto workers are not going to have any jobs when you come right down
*  to it because if you take a look at what they're doing with electric cars, electric
*  cars are going to be made in China.
*  Trump's fundamental pitch is we don't need to move to electric vehicles.
*  Climate changes are hoax.
*  We can stick with the internal combustion engine.
*  Electric vehicles are all made in China and electric vehicles are the threat, not the
*  future.
*  So Trump's basic message to the UAW in this labor conflict is that there are problems
*  that could be solved if they were just take the electric vehicle out of the equation.
*  That's right.
*  Biden is a catastrophe for Michigan and his environmental extremism is heartless and
*  disloyal and horrible for the American worker and you're starting to see it.
*  If you want to have an auto industry, you need to defeat Joe Biden.
*  He's a corrupt president and reelect president Donald Trump.
*  And he wants electric vehicles to be Joe Biden's problem.
*  And he wants to be the guy who can liberate them from economic change and bring them back
*  to some housey on days when internal combustion engines were flowing out of Detroit like water.
*  But I'm thrilled to be back with the workers, UAW members and proud patriots of the great
*  state of Michigan.
*  And when Trump held a rally in Michigan Wednesday night, instead of going to the Republican
*  debate, he hit that message really hard.
*  You can be loyal to American labor or you can be loyal to the environmental lunatics,
*  but you can't really be loyal to both.
*  It's one of the other.
*  But it does make sense to remember that Trump's previous stabs at economic nostalgia
*  to use your word back in 2016 didn't play out the way he promised they would.
*  He, like you said, claimed he could turn back time on coal and coal mining and he was
*  wrong.
*  And now he's saying that you can turn back time on EVs, which seems pretty complicated.
*  They have become such an essential part of the big three automakers future.
*  So why would a unionized auto worker believe Trump's claim here?
*  Well, you're right, Michael.
*  I mean, when Donald Trump was pitching the coal miners that he was going to keep those
*  mines open, that didn't pan out.
*  But if you think about the mindset of the miners, they had nothing to lose.
*  Their minds were going away.
*  They could put their hopes in this man.
*  And if it didn't work out, they didn't lose anything that they weren't going to lose
*  anyway.
*  In this case, Trump's got a much harder pitch here.
*  He's going to electric vehicle workers and saying stop the electric vehicle transition.
*  These electric vehicle workers are going to look at each other and say, what's he talking
*  about?
*  He wants to stop the electric vehicle transition.
*  We're working for electric vehicle makers now.
*  Our question isn't whether our jobs are going to exist.
*  Our question is whether our pay is going to get better or our benefits are going to get
*  better under a union contract.
*  We're not disappearing.
*  We are the industry of the future.
*  So because this threat of the EV is not as existential as the previous economic threats
*  that Trump identified and campaigned against, Trump himself faces somewhat of a tricky
*  sales job here.
*  That's right.
*  So as both Trump and Biden make these two very different pitches to auto workers, Johnson,
*  I'm curious based on your reporting, which of their messages is most resonating with
*  the UAW membership?
*  You know, I was at a UAW plant last week.
*  You talk to a lot of workers.
*  They really do understand electric vehicles are the future.
*  They see the Tesla's on the road.
*  They spend $80 filling up the gas tank on their Ford F-150s.
*  They understand there is a great appeal to an electric vehicle future.
*  And they hear Trump.
*  They know that Trump's idea that you can just stop the movement toward EVs is probably
*  not right.
*  But they like him.
*  They like the way he talks.
*  They like the sense that Trump gets them and cares about them.
*  That's the big challenge that Joe Biden faces.
*  Can he also come across as really caring about them?
*  Jonathan, what you're saying suggests that even if President Biden can deliver this
*  complicated economic trick of delivering good paying union jobs and the EV revolution
*  at the same time, Trump's comparatively simpler message could still win the day for many
*  unionized workers, not just in the UAW, but across the country watching this.
*  And that will remind us of a lesson we've learned many times in many elections, which is
*  that economic policy and economic interest in elections can get pretty well divorced
*  from political loyalties that when it comes to voting, the head and the heart can go
*  separate ways.
*  As we've seen time and time again, voters do not necessarily vote in their own economic
*  interests.
*  They vote with their heart.
*  They vote by emotion.
*  The fight that we're seeing now developing is a fight for the hearts and minds of white
*  working class voters.
*  Donald Trump has difficult job as Biden here.
*  Trump has to reassemble that patchwork coalition that delivered the White House to him in 2016,
*  and that abandoned him in 2020.
*  But Joe Biden has the more difficult message, which is, look, I've done everything I
*  can for you.
*  The fact of the matter is the electric vehicle revolution is coming, whether you want it
*  or not.
*  Would you like to have somebody who guides it in favor of the unions?
*  Or would you like to have that other guy who's living in this fantasy world of coal mines
*  and steel mills and couldn't care less about electric vehicles?
*  I'm the guy for you.
*  It's time you come back to the party that recognizes the contributions of organized labor.
*  So who wins these union voters' support?
*  That really could determine who sits in the White House in 2025.
*  Well, Johnson, thank you very much.
*  Thanks for having me, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  I want to look at that camera right now and tell you Donald, I know you're watching.
*  You can't help yourself.
*  I know you're watching, okay?
*  And you're not here tonight because you're afraid of being on this stage and defending
*  your record.
*  You're ducking these things.
*  And let me tell you what's going to happen.
*  You keep doing that.
*  No one appears going to call you Donald Trump anymore.
*  We're going to call you Donald Duck.
*  In the second Republican presidential debate, Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey and Governor
*  Rhonda Santas of Florida mocked and taunted Donald Trump for skipping the event, saying
*  that he owes voters an explanation for what they said was his role in rising inflation
*  and a ballooning national debt.
*  Donald Trump is missing an action.
*  He should be on this stage tonight.
*  He owes it to you to defend his record where they added $7.8 trillion to the debt.
*  That set the stage for the inflation that we have.
*  Now I can tell you this is Governor.
*  With Trump off the stage, the candidates once again focused much of their fire on political
*  newcomer Vivek Ramaswamy, who has surged in the polls overshadowing long time elected
*  officials like former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who pointedly dismissed Ramaswamy
*  as a lightweight.
*  Once you've got, I honestly every time I hear you, I feel a little bit dumber for what
*  you say, because I can't believe they hear.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
