# Trump’s Case for Total Immunity
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpGNsZst804)
*  From the New York Times, this is The Daily.
*  I'm Natalie Ketroff.
*  Donald Trump has consistently argued that, as former president, he's immune from being
*  charged with a crime for what he did in office.
*  Today, my colleague Adam Liptak, on what happened when his lawyers made that case in federal
*  court, whether the extraordinary claim has any chance of being accepted, and why Trump
*  may win something valuable either way.
*  It's Wednesday, January 10th.
*  Adam, hi.
*  Welcome back to the show.
*  Hello.
*  So, Trump and his lawyers appeared in a federal appeals court Tuesday to make their case
*  that as a former president, Trump is immune from criminal prosecution.
*  Basically, that the Justice Department cannot charge him for a criminal act, which, if Trump
*  wins, seems like it would make a lot of his legal troubles go away.
*  Is that right?
*  Yeah, it's an extraordinary ask.
*  He says he has absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for anything resembling an official
*  act while he was president, even after he's no longer president.
*  Adam, can you take us back, just explain how we got here?
*  Well, the criminal case against former President Trump, I say the criminal case, the criminal
*  today because it's one of four, is a federal indictment brought by special counsel Jack
*  Smith arising from Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
*  So that charge is filed in federal district court in Washington, and among Trump's responses
*  a motion saying, you can't prosecute me because I have immunity from criminal prosecution
*  for my official acts when I was president.
*  And the trial judge considers that motion and rules against Donald Trump, says, we have
*  presidents not kings, and you're responsible for criminal conduct if the prosecution can
*  prove it.
*  Trump appeals, it goes to a three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for
*  the DC Circuit, a federal appeals court in Washington.
*  And they heard a very lively argument today.
*  So you said this was an extraordinary ask by the former president to be granted absolute
*  immunity.
*  Tell me about the Trump argument here.
*  Why would he be immune?
*  Mr. Sauer for the imbalance, Mr. Pierce for the epally.
*  Good morning.
*  Well, at 930 Tuesday morning, his lawyer, John Sauer steps up to the lectern addresses
*  the three judge panel and makes an aggressive argument.
*  If a president has to look over his shoulder or her shoulder every time he hears she has
*  to make a controversial decision, worry after I leave office, am I going to jail for this?
*  My political opponents take power that inevitably dampens the ability of the president.
*  He says a president is the head of one of the three branches of government, and that
*  gives him special power and special immunity from prosecution that we can't have our presidents
*  distracted when they're trying to make tough decisions.
*  To authorize the prosecution of a president for his official acts would open a Pandora's
*  box from which this nation may never recover.
*  And he says allowing criminal prosecutions would open up a Pandora's box of criminal
*  actions taken against former presidents of all kinds for all sorts of things.
*  Could George W. Bush be prosecuted for obstruction of an official proceeding for allegedly giving
*  false information to Congress to induce the nation to go to war in Iraq under false pretenses?
*  Could President Obama be potentially charged with murder for allegedly authorizing drone
*  strikes targeting U.S. citizens located abroad?
*  So he's saying that there could be this flood of prosecutions and that presidents need to
*  be able to operate without fear of that, that it could be dangerous to the public good,
*  it could interfere with the president's ability to execute his duties.
*  Yes, and there's a logic to that, Natalie.
*  We don't want our presidents distracted.
*  We want them to be able to make smart decisions in real time about very difficult questions
*  without looking over their shoulders, without being afraid of prosecution.
*  And the Supreme Court has, in a limited way, endorsed this idea in a case from 1982 called
*  Nixon v. Fitzgerald.
*  When President Richard Nixon was a former president, he was being sued by a whistleblower
*  who said that Nixon had unfairly dismissed him.
*  And the court says we can't have constant lawsuits against even former presidents because
*  that would make their day jobs really difficult when they're thinking about, am I going to
*  be sued for something?
*  And therefore, by a five to four vote, in the context of civil litigation, where people
*  are seeking money, private parties seeking money, not criminal conduct, the Supreme Court
*  says yes.
*  The president has absolute immunity from being sued for money up to the outer perimeter of
*  his official conduct.
*  But that's one category.
*  Lawsuits for money are one category, and the Supreme Court has spoken to that.
*  It hasn't directly spoken to criminal prosecutions, which are, I would think, a much more deliberate,
*  sober, measured action taken by professional prosecutors, particularly from the Department
*  of Justice.
*  And that effort to vindicate criminal law is different in kind, the Supreme Court has
*  suggested, than lawsuits for money.
*  Yeah, I mean, part of the difference is that obviously anyone can bring a lawsuit, but
*  not everyone can bring a criminal case against someone.
*  Exactly right.
*  Okay, but in the Nixon case, he's given immunity, you just said, in part because he was acting
*  in his official capacity.
*  I mean, my question is, is what Trump is accused of here reasonably considered part of his
*  official duties?
*  I mean, he's accused of seeking to overturn the election.
*  Is his team making the case that seeking to overturn the election was part of his job
*  as president?
*  That's what they say.
*  Not in those terms.
*  They wouldn't say that his job was to overturn the election.
*  They would say his job was to investigate claims of election misconduct by other people.
*  You know, responding to widespread allegations of fraud, abuse, and misfeasance in a presidential
*  election, trying to find how to respond to that, in a manner that's in the national interest.
*  And he did that, they say, maybe not very convincingly, in his official capacity and
*  not as a candidate seeking reelection.
*  This is a point of real vulnerability for Trump.
*  But the case as it reaches the appeals court is about whether he has absolute immunity
*  for all official conduct and not details about what is and is not official conduct.
*  And one of the judges, Judge Karen Henderson, makes the strong point that even official
*  conduct can be quite problematic.
*  I think it's paradoxical to say that his constitutional duty to take care that the
*  laws be faithfully executed allows him to violate criminal laws.
*  So is Trump's lawyer essentially making the argument that a president shouldn't be prosecuted
*  for anything he does in office?
*  I mean, at the end of the day, a crime is a crime, right?
*  Well the judges certainly seem to feel that way.
*  And they tested that question that you're asking, Natalie, with some wild hypotheticals.
*  And so in your view, could a president sell pardons or sell military secrets?
*  Those are official acts, right?
*  It's an official act to grant a pardon.
*  It's an official act to communicate with the foreign government.
*  And such a president would not be subject to criminal prosecution?
*  So they asked, well, what if the president was selling pardons?
*  What if he was selling military secrets?
*  Could a president order SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival?
*  That's an official act in order to seal Team 6?
*  What if he sent SEAL Team 6 off to assassinate a political rival?
*  He's the commander in chief.
*  He's allowed to send SEAL Team 6 off to do things.
*  But almost everybody would agree that it's a crime.
*  And Trump's lawyer didn't shy away from those hypotheticals.
*  And they did not get the answer that perhaps you would expect.
*  He would have to be and would speedily be, you know, impeached and convicted before the
*  criminal prosecution.
*  He said that the president is immune from criminal prosecution with one exception, could
*  only be prosecuted if he was first impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate for
*  that conduct.
*  And in that narrow circumstance, and only in that narrow circumstance, Trump's lawyer
*  said would a criminal prosecution be appropriate?
*  Let me get this straight.
*  He's saying the only way for a president to be prosecuted for ordering, say, the murder
*  of a political rival is if he's first impeached and convicted by the Senate for that crime.
*  That's, I mean, impeachment is a political process decided by partisan elected officials.
*  He's saying they decide whether the judiciary branch can prosecute crimes.
*  That's what he says the Constitution contemplates.
*  He says the Constitution contemplates a very strong president with a lot of room to maneuver,
*  subject to oversight by the House and Senate in the quite limited impeachment proceeding
*  process.
*  So I just want to confirm, your position is if President Trump had been convicted after
*  his impeachment trial on incitement of insurrection, if he'd been convicted, then this
*  prosecution would be entirely proper.
*  And Judge Florence Pan makes the point that even that construct is a little weird because
*  Trump is arguing he has absolute immunity in every circumstance, but he's just found
*  a circumstance in which he's not absolutely immune.
*  If there is impeachment by the House and conviction by the Senate, he can, he concedes, be prosecuted.
*  I would say that if you were impeached and convicted for the same and similar conduct,
*  then that would authorize a subsequent prosecution.
*  We have many other issues with this prosecution.
*  Is that a yes?
*  Because I think you said in your brief that that impeachment for incitement of insurrection
*  is based on the same or related conduct as that which is in the indictment.
*  Yes, yes, yeah, I agree with that.
*  So the notion of absolute immunity is not quite right.
*  Right.
*  It seems like this kind of negates the whole thing about how the president is immune from
*  prosecution if he's committing crimes in an official capacity.
*  I mean, Trump's lawyer is saying that if a president is convicted by Congress, he can
*  be prosecuted.
*  And he also seems to be saying if he's not impeached and convicted by Congress, he cannot
*  be prosecuted.
*  What should we make of that?
*  So it's not the only obvious reading of what lawyers call the impeachment judgment clause.
*  The impeachment judgment clause says that if you're impeached and convicted, the punishment
*  you get from Congress is no more than removal from office and possibly being banned from
*  holding office again.
*  And then there's a second part of the clause that says notwithstanding all that, you're
*  still subject to prosecution.
*  So if convicted, you're still subject to prosecution.
*  Trump reads that in a non-obvious way to say if not convicted, not subject to prosecution.
*  And that, you know, if you took logic in college, you might think that does not quite parse.
*  If the court has no further questions, we would ask the court to reverse.
*  And if the court rules against us in any respect, we renew our request of the court to stay
*  as mandate to allow us to seek further review.
*  Thank you, Your Honor.
*  So it sounds like the judges are pretty skeptical of the Trump argument here.
*  Yeah, all three judges have serious problems with major aspects of the arguments set out
*  by Trump's lawyer.
*  And they seem to be eager to see what the government has to say.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Adam, you just said the judges were eager to hear the Justice Department's case.
*  So how did that go?
*  How did the government lay out its case?
*  Good morning and may it please the court.
*  So James Pierce, Justice Department lawyer, a member of special counsel Jack Smith's team,
*  gets up and makes a general point.
*  Never in our nation's history until this case has a president claimed that immunity
*  from criminal prosecution extends beyond his time in office.
*  This is a case where a sitting president has tried to subvert an election.
*  At a minimum, this case, in which the defendant is alleged to have conspired to overturn the
*  results of a presidential election, is not the place to recognize some novel form of
*  criminal immunity.
*  He says that this is not the case in which you need to be making any kind of nuanced
*  or elaborate legal judgments.
*  And whatever can be said about official acts and immunity in some setting or not, this
*  fits squarely within the possibility of pursuing a criminal prosecution.
*  Okay, so what does the government's lawyer say specifically about Trump's arguments?
*  How does he respond?
*  Well he rejects, for instance, the idea that Trump's lawyers pressed that allowing this
*  prosecution would open the floodgates to all kinds of prosecutions of other presidents.
*  The careful investigations in the Clinton era didn't result in any charges.
*  The fact that this investigation did doesn't reflect that we are going to see a sea change
*  of vindictive tit-for-tat prosecutions in the future.
*  I think it reflects the fundamentally unprecedented nature of the criminal charges here.
*  Pointing out that we have lived in this republic for more than 200 years and not come across
*  anything remotely like this, and there's no reason to think we would see it again.
*  And he says that criminal proceedings are serious matters, constrained in many ways.
*  That is a process which has the kinds of safeguards that a couple of members of the court here
*  have already referred to.
*  We're talking about prosecutors who follow strict codes and...
*  Not only by prosecutors making hard calls about which cases to bring, but grand juries
*  doing the indicting, trial judges supervising the trial, juries hearing the case, an elaborate
*  appellate process.
*  That there are all kinds of checks in the system to make sure that any eventual conviction
*  is justly deserved.
*  I have to ask though, Adam, I mean, there is this widespread belief that while the criminal
*  justice system is not supposed to be politicized, while it's supposed to operate with the checks
*  and balances that the government's lawyer laid out, that in reality there are a lot
*  of political motivations behind some of these criminal cases.
*  And you know, maybe these safeguards aren't actually working.
*  Well, former President Trump supporters certainly believe that this prosecution and others are
*  politically motivated.
*  They point out that although there's a special counsel somewhat insulated from the Justice
*  Department, nonetheless, the person at the head of the current executive branch, President
*  Biden, is former President Trump's main political rival.
*  So it's not easy to convince people who are supportive of President Trump and skeptical
*  of this prosecution that there's no element of politics at play here.
*  Trump's lawyer raises the possibility that there could be a criminal prosecution, say
*  of Joe Biden, for failing to control the border adequately.
*  I'm not sure that's a crime.
*  But he raises the idea that one criminal prosecution of one former president will beget another
*  and open the floodgates in that way.
*  Okay.
*  And what about this question of acting in an official capacity and whether that confers
*  immunity?
*  What do the government's lawyers say about that?
*  The government's lawyer says that these two things are not mutually exclusive, that you
*  can be acting in an official capacity and you can be committing grave criminal wrongdoing.
*  The lawyer echoes the point from Judge Henderson.
*  I fully endorse or agree with the idea of the paradox of a president on the one hand
*  having the article to take care responsibility, and on the other hand, sort of seeing compliance
*  with the law is optional.
*  That there's an element of paradox about this, that your job is to execute the laws faithfully,
*  and yet you are violating a criminal law and you could be immune from that.
*  I mean, what kind of world are we living in if, as I understood my friend on the other
*  side to say here, a president orders his SEAL team to assassinate a political rival and
*  resigns, for example, before an impeachment, not a criminal act.
*  And then he returns to the example of the political assassination ordered up via SEAL
*  Team 6 and says that cannot be the case, that you are immune from prosecution for murdering
*  your political rivals unless Congress acts by impeachment and conviction.
*  I think that is extraordinarily frightening future and that is the kind of, we're talking
*  about a balancing and a weighing of the interest, I think that should weigh extraordinarily
*  heavily in the court's consideration.
*  And there's a brief rebuttal from Trump's lawyer, John Sauer, in which he makes the
*  case that the future is frightening, but for a different reason than the government says.
*  We are in a situation where we have the prosecution of the chief political opponent who is winning
*  in every poll and is being prosecuted by the administration that he's seeking to replace.
*  That is the frightening future that is tailor made to launch cycles of recrimination that
*  will shake our republic for the future.
*  It's interesting, there's these kind of two dueling visions of what the frightening future
*  that this case leads to actually is on either side.
*  It's the case of the dueling dystopias.
*  So Adam, what's going to happen here?
*  I mean, it seems like things didn't go that well for Trump in the courtroom today.
*  The judges don't seem to be leaning towards siding with him.
*  How does this end?
*  I think in very short order, this court is likely to rule against Donald Trump.
*  He will then either take his appeal to the full DC Circuit, not because he's likely to
*  win there, but because he has every incentive to delay and to burn up time.
*  And then to the US Supreme Court, which had earlier turned this case away.
*  Jack Smith, the special counsel, had asked the court to leapfrog the appeals court and
*  hear the case right away.
*  They wouldn't do that.
*  But they are more likely than not going to weigh in for at least two reasons.
*  One, if a question of this constitutional importance, the scope of presidential immunity
*  from criminal prosecution is going to be decided by a court, it probably ought to be the Supreme Court.
*  And second, because the court has already agreed to hear questions about Trump's eligibility
*  in Colorado and really around the nation, the court might like to have the option of
*  issuing one decision favoring Trump and one decision not.
*  And because this immunity argument is so ambitious and such a long shot, you might
*  think the Supreme Court would rule against Donald Trump in that case and perhaps find
*  a way to keep him eligible on the ballot in the other case.
*  You're saying the court might want to rule against Trump here so that they can preserve
*  the sense of balance when they rule in favor of him in the cases in Colorado and other
*  states where they're trying to get him off the ballot?
*  They would never admit to that.
*  They would probably not even have a conscious feeling about doing that.
*  But history is replete with days at the end of the term in June when liberals score a
*  big victory and conservatives score a big victory and it just happens to work out that way.
*  Now that's in an era where the court was more closely divided.
*  So all of this is speculation only, but it would not be shocking if the court trying
*  to maintain its reputation as itself an apolitical institution were to go one way in one case
*  and one way in the other.
*  Okay, you think this will end up at the Supreme Court, but my question is when?
*  And I'm asking because of course the timing of all of this is important.
*  Obviously there's an election, the Iowa caucus is next week.
*  I mean, you said part of the Trump strategy here is not just to gain immunity, but also
*  to delay the trial.
*  The trial continues to be scheduled for March 4th.
*  With each passing day, it makes it more likely it's going to slip.
*  Just getting a decision out, then getting a request to the full appeals court to hear
*  the case, then going to the Supreme Court, then the court either turning it away or hearing
*  arguments and deciding it.
*  All of that, even if done at a brisk pace by legal standards, will take weeks, if not
*  months.
*  And that's been one of Donald Trump's main legal strategies in this case and in other
*  cases to kick the can down the road, to slow things up.
*  And the more he can delay, the more options he has.
*  He may well lose at the appeals court, at the Supreme Court, and at the same time win
*  something very valuable for him, which is to get enough delay to lock in the nomination
*  of one of the two major political parties, even as he is accused of serious crimes.
*  Adam, thank you so much.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Tuesday, Walter Reed Medical Center revealed why Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin had
*  been hospitalized more than a week ago, a hospitalization Austin had concealed from
*  the public and the president in a breach of protocol that frustrated some in the Biden
*  administration.
*  Hospital officials said the Secretary of Defense was admitted on New Year's Day with severe
*  abdominal, hip and leg pain after undergoing a procedure for prostate cancer.
*  Officials said his condition has since improved and called his cancer prognosis, quote, excellent.
*  And in a court filing this week, a lawyer for one of the defendants charged alongside
*  former President Trump in the Georgia election interference case said that the district attorney
*  overseeing that case, Fannie Willis, had engaged in a, quote, clandestine relationship with
*  the special prosecutor she hired for that case.
*  The filing provided no proof of the relationship, but argued that it should disqualify the district
*  attorney and the special prosecutor from prosecuting the case.
