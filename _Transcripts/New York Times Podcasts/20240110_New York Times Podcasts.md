*  From the New York Times, this is the Daily. I'm Natalie Ketrowa.
*  Donald Trump has consistently argued that as former president, he's immune from being
*  charged with a crime for what he did in office.
*  Today, my colleague Adam Lipteck, on what happened when his lawyers made that case in federal
*  court, whether the extraordinary claim has any chance of being accepted, and why Trump may
*  win something valuable either way.
*  It's Wednesday, January 10th.
*  Adam, hi. Welcome back to the show.
*  Hello.
*  So, Trump and his lawyers appeared in a federal appeals court Tuesday to make their case that,
*  as a former president, Trump is immune from criminal prosecution. Basically, the Justice Department
*  cannot charge him for a criminal act, which if Trump wins, seems like it would make a lot
*  of his legal troubles go away. Is that right?
*  Yeah, it's an extraordinary ask. He says he has absolute immunity from criminal prosecution
*  for anything resembling an official act while he was president, even after he's no longer
*  president.
*  Adam, can you take us back, just explain how we got here?
*  Well, the criminal case against former president Trump, I say the criminal case, the criminal
*  case we care about today, because it's one of four, is a federal indictment brought
*  by special counsel, Jack Smith, arising from Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
*  So that charges filed in federal district, court in Washington, and among Trump's responses
*  is to file a motion, saying, you can't prosecute me because I have immunity from criminal
*  prosecution for my official acts when I was president. And the trial judge considers
*  that motion and rules against Donald Trump says, we have presidents not kings, and you're
*  responsible for criminal conduct. If the prosecution can prove it, Trump appeals. It goes to
*  a three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit of Federal
*  Appeals Court in Washington. Oh, yay, oh, yay, oh, yay.
*  And they heard a very lively argument today, all persons having business before the honorable,
*  the United States Court of Appeals for the district of Columbia Circuit are in managed
*  to draw near and give their attention. So you said this was an extraordinary ask by the
*  former president to be granted absolute immunity. Tell me about the Trump argument here. Why
*  would he be immune? Mr. Sauer, where the imbalance, Mr. Pierce, where the epileee.
*  Sauer, good morning. Well, 9.30 Tuesday morning, his lawyer, John Sauer, steps up to the
*  lectern, addresses the three judge panel and makes an aggressive argument.
*  If a president has to look over his shoulder or her shoulder every time he hears she has
*  to make a controversial decision. And worry after I leave office, am I going to jail for
*  this? When my political opponents take power, that inevitably dampens the ability of the
*  president. He says a president is the head of one of the three branches of government.
*  And that gives him special power and special immunity from prosecution that we can't have
*  our presidents distracted when they're trying to make tough decisions. To authorize the
*  prosecution of a president for his official acts would open a Pandora's box from which
*  this nation may never recover. And he says allowing criminal prosecutions would open up
*  a Pandora's box of criminal actions taken against former presidents of all kinds for all
*  sorts of things.
*  But George W. Bush be prosecuted for obstruction of an official proceeding for allegedly giving
*  false information to Congress to induce the nation to go to war in Iraq under false
*  pretenses. Could President Obama be potentially charged with murder for allegedly authorizing
*  drone strikes targeting U.S. citizens located abroad?
*  So he's saying that there could be this flood of prosecutions and that presidents need
*  to be able to operate without fear of that. That it could be dangerous to the public good.
*  It could interfere with the president's ability to execute his duties.
*  Yes. And there's a logic to that, Natalie. We don't want our presidents distracted.
*  We want them to be able to make smart decisions in real time about very difficult questions
*  without looking over their shoulders without being afraid of prosecution. And the Supreme
*  Court has in a limited way endorsed this idea in a case from 1982 called Nixon V Fitzgerald
*  when President Richard Nixon was a former president. He was being sued by a whistleblower who
*  said that Nixon had unfairly dismissed him. And the court says we can't have constant lawsuits
*  against even former presidents because that would make their day jobs really difficult
*  when they're thinking about am I going to be sued for something? And therefore by a
*  five to four vote in the context of civil litigation where people are seeking money, private
*  parties seeking money, not criminal conduct. The Supreme Court says yes. The president
*  has absolute immunity from being sued for money up to the outer perimeter of his official
*  conduct. But that's one category. Law suits for money or one category. And the Supreme
*  Court has spoken to that. It hasn't directly spoken to criminal prosecutions, which are
*  I would think a much more deliberate sober measured action taken by professional prosecutors,
*  particularly from the Department of Justice. And that effort to vindicate criminal law is
*  different in kind. The Supreme Court has suggested then lawsuits for money. Yeah, I mean,
*  part of the difference is that obviously anyone can bring a lawsuit, but not everyone can
*  bring a criminal case against someone. Exactly right. Okay. But in the Nixon case, he's
*  given immunity, you just said, in part because he was acting in his official capacity.
*  I mean, my question is, is what Trump is accused of here reasonably considered part of his
*  official duties? I mean, he's accused of seeking to overturn the election. Is his team
*  making the case that seeking to overturn the election was part of his job as president?
*  That's what they say. Not in those terms. They wouldn't say that his job was to overturn
*  the election. They would say his job was to investigate claims of election misconduct
*  by other people, you know, responding to widespread allegations of fraud, abuse and misfeasons
*  in the presidential election, trying to find out a respond to that and mayor that's
*  the national interest. And he did that. They say maybe not very convincingly in his official
*  capacity and not as a candidate seeking reelection. This is a point of real vulnerability
*  for Trump. But the case as it reaches the appeals court is about whether he has absolute
*  immunity for all official conduct and not details about what is and is not official
*  conduct. And one of the judges judge Karen Henderson makes the strong point that even official
*  conduct can be quite problematic. I think it's paradoxical to say that his constitutional
*  duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed allows him to violate criminal laws.
*  So is Trump's lawyer essentially making the argument that a president shouldn't be
*  prosecuted for anything he does in office? I mean, at the end of the day, a crime is a
*  crime, right? Well, the judges certainly seem to feel that way. And they tested that
*  question that you're asking Natalie with some wild hypotheticals. And so in your view,
*  could a president sell partings or sell military secrets? Those are official acts, right?
*  It's an official act to grant a pardon. It's an official act to communicate with the foreign
*  government. And such a president would not be subject to criminal prosecution. So they
*  asked, well, what if the president was selling partings? What if he was selling military
*  secrets? Could a president order seal team six to assassinate a political rival? That's
*  an official act in order to seal team six. What if he sent seal team six off to assassinate
*  a political rival? He's the commander in chief. He's allowed to send seal team six off
*  to do things. But almost everybody would agree that it's a crime. And Trump's lawyer didn't
*  shy away from those hypotheticals. And they did not get the answer that perhaps you would
*  expect. He would have to be and would speedily be impeached and convicted before the criminal
*  prosecution. He said that the president is immune from criminal prosecution with one
*  exception could only be prosecuted if he was first impeached by the house and convicted
*  by the Senate for that conduct. And in that narrow circumstance, and only in that narrow
*  circumstance, Trump's lawyer said, would a criminal prosecution be appropriate?
*  Let me get this straight. He's saying the only way for a president to be prosecuted for
*  ordering, say, the murder of a political rival is if he's first impeached and convicted
*  by the Senate for that crime. That's, I mean, impeachment is a political process decided
*  by partisan elected officials. He's saying they decide whether the judiciary branch can
*  prosecute crimes. That's what he says, the Constitution contemplates. He says the Constitution
*  contemplates a very strong president with a lot of room to maneuver subject to oversight
*  by the House and Senate in the quite limited impeachment proceeding process.
*  So I just want to confirm your position is if President Trump had been convicted after
*  his impeachment trial on incitement of insurrection, if he'd been convicted, then this prosecution
*  would be entirely proper. And Judge Florence Pan makes the point that even that construct
*  is a little weird because Trump is arguing he has absolute immunity in every circumstance,
*  but he's just found a circumstance in which he's not absolutely immune. If there is impeachment
*  by the House and conviction by the Senate, he can, he concedes be prosecuted.
*  Uh, I would say that if you were impeached and convicted for the same and similar conduct,
*  then that would authorize a subsequent prosecution. We said we had many other issues with this execution.
*  Is that a yeah? Because I think you said in your brief that that impeachment for incitement
*  of insurrection is based on the same or related conduct as that, which is in the indictment.
*  Yes, yes, I agree with that. So the notion of absolute immunity is not quite right.
*  Right. It seems like this kind of negates the whole thing about how the president is immune
*  from prosecution if he's committing crimes in an official capacity. I mean, Trump's lawyer is saying
*  that if a president is convicted by Congress, he can be prosecuted. And he also seems to be saying,
*  if he's not impeached and convicted by Congress, he cannot be prosecuted. What should we make of that?
*  So it's not the only obvious reading of what lawyers call the impeachment judgment clause.
*  The impeachment judgment clause says that if you're impeached and convicted, the punishment you get
*  from Congress is no more than removal from office and possibly being banned from holding office
*  again. And then there's a second part of the clause that says, notwithstanding all that,
*  you're still subject to prosecution. So if convicted, you're still subject to prosecution,
*  Trump reads that in a non-obvious way to say, if not convicted, not subject to prosecution.
*  And that, you know, if you took logic in college, you might think that's not quite part.
*  If the court is no further questions, we would ask the court to reverse.
*  And if the court rules against us in any respect, we renew our request.
*  The court stay its mandate to allow us to seek for the review. Thank you, Your Honor.
*  So it sounds like the judges are pretty skeptical of the Trump argument here.
*  Yeah, all three judges have serious problems with major aspects of the argument set out by
*  Trump's lawyer and they seem to be eager to see what the government has to say.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Adam, you just said the judges were eager to hear the Justice Department's case.
*  So how did that go? How did the government lay out its case?
*  Good morning and may it please the court.
*  So James Pierce, Justice Department lawyer, a member of Special Counsel Jack Smith's team
*  gets up and makes a general point.
*  Never in our nation's history tell this case as a president claimed that immunity and criminal
*  prosecution extends beyond his time office. This is a case where a sitting president
*  has tried to subvert an election. At a minimum, this case in which the defendant is alleged to
*  have conspired to overturn the results of a presidential election is not the place to recognize
*  some novel form of criminal immunity. He says that this is not the case in which you need to be
*  making any kind of nuance to elaborate legal judgments and whatever can be said about official acts
*  and immunity in some setting or not. He is not above the law.
*  This fits squarely within the possibility of pursuing a criminal prosecution.
*  Okay, so what does the government's lawyer say specifically about Trump's arguments? How does he
*  respond? Well, he rejects, for instance, the idea that Trump's lawyers pressed that allowing
*  this prosecution would open the floodgates to all kinds of prosecutions of other presidents.
*  The careful investigations in the Clinton era didn't result in any charges. The fact that
*  this investigation did doesn't reflect that we are going to see a sea change of
*  vindictive tit for tat prosecutions in the future. I think it reflects the fundamentally
*  unprecedented nature of the criminal charges here. Pointing out that we have lived in this
*  republic for more than 200 years and not come across anything remotely like this, and there's
*  no reason to think we would see it again. And he says that criminal proceedings are
*  serious matters constrained in many ways. That is a process which has the kinds of safeguards
*  that a couple of members of the court here have already referred to. We're talking about
*  prosecutors who follow strict codes and not only by prosecutors making hard calls about which case
*  is to bring, but grand juries doing the inditing, trial judges supervising the trial, juries
*  hearing the case, an elaborate appellate process, that there are all kinds of checks in the system
*  to make sure that any eventual conviction is justly deserved.
*  I have to ask, though, Adam. I mean, there is this widespread belief that while the criminal
*  justice system is not supposed to be politicized, while it's supposed to operate with the checks
*  and balances that the government's lawyer laid out, that in reality, there are a lot of political
*  motivations behind some of these criminal cases. And, you know, maybe these safeguards aren't
*  actually working. Well, former president Trump supporters certainly believe that this prosecution
*  and others are politically motivated. They point out that although there's a special counsel
*  somewhat insulated from the Justice Department, nonetheless, the person at the head of the current
*  executive branch, President Biden, is former president Trump's main political rival. So it's not
*  easy to convince people who are supportive of President Trump and skeptical of this prosecution
*  that there's no element of politics at play here. And Trump's lawyer raises the possibility that
*  there could be a criminal prosecution, say, of Joe Biden, for failing to control the border
*  adequately. I'm not sure that's a crime, but he raises the idea that one criminal prosecution
*  of one former president will be get another and open the floodgates in that way.
*  Okay. And what about this question of acting in an official capacity and whether that confers
*  immunity? What do the government's lawyers say about that? The government's lawyer says that
*  these two things are not mutually exclusive. That you can be acting in an official capacity
*  and you can be committing grave criminal wrongdoing. The lawyer echoes the point from Judge Henderson.
*  I fully endorse or agree with the idea of the paradox of a president on the one hand having the
*  article to take care responsibility. And on the other hand, sort of seeing compliance with the law
*  is optional. That there's an element of paradox about this, that your job is to execute the laws
*  faithfully. And yet you are violating a criminal law. And you could be immune from that.
*  I mean, what kind of world are we living in if, as I understood my friend on the other side
*  to say here, a president orders his seal team to assassinate a political rival and resigns, for
*  example, before an impeachment, not a criminal act. And then he returns to the example of the political
*  assassination ordered up via seal team six and says that cannot be the case. That you are immune
*  from prosecution for murdering your political rivals unless Congress acts my impeachment in
*  conviction. I think that is extraordinarily frightening future. And that is the kind of we're
*  talking about a balancing and a weighing of the interest. I think that should weigh extraordinarily
*  heavily in the court's consideration. And there's a brief rebuttal from Crump's lawyer, John Sauer,
*  in which he makes the case that the future is frightening. But for a different reason
*  than the government says. If we are in a situation where we have the prosecution of the chief
*  political opponent who is winning in every poll and is being prosecuted by the administration that
*  he's seeking to replace, that is the frightening future. That is tailor made to launch cycles of
*  recrimination that will shake our republic for the future. It's interesting. There's these kind of
*  two dueling visions of what the frightening future that this case leads to actually is on either side.
*  It's the case of the dueling dystopias.
*  So Adam, what's going to happen here? I mean, it seems like things didn't go that well for Trump
*  in the courtroom today. The judges don't seem to be leaning towards siding with him. How does
*  this end? I think in very short order, this court is likely to rule against Donald Trump.
*  He will then either take his appeal to the full DC Circuit, not because he's likely to win there,
*  but because he has every incentive to delay and to burn up time. And then to the US Supreme Court,
*  which had earlier turned this case away. Jack Smith, the special counsel, had asked the court
*  to leapfrog the appeals court. In here, the case right away, they wouldn't do that. But they are
*  more likely than they're not going away in for at least two reasons. One, if a question of this
*  constitutional importance, the scope of presidential immunity from criminal prosecution is going to be
*  decided by a court, it probably ought to be the Supreme Court. And second, because the court is
*  already agreed to hear questions about Trump's eligibility in Colorado and really around the
*  nation, the court might like to have the option of issuing one decision, favoring Trump and one
*  decision, not. And because this immunity argument is so ambitious and such a long shot, you might
*  think the Supreme Court would rule against Donald Trump in that case and perhaps find a way to keep
*  him eligible on the ballot in the other case. You're saying the court might want to rule against
*  Trump here so that they can preserve the sense of balance when they rule in favor of him in the
*  cases in Colorado and other states where they're trying to get him off the ballot? They would never
*  admit to that. They would probably not even have a conscious feeling about doing that. But history
*  is replete with days at the end of the term in June when liberal scorer big victory and
*  conservative scorer big victory. And it just happens to work out that way. Now that's in an era
*  where the court was more closely divided. So all of this is speculation only. But it would not be
*  shocking if the court trying to maintain its reputation as itself an apolitical institution.
*  Where to go one way in one case and one way in the other. Okay, you think this will end up
*  with the Supreme Court. But my question is when? And I'm asking because of course the timing of
*  all of this is important. Obviously there's an election the Iowa caucus is next week. I mean,
*  you said part of the Trump strategy here is not just to gain immunity, but also to delay the trial.
*  The trial continues to be scheduled for March 4th. With each passing day, it makes it more
*  likely it's going to slip. Just getting a decision out. Then getting a request to the full
*  appeals court to hear the case. Then going to the Supreme Court. Then the court either turning it
*  away or hearing arguments and deciding it. All of that, even if done at a brisk pace by legal standards
*  will take weeks if not months. And that's been one of Donald Trump's main legal strategies in
*  this case and in other cases to kick the can down the road to slow things up.
*  And the more he can delay, the more options he has.
*  He may well lose at the appeals court, at the Supreme Court, and at the same time win something
*  very valuable for him, which is to get enough delay to lock in the nomination of one of the two
*  major political parties, even as he is accused of serious crimes.
*  Adam, thank you so much. Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what I'll see you need to know today. On Tuesday, Walter Reed Medical Center revealed why
*  Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin had been hospitalized more than a week ago. A hospitalization
*  Austin had concealed from the public and the president in a breach of protocol that frustrated some
*  in the Biden administration. Hospital officials said the Secretary of Defense was admitted on New
*  Year's Day with severe abdominal hip and leg pain after undergoing a procedure for prostate cancer.
*  Official said his condition has since improved and called his cancer prognosis, quote, excellent.
*  And in a court filing this week, a lawyer for one of the defendants charged alongside former
*  president Trump in the Georgia election interference case said that the district attorney overseeing that
*  case, Fannie Willis, had engaged in a quote, clandestine relationship with the special prosecutor she
*  hired for that case. The filing provided no proof of the relationship, but argued that it should
*  disqualify the district attorney and the special prosecutor from prosecuting the case.
