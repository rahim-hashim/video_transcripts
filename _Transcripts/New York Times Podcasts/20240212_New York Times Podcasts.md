*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernice, and this is The Daily.
*  Questions of Swirl for Weeks.
*  Over what went wrong on an Alaska Airlines flight, where a piece of the plane blew out into
*  the sky, terrifying passengers, and renewing concerns about the plane's manufacturer, Boeing.
*  Last week in Washington, we started to get some answers.
*  Today, my colleague, Sydney Ember, explains.
*  It's Monday, February 12.
*  Sydney, welcome to the show.
*  Hi.
*  Hi.
*  Sydney, last month, there was this terrifying incident on an Alaska Airlines flight.
*  A door fell off the plane while it was in mid-air, and since then, there's been this
*  kind of laundry list of unanswered questions about what went wrong, and ultimately, who
*  was responsible for that?
*  And so last week, we started to get some of our first clear answers.
*  But let's start with the accident itself.
*  Walk us through what happened.
*  So, Boeing has been under the microscope for about five years after two crashes in late
*  2018 and early 2019, killed nearly 350 people, and these planes, which are Boeing 737, Max
*  8 planes.
*  Important plane for Boeing and for airlines in the United States, right?
*  Extremely important.
*  This had become one of Boeing's best-selling planes.
*  You know, it was flying all around the world, and these crashes cost Boeing billions of dollars,
*  and it vowed to make the Max 8 much, much safer.
*  But then, this incident in January happens.
*  This time with a Max 9.
*  On January 5, Alaska Airlines flight 1282 takes off from Portland International Airport
*  heading to Ontario, California, and about 10 minutes after takeoff at about 16,000
*  feet.
*  We're just here, a big bow.
*  There's a loud bang.
*  It was silent for like one second, and then it would just feel and hear a lot of air
*  going around, freezing pool of air.
*  The plane rattles, the oxygen masks drop, lights flicker.
*  So at first I thought it was just the window, and then I realized it was the whole panel.
*  Passengers start realizing there's a giant hole now in the plane.
*  Maybe nature of the emergency and your intentions.
*  Seattle, Alaska.
*  Flav'ing, June, just to cut the airboard, the final emergency, we can't even get a send-down.
*  God, that is terrifying.
*  Yeah, this is a really, really scary moment for a lot of passengers.
*  I think a lot of them are thinking the worst.
*  And...
*  The pilots eventually make an emergency landing back in Portland.
*  And what had happened was a panel called a door plug.
*  That panel had fallen off the plane essentially.
*  There are no serious injuries, but it could have been catastrophic if this had happened
*  at cruising altitude, roughly 30,000 feet, or higher up, especially if passengers hadn't
*  been wearing their seat belts or if people had been moving around as they often are when planes
*  get up to cruising altitude.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  So really kind of miraculous that no one was actually hurt.
*  I mean, they were pretty close to getting into a zone where there could have been some
*  pretty serious injuries.
*  So what's the reaction to this?
*  I mean, decide from the obvious terror of the passengers.
*  Well, the question immediately is who is to blame?
*  Is it Alaska Airlines?
*  Is it Boeing?
*  Is it Spirit Air Systems?
*  Which built the body of the plane and then shipped it to Boeing's factory in Renton, Washington?
*  Is it the FAA and Federal Regulators?
*  No one really knows in the immediate aftermath.
*  And as these questions are swirling, what happens almost immediately is the Federal Aviation
*  Administration, the main regulator for airlines, grounds, maxine planes with this door plug.
*  So it amounts to about 170 maxine planes in this country.
*  Got it.
*  And that seems like a lot, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, the two airlines in the United States that fly maxines at this point are just Alaska
*  and United Airlines.
*  But these are sizable portions of their fleet.
*  Alaska has 65 maxines and United has 79, the most of any US carrier at this point.
*  So this snorls their schedules, pilots and flight attendants can't get to their next
*  destination.
*  They can't get home because the planes that they were supposed to fly on have been grounded.
*  So it's a sizable number of planes that are doing a lot of work and this becomes a big
*  problem for those airlines.
*  And what do the airlines themselves say?
*  I mean, specifically Alaska Airlines, perhaps.
*  These are Boeing's customers, right?
*  How do they respond to this?
*  Well, airline CEOs come out pretty forcefully blaming Boeing.
*  I'm more than frustrated and disappointed.
*  The Alaska airline CEO, I am angry.
*  He says I am angry.
*  My demand on Boeing is what are they going to do to improve their quality programs in
*  house and then in addition?
*  This echoes what a lot of CEOs say they want to hold Boeing accountable.
*  They're really frustrated with Boeing itself.
*  And near the end of January, something else happens that puts some more pressure on
*  the airlines that ramps up the frustration even more, the FAA takes further action and
*  orders Boeing to limit its planned increase in production of all of its 737 max planes.
*  And help you understand what that means.
*  So the federal government is saying you can't make this plane anymore, basically.
*  The federal government is limiting how many planes Boeing can make.
*  And this effectively limits how many planes they can produce a year.
*  So they can focus on safety.
*  At the end of the year, they said they were making about 38 planes a month and they had
*  hoped to increase that to 42 planes a month this year and further increase that in 2025.
*  But this really limits that for the foreseeable future and possibly for many months.
*  I mean, the federal government is effectively saying we don't trust you to make this plane
*  properly.
*  It basically says you cannot ramp up your production until you've proven to us that
*  you've resolved your quality control issues.
*  But even with these limits on production, the FAA still clears the previously grounded
*  max-9s after inspections and after their deum-save to fly.
*  OK, but at this point, you know, a lot of fingers are pointing at Boeing, but we still
*  don't actually know the answer for who's responsible for this door blowout.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  We still don't know who is at fault, but in early February, things get worse for Boeing.
*  Boeing says that a supplier found two mistri-ld holes on max planes.
*  And this was going to cause them to have to rework about 50 planes and potentially delay
*  delivery of those planes as well.
*  Boeing sort of got ahead of this and announcing it, but it's still painting a picture of something
*  is a miss with Boeing and their quality control.
*  Which brings us to last week when all of this ends up in Washington.
*  That's right.
*  On Tuesday morning, there is a house hearing with the FAA's administrator, Mike Whitaker.
*  And he says they're going to increase their on-the-ground presence in monitoring Boeing's
*  manufacturing, but he doesn't face the kind of grilling about Boeing that I think some
*  thought or hoped he might.
*  The National Transportation Safety Board has released new information on the Alaska Airlines
*  plane that lost a door panel.
*  The real bombshell comes later in the day when the National Transportation Safety Board
*  releases its preliminary report on the incident.
*  It doesn't have the full accounting of everything, but it is our first official snapshot of what
*  happened.
*  What does it say?
*  What's in the report?
*  Four bolts like this one hold the door plug into the side of the 737 max nine.
*  They're two at the top and two at the bottom.
*  As reports says, there are two pairs of bolts on the door plug that was supposed to help
*  hold the plug in place on the plane's body.
*  That's critical information as the NTSB tries to determine why that door plug blew out.
*  It appears it simply wasn't at all connected properly to the fuselage itself.
*  They weren't there.
*  Wow.
*  It says that the bolts were there when the plane arrived at Boeing's Renton facility
*  in Washington, but that there had been an issue that was flagged.
*  There were damaged rivets near the door plug.
*  And in order to fix these rivets, the door plug had to be opened.
*  And so it was opened at Boeing's facility.
*  And somewhere in that process, it was put back together and there were no bolts put back.
*  That seems like a pretty bad oversight.
*  Yeah.
*  And the NTSB is pretty careful not to say who exactly did this.
*  They don't say who opened the door plug or who removed the bolts.
*  But what is clear is this happened at Boeing's facility in Renton, Washington.
*  And that pins the blame on Boeing.
*  Even Boeing itself would say this happened on our manufacturing floor.
*  We should be held accountable.
*  So all of this starts to give us the answer to what happened.
*  But we still don't know how this happened.
*  We're still at Boeing, a company that's already been under scrutiny after the two crashes
*  of its back splints.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Okay, so Sydney, we now know the what happened, roughly, more or less.
*  But we do not know the answer of how, right?
*  This broader mystery.
*  How could this have happened again at Boeing?
*  So help us unpack that.
*  Well, there are still truly more questions than answers.
*  But one of the things this incident did was raise more questions about the relationship
*  between Boeing and its regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration.
*  In the aftermath of two crashes in five months, US lawmakers grilled the Federal Aviation
*  Administration about its relationship with Boeing.
*  What we learned after the crashes in 2018 and 2019 was this relationship was really complicated.
*  A problem with software caused the planes to repeatedly nose dive when it was meant to
*  stabilize the aircraft.
*  Those crashes were caused by a flaw in a new software that was supposed to help stabilize
*  the planes.
*  An independent investigation has found the FAA itself was not fully aware of a new system
*  on the plane and the FAA delegated a high percentage of approvals allowing Boeing to certify
*  much of its own work.
*  The FAA handed Boeing the responsibility for determining the safety of that system and
*  basically delegated regulatory authority to Boeing.
*  Like Fox guarding the henhouse type thing.
*  Exactly.
*  But there is a reason for this.
*  The FAA has limited resources and they don't have enough people to have enough inspectors
*  on the ground themselves.
*  And also building an airplane is really hard and the people who know how to do it the
*  best and who know how the plane works the best are the Boeing engineers and Boeing employees
*  who built it.
*  But this doesn't change the fact that there were actually very few FAA inspectors at
*  Boeing's facility.
*  Just a small handful compared to the more than 10,000 employees who worked in Renton.
*  So even before the crashes, Boeing employees were starting to blow the whistle about this.
*  Saying the relationship between Boeing and the FAA could cause safety issues.
*  I mean, this is a really hard problem, right?
*  I used to write about the drug industry and the food and drug administration and it was
*  the same thing there.
*  You know, a small tiny handful of inspectors for drug companies with thousands of people.
*  Very difficult to actually police the things when you're the federal government, you're
*  potentially underfunded, like the federal inspectors to some extent are totally outgunned.
*  But there were supposed to be a whole reckoning after those earlier crashes, right?
*  There were lessons that had been drawn at that point about the dangers of this Fox guarding
*  the handhouse.
*  What happened?
*  Did anything change?
*  There were some changes after the crashes in 2018 and 2019.
*  The FAA took back the authority to determine whether Boeing planes were safe to fly.
*  And so now it's the FAA who determines the airworthiness of Boeing planes.
*  There were also some other steps that both Boeing and the FAA took to ensure that this system
*  where the FAA delegates some of the authority for inspections to Boeing works better.
*  And then in the immediate aftermath of the incident in January of this year, the FAA did
*  start putting more inspectors at Boeing's facility in Renton.
*  In fact, the FAA administrator said he put 20 additional inspectors.
*  Still, this is not a huge number of inspectors, but you can see how there would be criticism
*  that the FAA itself doesn't have enough people overseeing Boeing as it should.
*  Okay, so federal inspectors are clearly very outgunned.
*  But in this case, as we've said, Boeing is really front and center.
*  This incident happened at the Boeing factory.
*  So my question, I guess, is the same as I had for the federal regulators when it comes
*  to what's different from those past years?
*  What changed at Boeing after those big crashes?
*  Well, after the crashes in 2018 and 2019, a lot of blame was put on this cultural shift
*  that occurred at Boeing in the 1990s when there was a merger between Boeing and another
*  airplane manufacturer, McDonald Douglas.
*  And what a lot of people will say is the culture at Boeing shifted from an emphasis on engineering
*  to an emphasis on profits and shareholders.
*  And this is a criticism that you'll hear a lot, especially from old timers at Boeing
*  or former Boeing employees.
*  So after the crashes, Boeing did make a handful of changes.
*  Its whole leadership changed.
*  Its CEO was fired and the company brought on new board members who had engineering and
*  safety expertise.
*  And that was, of course, back then, right after those twin crashes in 2018 and 2019.
*  What are they saying now about those measures?
*  So they're very clearly saying that all of the changes they implemented after the crashes
*  were not enough that this incident on January 5th indicates that they need to still do a
*  lot more.
*  And so they've done a few things.
*  One of the things they've done is they said they would make changes to the quality control
*  processes.
*  And that includes at its own factory and also at its suppliers factory, at spirit aerosystems.
*  And then one of the biggest things they did was when they announced their earnings for
*  the fourth quarter, they suspended their financial guidance for the year, essentially saying this
*  was not the time to focus on financial performance.
*  It was a time to focus on safety.
*  So a few moves here by Boeing and healthy dose of PR, it sounds like to convince its customers,
*  you know, the airlines that it's actually focused on safety.
*  And did the customers believe it?
*  So that's still a little unclear.
*  Some of the airline customers have said publicly that they're sending their own inspectors
*  to Boeing's facility to monitor the manufacturing process.
*  But at least one CEO, the CEO of United Airlines, has suggested that he might move his business
*  elsewhere to another plane maker like Airbus.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Okay.
*  So that seems quite significant.
*  You know, that customers would potentially be voting with their feet and going to a competitor.
*  Is there any chance that this could actually be existential for Boeing?
*  Like that airlines will really start giving their business to Boeing's big competitor?
*  I think that's still a really open question.
*  I mean, remember Boeing is an American juggernaut.
*  It's a really important company for the American economy.
*  And also there are only two real airplane companies that make these planes.
*  There is Boeing and there's Airbus.
*  And it's a very complicated process to change how you're going to design your fleets and
*  to pivot if you're unhappy.
*  These planes take a while to make and a while to deliver.
*  You know, Airbus can't possibly make all of the planes and neither can Boeing.
*  So I don't think this is going to be an existential crisis for Boeing at this point.
*  But I think there is mounting frustration.
*  There is the sense of disbelief that you had five years to improve these really catastrophic
*  crashes happened.
*  You vowed to do better.
*  Everyone vowed to do better.
*  And yet here we are again.
*  And so I do think Boeing has a lot of questions that needs to answer and a lot of reassurance
*  that needs to give customers.
*  So Sydney, I'm going to ask you the question that probably a lot of our listeners will have
*  at this point.
*  And that is, should I be worried about flying on one of these planes?
*  I think this is a question that's front and center for a lot of people right now.
*  But the fact is you have to remember that flying is incredibly, incredibly safe.
*  There hasn't been a fatal accident involving a major US airline in more than a decade.
*  Oh wow.
*  You're actually statistically more likely to die in a car accident on the way to the airport
*  than you are on the plane.
*  So it is really, really safe to fly.
*  But I think the fact that you're asking this and others are asking this really could be
*  a problem for Boeing and really suggest that Boeing needs to solve the safety problems
*  it's having.
*  Sydney, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what you should know today.
*  Over the weekend, Democrats went on the defensive to discredit what they said was a partisan hit
*  on President Biden by special counsel Robert Herr.
*  This is a report that went off the rails, a chappy work product.
*  Bob Bauer, the president's personal lawyer, said on CBS face the nation that the report
*  was substandard.
*  And so along with the legal conclusion comes this flood of characterizations, factual
*  misstagement, pejorative comments about the president that are inconsistent with DOJ
*  policy and norms.
*  Her report issued last week, cleared Biden of wrongdoing in his handling of classified
*  documents, but characterized him as elderly and forgetful.
*  The report put a spotlight on what was already a primary concern for voters, Biden's age.
*  In a New York Times, CNN college poll this fall, more than 70 percent of battleground
*  state voters agreed that Biden was too old to be an effective president.
*  And, at a rally in South Carolina, former president Donald Trump claimed that while he was
*  in office, he told leaders of NATO countries that he would encourage Russia to quote, do
*  whatever the hell they want to countries that he deemed to be in a rears to the alliance.
*  You got to pay your bills.
*  It was an extraordinary claim, suggesting that he was threatening to incite an enemy to
*  attack American allies and foreshadowed what could be far-reaching changes in the international
*  order if he wins the White House.
