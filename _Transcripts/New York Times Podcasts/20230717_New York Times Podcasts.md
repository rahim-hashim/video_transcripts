*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernici, and this is The Daily.
*  This is the Chinese Dream.
*  The place we used to call red China has embraced capitalism with
*  vengeance and it's going all out.
*  The last three decades China has transformed itself into an economic powerhouse.
*  For decades, China's economy was the envy of the world, with an unbroken streak of
*  explosive growth.
*  It's turned out to China after three years of country is re-opening its borders and saying
*  goodbye to a zero-covid policy, so will this easy and the unleashing of the Chinese
*  consumer help bolster the economy around the world?
*  The pandemic broke that streak, but it was expected to come roaring back.
*  Instead, China's economy has faltered.
*  But the country is now experiencing some evidence of an economic downturn.
*  So now, even as COVID is starting to fade away, investors are left with this problem.
*  That China's economy is looking like it's going to be dragging for quite a while.
*  Today, my colleague, Asia Business Correspondent, Dai Waka Bayashi, on why China's economic
*  rebound hit a wall?
*  And what it says about the country's next chapter.
*  It's Monday, July 17th.
*  Dai, welcome to the show.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  So, Dai, I've been seeing a lot of headlines recently about China's economy, namely that
*  it's sputtering, which is really surprising to me because my image of China's economy
*  is kind of this galloping stallion of growth, like for years and years and years.
*  So, you're an expert.
*  Tell me what's going on with China's economy.
*  Yeah, I think that's been most people's perception, and it's because it has been.
*  For the last three decades, China has been an incredible growth driver.
*  Its economy has grown by leaps and bounds.
*  The country has lifted itself out of poverty.
*  And what we have come to expect is that China just kind of continues to be bigger and
*  bigger and bigger.
*  But then, COVID hit, and China imposed these tough restrictions, limiting sort of the
*  ability of its people to move, travel, go out and shop and spend money in the economy.
*  And so, when China actually lifted those measures in late 2022, the expectation was that the
*  economy would come really roaring back.
*  But what we saw was, after sort of an initial blip of activity, it hasn't really come back.
*  So, it didn't come roaring back.
*  So, what did you start to see?
*  So, China came out and said that it expects that GDP will be around 5% growth this year.
*  And a lot of economists saw that as a conservative estimate, something that was easily attainable.
*  But as sort of the economic conditions has worsened in the last few months, people are starting
*  to think that that might be just right on target and that perhaps it might even go lower than
*  that.
*  Which of course is so much lower than what it had been in earlier years.
*  Exactly.
*  And, you know, we saw at the sort of heyday growing by double digits, and certainly in the sort
*  of late 2010s, you know, the economy was growing 7-8% a year.
*  And so, even 5% feels like a rapid pullback.
*  And if it goes even below that, I think it's considered that, you know, the economy has
*  really started to slow down.
*  Okay.
*  So, big change going on here, China not growing nearly as fast as it used to.
*  Why isn't it rebounding?
*  What's happening, Dai?
*  Yeah.
*  So, Marina, I see sort of three things that really stand out.
*  One is that there's a real estate crash that's happening, and real estate is an important
*  part of the economy.
*  Another thing I see is that there's this sentiment amongst foreign businesses, foreign investors
*  that China is no longer a really safe place to invest.
*  And part of that is driven by sort of the measures that the government has put in place.
*  Okay.
*  So, let's start with the first driver of this slump that you ticked off, real estate.
*  So, what's happened there?
*  So, in China, real estate is the biggest sector in the economy.
*  Some people say it counts for, you know, as much as a quarter of all economic activity.
*  Yeah.
*  And for context, a quarter of the economy is huge, right?
*  Like in the US, it's far far lower than that.
*  That's right.
*  And it's also the place where most Chinese people park their money.
*  So, it has been the best way for Chinese people to accumulate wealth.
*  70% of all Chinese household assets are usually tied up in the property market.
*  Wow.
*  And it has been a huge driver of growth for China over the last three decades.
*  You know, as China has sort of lifted itself out of poverty, it's done so largely by building
*  more homes, building apartment buildings, building commercial buildings, and all that has fueled
*  the economy for years.
*  And it's not just that it's the usual sort of businesses and even consumers that are involved,
*  but it also is a huge part of how local governments get their money.
*  So in China, the government owns all the land.
*  And there aren't a ton of taxes.
*  And so, the main way that local governments tend to generate revenue to pay for basic services,
*  healthcare, education, even some infrastructure is basically to sell the right of use on
*  land that they own.
*  And so, basically, that property developers, when they want to build a new building, they
*  come into the local government and they say, we want the right to use this land.
*  And then they went into an auction and that money goes into paying for social services.
*  So education, healthcare, all those kind of things.
*  Okay.
*  So local governments are dependent on real estate development in order to pay for basic services.
*  What happens is they lease out the land.
*  Developers come in, build their buildings, and that's how they pay for pensions and pay
*  for healthcare and do things like that.
*  Correct.
*  But what ends up happening as a result of this is the local government is highly incentivized
*  to continue to build even when perhaps there isn't the population or the demand for it.
*  And so this tends to fuel sort of this property bubble that, you know, there are more homes
*  than there is sort of demand for.
*  And what does it look like when that starts to really go wrong?
*  What happens?
*  Yeah, I think like all property bubbles, there's a sort of belief that, you know, the prices
*  will go up forever.
*  And when you start to see sort of cracks in that idea, then confidence starts to win.
*  And the same dynamics that pulled the property prices higher start to pull them down.
*  And we're starting to see that across China, especially in cities where they have built
*  up very quickly and they don't really have the industry to support it.
*  And so one city that we sort of looked at was the city called Nancheng, which is the capital
*  of the Jiangxi province in the eastern China.
*  And it is one of these cities where they had built up very, very quickly at one point,
*  they had as many high rises as Beijing.
*  Wow.
*  Even though Beijing was three times its size and a very wealthy economy.
*  And so what we're seeing now is that it has about 20% vacancies amongst the highest within
*  China.
*  You know, a lot of the prices have started to fall.
*  And that even though the prices are cheap there and that's alluring for a lot of young
*  people, they get there and they find out, well, there aren't really good jobs here.
*  You know, the industries that they had been hoping would show up with high tech jobs, those
*  never really showed up.
*  And so they often go back to Beijing or Shanghai, the big cities because there's just more
*  economic opportunities there.
*  So this was a city that was built for some future that never really arrived.
*  And now it's buckling under the pressure of all of this development, all of these high
*  rises to nowhere.
*  Correct.
*  I mean, their whole sort of motto was that we're going to expand and that, you know, we're
*  going to sort of urbanize this place.
*  And ultimately sort of the jobs never came.
*  And now you have a lot of high rises for, you know, not many people.
*  And what are the statistics showing how much the property market has dropped?
*  So there's a lot of figures out there right now.
*  Last year, new home sales fell about a quarter from a year earlier.
*  And in June, we saw that some of the biggest property developers in the country reported
*  the sales of property fell 28%.
*  Wow.
*  So these are huge declines that are happening across the country.
*  What I would say is that it's being hit especially hard in the smaller places.
*  So when people think about China, they often think about the kind of big cities like Beijing
*  and Shanghai.
*  But the vast majority of the property market is done in these smaller cities.
*  And so when building really slows down in these places is a huge impact on the overall
*  economy because as we said earlier, the property market accounts for a quarter of all economic
*  activity.
*  And so when these cities slow down, the all of China tends to slow down.
*  And that's kind of where we are right now.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Okay.
*  So, Dai, you just explained China's housing market and how that has played a role in the country's
*  faltering economy.
*  But you also told me that foreign investment is playing a role.
*  So let's talk about that.
*  Walk me through it.
*  You know, after the COVID measures were lifted, what we expected to see was this flood
*  of foreign investment to make up for sort of lost time.
*  But we really haven't seen that.
*  And part of that is because there's this growing concern that China is just not a reliable
*  place for business.
*  And what we started to see after COVID was that companies like Apple moved some production
*  of iPhone to India, moved some production of AirPods to place like Vietnam.
*  And I think that a lot of other companies started to see China as perhaps not what it once
*  was and look for alternatives to China.
*  Earlier this year, we saw a survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China, which is, you
*  know, the group of the biggest multinationals operating there.
*  And for the first time in that survey's history, more than half their members said the
*  China is no longer a top three priority of places to invest.
*  And that marks a really big shift because China has long been the place where companies
*  have thought they could find growth.
*  And why don't these foreign companies see China as reliable now?
*  Yeah, I think, you know, you have to remember that for decades, even though China is a
*  communist country, that it's always been considered very business-friendly, that it's pragmatic
*  when it comes to issues of the economy.
*  And that started to change under Xi Jinping.
*  During zero COVID, companies felt like they weren't getting enough information about what
*  was happening on the ground and how long perhaps these lockdowns were happening.
*  And more recently, what we've started to see is that places like consultants that provide
*  sort of reliable sources of information in the country where that's quite difficult to
*  obtain are now being cracked down upon.
*  So tell me about that.
*  Like, what's the nature of the crackdown?
*  So if you were to go to China and you wanted to build a factory, you want to know who are
*  my business partners?
*  Who invests in my business partners?
*  You want to know all this stuff as a foreign investor.
*  And so that kind of information is pretty hard to get sometimes in China.
*  And so you hire firms to find out who are these people I'm in business with and what are
*  some of the risks that I'm facing.
*  But China started to see this as a national security threat.
*  And you have to keep in mind the broader context here, which is the geopolitical tensions
*  between China and the US have never been higher.
*  These two countries who have long been sort of connected at the hip economically are now
*  starting to see frame.
*  And a big part of that has been these measures taken by the White House to sort of limit China's
*  access to cutting edge semiconductor technology, which is seen by Beijing as a real provocation.
*  Huge step, very radical step by the United States against China.
*  For sure.
*  And it was seen by them as an effort by the US to sort of contain China and prevent their
*  rise.
*  And I think with the growing sort of geopolitical tensions and sort of the worsening relationship
*  between US and China, even business information is being sort of swept up under the rug of
*  national security.
*  And it was sort of underscored by changes in April that Beijing made to their counter
*  espionage law, which was already quite broad and sweeping.
*  And the changes they made made a lot of foreign businesses uncomfortable because it basically
*  put a lot of the things that one would do in the course of doing business investigating,
*  looking into the background of potential partners as potentially spying.
*  And that caused a lot of concern, I think, in the business community.
*  So basically they see economic information in some ways of state secrets and companies
*  that dig it up as spies.
*  That's right.
*  And in the last couple of months against that backdrop, we saw officials raid the offices
*  of two American firms, Mins and Bain.
*  So in that environment, it's very hard for companies to make sort of longer term commitments
*  to China, such as building a factory or a facility, adding staff.
*  And so when companies think and they're looking out 10 years for what they want to do, China
*  becomes less attractive of a place to park their money.
*  And do you have any sense of how much foreign investment has pulled back at this point?
*  You know, we saw one analysis saying basically that foreign direct investment in China fell
*  to $20 billion in the first quarter.
*  Now that still sounds like a lot of money.
*  But when you compare it to $100 billion last year in the first quarter.
*  Oh, wow.
*  That's a pretty significant drop.
*  So $20 billion in the first quarter of the year, but down from $100 billion in the year
*  before.
*  Correct.
*  So, Dai, you've laid out really clearly some of the reasons why China's economy is
*  stalled.
*  So, you know, domestic issues with the real estate sector, a quarter of the economy, chilling
*  effect on foreign investment with all of the changes that she is making.
*  But I'm still left wondering, what does that feel like for a Chinese person experiencing
*  this?
*  What is happening in Chinese society with these changes?
*  Yeah, there's broad concern about the economy.
*  And the way that sort of manifests is that businesses are reluctant to invest, are reluctant
*  to hire.
*  And, you know, the people who get affected the most are young people.
*  And we've really seen a spike in youth unemployment.
*  It is at a record high near 21%.
*  21%.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  It's really a shocking number.
*  Considering that almost four years ago, the number was at 10%.
*  And so, young people tend to be the ones who are sort of most vulnerable when an economy
*  turns south because they have the least experience.
*  And they're sort of the easiest to let go when things are not going great.
*  So, they've been the ones that have particularly suffered in this downturn.
*  I mean, one in five young workers is pretty astounding number.
*  Yeah.
*  And all this is happening at a really critical time because in June and July, we're expecting
*  another 11.8 million college graduates to come onto the job market.
*  And these are people who have been sold sort of the version of the Chinese dream, you
*  know, that if they go and work very hard and study for a long time, they will be given
*  a future that is better than the ones that their parents had.
*  And it's sort of an upward mobility.
*  And yet, they're finding themselves either struggling to find work or being forced to take
*  jobs that they are really not that interested in.
*  So, basically, China's college educated young people, aka China's future, are kind of
*  facing the prospect of, you know, going back to same old factory jobs that their parents
*  had.
*  Correct.
*  And even in jobs that were once sourcing a stable, but not super attractive, such as government
*  jobs, bureaucratic roles, even those jobs are becoming incredibly competitive.
*  We saw last year that basically there are 70 applicants for every one opening.
*  And so, even those kind of jobs are in high, high demand.
*  And Beijing turned this around.
*  Like, is the government talking openly about measures it might take to boost the economy?
*  There is an awareness that something needs to be done about the economy.
*  And we're actually starting to see some policy changes.
*  You know, last month, China's largest state run banks lowered the interest rates on deposits.
*  The idea is that by lowering those rates, you're giving people an incentive to go out and
*  spend money in the economy instead of just parking the money in the bank.
*  But it's a little too early to tell if that's going to work.
*  Another possible policy idea the country could use is raising exports.
*  And to explain how that might work, you know, the idea here is that by incentivizing companies
*  to produce more goods for exports or make their goods more competitive abroad, it would
*  create more jobs and prompt faster growth.
*  But that's going to be difficult because there just isn't as much appetite to buy Chinese
*  goods out in the world right now.
*  And just last week, we just got export data that showed export to drop 12% in June, which
*  is the biggest drop in three years.
*  So it's all looking quite difficult at the moment.
*  So Dai, coming back to where we started this conversation, you know, the explosive growth
*  that China saw for all of those years, it really feels like China is very far from those
*  days, that galloping stallion that the whole world wanted a piece of.
*  So I guess my question for you is, is the Chinese economic miracle over?
*  I think it's too early to say that.
*  I do think we are moving to a new phase of the economy where, you know, the Chinese economy
*  may not grow at double digit rates as it once did or even the seven or eight percent
*  that it once did.
*  I think what we're going to see is perhaps a little bit of slower growth.
*  And you know, it might have to come to, you know, accept a new reality that it won't necessarily
*  be the engine of growth in the world.
*  But I don't think we should dismiss China's importance still in the global economy.
*  It is still the second biggest economy in the world.
*  It has 1.3 billion consumers.
*  It has the most sophisticated and well-built manufacturing industry in the world.
*  And so it will still remain incredibly important.
*  But I do think that we're starting to transition to a new phase of the Chinese economy.
*  And that transition may not necessarily be smooth.
*  And what we'll see are perhaps more bumpy periods like we're seeing now.
*  And ultimately, how sort of Beijing reacts to those will really tell us kind of what
*  the next phase of the Chinese economy will be.
*  Diet, thank you for coming on the show.
*  Oh, thank you for having me.
*  On Monday morning, China released economic data showing that its economy had slowed dramatically
*  in the spring.
*  The economy grew less than 1% in the second quarter compared to the previous quarter,
*  as exports tumbled, a real estate slump deepened, and debt-ridden local governments cut spending
*  after running low on money.
*  The figure is amounted to a full-year growth rate of a little over 3%, down from about
*  9% in the previous quarter.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what you should note today.
*  On Friday, Republican lawmakers rammed a deeply partisan defense bill through the House,
*  paying up a showdown with the Senate that could impair all the legislation, which provides
*  pay raises for troops and sets defense policy.
*  The bill would limit abortion access, transgender care, and diversity training for military personnel.
*  Its passage was a victory for far-right Republican lawmakers, but it risks costing the party
*  its majority in the House as it makes some Republicans in competitive districts a target
*  in next year's midterm elections.
