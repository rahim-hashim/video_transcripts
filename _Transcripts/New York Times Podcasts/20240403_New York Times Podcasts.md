# The Accidental Tax Cutter in Chief
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4BFjtfro5E)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. This is The Daily.
*  Today In his campaign for re-election, President
*  Biden says that raising taxes is at the heart of his agenda. But as it turns out, so far,
*  he's done the opposite as president. My colleague, Jim Tankersley, explains.
*  It's Wednesday, April 3rd.
*  Jim, welcome back. We haven't seen you since State of the Union.
*  Always a pleasure. So, so great to be here.
*  And, yeah, I finally recovered from staying up all night with you guys.
*  Yeah, you don't even know all night. You stopped and we kept going.
*  That's true. I did. I got a robust three hours that night. You're right.
*  So, Jim, in your capacity as really the chief economic thinker covering this
*  president, you recently came across something very surprising.
*  Yeah, it started with a pretty basic question for me.
*  I like to do this crazy thing, Michael, where I like to take candidates' promises
*  and see if they've come true.
*  Insane.
*  It's a little bit wild, but it's what I do for fun.
*  And in this case, I wanted to look at a very central promise of President
*  Biden's campaign in 2020, which he has repeated while in office.
*  I promise you, I guarantee you we can build back and build back better with
*  the economy, the rewards work, not wealth.
*  The promise was he was going to raise taxes.
*  Well, I tell you what I'm going to do and I make no apologies for it.
*  I'm going to ask the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations
*  of the Fortune 500 companies, 91 making a collective billions of dollars,
*  didn't pay a single solitary penny in federal tax.
*  Not taxes on the middle class, not taxes on low income workers.
*  But he was going to raise taxes on corporations and the rich.
*  Well, I'm going to make sure they pay their fair share.
*  He was going to make them pay their fair share and he leaned into it.
*  Guess what?
*  You're going to start paying your fair share.
*  I'm going to ask them to finally begin to pay the fair share.
*  It's not a punishment.
*  Pay your fair share.
*  He said it over and over.
*  Fair share translation.
*  It's back to the failed policies of the 1970s.
*  Republicans loved this.
*  They repeated it too.
*  They told voters that the president was going to raise taxes.
*  Joe Biden bragging about raising taxes on corporations.
*  That means less money for those very employers to hire people back.
*  They talked about, you know, all the ways in which corporate
*  tax increases could rebound on workers.
*  Joe Biden will shut down your economy, raise taxes.
*  Once a four trillion dollar tax increase.
*  He's the only politician I've ever seen who said, we will raise your taxes.
*  It was a very big part of the economic debate for the campaign.
*  Right.
*  And I wanted to know, is that true?
*  Has that actually played out in the policy agenda the president has had?
*  So I asked some economists at the tax policy center in Washington to run
*  an analysis and just say, let's look at all of the ways Biden has changed
*  the tax code in all of those laws he signed and ask, has he raised taxes as president?
*  And it turns out the answer is he has not raised taxes.
*  On net, he has cut more taxes than he's raised.
*  How much more has he cut taxes than raised them?
*  So by the math that economists use when they look at budgets, the traditional
*  way of scoring tax changes, he has cut taxes by $600 billion on net.
*  A lot of money, a lot of tax cuts.
*  It's a lot of tax cuts.
*  The president has been a net tax cutter.
*  So Jim, why and how did Biden end up cutting taxes, especially if his
*  stated intent was to raise taxes?
*  Well, there's two sides of this equation and sort of two complimentary
*  explanations for what's happened here.
*  The first side is the tax increases that Biden ran on.
*  He's only done a couple of them.
*  He has trillions of dollars of ideas for how to raise taxes on rich
*  people and corporations.
*  The treasury department publishes an entire book full of them every year
*  called the Green Book, but in the actual legislation he signed, there's
*  only been a couple really, there was a tax on stock buybacks that companies
*  do, and then a new minimum tax for certain multinational corporations
*  that have very low tax rates.
*  Those add up to real money, but they are not in the grand scheme of Biden's
*  tax increases a really large amount of the agenda he's proposed.
*  So explanation number one, he just hasn't been that successful in passing
*  tax increases, and there's a lot of reasons for that.
*  The biggest one is just the simplest one is that he's just had a really hard
*  time persuading members of Congress, including Democrats to back some of
*  his favorite tax increases.
*  He wants to raise the corporate income tax rate, which president Trump
*  caught in his 2017 tax bill.
*  Biden wants to raise it to 28% from 21%.
*  Congress has not had any appetite to go along with that.
*  He wanted to get rid of what's called the carried interest loophole, like a long
*  time white whale of democratic policymaking, but he could not get even
*  50 Democrats to go along with that.
*  Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona was opposed to it, and so it didn't get
*  included, and he did some pieces of legislation on a bipartisan basis.
*  And in those cases, Republicans were just not going to pay for anything by
*  raising taxes, and so he had to take those off the table there.
*  So it's all added up to just not very much activity in Congress to raise
*  taxes on what Biden wants to do.
*  Got it.
*  So that's the side of a ledger where Biden simply fails to increase taxes
*  because he can't get Congress to increase taxes.
*  Right.
*  But there's another side, which is also that Biden has signed into
*  law a decent number of tax cuts.
*  And that starts from the very beginning.
*  Just a couple months into his presidency, if you'll recall, we're
*  still in the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic.
*  The economy is wobbling after it had started to rebound.
*  Biden proposes what is essentially a stimulus bill.
*  Right.
*  And he includes some tax cuts in there, a tax cut for families, a child tax credit.
*  And it also includes, you remember those direct checks that people got as part of that bill?
*  Yes, $1,400.
*  I remember them.
*  Yes.
*  Those were technically tax cuts.
*  So the stimulus bill starts with that.
*  The next year, he passes this bill that is trying to accelerate manufacturing of
*  things like semiconductors in the United States.
*  That's the CHIPS Act.
*  And that includes some corporate tax cuts for companies that invest in the kind of
*  manufacturing that Biden wants.
*  This is industrial policy via carrots for corporations.
*  And Biden is handing them out as part of this bill.
*  So tax cuts there.
*  And then finally, the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes the largest climate
*  effort in American history, is a bunch of corporate tax cuts at its core.
*  Tax cuts for manufacturing of solar panels, tax cuts for people to buy electric
*  vehicles, tax cuts for all sorts of things tied to the transition from fossil fuels to
*  lower emission sources of energy.
*  And those tax cuts add up.
*  They add up for corporations.
*  They add up for individuals.
*  And in the end, that full suite of tax cuts that he's passed across all of this
*  legislation outweighs the modest tax increases that were also included in the
*  Inflation Reduction Act to reduce its cost.
*  Got it.
*  So a very big reason why Biden ends up cutting taxes beyond the fact that he's not
*  able to raise them through Congress is that that's what it took, according to those
*  in his administration, to get American industry and American consumers to change
*  their behavior in line with policy goals, such as getting more domestic
*  computership manufacturing and getting more people to buy electric vehicles.
*  They decided the way to do that was to give people tax breaks, which means he cut
*  their taxes.
*  Right.
*  People and companies.
*  The president certainly has talked throughout the campaign about wanting to
*  give middle-class families a break, but he is also in the process of crafting
*  policy, really come to rely on tax cuts for people and for corporations as a way
*  of achieving these policy goals.
*  And in many cases, again, this is what he had to do to pass these bills through
*  even Democrats in Congress.
*  You know, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia didn't want to just send money
*  to companies that were making solar panels.
*  He wanted there to be tax incentives for it.
*  And so that is part of the reason why these were created as tax incentives.
*  And so all this adds up to more of a tax cutting record than you might have
*  imagined when Biden was on the campaign trail.
*  I'm curious who really ended up benefiting from these tax cuts.
*  You said they went to people and to corporations.
*  But on the whole, did they end up reaching lower income Americans, middle
*  income Americans, or the rich?
*  Well, we don't have a full distributional analysis, which is what you're asking
*  for, of the entirety of Biden's tax changes.
*  But we can say this, particularly the ones that were in that early stimulus
*  bill, the recovery plan, those were very much targeted toward lower income and
*  middle income Americans.
*  There were income limits on who could get things like the child tax credit.
*  Obviously, the direct payments went to people who were middle class or less.
*  So the analysis of that would suggest that these were tax cuts for lower
*  income people, for middle class people.
*  And on the flip side, what I think we are likely to see with the electric vehicle
*  credit through the Inflation Reduction Act is that while there are some income
*  limits on who can qualify for that credit, that the people who end up claiming that
*  credit tend to be the higher earners among the people who qualify.
*  Right.
*  Who buys a Tesla after all?
*  Somebody with a fair amount of money.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  And of course, the corporate tax cuts go to companies, flow through to their
*  shareholders.
*  There's a huge debate in the academic literature among politicians about how
*  much of that benefit actually ends up going to their workers versus stays with
*  shareholders.
*  But we can broadly say that Joe Biden has done a lot for certain corporations who
*  are trying to advance his manufacturing goals in particular to reduce their tax
*  bills.
*  And that is certainly not in line with the rhetoric you hear him talking about
*  most of the time about making corporations pay their fair share.
*  And the White House acknowledges this.
*  I asked them about it and they basically said, you know, we think there's a
*  difference between just cutting the corporate tax rate in a way that helps
*  anybody no matter what they're doing.
*  And what we're trying to do, which is basically reward corporations for
*  accelerating the energy transition.
*  Understood.
*  But where does this ultimately leave Biden's campaign promise to make the tax
*  code fairer and to make sure that the well-off in particular and corporations
*  are paying their what he called fair share?
*  I think by Biden's own measurements, by his own ambitions, he would have to
*  agree that he is nowhere close to what he believes would be a fair share for
*  corporations because Biden is still running on this as he enters his
*  reelection campaign, as it really heats up a rematch with Donald Trump.
*  The president is really leaning into this message of we need to do more.
*  We need to raise more taxes on corporate America.
*  It is time for these companies and for high earners to pay their fair share.
*  Right.
*  I didn't get it done the first term, but if you elect me, I'll get it done the
*  second.
*  Give me another shot.
*  And this time I promise we'll be different.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Jim, let's talk about Biden's tax raising plans for a theoretical second
*  term and why anyone should have any faith that he could get it done if there's a
*  second term, given the experience so far of his first term.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, man, there's a lot of plans to talk about.
*  I don't think we can get through all of them, but we can certainly hit the
*  highlights here.
*  So we can start with the couple of things that Biden has been able to do to
*  get the best out of the second term.
*  Start with the couple of things that Biden has been able to do to raise taxes
*  on corporations.
*  He sort of like wants to take those and then plus them up.
*  How so?
*  He's put this new minimum tax on corporations.
*  It's a 15% minimum tax on certain multinationals.
*  He now wants to raise that to 21%.
*  He wants to take that corporate stock buyback tax, which is 1% right now, and
*  he'd like to quadruple it to 4%.
*  And then he goes after, you know, some things large and small.
*  He wants to do new taxes that hit the use of corporate and private jets.
*  He wants to do new taxes on companies that pay large amounts of compensation
*  to their executives.
*  And then we get to some really big taxes on high earning individuals.
*  So the president has said over and over again, he won't raise taxes on anyone
*  making less than $400,000 a year, but he's got a bunch of taxes for the people
*  above that.
*  So he wants to raise the top marginal income tax rate.
*  He wants to take it from 37%, which is the level set by president Trump's
*  2017 tax law and bring it back to 39.6%, which is what it was before.
*  He also wants to impose what he calls a billionaire's tax.
*  Okay.
*  It's a 25% tax on the total value of all of the assets of anyone worth more
*  than a hundred million dollars.
*  Okay.
*  Wait, I have several questions about this.
*  Please.
*  First being a fact check.
*  If it's a billionaire's tax, it's interesting that it's going after people
*  who have just a hundred million.
*  Yeah.
*  I think most billionaires would be offended at the inclusion of a hundred
*  million heirs in that.
*  Yes.
*  Totally agree that it's factually inaccurate the name.
*  Right.
*  But beyond that, this sounds very much like a wealth tax, which we don't really
*  have in our system.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a sort of wealth tax.
*  The Biden people don't call it a wealth tax, but it is a tax on something other
*  than income that you report every year to the IRS as having been earned.
*  It goes beyond just, oh, I got interest from my stock holdings or I made money
*  from my job.
*  It's, oh, the value of my art collection increased last year, and now Biden's
*  going to tax me on that increase, even if I didn't sell the art.
*  That's a real change.
*  And that reflects the president's view that people with enough money to buy
*  enormous art collections that appreciate enormously in value should be paying more
*  in taxes.
*  Right.
*  And of course, a tax like this is extremely, perhaps maddeningly hard to
*  actually pull off.
*  It's hard to get someone to describe their art collections value so that you
*  can apply a 25% tax to it.
*  So this might end up being more of a political statement than a practical tax.
*  Yeah.
*  There's also questions about whether it's constitutional.
*  So there's all sorts of drama around this proposal, but it is certainly, if nothing
*  else, a statement of the president's intent to make people worth a lot of money,
*  pay a lot more in taxes.
*  OK, so that's a lot of proposed tax increases.
*  Almost all of them focused on those who are rich and corporations.
*  Overall, Jim, what stands out to you about this Biden Term 2 tax increase plan?
*  I think we can very fairly say that it's the largest tax increasing plan by a
*  sitting president or a presidential nominee for a party in American history.
*  Wow.
*  He wants to get a lot of money from corporations and people who earn or are worth
*  a lot of money.
*  But the rub, of course, is it's hard to see the congressional math that lets Biden
*  accomplish these tax increases, some of which, like you said, he couldn't get
*  done the first time.
*  Why would we think he would get them done the second time, even if he wins this
*  fall?
*  Yeah, it would be really difficult.
*  Biden would have to win in November.
*  Democrats would have to take the House of Representatives back from Republicans,
*  which is certainly possible.
*  It's very closely divided right now.
*  Yep.
*  And they'd need to hold at least 50 seats in the Senate.
*  And then those 50 Democrats in the Senate would have to be willing to go along with
*  far more in tax increases than Democrats were last time around.
*  So if there is a second term, it feels like we should assume it will be very
*  difficult, perhaps even quite unlikely.
*  He's going to get to push through a lot of these taxes, which makes me wonder,
*  Jim, why is Biden running on a tax program that he knows has so little chance of
*  becoming reality?
*  And when it's pretty clear that he's gotten a lot of stuff done without raising
*  taxes, it turns out it's not been all that essential to getting infrastructure or
*  climate bills done.
*  So why is he making this so central?
*  Several reasons.
*  One of them is it's very important to him rhetorically to talk about fiscal
*  responsibility.
*  Big parts of the Biden agenda, the chips bill, the infrastructure bill, some of
*  the legislation were not actually paid for.
*  The spending and tax cuts were not offset by tax increases.
*  So they're going to add to the debt.
*  Right.
*  So they're going to add to the debt.
*  Same as to the stimulus bill.
*  But moving forward, the president has said that he's going to pay for his agenda
*  and he's actually going to have some extra tax dollars coming in leftover to help
*  pay down future budget deficits.
*  And on paper, it's the way to pay for Biden's other big expansive plans that he
*  hasn't been able to do what wants to.
*  Universal child care, federal paid leave, investing in elder care, just a whole
*  bunch of things that he still wants to do, more housing initiatives.
*  The president needs money to make a case that he's being fiscally responsible.
*  And this is the money that would do that.
*  Got it.
*  So that's one reason.
*  Another reason is the calendar.
*  Biden and his team are looking ahead to the end of 2025 and they know that if he
*  wins another term, he will be in office at a rare moment in Washington when
*  basically tax policy has to be on the congressional agenda.
*  Why?
*  Well, Republicans, when they pass their tax cuts in 2017, set a bunch of them to
*  expire at the end of 2025 in order to lower the cost of the bill.
*  These are the Trump tax cuts.
*  The Trump tax cuts.
*  And that includes all the tax cuts for individuals.
*  So now that those are coming due, there's going to be a fight in Washington over
*  whether to extend them or make them permanent or change them in some way, or
*  just let them expire.
*  And Democrats know there's going to be a huge fight that will reach almost
*  certainly the floor of the house and the Senate.
*  And so Biden wants to be ready.
*  He wants to be ready with a suite of policy proposals.
*  The Democrats can basically pull off the shelf and try to use to put
*  Republicans in a box.
*  Basically say, we would like to keep taxes low or cut them further for low
*  income workers, middle-class workers.
*  But we want to pay for that by raising taxes on the rich.
*  You Republicans also want to do nice things for low and middle-class workers,
*  but you want to cut taxes for corporations and the rich.
*  And we think that's a political loser for you.
*  So Biden is ready with what they think will be a political winner for Democrats
*  in this almost certain floor tax fight at the end of 2025.
*  Got it.
*  And that sort of brings us to the last reason why Biden is doing this and
*  maybe the most important, which is it's really good politics.
*  Just explain that.
*  Why is talking about tax increases, net tax increases, such good politics?
*  If you talk to Democratic pollsters, if you talk to people inside the
*  White House, outside the White House, political strategists, anywhere in
*  Biden's orbit, they all agree that the public loves the idea of forcing rich
*  people and corporations to pay their quote fair share.
*  It's just become a winning and central political argument in Democratic
*  campaigns, the idea that corporations avoid taxes, that rich people avoid
*  taxes, and that Joe Biden is trying to position himself as a champion of the
*  idea that they need to pay more.
*  Those corporations and those rich people need to pay more and he's going to make it happen.
*  You're describing this as something that is kind of a new political reality.
*  Is that right?
*  Yeah, it's sort of evolved over the last decade or so, I think.
*  You know, for a long time in Washington, the conventional wisdom was you just
*  couldn't talk about tax increases of any kind.
*  They were poison.
*  There was a whole anti-tax movement that did a really good job of messaging that.
*  And Democratic candidates got very scared of talking about raising
*  taxes, even on the very, very rich.
*  That started to turn over time, but it's really changed.
*  I think, you know, we saw in the 2020 election that the Democratic primary had
*  just enormous amounts of taxes on corporations and the rich funding, all
*  sorts of policy proposals, Medicare for all and universal childcare and
*  trillions and trillions of dollars.
*  And Democratic candidates like Liz Warren and Bernie Sanders sort of competing to
*  see who could tax corporations and the rich the most.
*  Biden is sort of a product of that primary.
*  He was one of the most moderate people in that group, but his proposals are
*  really outside of the historical norm for Democratic candidates up until then.
*  And that reflects the fact that pollsters have been doing all this research, finding
*  that the American people, including independents and increasingly numbers of
*  Republicans, just don't think corporations pay their fair share and are open to the
*  idea they should pay more.
*  This is really interesting.
*  And it makes me think that what you're really saying is that there might have
*  been a time when a Democratic nominee like Joe Biden might have reveled in his
*  image as an overall tax cutter.
*  But that is not this moment.
*  And that is not this candidate.
*  He wants to be a tax increase.
*  He thinks that is where the politics are.
*  I think that's exactly right.
*  When you think about tax increase or as tax increase or on the rich and on
*  corporations, you know, there's sort of two ways to be a successful populist
*  politician, right?
*  One of them is to be kind of like Trump and run around saying you're going to do
*  enormous tax cuts for everybody, which is sort of a Republican version of
*  populism. Trump, my biggest tax cut in history, I'm going to do another huge,
*  enormous tax cuts.
*  It's going to be so big you won't believe it.
*  There might've been a time when Democrats tried to follow that playbook, but Biden's
*  not doing that. He's leaning into the other side of populism.
*  He's telling workers, hey, I'm on your side with these big companies.
*  They're trying to screw you and I'm not going to stand for it.
*  And so I'm going to raise their taxes.
*  I'm going to make them pay more so that there's more money for you, whether that's
*  more tax cuts or more programs or whatever.
*  And that is sort of the Democratic version of populism right now.
*  And that's the one that Joe Biden is running on.
*  And that's why he's so happy to talk about raising corporate taxes, because it's a
*  way to tell workers, hey, I'm on your side.
*  Right. Even if that's not what he's done or ever may be able to do.
*  Yeah. Part of the problem with populism is that you make a lot of promises you
*  can't keep. And this certainly in his first term has been an area where the
*  president has talked a much bigger game than he's been able to execute.
*  Second term might be different, but that doesn't really matter for the campaign.
*  What matters is the rhetoric.
*  Well, Jim, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you. Always a pleasure.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Tuesday, Israel confirmed that it had carried out the airstrike that killed seven
*  aid workers delivering food to civilians in Gaza.
*  The attack, which occurred on Monday, struck a convoy run by the World Central Kitchen,
*  a nonprofit group. At the time of the attack, the aid workers were traveling in clearly
*  marked cars that designated them as noncombatants.
*  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the attack as unintentional and
*  said that his government deeply regretted the deaths.
*  In its own statement, World Central Kitchen called the strike unforgivable and said that
*  as a result, it would suspend its aid work in Gaza, where millions of people are in dire
*  need of both food and medicine.
