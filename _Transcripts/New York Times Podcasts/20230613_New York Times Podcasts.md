# A Forced Reckoning in the Restaurant Industry

*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tabernici, and this is The Daily.
*  When the Me Too movements swept through the country, exposing abuses at the highest levels
*  of power, the restaurant industry was a chief offender.
*  But the food world's main keymaker, the James Beard Foundation, only recently began to
*  reckon with that.
*  Today, food writer Brett Anderson explains how those attempts to hold the industry to account
*  prompted an entirely new Firestorm.
*  It's Tuesday, June 13th.
*  So Brett, last week, the James Beard Awards were handed out.
*  And I know the words James Beard, and I know they have something to do with food, but
*  that's about the extent of it.
*  So before we get into the changes at the awards, let's start with the basics.
*  What exactly are the James Beard Awards?
*  Well, the James Beard Awards are commonly likened to the Oscars of the Food World, and
*  I think that's a pretty apt description.
*  When you win a James Beard Award, you become basically forever known professionally as
*  a beard winner.
*  And it's something that attaches to your name that anyone in the food industry knows is
*  recognition of some sort of accomplishment.
*  It's something that can lead to restaurant opening opportunities.
*  It can lead to partnerships with hotels and casinos.
*  It can lead to book contracts.
*  So it can transform your life.
*  It can transform your career.
*  Okay, so these awards are a big deal.
*  Who votes on them?
*  Like what's the system?
*  Well, since the awards have been established, the voting body has always included food
*  journalists, and I myself was a voter for many years.
*  And also for a long time included past winners.
*  If you won a beard award, it meant you could vote on future beard awards.
*  It was sort of part of the perk of winning it.
*  That changed in recent years.
*  And the last two awards seasons, 2022 and the one that just completed have involved a
*  different voting process than they've had in the past.
*  And what was different about this time?
*  Well, historically, the beard awards have been meant to recognize culinary excellence, period.
*  And in recent years, the foundation, the James Beard Foundation, which is the nonprofit
*  in New York that administers the awards, has created new criteria that is beyond culinary
*  excellence and recognizes personal behavior as well.
*  Personal behavior.
*  Okay, so not just cooking and cheffery, but actual behavior, like how the chefs themselves
*  act.
*  Yeah, I think the James Beard Foundation is trying to address misbehavior and abuse
*  in the industry that it's in.
*  Just like a lot of other entities are throughout our culture.
*  And as it happens in the restaurant industry, that's a really big job.
*  There is an regulatory body overseeing any of that.
*  How do you even begin to do that?
*  Maybe let's start with this James Beard Foundation.
*  What is it and why is it trying to police the food world?
*  So James Beard was a famous cookbook author and sort of a food personality back before
*  there was such a thing.
*  He's known as the Dean of American Cookery.
*  And in the 50s and in the 60s, he was influential in sort of educating Americans about their
*  own cuisine.
*  At a time when people thought of culinary excellence as being sort of the exclusive province
*  of sort of French and Italians, he celebrated the food of Americans and the food of regional
*  America.
*  And he had a lot of influence on people who his contemporaries, including Julia Child,
*  who considered him something of a mentor and someone she really looked up to.
*  And after he died, those people got together and they bought his small townhouse in Greenwich
*  Village.
*  And 1986, they started the James Beard Foundation in that townhouse.
*  And the mission at the time was to create a center for culinary arts.
*  And it was a very, I think, small enterprise that was reflected by the smallness of the
*  townhouse if you've ever been there.
*  Okay.
*  So small group of foodies together at this little townhouse, how does that end up becoming
*  this giant thing that's a kingmaker in the food world?
*  Well, two things happened.
*  In 1991, the Beard Foundation creates the James Beard Awards, the thing that we know today
*  as the Oscars of the food world.
*  And that turned out to be a really good timing because right around the same time, next
*  on Food Network, you get the creation of the Food Network, the Food Network.
*  But today we're going to be making some breakfast.
*  You see how thin I'm slicing this?
*  And notice my angle, I'm going that just down.
*  I'm going across.
*  It started out doing shows that were really similar to what you would see on public television
*  who was instructional.
*  And we're talking about the Italian cooking and our love for it.
*  And then it started to change.
*  It started to be less about cooking instruction and more about the chefs themselves.
*  How do you like your anchovies?
*  You want to do it cross good?
*  You start to have real personalities like Emerald Legosi.
*  Oh, can you imagine being stuffed with anchovy like this?
*  Stuffed right in there like that and stuffed?
*  With just a few restaurants in New Orleans and became known all over the country.
*  Bam!
*  Bam!
*  For yelling bam on your show.
*  And you just kind of bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
*  Bobby Flay, all these other people.
*  My name is Bobby Flay.
*  My mission to find the best of the best.
*  To sort of turn cooking instruction shows into these sporting events.
*  And it created a celebrity around restaurants that just did not exist before.
*  Just exploding the restaurant and the chef culture out into the broader culture, right?
*  That suddenly everybody was talking about it.
*  Everybody knew about it.
*  Absolutely.
*  And you know, by the time you get into the early 2000s, you had these celebrity chefs who
*  I think were rightly like in the rock stars.
*  And the James Beard Awards were right there in the middle of it becoming more and more
*  relevant because chef culture was becoming more and more relevant.
*  I mean, I have a little bit of reflection of how drastic the change was in my own professional
*  experience.
*  I started as a restaurant writer and a food writer in the mid-90s in Washington, D.C.
*  And at the time, I was working for a paper that had never covered food before.
*  And that it wasn't a job that people particularly envied.
*  And by the end of that time at that job, I left that job in 2000.
*  You know, I started going to cocktail parties and people were asking me about my work all
*  of a sudden.
*  For reasons that went beyond wanting to know where to get good Vietnamese food, they wanted
*  to know if I'd met these people.
*  Interesting.
*  When I moved to New Orleans in 2000 to take a job at the daily newspaper here, Emerald
*  Legassi had a show that was about to debut a sitcom.
*  Remember Emerald, just be yourself.
*  Okay.
*  So, um, produced by the same people that created designing
*  women on NBC.
*  And now what we're going to do is, uh, add some essence.
*  Fam.
*  Now, I'm digging myself here, but that was a big deal, right?
*  That was the, that was when network television was the biggest platform for a mass market.
*  And he was on the same network as Seinfeld was on.
*  So food really had become culture?
*  Absolutely.
*  And then that culture sort of expanded.
*  And you have the arrival of importantly, Anthony Bourdain in his book, Kitchen Confidential,
*  which came out in 2000.
*  And I think established sort of this punk attitude in celebrity chef culture.
*  That was kind of a reaction to the, you know, the arena rock bombast of what you saw
*  on the food network.
*  Right.
*  Small shows and kind of grittier, dirtier and less polished.
*  Yeah.
*  Restaurant world that Bourdain captured was one that was populated by bandits who didn't
*  play by the rules.
*  They worked in environments that in his view, not everyone could hack.
*  And they didn't go chasing after celebrity.
*  They didn't look presentable for cameras.
*  They had knives.
*  They worked around blood.
*  They were cutting apart animals, right?
*  I mean, this was a very different look at the restaurant world than we had been accustomed
*  to on the food network.
*  And not for the faint of heart.
*  It wasn't for the faint of heart.
*  And I think the movement that Anthony Bourdain helped create where you have this pirate
*  version of the chef, the James Beard Awards honored all of these.
*  They honored the celebrity chefs.
*  They honored the pirate version of the chefs.
*  They honored restaurants with white tablecloths and without white tablecloths.
*  And through the 2000s and into the 2010s, you saw this expanding audience for this expanded
*  idea of what a chef can be and what a restaurant can deliver.
*  And the foundation benefited by being the foremost entity to validate excellence among all
*  these different archetypes.
*  So is food becomes a bigger and bigger part of culture and the chef's profiles rise,
*  the awards themselves become more prominent?
*  And suddenly the awards have become arbiters of culture.
*  Exactly.
*  And this ecosystem seems to be working for just about all involved until something really
*  big happens.
*  And now to those new allegations of sexual misconduct rocking the food industry.
*  Very early on in the Me Too movement, the subjects of some of the most explosive investigations
*  into the behavior of people included people like Mario Batali.
*  The times reports that in March, a woman told investigators that Batali drugged and sexually
*  assaulted her in January of 2004 at his New York City restaurant.
*  One of the most famous chefs in restaurants in America, a beard winner himself.
*  Batali gave this statement to the post saying, I apologize profoundly to the people I've
*  mistreated and hurt.
*  All of a sudden, these people that we were idolizing and celebrating start to be looked
*  at with scrutiny.
*  And we start asking questions as a culture about how the people who are employees of these
*  restaurants, who don't really benefit from that celebrity, how they're being treated,
*  and if they're being treated fairly.
*  And what we should think about that industry and that part of our culture based on what
*  we discover, where I live in New Orleans.
*  A chef named John Bash was the subject of an investigation that I did.
*  And he was far and away the most famous food figure in a town that is basically defined
*  by its culinary reputation.
*  There was comments about what we were wearing, how we looked in the office, but then also...
*  I found that this prominent restaurant company had what we would now call the toxic culture.
*  And then he asked me if I would come back to his hotel room with him.
*  And I told him no stormed out of the bar.
*  There were no written or...
*  Women in particular felt that they were sort of second-class citizens and that poor
*  treatment of them was tolerated and maybe even in some instances encouraged.
*  And I told him, you and I both know the reason that we're here goes back to when I wouldn't
*  have sex with John.
*  And that is why I'm being fired right now.
*  Both the Mara Batali and John Bash stories, I think, really opened the floodgates in the
*  restaurant industry.
*  And in my own personal experience, in the aftermath of the Besh investigation, I conducted over
*  a hundred interviews in the months after that came out here in New Orleans when I was working
*  at the local newspaper.
*  And that's a lot of people coming forward and saying, I've got a story of abuse that I
*  experienced in a restaurant that I think you need to hear about.
*  And I remember feeling I really owe it to these folks to hear them out, that I need to
*  be part of this reckoning in the business.
*  And I imagine that James Beard Foundation felt something similar, that they needed to
*  do something to fix this culture that they had benefited from and maybe even helped
*  to foster.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Brett, after me too, what is the James Beard Foundation decided to do?
*  Well, as far as we know, they don't do anything substantive to the awards program in the
*  immediate aftermath.
*  But in 2020, the foundation abruptly canceled the awards, which is something they'd never
*  done before.
*  Why?
*  There's two reasons that we know about.
*  The foundation's leader has discovered that there was no black winners in the awards
*  that year in any of their major categories.
*  And that happened while there was racial justice protests, unfolding all over the country
*  in the aftermath of the George Floyd murder.
*  Also, there was accusations that a number of the finalists were guilty of some of the
*  misbehavior that we saw revealed in the Me Too movement.
*  And so what they did is they ended up canceling not just the 2020 awards, but the 2021
*  awards.
*  And they used that time to really try to overhaul their award system.
*  And what exactly did they do?
*  Well, it did three big things.
*  The first was that it changed its voting body so that now the voting body is made up entirely
*  of judges that are hand picked by the foundation.
*  So in other words, more control over the vote.
*  More control and they've created a deliberately a more diverse voting body.
*  They also created a code of ethics that they require all candidates for awards follow.
*  So if you are going to be eligible for James Beard Award, you vowed to the foundation
*  that you follow its code of ethics.
*  And what was in the code?
*  What do they want you to follow?
*  Well, the code basically says that you're not allowed to treat people poorly.
*  You're not allowed to treat people unfairly.
*  And you're not allowed to commit felonies.
*  And that code of ethics is important.
*  And it leads to the third big thing they did, which is the foundation created a tip line
*  so that people can call into the foundation and inform them if they believe any of their
*  candidates have violated this code of ethics.
*  And then they created a process to investigate those tips.
*  So suddenly, the James Beard Foundation, which started as this kind of tiny dinner club,
*  is turning itself into a de facto investigative body, which is quite different.
*  And it's doing that in an industry which, as we all know, post me too, is filled with
*  some pretty difficult figures.
*  It is.
*  And this process is inherently difficult.
*  When the Beard Foundation gets these tips to this tip line, they have an ethics committee
*  which is made up of volunteers that looks into the allegations.
*  And they determine whether or not they're worth opening an investigation.
*  And if they do determine that the accusations are worth looking into, they hire outside investigators
*  to do that work.
*  So they're essentially outsourcing an investigation into what is probably some pretty sensitive allegations.
*  They really are.
*  And in the lead up to the awards this year, this redesigned awards program really came
*  in the public view for the first time.
*  A chef named Timothy Hansa, who was based in Birmingham, Alabama, was a nominee for Best Chef
*  South, was disqualified.
*  And he spoke publicly about it to reporters because he felt he was being treated unfairly.
*  He says that he received phone calls from private investigators that were working for the James
*  Beard Foundation.
*  And we're looking in the accusations that he yelled at employees and customers at his
*  restaurant.
*  So Brett, you reported this, you looked into it, what did you find?
*  I talked to some people, both customers and past employees who said that Hansa's behavior
*  was alarming.
*  But when I interviewed Hansa's, he told me that he doesn't deny any of these accusations.
*  He just says everything he's accused of is not as severe as the accusers are telling
*  the Beard Foundation and that none of them rise to the level of him having violated the
*  code of ethics.
*  He said that his problem really was with the process itself.
*  He believes it wasn't fair.
*  He believes he didn't get due process.
*  He, for example, doesn't know who they talk to.
*  And you know, using in a situation like this, you get to face your accuser, you get to
*  hear what the accusation is and you get to defend yourself at every step of the way.
*  But in this case, you only had one conversation with investigators.
*  Then they went away for a few weeks and then they get an email one day saying he's been
*  disqualified.
*  Right, it's like a grand jury proceeding that, you know, happens behind closed doors in
*  secret, except in this case, at the end of it, there's a verdict and he's guilty.
*  Effectively, that's the case.
*  And it turns out that he wasn't even the only candidate that was under investigation
*  by the foundation this year.
*  The other chef's name is Sam Four and she works in Lexington, Kentucky and she was a
*  finalist in the best chef, Southeast category.
*  Sam has a restaurant called Tuck Tuck and it actually is not even a brick and mortar restaurant.
*  It's a pop-up restaurant that serves sort of Southern cuisine inspired by this Sri
*  Lankan food that she grew up eating in a family of Sri Lankan immigrants in Kentucky.
*  On the very day that Hanzas went public with his own investigation and his issues with it,
*  she received a call from private investigators herself.
*  Four said that the investigators were looking into accusations that were made to the Beard
*  Foundation's tip line that she was bullying people and harassing them through her social
*  media posts.
*  She shared with me examples of a couple of the posts that she was asked about.
*  One was a public service announcement that she had made as part of a sexual violence awareness
*  campaign that she did in her community.
*  Researchers were posts that made accusations about people in her community but that never
*  named them and this was something she said she was mystified by and she said that she
*  asked the investigators, look, we've been talking now for 90 minutes and you can't even
*  tell me who I'm targeting with this bullying.
*  How can this be targeted harassment?
*  Oh my gosh, right?
*  As a reminder, for four, the stakes here are really high.
*  A nomination could make a huge difference for a chef running a pop-up restaurant.
*  Exactly.
*  Four said that after she became a semifinalist for the Beard Awards this year, she hired
*  a public relations firm for the first time in her life and her business up until quite
*  recently included only one employee herself.
*  So she's in sort of a heavy territory here.
*  Ultimately, Sam found out that she wasn't disqualified as a result of this investigation.
*  But in the end, she felt like she'd been really put through the ringer for what she says
*  are really bizarre complaints.
*  Brett, what is the James Beard Foundation say about all of this?
*  Like, what's their response?
*  Well, their blanket response is that they don't comment about any ethics investigations.
*  They say they do this because they are committed to celebrating the industry and not shaming
*  people and that they want to protect the identity of both the accusers and the accused.
*  I did continue to talk to leaders over there about this commitment to confidentiality, which
*  I think raises other problems that both Hanzas and Ford didn't even bring up themselves.
*  For instance, Hanzas, even though he's publicly known to have been disqualified, his name
*  remained on the ballot until the close of the judging for this year's awards.
*  Effectively, that meant that people could vote for Hanzas to win an award that he had
*  been disqualified for publicly.
*  Crazy.
*  That's just a fundamental flaw in the process, right?
*  Like, they didn't think it through.
*  Well, it even goes further because I asked then, well, will his name appear on the program
*  at the Gala in Chicago?
*  And they said yes, that their commitment to confidentiality even extended to that, which
*  then puts the foundation in this position of having discovered that a candidate is actually
*  not worthy of the award by their own standard, but is remaining in harmony in the eyes of
*  the public.
*  I mean, that just doesn't make any sense.
*  That's what I thought.
*  It does seem to be a flaw with this process.
*  And when I asked leaders there, they wouldn't come out and say that.
*  And what I was left to believe is they just never entertained a scenario in which someone
*  would go public with their disqualification.
*  Interesting.
*  I mean, maybe Brett, it just isn't all that surprising that in some ways, given that this
*  is a food foundation, a tiny one, and it's taken it upon itself to be a kind of version
*  of the FBI or the very least, you know, some kind of professional HR department to effectively
*  endeavor what really amounts to a very muscular investigation into personal behavior and potential
*  abuse.
*  Yeah, I do think that they did not anticipate how adversarial such investigations could
*  become.
*  I do believe that they thought that the respect for the foundation was such that people
*  in the chef community would just accept the decisions that were being made.
*  My experience as a reporter, as well as the co-author on this story, Julie Amaskin,
*  you know, we both have done a lot of these sorts of investigations.
*  And even ones that don't lead to stories do end up with some pretty hard feelings on
*  the part of people who are being asked about this behavior.
*  And the foundation is primarily in the business of celebrating this industry.
*  And you know, it raises money based on having good relationships with people in the chef
*  industry who cook at fundraisers for the foundation.
*  So Brett, when you look at the issues facing the food industry and the process of the James
*  Beard Foundation put into place to address those issues, I guess what I'm really wondering
*  is, is all of this really aimed at reforming chefs?
*  I mean, actually forcing change and forcing better behavior.
*  Or is there a simpler and more self-serving explanation, which is, you know, that they're
*  really just after protecting themselves, protecting the James Beard Foundation, you know,
*  saving themselves from being embarrassed by bad publicity?
*  To be honest, I think it's both.
*  I think the second reason is inarguable.
*  And I think it applies to all of the institutions that are in the food industry in the aftermath
*  of me too.
*  That said, I think it's an open question as to whether or not a program like this, an
*  investigatory program, can have a real effect on a restaurant business where bad behavior
*  continues to be a persistent problem.
*  I mean, we know there was a flood of media reports following me too.
*  And in the years since me too, about bad behavior in the restaurant industry.
*  And we know that that didn't eliminate bad behavior from the restaurant industry.
*  It did not have that effect, right?
*  I think it probably reduced the number of people who feel like they are entitled to abuse
*  their power, but it certainly didn't eradicate power abuse from the restaurant business.
*  And to be honest, I'm not sure what will.
*  But Brett, isn't there also a scenario where this process is clumsy as it is, might accidentally
*  lead to something good?
*  I think that it could.
*  And you know, the process could improve.
*  I find it hard to believe though that you could have an award that routinely disqualifies
*  people that won't routinely find itself in the midst of controversy.
*  Brett, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  It's a pleasure to be on the show.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media mogul, who became Italy's most polarizing and prosecuted
*  Prime Minister, died on Monday.
*  He was 86.
*  Berlusconi transformed Italian television, making it spectacular and taudry, and then,
*  as a politician, used it to influence voters.
*  Through multiple stints in office, Berlusconi revolutionized Italian politics, bringing
*  a brash populism and perfecting the practice of victimization.
*  He was a committed ally of America, but also an apologist for Vladimir Putin.
*  In the end, even Berlusconi's many critics agree that he changed Italy, leaving his
*  stamp on a generation of Italians who hungered for the wealth and confidence that he stood
*  for.
*  And, JP Morgan Chase reached a tentative settlement with sexual abuse victims of Jeffrey Epstein,
*  the financier who died in a New York jail before his trial.
*  The settlement followed a series of embarrassing disclosures about the banks' longstanding relationship
*  with Epstein.
*  One of the lead lawyers for the victims said the bank was prepared to pay $290 million
*  to resolve the lawsuit, which was filed in Manhattan, last November.
*  Today's episode was produced by Sidney Harper, Carlos Prieto, and Ricky Novetski.
