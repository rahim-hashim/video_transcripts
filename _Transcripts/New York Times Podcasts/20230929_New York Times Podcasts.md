*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro.
*  This is Adelaide.
*  Today, a showdown between House Republicans and their leader, Speaker Kevin McCarthy,
*  is about to turn into a government shutdown this weekend.
*  My colleague, Chief Washington correspondent Carl Hors, takes us inside the causes and
*  the consequences of the looming crisis.
*  It's Friday, September 29.
*  Carl, we are talking to you at about 12 o'clock on Thursday afternoon at this very moment
*  in your estimation.
*  How likely is it that the US government shuts down the deadline is 12 o'clock 1 a.m. on
*  Saturday?
*  I mean, pretty likely.
*  And here's one good reason for that.
*  The Senate right now is not even scheduled to take a final vote on its emergency plan until
*  Sunday.
*  Which is not very helpful when the deadline is midnight Saturday.
*  I mean, there could be a coup in the moment where everybody says, okay, listen, we're going
*  to avoid this.
*  Let's just pass something to keep the money going.
*  Panic could set in.
*  Right.
*  It's like, oh, we're going to get killed for this.
*  Let's not do it.
*  But right now, the timetable itself is set to have a shutdown.
*  Got it.
*  So we want you to explain in way only you can why we're going to be enduring this awful
*  experience of a government shutdown, why it is now looking inevitable.
*  And a lot of the basic dynamics, of course, Carl have become very familiar to our listeners
*  that Republicans have a very slender majority.
*  And ever since they took over the house at the beginning of the year, that has meant
*  that a very tiny group of hard right conservatives have been able to basically run the United
*  States House of Representatives.
*  And Kevin McCarthy.
*  So I take it back to his election for the speaker about 20 very hard core conservative
*  Republicans at various points in that election were opposed to speaker McCarthy.
*  So he couldn't really get elected without making some concessions to these people.
*  Certainly the Democrats weren't going to bail them out.
*  Right.
*  So he made a lot of promises back then.
*  None of them were written down and all of us have asked, hey, can we see these promises?
*  And Kevin McCarthy said he didn't want anything written down.
*  So among those promises was to return federal spending to pre-COVID levels.
*  That's what conservative Republicans want.
*  All that money went out the door for a lot of COVID programs.
*  So the promise was to go back to pre-COVID spending.
*  But that just hasn't happened.
*  And they've been putting the heat on him to fulfill that promise.
*  That's basically what's going on.
*  Right.
*  So one of the promises, big spending cuts, one of the other promises, and this one did
*  get written down, was that at any single moment under McCarthy's speakership, a single
*  House Republican could call for McCarthy to be removed as speaker, which further empowered
*  these far right Republicans as we talked about in past episodes, because it gives them
*  a kind of veto power over his entire speakership.
*  And now as you just established, he has disappointed them in that speakership.
*  Right.
*  So you're referring to what's known as the motion to vacate.
*  So he lives under this threat and they could bring it forward.
*  So he operates constantly trying to figure out how to avoid having that motion called on
*  him.
*  And as I recall, the first really big time we see that play out is a couple months ago
*  during the US debt ceiling debate.
*  This, I know these all get very confusing and piled up.
*  That was the last time we faced a giant crisis of whether our government could function
*  and it was around whether we might default on our debt.
*  Right.
*  Which was a serious, very serious thing, more serious than a shutdown, I would say, right?
*  Defaulting would have been the first time in history and it would have been an economic
*  crisis.
*  So Kevin McCarthy, I think, recognized what was at stake in the debt limit fight.
*  So we worked through the night last night, we're finalizing.
*  And he decided ultimately, sat down with the president, I said, let's work together to
*  be able to raise the debt ceiling, but curve the amount of spending to cut a deal with
*  President Biden that set certain spending levels that dissatisfied a lot of his far right
*  members.
*  We know at any time when you sit and negotiate within two parties that you got to work
*  with both sides of the aisle.
*  So it's not 100% what everybody wants, but when you look at the country's way.
*  And the deal ultimately passed in the house with more democratic than Republican votes.
*  Right.
*  Because in that moment, he basically chooses the nation's financial health over potentially
*  his own relationship with these far right Republicans who can kind of fire him at any
*  moment.
*  Right.
*  And they were very unhappy.
*  What I see here in this deal is absolutely one of the biggest abominations since I've
*  been in Washington, DC.
*  Americans and trillions of dollars in debt for crumbs.
*  We fought extensively to empower each individual member of Congress, not unilaterally, give
*  our authority over to the speaker to negotiate a bad deal.
*  How come it is that Republican leaders always tell us next year will fight hard.
*  We really mean it next year.
*  And that was when they kind of laid down their marker and said, listen, we are not going
*  to let the business of the house go forward unless you meet our demands on spending.
*  And we're going to do that through procedural guerrilla warfare.
*  And they did do it.
*  And trust me, they've been very effective.
*  And that dynamic is what's gotten us to this point to where we're facing a shutdown.
*  Do you believe the government is going to shut down?
*  Yes.
*  And it's Kevin McCarthy's fault that the government is going to shut down.
*  Well, let's talk about that because McCarthy very well understands the only way he avoids
*  a shutdown.
*  Another potential government catastrophe is to do what he did when it came to the debt
*  ceiling and the risk of default, which is to pass a bill that Democrats like and that
*  some moderate Republicans like.
*  But of course, as we have very well established here, that leaves him exposed to this Republican
*  maneuver of trying to house to the speaker.
*  Right.
*  And that's a very real risk right now because Matt Gates, Republican from Florida, whose
*  his chief nemesis right now among Republicans has said if McCarthy makes a deal with the
*  Democrats, he will go with the motion of a K. But for Kevin McCarthy, it's kind of
*  the only way out of this mass.
*  He has to cut a deal at some point with Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden.
*  There's no other way to do this.
*  The Senate is controlled by Democrats and President Biden, obviously, is a Democrat.
*  So he is in a position where he is trying to at least appear that he's holding firm
*  against the Democrats.
*  But at some point, he has to make a deal.
*  So he decided to do something that he thought would appease the right and maybe get him
*  passed this.
*  And that was announcing an impeachment inquiry of President Biden.
*  Right.
*  He could maybe satisfy these guys and give him some wiggle room on spending, basically.
*  But it didn't.
*  They wanted to impeach the president anyway.
*  And the fiscal hawks are like, well, that doesn't change our mind on spending.
*  We still want these spending cuts that even a lot of the more mainstream, how does Republicans
*  don't want?
*  So, you know, this internal dispute has really messed things up to use a technical term.
*  So not even an impeachment inquiry into the president of the United States, based on
*  what we have established, pretty shaky evidence, is able to buy McCarthy enough goodwill with
*  these hard right Republicans to avoid us hurtling towards a shutdown.
*  I just want to understand why McCarthy cannot once again work with the Democrats to save
*  the system.
*  And perhaps assume that if he does that, those Democrats might bail him out in an eventual
*  vote that the far right Republicans might want to hold to oust him.
*  That would seem like a reasonable political calculation.
*  Yeah, well, I don't think it's all that reasonable, Michael.
*  So if he makes a deal with the Democrats, they're certainly going to be a move to oust him.
*  Everyone has promised that McCarthy knows that.
*  So your question is, are the Democrats going to ride to the rescue?
*  Right.
*  I have talked to numerous Democrats about this, including the Democratic leader just yesterday,
*  a Kim Jeffries from New York, obviously.
*  He says, we're not there yet.
*  We're not even thinking about it.
*  I'm not sure they're not even thinking about it.
*  I think they're thinking a lot about it.
*  They're just not talking about it and certainly not to me.
*  But I think after the debt limit vote, the Democrats were happy with McCarthy.
*  He was willing to take the risk.
*  He saved the country's financial standing and credit rating and all of our 401Ks, right?
*  So I think if they'd had that vote then, I think he probably would have gotten help from
*  Democrats.
*  Now I'm not sure he gets any help from Democrats because what did he do to appease the far
*  right one?
*  He didn't stick to the agreement on the debt limit, and he made.
*  And two, he said, let's impeach Joe Biden.
*  So they're like, well, why would we go with this guy?
*  Right.
*  Those are not the keys to unlocking Democratic support bailing out on an agreement and
*  starting a process that could remove their president.
*  Yeah.
*  So there is no certainty, obviously, that Democrats would help him.
*  But boy, does Kevin McCarthy want to be speaker?
*  He loves being speaker.
*  I've never seen a speaker.
*  And I think I counted.
*  I've been around for eight.
*  Wow.
*  I've never seen anyone kind of relish the job so much.
*  He stands in the rotunda in a photo line and shakes hands and takes selfies with tourists.
*  I mean, the guy is really into it.
*  So he does not want to lose that job certainly in like an embarrassing humiliating thing on
*  the floor.
*  So I remember we were all standing there watching these 15 votes that it took for him to become
*  speaker.
*  Most people, I think, would have said, I don't really want it that bad, but he did.
*  And he does.
*  So, Carl, what I'm hearing you say is we should not underestimate the degree to which Kevin
*  McCarthy will cling to this job with everything he has to the very last possible minute because
*  he just wants desperately to stay on his speaker.
*  And so this shutdown will be the exact opposite dynamic of what happened with that debt ceiling
*  negotiation instead of being willing to risk his job to save the system.
*  McCarthy will pretty consciously sacrifice the system to save this job.
*  He loves so much.
*  We don't know yet what his moment of truth is going to be.
*  He could still capitulate here and say, okay, I've got to do something to keep the government
*  open.
*  I'm going to work with Democrats.
*  I'm going to take the risk.
*  I'm a little Irish, okay?
*  I don't walk away from a battle.
*  I knew changing Washington would not be easy.
*  I knew people would be like, but so far we have not seen that as he did in the debt limit.
*  We want to be able to win the policies that we've been fighting for and telling the American
*  public.
*  And I think right now he is putting his interest in that job ahead of the possible consequences
*  of a shutdown, which we are at this very moment, careening towards.
*  And you know what, if it takes a fight, I'll have a fight.
*  And it's going to have big consequences.
*  We've been through this before and we know that there is some pain, some real pain for
*  people.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Carl, I want to talk about the pain that comes with a shutdown, assuming as we are
*  now doing that there's going to be a shutdown in the next day or two.
*  And this is not, of course, your first shutdown.
*  So you bring some real authority to the subject of this pain.
*  Not my first shutdown rodeo as they say.
*  I can't tell you how many I've been through, but I've been through long ones, short ones,
*  medium ones.
*  They all have their own little dynamic.
*  This one's a little different because past shutdowns have been like over one big issue,
*  right?
*  So over Obamacare.
*  Right.
*  That was a shutdown.
*  The Democrats forced a very brief shutdown in 2018 over DACA, the young undocumented immigrants
*  brought here as kids and whether to get them citizenship.
*  Trump had one over the border wall.
*  This is a little more amorphous.
*  But the government unfortunately knows how to do this.
*  There's a manual.
*  Literally a manual.
*  I'm sure there's many, many manuals actually.
*  But if this one happens, it's going to happen on the weekend.
*  So the first consequences won't be felt as much.
*  It'll be kind of like a slow rolling disaster if it goes into next week.
*  And there's a lot of things that happen.
*  Certainly things stay open.
*  There's essential people, but they won't be paid.
*  I have a son who works on Capitol Hill and he is not relishing the prospect of not being
*  paid.
*  Certainly in Washington and that's surrounding area.
*  There's a lot of people who will be going without paychecks if this goes for very long.
*  The military will not be paid.
*  In the past, that's been avoided either through a special bill to make sure that they keep
*  getting paid or the defense spending bill had already been passed.
*  So that part of the government was covered this time, not the case.
*  So they wouldn't be paid unless there's a special step taken to pay them.
*  That has not happened so far.
*  Another really important group that won't be paid are air traffic controllers.
*  Obviously, hugely important to the economy and just to life in general.
*  We've already seen a bunch of travel disruptions over the past months.
*  So can you imagine what happens if there's some sort of slow down there with air traffic
*  controllers?
*  How long are they going to be willing to work without paid?
*  As these jobs are stressful enough, do you really want to be more stressed out by their
*  economic worries?
*  Right.
*  And I guess we should add, Carl, as our colleagues have reported in the times that there's
*  a long time national shortage of air traffic controllers.
*  It's well documented.
*  And the idea of not paying controllers as you've just raised might lead some controllers
*  to not show up at work, maybe call and sick.
*  And then you've got thousands of planes in the air and not enough air traffic controllers
*  and that's an incredibly dangerous situation.
*  Yeah, I'm not looking forward to catching a plane in those circumstances.
*  But I think that this is a real concern that people have.
*  What will happen to the air traffic control system?
*  What happens to the airports?
*  Also, I mean, air traffic controllers, obviously aren't the only thing.
*  There's other big popular parts of the federal government that will be affected.
*  National parts.
*  Now, you still may be able to go into a national park, but there's not going to be any
*  facilities open, bathrooms even.
*  And one of the big images from past shutdowns is trash piling up out on the national
*  mall, right?
*  Because the people who would normally pick it up aren't being paid.
*  They're not working.
*  Are not there.
*  And the government also prohibits volunteers from my recollection is you can't go out
*  there and pick up that trash.
*  So the consequences of this and the reach of it are very broad.
*  And here's another thing.
*  It costs billions of dollars.
*  What do you mean?
*  There's all sorts of costs associated with the shutdown, you know, shutting things down,
*  starting them back up.
*  I mean, the federal government is a huge thing.
*  And so you don't just go, okay, it stops, you know, then you got to restart everything.
*  So there is an actual economic cost here.
*  That of course, Carl is a bit ironic for the people who are triggering this shutdown,
*  who say that they want to cut federal spending.
*  You're saying on some level, this is going to cost the government more money.
*  Yeah, definitely true.
*  I mean, there are costs associated with it.
*  And that is one of the great ironies here, right?
*  So interesting.
*  Lawmakers get paid because of the Constitution.
*  So they can't stop themselves from being paid, which is also sort of a not great look
*  for them.
*  No, not a great look when the military is not being paid and air traffic controllers
*  aren't being paid.
*  So given your experience with past shutdowns, help us understand how, when and why these
*  things become intolerable at some point, because they always do come to an end, there's
*  just a question of how long.
*  I think the last one was around 40 days.
*  Now, and they do.
*  One kind of trueism about it is once you get into a shutdown, it gets hard to get out
*  legislatively, right?
*  People get dug in and some people are going to go, oh, it's not that bad.
*  But there will be bad.
*  I mean, a travel disruption.
*  There'll be something that people will find intolerable as it drags on it.
*  And generally, just people looking at Congress going, what is wrong with you people?
*  Honestly, I do think that that's a factor.
*  Right.
*  And in terms of people being mad at Congress and looking at them and saying, what's the matter
*  with you, it doesn't feel like the blame here is going to end up being all that ambiguous,
*  right?
*  This is a Republican shutdown through and through.
*  And so ultimately, it's going to be Republicans who are going to have to decide it's reached
*  a tipping point.
*  Right.
*  This is really falling hard on the House Republicans.
*  And I think that's a real concern for them going into the election next year that people
*  are going to go, this is ridiculous.
*  Now, they're trying their best to wiggle out of it.
*  McCarthy was asked the other day.
*  It's like, why are we having this shutdown?
*  He said, ask Joe Biden.
*  McCarthy is trying to shift the blame right now.
*  But I don't think it's going to work.
*  The House Republicans are going to bear the brunt for this one.
*  And does that mean that Democrats on some level are over in the corner with a little bit
*  of glee on their faces?
*  Or do they worry that, as with all disasters, it splashes on them too?
*  Yeah, I think a little bit of that.
*  But I think generally speaking, most people on Capitol Hill are like, we can't do this.
*  This is horribly disruptive.
*  But I think at the White House, also, it's like people ultimately look at this and say,
*  well, the president's got to do something.
*  So I think that they are fairly sure that Kevin McCarthy and the Republicans are going
*  to take the hit for this.
*  But they don't want it to go on for too long because then people start to say, why aren't
*  you fixing this?
*  Got it.
*  It's a complicated little balancing act for the Democrats and for Biden.
*  Because you said earlier, when a deal finally comes and it always does come, it will by definition
*  have to be bipartisan.
*  Yeah, there's no way for it not to be.
*  That's what the debt limit showed.
*  You have to have a bipartisan solution.
*  Chuck Schumer has been saying for weeks and even Mitch McConnell saying for weeks has
*  to be bipartisan.
*  So it's going to have to be that.
*  And then at that point, we'll see how bad it is for Kevin McCarthy.
*  Right.
*  And again, almost by definition, it will be bad for Kevin McCarthy.
*  And then he will have only delayed this inevitable showdown that he fears so much that
*  could endanger this job.
*  He loves so much.
*  Right.
*  Unfortunately, all of that's being discussed is only a temporary solution.
*  The most viable resolution of this now being discussed is in the Senate with both Republican
*  and Democratic support.
*  But even that one only funds the government through November 17th.
*  So we're going to be having this fight.
*  Again, you're saying we're going to be having this fight again.
*  Again, maybe multiple times actually.
*  So the showdown for Kevin McCarthy is coming.
*  The only question is when does it come and does he survive it?
*  Well, Carl, thank you very much.
*  I assume we will be speaking with you again at some point in the next week.
*  Unfortunately, that's probably true.
*  I mean, yeah, I think this is going to be a persistent issue.
*  Right.
*  Well, Carl, thank you very much.
*  Thanks, Michael.
*  On Thursday afternoon, after we spoke with Carl, the US government began to formally notify
*  federal workers that a government shutdown now appears to be imminent.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  I do not believe that the current evidence would support articles of impeachment.
*  That is something that an inquiry has to establish.
*  On Thursday, during the first hearing of House Republicans' impeachment inquiry into President
*  Biden, the star witnesses testified that Republicans lacked proof that Biden has committed
*  impeachable offenses.
*  I am not here today to even suggest that there was corruption fraud or any wrongdoing.
*  In my opinion, more information needs to be gathered and assessed before I would make
*  such an assessment.
*  House Republicans are seeking to show that Biden is improperly linked to his son's overseas
*  business dealings, but have struggled to find such evidence.
*  That prompted a Democrat involved in the hearing, Representative Jamie Raskin, to mock the
*  proceeding as a waste of time.
*  If the Republicans had a smoking gun or even a dripping water pistol, they would be presenting
*  it today, but they've got nothing on Joe Biden.
*  All they can do is return to the story.
