# A New Child Labor Crisis in America

*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernice and this is the Daily.
*  A Times investigation has found that migrant children are working in some of the most dangerous
*  jobs in the country, in slaughterhouses, on construction sites, and in factories, making
*  products for some of the best-known American brands.
*  Today, my colleague Hannah Dreyer, on the failures that have led to a crisis in child labor,
*  and now that it's been exposed, what the government plans to do about it.
*  It's Thursday, March 9th.
*  So Hannah, you've been investigating child migrant labor in this country for nearly a year
*  now, and you've come out with some pretty remarkable reporting.
*  So tell me how you came to this story.
*  What made you start looking into it?
*  This is actually something that I've been thinking about for years.
*  I've been reporting on immigration for more than 10 years, and back in 2018, I was doing
*  some reporting into Trump era raids on undocumented teenagers.
*  I realized that a lot of the teenagers I was reporting on were working overnight shifts,
*  making cookies for a nationally distributed brand.
*  And this is sort of an open secret in the immigration world.
*  People know that a lot of the kids who crossed the border on their own end up working.
*  So when I started at the Times last year, I was thinking about looking into this again,
*  and I assume that these kids would mostly be working in agriculture, maybe some would
*  be washing dishes.
*  But what I found when I really started getting on the ground was something totally different.
*  These are kids working factory jobs in a lot of cases, factories that supply some of the
*  biggest brands, fruit of the loom, Ford, general motors, J-Crew.
*  We found them producing milk for Ben and Jerry's, packaging Cheerios and Cheetos.
*  And these are often dangerous jobs.
*  The kids who packaged hot Cheetos, for example, told me that their lungs burn from inhaling
*  that spicy dust for 10 hours at a time.
*  I found kids who've had their legs ripped off by industrial machines, who've lost fingers,
*  kids working construction, who've fallen from five-story buildings.
*  God.
*  And when I started this reporting, I was expecting to find, you know, a handful of children
*  who had ended up in this kind of exploitation, but the experts who I'm talking to estimate
*  this is more like in the hundreds of thousands.
*  Wow.
*  I personally spoke with 100 children who have recently crossed the border, been released
*  to adults, and are now working in jobs that violate child labor laws.
*  And how did you find the kids you interviewed, Hannah?
*  You know, it was actually pretty easy to find these kids.
*  Usually I would get to a new town and by the next day I would be talking to migrant children
*  who are working in violation of child labor laws.
*  Go on.
*  Was this Facebook?
*  Yeah.
*  Was it Skyline?
*  It's been a lot of time outside of factories at shift changes, so just going to factory
*  parking lots at midnight or at 6.30 in the morning.
*  So we're not allowed people, I think we'll tell people how to do so, right?
*  I'm just racking up with them.
*  No, they have to go.
*  They have to go.
*  Sometimes I would get kicked out by security guards, but even then I would sort of go across
*  the street and catch these kids as they were coming off shift.
*  Seraphos, y de mandarte, un mensaje para que tengas mi n√∫mero?
*  A pattern that I was really seeing was that kids were working the overnight shift so that
*  they could go to school during the day.
*  Kids would often have the same backpacks that they were using at school the next morning
*  around their shoulders.
*  Wow.
*  I mean, these are not the kind of things you think of as happening to children in the US,
*  in the workforce.
*  Help me understand Hannah, what's going on here.
*  As you said, we have laws preventing kids from doing this kind of work.
*  So why are these kids ending up in these situations?
*  What we're looking at is really a system failure.
*  And as an investigative reporter, I tend to try to focus on sort of one bad actor, one policy
*  failure.
*  And I tried to do that in this reporting, but really, we're looking at at least three systems
*  that have failed these children.
*  Walk me through those failures.
*  Where do we begin?
*  So the first failure really starts with the federal government.
*  They're the ones who are ultimately responsible for figuring out what happens with a child
*  who crosses the border.
*  So these children are not undocumented.
*  They actually cross the border, turn themselves into an official, and are then taken to
*  a government shelter, and their caseworkers figure out if there's any adults already in
*  this country who can take that child in.
*  That is more and more children have crossed the border.
*  The government has come under huge pressure to try to get these kids released faster than
*  they ever have before.
*  And why is that?
*  Why are there so many more children coming now?
*  So the number of kids coming north has really exploded since the pandemic.
*  And that's partly because the pandemic hit Central American economies really hard.
*  So kids are fleeing a number of things, but they're really fleeing poverty.
*  Most kids are coming from Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.
*  And even in these remote villages, places where you don't even get cell phone reception,
*  people are looking around and noticing that the only families able to afford food or
*  cars or running water, where the one's living off of remittances, money from people in
*  the US to their families back home.
*  That's right.
*  And a lot of families are sending their kids north because they think it'll be better for
*  the kids, or they hope the kids might be able to send remittances back.
*  So in 2021, more than 150,000 children crossed the border alone.
*  That is completely unprecedented.
*  It's more than three times as many as we're coming in five years ago.
*  So that's a huge jump.
*  And these kids are coming without their parents?
*  They're coming alone.
*  And that's because the adults in these villages know that if they try to come up and cross
*  the border, they will most likely be turned away.
*  But if the kid shows up by themselves, they'll probably be let in.
*  And this goes back to a US policy of never turning away a child who crosses the border
*  by themselves.
*  Instead, the US lets those kids come in and stay usually for several years while they
*  apply for asylum.
*  And the idea there was you don't want to turn a kid away at the border and then have
*  some child alone in a Mexican border town where anything might happen to them.
*  Okay, so all these kids are showing up at the border.
*  And this is 2021, which of course is the first year of the Biden administration.
*  So I imagine that this problem is pretty high on his list of priorities.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  This was an early political crisis for Biden.
*  The Secretary of Homeland Security warned today, quote, we are on pace to encounter more
*  individuals on the Southwest border than we have in the last 20 years.
*  One of the biggest concerns, of course, are the unaccompanied Miner C's children that
*  are surging to the border that end up being held in customs and border protection facilities
*  that are not designed to house children.
*  Democratic Congressman Henry Quayar released these pictures showing unaccompanied migrant
*  children sleeping on floors in a crowded border patrol facility in Texas.
*  There are all these photos of kids sleeping under those metal space blankets, sleeping
*  on the floors.
*  And kids haven't seen sunlight in days.
*  Others are taking turns showering, often going days without them.
*  There are more children coming across the border than we have facilities for at this point
*  in time.
*  And these kids were there because the government didn't have capacity to take all these kids
*  who were coming across the border into shelters.
*  And so they were sort of piling up at these jail-like facilities.
*  As of tonight, there are now 4,200 children in custody, which dwarfs the number at the
*  peak of the 2019 border crisis.
*  They of course separated themselves from the Trump era policies when it comes to immigration.
*  So it begs the question, why would they not prepare for that?
*  And so the Biden administration was under all this pressure to move these kids out of detention
*  more quickly.
*  And that pressure ended up falling squarely on the Department of Health and Human Services,
*  which is the agency that's ultimately responsible for figuring out who's going to take all of these
*  kids in the long term.
*  So Hannah, explain how things normally work with these kids when it comes to HHS.
*  And what does that pressure mean for this process?
*  So when a child crosses the border alone, the first thing that HHS does is ask that child
*  who they could possibly live with in the US.
*  And usually the child will have a phone number written on a piece of paper or some idea
*  of somebody who might be able to take them in.
*  And HHS will then call that person and do some sort of vetting to make sure that the
*  person is who they say they are, make sure that they intend to take care of the child,
*  make sure they maybe knew the child back in their home country.
*  And when everything goes well, kids are released to a sponsor who's usually a family member,
*  sometimes a family friend.
*  And that sponsor does what they said they would do.
*  They'll take care of the kids and them to school, give them a room to live in.
*  That's sort of how this is supposed to go.
*  Right. But how is it actually working in practice?
*  So the case managers who work at HHS tell me that they started rolling back protections
*  that had been in place for years, really rushing through the vetting of these sponsors.
*  They got rid of some background checks.
*  They got rid of some interview questions.
*  They really started pairing back the normal vetting that they had been doing to make sure
*  that adults could actually take care of these kids and were actually who they said they were.
*  This was very upsetting to some of the staff and some even sent a letter all the way to the bosses
*  at the agency saying, we don't think that this is safe for kids.
*  We think we're releasing them to people who might traffic them.
*  Wow.
*  But the message from the top was still we need to get these kids out of shelters
*  and release the sponsors as quickly as possible.
*  And what people who work at HHS have told us is they would wake up every morning
*  just praying that the discharge numbers, the numbers of these kids going to sponsors
*  looked good for them that day.
*  The programs would start getting in trouble if they weren't releasing at least 20% of kids every week.
*  It's simple math.
*  It's addition and subtraction.
*  We actually got access to a recording of an internal meeting
*  where Secretary Javier Bacera is berating staff for moving too slowly.
*  If Henry Ford had seen this in his class, he would have never become famous and rich.
*  This is not the way he'd do an assembly line.
*  He's telling staff something that we're told he often would say,
*  which is you need to move this like an assembly line.
*  We need to get discharges up.
*  Every time we have to go to the Hill and explain why we're spending so much money,
*  when most people are struggling to spend a little bit of money for the kids on a daily basis,
*  we try to explain how we're spending more than a thousand dollars a day
*  for kids who may not even have the legal rights to be here.
*  Not me.
*  Whoa.
*  That's pretty remarkable.
*  I mean, it was super upsetting for some senior level people
*  who've been working in this agency for years and years.
*  Some of these senior staff told me that they felt more worried for these kids
*  even than they had under Trump.
*  So basically, there's this franticness, right, within HHS,
*  prompted mostly by the politics, it sounds like,
*  to get these kids out of government custody as fast as possible.
*  So what happens to the kids next after they leave US custody and go to their sponsors?
*  This is really the second failure that I saw in my reporting.
*  There's a whole host of issues with who these sponsors are
*  and how they end up treating the children in their care.
*  I spent a few months talking to one child, Carolina.
*  She had been living alone with her grandmother, who was getting sick
*  in a remote village in Guatemala.
*  And after the pandemic, they often didn't have enough food.
*  They didn't have running water.
*  And she decided to come to the US alone last year when she was 14.
*  Wow.
*  And at a shelter in Arizona,
*  HHS case workers called her aunt, living in Michigan.
*  Carolina didn't know this aunt.
*  They had barely ever talked.
*  They had never met.
*  And the aunt's first reaction was,
*  I don't want to take this girl in.
*  The aunt had already sponsored two other children.
*  And she told case workers that she was living on $600 a week.
*  But HHS went back to her because Carolina really didn't know
*  anybody else in this country.
*  And eventually, the aunt agreed to take Carolina in.
*  But she made clear that she would have to work and contribute
*  because she really couldn't support another child.
*  So this aunt is a direct relative of Carolina's.
*  But she's never met her before, doesn't know her.
*  And has financial troubles of her own.
*  But despite all of that, HHS still pushes her to take Carolina.
*  That's right.
*  And this is a very common situation
*  because the agency is under pressure itself
*  to get the kids out of custody.
*  And a lot of people think it's traumatic
*  for kids to spend more time in custody
*  than is absolutely necessary.
*  So even though the aunt is reluctant
*  about taking Carolina in, HHS releases Carolina to Michigan.
*  Okay, so that's Carolina's situation.
*  But at least she had a phone number of someone
*  who was a relative.
*  What about somebody who doesn't?
*  Yeah, thousands of these children are now going
*  to people who aren't related at all.
*  These are sometimes family friends
*  and sometimes they're complete strangers.
*  I spoke with one child, Neri,
*  who met his sponsor when he was 13 years old.
*  He was living in Guatemala
*  and started talking to this man on Facebook.
*  The man said that if you wanted to come to the US,
*  you would take care of him, he would send him to school.
*  And so Neri crossed the border on his own.
*  He went through HHS custody and was released to this man.
*  When he showed up, the man said that he was now
*  on the hook for paying back $4,000.
*  That was what the man was charging
*  for helping him come to the US.
*  The man also started charging him for the paperwork
*  that he had to send to HHS
*  to get him released from custody.
*  And he was also charging huge interest on these debts.
*  So this is a 13 year old who meets somebody on Facebook
*  and comes based on that incredibly tenuous connection.
*  Like where is HHS in all of this?
*  Do they ever check in on the kids
*  to make sure the sponsors are actually taking care of them?
*  HHS makes one phone call after these children are released.
*  They call about 30 days after they're released
*  to try to get in touch with children
*  and make sure that they're doing okay.
*  What we found is that a third of children
*  never even answer that first phone call.
*  So 85,000 kids have been lost immediately
*  just over the last two years.
*  Case workers tell us that they wish
*  that there was a lot more follow up on the other end.
*  Like if you're going to release kids quickly,
*  at least provide a lot of sort of checks and balances
*  for them once they're living out in the world.
*  But for now, all most kids get is the number for a hotline.
*  And this is supposed to be a place
*  where they can report abuse and exploitation.
*  But what we found was that the hotline did not have a policy
*  of returning these children's calls.
*  So what was happening was children would call to say,
*  I'm being put to work by my sponsor.
*  And instead of following up,
*  the hotline operators would pass that on
*  to local law enforcement.
*  And children were telling us that they called to report
*  just horrible exploitation.
*  And we're never hearing anything back.
*  Whoa, it's like what's the point of the hotline then?
*  I mean, that's what some of these kids told me.
*  I spoke to one kid who had been sleeping in a basement
*  with three cameras watching him at all times,
*  forced to work around the clock.
*  God.
*  He told me that when he called the hotline,
*  he at least expected somebody to come to his house,
*  maybe knock on the door and rescue him.
*  Instead, he ended up escaping himself.
*  Whoa.
*  So stepping back here for a second,
*  because HHS is moving so fast to release
*  these children to sponsors,
*  not every sponsor is properly vetted.
*  So not only do you get sponsors like Carolinas
*  who don't really have the resources to actually support them,
*  you also get sponsors who are exploiting kids to make money.
*  And because HHS loses contact with a lot of these kids,
*  once they're off in the world with their sponsor,
*  they're more or less on their own.
*  That's exactly where we're at.
*  Even the children who've come into this country
*  knowing that they're going to have to work
*  have no way to imagine the kind of pressure
*  that they're going to be under.
*  And so what we've been seeing is children
*  who really feel like they have no option
*  but to go out and get whatever kind of job they can
*  as quickly as they can.
*  And that means finding employers
*  who are willing to hire children.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Hannah, you just told us that many of these migrant kids need to work.
*  But many kids in the US do work, right?
*  Like that's not necessarily that unusual.
*  Can you remind us what the law says
*  about kids working in the US?
*  Totally.
*  So kids are allowed to work starting at around 14.
*  I had a job when I was a young teenager.
*  I know you probably had a job.
*  Yes, I did.
*  I worked picking blueberries in the summertime
*  because I grew up in a rural place.
*  Exactly.
*  A summer job.
*  It's really normal and it's legal.
*  Which child labor laws are really intended
*  to prevent our children working when they should be in school,
*  are working so late that they're not getting enough sleep.
*  And some professions are banned because they're too dangerous.
*  These are the kinds of jobs that I've been focusing on.
*  So that's factories, slaughterhouses, construction sites sometimes.
*  I wanted to understand how migrant children were ending up
*  in the most dangerous jobs that are banned for kids.
*  And what did you find, Hannah,
*  when you started really looking into these jobs?
*  So this is really failure number three.
*  The supply chain in the US has become very complicated.
*  And a lot of the biggest brands in this country hire workers
*  through a manufacturer that then hires them
*  through staffing companies.
*  So there's a lot of separation between the brand and the worker.
*  For example, Carolina, who we talked about earlier,
*  who came here when she was 14, was making Cheerios.
*  For General Mills.
*  But she wasn't working for General Mills.
*  OK, who was she working for?
*  She was working at a supplier called
*  Hearthside Food Solutions, which is in Grand Rapids.
*  And it makes and packages food for some
*  of the biggest brands in the country.
*  This is a plant that has the kind of conveyor belts
*  that rip off fingers.
*  And there have been 34 federal safety violations
*  just in the past several years.
*  Carolina was working eight hour shifts.
*  And then going to school for eight hours.
*  And just over the course of the months
*  that I was talking to her, she went from going to school
*  every day to often staying at home,
*  because her stomach was hurting.
*  She said she just didn't feel well.
*  Other kids in her class dropped out just over those few months
*  because they said that they weren't getting enough sleep.
*  And they'd rather just work overtime packing Cheerios
*  and Chewy bars than try to balance that huge workload.
*  But while Carolina was making Cheerios for General Mills
*  and doing this grueling work at a Hearthside factory,
*  she wasn't even actually hired by Hearthside.
*  She was hired by an outside staffing agency
*  that was hiring a lot of other migrant children
*  and then sending them all to work for this manufacturer.
*  Wow, so very complicated employment structure.
*  It's like this whole series of kind of Russian nesting
*  dolls in a way, right?
*  And it seems like a natural structure
*  for each of those employment layers to deflect blame.
*  Exactly.
*  When I got in touch with these companies
*  to say that we had found a factory full of children,
*  Hearthside blamed the staffing agency,
*  the staffing agency blamed Hearthside
*  and General Mills blamed both of them.
*  But is there plausible deniability, Hannah?
*  I mean, could they genuinely not know
*  that kids were making things at their facilities?
*  So the companies have told us that they had no idea
*  this was happening.
*  These kids are generally using sort of cheap fake ideas
*  that will have a different name and a different age.
*  Whether or not they knew really doesn't matter
*  in the eyes of the law, the government can come in
*  and hold the staffing agency, the manufacturer,
*  and the brand accountable.
*  And former employees have actually told us
*  that at least some supervisors absolutely knew
*  what was going on, that Hearthside knew
*  what was going on, that the staffing agency knew
*  it was dealing with children, and they chose to put
*  those kids into these plans anyway.
*  These companies had an incentive to look the other way.
*  It's a very tight labor market.
*  And some HR managers told me that they're desperate
*  for workers.
*  These are not desirable jobs.
*  The hours are terrible.
*  The pay is bad.
*  And these are dangerous jobs that even adult workers
*  might not want to do because of the risk of serious injury,
*  which presumably children have a higher risk of
*  because they're less experienced and smaller.
*  Absolutely.
*  Across the board, children are twice as likely
*  to be injured in any kind of job.
*  I came across one case of a 15-year-old who died
*  on his first day of a roofing job.
*  He fell 50 feet.
*  Here in Brooklyn, a 14-year-old was killed a few years ago
*  while he was working as a food delivery messenger.
*  He was run over in traffic.
*  One child was killed by a 35-ton earth mover
*  that he was driving.
*  He fell out and was crushed.
*  I mean, this is why child labor laws exist.
*  And Hannah, why aren't they being enforced?
*  So the federal Department of Labor is supposed
*  to enforce all child labor laws.
*  But what people who work there tell me is that they're
*  really overwhelmed.
*  They're short staffed and they're just struggling
*  to keep up with other kinds of labor violations
*  tips that come in.
*  And even when inspectors do find a child labor violation,
*  the fines top out at $15,000, which is really nothing
*  for some of these bigger companies.
*  So it sounds like there are these disparate patches
*  of problems.
*  Failures at multiple levels, they're just kind of disconnected
*  and diffuse.
*  And as a result, tens of thousands of kids
*  just kind of walked through the door
*  into American society and into dangerous jobs
*  all over the country.
*  That's really what my reporting has shown.
*  And people often say that this is something
*  that's hiding in plain sight.
*  But I mean, it's barely hiding.
*  It is in plain sight.
*  It's just that no one's really looking at it, right?
*  Exactly.
*  So what's the response then to your story, Hannah?
*  I mean, to their credit, the government's response
*  to this story was immediate.
*  The Biden administration is taking action
*  against the growing epidemic of migrant children
*  working in violation of child labor laws.
*  Child labor is abuse, and it is unacceptable.
*  Again, it is unacceptable.
*  Two days after the story published,
*  the Biden administration announced sweeping changes
*  and began really cracking down on migrant child labor.
*  And today, the Department of Labor and HHS
*  announced that they will create a new interagency task force
*  to combat child exploitation.
*  The Department of Labor is now going to start
*  proactively looking for these migrant child labor
*  cases around the country.
*  They will also increase scrutiny of companies
*  that do business with employers who violate child labor laws.
*  And is also pledging to hold the actual corporations
*  to account not just sort of the low-level staff agencies.
*  Hope in New Coday recent New York Times reports
*  of their investigation, which put a spotlight
*  in the vast use of migrant child labor across states
*  and across industries.
*  Congress has already drawn up and introduced legislation
*  that would increase penalties for child labor.
*  Of course, I read the same article
*  that you're talking about.
*  I was horrified.
*  If that legislation passes, supervisors could go to jail
*  for a year for hiring children.
*  But health and human services, which is arguably the agency
*  that bears the most responsibility for this,
*  is telling us the least.
*  They have at least fixed the hotline.
*  That children were calling to report abuse,
*  where operators were not calling children back.
*  But we are still sort of waiting to see what HHS might do.
*  And what about the companies?
*  Are they taking any action?
*  The big name companies are under a lot of pressure to fix this.
*  They're hearing from customers and also from members
*  of Congress.
*  But remember, the kids were not working directly
*  for these national corporations.
*  They were working for the suppliers.
*  So companies like General Mills tell us
*  that they're investigating their suppliers right now
*  and are going to take action after those investigations.
*  The suppliers, meanwhile, have been stopping production lines
*  so that they can basically go and look for children.
*  And when they find kids, they're firing them.
*  So Hannah, this is a lot of talk of action here.
*  But where does this leave the kids?
*  I mean, a lot of the kids do come to this country to work.
*  They need to make money to send home to their families.
*  And if they can't work, that might not necessarily
*  help them either.
*  So some of their reforms might prevent
*  this kind of child labor in the future.
*  But there are hundreds of thousands of kids
*  who are already here and working.
*  And advocates have been proposing
*  some bigger solutions to this problem.
*  One thing every major group that works with these kids
*  has called for is some way to bring them out of the shadows
*  so that these kids could work legally.
*  There are lots of jobs that these kids could be doing that
*  are gentler, that are less dangerous,
*  but would still let them send money home.
*  But those are jobs for more reputable places
*  that are going to require proper documentation.
*  You can't get them using fake IDs,
*  what you need as a work permit, which
*  is a document that gives immigrants
*  the legal authorization to work in the US.
*  OK, and could they not have gotten it before?
*  You know, in theory, they could have applied for one.
*  But in practice, this is something that takes a lawyer
*  because these are children who don't speak English.
*  Some of them don't even speak Spanish as their first language.
*  And it's a somewhat complicated process
*  to request one of these permits.
*  So advocates are saying that what we need to do
*  is provide these kids at least with basic legal services
*  so that they can get started on this process.
*  And when I checked in this week with the kids
*  who I've been talking to for this reporting,
*  one of them, Carolina, was actually
*  in the process of taking a step toward getting her work permit.
*  She had gotten connected with a lawyer
*  who's helping her pro bono.
*  So she could soon be working one of these safer jobs
*  at a grocery store or a restaurant.
*  The other kids who I've talked to are really
*  in the process of finding another job in this shadow economy.
*  A lot of them have been let go from the places
*  that they were working, but it's not
*  as if they're going to stop working.
*  So I talked to one kid who had been working for JBS,
*  which is the world's largest meat processing plant.
*  Now he's working for a no-name meat processing factory
*  at Town Over.
*  I talked to a kid who had been working
*  at a Ford supplier.
*  Now he's working at a different kind of factory.
*  They haven't had trouble finding new jobs.
*  They're still working and they really sound just as desperate
*  as they were two weeks ago.
*  Hannah, you spent a year investigating this.
*  They're traveling around the country,
*  talking to kids, talking to sponsors,
*  talking to case workers.
*  What ultimately did you take away from this reporting?
*  Like what did you come to understand
*  about immigration and employment in children
*  in a way that you hadn't before?
*  To me, it was sort of a lesson in well-full blindness.
*  And this is something that I've heard
*  from a lot of the law enforcement officials
*  and case workers who work most closely
*  with these children.
*  They're really disturbed by what they see
*  as people turning a blind eye
*  to these kids who are really in our midst
*  and not that hard to see when you're looking for them.
*  I'm also thinking about the children
*  who are still in Guatemala and in Central America,
*  who will be crossing the border soon.
*  This summer we'll surely see another wave
*  of these kids coming over.
*  And I really worry for the kind of situations
*  I'm gonna end up in.
*  Hannah, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Wednesday.
*  The department has concluded that there is
*  reasonable cause to believe that Louisville Metro
*  and LMPD engaged in a pattern or practice of conduct
*  that violates the first and fourth amendments
*  of the Constitution.
*  A two-year investigation by the Department of Justice
*  into the Louisville Kentucky Police Department
*  found broad patterns of discriminatory practices,
*  including the use of excessive force
*  and searches based on so-called no-knock warrants.
*  The investigation was prompted by the fatal shooting
*  of Breonna Taylor by the police in Louisville in 2020.
*  Attorney General Merrick Garland, a period Louisville,
*  announced an agreement to overhaul practices.
*  He said had led to systematic discrimination
*  against black people.
*  And the Pentagon is blocking the Biden administration
*  from sharing information about Russian atrocities
*  in Ukraine with the International Criminal Court
*  in the Hague.
*  American military leaders oppose helping the court
*  investigate Russians because they fear setting a precedent
*  that might help pave the way for the court
*  to prosecute Americans.
