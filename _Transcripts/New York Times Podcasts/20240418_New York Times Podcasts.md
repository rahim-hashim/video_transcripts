# The Opening Days of Trumpâ€™s First Criminal Trial
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfqS2gMB8kQ)
*  It's the first day of the Trump trial.
*  Just walking out the door of my house.
*  It's a beautiful day. 6-11 a.m.
*  The thing that keeps running through my head is it's kind of amazing that
*  hundreds of jurors are going to show up at
*  the Manhattan courthouse and some of them are going to know what they're there for.
*  Probably talking to their friends, their relatives about it.
*  Some of them are going to learn this morning.
*  Talking to other jurors in line. Asking what all the fuss is about.
*  But I really do imagine that there's going to be at least one potential juror
*  who, you know, headphones on, getting into court.
*  Here they're going to be there for the first criminal trial of Donald J. Trump and just
*  I mean how would you react?
*  From the New York Times
*  I'm Michael Bobarro. This is The Daily.
*  Today.
*  What it's been like inside the lower Manhattan courtroom where
*  political and legal history are being made.
*  My colleague Jonah Bromwich on the opening days of the first
*  criminal trial of a U.S. president.
*  It's Thursday, April 18th.
*  Is that his mic? Hi there.
*  How are you? I'm doing good.
*  Okay. Thank you for coming in Jonah.
*  Thank you for having me. In the middle of a trial. Can you just explain why you're able to even be here?
*  Sure. So we happen to be off on Wednesdays during trial.
*  We being not the New York Times but the courts. That's right. Which is why we're taping with you.
*  And because we now have two full
*  court days of this history making trial now under our belts.
*  And the thing about this trial that's so interesting is that there are no cameras
*  in the courtroom for the wider world. There's no audio recordings.
*  So all we really have is you and your eyes and your notebook.
*  Maybe your laptop. And so we're hoping you can
*  reconstruct for us the scene of the first two days of this trial.
*  And really the highlights. Yeah I'd be happy to. So on Monday morning
*  I left the subway. It's before 7am. The sun is just rising over
*  these grandiose court buildings in lower Manhattan.
*  I'm about to turn left onto Center Street. I'm right in front of the big municipal building.
*  And I turn onto Center Street. That's where the courthouses are.
*  I'm crossing. And I expected to see a big crowd.
*  And it was even bigger than I had anticipated.
*  Oh here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
*  Now I finally see the crowd. You have camera banks. You have reporters.
*  You have the beginnings of what will eventually become a protest.
*  And you have this most New York thing which is just a big crowd of people.
*  Who just know something is going on. That's right.
*  And what they know is going on is of course the first trial of an American president.
*  Alright I'm passing the camera folks.
*  Camera, camera, camera, camera. Here we go.
*  I want to get right to ABC's Aaron Kutursky who's outside of the courthouse.
*  Robert Costa is following it outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan.
*  Bob I saw the satellite trucks lined up all in a row. Good morning.
*  Talk to us how we got here exactly.
*  So this is the case that was brought by the Manhattan District Attorney.
*  So prosecutors have accused Donald Trump of covering up the actions of his former
*  fixer Michael Cohen after Cohen paid hush money to Stormy Daniels.
*  Stormy Daniels had a story about having had sex with Donald Trump
*  which Trump has always denied. Cohen paid her money.
*  And then Trump reimbursed Cohen. And prosecutors say that
*  Trump essentially defrauded the American people because he hid this information
*  that could have been very important for the election from those people
*  when he reimbursed Cohen. Right. And as I remember it, he also misrepresented
*  what that reimbursement was. Claimed it was
*  a legal fee when in fact it was just reimbursing Michael Cohen
*  for a hush money payment. Exactly. He definitely didn't say reimbursement for hush money payment
*  to Stormy Daniels. It's a cover up case. It's a case about hiding information
*  you don't want people to see. Right. And of course the context
*  of all this is that it is in the middle of a presidential election. It's 2016.
*  Trump wants to keep this secret prosecutors allege
*  so that the American public doesn't know about it and potentially hold it against him.
*  Right. And prosecutors are telling a story about election interference. They're saying that Trump
*  interfered with an election. And Trump himself is also using
*  the phrase election interference. But he's painting the trial itself
*  as election interference as he now runs again in 2024.
*  And because we're in Manhattan and because the jury pool is going to be
*  largely democratic and the judge is a democrat and the district attorney is
*  a democrat, Trump keeps claiming he cannot get a fair shake.
*  This is Democrat Central and in Democrat Central Trump doesn't have a chance.
*  Okay. So what happens once you actually enter the
*  courthouse? Outside there's all this fanfare.
*  But inside it's a little bit business as usual. So I go up to
*  the 15th floor and I walk into the courtroom and I sit down
*  and it's the same old courtroom and we're sitting and waiting for the former
*  president. Around 930 Trump walks in. He looks
*  thin. He looks a little tired, kind of slumping forward as if to
*  say with his body, like, let's get this over with. Here we go. The judge
*  walks in a little bit after that and we think we're all set
*  for the trial to start. But that's not what happens here. And in fact there are
*  a series of legal arguments about what the trial is going to look like
*  and what evidence is going to be allowed in. So for example,
*  prosecutors ask that they be allowed to admit into evidence headlines
*  from the National Enquirer that were attacks on Trump's 2016
*  opponents. On Ted Cruz, on Marco Rubio, on Ben Carson.
*  Why? Because prosecutors are in some sense putting Trump's
*  2016 campaign on trial. These headlines are a big part of that
*  because what prosecutors say they show is that Trump had this ongoing
*  deal with the National Enquirer and the publisher would promote him and
*  it would publish damaging stories about his opponents and then crucially
*  it would protect Trump from negative stories. And that's exactly what prosecutors say
*  happened with Stormy Daniels. That the National Enquirer tipped Cohen off about
*  Stormy Daniels trying to sell her story of having had sex with Donald Trump, which he denies
*  and that led to the hush money payment to her. So what prosecutors are doing overall
*  with these headlines is establishing a pattern of conduct and that
*  conduct, they say, was an attempt to influence the election in Trump's favor.
*  And the judge agrees he's going to admit this evidence. And this is
*  a pretty big win for the prosecution. But even though they win that one, they're not winning
*  everything. They lose some important arguments here. One of them was that
*  after the Access Hollywood tape came out, there were allegations
*  of sexual assault against Donald Trump. And you know this
*  Michael because you reported two of them. Two of the three in question at this very trial.
*  Prosecutors had hoped to talk about those during trial in front of the
*  jury to show the jurors that the Trump campaign
*  was really, really focused on pushing
*  back against bad press in the wake of the Access Hollywood tape
*  in which Trump seemed to describe sexual assault. That was a big problem for the campaign.
*  The campaign did everything it could to push back, including against these allegations that
*  surfaced in the wake of the tape. But the judge saying that the
*  allegations are hearsay, that they're based on the women's stories, says absolutely not.
*  That is incredibly prejudicial to the defendant. Meaning that
*  Donald Trump would actually not get a fair trial were those allegations
*  to be mentioned. And so he will not let those in. The jurors will not hear about
*  them. So this is a setback of course for the prosecution and victory for Trump's legal team. It's a setback
*  and it also just shows you how these pre-trial motions shape the context of the trial.
*  Think of the trial as a venue like a theater or athletic contest of some sort.
*  And these pre-trial motions are about what gets led into the arena
*  and what stays out. The sexual assault allegations, out. The National Enquirer
*  headlines in. Okay. And how is Trump sitting there
*  at the defense table reacting to these pre-trial motion
*  rulings from the judge? Well, as I've just
*  said, this is very important stuff for his trial. Right. Hugely important. But
*  it's all happening in legal language and I'm decoding
*  it for you. But if you were sitting there listening to it, you might get a little lost
*  and you might get a little bored. And Trump, who is not involved in these
*  arguments, seems to fall asleep.
*  Seems to fall asleep. You're seeing this with
*  your own eyes. What we're seeing overall, including our colleague Maggie
*  Haberman, who's in the overflow room and has a direct view of Trump's face, I'm sitting behind
*  him in the courtroom. So I can't see his face that well. You guys are double teaming this. That's right.
*  I'm sitting behind him, but Maggie's sitting in front of him. And what she sees is not only that his eyes are
*  closed. That wouldn't get you to he is asleep. And we have to be really careful
*  about reporting that he's asleep, even if it seems like a frivolous thing. But what happens
*  is that his head is dropping down to his chest and then it's snapping back
*  up. So you've seen that. I've done that.
*  Yeah. We all kind of know that feeling of snapping awake suddenly and we see
*  the head motion and it happens several times.
*  Lawyers kind of bothering him, not quite shaking him, but certainly
*  trying to get his attention. And that head snapping motion, we felt
*  confident enough to report that Trump fell asleep. During his own
*  criminal trials opening day.
*  That's right.
*  Does someone eventually wake him up? He wakes up. He wakes up. And in fact
*  in the afternoon he's much more animated. It's almost as if he wants to be seen
*  being very much awake. Right. So once these
*  pretrial motions are ruled on and Trump is, you know, snapped
*  back to attention, what happens? Well, what happens in the courtroom
*  is that the trial begins. The first trial of an American president is now
*  in session. And what marks that beginning is
*  jurors walking into the room one by one, many of them
*  kind of craning their necks over at Donald Trump, giggling, raising their eyebrows
*  at each other, filing into the room and being sworn in by the
*  judge. And that swearing in marks the
*  official beginning of the trial. The beginning is jury selection. And it's often
*  overlooked. It's not dramatized in our kind of courtroom dramas in the same
*  way. But it's so important. It's one of the most important
*  parts of the case. Because whoever sits on the jury, these are the 12
*  people who are going to decide whether Trump is guilty or whether
*  Trump is innocent. So how does jury selection
*  actually look and feel and go?
*  So jury selection is a winnowing process. And in order to do that,
*  you have to have these people go through a bunch of
*  different hurdles. So the first hurdle is after
*  the judge describes the case, he asks the group,
*  and there are just short of a hundred of them, whether they can be fair and impartial,
*  and says that if they can't, they should leave. And
*  more than half the group is instantly gone. Whoa. So after we
*  do this kind of big, mass excusal, we're left with a smaller group.
*  And so now jurors are getting called in smaller groups to
*  the jury box. And what they're going to do there is they're going to answer this questionnaire.
*  And this part of the process is really conducted by the judge. The lawyers
*  are involved. They're listening. But they're not yet asking questions of the jurors themselves.
*  And what's on the questionnaire? Well, it's 42 questions.
*  And the questions include their education, their professional
*  histories, their hobbies, what they like to do, whether you're
*  a member of QAnon or Antifa. Whether you're far left or far
*  right. That's right. Whether you've read The Art of the Deal, Trump's book, which some
*  prospective jurors have. Right, it was a best seller in its time. That's right. And some of
*  it can be answered in yes-no questions, but some of it can be answered
*  more at length. So some of the prospective jurors are going very, very fast.
*  Yes, no, no, no, yes. Right, because this is an oral questionnaire. That's right.
*  But some of them are taking their time. They're expanding on their hobbies.
*  So the potential juror in seat three, for example, is talking about her hobbies.
*  And she says some running, hiking. And then she said, I'd like to go to the club.
*  And it got a huge laugh. And you get that kind of
*  thing in jury selection, which is one of the reasons it's so fun. It's the height
*  of normality in this situation that is anything but normal.
*  Right. The most banal answer possible delivered in front of the former
*  president and current Republican nominee for president. Well, that's one of the
*  fascinating parts about all this, right, is that they're answering in front of Trump
*  and they're answering questions about Trump in front of Trump. He doesn't react
*  all that much. But whenever someone says they've read the Art of the Deal
*  and there are a few of those, he kind of nods appreciatively, smiles. He likes that.
*  It's very clear. Right. But because there are so many questions,
*  this is taking forever. Right. Especially when people are choosing
*  to answer and elaborate and digress. This is when you fall asleep.
*  This is when I would have fallen asleep if I were a normal person.
*  And by the end of the day, where does jury selection stand?
*  Well, the questionnaire is another device for shrinking that jury pool.
*  And so the questionnaire has almost these little obstacles or roadblocks, including
*  in fact, a question that jurors have seen before, whether they would have any
*  problem being fair and impartial. They asked it again. They're asked it again. And they're asked it in this
*  more individualized way. The judge is questioning them. They're responding.
*  So remember that woman who said she liked to go to the club, got a big laugh?
*  She reaches question 34. And question 34 reads, do you have any strong
*  opinions or firmly held beliefs about former President Donald Trump or the fact that he
*  is a current candidate for president that would interfere with your ability to be a fair and
*  impartial juror? She said yes. She does have an opinion that would prevent her
*  from being fair and impartial. And she too is excused.
*  So that's how it works. People answer the questionnaire and
*  they get excused in that way or they have a scheduling conflict once they reach the jury
*  box. And so to answer your question, Michael, at the
*  end of day one, given all these problems with the questionnaire and the length
*  of time it's taking to respond to and people getting dismissed based on their answers,
*  there is not a single juror seated for this trial.
*  And it's starting to look like this is going to be a
*  really hard case for which to find an impartial jury.
*  That's the feeling in the room, yeah.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Donald, let's turn to day two. What does jury
*  selection look like on Tuesday? So when the day
*  begins, it looks almost exactly like it looked when the day
*  ended on Monday. We're still with the questionnaire, getting some interesting
*  answers, but even though it feels like we're going slow, we are
*  going. And so we've gone from about 100 people
*  to now there's about 24 in the room, there's 18 in the jury box,
*  and by the time we hit lunch, all those people have answered all those questions
*  and we are ready for the next step in the process, which is voir dire.
*  And what it is is the heart of jury
*  selection. This is the point where the lawyers themselves finally get to interview the jurors.
*  And we get so much information from this moment because the
*  lawyers ask questions based on what they want out of the jurors. So the prosecution
*  is asking all these different kinds of questions. The first round of voir dire
*  is done by a guy named Joshua Steinglass, very experienced trial lawyer with the Manhattan
*  District Attorney's Office. And he's providing all these hypotheticals.
*  I'll give you one example because I found this one really, really interesting. He
*  provides a hypothetical about a man who wants his wife
*  killed and essentially hires a hitman to do it. And what he asks the jurors
*  is, if that case were before you, would you be able to see
*  that the man who hired the hitman was a part of this crime?
*  And of course, what he's really getting at is, can you accept
*  that even though Michael Cohen, Trump's fixer, made this payment,
*  Trump is the guy who hired him to do it?
*  That's right. If there are other people involved, will jurors still be able to see Donald
*  Trump's hands behind it all? Fascinating. And what were some of the responses?
*  People mostly said, yes, we accept that. So that's how the prosecution did it.
*  But the defense had a totally different method of
*  voir dire. They were very focused on their client and people's opinions about their client.
*  So what kind of questions do we get from them? So the lawyer, Todd Blanch, is asking
*  people, what do you make of President Trump? What do you think of President Trump?
*  And what are some of the responses to that? Well, there is this incredible exchange with one of the jurors
*  who absolutely refuses to give his opinion of Donald Trump.
*  They go back and forth and back and forth. And the juror keeps insisting, you don't need to
*  know my opinion of him. All you need to know is that I'm going to be fair and impartial, like I said.
*  And Blanch pushes and the guy pushes back.
*  And the only way the guy budges is he finally kind of confesses
*  almost at the end that, yes, I am a Democrat. And that's all we get.
*  And what ends up happening to this potential juror? Believe it or not, he got dismissed.
*  I can believe it.
*  And of course, it's worth saying that this guy and everybody else is being asked that
*  question just feet from Trump himself.
*  That's right. And you might think you were going to get a really kind of spicy
*  like popcorn emoji type exchange from that.
*  But because these are now jurors who have said they can be fair and impartial, who
*  to some extent want to be on this jury or at least wouldn't mind being on this jury,
*  they're being very restrained. Mostly what they are emphasizing,
*  much like that guy I just described did, is that they can be fair.
*  They can be impartial. There's one woman who gives this really remarkable
*  answer. She says, you know, I thought about this last night. I stayed up all night.
*  I couldn't sleep thinking about whether I could be fair.
*  It's really important to me. And I can. What ends up happening to that particular
*  juror? She's also dismissed. And she's dismissed without
*  any reason at all. The defense decides it doesn't like her, doesn't want her on the jury.
*  And they have a certain number of chances to just get rid of jurors.
*  No questions asked. Other jurors are getting dismissed for cause.
*  I'm doing air quotes with my hands, which means that the lawyers have argued they actually
*  revealed themselves through their answers or through old social media
*  posts which are brought up in the courtroom to be either non-credible,
*  meaning they've said they can be fair and they can't, or somehow too biased to be on the jury.
*  Wait, can I just dial into that for a second? Are lawyers researching
*  the jurors in real time going online and saying, I'm making this up,
*  but Jonah Bromwich is a potential juror and I'm going to go off into my
*  little corner of the courtroom and Google everything you've ever said. Is that what's happening in the room?
*  Yeah, there's a whole profession dedicated to that. It's called jury consultant.
*  And they're very good at finding information on people in a hurry. And it certainly looked as if they were in play.
*  Did a social media post end up getting anybody kicked off this jury?
*  Yes, there were posts from kind of 2016
*  era internet. You'll remember that time as a very heated
*  one on the internet. Facebook memes are a big thing. And so there's all kinds
*  of lock him up type memes and rhetoric. And some of the
*  potential jurors here have used those and those jurors are dismissed
*  for a reason. Fascinating. So we have these two types of dismissals, right?
*  We have these peremptory dismissals, no reason at all given, and we have four
*  cause dismissals. And the process is called jury selection.
*  But you don't actually get selected for a jury. The thing is to make
*  it through all these obstacles. You're kind of you're left over. Right. And so
*  when certain jurors are not dismissed and they've made it through all these stages,
*  by the end of the day, we've gone from zero jurors seated
*  to seven jurors who will be participating in Donald Trump's trial.
*  Got it. And without going through all seven, just give us a little bit of a sketch of
*  who so far is on this jury. What stands out?
*  Well, not that much stands out. So we've got four men. We've got three women. You know, one
*  lives on the Upper East Side, one lives in Chelsea. Obviously, they're from all over Manhattan.
*  They have these kind of very normal hobbies like spending time with family
*  and friends. They have somewhat anonymous jobs. We've got two lawyers.
*  We've got someone who's worked in sales. So there's not
*  that much identifying information. And that's not an accident. One of the
*  things that often happens with jury selection, whether it be for Donald Trump or for anyone else,
*  is the most interesting jurors, the jurors that kind of catch your attention during the process,
*  they get picked off because they are being so interesting
*  that they interest one or the other side in a negative way, and soon
*  they're excused. So most of the jurors who are actually seated are not memorable.
*  Are not that memorable. Save one particular juror.
*  Okay. All right. I'll bite. What do I need to know about that one particular juror?
*  So let me tell you about a prospective juror who we knew as 374, who will now
*  be juror number five. She's a middle school teacher from Harlem, and she
*  said that she has friends who have really strong opinions about Trump, but
*  she herself does not. And she insisted several times, I am not a political
*  person. And then she said this thing that made me quite surprised that the prosecution
*  was fine with having her on the jury. She said, quote,
*  President Trump speaks his mind, and I'd rather that than someone who's in office
*  who you don't know what they're thinking. So she expressed
*  approval of President Trump. Yeah, it was mild approval. But the thing is,
*  especially for the defense in this trial, all you need is one juror.
*  One juror can tie up deliberations and nots,
*  and you can end with a hung jury. And this is actually
*  something that I saw firsthand. In 2019, I was the fourth person on a jury.
*  How do you like that? Yeah. And the trial was really complicated,
*  but I had thought while we were doing the trial, oh, this is going to be a really easy
*  decision. I thought the defendant in that case was guilty. So we get into deliberations,
*  but there's this one juror who keeps gumming up the works.
*  Every time we seem to be making progress, getting a conversation started,
*  this juror proverbially throws up his hands and says, I am not
*  convicting. This man is innocent. And we talked and we talked, and as the
*  fourth person, I was trying to use all my skills to mediate. But anytime we
*  made any progress, this guy would blow it up. And long story
*  short, hung jury, big victory for the defense lawyer.
*  And we come out of the room and she points at this juror, the defense lawyer,
*  points at this juror who blew everything up. And she said, I knew it.
*  I knew I had my guy. Okay. I don't want to read too much into what you said about
*  that one juror, but should I read between the lines to think that if there's a hung
*  jury, you wonder if it might be that juror? That's what
*  everyone in the courtroom is wondering, not just about this juror, but about every
*  single person who is selected. Is this the person who swings the case for me?
*  Is this the person who swings the case against me? These juries are
*  so complex. It's 12 people who don't know each other at the start
*  of the trial. And by the end of the trial have seen each other every morning and are
*  experiencing the same things, but are not allowed to have talked about the case
*  until deliberation start. In that moment, when deliberation start,
*  you're going to learn a whole lot about each other. That's right. There's this alchemical moment where suddenly
*  it all matters. Every personality selected matters. And that's why jury
*  selection is so important. And that's why these last two days are
*  actually one of the most important parts of this trial. Okay, so by my math, this trial
*  will require five more jurors to get to 12. I know also they're going to
*  need to be alternates. But from what you're saying, what looked like
*  a really uphill battle to get
*  an impartial jury or a jury that said it could be impartial
*  and Trump was very doubtful one could be found
*  has turned out to not be so hard to find. That's right. And in fact, we
*  went from thinking, oh boy, this is going awfully slowly, to
*  the judge himself saying we could be doing opening arguments as
*  soon as Monday morning. And I think that highlights something that's really fascinating
*  both about this trial and about the jury selection process overall.
*  One of the things that lawyers have been arguing about is whether or not
*  it's important to figure out what jurors' opinions about
*  Donald Trump are. And the prosecution and I think the judge have really
*  said no, that's not the key issue here. The key issue is not whether or not people have
*  opinions about Donald Trump. Right, who doesn't have an opinion about Donald Trump? Exactly. They're going to.
*  Automatically they're going to. The question is whether or not they can be fair and
*  impartial. And the seven people we already have seated
*  and presumably the five people that we're going to get over the next few days and
*  however many alternates we expect, six, are all going to have answered that
*  question. Not I hate Trump, I love Trump, but I can weigh in
*  on the former president's innocence or guilt and I can do it as fairly as
*  humanly possible. Now Trump is not happy about this.
*  He said after court yesterday, quote, we have a highly conflicted judge and he's
*  rushing this trial. And I think that he is going to see these beats of the system,
*  the criminal justice system, as it works on him as he is
*  experiencing it as unfair. That is typically how he talks about it
*  and how he views it. But what he's getting is what defendants
*  get. This is the system in New York, in the United States.
*  This is its answer to how do you pick a fair jury? Well you ask people,
*  can you be fair? And you put them through this process and the outcome is
*  12 people. And so I think we're going to see this
*  over and over again in this trial. We're going to see Trump experience the criminal justice system.
*  And its routines? Yeah, openings, witnesses, evidence,
*  closings. He's going to go through all of it. And I think at every
*  turn, it makes sense to expect him to say, well this is not fair.
*  Well the judge is doing something wrong. Well the prosecutors are doing something wrong. Well the jury
*  is doing something wrong. But at the end of the day, he's going to be a defendant
*  and he's going to sit mostly silently, if his lawyers
*  can make him do that, and watch this process play itself out.
*  So the system is going to try and treat him
*  like any other defendant. Even though, of course, he's not.
*  And he is going to fight back like no other defendant would.
*  Like no other defendant could. And that tension, him
*  pushing against the criminal justice system as it strives to treat him
*  as it would anyone else, is going to be a defining quality
*  of this trial.
*  Well Jonah, thank you very much. We appreciate it.
*  Of course. Thanks so much for having me.
*  P.S. Have you ever fallen asleep in a trial?
*  I have not. I figured.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need
*  to another day. It's clear the Israelis are
*  making a decision to act. We hope they do so in a way that does as little to
*  escalate this as possible. And in a way that as I said... During a visit to
*  Jerusalem on Wednesday, Britain's foreign secretary left little doubt
*  that Israel would retaliate against Iran for last weekend's aerial attack.
*  Despite pressure from the United States and the United
*  States and Britain to stand down. The question now is

*  House Republicans, at least two of whom have threatened to try to
*  oust Johnson over the plan.
*  I think providing lethal aid to Ukraine right now is critically important.
*  I really do. I really do.
