# The Biden Problem Democrats Can No Longer Ignore

*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Vabaro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  For months, Democrats have downplayed questions about President Biden's age and his memory.
*  That just got much harder to do.
*  My colleague, Peter Baker, explains.
*  It's Wednesday, February 14th.
*  Peter, when the Special Counsel report was released a few days ago and ignited into a national conversation about President Biden's age and memory, all of a third of the Daily thought of you because you've covered Biden for decades now.
*  You've seen him up close as a senator, as Vice President, now President.
*  You've watched him age.
*  And in your role as Chief White House correspondent, you've been examining what it means for Biden to be the oldest President in American history.
*  So I just want to start there with your own observations.
*  Well, yeah, the reality is that Joe Biden has age and it's hard not to notice.
*  And I think over the past few years, that aging has been a pronounced process.
*  There's a real change occurring, not surprising.
*  It's normal for somebody of his age.
*  Anyways, obviously he has healthy and vigorous as any 81 year old.
*  You can see, rise bikes, he exercises.
*  But it's hard not to notice when you watch him up close.
*  Well, just explain what you mean when you talk about this aging.
*  Like you said, everyone ages, but let's talk about the specifics of Biden aging care.
*  Well, there's the public presentation, right?
*  What you see when he shows up in the East Room, for instance, or the podium.
*  You see it in his gate, first thing out, right?
*  He's walking to the podium and he kind of shuffles now in derumes.
*  And he has taken a few falls recently.
*  You know, he once fell on his bike and that was recorded by cameras, which was embarrassing to him.
*  So that's the visual element. That's what we see.
*  And then, you know, there's also the verbal element.
*  To work hard to show patience and be willing to travel over a thousand miles.
*  You could say even this harder than getting a ticket to the Renaissance tour or a reprinted tour.
*  She's down and it's kind of warm in Brazil right now.
*  You can hear him in his extemporaneous speaking, sometimes trail off mid-sentence.
*  40% of all products coming into the United States of America and the West Coast go through Los Angeles and one of my doing here.
*  It's a long reach.
*  A long reach, thank you.
*  Or, you know, struggling to find his way back.
*  There is some movement and I don't want to choose my words.
*  There's some movement. There's been a response from the.
*  There's better response.
*  Again, that's not unusual for somebody of his age, but it comes across more pronounced when you're president of the United States.
*  And the cameras are on you so intensely.
*  Right. And I think what really stands out for a lot of people, particularly lately, has been his memory.
*  You know, he will confuse people, for instance, mentioning Helmut Kohl, and he means Angela Merkel, different chancelers of Germany.
*  Helmut Kohl, of course, has been dead for a number of years.
*  Same with France.
*  He confused Francois Mitterrand, the late president of France with Emmanuel Macron, the current president of France.
*  In my reporting, even talking with people about private moments with the president, what striking is like administration officials, friends, who haven't seen him in a while or former AIDS, who are catching up with him after a number of months.
*  What they'll say is how surprised they are at how much he is aged.
*  They too notice it when they haven't seen him for a while and it's been striking to them.
*  So it's not just even what the reporters are seeing, but the people who are around them.
*  Peter, I'm curious in your reporting, how you're separating what might be kind of superficial about what, for example, these former AIDS are telling you or what we all see, you know, the president for getting a foreign leader's name mistaken it.
*  How you separate potentially a common variety of someone getting old and having a lapse from what's truly worrisome about this as a journalist.
*  Yeah, I mean, that's a fair question. And what we've tried to do is do a lot of reporting to distinguish between the two right between the superficial does it really matter if he gets the name wrong here or there.
*  And is his judgment affected is his ability to process information and make important decisions affected. And that's that's what really of course matters most in a president, a commander in chief, especially at time when we have so many crises.
*  And so go write a team of us at the time spent weeks talking to dozens of people around Biden. And when we found is basically there's sort of these two Biden's coexisting side by side.
*  There's the one who does forget names in places and may trail off in the middle of the thought. But then there's the Biden that behaves the way you would expect a president to act, you know, to really grill his AIDS on what's going on and make sure he has all the information.
*  And then he's going to wreck them when he thinks that they're wrong to make crisp decisions when they are necessary to make wise decisions in the face of these enormous challenges and crises that a president can face.
*  And so there's one story, for instance, about the president being on a trip to Asia a number of months back and being woken in the middle of the night to find out that a missile had struck Poland, which of course is a NATO ally of America.
*  A real crisis because the fear was that Russia in its war with Ukraine had hit a NATO ally, which would have been a massive escalation.
*  Right, I remember it. Right. And in the middle of the night he's woken up to deal with this crisis. And as his AIDS describe it, and of course, this is AIDS. We're not there. But as they describe it, you know, he does what you want a president to do. He gets in touch with the president of Poland and the NATO Secretary General.
*  And he really leads the world through this crisis. And as they discover, fortunately, it would turn out not to be a Russian missile.
*  Right. And intentional escalation and the crisis was diffused. But that's the two Biden's you're seeing. The one that you don't see as much on TV or in public, who is doing the job that the voters wanted to do.
*  Right. The conclusion you and our colleagues seem to have drawn and correct my firm wrong is that even if Biden's memory and his verbal agility,
*  is it any kind of decline in the moments that matter? The president functions highly. And in those moments of functioning highly, most of them are off camera.
*  Yeah, that's right. Look, in interviewing all these people who have been around him, AIDS, administration officials, allies, congressional officials, even foreign diplomats, nobody has said to me, they don't think he can do the job. Nobody said that they think that the issues that trouble a lot of Americans about his appearance or the, you know, his clear agent.
*  Have effect that his capacity to make the decisions that you would want a president to make. Now what a lot of people do have concern about and clinging some people around him is, you know, where this could lead. If he's able to make these decisions in the way he does now, that's one thing. What will it be like a year from now or if he wins another election five years from now, he would be 86 at the end of a second term. And that's the question. I think a lot of voters are going to ask. Right. So even those around him who are quick.
*  To tell you, there's no problem with President Biden's ability to function in this job period, say, but if you're asking us what will it look like in four years and a second term, there's some pause there.
*  At least among some of them, right. There are a lot of people in the administration who will in a, you know, candid moment, maybe over a glass of wine at night or when they're certainly not on the record, then you would hear from some administration officials anyway, this concern about what things may be like in a year or especially five years. And they understand it's like a lot of Americans do that that a lot can happen between now and then.
*  At the same time, of course, it's a binary choice. The other candidate here is not exactly a younger generation that's Donald Trump, he's 77 and he has his own public memory lapses and confusion over issues and names have weaponized law enforcement to arrest their leading political opponent, leading by a lot, including Obama. I'll tell you what, you take a look at Obama and take a look at some of the things that he's done. This is the same thing. The country is very divided.
*  And we did with Obama, we won an election that everyone said couldn't be one and all kinds of other, you know, things he says that seemed to indicate cognitive issues with age.
*  We have a man who is totally corrupt and the worst president in the history of our country who is cognitively impaired in no condition to lead and is now in charge of dealing with Russia and possible nuclear war.
*  Just think of it. We would be the world war too.
*  Differences, of course, that Trump speaks with such a bombastic energy that it sort of conveys something different and the polls show that while a lot of Americans are also concerned about Trump's age, and he would also be the oldest president in history if he wins and finishes a four year term.
*  Not as many voters are quite as concerned as they are with Biden that the age issue has definitely been more damaging politically for Biden so far than has been for Trump.
*  Right. So fairly or unfairly, and I'm sure to those in Biden world, it's unfair.
*  The reality is that the age issue cuts both ways, but it seems to bruise Biden more.
*  Right. So I think it's fair to say that is the complicated backdrop against which the special council report is released.
*  Exactly. So Robert Herr was the special counsel appointed by Attorney General Merritt Garland to look into why President Biden had kept classified documents from his time as vice president, even going back to his time as Senate.
*  And these documents are found in his office and home in Wilmington, Delaware. That's not where they're supposed to be.
*  Right. And of course, President Trump since he had already been investigated for something similar they had to make sure to look at this in a serious way as well.
*  So Robert Herr was a Republican US attorney appointed by Trump and then picked by Merritt Garland to handle this very delicate case because that way, you know, nobody could say that if he found no issue that he was a president,
*  in fact, he has a pretty nonpartisan reputation and he'd spent a long time like about a year looking into this and he decides that there is not a crime here to charge president Biden with, which is obviously a big relief to the president.
*  But this legal exoneration is unfortunately for Biden a political nightmare.
*  The bombshell in the report is why Robert Herr says he can't charge the president.
*  And one of the reasons he says that the president's memory is so bad that he couldn't establish Biden's intent to willfully retain the documents or why these documents were stored the way that they were.
*  Which is an extraordinary claim. I mean, to some it was inflammatory. How does the special counsel? How does her justify coming to that conclusion that the reason or a big reason he can't charge Biden is because the president's memory is so faulty.
*  Right, exactly. So, her sits down with President Biden for five hours of interviews over two days. And in his report, her takes through these key moments when the president can't seem to remember important moments or at least remember the specifics of when they happen.
*  For instance, he said he couldn't remember reading out loud his notes to the ghostwriter of one of his books, although obviously he did do that and in reading those out, read out classified information.
*  He couldn't remember exactly when he was vice president at one point he says, if it was 2013, when did I stop being vice president? He was trying to recall in 2009 am I still a vice president?
*  So, he couldn't place the dates correctly, at least not initially. And in the according to Robert Hurr, even most explosively, President Biden couldn't remember the year that his son bow died even within several years.
*  And I think that in particular was a powerful thing for Robert Hurr to report. So, in the end, her rights in his report, quote, a jury would not convict him because he seemed like a well-meaning elderly man with memory problems.
*  Right. I think a lot of people who saw that language, Peter, or thought, does this special counsel have it in for Joe Biden? I mean, you described him as nonpartisan, but this is a very official legal document. And the conclusions and the language that he arrives at are pointed and seemingly embarrassing and in the context of a campaign, pretty damaging.
*  And so, the thinking becomes, is there a backstory here we need to understand?
*  Right. Yeah, that's a fair question. And after all, this special counsel was tasked with looking into Ms. Hanley, classified documents, not the president's mental acuity. But, you know, for Robert Hurr, he felt the need to justify his decision, not to bring criminal charges. And so, the examples needed, I suppose, in his mind to be as revealing and telling as they were, in order to be able to identify the right person.
*  And so, the question was, is there anything else that you could say about the question that you were asking as they were in order to explain the conclusion that he made?
*  Right. Because whatever this issue was before this report was released by his age, his memory, all those questions, it was suddenly on steroids. It was suddenly something really hard to not look at and talk about and think about.
*  This is not a reporter writing a story. It's not a columnist or a commentator making gratuitous comments. It's not Republicans chopping up his videos and putting them out in a damaging way.
*  This is an official report and is saying that a conclusion about whether or not to charge President of the United States has been based on his ability to remember things or not remember things of the case maybe.
*  And the line then becomes well, if he's not fit to be a defendant in a trial, as he fit to be President of the United States.
*  And you can imagine how this goes over in the White House, right? This is infuriating to them. Biden land is absolutely livid.
*  The president is absolutely livid. And so, he decides to fight back.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Peter, how does President Biden end up fighting back against this special counsel report that turns out to be so embarrassing for him?
*  Well, on Thursday night, just a few hours after the report comes out and without any real notice to the White House press corps.
*  The President's staff announces that he's going to make a statement.
*  As you know, the special counsel released this fine as a day about their looking to my handling of classified documents.
*  At first, he looks like he's taking a victory left.
*  I was pleased to see he reached the firm conclusion that no charges should be brought against me in this case.
*  He's talking about how he has been exonerated. And that is in fact still the bottom line of the support.
*  And the special counsel acknowledged I cooperated completely.
*  He talks about how this exhaustive investigation included very long interviews in moments of intense pressure.
*  I went forward with a five hour in person, five hour in person energy over two days on October the eighth and ninth of last year, even though Israel had just been attacked by a mass on the seventh and I was very occupied.
*  And he cited the special counsel's own statements praising him for his cooperation, which of course is in great contrast to the former President Trump, who's charged with trying to literally obstruct government officials who are seeking classified documents back.
*  In addition, I know there's some attention paid to some language in the report about my recollection of events.
*  But then the president goes on the attack.
*  There's even reference that I don't remember when my son died.
*  How in the hell dare he race that?
*  And specifically Biden mentions the part of the report that says he couldn't remember when his son died.
*  At this point, you see the anger especially in his face and he's kind of gritting his teeth almost as he's responding.
*  Frank, when I was asked the question I thought to myself, was neither damn business.
*  Right, he's angry, but he's not denying any of hers claims about memory losses.
*  No, he's not denying you the very specific things that her is saying.
*  He's most upset that it suggests that he doesn't remember his son's death.
*  And of course he remembers his son's death that was one of the most string-moans of his life.
*  Robert, her wasn't saying he didn't remember that.
*  Her was saying he didn't remember the date.
*  Right. But for President Biden, it was a step too far.
*  It was an inflammatory thing to say.
*  The last question was to make a decision about whether to move forward with charges in this case.
*  That's their decision to make.
*  That's a council's decision to make.
*  That's his job.
*  And they decided not to move forward.
*  For any extraneous commentary, they don't know what they're talking about.
*  It has no place in this report.
*  The bottom line is a matter is now closed.
*  I'm going to continue what I've always focused on.
*  My job will be in President of the United States of America.
*  Thank you, and I'll take some questions.
*  And then there's a feisty question and answer session with the White House press corps on all these issues.
*  Right.
*  President Biden, something the special council said in his report is that one of the reasons you were not charged is because in his description, you are a well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.
*  I'm well-meaning and I've been known as a man and I know what the hell I'm doing.
*  Most dramatically he has his back and forth with a Fox News reporter Peter Ducey who asks him, can you continue with this country back on his feet?
*  I don't need his recommendation.
*  How bad is your memory and can you continue with President?
*  My memory is so bad I let you speak.
*  Biden pushes it back on him saying, my memory is so bad I let you speak.
*  And I think that was an effective moment for Biden to kind of turn the question back around.
*  Right. And so this is almost a very effective moment of political performance until it's not.
*  Yeah.
*  He's so close.
*  Thank you all very very much.
*  He's walking out the door.
*  He has said what he wants to say, but he hears a question about Gaza.
*  And he decides to turn around and come back to the podium and back to the microphone to answer the question.
*  And he gives them actually important news there.
*  He says the conduct of the response in Gaza in the Gaza Strip has been over the top.
*  That Israel's response in Gaza was over the top.
*  That was much sharper than he has said before.
*  But then he makes a mistake.
*  The President of Mexico, C.C. did not want to open up the gate to allow humanitarian material to get in.
*  I talked to him.
*  He says the President of Mexico when he means the President of Egypt.
*  And it's not that big a deal obviously, but in this moment.
*  Right.
*  In this particular moment when people are focused on his memory and his ability to speak correctly, in the end it distracts from the message he had just delivered about how sharp he was.
*  Right.
*  Once this news conference is over, it did feel pretty clear that something had changed.
*  Right.
*  And that when it comes to this question of his memory, his acuity, this was something of a turning point.
*  And the question becomes how much of a turning point does it matter?
*  Will it go away?
*  And I'm curious.
*  Does this moment change anything about how the Democratic Party treats Biden at this very important moment when he's the presumed nominee, coasting towards becoming the party's candidate for re-election?
*  And does it change how Biden conducts himself as President and as candidate?
*  Yeah.
*  Let's start with the party.
*  I mean, there are Democrats like David Axelrod, who of course was Obama's top adviser.
*  And he knows Biden well from the time he was Vice President, who were saying the ages are real issue and that they need to take it seriously.
*  They have questioned whether it was a great idea to nominate a candidate of this age and a race that's so important from the Democratic point of view to win.
*  But is this a turning point of the conversation?
*  I mean, the thing is, I think prior to this report, the White House had done a pretty good job of tying a tamp down concern in the Democratic Party to the point where they had convinced a lot of the people who may have their doubts about him to recognize he was going to be their candidate anyway.
*  So it was time to try to move on past that issue and not focus on it.
*  And then you have this report come out that puts it front and center again and causes a lot more hand-ringing inside the party about what they're going to do with the candidate who's 81 years old.
*  Yes, but at a stage in the Democratic nomination process where it does feel more or less impossible to do anything about it.
*  Yeah, I mean, the reality is nobody can talk Joe Biden out of running at this point except maybe his wife and she's all on board.
*  So he has spent decades trying to become the president of the United States and then you want to tell him not to run again no way.
*  He feels, I think, very aggrieved at this idea that he shouldn't run for a second term when he feels like he's done a really good job in the first term so far.
*  And he also feels he has uniquely suited to beat Donald Trump because he's the one guy who did beat Donald Trump in 2020.
*  And in fact, other Democrats deferred to him whether they thought it was a good idea or not really nobody challenged him.
*  I mean, Dean Phillips, a congressman from Minnesota got in the race and he got clobbered in the New Hampshire primary where Biden wasn't even on the ballot and people wrote him in.
*  There is no plausible scenario at this point for any candidate other than president Biden unless something happens between now and the election that forces a change.
*  Right.
*  Nor and it seems important to mention this.
*  Is there anything approaching a meaningful public call to even have that conversation at this point?
*  Exactly.
*  And so a lot of you hear from some Democrats, even the ones who are uncomfortable with that, you know, a call to say enough for the discussion about this.
*  We need to figure out how to beat the other guy not so much beating up on our own guy.
*  Right. And so in effect, the baseline strategy is to say, okay, sure, Biden is old, but Trump is crazy.
*  That's the argument they're going to make and wouldn't you rather have a well meaning, but held early guy to paraphrase Robert Herzeport versus a person who in their view and another person who is not a good person.
*  View and another view of a lot of Americans is reckless and dangerous.
*  And then Trump himself decides to say something that will play right into the democratic strategy.
*  Hmm.
*  Just explain that.
*  Very much. South Carolina.
*  We've had our great relationship with South Carolina.
*  Thank you.
*  So he's in South Carolina at a rally on Saturday, just two days after the Herzeport comes out.
*  And he's talking about NATO and how NATO members should be spending more on their military and he's been pushing them to do it.
*  And he recounts the story where he says, anyway, a NATO ally wants asked him, well, sir, if we don't pay and we're attacked by Russia, will you protect us?
*  I said, you didn't pay.
*  You're delinquent.
*  If we don't pay and we're attacked by Russia, will you protect us?
*  He says, no, no, I would not protect you.
*  In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want.
*  You got to pay.
*  You got to pay your bills.
*  Not only will I not protect you, he says he would encourage the Russians to do whatever the hell they want.
*  In other words, he would encourage an enemy to attack America's own treaty allies.
*  Most politicians have said to that, yes, we will protect you under any circumstances.
*  Well, then they're never paying up.
*  Right.
*  And suddenly, the question of Biden's age is no longer the central story of the moment.
*  And it's put in a very different perspective.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  Exactly.
*  It's not just that he changes the subject, which is important and helpful to the Biden camp, is that he helps the Biden people reframe the age question to say, which is more important to you.
*  Somebody who forgets a name or can't summon a date or somebody who would completely undermine the entire international order as we have known it for generations.
*  And from their viewpoint, this helps put the age question in perspective.
*  But I think what's ultimately so fascinating about this moment is the reality that Biden, those around him, the Democratic Party, arguably have made the choice in this election, perhaps more complicated than it ever really needed to be.
*  If you think that Trump is a unique threat and so many Democrats argue that, so many Democratic leaders argue that, then you have the hard, but necessary debate about whether the 81 year old president, Joe Biden, should be the nominee, whether it makes sense, whether it creates the strongest possible chances for victory.
*  And Democrats didn't do that.
*  They didn't.
*  They just pretty much went through the motions to reenominate Biden.
*  So how do you think about that?
*  Yeah, I think that's a very interesting question, an important question.
*  The party didn't really have that conversation in an open way.
*  They deferred to the incumbent president because he wanted to run again.
*  And because they thought at least at one point that his argument that he was the one person who could be Trump would be the safest pair of hands in a way.
*  But the polls show he's not.
*  The polls show that he's running even or even behind for president Trump.
*  And in fact, it's not a guarantee to win in 2024.
*  Right.
*  In other words, the party made a risky bet when their argument is that the risk on the other side is intolerable.
*  And to that point, Peter, how does the president, those around him, the party plan for a 10 month long campaign now,
*  where eyes are trained on the question of Biden, his age, his acuity.
*  And what do we understand to be their strategy for making the most of a pretty tricky situation?
*  Yeah, there's actually a lot of debate intention about this within Biden world.
*  There are those who want to protect him.
*  Make sure that he doesn't have too many opportunities to make mistakes that would embarrass him.
*  And there are those around him.
*  There are people in the White House and the administration, I hear, say, let him lose.
*  Put him out there and he will do fine.
*  Most broadly, though, I think the broad strategy is they're just going to have to gut it out.
*  There's no chance of changing candidates at this point.
*  So just live with it.
*  Make the contrast with former president Trump.
*  Make the argument that you've got two old men, both of whom have their issues about age,
*  but that one of them is a responsible actor and the other's not.
*  And the question is, will they be able to make that case the American public and will the American public buy it?
*  Well, Peter, thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  Great talking to you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Today, after not just a long night and weekend, but after months of work, we can say it's been worth it.
*  On Tuesday, after months of tense bipartisan negotiations, the US Senate passed a long awaited foreign aid package for Ukraine and Israel that now appears doomed in the US House.
*  The $95 billion aid package was originally linked to tougher security measures at the US-Mexico border as congressional Republicans had demanded.
*  But once former president Trump denounced that bill, the Senate proceeded with legislation that funded Israel and Ukraine without border security.
*  Despite overwhelming support for the legislation in the Senate, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said he would refuse to bring the bill up for a vote in his chamber because it lacks border security,
*  despite opposing the version of the bill that contained border security.
*  And I call on Speaker Johnson to rise to the occasion, to do the right thing, bring this bill to the floor.
*  In a speech on Tuesday, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer pleaded with Johnson to change his mind.
*  It is clear that if that bill is brought to the floor, our bill is brought to the floor, it will pass.
*  And...
*  On this vote, the Yez are 214 and the Nas are 213. The resolution is adopted.
*  House Republicans have impeached the Secretary of Homeland Security after trying and failing to do so last week.
*  Republicans have shown no evidence that the Secretary, Alejandro Mallorquez, has committed any constitutional crimes.
*  But instead, faced their impeachment on objections to his policies, which they say have failed to secure the order.
*  There is no chance that Mallorquez will be convicted in the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats.
*  Finally, in the closely watched special election to fill the seat of Republican Representative George Santos of New York,
*  who was expelled over his lies and financial schemes, the Democratic candidate Tom Swasi has defeated his Republican opponent.
*  Because Democrats have flipped the seat, Republicans can now lose only two votes on any partisan bill.
*  Today's episode was produced by Carlos Preato and Michael Simon Johnson.
