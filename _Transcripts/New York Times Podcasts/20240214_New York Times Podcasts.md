# The Biden Problem Democrats Can No Longer Ignore
**New York Times Podcasts:** [February 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrmmbSwoHvY)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Waboro. This is The Daily.
*  For months, Democrats have downplayed questions about President Biden's age and his memory.
*  That just got much harder to do.
*  My colleague, Peter Baker, explains.
*  It's Wednesday, February 14th.
*  Peter, when the special counsel report was released a few days ago and ignited into a
*  national conversation about President Biden's age and memory, all of us here at The Daily
*  thought of you because you've covered Biden for decades now.
*  You've seen him up close as a senator, as vice president, now president.
*  You've watched him age.
*  And in your role as chief White House correspondent, you've been examining what it means for Biden
*  to be the oldest president in American history.
*  So I just want to start there with your own observations.
*  Well, yeah, the reality is that Joe Biden has aged and it's hard not to notice.
*  And I think over the past few years, that aging has been a pronounced process.
*  There's a real change occurring. Not surprising.
*  It's normal for somebody of his age.
*  In many ways, obviously, he's as healthy and vigorous as any 81 year old you can see.
*  He rides bikes, he exercises.
*  But it's hard not to notice when you watch him up close.
*  Well, just explain what you mean when you talk about this aging.
*  Like you said, everyone ages.
*  But let's talk about the specifics of Biden aging here.
*  Well, there's the public presentation, right?
*  What you see when he shows up in the East Room, for instance, or the podium, you see it in his gate.
*  First thing out, right?
*  He's walking to the podium and he kind of shuffles now into rooms.
*  And he has taken a few falls recently.
*  You know, he once fell on his bike and that was recorded by cameras, which was embarrassing to him.
*  So that's the visual element. That's what we see.
*  And then, you know, there's also the verbal element.
*  They had to work hard to show patience and be willing to travel over a thousand miles.
*  You could say even this harder than getting a ticket to the Renaissance tour or or
*  Britain's tour. She's down and it's kind of warm in Brazil right now.
*  You can hear him in his extemporaneous speaking, sometimes trail off mid-sentence.
*  What 40 percent of all products coming into the United States of America on the West Coast go through
*  Los Angeles and and what am I doing here?
*  The Long Beach. Long Beach. Thank you.
*  Or, you know, struggling to find his way back.
*  There is some movement and I don't want to I don't want to.
*  Well, maybe choose my words.
*  There's some movement. There's been a response from.
*  The. There's been a response.
*  Again, that's not unusual for somebody of his age, but it comes across more pronounced
*  when you're president of the United States and the cameras are on you so intensely.
*  Right. And I think what really stands out for a lot of people, particularly lately, has been his memory.
*  You know, he will confuse people, for instance, mentioning Helmut Kohl when he means Angela Merkel,
*  different chancellors of Germany.
*  Helmut Kohl, of course, been dead for a number of years.
*  Same with France. He confused François Mitterrand, the late president of France, with Emmanuel Macron,
*  the current president of France.
*  In my reporting, even talking with people about private moments with the president,
*  what's striking is like administration officials, for instance, who haven't seen him in a while,
*  or former aides who are catching up with him after a number of months.
*  What they'll say is how surprised they are at how much he is aged.
*  They, too, notice it when they haven't seen him for a while.
*  And it's been striking to them.
*  So it's not just even what the reporters are saying, but the people who are around them.
*  Peter, I'm curious in your reporting how you're separating what might be kind of superficial about
*  what, for example, these former aides are telling you or what we all see,
*  you know, the president forgetting a foreign leader's name, mistaking it.
*  How you separate potentially a common variety of someone getting old and having elapsed
*  from what's truly worrisome about this as a journalist.
*  Yeah, I mean, that's a fair question.
*  And what we've tried to do is do a lot of reporting to distinguish between the two, right?
*  Between the superficial, does it really matter if he gets the name wrong here or there?
*  And is his judgment affected?
*  Is his ability to process information and make important decisions affected?
*  And that's what really, of course, matters most in a president and a commander in chief,
*  especially at a time when we have so many crises.
*  And so a few months ago, right, a team of us at the time spent weeks talking to dozens of people
*  around Biden. And what we found is basically there are sort of these two Biden's coexisting
*  side by side. There's the one who does forget names and places and may trail off in the
*  middle of the thought.
*  But then there's the Biden that behaves the way you would expect a president to act, you
*  know, to really grill his aides on what's going on and make sure he has all the information
*  in fact to correct them when he thinks that they're wrong, to make crisp decisions when
*  they are necessary to make wise decisions in the face of these enormous challenges and
*  crises that a president can face.
*  And so there's one story, for instance, about the president being on a trip to to Asia a
*  number of months back and being woken in the middle of the night to find out that a missile
*  had struck Poland, which, of course, is the NATO ally of America.
*  And this is a real crisis because the fear was that Russia in its war with Ukraine had
*  hit a NATO ally, which would have been a massive escalation.
*  Right. I remember it right.
*  And in the middle of the night, he's woken up to deal with this crisis.
*  And as his aides describe it, and of course, this is his aides, we're not there.
*  But as they describe it, you know, he does what you want a president to do.
*  He gets in touch with the president of Poland and the NATO secretary general, and he really
*  leads the world through this crisis.
*  And as they discover, fortunately, it turned out not to be a Russian missile.
*  It was an intentional escalation.
*  And then the crisis was diffused.
*  But that's the two Bidens you're seeing, the one that you don't see as much on TV or in
*  public who is doing the job that the voters want him to do.
*  Right. The conclusion you and our colleagues seem to have drawn and correct my
*  if I'm wrong, is that even if Biden's memory and his verbal agility is in any kind
*  of decline in the moments that matter, the president functions highly.
*  And in those moments of functioning highly, most of them are off camera.
*  Yeah, that's right. Look, in interviewing all these people who have been around him,
*  aides, administration officials, allies, congressional officials, even foreign diplomats.
*  Nobody has said to me they don't think he can do the job.
*  Nobody said they think that the issues that trouble a lot of Americans about his appearance
*  or his clear aging have affected his capacity to make the decisions that you would
*  want a president to make. Now, what a lot of people do have concern about, including some
*  people around him, is where this could lead.
*  If he's able to make these decisions in the way he does now, that's one thing.
*  What will it be like a year from now?
*  Or if he wins another election five years from now, he would be 86 at the end of a second
*  term. And that's that's the question I think a lot of voters are going to ask.
*  Right. So even those around him who are quick to tell you there's no problem with
*  President Biden's ability to function of his job, period, say.
*  But if you're asking us what will it look like in four years and a second term, there's
*  some pause there.
*  At least among some of them, right.
*  There are a lot of people in the administration who will in a candid moment, maybe over a
*  glass of wine at night or when they're certainly not on the record, then you would hear from
*  some administration officials anyway, this concern about what things may be like in a
*  year or especially five years.
*  And they understand, just like a lot of Americans do, that a lot can happen between now
*  and then. But at the same time, of course, it's a binary choice.
*  The other candidate here is not exactly a younger generation.
*  That's Donald Trump. He's 77.
*  And he has his own public memory lapses and confusion over issues and names.
*  Have weaponized law enforcement to arrest their leading political opponent, leading by a
*  lot, including Obama.
*  I'll tell you what, you take a look at Obama and take a look at some of the things that
*  he's done. This is the same thing.
*  The country is very divided.
*  And we did with Obama.
*  We won an election that everyone said couldn't be won.
*  And all kinds of other, you know, things he says that seem to indicate cognitive issues
*  with age. We have a man who is totally corrupt and the worst president in the history of
*  our country, who is cognitively impaired, in no condition to lead and is now in charge
*  of dealing with Russia and possible nuclear war.
*  Just think of it. We would be in World War Two.
*  The difference is, of course, that Trump speaks with such bombastic energy that it sort of
*  conveys something different.
*  And the polls show that while a lot of Americans are also concerned about Trump's age, and
*  he also would be the oldest president in history if he wins and finishes a four year term,
*  not as many voters are quite as concerned as they are with Biden, that the age issue
*  has definitely been more damaging politically for Biden so far than it has been for Trump.
*  Right. So fairly or unfairly, and I'm sure to those in Biden world, it's unfair.
*  The reality is that the age issue cuts both ways, but it seems to bruise Biden more.
*  Right. So I think it's fair to say that is the complicated backdrop against which the
*  special counsel report is released.
*  Exactly. So Robert Herr was the special counsel appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland
*  to look into why President Biden had kept classified documents from his time as vice
*  president, even going back to his time as Senate.
*  And these documents were found in his office and home in Wilmington, Delaware.
*  That's not where they're supposed to be.
*  Right. And of course, President Trump, since he had already been investigated for something
*  similar, they had to make sure to look at this in a serious way as well.
*  So Robert Herr was a Republican U.S.
*  attorney appointed by Trump and then picked by Merrick Garland to handle this very delicate
*  case, because that way nobody could say that if he found no issue that he was a partisan
*  Democrat. In fact, he has a pretty nonpartisan reputation and he'd spent a long time, like
*  about a year looking into this.
*  And he decides that there is not a crime here to charge President Biden with, which is
*  obviously a big relief to the president.
*  But this legal exoneration is unfortunately for Biden a political nightmare.
*  The bombshell in the report is why Robert Herr says he can't charge the president.
*  And one of the reasons, he says, is the president's memory is so bad that he couldn't
*  establish Biden's intent to willfully retain the documents or why these documents
*  were stored the way that they were.
*  Which is an extraordinary claim.
*  I mean, to some it was inflammatory.
*  How does the special counsel, how does her justify coming to that conclusion that
*  the reason or a big reason he can't charge Biden is because the president's memory
*  is so faulty?
*  Right, exactly. So Herr sits down with President Biden for five hours of interviews over
*  two days. And in his report, Herr takes through these key moments when the president
*  can't seem to remember important moments or at least remember the specifics of when
*  they happened. For instance, he said he couldn't remember reading out loud his notes
*  to the ghostwriter of one of his books, although obviously he did do that.
*  And in reading those out, read out classified information.
*  He couldn't remember exactly when he was vice president.
*  At one point, he says, if it was 2013, when did I stop being vice president?
*  He was trying to recall in 2009, am I still vice president?
*  So he couldn't place the dates correctly, at least not initially.
*  And according to Robert Herr, even most explosively, President Biden couldn't remember
*  the year that his son, Bo, died, even within several years.
*  And I think that in particular was a powerful thing for Robert Herr to report.
*  So in the end, Herr writes in his report, quote, a jury would not convict him because
*  he seemed like a well-meaning elderly man with memory problems.
*  Right. I think a lot of people who saw that language, Peter, thought, does this special
*  counsel have it in for Joe Biden?
*  I mean, you described him as nonpartisan, but this is a very official legal document.
*  And the conclusions and the language that he arrives at are pointed and seemingly
*  embarrassing and in the context of a campaign, pretty damaging.
*  And so the thinking becomes, is there a backstory here we need to understand?
*  Right. Yeah, that's a fair question.
*  And after all, the special counsel was tasked with looking into mishandling classified
*  documents, not the president's mental acuity.
*  But for Robert Herr, he felt the need to justify his decision not to bring criminal charges.
*  And so the examples needed, I suppose, in his mind to be as revealing and telling as
*  they were in order to explain the conclusion that he made.
*  Right. Because whatever this issue was before this report was released, Biden, his age,
*  his memory, all those questions, it was suddenly on steroids.
*  It was suddenly something really hard to not look at and talk about and think about.
*  Absolutely. This is not a poll.
*  This is not a reporter writing a story.
*  It's not a columnist or a commentator making gratuitous comments.
*  It's not Republicans chopping up his videos and putting them out in a damaging way.
*  This is an official report and is saying that a conclusion about whether or not to charge
*  President of the United States has been based on his ability to remember things or not
*  remember things that the case may be.
*  And the line then becomes, well, if he's not fit to be a defendant in a trial, is he fit
*  to be President of the United States?
*  And you can imagine how this goes over in the White House.
*  Right. This is infuriating to them.
*  Bidenland is absolutely livid.
*  The president is absolutely livid.
*  And so he decides to fight back.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Peter, how does President Biden end up fighting back against this special counsel
*  report that turns out to be so embarrassing for him?
*  Well, on Thursday night, just a few hours after the report comes out and without any
*  real notice to the White House press corps, the president's staff announces that he's
*  going to make a statement.
*  As you know, the special counsel released his findings today about their look into my
*  handling of classified documents.
*  And at first, he looks like he's taking a victory lap.
*  I was pleased to see he reached a firm conclusion that no charges should be brought
*  against me in this case.
*  He's talking about how he has been exonerated, and that is, in fact, still the bottom line
*  of this report. The special counsel acknowledged I cooperated completely.
*  He talks about how this exhaustive investigation included very long interviews in moments
*  of intense pressure.
*  I went forward with a five hour in-person, five hour in-person interview over two days
*  on October the 8th and 9th of last year, even though Israel had just been attacked by
*  Hamas on the 7th and I was very occupied.
*  And he cited the special counsel's own statements praising him for his cooperation,
*  which, of course, is in great contrast to former President Trump, right, who's charged
*  with trying to literally obstruct government officials who are seeking classified
*  documents back.
*  In addition, I know there's some attention paid to some language in the report about
*  my recollection of events.
*  But then the president goes on the attack.
*  There's even reference that I don't remember when my son died.
*  How the hell dare he raise that?
*  And specifically, Biden mentions part of the report that says he couldn't remember
*  when his son died.
*  At this point, you see the anger, especially in his face, and he's kind of gritting his
*  teeth almost as he's responding.
*  Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself, wasn't any of their damn
*  business.
*  Right. He's angry, but he's not denying any of her's claims about memory lapses.
*  No, he's not denying any of the very specific things that her is saying.
*  He's most upset that it suggests that he doesn't remember his son's death.
*  And of course, he remembers his son's death.
*  That was one of the most stirring moments of his life.
*  Robert Her wasn't saying he didn't remember that.
*  Robert Her was saying he didn't remember the date.
*  Right.
*  But for President Biden, it was a step too far.
*  It was an inflammatory thing to say.
*  Their task was to make a decision about whether to move forward with charges in this case.
*  That's their decision to make.
*  That's the council's decision to make.
*  That's his job.
*  And they decided not to move forward for any extraneous commentary.
*  They don't know what they're talking about.
*  It has no place in this report.
*  The bottom line is a matter is now closed.
*  I'm going to continue what I've always focused on my job of being president of the United
*  States of America.
*  Thank you. And I'll take some questions.
*  And then there's a feisty question and answer session with the White House Press Corps on
*  all these issues.
*  Right.
*  President Biden, something the special counsel said in his report is that one of the reasons
*  you were not charged is because in his description, you are a well-meaning elderly man
*  with a poor memory.
*  I'm well-meaning and I'm an elderly man and I know what the hell I'm doing.
*  I've been president.
*  Most dramatically, he has his back and forth with a Fox News reporter, Peter Ducey, who
*  asks him, can you continue?
*  This country back on its feet.
*  I don't need his recommendation.
*  How bad is your memory and can you continue as president?
*  My memory is so bad, I let you speak.
*  Biden pushes it back on him, saying, my memory is so bad, I let you speak.
*  And I think that was an effective moment for Biden to kind of turn the question back
*  around. Right.
*  And so this is almost a very effective moment of political performance until it's not.
*  Yeah, he's so close.
*  Thank you all very, very much.
*  He's walking out the door.
*  He has said what he wants to say, but he hears a question about Gaza.
*  And he decides to turn around and come back to the podium and back to the microphone
*  to answer the question.
*  And he gives some actually important news there.
*  He says the conduct.
*  The response.
*  Of the response.
*  In Gaza, in the Gaza Strip.
*  Has been.
*  Over the top.
*  The Israel's response in Gaza was over the top.
*  That was much sharper than he has said before.
*  But then he makes a mistake.
*  The president of Mexico, Sisi, did not want to open up the gate to allow humanitarian
*  material to get in.
*  I talked to him.
*  Mexico, when he means the president of Egypt and is not that big a deal, obviously,
*  but in this moment, right in this particular moment when people are focused on his
*  memory and his ability to to speak correctly in the end, it distracts from the message
*  he had just delivered about how sharp he was.
*  Right. Once this news conference is over, it did feel pretty clear that something had
*  changed. Right. And that when it comes to this question of his memory, his acuity,
*  this was something of a turning point.
*  And the question becomes how much of a turning point does it matter?
*  Will it go away?
*  And I'm curious, does this moment change anything about how the Democratic Party
*  treats Biden at this very important moment when he's the presumed nominee coasting
*  towards becoming the party's candidate for reelection?
*  And does it change how Biden conducts himself as president and as candidate?
*  Yeah, let's start with the party.
*  I mean, there are Democrats like David Axelrod, who, of course, was Obama's top advisor
*  and who knows Biden well from the time he was vice president, who are saying that age
*  is a real issue and that they need to take it seriously.
*  They have questioned whether it was a great idea to nominate a candidate of this age in
*  a race that's so important from the Democratic point of view to win.
*  But is this a turning point in the conversation?
*  I mean, the thing is, I think prior to this report, the White House has done a pretty
*  good job of trying to tamp down concern in the Democratic Party to the point where they
*  had convinced a lot of people who may have their doubts about him to recognize he was
*  going to be their candidate anyway.
*  So it was time to try to move on past that issue and not focus on it.
*  And then you have this report come out that puts it front and center again and causes
*  a lot more hand wringing inside the party about what they're going to do with a
*  candidate who's 81 years old.
*  Yes, but at a stage in the Democratic nomination process where it does feel more or
*  less impossible to do anything about it.
*  Yeah, I mean, the reality is nobody can talk to a Biden out of running at this point,
*  except maybe his wife, and she's all on board.
*  So he has spent decades trying to become the president of the United States.
*  And then you want to tell him not to run again?
*  No way. You know, he feels, I think, very aggrieved at this idea that he shouldn't
*  run for a second term when he feels like he's done a really good job in the first
*  term so far. And he also feels he is uniquely suited to beat Donald Trump because
*  he's the one guy who did beat Donald Trump in 2020.
*  Right. And in fact, other Democrats deferred to him whether they thought it was a good
*  idea or not. Really, nobody challenged him.
*  I mean, Dean Phillips, a congressman from Minnesota, got in the race and he got
*  clobbered in the New Hampshire primary where Biden wasn't even on the ballot and
*  people wrote him in. So there is no plausible scenario at this point for any
*  candidate other than President Biden unless something happens between now and
*  the election that forces a change.
*  Right. Nor, and it seems important to mention this, is there anything
*  approaching a meaningful public call to even have that conversation at this point?
*  Exactly. They recognize that that conversation is too late to have at this
*  point. And so a lot you hear from some Democrats, even the ones who are
*  uncomfortable with that, you know, a call to say enough of the discussion about
*  this. We need to figure out how to how to beat the other guy, not so much beating
*  up on our own guy. Right.
*  And so in effect, the baseline strategy is to say, OK, sure, Biden is old, but
*  Trump is crazy. That's the argument they're going to make.
*  And wouldn't you rather have a well-meaning but elderly guy to paraphrase
*  Robert Hurt's report versus a person who in their view and in the view of a lot of
*  Americans is reckless and dangerous?
*  And then Trump himself decides to say something that will play right into the
*  Democratic strategy.
*  Just explain that.
*  Well, thank you very much. South Carolina.
*  We've had a great relationship with South Carolina.
*  So he's in South Carolina at a rally on Saturday, just two days after the Hurt
*  report comes out. And he's talking about NATO and how NATO members should be
*  spending more on their military. And he's been pushing them to do it.
*  And he recounts this story where he says, anyway, a NATO ally once asked him,
*  Well, sir, if we don't pay and we're attacked by Russia, will you protect us?
*  I said, you didn't pay.
*  You're delinquent.
*  If we don't pay and we're attacked by Russia, will you protect us?
*  And he says, no, no, I would not protect you.
*  In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want.
*  You got to pay. You got to pay your bills.
*  Not only would I not protect you, he says, he would encourage the Russians to do
*  whatever the hell they want.
*  In other words, he would encourage an enemy to attack America's own treaty
*  allies.
*  Most politicians have said to that, yes, we will protect you under any circumstance.
*  Well, then they're never paying up.
*  Right. And suddenly the question of Biden's age is no longer the central story of
*  the moment.
*  And it's put in a very different perspective.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  Yes. Right. Exactly.
*  It's not just that he changes the subject, which is important and helpful to the
*  Biden camp is that he helps the Biden people reframe the age question to say,
*  which is more important to you?
*  Somebody who, you know, forgets a name or can't summon a date or somebody who
*  would completely undermine the entire international order as we have known it
*  for generations.
*  And from their viewpoint, this helps put the age question in perspective.
*  But I think what's ultimately so fascinating about this moment is the reality
*  that Biden, those around him, the Democratic Party arguably have made the
*  choice in this election perhaps more complicated than it ever really needed to
*  be.
*  If you think that Trump is a unique threat, and so many Democrats argue that,
*  so many Democratic leaders argue that, then you have the hard but necessary
*  debate about whether the 81 year old president, Joe Biden, should be the
*  nominee, whether it makes sense, whether it creates the strongest possible
*  chances for victory.
*  And Democrats didn't do that.
*  They didn't.
*  They just pretty much went through the motions to renominate Biden.
*  So how do you think about that?
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that's a very interesting question and an important
*  question.
*  The party didn't really have that conversation in an open way.
*  They deferred to the incumbent president because he wanted to run again.
*  And because they thought at least at one point that his argument that he was the
*  one person who could beat Trump would be the safest pair of hands in a way.
*  But the polls show he's not.
*  The polls show that he's running even or even behind former president Trump.
*  And he in fact is not a guarantee to win in 2024.
*  Right.
*  In other words, the party made a risky bet when their argument is that the
*  risk on the other side is intolerable.
*  And to that point, Peter, how does the president, those around him, the party
*  plan for a 10 month long campaign now where eyes are trained on the question of
*  Biden, his age, his acuity, and what do we understand to be their strategy for
*  making the most of a pretty tricky situation?
*  Yeah, there's actually a lot of debate and tension about this within Biden
*  world. There are those who want to protect him, make sure that he doesn't
*  have too many opportunities to make mistakes that would embarrass him.
*  And there are those around him.
*  There are people in the White House and the administration I hear say, let him
*  lose, put him out there and he will do fine.
*  Most broadly, though, I think the broad strategy is they're just going to have
*  to gut it out.
*  There's no chance of changing candidates at this point.
*  So just live with it.
*  Make the contrast with former president Trump.
*  Make the argument that you've got two old men, both of whom have their issues
*  about age, but that one of them is a responsible actor and the other is not.
*  And the question is, will they be able to make that case to the American public and
*  will the American public buy it?
*  Well, Peter, thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  Great talking to you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Today, after not just a long night and weekend, but after months of work, we can
*  say it's been worth it.
*  On Tuesday, after months of tense bipartisan negotiations, the U.S.
*  Senate passed a long awaited foreign aid package for Ukraine and Israel that now
*  appears doomed in the U.S.
*  House. The 95 billion dollar aid package was originally linked to tougher security
*  measures at the U.S.-Mexico border, as congressional Republicans had demanded.
*  But once former President Trump denounced that bill, the Senate proceeded with
*  legislation that funded Israel and Ukraine without border security.
*  Despite overwhelming support for the legislation in the Senate, Republican House
*  Speaker Mike Johnson said he would refuse to bring the bill up for a vote in his
*  chamber because it lacks border security, despite opposing the version of the bill
*  that contained border security.
*  And I call on Speaker Johnson to rise to the occasion to do the right thing.
*  Bring this bill to the floor.
*  In a speech on Tuesday, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer pleaded with
*  Johnson to change his mind.
*  It is clear that if that bill is brought to the floor, our bill is brought to the
*  floor, it will pass.
*  And on this vote, the Yeas are 214 and the Nasir 213.
*  The resolution is adopted.
*  House Republicans have impeached the secretary of Homeland Security after trying and
*  failing to do so last week.
*  Republicans have shown no evidence that the secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, has
*  committed any constitutional crimes, but instead based their impeachment on
*  objections to his policies, which they say have failed to secure the border.
*  There is no chance that Mayorkas will be convicted in the Senate, which is
*  controlled by Democrats.
*  Finally, in the closely watched special election to fill the seat of Republican
*  Representative George Santos of New York, who was expelled over his lies and
*  financial schemes, the Democratic candidate, Tom Swasey, has defeated his
*  Republican opponent.
*  Because Democrats have flipped the seat, the Senate has been forced to change
*  Republicans can now lose only two votes on any partisan bill.
*  Today's episode was produced by Carlos Prieto and Michael Simon Johnson.
*  It was edited by Rachel Quester with help from Paige Cowitt, contains original
*  music by Chelsea Daniel and was engineered by Chris Wood.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Lansferk of Wonderland.
*  That's it for the Daily.
*  I'm Michael Boboro.
*  See you tomorrow.
