# The Criminal Conviction of Hunter Biden
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIZubnNjXX0)
*  Welcome back. We're getting breaking news into our newsroom this morning. The jury
*  in Delaware has reached a verdict in the federal trial for President Joe Biden's son, Hunter
*  Biden.
*  On count one, the verdict is guilty. On count two, the verdict is guilty. And on count three,
*  the verdict is guilty.
*  It is the first time in history that the child of a sitting president has been convicted
*  of federal charges.
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. This is The Daily. Today, why a jury found
*  Hunter Biden guilty on federal gun charges, what it will mean for his father, and what
*  it could do to the presidential race.
*  White House reporter Katie Rogers is our guest.
*  It's Wednesday, June 12th.
*  Katie, I think we have to start by just recognizing the extraordinary and really improbable situation
*  that we're in as of today, which is that over the past two weeks, the former president
*  of the United States was found guilty of a crime and the son of the current president
*  of the United States was found guilty of a crime, all during a presidential race between
*  those two presidents. It's just kind of staggering.
*  It's remarkable. I was in a hotel lobby next door to the courthouse yesterday after the
*  jury went to deliberate and happened to glance over at CNN and saw former President Trump
*  walking to attend a probation appointment. And just the starkness of that really hit
*  home where we're in this moment where the former president has a probation officer and
*  the president's son is on the precipice of being convicted of three felony gun charges.
*  Right. And there was never any doubt that Trump's case was going to go to trial because
*  he made very clear he was never going to accept a plea deal. But I think for a lot of us,
*  the Hunter Biden case has been a more confusing legal saga. The last time we talked about
*  it on this show, Hunter Biden was very deep in negotiations with the federal government
*  to try to reach a plea deal that would avoid a trial. And then those negotiations collapse.
*  So catch us up, Katie, on what happened next and how it is we got to this guilty set of
*  verdicts.
*  Right. And it's been a real saga. You know, as a reminder, this stems back to the administration's
*  decision of President Donald Trump. At the time, the president and other Republicans
*  were itching to find ways to undercut the candidacy of Joe Biden. And one way to do
*  that is to look into the business dealings and life of his troubled son, Hunter Biden.
*  So before Donald Trump leaves office, a federal prosecutor named David Weiss has been appointed
*  to look into Hunter Biden in a wide investigation that is centered around Hunter Biden's finances.
*  So flash forward to almost a year ago exactly. Hunter Biden and his legal team have reached
*  a deal with Weiss on tax charges and also this gun charge that would avoid jail time
*  and basically avoid the outcome we just saw today. But when that plea deal gets in front
*  of a judge, it becomes clear that both sides are not in agreement about what this deal
*  means, particularly around the issue of whether or not Hunter Biden should face future charges.
*  The judge sends them back to negotiate, but Hunter Biden's team opts not to do that. They
*  decide to roll the dice, essentially challenges Weiss to take this thing to trial.
*  Weiss takes them up on it, brings the charges, and that led to the trial that we saw play
*  out in Delaware last week.
*  And that trial ends up being pretty narrowly focused on gun charges. Just remind us what
*  exactly those charges are.
*  So basically what got Hunter Biden in trouble is that during October 2018, he goes to a
*  gun store in Wilmington, Delaware, looking to buy a revolver. And he filled out a form
*  that said at that current time, he was not an unlawful user of drugs and was not addicted
*  to drugs. And that is one of the disqualifiers that gun sellers use to disqualify people
*  from purchasing a firearm. So basically, prosecutors are saying that at that time, Hunter Biden
*  lied to the gun dealer on that form, lied on the form itself, and illegally possessed
*  a handgun.
*  Got it. They're saying he was, in fact, a drug user at that time.
*  Exactly.
*  Okay, so take us into the trial itself. How do federal prosecutors go about making their
*  case that Hunter Biden lied when he signed that form?
*  Right. So essentially, prosecutors have to prove that Hunter Biden was addicted and an
*  unlawful user of drugs during this period in October where he possessed a handgun. But
*  throughout the trial, which was interesting, and the judge agreed that this was the case,
*  they repeatedly said, we do not have to prove that he was using on the day he purchased
*  the gun or even during the time he had the gun. So in that sense, prosecutors have a
*  really wide window of opportunity to essentially prove that Hunter Biden was a drug addict
*  around this time. So prosecutors have a lot to work with. They have documents, including
*  text messages, bank receipts, ATM withdrawals to present to the jury. But they also have
*  a 2021 memoir written by Hunter Biden that extensively detailed his drug addiction, the
*  depths of it, and it certainly involves a time during which he purchased this gun.
*  He doesn't talk about it in the book, but there are passages in it in which he recounts
*  buying drugs in Wilmington, the addiction he fell into with other family members and
*  snippets of that memoir, which were read in Hunter Biden's voice, were piped in by
*  prosecutors into that courtroom.
*  Wow. So the prosecution starts with a pretty serious mountain of problematic evidence it
*  would sound like for Hunter Biden, including his own words documenting drug use during
*  the period that's at the center of this trial.
*  Right. And on top of all this, on top of all of that evidence, they have witnesses who
*  were very close to Hunter, who detailed his drug use and the toll it took on them at some
*  points, including his ex-wife Kathleen Buell, who was married to him for 24 years and recounted
*  on the stand periods in which she struggled to get him into rehab, during which their
*  marriage essentially fell apart because he was so deep into drug use and also infidelity.
*  And then probably most powerfully, they called Hallie Biden, who is the widow of Hunter
*  Biden's older brother, Beau Biden.
*  Beau died in 2015.
*  And after that, Hunter Biden and Hallie Biden fall into a romantic relationship during which
*  she testified that she fell into crack cocaine use with him.
*  Huh. So Hallie testifies that not only was she aware of Hunter Biden's drug use,
*  but she actually descends into drug addiction with him.
*  Exactly. So what really came through during Hallie Biden's testimony was the hell she
*  sort of described that she was in with Hunter Biden as they fell into drug addiction.
*  She had said they were buying ping pong sized balls of crack cocaine and using them together.
*  And Hunter would disappear for days at a time, telling her that he was, you know,
*  sleeping on a car and smoking crack.
*  And eventually, you know, she begins trying to clean out his car of drug paraphernalia.
*  She stumbles upon this handgun that is in a lock box in Hunter Biden's car.
*  And as she testified and as prosecutors displayed in court, Hallie Biden was texting
*  Hunter Biden at that time saying, I panicked.
*  I just threw it away.
*  He's admonishing her for doing that.
*  And it just really recounts this high drama, very messy period of time between two people
*  who are in the throes of addiction.
*  And it is all around the time that prosecutors are most focused on.
*  Katie, as all of this testimony is being given and these really pretty embarrassing and painful
*  details are being aired, what is the mood like in that courtroom?
*  So the mood in the courtroom was somber and serious as most trials are.
*  But it was also surreal because for most days of this week long trial,
*  Jill Biden, the First Lady, was in the front row sitting directly behind Hunter Biden.
*  So the First Lady of the United States keeps her eyes on Hunter, on the prosecutors,
*  on the defense team.
*  Most of the trials she left for one day to go to France and she left the president's
*  side in France to come back to this trial.
*  That is the starkest illustration to me of the Biden family's priorities.
*  At one point yesterday in the courtroom, I counted at least eight members of the Biden family.
*  Hunter's uncle, Jimmy Biden, was sitting in the front row as was his sister, Ashley Biden,
*  his aunt, Valerie Biden-Owens, who raised him in the first years of his life after his mother died
*  was in the front row.
*  It had become sort of a family affair.
*  Sitting in that courtroom watching Hunter Biden on trial was a stark reminder that while some of the
*  details of Hunter Biden's addiction have been startlingly public at times, the pain faced by
*  the people closest to him has largely been private.
*  And seeing people like Hallie Biden take the stand and detail drug use and recount this hell
*  she had gone through, seeing Kathleen Buell take the stand and talk about the times she tried to
*  get him sober and couldn't do it, was a real reminder that this large, very public-facing family
*  had privately for years been trying to outrun this, trying to move on from it.
*  It really did feel like this first family's worst moments of private pain
*  were now on display for public consumption.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Katie, with all of that sorted testimony we heard from people like Hunter Biden's ex-wife and
*  ex-girlfriend, it feels like the prosecution went a pretty long way towards its goal of portraying
*  Hunter Biden as somebody addicted to drugs.
*  So what was the defense's strategy once it was their turn in this trial?
*  So the defense is trying to prove that during the time Hunter Biden bought that gun in October 2018,
*  he was not addicted to drugs, but in fact was working hard at maintaining his sobriety.
*  And how do they try to prove that?
*  They make the case that there is no proof that prosecutors can find that shows that he was
*  actively using when he filled out that form or during the 11 days he had that gun.
*  And his attorney, Abbie Lowell, who is a long-time criminal defense attorney in Washington,
*  he's a very well-known Washington scandal lawyer, is doing all he can to inject doubt into this very,
*  as prosecutors present it, open and shut case of Hunter Biden's addiction.
*  So for instance, Lowell tries to poke holes in the prosecution's argument that Hunter Biden would
*  frequent a particular 7-Eleven in Delaware to buy drugs by saying there's no absolute proof through
*  text messages, through location data, or otherwise that Hunter was actually in that 7-Eleven buying
*  drugs at one point. Lowell says, you don't know if he's just there to buy a cup of coffee.
*  And that is the work of a defense attorney to say, unless there is hard evidence showing him
*  with a dealer, it could have been for any other reason than to buy drugs. And Hunter Biden
*  could have been or believed himself to be sober.
*  I'm curious who the defense called to the witness stand in their effort to try to muddy this picture
*  of Hunter Biden as someone addicted to drugs in this period.
*  So the defense actually most notably called Hunter Biden's eldest daughter, Naomi Biden,
*  to the stand. And they try to use Naomi as a witness who understands that her father was,
*  by her own words, hopeful and the best she'd seen him in a long time during this period of time.
*  But upon cross-examination, prosecutors pull out text messages between Naomi Biden and her father
*  that show a different story. During the time Hunter Biden had this gun,
*  Naomi Biden is trying to meet up with him in New York City and is unable to reach him.
*  And at one point she tells her father she's really sad. She can't handle this. She just misses him
*  and wants to hang out with him. And prosecutors use those communications to establish that,
*  in fact, this was actually not great. His own daughter could not reach him when they were in
*  the same city. So the defense is theoretically best witness to this idea that he was not a drug
*  addict at this time, that he might have even been sober or on his way to being sober, ends up being
*  someone who essentially confirms the prosecution's claims that Hunter Biden is still not okay during
*  this period. Right. So by the time Naomi Biden leaves the stand, walks across the room, and wraps
*  her dad in a hug for about a minute, it becomes clear that this testimony and this cross-examination
*  especially did not go the way Hunter Biden and his team hoped it would have. And of course,
*  we know that this defense strategy didn't work because we now know the guilty verdict.
*  It seems clear that this jury ultimately looks at all this evidence and says that while perhaps they
*  didn't have a time stamped photograph of Hunter Biden, you know, using drugs or being high on drugs
*  the day that he bought this gun, it very much seems from the testimony that the jury believed
*  the prosecution's portrayal of him as someone very much in the throes of drug addiction
*  at the time that he bought that gun. Right. And in the end, jurors took only three hours
*  to return a guilty verdict. Right. So let's turn to the reaction to this verdict, starting with
*  Hunter Biden's father, President Joe Biden. Right. So minutes after the verdict is announced and the
*  First Lady walks out of the courthouse holding Hunter Biden's hand, the president releases a
*  statement reiterating his support for his son, how proud he is of what he called seeing someone you
*  love come out of the other side of an addiction like this. But also he says he is going to accept
*  the outcome of the trial. Last week he was asked if he would pardon Hunter Biden and President Biden
*  said no. So to me, that's drawing a clear line of being a supportive father who backs his son,
*  no matter what, and a president who is not going to overreach and pardon someone who was just
*  convicted in a court of law. Right. And that simultaneously seemed to be President Biden
*  drawing a contrast with former President Trump. Right. So in an election that has been all about
*  drawing a character contrast with Donald Trump, the statement itself strikes a contrast with
*  Donald Trump, who has railed against the outcome of his own trial has essentially lashed out at
*  every aspect of this legal process. President Biden, by contrast, has quietly accepted the outcome
*  and continued to say that he will keep embracing his son.
*  Since you raised it, the question of this conviction and the election, I think, is going to be on many
*  people's minds. How does the conviction of the incumbent president's son on gun charges
*  potentially impact the course of this election? Well, at the very least, a conviction of the
*  president's son shows that there were consequences in a legal trial that had some serious weight to
*  them. All along, Republicans have alleged that the Biden-led Justice Department was going to
*  let the president's son off easy. So the fact that Hunter Biden was convicted takes some of the
*  steam out of the Republican argument that he would get some sort of sweetheart deal or be treated more
*  favorably than Donald Trump would have been during his own hush money trial. That said, Republicans
*  will use this and Donald Trump will use this to bolster this idea that the Bidens are a crime
*  family, that corruption runs through the family. And in fact, Hunter Biden is going to stand trial
*  later this summer on tax evasion charges. And Republicans are certainly hoping to, in the heat
*  of a campaign season, attack the Bidens again on the grounds that the Bidens can't be trusted,
*  essentially. I would expect to hear more of that in a drumbeat as this campaign goes on.
*  Soterios Johnson Katie, I'm curious, in a country that's ravaged by a drug epidemic,
*  is it possible that this conviction and watching Joe Biden reach out to his son and his family
*  go through what it's gone through might not just be something that doesn't hurt Biden,
*  and this admittedly gets kind of complicated and cynical when it comes to politics, but
*  potentially makes Biden more relatable to some voters and in some sense is a political virtue.
*  I think there's a lot of truth to that. And Americans have showed in polls that what they
*  see of Joe Biden is a father supporting his son. And that's not a political calculation on Joe
*  Biden's part. I think if you know anything about the president and his relationship with his
*  kids, it was forged out of great tragedy at the beginning of President Biden's career.
*  And they're extremely close because of that. And they're incredibly loyal to each other because
*  of that. And you just see that play out through the presidency. You're seeing it play out today.
*  The president rearranged his schedule really quickly after the verdict to go fly home to
*  Wilmington to see his son met Hunter Biden on the tarmac and gave him a hug. So there is that
*  cynical part of you that thinks this is a play for sympathy or a play for Americans to see
*  this family in a different way. But also several of those jurors had family members who
*  suffer from addiction. Most Americans know somebody or are related to someone who suffers
*  from this. It's an incredibly universal problem that Americans deal with. And for the president
*  of the United States to be dealing with the fallout of that is relatable.
*  Katie, I think it makes sense to end this conversation where we began, which is grappling
*  with the fact of these two criminal convictions, not just of Hunter Biden, but of Hunter Biden and
*  Donald Trump. When Hunter Biden was convicted, it struck me at least that if we're being really
*  honest with ourselves, both Donald Trump and Hunter Biden would probably never have been put
*  on trial for these particular charges, a gun charge in the case of Hunter Biden, a hush money
*  payment in the case of Donald Trump, had they not been president or been the president's son, right?
*  That just feels like an objective reality. Trump came into the crosshairs of a Democratic
*  District attorney. Hunter Biden came into the crosshairs of a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney.
*  And so what does all of this say about the way that our legal system is now interacting
*  with our political system? Well, essentially, we've entered an era where politicians are trying to
*  use the legal system to their benefit and where the courts are going to feel more pressure to
*  carry out their wishes. And, you know, to be clear, that doesn't mean all of these cases are
*  without merit or are going to be without merit, but they're now going to be carried out in this
*  environment where politics at the very least will be the backdrop or at the most will be a major
*  factor. So to me, it's looking a bit like it's the price of admission to presidential politics.
*  And as we're seeing with future cases against Hunter Biden and Donald Trump, this is clearly
*  a phenomenon Americans are going to have to keep grappling with. Right. They're politicians and
*  even their politicians' children on trial. Exactly.
*  Well, Katie, thank you very much. We appreciate it. Thanks for having me.
*  Hunter Biden is likely to be sentenced in the next few months. He faces up to 25 years in prison.
*  But because he is a first time nonviolent offender,
*  the judge in the case may choose a more lenient punishment.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. In secret recordings made last week, Supreme Court Justice
*  Samuel Alito told a woman posing as a conservative Catholic that compromise in America between the
*  left and the right might be impossible.
*  At another point, Alito told the woman, who in real life is a liberal activist,
*  that he agreed with her claim that the United States must return to a place of godliness.
*  We believe in God, have got to keep fighting for that, to return our country to a place of godliness.
*  The unguarded remarks made at an annual dinner attended by Supreme Court justices
*  reinforces Alito's reputation as a committed social conservative, intent on safeguarding the
*  place of Christianity in American life. And they are likely to intensify questions about Alito's
*  impartiality. Alito is already under fire for allowing two flags associated with the January
*  6th riots at the U.S. Capitol to fly over his homes at various times following the 2020 election.
