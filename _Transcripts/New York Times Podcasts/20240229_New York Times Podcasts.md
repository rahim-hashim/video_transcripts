*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro. This is The Daily.
*  Today, a Times investigation has revealed how Apple Sauce leased with high levels of lead,
*  which poisoned hundreds of children across the U.S. sailed through a food safety system
*  meant to protect American consumers.
*  I spoke with my colleague, Christina Jewett, about what she found.
*  It's Thursday, February 29.
*  Christina, where does this story start?
*  So last summer, families all over America started to have sort of a mysterious problem.
*  Their kids had startlingly high blood-led levels.
*  And this is extremely alarming for all these families, because lead poisoning can lead
*  to behavior problems, learning problems, developmental problems as well.
*  And basically, no one knows where this is coming from.
*  Our daughter loves makeup and doing her nails.
*  And our son loves cars and airplanes.
*  Wow, it exhausts.
*  And one of the families in this situation is Nicole Peterson and Thomas Young.
*  They have two little kids, a little boy who's one and a daughter who's three.
*  And our son had gone to his first annual checkup, and they did a finger break, and this
*  lead level is high.
*  And during their routine pediatric visits for the summer, they learn that the kids have
*  high blood-led levels.
*  We're talking about triple to quadruple the CDC's level of concern, basically.
*  Wow.
*  It's kind of like a nightmare, right?
*  Those tough, very tough.
*  So that gets reported to the county.
*  The health department sends out an inspector.
*  He goes through their house with sort of this lead x-ray gun, and he's shooting everything.
*  Every pot pan toys open on the rice cooker, you know, to literally test everything.
*  This is a five-hour process.
*  The door frame, there was something in there, but there was no concern, because there was
*  no chipping, nowhere to it.
*  I was in cat-related as what he envisioned.
*  He finds some lead in a doorway in the basement.
*  He finds lead in a figurine that's sort of a family heirloom.
*  I'm antique birds that my grandmother had given me, you know, but out of reach, they're
*  seasonal, they don't.
*  The kids are not putting them in their mouth.
*  None of these things are what the kids are touching or eating or are really playing with
*  it all.
*  So it was really sort of a mystery.
*  And then the kids are screened again.
*  They get checked in the middle of August and they're in a blood level, doubled.
*  And the numbers have gone up into the 20s.
*  And so now everyone is, of course, very, very concerned.
*  Freaking out, they're saying that this has never happened before in county history that
*  this is the first time that they've seen this.
*  Thomas and I weren't sleeping, we're not eating.
*  Like this is driving us crazy and tormenting us.
*  So the family is freaking out.
*  The parents get their levels tested and it's normal.
*  So now they're really, really facing a mystery.
*  I mean, what are the kids exposed to that the parents are not?
*  So the county goes out to the daycare, looks at everything there.
*  They spend few hours at the daycare and nothing.
*  They didn't really have any answers.
*  They really didn't know where to go.
*  And this is the right direction.
*  And then the parents start a food diary.
*  We all eat the same food.
*  We don't eat different food.
*  The kids don't get one meal and we get another meal.
*  And so they realized that there's one thing that the kids eat that they don't.
*  Only thing that they eat that we don't eat are these pouches.
*  And it's these foil packets of cinnamon apple sauce
*  that the family gives the kids as a routine snack.
*  And they loved it.
*  They went to Bauer and they would eat it on the playground.
*  If they were just having a bow, you know, because...
*  Right, I mean, every parent, me included, gives their kids a pouch of apple sauce.
*  It is the universal food of the American toddler.
*  Exactly.
*  So what happens once the family narrows this down to applesauce?
*  So the county health inspector comes out.
*  They take samples of the packets.
*  They take it to the state health lab in North Carolina and they run some tests.
*  I think they...
*  They don't make it through.
*  Yeah, they call this on a Friday.
*  And they had that in the report back from the lab.
*  And then they had tested positive.
*  And what they find is basically an incredibly high level of lead in this apple sauce.
*  They forward that to the FDA, which quickly turns around
*  and works with the company that made it to issue a recall.
*  It was just so nice to have like a resolution,
*  like we know where this is coming from now.
*  And we don't have to drive ourselves crazy for this constant nightmare.
*  It's nice to have any answer.
*  And so millions of these packets that were sold at Dollar Tree under the name WanaBanna.
*  And also at Schnuck's Market and Weiss Market Grocery stores under the store brand.
*  Those are all recalled.
*  Wow.
*  And then the FDA tries to figure out how this lead got into the applesauce in the first place.
*  And what do they find?
*  So they pretty quickly narrow in on the cinnamon in the applesauce.
*  There's this known problem in the spice industry
*  where sometimes people will add lead chromate powder to sort of make the color pop.
*  And what is lead chromate?
*  Christina.
*  Lead chromate is an orange yellow powder.
*  It's still used in industrial applications overseas.
*  And even though it's toxic, sometimes people illegally add it to spices,
*  especially with temeric or curry powder,
*  that sometimes this is poured in to sort of bulk up the spices,
*  like a drug dealer sort of cuts the cocaine with flour or sugar or something.
*  So the FDA is realizing that could be what was happening in Ecuador,
*  where this applesauce was processed.
*  And officials from Ecuador are able to trace the cinnamon in the applesauce
*  up the supply chain to a spice grinder who they think is responsible.
*  Got it.
*  The FDA suspects that somebody grinding cinnamon is adding lead chromate to it,
*  basically to make more money on the production of that cinnamon.
*  Exactly.
*  And then it went to the company that made the applesauce,
*  which shipped it off to the US,
*  it landed in the ports of Baltimore and Miami,
*  and ended up right on grocery shelves to be handed to American
*  infants and toddlers.
*  And how many children, Christina, ended up consuming this lead poisoned applesauce?
*  We know the kids in 44 states had this applesauce.
*  The CDC has said that about 468 kids consumed this applesauce
*  and had high levels of lead in their blood.
*  The median level of lead in their blood was about six times higher
*  than what we saw with the Flint lead and water crisis about a decade ago.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  And as far as how many kids total, it could be so many more.
*  There's probably plenty of parents who didn't have a blood screening
*  who didn't connect it to the applesauce.
*  And there's certainly others that didn't meet the case definition.
*  By the time this was discovered, which required a certain level of lead in the blood.
*  Okay, so we're seeing at the very least, nearly 500 very small children
*  were consuming this contaminated applesauce
*  and it's discovered that their blood is filled with lead.
*  That's the very best case scenario.
*  Yeah.
*  This is one of the worst toxic exposures of US kids in decades.
*  And this Christina is where you and the times come in, right?
*  That's right.
*  I cover the FDA, which has a big infrastructure to protect our food supply.
*  And so I wanted to understand how this occurred.
*  So I teamed up with another reporter, Wilfitt's Gibbon,
*  who works for a nonprofit called the Examination.
*  It's a global health news organization.
*  And we wound up getting thousands of pages of documents from Ecuador
*  tracing their investigation and interviewed a number of food safety experts
*  to really figure out how the system failed to detect basically poisonous applesauce
*  going on to store shelves all over America.
*  Right.
*  Because ideally, you discover that applesauce is poisoned with lead
*  before it enters the food supply system, not after it's entered the blood of little children.
*  Exactly.
*  One expert I talked to basically said in this situation,
*  the kids were like the canary in the coal mine, which is not what you want to see happen
*  in a country with a sophisticated food safety system.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So once you all conduct this investigation, what do you find?
*  How did our regulatory system allow this applesauce to enter the US?
*  So in the US, the food safety system is pretty robust.
*  There are boots on the ground in every state,
*  routine inspections of food making facilities.
*  And there's some precedent of criminal prosecutions for big failures.
*  So things like salmonella in Listeria get discovered pretty routinely.
*  The biggest fears have always been about food that comes from outside the US.
*  Right.
*  Where we know less, you know, there can be things added for financial gain.
*  There can be pesticides we don't allow in the US.
*  And these fears really grow in the late 2000s with a scandal in China.
*  It's all about the chemical melamine.
*  It can make protein levels look normal in quality tests if milk has been watered down to cheat consumers.
*  People were adding this powder called melamine to infant formula and pet food.
*  And what it did was mimic protein powder, but it was also really toxic.
*  Nervous parents of rust children to hospitals when it was revealed baby formula was laced
*  with the industrial chemical melamine.
*  So six babies died in China.
*  Why didn't the government test the formula more carefully?
*  Ask this mother.
*  Hundreds of thousands of babies overseas got sick.
*  And dogs and cats all around America got sick and also died.
*  It's a black eye for China's leadership, consumer confidence in Chinese goods is falling
*  to an all-time low.
*  I remember this really well and it was seen as a wake up call that
*  there are some really bad actors in the world when it comes to food and food safety.
*  That's right.
*  So that creates some impetus to change the way the US overseas food that's imported from outside the US.
*  And that winds up sort of coming together in 2011 with President Obama signing the Food Safety Modernization Act.
*  That does a number of things.
*  One of them is to really try to plug the holes in the system of imported food that are meant to
*  prevent really what happened in China from happening again in the US.
*  And how does the new law envision that working?
*  Well, it does two big things.
*  One is there would be more overseas inspections of food making facilities.
*  So the FDA would actually send people into the food plants.
*  They would take a look at all their processes, their procedures, their test results,
*  how they're making the food safer to come into the US.
*  And that was actually supposed to reach a level of 19,000 inspections like that per year.
*  So in short, they wanted to treat international inspections the way that they treat domestic ones.
*  Make sure that there are a lot of them, that they're frequent and that they're likely to catch things.
*  That's right. The other thing it does is it puts US import companies, companies that import food.
*  And it essentially made them guardians of food that comes in to the US.
*  And they're not really used to having these food safety duties, but here they came anyway.
*  And so what they're supposed to do is look at the food they're importing,
*  identify the specific risks related to that food, and make sure those are dealt with.
*  And oftentimes they do this with consultants, and they're required to hire auditors to make sure
*  they're doing a good job of basically eliminating risks.
*  And sometimes these auditors go overseas and inspect the facilities on their behalf.
*  So on paper, this looks like a pretty tight ship, something that can keep the lead or the
*  bellamine out of the US. Right. And there's overdone density up play here from what you just said,
*  which is the US is going to be sending out inspectors itself to foreign food manufacturing facilities.
*  And it's going to be asking food importers to do their own auditing of their suppliers.
*  So the thinking I'm sure is that between those two, something will be caught.
*  Clearly though, that didn't happen in the case of the applesauce. So what did you learn about why
*  that is? So the law didn't quite work out as intended. The number of overseas inspections was
*  supposed to reach 19,000. Well, that didn't come to pass. Last year, there were 1200 inspections.
*  And so that means FDA inspectors got to about 1% of the overseas food facilities.
*  Wow. A tiny percentage. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And when it came to the company, an Ecuador that made
*  this apple sauce, the company's called Astro food, we found that the FDA hadn't been in that
*  facility since 2019. And when they were there, we don't think at the time they were using cinnamon.
*  And overall, the FDA didn't find any problems that they recommended fixing.
*  So I really wanted to pause on this. No one from the United States government,
*  despite the ambitions of this law, had visited the facility where this apple sauce was made
*  in the last five years. So if there were any problems with any product, leaving those facilities
*  and headed for the US, the US government had no eyes and no years on any of it. Not on site now.
*  And when we took a look at the second line of defense that's supposed to keep things like
*  toxic apple sauce out of the US, the importers, we found out thousands of them just never set up
*  programs to vet foreign food. Wow. So they hadn't taken up this guardian role that the government
*  was trying to give them. In fact, the FDA has issued about 3,400 citations to companies
*  that weren't doing this at all. So in this situation with the importers, no one would tell us exactly
*  what happened with the apple sauce. But basically what we could piece together is that there was an
*  auditor sent out to the apple sauce making company in Ecuador late last year. And when they took
*  a look around, they wound up giving this company a grade of A plus even as their headlines all across
*  the United States about kids being poisoned by lead tainted apple sauce. So in the case of the
*  apple sauce, you're saying the auditor working on behalf of an importer whose job it is now to
*  protect US consumers ends up issuing a pretty much perfect rating to the maker of this apple sauce.
*  Even though of course we know that the apple sauce is contaminated, suggesting that that auditor
*  was clearly not doing their job very well. Right. And a lot of the experts we talked to said this
*  is kind of an honor system. And when they say that, they're talking about the fact that all these
*  companies have the discretion to choose which risks to worry about. In this case with this audit,
*  it looks like the concern was Salmanella. So this lead that's widespread, well known at this point,
*  was a non-concerned as far as that audit went. Christian, I'm curious. In this American system,
*  what you described so far are the responsibilities of inspections overseas, whether that's done by
*  the FDA at a manufacturing site or by an importer who's supposed to hire an auditor to go to the
*  facility. But once international food reaches the US, is there ever a moment where the American
*  system kicks in and tests food opens up a package or a pouch of apple sauce and tests it?
*  You know, there is. There are tests that occur at the border, at the ports of entry. And the
*  inspectors will open up a pouch of apple sauce and test it. But the number of these tests has
*  actually gone down. It's really fallen in half over the last decade. And at the same time, the number
*  of imported food products has gone way up. It's really at a all-time high, just down a hair from where
*  it was in 2022. So in essence, the border searches, those are really like looking for a needle in a
*  haystack. Based on your reporting, I wonder if you have concluded that what happened here is the
*  fault of a poorly constructed law or its lacks enforcement. Or if this is just a reality that
*  in a global food supply chain with so many elements and manufacturers and facilities that it's just
*  going to be hard to detect something like a malevolent cinnamon supplier, you know, who adds
*  a terrible toxin to food. I mean, yeah, I think in the best of systems, it's easy to envision how
*  something could slip through. But this is such a close parallel to what our nation really grappled
*  with almost 15 years ago in creating this new system of inspections and audits. And what our
*  investigation found really was that the system's not living up to those requirements at all. The
*  inspections aren't anywhere close to where they were envisioned to be. The audits that were
*  supposed to be happening in many cases aren't happening at all. Right, you're saying even the best
*  of systems might not catch something, but we don't have the best of systems. We don't even have
*  the system that the law requires. Exactly. So I want to return to the family that we met at the
*  start of this conversation. How worried are they about what this led poisoning will mean for
*  those two very small children and what do we understand to be the prognosis for those two kids?
*  Yes. Well, for all the families, the concern is that lead lives in the body forever.
*  It's in the bones and your kid has a growth spurt and some of that lead can come out.
*  There are different, you know, junctures in your life where the lead can come out. So there are
*  life-long ramifications. And for Nicole and Thomas, the family we met from North Carolina,
*  the health system takes this very seriously. So they've been provided with nutritional counseling.
*  They've been provided with specialists to help the kids meet their developmental milestones.
*  But there is a sense that things will never be quite the same for them.
*  They can't just walk into the grocery store, toss things into the cart blindly without having
*  a second thought. After what happened to their young children, there'll be a lingering sense I
*  would imagine that the system really did fail them.
*  Well, Christina, thank you very much. Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. One of life's most underappreciated talents
*  is to know when it's time to move on to life's next chapter.
*  On Wednesday, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the leader of the Senate Republicans for the
*  past two decades, said he would give up that rule at the end of the year.
*  During a speech on the Senate floor announcing the decision, McConnell acknowledged that his policies,
*  especially his view that supporting Ukraine is essential to U.S. national security,
*  are increasingly out of step with the rest of his party and its de facto presidential nominee,
*  Donald Trump. Believe me, I know the politics of the end-by-party
*  at this particular moment in time. I have many faults. This understanding politics is not one of.
*  And in a stunning admission of financial strain, Trump said he could offer a bond of only 100
*  million toward a Manhattan court judgment of 450 million that he must pay in the coming weeks.
*  If that bond is not accepted, Trump said he may need to sell some of his properties to come up
*  with more cash. The admission made in a court filing highlights the degree to which the
*  $450 million penalty punishment for a year's long financial fraud has created a cash crunch for
*  the former president.
