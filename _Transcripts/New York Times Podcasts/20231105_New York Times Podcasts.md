# The Sunday Read: ‘The Botched Hunt for the Gilgo Beach Killer’
**NewYorkTimesPodcasts:** [November 05, 2023](https://rr2---sn-ab5sznze.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?expire=1711045202&ei=8iX8ZcepN-2N_9EPsNKT4A0&ip=2603%3A7000%3A3200%3Ade9e%3A68a7%3Ae516%3Aff66%3A8d9d&id=o-AMbiUuYW-VNs0YvT_pylgPfb-WrQPFNS2C5PO6zR1Wx6&itag=139&source=youtube&requiressl=yes&xpc=EgVo2aDSNQ%3D%3D&mh=Zz&mm=31%2C26&mn=sn-ab5sznze%2Csn-p5qlsn7l&ms=au%2Conr&mv=m&mvi=2&pl=37&initcwndbps=2853750&vprv=1&mime=audio%2Fmp4&gir=yes&clen=19975189&dur=3275.567&lmt=1699190964778116&mt=1711023184&fvip=2&keepalive=yes&c=ANDROID_EMBEDDED_PLAYER&txp=6218224&sparams=expire%2Cei%2Cip%2Cid%2Citag%2Csource%2Crequiressl%2Cxpc%2Cvprv%2Cmime%2Cgir%2Cclen%2Cdur%2Clmt&sig=AJfQdSswRQIgAwi1zYnMubIRcAelraMfrpiCDuiaIEaaiKqo1QBLt_cCIQD6Ar_hDeCzS47g_QT_iKTFlyOWWR0E8aoKPBG9pQKe2Q%3D%3D&lsparams=mh%2Cmm%2Cmn%2Cms%2Cmv%2Cmvi%2Cpl%2Cinitcwndbps&lsig=ALClDIEwRQIgOB9k9hZq8A6skK2mqhdHPvSNdaqSV3zLTHJrhh2cbHcCIQCZWTRHyQAUz0ZVElCulJy-xPAszRC19VnjrsTpmvBYpQ%3D%3D)
*  I first heard about this case 13 years ago, in 2010.
*  Four sets of human remains were found on the side of a highway on Long Island, just
*  an hour's drive from New York City.
*  At the time I'd been reporting about crime and murder, so this case seemed like a natural
*  fit for me.
*  But I resisted writing about it, at first.
*  As I thought that the case would be solved, basically by the time I got into my car.
*  There had been the Craigslist killer case up in New England 18 months earlier, and that
*  person had been caught in just two days.
*  But that's not what happened here.
*  What started out as the discovery of four women's remains, ballooned to include as many as
*  10 or 11 possible victims.
*  These became known as the Gilgo Beach Killings, or the Long Island serial killer case.
*  And what made it especially strange, to me at least, was that they took place so close
*  to New York City.
*  The idea that a killer or killers could operate unnoticed for years, and perhaps decades,
*  in the same general area so close to New York, it's just shocking that it went unsolved.
*  My name's Robert Kulker, and I'm a contributing writer for the New York Times magazine.
*  The Gilgo Beach case defied expectations in other ways.
*  The first four women had something in common, that they all participated in sex work.
*  Back then, I probably would have believed in the cruel stereotype our culture has about
*  murder victims like this, that they're off the grid, or outcasts from their families,
*  that no one knows who they are, or that the bodies would never be identified.
*  But it turned out that not only were the victims identified right away, but their families
*  had been searching for them, and they wanted attention for the cases.
*  And so that led to a magazine story, and then a book called Lost Girls, which came out
*  in 2013.
*  Lost girls focused on the victims and their families, but the case was still unsolved.
*  The police had no suspects or persons of interest, and it seemed like it would be like that
*  for some time.
*  After the book was published, years went by, and I remained frustrated by the lack of progress
*  in this case.
*  Then, on a Friday morning last July, I was out in the park taking my dog for a walk,
*  when I got a text from my wife.
*  There'd been an arrest in the case.
*  I was stunned.
*  The suspect was Rex Heurman, a 59-year-old married father of two.
*  He worked as an architect in Manhattan.
*  Some people might have suspected a loner would be the suspect here, but he was anything
*  but a loner.
*  He was a family man in a densely populated town, Massive Equipark, and he commuted into
*  Manhattan where he ran a pretty high-profile architecture business.
*  He seemed to be hiding in plain sight.
*  But more than that, based on the police investigations into him, he was patronizing
*  escorts, he was on Tinder, he had 97 gun permits, he was not exactly hiding.
*  And all of that led to the question of what about the 12 years before that?
*  What took so long to consider this guy a suspect?
*  This week's Sunday read is my year-by-year examination of the failures and shortcomings
*  of the Suffolk County Police and District Attorney's Office's investigation into the
*  Gilgowe Beach murders.
*  Unlike the first time I reported on this case, people returned my phone calls.
*  I spoke on and off the record with people who had very close views of what was going
*  on in the investigation over the years.
*  And they were saying things that really surprised me.
*  The truth was that it wasn't just apathy and it wasn't just indifference, it also was
*  actively turning a blind eye to things that could be helpful.
*  I learned about how they had information almost on day one that could have helped them
*  find this suspect, including the description of Rex Herman and the car he drove.
*  I learned that they weren't interested in modern investigative techniques, like analyzing
*  cell phone data.
*  I learned that they didn't even digitize the case files.
*  They never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity.
*  So here's my article, The Bouched Hunt for the Gilgowe Beach Killer, read by Robert Petkov.
*  The beginning of the story was strangely familiar, like the opening scene in a shop-worn
*  police procedural.
*  A woman runs screaming down a street in Oak Beach, a secluded gated community on Long
*  Island's South Shore, only to vanish, it seems, into thin air.
*  It was almost dawn on May 1, 2010.
*  Hours earlier, Shannon Gilbert traveled from New Jersey to see a man who had hired her
*  as an escort from a Craigslist ad.
*  By the time the police arrived, she was gone.
*  They talked to the neighbors, the John and her driver and came up with nothing.
*  A few days later, they ordered a flyover of the area and again saw no sign of her.
*  Then they essentially threw up their hands.
*  She went into the ocean, they decided, either hysterical or on drugs.
*  None of this made the news, not at first.
*  A missing sex worker rarely does.
*  Not even when another woman advertising on Craigslist, Megan Waterman was reported missing
*  a month later.
*  As spring turned to summer, each of those missing persons' cases grew cold.
*  No one else was brought in for questioning and no more searches were conducted.
*  But by November, the Bramble bordering the beaches on the South Shore was less thick, and
*  so the police ordered a detective with a cadaver sniffing dog as part of the dog's regular
*  training exercises to explore the area near where Gilbert disappeared, up and down the
*  shoulder of Ocean Parkway, the main artery of the South Shore.
*  On December 11, the detective and the dog found something at Gilgo Beach, a skeleton found
*  in Burlap.
*  Two days later, the police found three more.
*  Four skeletons in all secured with Burlap and positioned just a tenth of a mile away
*  from one another in the Bramble off the side of a deserted stretch of seaside highway.
*  The police were shocked.
*  Who were these women?
*  After a series of DNA tests, they learned that two had been missing for years.
*  Maureen Brainerd Barnes, last heard from at Penn Station in 2007, and Melissa Bartholomey,
*  who vanished from the Bronx in 2009.
*  Their families had begged the police to look for them.
*  The third was Waterman, whom a lead investigator told me recently they never imagined they would
*  find there.
*  The fourth, Amber Costello, disappeared in September 2010, a few months after Gilbert
*  and Waterman.
*  She was last seen darting out of her house in nearby Babylon, a short drive from Gilgo
*  Beach to meet a man in his car.
*  All these women fit a certain profile.
*  They were petite and in their twenties and had come to New York to make money as escorts
*  on Craigslist.
*  This was, quite obviously, a serial killer case.
*  The only person not saying as much was the Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard
*  Dormer.
*  I don't want anyone to think we have a jacked the ripper running around Suffolk County
*  with blood dripping from a knife, he said, in a frenzied news conference.
*  In fact, they had something almost exactly like that.
*  All eyes were on the Suffolk police now, wondering who killed these women if they would ever
*  find Gilbert and what it would take to solve the mystery.
*  The police brought no one in for questioning.
*  They declared no persons of interest.
*  Conspiracy theories filled the vacuum.
*  With Gilbert still missing, they resumed the search in spring.
*  Incredibly, they found more human remains, ten in all, including a man and a toddler.
*  This was when the Long Island serial killer case lost all recognizable shape.
*  Bodies on the beach, more of them each day.
*  Cable networks, the one hour true crime shows and the documentary crews descending on
*  the South Shore.
*  The images from this time became indelible.
*  Platoons of uniformed personnel in the mist, combing through the bramble, fire trucks with
*  long ladders extended out and over the beach brush.
*  The images peering down with binoculars from elevated buckets.
*  The only thing missing was a strong lead.
*  In lieu of results, the police tried to manage expectations.
*  This, dormer said plaintively at another news conference, is not an episode of CSI.
*  The media's tone changed from alarm to confusion.
*  These women used their phones to meet the killer.
*  Certainly something must be traceable.
*  The original Craigslist killer, Philip Markov, who left a digital trail after responding
*  to an ad in the erotic services page of Craigslist in Boston, was found in a matter of days.
*  He murdered one woman.
*  How hard could it be to find a killer with four digital trails or more?
*  As the spring of 2011 wore on, the police seemed aggrieved.
*  At times they subtly blamed the victims.
*  In a meeting meant to calm the public, the chief of detectives said these women went out
*  to meet this killer because they were willing to get into a car with a stranger, and that
*  it was a consolation that the killer was not selecting citizens at large.
*  He's selecting from a pool.
*  There was a growing feeling on the part of some police officers that all this was happening
*  to them.
*  That it seemed almost arbitrary that ten cold cases, 11 including Gilbert, crash landed
*  in the middle of their jurisdiction.
*  And then, as time wore on, the police updates stopped.
*  To observers, the investigation seemed to stall entirely.
*  This summer, after 13 years, the police finally made an arrest in the Gilgho beach murders,
*  Rex Hewerman is a 59-year-old architect and married father of two who commuted to
*  Manhattan from his home in Massapique, Wapark, a bustling bedroom community in central Long
*  Island.
*  Hewerman had been in plain sight the whole time in any number of ways.
*  According to prosecutors, he had 97 gun permits, an astonishing number by any standard
*  that you think would raise a few eyebrows in any cursory search.
*  He patronized escorts, causing some to wonder who else potentially he might have harmed.
*  While the families of the victims who had been waiting for this moment were overwhelmed
*  by the news of the arrest, they also wondered why it took so long.
*  Since the case's early days, law enforcement officers have rarely spoken to the media.
*  When I was reporting Lost Girls, my 2013 book about the case and victims, the police were
*  largely silent.
*  But after Hewerman's arrest, some had been willing to discuss the investigation with
*  a greater degree of detail and candor.
*  Since July, I've conducted interviews with people close to the Gilgho case during every
*  chapter of its bizarre 13-year timeline.
*  Several sources asked for anonymity, concerned that public statements by insiders might
*  undercut the case against Hewerman before the trial.
*  The story they tell at times self-serving and at other times soul-searching demonstrates
*  inadvertently and otherwise how institutional rot helped contribute to the delays and paralysis
*  of the investigation.
*  What started out as indifference and apathy soon curdled into obstinance, willful ignorance
*  and corruption.
*  From the moment these women were found at Gilgho Beach, the law enforcement culture of Suffolk
*  County seemed so preternaturally ill-suited to handle this case that a killer was allowed
*  to roam free, which was all the more galling given what we know now, that everything the
*  police needed to solve the case, they had almost on day one.
*  To understand what went wrong with the Gilgho case, it helps to have a passing familiarity
*  with the dark, contradictory nature of Suffolk County, encompassing some of the most
*  rarefied communities in the world, including the Hamptons and Fire Island, as well as struggling
*  towns like Brentwood, Wyandanch, and Central Islip.
*  It's a place full of sophisticated, powerful people, where time and again, law enforcement
*  has closed ranks and done things their way, often with little oversight.
*  In the 1970s, to take one notable example, the Suffolk County Police Department's homicide
*  unit was known for an impossibly high confession rate of 97%, which almost certainly meant
*  they engaged in coercion.
*  When that statistic made the news, officers in that unit proudly took to wearing t-shirts
*  with the insignia 97%.
*  Officials have at times ignored and even enabled those excesses.
*  In 1988, a teenager named Martin Tankliffe was driven to confess falsely to the murder
*  of his father.
*  It would take almost 18 years for him to be exonerated and released.
*  And a year later, in 1989, New York's Commission of Investigation issued a report lambasting
*  the Suffolk Police and the District Attorney's Office and citing evidence of more coerced
*  confessions, plus illegal wiretaps, preferential treatment for people close to public officials,
*  and the practice of sweeping law enforcement misconduct under the rug.
*  The police often went unchecked because in Suffolk County, their union is a powerful source
*  of campaign contributions with its own super PAC.
*  The union's political clout helps explain why the Suffolk Police Department is one of
*  the nation's largest, with about 2,500 sworn officers and their salaries are among the
*  highest.
*  A politician who supports the police can earn the union's backing and ensure a swift rise
*  to the top.
*  And for many decades, any District Attorney with Ambition would not look too closely at police
*  indiscretions and even indulge them, or better still, use them to consolidate political
*  power.
*  When Thomas Spota first became District Attorney in 2002, he was perceived as a white knight,
*  largely expected to clean house after an era of corruption.
*  But Spota, it became clear later, found ways to install his own allies in police leadership
*  positions, which in turn would secure the union's support.
*  When the Gilgo case emerged eight years into Spota's tenure, he was actively reshaping
*  the police department.
*  Even as the body count around Gilgo Beach Rose, the media took up residence on the South
*  Shore and investigators struggled to handle an unprecedented case involving at least one
*  serial killer.
*  The Suffolk detectives had more than enough to deal with in those first few months.
*  Ten possible victims meant ten different sets of evidence, not just bodies, but also
*  physical evidence and phone records.
*  The police knew the killer targeted women who posted ads on Craigslist.
*  They knew he used camouflage burlap straps to bind them, the kind of hunter uses.
*  They knew he used hard to trace burner phones to contact each woman, a different phone
*  for each victim.
*  Sixteen calls or texts to Marine Brainerd Barnes before she vanished in 2009 and four
*  before Melissa Bartholomey disappeared.
*  At the time, the burner phones made him seem clever, a loyal watcher of certain police
*  procedures, perhaps.
*  But the killer made mistakes, too.
*  Police knew he used tape to wrap the victims and found at least a few hairs.
*  With the right technology furnished by the FBI or an outside lab with expertise, they
*  might be able to extract DNA and find a match, provided they had a suspect's DNA to compare
*  it with.
*  They also recovered a belt on the scene with initials, either H.M. or WH.
*  The police started to understand where this killer might operate, where he lived, and
*  maybe where he worked.
*  They learned how in the summer of 2009, the killer made taunting phone calls from Midtown
*  Manhattan to Melissa Bartholomey's younger sister using Melissa's phone.
*  Brainerd Barnes' phone also connected to a cell tower in Midtown Manhattan near the
*  Queensborough Bridge, the bridge a person might take if they were heading to Long Island
*  before she vanished in 2007.
*  Waterman's phone last registered at a cell tower in Central Long Island near Massa Pequip
*  Park, so did Bartholomey's.
*  Here was a pattern, a killer who potentially commuted between Central Long Island and Midtown
*  Manhattan.
*  These were densely populated areas where it might seem impossible that he could ever be
*  traced.
*  And yet, during the first year of the Gilgo case in 2011, the FBI started to provide help
*  on that front, technology that might track those burner phones by seeing if their numbers
*  appeared in the records of certain cell towers on Long Island.
*  Cell tower data is voluminous, a haystack full of needles.
*  Think of all the signals from all the phones that ping at various cell towers every second.
*  But if any of the killers burner phones pinged at the same towers, they would have a sense
*  of where, perhaps, he spent most of his time.
*  If this seemed promising, suffix investigation for most of 2011 was essentially at a standstill,
*  in part because the district attorney Spota was stepping up his efforts to orchestrate
*  a soft takeover of the police.
*  He went public with his fury at the existing police leadership in May after senior officials
*  suggested that a single killer might be responsible for all the murders.
*  Spota was so incensed by the one killer theory a former senior police officer told me recently
*  because he believed it encouraged panic.
*  That heightens the alarm to everyone that we have an active killer, that it could happen
*  again.
*  Days later, Spota held a news conference of his own.
*  He made sure Richard Dormer, the police commissioner, was standing there as he spoke, a public
*  defenestration.
*  Dormer has no idea what Spota is going to say, the former senior officer recalled, and
*  Spota runs the whole show.
*  He's got the clipboards up and he shows where all the bodies are laid out.
*  It's very telling.
*  Spota announced that there could be as many as three killers at work on Long Island
*  that the South Shore might have been a dumping ground.
*  It is clear that the area in and around Gilgo Beach has been used to discard human remains
*  for some period of time, Spota declared, as distasteful and disturbing as that is, there
*  is no evidence that all of these remains are the work of a single killer.
*  Among the police and the media, those watching the case were baffled.
*  There isn't an open disagreement between the police commissioner and the district attorney
*  a gift to any future defense lawyer handling the case at trial, but insiders understood
*  that this wasn't so much about solving this case as it was about Spota's larger ambitions.
*  They knew that Dormer was an appointee of Steve Levy, the county executive, and Spota's
*  political foe, and that Spota was going after them both.
*  Typically, he excoriated Dormer, while privately he had Levy investigated for campaign finance
*  in propriety.
*  In March, two months before this news conference, Spota pressured Levy to drop his bid for re-election
*  in return for not being prosecuted.
*  Dormer was out as commissioner before the end of the year.
*  The public would never learn exactly what Levy supposedly did, a classic Suffolk County
*  backroom deal, and his successor, Steve Ballon, was happy to sign off on a new chief of
*  the police department who happened to be a long-time protégé of Spotas, and who, to the
*  eternal detriment of the Gilgoye investigation, would go on to become widely known as the
*  most corrupt police official in modern Suffolk history.
*  Shortly after the bodies were identified by DNA in early 2011, the police visited the
*  home of Amber Costello, the most recent victim, in a rented house in Babylon.
*  All summer before her disappearance in September, she shared the home with her boyfriend Bjorn
*  Brodski and a friend Dave Schaller.
*  The place was a drug pit, well known to neighbors who had been watching cars coming and going
*  for months.
*  All three housemates spent most of their days doing heroin with Costello's sister popping
*  by for visits.
*  The money for the heroin came from Costello's escort work, starting at $250 a call.
*  Schaller at the time said that during Costello's last night at the house, she was on the phone
*  with a potential client and arrived at an unusually high fee, $1,500 for the whole night.
*  She asked to meet him outside the house.
*  Schaller walked Costello out the door, but he didn't see Costello's client.
*  He wrote in a 2012 Facebook post that he was too high to remember him.
*  But the police had access to Costello's phone records, and they saw that the same man
*  she was talking with had also been texting her the night before.
*  They even saw a text message suggesting he had met with her in person that first night.
*  Costello seemed mad that something had gone wrong and he wanted to see her again.
*  The police learned that on the first night, the client wanted to hire Costello, but as
*  soon as he paid, Schaller jumped out of the shadows and chased him away.
*  This was a scam Schaller and Brodsky pulled whenever they could that summer, are costing
*  Costello's clients and taking their money before she had to follow through with the job.
*  But this time, the client seemed to want another chance.
*  They started looking for anyone who could remember seeing the client on that first night.
*  They found a witness who saw a large white male, six foot four or taller, resembling an
*  ogre in his mid forties with dark, bushy hair and big glasses.
*  The witness also spotted the car this man drove, a green Chevrolet avalanche with a distinctive
*  rear door like a trucks.
*  At that moment, with the description of a man and a make, model and color of a car, the
*  police were closer to targeting a suspect than they had ever been.
*  And then, the lead withered away.
*  The initial database search for the car went nowhere.
*  A source close to the Gilgo investigators told me that the detectives were using a program
*  known as Lawman, a product of 1990's database technology accessing millions of New York
*  states paper DMV records.
*  When it first became available, the Lawman search seemed like a godsend.
*  Pretty much everything that sat in the DMV archives was instantly searchable.
*  But over the years, as databases age, their data becomes harder to navigate.
*  New cars like avalanches which are a blend of a truck and a car could be misfiled by the
*  DMV and what gets mangled by the DMV can disappear entirely in the Lawman searches.
*  In retrospect, the source told me, the car must have been miscategorized.
*  It's hard to imagine that the police would not at least have tried to continue pursuing
*  eyewitness information about the last man to see Castella alive.
*  But that did not happen.
*  Just like that, the police seemed to stop talking about the ogre and the avalanche, not
*  with their superiors in the department and not with an outside agency like the state police
*  or the FBI.
*  A senior police official with close knowledge of the investigation's first year told
*  me that he had no recollection of the avalanche tip.
*  The chief of detectives at the time, Dominic Verone, has also said he heard nothing about
*  it.
*  For a decade, the lead sat at the bottom of a growing case file with no sign that it
*  might ever be discovered again.
*  On the same time, the department was adrift, waiting for Spotas handpicked police chief
*  to arrive.
*  James Burke was a former Suffolk narcotics detective whose alliance with Spotas spanned decades, almost
*  like a blood tie.
*  In a 1979 case that brought him recognition as a young prosecutor, Spotas secured the
*  convictions of two teenage defendants for the murder of a 13-year-old boy named John
*  Pius.
*  A key witness was Burke, who at the time was just 14.
*  A decade later, participants in the case claimed that witnesses had been coached to lie
*  on the stand.
*  Spoto was never charged with and has denied any wrongdoing.
*  And his bond with Burke never wavered.
*  Even years later, when Burke ran into trouble.
*  As a police officer, Burke lost track of his firearm more than once.
*  In 1993, an internal affairs investigation accused him of patronizing and smoking crack
*  with a sex worker.
*  Spota, who was in private practice at the time, offered to represent Burke.
*  Burke eventually was punished with the loss of 15 vacation days.
*  Once Spota became district attorney in 2002, he gave Burke a senior role overseeing a group
*  of detectives in his office.
*  It was clear back then to Spota's staff that one day, when Spota had the chance, he
*  would put Burke in charge of the police department.
*  With Burke arriving as chief in 2012, Spota managed to do what even in Suffolk County once
*  seemed impossible, consolidate political power between the police and the district attorney's
*  office.
*  There was nothing to hold back the impulse to close ranks and remove all outside scrutiny.
*  It was, hey, we run our own shop, stay out, alone the county executive during much of Spota's
*  tenure told me.
*  When in early 2012, staff members from the FBI's celebrated behavioral analysis unit arrived
*  in New York from Quantico, Virginia to help with the case at the invitation of the previous
*  leaders of the police department, Spota had them turn around and fly back home, declaring
*  their work unnecessary.
*  The loss of the FBI's help was a severe blow to the Gilgo investigation, impeding any meaningful
*  progress in the case.
*  Before being shut out, the FBI handed the police a raft of cell tower information that they
*  had collected over the past several months.
*  Their analysis traced the signals from the killer's burner phones to two regions on a map.
*  Graphic boxes, they called them, one in Central Long Island, including Massa Pequipark
*  and one in Midtown Manhattan.
*  As a next step, the FBI was willing to help search cell tower data in Central Long Island
*  for other cell phone numbers that registered with those towers at the same time as the killer's
*  burner phones.
*  In theory, whoever used those burner phones also carried a regular phone that pinged the
*  same towers at the same time.
*  That number, unlike the burners, would be traceable.
*  Spota abandoned this entire approach.
*  He refused to petition the courts to search any more cell tower data on Long Island.
*  Spota's staff members, who would have had to request the warrants for that data, waved
*  off the idea as a fishing expedition.
*  They didn't understand it and they didn't want to litigate something that they didn't
*  understand.
*  The source close to the Gilgo investigators told me.
*  In truth, cell tower data was hardly novel.
*  In 2004, it helped disprove the alibi of the accused California wife killer Scott Peterson.
*  A different district attorney might have seen where the data led.
*  There were other ways for Spota to rationalize not squandering time and resources on cell tower
*  data.
*  Just because the killer made some calls from Central Long Island didn't mean he had to
*  be living there.
*  Clearly, the killer was good at avoiding detection.
*  He seemed too smart to continue living a few miles from where the bodies were found.
*  By now, he had to be a ghost.
*  The problem with that argument was that every lead they had upon examination could be written
*  off as a long shot.
*  A police source who was part of the early investigation told me that they had been pulling
*  hunting licenses in the area because the burlap found on the bodies suggested the killer
*  was a hunter.
*  They appeared to drop that strategy, but Rex Hewerman, it turns out, was an enthusiastic
*  hunter.
*  I find it hard to believe his name isn't somewhere.
*  The source told me.
*  Despite that initial interest in hunting licenses, the team hadn't concentrated on gun permits.
*  The victims weren't shot.
*  The source close to the Gilgo investigators told me.
*  This was technically true.
*  The bodies had no signs of gun trauma, causing many to speculate that they were strangled.
*  But a different set of investigators, one that closely partnered with other agencies
*  like the FBI or the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, might have looked
*  at gun permits and noticed the man in Massa Pequo Park with 97.
*  In the four years that Burke ran the police department from 2012 to 2015, the Gilgo Room
*  at Suffolk Police Headquarters became a place for part-time work with little urgency dictated
*  from above.
*  Under Burke, the police were in what would later be characterized by federal prosecutors
*  as a complete, ethical freefall.
*  His staff served drinks in his office every night.
*  He ordered officers to spy on his girlfriend, her exes, and her son, and follow his perceived
*  adversaries, including Steve Bologna, the county executive.
*  He turned the police force into his own empire, punishing anyone he deemed disloyal and then
*  celebrating with friends after their demotion.
*  Instead of prioritizing the search for an at-large serial killer, Spota 2 seemed more interested
*  in investigating his rivals, including Bologna, who recalled being approached more than once
*  by Spota's staff, apparently just to let him know they were watching.
*  DA is the most powerful office that we have.
*  Bologna told me, if you're willing to target people and go after people, that is an awesome
*  power.
*  You don't even have to indict somebody to ruin their life.
*  Just starting to investigate someone can cause people to lose jobs.
*  For about a year, things went smoothly for Spota and Burke until Burke spoiled everything
*  with an unchecked explosion of violence inside a Suffolk Police precinct house.
*  In December 2012, a witness in a drug case who also happened to be pilfering from police
*  vehicles grabbed a duffel bag from Burke's car that contained pornography, sex toys,
*  cigars, a gun belt, and ammunition.
*  Federal prosecutors would later call this duffel Burke's party bag.
*  When Burke found out, he attacked the witness in full view of several other detectives,
*  some of whom took part in the beating and even bragged about it later.
*  Several agents started investigating Burke in April and Burke spent the next year or so
*  pressuring witnesses to take part in a cover-up.
*  He had help from Spota's staff who used wiretaps and car-tracking devices to monitor police
*  detectives he distrusted, searching for blackmail material.
*  Instead of filing subpoenas for more cell tower data in the Gilgo case, Spota's staff
*  were wiretapping a police detective they suspected of leaking information about a gang case
*  to Newsday, the Long Island newspaper.
*  The tapes included calls between the detectives and FBI agents, as well as the federal prosecutors
*  involved in the investigation into Burke.
*  By law, Spota needed to notify Loretta Lynch, then the US attorney for the Eastern District
*  of New York, when federal agents appeared on police wiretaps.
*  When he did, one source told the Times in 2016, federal officials immediately saw how
*  far a field those wiretaps went, and how perhaps the whole point may have been to learn
*  how close the FBI might be to taking down Burke.
*  The problem for them, alone told me, was that they didn't know that President Obama was
*  going to nominate Loretta Lynch to be the attorney general of the United States.
*  Once that happened, the federal investigation into Burke expanded into an inquiry of all
*  of Suffolk County law enforcement.
*  Lynch's office issued immunity orders, or a requirement to testify to witnesses in the
*  department who had seen Burke in action.
*  Burke was indicted and pleaded guilty in 2016 to conspiring to obstruct justice and violating
*  the civil rights of the witness he had beaten.
*  He served a sentence of 46 months.
*  Back home on Long Island, he still receives a pension.
*  In a bleak but strangely resonant moment, Burke was arrested this August for soliciting
*  sex in a public park.
*  He has pleaded not guilty, and the case is still proceeding.
*  Spota resigned in 2017, the day after he was indicted on charges of conspiracy, obstruction
*  of justice, witness tampering, and other crimes.
*  Belon, finally free of Spota's surveillance and intimidation, said during a news conference
*  that Spota and Burke had been running a criminal enterprise.
*  In December 2019, Spota was convicted in federal court and later sentenced to five years.
*  He's still in prison.
*  Spota and Burke were gone, but the bunker mentality remained.
*  No one collided with that culture more directly than Tim Seney, who became police commissioner
*  in 2015 just after Burke's indictment.
*  Seney, a senior prosecutor in Manhattan under the US attorney, Preet Bharara, was hired
*  to clean up the mess Burke left behind.
*  The problem was that those very credentials made Seney suspect to many in the department,
*  never mind that he was commissioner of a police force without ever having been a police
*  officer himself.
*  Seney sensed pushback from the start.
*  There's this culture of, you know, this is our town and we do it our way, he told me.
*  Seney wanted to modernize the Gilgo investigation.
*  He brought the FBI back in, asking for help with the cell phone piece of the case.
*  He invested in new equipment, including the Gladiator Autonomous Receiver or Gar.
*  A burner phone's signal from a tower suggests a huge geographical area, but the gar can make
*  that area smaller.
*  So essentially what that did was reduce your number of persons of interest, he said.
*  But these efforts were met with resistance from the detectives handling Gilgo.
*  That disagreement came to a head in 2018, when Seney was elected as the district attorney
*  and started pushing the police to find two specific suspects in those geographic areas,
*  one of them a former police officer.
*  A source with knowledge of the investigation told me that Seney was treated as if he had
*  somehow broken protocol and failed to understand that the police department decided who did
*  and didn't receive subpoenas.
*  Both of Seney's suggested targets were ruled out as suspects.
*  The source close to the Gilgo investigators told me that they felt that Seney, an outsider
*  using Suffolk County as a step on his political ladder to higher office, was more interested
*  in looking busy than getting results.
*  We made them look foolish by knocking out their potential suspects.
*  The source said.
*  Some police were also upset that Seney was diving into Suffolk County's history of
*  botched murder cases.
*  As soon as he became district attorney, he opened the county's first conviction integrity
*  unit, an office that reviewed past cases in which police malfeasance led to gross injustices.
*  In 2019, that unit successfully exposed wrongdoing in a legendary case from Suffolk's past.
*  The beating and confession of Keith Bush, who was convicted in 1977 and spent 33 years
*  in prison for a murder, he didn't commit.
*  The Bush case now stands as the longest wrongful incarceration in New York State history.
*  But the past is never past in Suffolk County.
*  At least one senior Gilgo detective knew some of the players in the case personally, officers
*  discredited by the exoneration.
*  Seney said that he may not have appreciated at the time that reopening the Bush case was
*  a declaration of war on the establishment.
*  The conflict between the police and Seney seemed to have a direct effect on the Gilgo case.
*  Seney's office kept narrowing the data that police needed to investigate and the police
*  kept not doing anything with that data.
*  By the summer of 2021, the source with knowledge of the investigation told me, the geographic
*  areas had been reduced to the smallest yet on Long Island and in Midtown Manhattan.
*  This source suggested that fewer than 1,000 men lived in the Long Island area.
*  All that was left was to see which of them worked in that tiny sliver of Manhattan.
*  It was eminently doable, the source said, but it just didn't happen.
*  Seney's team reached out to neighboring Nassau County where Massapico Park is to help
*  create a list of homes within the geographic area.
*  Nassau isolated several hundred houses, including on 1st Avenue where Huermann and his family
*  lived.
*  They provided short dossiers of each home.
*  Huermann, the source told me, was on that list.
*  Again, the police seemed to do nothing.
*  The FBI was as frustrated with the police as Seney was and threatened to leave the investigation.
*  Police leadership responded by pulling a long time lead detective off the Gilgokase.
*  It was taking time, but in certain ways, the law enforcement culture was changing.
*  Seney had some help from the police commissioner who succeeded him, Geraldine Hart, another outsider
*  who spent more than 20 years with the FBI.
*  Spired by the breakthrough in the Golden State Killer case in California, Hart commissioned
*  an outside lab that could use genetic genealogy, matching DNA evidence to genetic material collected
*  by private companies like 23 and me, to successfully identify a victim found during the Gilgokase
*  beach search in 2011 as Valerie Mack.
*  She disappeared in 2000, and, like the other four women, worked as an escort.
*  Hart also made public an intriguing piece of evidence that the police had not disclosed,
*  but leather belt with imprinted initials.
*  Hart said the police believed the killer had handled the belt.
*  Police are still trying to extract DNA from a hair that was found near the belt buckle.
*  There's always a risk when revealing sensitive information about a case.
*  It could tip their hand to the killer, for example, but enough time had passed.
*  The case was now convincingly alive again.
*  It took until 2022 for the Gilgokase to get what it needed all along, an interagency task
*  force with full-time investigators sharing information, resources, and ideas.
*  There's a certain poetry in the fact that the Suffolk District Attorney, who helped
*  make it happen, Ray Tierney had been pressured out of Spota's office in 2008.
*  Then a junior prosecutor, Tierney ran into trouble when he started questioning some corner
*  cutting in Spota's political corruption unit.
*  Quite abruptly, Tierney was transferred to rackets, throwing his future into jeopardy.
*  They took my car, they took the phone, Tierney told me recently.
*  I certainly got the message.
*  I said, my career in the DA's office is effectively over.
*  I was way outside the circle of trust.
*  Tierney left that office, but he never stopped working as a prosecutor, first in the US
*  attorney's office on Long Island, and then under Eric Gonzalez, the Brooklyn District
*  Attorney.
*  In both jobs, Tierney mounted cases against violent gangs that relied heavily on cell tower
*  data.
*  Like Seany, Tierney understood that when witnesses aren't helpful, the data is essential.
*  During the 13 years that he was outside Suffolk's closed universe, he heard plenty about the
*  troubles in the Burke era, and he never stopped watching to see if there was a break in the
*  Gilgo case.
*  In 2021, when he ran for Suffolk County District Attorney, Tierney made cracking the Gilgo case
*  part of his platform.
*  While campaigning, Tierney met with some of the Gilgo victims' family members face to
*  face, watching their expressions harden as they talked about the decade of frustration.
*  At that moment, Tierney found himself trying not to make promises he was not sure he could
*  keep.
*  I didn't know if it would be possible to solve, he told me.
*  After all this time, it still seemed like a needle in a haystack.
*  And if the killer was from Long Island and commuted to New York, did that really narrow
*  things down?
*  I grew up in KOMAC, Tierney told me, everybody who lived in KOMAC, you either own your own
*  business or you were a cop or fireman, or your dad or your mom or both of them got on
*  the train, went into the city and came home.
*  How many other people do that?
*  Soon after Tierney won the election, Rodney Harrison became the new police commissioner.
*  He had spent 12 years in investigations for the NYPD and worked a number of gang cases
*  with Tierney.
*  Harrison told Tierney that he wanted a task force, this time not just with the FBI, but
*  with everyone.
*  NASA County police officers, state police officers and the local sheriff's office all in a room
*  working daily and talking constantly.
*  Tierney had been saying the same thing on the campaign trail.
*  It seemed strange to each of them that nothing quite like this had happened before.
*  In his first days as commissioner, Harrison visited the site on Ocean Parkway, met with
*  the detectives and held a news conference saying he liked his chances.
*  Privately though, Harrison was shocked to see that after 10 years, the mountains of witness
*  statements, interview transcripts and investigation notes had never been digitized.
*  All the work Suffolk detectives had done on the case was unsurczable, accessible only
*  to a few detectives who were relying on their own limited memories of the case.
*  We had to collect everything and send it down to Quantico.
*  Harrison told me, so that was big.
*  They didn't even know what they had.
*  The task force was announced on February 15, 2022.
*  On March 14, they learned about the Chevy Avalanche.
*  It was simply a matter of which search tool they used.
*  In the early days of the investigation, the DMV record search used by Suffolk detectives
*  to find the Avalanche came up short.
*  But in 2022, a member of the new task force from the state police used a service called
*  TLOXP, a private subscription-based database that accesses more records in more places
*  all around the country.
*  The database was available in 2011 when the police first learned about the Avalanche.
*  This search had none of the filing issues of the previous search.
*  A car turned up right away.
*  An Avalanche owned by Hewerman at the time the bodies were first found.
*  This then, the ownership had transferred to Hewerman's brother Craig in South Carolina.
*  The state police were the game changers.
*  Harrison told me, they had never been part of the investigation.
*  Once we brought them to the table, they made the difference.
*  As soon as they saw a car record linked to Rex Hewerman, a man the size of an ogre
*  living and working in the exact geographic area that the data had been suggesting and
*  re-suggesting for ten years, the team locked in on him as a potential suspect.
*  There was even an archived Google Map photo from November 2011 showing a Chevy Avalanche
*  parked outside Hewerman's house in Massa Peak, Wapark.
*  From much of 2022, the task force used cell tower data furnished by the FBI and refined
*  by Sini to match Hewerman's movements to the movements of the victims and the killer.
*  Tierney's office filed about 300 subpoenas and search warrants.
*  Sure enough, wherever Hewerman's personal cell phone went, the burner phones attributed
*  to the killer seemed to follow.
*  None of this explained how a married father of two in a densely populated neighborhood
*  might operate unnoticed.
*  But then they used more conventional web searches to piece together Hewerman's life and the
*  life of his family.
*  When Megan Waterman disappeared, Hewerman's wife, Asa Ellorup, was away in the middle of
*  a four-day trip to Maryland.
*  When Amber Castello vanished, Ellorup was spending a week away from home in New Jersey.
*  And in the summer of 2009, two days before Melissa Bartholomey disappeared, Hewerman's
*  wife left the United States on a trip to Iceland.
*  She was not in town when Bartholomey vanished, nor was she in town a few days later when
*  Bartholomey's sister Amanda started getting harassing calls from a man using Melissa's
*  phone.
*  Hewerman did appear to be in town, then, but he left for Iceland several days later,
*  and for the length of his time out of the country, Amanda received no calls from her sister's
*  phone.
*  Those calls resumed the day after Hewerman came home.
*  Scouring Hewerman's email, the police found accounts for burner phones.
*  None were the ones connected to the women's disappearances, but with one of those burners,
*  they found something significant.
*  An email account he used to conduct Google searches.
*  The content of these searches was everything the police had hoped and dreaded it to be.
*  He was interested in violent porn, he was interested in child porn.
*  He wanted to know what this new Gilgotezk force was up to, and from other record searches,
*  they learned he was using Tinder and contacting escorts, and he had guns, lots and lots of
*  guns.
*  With this new insight into Hewerman, Harrison knew the clock was ticking, who's to say
*  if he'd already heard other people or was about to.
*  From there, Harrison said his thoughts turned even darker.
*  All those gun permits, 97 of them?
*  How would someone with that many guns react if he knew he was being investigated?
*  What would a person like that do if someone tried to arrest him?
*  Honestly, I was nervous, Harrison told me.
*  What's his mindset?
*  Is he somebody unstable that can do a mass shooting incident or something like that?
*  You know your mind starts racing all over.
*  They needed DNA to confirm everything else they had found, including the hairs on the
*  tape used to bind the bodies.
*  Tailing Hewerman, they picked their sample from a pizza box he tossed into a garbage can
*  on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.
*  One more indelible image to make this case notorious, like the burlap and the bramble.
*  The hair follicles from the tape contained trace genetic samples requiring a special process
*  called mitochondrial analysis.
*  The FBI matched Hewerman's DNA to one hair.
*  Two other hairs matched Hewerman's wife, whose DNA the police found on two bottles left
*  outside their home.
*  The theory is that Hewerman used a role of tape that had been lying around the house.
*  On Thursday, July 15th, a group of officers approached Hewerman as he was walking along
*  Fifth Avenue near his office.
*  As one stopped him, the others formed a circle tightening around him.
*  There was not a hint of violence and arrest so smooth that pedestrians kept on walking
*  past them.
*  After all this time, the police had a win.
*  They built their case, found a plausible suspect, and apprehended him without bloodshed.
*  Tierney and Harrison held a news conference with the victim's families squarely behind
*  them, another change from the old days when the families were told to keep their distance.
*  But this is Suffolk County, and so that same day Steve Bologna, whose term as County
*  executive ends this year and whose legacy will be forever entangled with the burks Spota
*  era, held his own news conference.
*  The governor, Kathy Hocal, made her remarks separately too during an unrelated media event
*  at Jones Beach.
*  They weren't invited to Tierney and Harrison's news conference, Tierney said later, because
*  this wasn't about politics.
*  Hewerman has been charged in the murders of three of the four women, Waterman, Artholomei
*  and Costello, and remains a prime suspect in the murder of Brainerd Barnes.
*  He has pleaded not guilty.
*  There are six more sets of remains with no suspects attached, not counting Shannon
*  Gilbert, whose body was found at the end of 2011, and whose death police continue to maintain
*  was unrelated, a cruel, coincidental tragedy that set this case in motion.
*  While Joel Rifkin, a prolific Long Island serial killer of an earlier era, confessed
*  right away to 17 murders, Hewerman is maintaining his innocence, and for the time being,
*  his silence.
*  During the 13 years this case went without an arrest, what chance would there be that the
*  killer never tried something else like it?
*  Would someone like him just stop at four?
*  Tierney has seen all the suspect's web searches and has his own assessment of the man.
*  I would say that the interest and the obsession never left, he said.
*  He has announced he will try the case against Hewerman personally, a district attorney
*  going into court to argue before a jury, the most notorious serial killer trial intergeneration.
*  All eyes will be on Suffolk County again.
*  What happens next is a chance to make up at least partly for the years when this case
*  was in such disarray, and Suffolk County's law enforcement culture seemed all too willing
*  to forget it ever happened.
