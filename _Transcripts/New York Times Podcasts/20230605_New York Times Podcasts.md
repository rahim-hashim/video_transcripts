# The New Afghanistan, Through the Eyes of Three Women

*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernu-C, and this is the Daily.
*  In the two years since the U.S. pulled out of Afghanistan, what was feared has now come
*  to pass.
*  The Taliban has shut women and girls out of public life.
*  My colleague Christina Goldbaum traveled across Afghanistan to talk to women about how they're
*  managing these changes.
*  What she found is not what she expected.
*  Today she brings us the stories of three women.
*  It's Monday, June 5th.
*  So Christina, the last time we talked about Afghanistan on the show was last summer.
*  And at the time, the Taliban had banned young women from high school.
*  You went to Afghanistan earlier this year on a reporting trip.
*  Catch us up in what's been going on.
*  Sure.
*  So remember, after the Taliban seized power in August 2021, there were a lot of questions
*  around just how far the Taliban would go in their treatment of women and girls.
*  And in that time, we saw the government begin to roll back some rights.
*  What we've seen in more recent months is the Taliban administration introducing more
*  and more restrictive policies that in a lot of ways have just erased women and girls from
*  public life.
*  Well, Afghanistan's Taliban rulers have imposed yet another restriction on women.
*  Last November, they banned women completely from public places like parks and gyms.
*  The Ministry of Virtue and Vice says the ban is being introduced because people were
*  ignoring gender segregation rules and women were not wearing the hijab.
*  And then in December, tears in the classroom as female students realized the Taliban abanning
*  them from university.
*  They expanded their education restrictions and banned women from attending universities.
*  Effectively banning women and girls from middle school through college.
*  And then soon after that, they introduced another ban.
*  You have some big aid groups now stopping operations in Afghanistan that prevented women
*  from working in international NGOs.
*  Any such group that continues to employ women will lose its license according to the economic
*  ministry.
*  And then a couple of months later, barred them also from working at all UN agencies in
*  Afghanistan.
*  What we're really seeing now is how the Taliban's treatment of women is setting the country
*  on course for complete isolation on the world stage.
*  These policies have been pretty much universally condemned, including by other Islamic governments
*  like Saudi Arabia and Iran.
*  And a few months ago, the UN also released a report saying that the regime's policies
*  towards women were a chance amount to gender apartheid.
*  So this has just been a relentless crackdown and it's now gotten even worse.
*  Women have lost pretty much every freedom in Afghan society.
*  And everyone can see it.
*  So what did you go there to do?
*  What were you curious about?
*  Yeah, so the latest restrictions really felt like a turning point for women's rights under
*  the Taliban.
*  But it often feels nowadays like almost every door has been closed to women in the country.
*  But I knew that in response to these policies, the women whose reactions we tend to hear the
*  most, the ones that are most amplified, tend to be women who are in Kabul, you know, educated,
*  English speakers.
*  But that's really only a small subset of the women who are in the country.
*  So on this trip, I wanted to speak to other women from other parts of the country to get
*  a more nuanced picture.
*  So a few colleagues and I traveled across the country to speak to women of all walks
*  of life and try to understand how they were experiencing all of the changes over the
*  last several months.
*  So where did your journey start?
*  So the first stop in our journey was in Wordak province.
*  It's around 12 o'clock.
*  We've just spent the last hour so driving through these kind of winding roads in Central
*  Afghanistan.
*  It's a province that's just west of Kabul and it's a very rural area.
*  Everything around here, the mud brick homes here, they're all this kind of ash and gray
*  color and the village is kind of nestled in the foothills of these mountains and overlooks
*  this valley.
*  The area we went to is called the Tangi Valley and it's a pretty conservative place that
*  has had pretty strong ties to this government.
*  The valley actually became known for the pretty large number of US troops that were killed
*  here.
*  The province is home mostly to Pashtuns so that's the main ethnic group of the Taliban.
*  And so given how intensely this area had experienced the violence during the war.
*  So we're walking down this very narrow kind of AC pathway.
*  I wanted to understand what this new era was like for women there.
*  And we're going to the home of a woman and we're going to go talk to her about her
*  she's.
*  So I got into this village.
*  And I met with a woman named Aisha.
*  And she lives in this small brick home that's on the foothills of the mountain overlooking
*  the valley.
*  She has this really kind of wrinkled face and is sort of short and kind of shuffles about
*  to get around the house.
*  She told me that she was around 65 or 70 years old.
*  She doesn't know her exact age because they didn't keep any kind of formal records.
*  And we sat down on this dusty wool carpet on the floor with a few other elders from
*  the village and a couple of her grandchildren who were kind of running in and out of the
*  room.
*  And she started to tell me about her life.
*  And where is she going?
*  Where is she going?
*  I'm going to go back to the village.
*  She said that she grew up in rural Wartac and she grew up pretty poor.
*  And I asked her if she ever went to school and she said that she didn't.
*  There wasn't even a girl's primary school where she grew up.
*  There was a school for boys but girls weren't allowed to go.
*  And then when she was around 16 years old, her father told her that she had to marry
*  a man in an neighboring village.
*  And shortly after she got married, her first husband died and then she got remarried
*  to somebody else in Tengi Valley and they started a family.
*  And she had three sons and four daughters.
*  They had a small plot of land where they grew beans and wheat and they never had very
*  much but they had at least enough to get by.
*  And then the war started.
*  And she told me about how she remembers American tanks rolling through the village.
*  And at that point initially, she felt kind of hopeful that maybe the US was there to help
*  improve conditions in this community.
*  And then pretty quickly she realized that that wouldn't be the case.
*  As the years progressed, there was a lot of homegrown support in this area for the Taliban
*  and in her village.
*  A lot of young men joined the movement.
*  A lot of families provided support.
*  And that meant that the fighting there became pretty intense.
*  The way that she put it was that when they would leave the house, death was their companion.
*  It happened that frequently that people were killed.
*  And it got so bad that at one point they even moved to a different village trying to get
*  away from the fighting.
*  But it wasn't long until the devastation reached her home too.
*  She told me about one night about a decade ago.
*  And she and her family went to a wedding in a village nearby.
*  And after the celebration, her second oldest son, Shereen, stayed in the house where the
*  wedding took place.
*  He was going to spend the night there with a few people he knew, including some talent fighters.
*  And while we can't know for sure, she insisted to me that her son was not a member of the
*  Taliban.
*  And that night the house was hit in what she said was an air strike and her son was killed.
*  Oh man, how old was her son?
*  22 years old.
*  She said that from that moment forward, she decided that she wasn't going to help or
*  corroborate with either side of this war.
*  She wouldn't help the Taliban.
*  She would not help the Americans.
*  She said that she hated all soldiers.
*  She hated this war.
*  But it just kept taking from her.
*  She was like, she didn't know.
*  That's not true.
*  She's coming.
*  Yeah, and show us exactly what happened.
*  She told me that story.
*  She led me just outside the front door of her house.
*  To explain the second tragedy that happened to her and her family.
*  It was a few years later after her son's Shereen was killed.
*  She was walking back from another wedding with her oldest son Farouk and his kids and his
*  wife.
*  And she said at this point, she was so used to the war that she used to carry a flashlight
*  and point it at herself so that anyone who was watching would know that she was a woman.
*  She wasn't a combatant.
*  She wasn't a soldier.
*  And this night it was laid it was around 930.
*  And she heard this gunshot.
*  And then she heard her son let out a sound.
*  And she turned around and she pointed her flashlight at him.
*  And she saw him kind of stumble a few steps back and fall to the ground.
*  Where was the checkfast?
*  On the top of the hill.
*  On the top of that hill.
*  Yeah.
*  She said he had been shot by an American-backed Afghan forces.
*  So she ran up to him.
*  And she still remembers kind of leaning over him.
*  And when he was on the ground there, she grabbed onto his hand.
*  She put his hand on her leg and taking his hand in her lap and having it there as he
*  died.
*  We, after that show, I said don't walk me on this path.
*  God's our second son.
*  Yeah.
*  So when she comes out her friend through, she sees the tomb of her youngest son.
*  And when she goes out the back door, she sees the tomb of her eldest son.
*  Oh my God.
*  So you can imagine that the tomb of her son is a tomb of her son.
*  So you can imagine that when the Taliban seized power and took over Kabul, there were celebrations
*  in her village.
*  She remembers crying from happiness that this war was finally over.
*  And she said that now she feels the sense of peace and of security.
*  She can travel and see relatives that she hadn't seen for years.
*  She can leave her house comfortably.
*  And nowadays she was saying that when she goes to the market or when she goes to the river
*  to wash her clothes, she's not anxious about, am I going to make it home alive?
*  And how now that the war is over, she has this kind of newfound freedom.
*  So normal life has come back, which is a huge relief.
*  But what about all the changes the Taliban's made since they took over?
*  What did she say about that?
*  Well, she did acknowledge that in a lot of ways her life has gotten more difficult now.
*  With the economic collapse after the Taliban seized power, her family is really only scraping
*  to get by.
*  There isn't much work for her one surviving son.
*  Sometimes they don't have any food to eat for dinner besides bread and tea.
*  And when I asked her what she thought about the government's restrictions specifically
*  on women, she said that she disagrees with them.
*  She thinks that women should get an education.
*  She thinks that even if a woman's main role in Afghanistan is leading her family, that
*  she will do that better if she's educated.
*  And at one point, she kind of pointed to her granddaughter who was sitting right beside
*  her with her head and her lap.
*  And she said that she's afraid that her granddaughter will grow up and just like her be uneducated,
*  be a literate, she won't have a brighter future.
*  But for her, after what she experienced over the 20 years of war, the loss that she experienced,
*  the violence that her family experienced, for her the idea of an education for girls
*  is seen as kind of a luxury.
*  But something that to her is less important than just staying alive and surviving.
*  So Aisha is basically saying here that she's willing to tolerate these really extreme
*  policies against women and girls, if ultimately it means being safe, which is just a really
*  practical, human response to the violence of war.
*  It is.
*  And she even told me that she would be happy dying from hunger that night as long as it
*  meant that the war did not return.
*  You know, those are the standards by which she's judging this government and the policies
*  that it's implementing.
*  But women in another province we went to nearby felt very differently.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Christina, tell me about the next province you went to.
*  What happened there?
*  So it's around 10.30 a.m. and we're in Bamyon.
*  So a few weeks later I went to Bamyon.
*  It's the province just west of Wardak.
*  And this area is home mostly to Hisaras.
*  It's an ethnic minority in Afghanistan, they're Shia, not Sunni, like Taliban.
*  And the group has historically faced a lot of persecution in the country.
*  So very different from Aisha and her community in Wardak.
*  Exactly.
*  And the Taliban first came to power in the 90s.
*  A lot of people here were killed at that time.
*  And then after the Taliban's first government was toppled, Hisaras across Afghanistan benefited
*  a lot from the US intervention.
*  They went to universities, got degrees.
*  It was like 180.
*  You know, things kind of completely changed.
*  And so when the Taliban seized power again, there was a lot of fear about what this chapter
*  in Afghanistan's history would mean for them.
*  We're here to meet a woman who's continuing to teach girls who are in high school.
*  So I've got a face mask on.
*  We're trying to go a little bit low profile.
*  And one reason I wanted to go there in particular is because we had been talking to this teacher
*  turned activist who was running a secret school for girls in Bamyun.
*  A secret school?
*  Yes, an underground school.
*  We're in now this kind of neighborhood that's kind of tucked away into the mountain side.
*  We're just trying to figure out where exactly it is.
*  And eventually we got to this house that looked like any other.
*  And we walked in.
*  Stop, Jeze.
*  And inside it, there were these three rooms that had been transformed into three small classrooms.
*  And we went into one and there were a few dozen girls who were high school age.
*  And they were sitting on these rickety wooden benches in a physics class with this whiteboard
*  in front of them.
*  Most of them had winter coat songs.
*  They were still pretty cold and the room wasn't heated.
*  And they were all sitting there with these kind of old torn notebooks and pencils in hand.
*  So this may look like an ordinary classroom, but actually it's a very feisty act of resistance.
*  It is.
*  I mean, that says a hugely risky undertaking that these students and these teachers have at the school.
*  But I was looking at this teacher in the front of the room and she was as confident as ever.
*  You would think that nothing they were doing was illegal.
*  And after the class let out, we sat down with her to talk about the school and her students.
*  So tell me about her.
*  Are we starting with Hamida?
*  How old are you Hamida?
*  Chancen, Salas and the social media.
*  It's nice son.
*  25.
*  Yeah.
*  So her name is Hamida.
*  She's 25 years old.
*  She had this dark, alburn hair that was falling out from behind her headscarf.
*  And she was explaining to me that she used to teach at a private school in Bamyan.
*  And she really loved it.
*  But then there was one moment about six months after the Taliban seized power when things suddenly changed for her.
*  She said that there were some local Taliban officials who had asked a handful of women to put out the word
*  that there would be this large gathering like a workshop about supporting women and children.
*  And she said that it felt like every woman from the city came to this meeting.
*  But when they got there, they started to think that they were actually being duped.
*  But they were like, what do you think?
*  There were these posters on the back of the wall that were kind of pro-Taliban.
*  And they thought it looked like local Taliban officials wanted to use the gathering kind of like a photo op
*  to take a picture and say, look at all these women who gathered here to support this new government.
*  So not in fact a workshop to help women at all, but just something for their own PR.
*  Exactly.
*  And the minute that Hamidah realized that, she became furious.
*  And she went to the back of the room and she ripped down one of those posters.
*  And then she gave this fiery speech about how she didn't think the Taliban represented them.
*  And she wouldn't be here to stand for this.
*  Wow, it's pretty brave.
*  Yeah, and there was a video of that that kind of made the rounds on social media.
*  I mean, you can just imagine how bold a move that is.
*  This is a government that has arrested and detained protesters and dissidents.
*  It's a huge risk.
*  And so basically from that point forward, she felt like she had this target on her back.
*  She said that a few local Taliban officials showed up at the school where she was working.
*  And so she had to quit because she was worried about her security there.
*  She pretty much went into hiding.
*  She stopped living in her family's house and started living with a friend.
*  She never really left the house.
*  And she described this moment as being this kind of dark period because it just went against
*  every instinct she had at her body to not be speaking out or doing something.
*  And just be staying at home.
*  And so when she started to see what was happening with all these restrictions a couple months later,
*  she basically said enough is enough.
*  She gathered a few other teachers she knew in the fall of last year.
*  And they decided to start this underground school for girls.
*  So how does she go about doing that?
*  Like what does she do?
*  So one of these teachers offered up her house and said they could use that for the classrooms.
*  And they took some like chairs and benches that that teacher wants to use at a private school.
*  She worked at and brought them into the house.
*  And they pulled money together to buy whiteboards and pens.
*  And then they went for about a week straight to street door to door in our neighborhood.
*  Telling families that they were going to open the school and trying to convince them that
*  they should send their girls.
*  And what would the families say?
*  I mean, what was the response?
*  I mean, a lot of parents were understandably afraid.
*  But on the other hand, they were also really eager to have their daughters go back to school
*  because they had been sitting at home pretty isolated and bored and depressed for months.
*  And a lot of them also just really wanted their daughters to retain all the progress
*  they had made in school up until that point.
*  And the first day they had about 50 students show up.
*  And then by the end of their first week, that number had shot up to 150 girls
*  who were all there sitting in classes.
*  Wow.
*  Every family contributes whatever they can.
*  The community offers up donations for supplies.
*  And Hamida also said that she and other teachers prepared as best they could to keep this thing
*  underground.
*  They have students come at slightly different times to kind of stagger their entrance and stagger
*  their exits.
*  Wow.
*  Only people in the neighborhood really know about the school and they'll keep an eye out too for anyone
*  who they think is maybe an intelligent officer.
*  It's really this whole community effort to keep this going and keep girls in the neighborhood
*  going to school.
*  And then we'll go to the school that we're going to keep.
*  I'm happy to be here.
*  I'm happy to be here.
*  I'm happy to be here.
*  I hope we can get a good rest.
*  So is Bamyan and the secret school an outlier?
*  Like, is this very unusual for Afghanistan?
*  So it's really not.
*  There are probably now hundreds of these kind of underground schools for girls
*  all across the country.
*  Hundreds, wow.
*  And not long ago, we visited a school in Kandahar, the southern hurtland of the Taliban.
*  And there was an underground school there that worked in pretty similar ways.
*  So really across the country, since high schools have closed, people have accepted that this is
*  the new reality, that they don't feel like there is really any chance that this government
*  under this leadership will reopen high schools.
*  They found these ways of continuing to get educated and continuing to cultivate these
*  seeds of hope for girls' futures.
*  But Christina, at the end of the day, for these girls, isn't it a dead end?
*  Okay, they can go to school in this secret school, but there won't be a college for them to go to,
*  and there won't be a job for them to go to.
*  That's true.
*  And you know, Hamida, these girls, they all recognize that.
*  But I think also what motivates her is knowing that in order for there to be any hope
*  that women win back their rights in Afghanistan, first, they need to be educated.
*  You know, Hamida and these girls want to prepare for whatever comes next,
*  because they hope they might be able to use this education and bring the country forward.
*  Right.
*  So Christina, you went to Wardak where you met Aisha, who feels
*  freer since the Taliban returned, and then you went to Bami'an and met Hamida, who feels the opposite.
*  Where did you go next?
*  So one of the most consequential restrictions of the Taliban introduced was the ban on women working
*  for aid groups and the UN, because so many people in the country rely on those groups to survive.
*  And then wanted to understand how that ban was affecting women who relied on aid every day.
*  So it's around 5 p.m.
*  We're on the outskirts of Harat, this big city in North Western, Afghanistan.
*  So we went to Harat, which is a city in the northwest part of the country.
*  It's along the border with Iran.
*  It's known for the kind of poetry and art that comes out of it.
*  But Harat's also surrounded by some of the country's poorest provinces.
*  There's Harat the south, which is pretty much just desert.
*  There's Gore into the east, which has historically been one of the poorest areas of Afghanistan,
*  and by deists to the north, which has been hit by drought for the last couple of years.
*  And so over the past couple of decades, Harat's become this kind of hub for people who were displaced
*  from their homes, and we're looking for aid, because a lot of the big aid groups have bases in
*  that city. And we're in the settlement, that's on just the outskirts of the city, where a lot of
*  those families have come in recent years, and we're here to meet. And we went to one of those camps
*  where there are about 600 families living, and we're here to meet with the swimmin Jamila,
*  who's 27 and she's a widow, and she's helped organize a lot of the aid that's come in here.
*  And that's where I met this woman named Jamila.
*  She moved the camp around five years ago after her husband died, and it was a really rough time,
*  because her husband, who was a day laborer, was the breadwinner for her and her children.
*  And she thought, okay, maybe if I move to Harat, one of these camps, that she'd be closer to some
*  of the aid organizations that would be able to help her family. And to an extent that plan kind of
*  worked.
*  She said that they got food aid from groups like the World Food Program, and over time,
*  she kind of became a fixer of sorts for aid groups working in the camp.
*  So if they were going to do a food distribution on a particular day, they would call her up,
*  and she would get the word out to people that they needed to be at this particular place, at this
*  particular time. If other women in the camp needed anything, they would go to her, and then she had
*  the number for people to call to say, hey, we need some more flour, we need some more oil, we need
*  medical help. And ultimately, over the last five years, that aid is what helped her family survive.
*  And for a while, she was even hopeful that if things continued, in that way that she'd be
*  able to send her kids to school, and she had this kind of hope.
*  But then the Taliban seized power. About a year later, they banned women from working in these
*  aid organizations, and it suddenly became a lot harder for women to access aid. And why was that?
*  So there are two parts to that.
*  For one, even before the Taliban came to power, in many parts of the country, women, especially
*  in rural areas, typically don't interact with men outside their families. And so by banning
*  women from working for aid groups, it effectively cut women off from being able to directly access
*  aid distribution. And the second thing is that in response to the initial ban, some of the major
*  aid organizations also suspended their operations entirely while they tried to figure out what to do.
*  Okay, so it's not just the Taliban banning women from these aid groups, it's the aid groups
*  themselves, their response to what the Taliban did that's also making women's lives more difficult.
*  In other words, doubly bad for someone like Jamila. Exactly.
*  Practically what it's meant for Jamila is that on the one hand, some organizations aren't working
*  anymore. So this lifeline she had, people she could call and get help, suddenly they're telling her,
*  you know, sorry, our operations have been suspended. We can't come deliver you a food personal.
*  And on the other hand, the aid organizations that are still working, many of them are only using
*  for say food distribution. And because Jamila is a widow, she doesn't have a husband, she could
*  stand in her place. So what this means pretty much is that she's kind of lost access to the
*  steady stream of food that she once had.
*  So this just sounds like a pretty dire situation for her. How is her family surviving at this point?
*  So for now she's surviving on the little money she's making from kind of creating these
*  handicrafts, but the wall and harvesting saffron during the saffron season, people in the camp give
*  her what they can to try to help, but it's incredibly difficult.
*  And she really worries now about her children's feature because she doesn't have food for them
*  on a day-to-day basis. And then she also knows that she probably won't be able to send them to school
*  because they're going to have to start earning money as young as they can in order to help the
*  families survive. And she's especially worried that if things continue like this for a long time,
*  she'll have to marry off her very young daughter in a couple of years or promise her for marriage
*  in order to get the dowry money from the groom's family. So selling off her own daughter to buy food?
*  Yeah, I mean it's a devastating prospect. It's one that a lot of women across that
*  can I say now we're faced with?
*  Can I be a join?
*  And you know she told me that right now she just feels totally hopeless. She said when she was
*  younger she used to have this hope that one day she would live a better life.
*  She told me that she'll take the dream of a better life with her to her grave.
*  You know that is how she feels about the current situation.
*  Yeah, she is single-mindedly focused on basic survival and what her story does really show is that
*  the world hasn't figured out how to help women in this gender apartheid state.
*  Exactly. I mean what Jamila is living through now just really epitomizes that dilemma, right?
*  How does the world interact with and respond to the Taliban?
*  And when I asked her about you know what she thought of all of this,
*  she said she felt like women were suffering from both sides of this equation.
*  On the one hand the Taliban's policies have been so restrictive towards women
*  that they don't have any opportunities to go to school or get jobs and pay for food for their
*  own families. So that's what she was saying to the Taliban. What would she say to the NGOs who are
*  saying we'll just leave.
*  And on the other side of it she said that if she could talk to the heads of these international
*  organizations she would say look at how my family is suffering.
*  Do you want a movie?
*  And to be fair these organizations are in a kind of impossible situation. I mean they're faced
*  with this choice between either delivering life-saving aid that may not reach women at all
*  if they're only using men to deliver it or upholding these principles of gender equality
*  that are at the core of a lot of their missions. It's an incredibly tough spot to be in.
*  But in the meantime as the rest of the world tries to figure out what to do ordinary Afghans in the
*  country you're suffering.
*  So stepping back here Christina you traveled all over Afghanistan far from Kabul,
*  heard all of these perspectives from women in different places in the country. Fundamentally
*  what did you take away from your trip and from all those conversations?
*  So I knew going into this that it had become pretty clear that the Taliban government
*  under this leadership with its current amir is determined to roll back the clock on women's rights.
*  You know his vision for women in the country is much like it was in the 90s that hasn't changed.
*  Another thing that hasn't changed is that the international community, especially the West,
*  is really struggling to create any kind of coherent policies towards Afghanistan.
*  But one thing I was surprised by was just how much women had changed in such different parts
*  of the country over the last 20 years. And you can really hear that in the stories of these women.
*  You know Jamila only has an elementary school education and yet she was sitting and talking to me
*  so in depth against the Taliban's recent policies. Hamida is from Bamyan, a place that has a terrifying
*  devastating history with the Taliban and yet she is defying the Taliban's edicts day in and day out
*  and great risk to herself. An Aisha is a grandmother from a Taliban stronghold who never got an
*  education herself and yet even though she prefers life under the Taliban, she is still advocating
*  for her granddaughter to go to high school. I mean all of that is pretty incredible and it shows how
*  while it might be easy for this government to enact these restrictive policies, it's going to take
*  a lot longer and be a lot harder for them to weed out these values that have taken root across
*  the country over the last 20 years.
*  And Hamida in particular spoke to me really powerfully about that but she also offered a kind of
*  warning. She said that right now women have this window where they can maintain some of the gains
*  they've made in the last 20 years but she worries about what happens in five or 10 or 15 years down
*  the line if things continue the way that they are now. The way that she put it it really sounds like
*  the situation is like a race against time. A race against time because right now many women and
*  girls remember what it was like during the generation that women did have freedoms and that did change
*  things. Exactly. You know she said if young girls today, unlike their moms and their older sisters,
*  if they don't see girls going to school, if they don't see women with any kind of power in society,
*  then that's it. All of those gains will be lost.
*  Christina thank you. Thanks so much for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. And now a bipartisan budget agreement.
*  President Biden signed the Fiscal Responsibility Act into law on Saturday,
*  ending the threat of economic calamity from a debt default just two days before the government
*  was set to run out of cash to pay its bills. Passing this budget agreement was critical.
*  The stakes could not have been higher. In remarks to the nation from the Oval Office on Friday night,
*  Biden praised the bipartisanship that led to the deal. And it's very good news for American people.
*  No one got everything they wanted but the American people got what they needed.
*  And a train crash in eastern India on Friday left 275 people dead, marking one of the deadliest
*  crashes in India's history. Officials investigating the crash are focusing on the possibility
*  that a signal failure caused the disaster. The crash has cast a call over Prime Minister Narendra
*  Modi's efforts to modernize India's infrastructure, which he's made a central theme in his campaign
*  for a third term. Today's episode was produced by Oslo Chathuravati and Claire Tennis Sketter,
*  with help from Eric Kruppi and Nina Feldman. It was edited by Anita Batajo,
*  contains original music by Maryano Luzano, Dan Powell, and Diane Wong, and was engineered by Chris Wood.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Lansford of Wonderly. Special thanks to Susan Lee,

*  That's it for the Daily. I'm Sabrina Tevernici. See you tomorrow.
