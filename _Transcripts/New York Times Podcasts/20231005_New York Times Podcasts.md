*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Barrow. This is Adelaide.
*  For decades, the world seemed to be winning the war against mosquitoes and the deadly diseases
*  that they carry. Now, we're once again losing that battle.
*  Today, my colleague Stephanie Nolan explains why.
*  It's Thursday, October 5.
*  Stephanie, you have embarked on an entire line of coverage for the times about mosquitoes.
*  Why? Why mosquitoes? And why now?
*  So, I went into this really thinking about solutions. I was going to do some nerdy geeky stories
*  because I knew there was some great new technology coming to fight mosquitoes.
*  And, you know, there are biggest enemies, right? They're the deadliest animal.
*  What does it explain now? They're the deadliest animal.
*  So, they kill more humans than anything else than any other living creature.
*  Because of the diseases that they carry.
*  Because of the diseases they carry. Exactly.
*  There's West Nile, there's Dingay, there's Malaria.
*  So, I went into this planning to look at solutions.
*  And really quickly, I realized that I hadn't really kept up with the scale of the problem.
*  That's, yes, we have new tools, but we need them because the problem has really gotten away from us.
*  And I covered public health, global public health for a living.
*  But I hadn't realized how much the kind of tide in this battle had shifted
*  that the mosquitoes were winning. And winning how?
*  They're winning in terms of our ability to control mosquito-borne disease.
*  And the place where you see that the most strikingly, I think, is with Malaria, with Malaria in Africa.
*  We were doing a really good job of bringing down Malaria deaths and that progress has stopped.
*  That is genuinely surprising to me because I think of Malaria as a disease that we have mostly
*  gotten under control. So, lay out for us exactly what happened and why that progress has stopped.
*  So, if you go back, like, 20 years, almost a million people were dying in Malaria every year,
*  almost all of them in Africa. So, just to remind you, the way that Malaria spreads,
*  is you have a mosquito who bites a person who has the parasite. The parasite reproduces in the
*  gut of the mosquito. And then when it bites, the next person, that person gets infected.
*  And you have the cycles of sickness that go through families. And it can be deadly, of course,
*  especially for small children. But it's not just about death, right? It's horrible. You get fevers
*  that can be so severe, you get hallucinations, you get vomiting, you get this absolutely
*  debilitating fatigue. And you don't get it once, right? You can get it four or five times in a
*  really season. Wow. Kids are getting 10 cases in a year. And that takes like a huge toll on their
*  families. They're spending their money on medical bills and people can't go to work because they're
*  taking care of them. There's a huge economic cost. And so, for all of these reasons, in the late 1990s,
*  there's a decision by African governments, by some philanthropists and global public health organizations
*  to really make an effort to wipe malaria out in Africa.
*  We have first of all reaching out to other partners, making an alliance for rollback malaria.
*  And what does that look like? It's a big investment.
*  Microsoft founder Bill Gates is giving up daily control of his company to concentrate on his
*  foundation, which funds health and education projects worldwide. A lot of that money comes from
*  philanthropy, from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, in particular who make eradicating malaria,
*  a huge priority. The fact that it kills over a million children a year and yet has almost no
*  money given to it, you know, that struck us as very strange, but it became a big deal. And the
*  decision is to try three strategies. We'll take the diseases of the poor, or there's no market,
*  and we'll get the best scientists working on those diseases. You're trying to find a solution.
*  One is better drugs, so there are new and better treatments for malaria, and there's a real
*  effort to get those into primary healthcare clinics across rural Africa. There were also new and
*  better insecticides, so in places with a heavy malaria burden, they would spray insecticides inside
*  people's homes, and they're long-acting, right? And so that would provide you with protection for a
*  while. And then the last one, bed nets. The thinking was that the main mosquitoes that transmit
*  malaria in Africa, they bite indoors and at night when people are asleep, and that's when people
*  are getting infected. And so you had this huge campaign to get an insecticide treated bed net
*  in every household on every family. Mothers were sent home from clinics with them with their new
*  babies, trucks would roll into villages and give them out. And so as these elements come together,
*  I'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria.
*  And how do these three solutions, including this quite low-tech bed net solution, actually work?
*  Well, it works really well. Devs come way down, cases come way down. By about 2015,
*  deaths bottom out at about 550,000 people, which obviously is still like a horrifying number of
*  people, but you've cut deaths in half, right? And people have really seen the difference in their
*  lives and the economic impact on their families. And so for a while there, as you're watching that
*  curve of infections come down, there's a belief that like, okay, if we keep investing on this and
*  we keep going, maybe we're going to get to elimination. So how do we get instead to where you say we
*  are, which is not elimination, but instead mosquitoes and malaria, resurgent and winning?
*  Well, so here's what I have found in my reporting after talking to dozens and dozens of
*  malariaologists, parasitologists, entomologists, all kinds of people who were working in this all over
*  Africa. The short answer is the mosquitoes adapted. Their lifespan might only be six or seven weeks,
*  and they evolve really, really quickly. So you get a lot of mutations within a mosquito, which means
*  that there's lots of opportunities for a mosquito to develop a way that it can survive what we're
*  throwing against it. And so really quickly, mosquitoes have outmaneuvered the solutions that we had in
*  place. And one of the big changes ties directly to bed nets. So if mosquitoes were not able to feed
*  at night, they weren't able to feed on sleepers who were under nets, some of those mosquitoes died out.
*  And there was an evolutionary advantage for those who started feeding at other times in other places.
*  And so now you have mosquitoes that are feeding outdoors, feeding during the daytime.
*  Obviously, people are not wandering around all day long wrapped in a bed net, right? So if you're not
*  protected anymore at the time when those mosquitoes are biting, suddenly you have cases starting to go
*  back up. And you know, that same evolutionary advantage issue comes up with the treatments, and it
*  comes up with the insecticides. Mosquitoes are resistant at this point to almost all of the chemicals,
*  all of the insecticides that are being used across Africa. They just don't kill them the way they did
*  20 years ago. So those three very effective solutions you mentioned that really brought down
*  death from malaria across Africa. They create the conditions in which these mosquitoes adapt and
*  adapt in ways that outsmart all three of these solutions. Yeah, exactly. And brace yourself for
*  this, Michael. It gets worse. So I'm reporting on all of this. And I call up a scientist at the CDC
*  who runs their entomology program. And she tells me, yes, these daytime biteers, these insecticide
*  resistant mosquitoes, it's all a really big problem. But also she says that I've missed something huge.
*  Which is what? Well, while the public health world has been focused on mosquitoes and the way
*  that they're adapting and how to respond to malaria in rural Africa, there's a whole new mosquito.
*  And it's an urban mosquito. It's highly adapted to live and thrive in cities.
*  So suddenly there's a kind of double whammy nightmare scenario being presented to you.
*  Yeah, not only are mosquitoes out adapting all the tools that we had for rural malaria,
*  now you have a mosquito that's bringing the disease into urban areas. And they're totally
*  unprepared to respond. We'll be right back. So Stephanie, tell us more about this second
*  threat, this mosquito that's now posing a risk to Africa's cities. So it's a mosquito called
*  anopheles. Well, here's where it gets tricky. It's called anopheles stevensae or anopheles
*  defenzy. And the entomologists I've interviewed are kind of split right down the middle about how
*  to pronounce it. And so in fact, a lot of them now just refer to her as Steve. Turns out these folks
*  have a pretty good sense of humor in the face of some pretty awful information. Yes, exactly.
*  And Steve, but we're using she, her because mosquitoes, of course, the ones that bite us are all
*  the females who are in search of blood for the protein to lay eggs. So Steve is,
*  she's kind of the superhero of mosquitoes. She's unbelievably adaptable. She's great at high
*  temperatures. She likes it when it's wet, but she's also fine when it's dry.
*  She'll breed all year round. So you're not talking about having a malaria season anymore,
*  like in a rainy season. Wow. And on top of all of that, she's what in the entomology world,
*  they call a very competent vector, which means she's really good at spreading the malaria apperacy.
*  It lives well inside her and it's very easy for her to pass it on to the next person she bites.
*  So perhaps not a superhero, but instead like a villain. Yeah.
*  Is this one of the mosquitoes, Stephanie, that we think evolved across rural Africa during this period
*  when bed nets and insecticides were being used and just has found her way into cities?
*  Great question, but no. Steve is an immigrant. She originates in South Asia in India and Pakistan,
*  unknown in Africa until way back in 2012. So in 2012, it was found in the tiny little country of
*  Djibouti on the horn of Africa. And the theory is that she was imported on containerships, maybe
*  in old car tires. And you know, initially nobody was overly concerned about this until all of a
*  sudden in Djibouti city, malaria cases started to creep up. And remember, malaria is not known as
*  an urban disease, right? Like we're talking about rural disease when we talk about malaria in Africa.
*  So it caused a lot of confusion like what exactly is going on in Djibouti? And then in 2022,
*  you get an outbreak of malaria in Ethiopia's second largest city, which is a place called Dira Dawa.
*  And it's got about a half a million people. And what happens is that a Dira Dawa university,
*  which ends up being the center of this outbreak, half of the students who live in the male dormitories
*  fall ill. The student clinic is overflowing with cases. At first, they don't know what's wrong
*  with these people. And then they start to realize that they've got malaria. And eventually more than
*  10,000 people are diagnosed with malaria in a city where like a half dozen people might get malaria
*  in the course of the year normal. Like they've just not seen anything like this before. Fascinating.
*  So it's very clearly the beginning of a new phase of Africa's relationship to malaria. And it
*  sounds like that is because of Steve. Yeah, exactly. And I wanted to see what does it look like when
*  Steven Zayn vades a city. Why is that potentially such a problem? And then I also wanted to see
*  what cities, what health systems are able to do if anything when they're trying to respond.
*  And you know, the Ethiopian government is not receptive to foreign journalists. And it took me
*  many, many months. But finally, back in May, I got to Dira Dawa. And I went to spend time with a
*  couple of scientists, a molecular biologist named Fitsum Tidesi and an entomologist named
*  DeGene Gattachu. And they've been studying Steven Zayn and this outbreak since the moment it started.
*  We'll tell us more about this trip. So I got to Dira Dawa and it's a very, very hot, very
*  arid city in a river valley. It's very close to the border with Djibouti and Somalia.
*  It's a very vibrant place, especially at night. It really comes alive at night because of the heat.
*  It has lots of little narrow streets and the houses are behind high walls.
*  This is very dense housing actually, it's all singing.
*  Little blue auto-victures zip around in the street and you get a living room,
*  really brightly colored hijab and robes.
*  And when I get there, basically the very first thing we do is we go to the place where
*  these scientists fit some in DeGene first found Steven Zayn.
*  Which is where? Okay, you've got the gear. I'm ready.
*  Well, it's along the banks and little pools that have been left along the sides of the bank of
*  the river that runs through Dira Dawa. I'm ready to meet my first Steven Zayn.
*  I love a little stagnant water. So we're standing in the shallow water on the edge of the river.
*  Dira Dawa, you're not going to have to go there.
*  Is this one? Yeah, it's moving. I can see them. Yeah.
*  And DeGene is scooping up water from these pools and puddles and looking at the larvae.
*  But you would say the chances are very high at Steven Zayn.
*  Very, very high.
*  And what he's trying to do when they collect samples in a place like this is figure out how much of
*  the mosquito population is actually Steve. And they started doing this next to the river when
*  the malaria outbreak began because a lot of the initial cases that were reported were in families
*  who lived near here and near the river. So we had 100 meter radius for the larvae.
*  100 meter radius of everywhere you found a case.
*  And what they do is they go to the home of everyone who's diagnosed with malaria and they
*  trap the mosquitoes in and around the house. So, low and behold, 97% of the mosquitoes they catch
*  are an awfully students eye. Wow, so this mosquito is clearly thriving, but is it
*  mostly contained to the river? No. So, in fact, they found Steve in a lot of other places that
*  are a lot less predictable than a river. The places this mosquito is turning up are really
*  surprising if you think about the ways that we traditionally think of mosquitoes in Africa behaving.
*  Steve is so adaptable that sure, she'll breed in these pools next to the river, but she'll also
*  breed in water tanks. And she can breed in the amount of water that you might find in an old bottle
*  cap. She will feed on humans, yes, but she'll also feed on livestock. And that's why actually
*  the next place that DeGene wanted to take me was into a goat shed. So, lots of families in DuraDua
*  have these little outbuildings in their homes where they keep a couple of goats or a couple of sheep,
*  maybe a cow. And it turns out that the mosquito will rest in there because it's cool and it's dark
*  and it's moist during the daytime when it's really hot. And there's also, of course, a very
*  accessible source of food, which is the goats. The goats. So, I'm falling along behind DeGene down
*  these narrow alleyways. And animal shed with a low roof. And the next thing you know, he's down
*  on his hands and knees, crawling into these little buildings. There may be like three or four if you
*  tall, if you're crammed full of goats. And he goes and you know, he wants to show me how this works.
*  So, in I go to... Okay, I am crawling into the goat shed. Here we go. I can see nothing. I'm going to
*  end up sitting on a goat. I'm too tall. I'm generally not made to be an entomologist.
*  And he gets on his phone and he uses the flashlight to run it sort of really quickly over the walls
*  and there were mosquitoes. What'd it be fine?
*  Fred Mosquito, you can tell from out here. All right, to Jenny is able in the dark, in the gloom,
*  with the goats to identify which mosquitoes they are. I can barely see them.
*  Sorry goats. Sorry. He's like totally unfazed by the goats. And when you see some mosquitoes,
*  what he does is he's got what's called an aspirator, which is like a little last tube with a piece
*  of rubber piping on the end. And he puts the rubber pipe in his mouth and he holds the end of a glass
*  tube up against the wall where he's seen a mosquito and he gently sucks it in. Got him.
*  So that it's alive but trapped. And what they do is, again, like take them back to the lab where
*  they can sort them properly and identify which species it is and then know whether he's finding
*  Steve in these places. This is an amazing thing to envision. Well, it's particularly amazing if
*  you think about doing it with like a large herd of goats. So we were also very interested in what's
*  happening and our fully attempting to participate. These goats are stiffing in me.
*  Excuse me pardon me. Okay. All right. All right.
*  I'm out. Okay.
*  So when DeGenerne had sucked all the visible mosquitoes off the walls, we crawled back out of the shed
*  and walking through more of these narrow streets. I can tell you like I'm looking at the place
*  on a whole new way now, right? And I'm just thinking there are so many places where Steve could be.
*  If you think that like she only needs small amounts of water to breed and she's happy with
*  artificial sources of water. She's happy in containers, in old plastic containers.
*  I'm looking around and I'm seeing puddles under cisterns and I'm seeing water storage containers
*  in front of people's houses. Duredella's municipal water only runs a couple of days a week.
*  So when it turns on, everybody fills up some barrels, some Jerry cans in front of their house and
*  keeps them nearby and they don't have reliable trash collection. So you'll get lots of these little
*  bits of plastic around that are a place for it to breed. And when we talk about Steven's I being
*  a threat across Africa, like that's one of the reasons why, right? Because these erratic municipal
*  services, it's a very common problem. So I'm looking around Duredella and I'm thinking,
*  Steve could be everywhere here and I'm thinking like the public health system is absolutely not in a
*  state to respond to this.
*  Well, what exactly is the public health infrastructure in the city like this that is now
*  dealing with Steve and with so much malaria?
*  So Ethiopia has really been investing in primary care in public health, but they don't have urban
*  malaria response, right? Remember, it hasn't been an urban disease. So there's no muscle memory in
*  the city for responding. People don't have immunity. They get very ill and clinics don't know what
*  they're looking at. I talked to a woman, a nurse who was pregnant when she got malaria, she got
*  incredibly sick, but it was 10 days and you know, a half dozen malaria tests before she got
*  if confirmed diagnosis because nobody was looking for it.
*  And this is a nurse who presumably has a lot of strong ties to the medical community.
*  Yeah, when you get a sudden severe malaria outbreak in a place that's not expecting it,
*  it can really quickly start to do real things, right? And if you think that there are 600
*  million people who live in cities in Africa, then that's so many people who are potentially vulnerable
*  to this mosquito. So when you start to put all of those things together, you get the scenario that
*  keeps Ethiopian scientists awake at night that's really terrifying that CDC scientists who first
*  told me about this. And somewhat counterintuitively, we think of cities as places that represent
*  progress and where healthcare is going to be better than in rural Africa. You're saying that
*  it's the opposite in this case, the treatment is worse and the opportunities for the mosquitoes to
*  grow are even greater. Yeah, look, I don't think it's hopeless, right? I don't think that there's
*  a reason why cities can't learn to respond to this, why people can't develop this expertise.
*  But it doesn't exist now. Let's turn to the question of solutions, which is definitely the thing
*  you set out to report on, are there any? And not just solutions to Steve and African cities,
*  but to the adaptations that are presenting such problems in rural Africa as well. What can African
*  governments do about this beyond what they've already done? So there are some new solutions,
*  and each one of them comes with some challenges. First of all, there are improvements on the things
*  we have. There are new classes of insecticides being brought to market, and those will hopefully kill
*  mosquitoes more effectively. There's also some really interesting new innovative technologies.
*  I went to Kenya to see a clinical trial of something called a spatial repellent, which is this
*  sheet of clear plastic. It's about the size of a piece of loose leaf, and it's soaked in a repellent
*  that confuses the mosquitoes, keeps them from being able to bite. So the early indications are,
*  the both of these things are working really well, but our mosquitoes all the time are adapting,
*  right? And so eventually you're going to run into this question of resistance again.
*  Right. All these things sound like they ultimately have a shelf life. They can't last all that long
*  given just how quickly mosquitoes evolve and adapt. Yeah. So that's why you need to come at us from
*  a couple of different directions, right? And that's one of the places where I would say there's a lot
*  of hope right now. There's a new malaria vaccine that's being rolled out in sub-Saharan Africa.
*  You give it to small children, and it should be able to provide them with a lot of protection
*  throughout their lives. But, you know, vaccines like we saw with COVID, they're challenging to
*  deliver, and they can be expensive. They're coming in at about $10 per child, which maybe doesn't
*  sound like so much. But if you think about the fact that, for example, Tanzania, their whole health
*  budget is $2 per person per year. So, to act against that, these vaccines are really going to cost
*  a lot. So the solution situation is not where anyone wants it to be. As you've been talking, Stephanie,
*  it's occurred to me that we've spent this whole conversation talking about Africa. But
*  Steve seemed to come from outside of Africa to Africa, and now as Africa's problem, I have to
*  assume that a fear might be that as malaria becomes a bigger and bigger crisis in Africa for all
*  the reasons we're talking about here, Africa could export its malaria problem to somewhere else in
*  the world. Is that what the scientists you talk to fear? You know, I think I would say it's not so much
*  about export. It's not about something that comes on a boat. It's actually, it's about something
*  much bigger than that. What we've been seeing with mosquito-borne disease in the last few years
*  is a really big impact from climate change. Lots of places are becoming a better environment
*  for mosquitoes that carry a lot of different diseases, not just malaria. I think what we're seeing
*  is that in a very quickly changing world, mosquitoes do better, move faster than we do. For me, that's
*  the lesson from Steve that I saw in Ethiopia. Not that Steve's going to leave Africa and come
*  to other parts of the world, invade other continents, but that the environmental issues that are
*  present in a place like Africa are present elsewhere. That's the problem. That's as humans, we create
*  lots of situations where mosquitoes can flourish. They look different in different places, cities and
*  towns, Africa versus Latin America, but what those places have in common is that mosquitoes are thriving
*  and posing a threat that we're not nearly quick enough in providing solutions for. Or it sounds like from
*  the case of Africa, prepared to deal with in real time. No, not yet.
*  I think for me, the lesson of what I saw in Daredawa, what's happened with Steve, is really just
*  how quickly things can go south. You can think that you don't have the problem or you can think that
*  you have the problem managed or that you have the tools you need. The way mosquitoes work,
*  incredibly quickly, you can find yourself with a public health crisis. I think as we think about
*  the spread of mosquitoes and the threat they pose, I think that should be alarming for everybody.
*  Stephanie, thank you very much. We appreciate it. That's a pleasure.
*  We'll be right back. Here's what else you need to
*  do.
*  On Wednesday, President Biden canceled $9 billion more in student loan debt just as requirements to
*  repay those loans, which have been paused for three years, have resumed. Biden's previous attempts
*  to forgive a far larger amount of student loans were struck down by the Supreme Court,
*  but the latest effort is a workaround that relies on a different law.
*  And more than 75,000 employees of the health care company Kaiser Permanente began a three-day strike
*  on Wednesday, becoming the latest group of unionized workers to walk off the job in the past few
*  months. The workers are demanding higher wages, which they say are necessary to end labor shortages
*  that have plagued the company for years. The strike is being closely watched because Kaiser Permanente's
*  health care plans cover 13 million Americans across eight states.
