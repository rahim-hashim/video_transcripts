# The Sunday Read: ‘The Inheritance Case That Could Unravel an Art Dynasty’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2BFqq3lMfk)
*  My name is Rachel Corbett. I'm a contributor to the New York Times magazine, and I've
*  written for a long time about the art world. It's a world of very little oversight and
*  transparency, where some of the greatest masterpieces in history are traded among the super wealthy
*  and then locked away in underground bunkers. Unless you're intimately familiar with this
*  world, you might not know there's one family that's cast a sort of shadow over the industry
*  for decades. Five generations of famously secretive figures who invented, in a way,
*  many of the systems by which the art market works to this day. This week's Sunday read is a story
*  I wrote for the magazine about that family, the Wildensteins of New York and France. It's a look
*  at how the art world can aid and abet taxi evasion and money laundering for very high net worth people.
*  Oligarchs, billionaires, and allegedly this one family, who have managed to accumulate enormous
*  wealth by quietly buying up huge swaths of masterpieces and holding them in tax havens.
*  Paintings by Monet, Cezanne, Gauguin, stashed away in freeports that look like prisons,
*  full of unimaginable amounts of art. This is a story of tax evasion on a billion dollar scale
*  potentially and it's culminating in an explosive trial this month before France's highest court.
*  So the Wildenstein dynasty of art dealers dates back to the 1870s, but this particular story
*  starts in 2001 with the death of Sylvia Wildenstein's husband, Daniel. Daniel, at this point in time,
*  is the patriarch of this empire and when he dies his two sons, Sylvia's step-sons, tell Sylvia that
*  actually he died in ruin and she was going to be financially ruined too unless she renounced her
*  inheritance. Sylvia's been with her husband and step-sons for 40 years. She fully trusts them,
*  so she signs the documents they give her, even the ones that are in Japanese. And then suddenly
*  a painting on her wall disappears. She stops being invited to the family vacation homes.
*  Her step-sons tell her she has to move apartments. Everything she's taken for granted is going away
*  and she realizes finally she's been deceived. So she hires a lawyer and together they begin
*  to unravel the magnitude of this family's wealth. The Wildensteins claimed Daniel was worth 61
*  million dollars when he died. By some estimates the family was worth 10 billion dollars.
*  Sylvia is discovering alongside her lawyer just how much of the Wildenstein's assets are hidden
*  in offshore trusts and tax havens and when she dies she actually leaves in her will that she
*  wants this fight to continue. It was her life's mission at that point to untangle the Wildenstein's
*  financial empire. So here's my article, The Inheritance Case That Could Unravel an Art
*  Dynasty, read by Samantha Dez. 20 years ago a glamorous platinum blonde widow arrived at the
*  Paris law office of Claude Dumont Beguie in tears. Someone was trying to take her horses, her babies
*  away and she needed a lawyer to stop them. She explained that her late husband was a breeder of
*  champion thoroughbreds. The couple was a familiar sight at the racetracks in Chantilly and Paris.
*  Danielle Wildenstein, gray suited with a cane in the stands and Sylvia Roth Wildenstein,
*  a former model with a cigarette dangling from her lips. They first met in 1964 while she was
*  walking couture shows in Paris and he was languishing in a marriage of convenience to
*  a woman from another wealthy Jewish family of art collectors. Danielle, 16 years Sylvia senior,
*  already had two grown sons when they met and he didn't want more children. So over the next 40
*  years they spent together Sylvia cared for the horses as if they were the children she never had.
*  When Danielle died of cancer in 2001 he left her a small stable.
*  Then one morning about a year later Sylvia's phone rang. It was her horse trainer calling to
*  say that he had spotted something odd in the local racing paper Paris Turf. The results of
*  Sylvia's stable were no longer listed under her name. The French journalist Magalie Serra's 2013
*  book Les Wildenstein recounts the scene in great detail. Sylvia ran to fetch her copy and flipped
*  to the page. Sure enough the stable of Madame Wildenstein had been replaced by Détone Limited,
*  an Irish company owned by her step-sons. That's when she called Dumont-Beguille.
*  To the lawyer's surprise Sylvia showed up to their meeting with no proof of ownership for the horses
*  and no information on her late husband's estate.
*  She didn't have any, any documents at all, Dumont-Beguille says. Sylvia mentioned that
*  she signed some papers shortly after her husband's death but she didn't know what they said nor did
*  she have copies. I put that in the corner of my mind, Dumont-Beguille says. Why would a widow
*  draped in diamonds and furs have no records from her wealthy husband's estate?
*  Dumont-Beguille got the feeling there was more going on than a dispute over horses.
*  But she went ahead and gave Sylvia the good news. She could simply decline to transfer the horses
*  to her step-sons. Dumont-Beguille sent a letter halting the transaction.
*  Dumont-Beguille recalls an almost instant kinship with Sylvia who discovered that they were both
*  Scorpios and lived in the same building complex in the posh 16th arrondissement.
*  After Dumont-Beguille saved her horses, Sylvia trusted her completely and she began to explain
*  to Dumont-Beguille the complexity of the situation. Daniel had fallen into a coma for 10 days before
*  he died and while he was under, his sons, Alec and Guy showed up at the hospital along with lawyers
*  from Switzerland, the United States, and France. She recounted how a few weeks after the funeral,
*  her driver took her to the family's 18th century Hôtel Particulier, which housed an art research
*  center, the Wieldenstein Institute. Her step-sons told her she needed to hear something important.
*  They had reviewed their father's estate and discovered that he died in financial ruin.
*  As his next of kin, Sylvia was about to inherit debts so large they would ruin her too.
*  Sylvia was stunned. She had never heard anything about money troubles from her husband.
*  For 40 years, she had lived with chefs and chauffeurs in at least five homes on three continents.
*  But what did she know? She never signed the checks.
*  Danielle, intellectual and rigid, ran the business, while Sylvia, who was light and cheerful,
*  played the nurturer in the family. She was known to dote on Alec and Guy's six children,
*  whom she considered her grandkids. She trusted her step-sons completely.
*  So when they told her that she must renounce her inheritance at once or face catastrophe,
*  she didn't blink. I signed all the papers they presented to me. I signed, signed, signed.
*  Even the ones written in Japanese, she later told Sarah. They promised to take care of her
*  financially and even offered to pay her 30,000 euros a month out of their own pockets. Sylvia
*  was grateful. But then, over the next few months, the reality of what she had done set in. Sylvia
*  told du Montbeguin her movers came to her apartment and took a beloved Pierre Bonnard
*  painting off the wall. Then they came back for the furniture, because, she was told,
*  it belonged to her husband's business, which was now run by his sons.
*  A letter came notifying her that Danielle's 69 thoroughbreds were now owned by Guy and
*  Alec's stable. Her household staff stopped being paid. Soon, her step-sons told her she would have
*  to move from her home on Avenue Montagne to another apartment. Alec died in 2008. Guy declined
*  a request for an interview, though a representative answered some questions provided by the Times.
*  She stopped receiving invitations to celebrate holidays and birthdays at the family's ranch in
*  Kenya or their castle in France. Guy shipped back her clothes and belongings from their British
*  Virgin Islands compound, where she had vacationed for years with Danielle and their chef and pastry
*  chef. As Sylvia spoke, two things became increasingly apparent to du Montbeguin.
*  One, Sylvia had renounced her inheritance. She had no freedom, she says, and no proof,
*  not a shred of evidence. No bank account, no income, no independence. It was as if she died
*  at the same time as her husband, du Montbeguin says. The other thing that struck her was that
*  the Wildensteins were more than merely rich. When she first came to me, I didn't know anything
*  about the family, du Montbeguin told me when I visited her this past winter at her office in
*  Paris. To my left, a bronze bust of a panther stared from a pedestal at eye level. Behind
*  her glass desk hung a print of a leopard prowling in a tree. Du Montbeguin is also the personal
*  attorney for President Ali Bongo Udimba of Gabon, who is widely considered a strong man,
*  and often describes herself as a lone warrior woman in a jungle of male adversaries.
*  She had never heard of the Wildenstein dynasty of art dealers. In fact, outside elite niches of the
*  art world, few had, which was how Danielle wanted it. Du Montbeguin was about to find out why.
*  First, she drew up a list of known assets, which soon zigzagged into a chart of far-flung bank
*  accounts, trusts, and shell corporations. Over the course of several years, she would fly around
*  the world to tax havens and freeports, prying open the armored vaults and anonymous accounts
*  that mask many of the high-end transactions in the $68 billion global art market.
*  Multi-million dollar paintings can anonymously trade hands without, for example, any of the
*  requisite titles or deeds of real estate transactions, or the public disclosures
*  required on Wall Street. She would learn that the inscrutability of the trade has made it a
*  leading conduit for sanction-evading oligarchs and other billionaires looking to launder excess
*  capital. The Wildensteins were not just masters of this system. They helped pioneer it.
*  Over 150 years, the family has amassed an art collection estimated to be worth billions
*  by quietly buying up troves of European masterpieces that would be at home in the
*  Louvre or the Vatican, holding their stock for generations and never revealing what they own.
*  When Sylvia realized the magnitude of her stepson's deception, she devoted the rest of her life to
*  unraveling the family's financial machinations and even left a will asking that Dumont-Bégui
*  continue her fight from beyond the grave. Sylvia and her lawyer were never able to win the
*  settlement they thought she deserved while she was alive. From the start, in 2004, a judge rejected
*  Dumont-Bégui's attempt to cancel Sylvia's renunciation of the inheritance. A few years later,
*  a court rejected a subsequent claim that she was entitled to 450 million euro worth of art and
*  assets, a figure the judge called pharaonic. The representative for Guy notes that early on,
*  Sylvia was awarded approximately 15 million euro based on the value of Danielle's French estate.
*  Dumont-Bégui continued to litigate for several years, seeking to have certain trusts settled by
*  Danielle Wieldenstein included in the estate, the representative says. During this protracted
*  litigation, Dumont-Bégui made numerous unsubstantiated allegations, but the court
*  ultimately ruled against her client. Now, more than a decade after Sylvia's death,
*  their efforts have landed the Wieldensteins before France's highest court. The evidence she and Dumont-Bégui
*  brought forth has persuaded prosecutors that the Wieldensteins are a criminal enterprise,
*  responsible for operating, as a prosecutor for the state once put it,
*  the longest and the most sophisticated tax fraud in modern French history. A trial this September
*  will determine if the family and their associates owe a gargantuan tax bill.
*  The last time prosecutors went after the Wieldensteins several years ago, they sought 866 million
*  euro, 616 million euro in back taxes and a 250 million euro fine, as well as jail time for Guy.
*  The consequences could do more than topple the family's art empire. The case has provided an
*  unusual view of how the ultra-wealthy use the art market to evade taxes, and sometimes worse.
*  Agents raiding Wieldenstein vaults have turned up artworks long reported as missing,
*  which fueled speculation that the family may have owned Nazi-looted or otherwise stolen art,
*  and spurred a number of other lawsuits against the family in recent years.
*  Financial distortions have saved the family hundreds of millions of dollars, prosecutors
*  allege, but their treatment of Sylvia could cost them far more, and perhaps lead to the
*  unraveling of their dynasty. In order to prove that Elec and Guy misled Sylvia about her husband's
*  estate, Dumont-Baguay first needed to know what assets they did report. But because Sylvia had
*  renounced her inheritance, she didn't even have a right to that information.
*  Every deed, every bank statement, every inventory item in the estate, and every document related to
*  the succession of Danielle Wieldenstein is in the hands of Guy and Elec, Dumont-Baguay says,
*  and they did not intend to turn them over. Dumont-Baguay's first step then was to ask
*  a court to nullify the agreement Sylvia signed giving up her inheritance. Only then could she
*  access details about Danielle's estate. Fortunately, she had a compelling precedent
*  to show the judge. Sylvia wasn't the first wife the Wieldensteins had tried to cut off by pleading
*  poverty. Jocelyne Wieldenstein, Elec's first wife, was similarly cut out of the family's fortune
*  during her 1999 divorce, with Elec claiming he was an unpaid personal assistant to his father.
*  Documents revealed at court in New York, where the couple primarily lived,
*  valued the family's art collection at about $10 billion. The judge in the case said that
*  Elec's income statement insults the intelligence of the court. He settled for a rumored $3.8 billion,
*  which would be the largest divorce settlement in New York history.
*  Jocelyne denies that the settlement was $3.8 billion, but did concede that it was huge.
*  Dumont-Baguay argued that if the family was worth billions then, there was reason to doubt that
*  Danielle, who orchestrated the deal between Elec and Jocelyne, died in ruinous debt just two years
*  later. The French court ordered Guy and Elec to hand over the declaration of Danielle's estate.
*  It included some properties in France, a few cars, paintings and bank accounts,
*  altogether totaling 42 million euro. Dumont-Baguay didn't believe that figure was anywhere near the
*  estate's true value, but still. It's not nothing for someone who died broke. And it showed, Dumont-Baguay
*  concluded, that Sylvia had renounced her inheritance under false pretenses.
*  Dumont-Baguay's next move was to get her hands on Danielle's medical records.
*  She learned that he spent his final days in an unresponsive vegetative coma. And yet, apparently
*  signed a contract selling his 69 thoroughbreds, including Sylvia's, to his sons for a bargain
*  price. In 2005, a court granted Sylvia's request to nullify her renunciation. It was only the
*  beginning of what Dumont-Baguay has called her international treasure hunt, for every stashed
*  masterpiece, undeclared property and offshore account left out of Danielle's estate.
*  Her next order of business was to locate Sylvia's beloved bonnard nude, a gift from Danielle that
*  his sons had removed from her wall. Dumont-Baguay knew it was included in a trust that Danielle had
*  set up for his wife in the Bahamas. But when she asked the trustee for information about its
*  contents, management, and regulations, she received no response. Dumont-Baguay decided to do her own
*  research on Danielle's collection of bonnards. She learned from his memoir Marchandard, published
*  two years before his death, that he considered their acquisition the biggest coup of his life.
*  When Bonnard died in 1947, he left behind an enormous estate of some 700 paintings and
*  thousands of drawings. Danielle learned that all of it was set to be inherited by three estranged
*  nieces-in-law of the artist, and it gave him an idea. He approached another Bonnard relative,
*  who Danielle believed could also lay claim to the estate, and told the man he would pay him $1 million
*  to buy his inheritance rights. Then he armed the man with a battalion of lawyers to fight on his
*  behalf. After more than a decade in court, Danielle walked away with nearly 500 paintings. The nieces
*  were left with just 25. Danielle promised them some more to prevent further litigation.
*  In his memoir, Danielle revealed that he still owned 180 Bonnard paintings, and not just any
*  bonnards, but the most beautiful, the most magnificent. He added that the great bonnards
*  were worth between $5 million and $7 million each. Today, they can sell for twice that.
*  Dumont-Baguay flew to the Bahamas to find out what other paintings by the artist Danielle may have
*  left for Sylvia. She received a court order to open up the trust, and found that Danielle had
*  bequeathed no fewer than 19 bonnards to her client. Though the trust was nominally in the Bahamas,
*  the bonnards were being held at the Geneva Freeport, a prison-like complex of high-security
*  storage facilities that is said to contain more art than the Louvre. Independent of any national
*  jurisdiction, freeports allow traders to ship and store property without paying taxes or customs
*  duties. If a dealer buys a painting in one country, he can ship it to a freeport without paying import
*  taxes. Then, when he is offered the right price, he can sell it there, too, without paying capital
*  gains. It has been estimated that $100 billion worth of art and collectibles are held in the
*  Geneva Freeport alone, to say nothing of those in Zurich, Luxembourg, Singapore, Monaco, Delaware,
*  or Beijing. Dumont-Baguay flew to the Geneva Freeport, which is the size of 22 soccer fields,
*  along with an appraiser to examine the bonnards in person.
*  Bonnard is light, Danielle wrote of his favorite artist, who is known above all for his radiant
*  use of color. But when Dumont-Baguay descended two flights down into the gloomy bunker,
*  she found the paintings locked behind an armored door, including Sylvia's pink nude in the bath,
*  its warm glow extinguished in the dark. An acquaintance in the art world explained
*  to Dumont-Baguay that hundreds, if not thousands, of Wieldenstein works are held in museums,
*  but that the labels often identify their owners simply as private collection. So she wrote to the
*  major museums, to the Louvre, the Hermitage, the Prado, to ask whether Danielle Wieldenstein
*  ever lent or donated works to them. Surprisingly, she says, a few wrote back. The National Gallery
*  in London told her that Danielle lent it valuable paintings by Poussin and Boucher. The Prado had
*  recently bought a Velasquez portrait from Wieldenstein and Company Inc. for 23 million euro.
*  Ven Dumont-Baguay made perhaps the most important stop of her tour, the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
*  where she stood before a painting she loved, Caravaggio's late masterpiece, The Loot Player,
*  labeled on loan from a private collection. She searched the New York State Department's records
*  to see whether Wieldenstein and Co. had ever borrowed money using works in its collection
*  as collateral. Dozens of names were listed. Cézanne, David, Degas, Manet, Monet, Matisse,
*  Rembrandt, Picasso, and Rodin, among them. And then there it was. The Loot Player,
*  valued at upward of 100 million dollars.
*  At that point, she realized, the company is titanic.
*  In my family, we have elevated discretion to the level of muteness. Danielle wrote in his memoir,
*  We do not speak. We don't tell. We don't talk about one another.
*  This code of omerta has been the governing principle of the Wieldenstein art dynasty
*  since its founding five generations ago. A dealer is not allowed to talk about his stock,
*  Danielle said. Why? Because it's the stuff of dreams. Every art dealer must maintain the
*  illusion of the masterpieces he owns or does not own. Many believed that his grandfather,
*  his grandfather, the founding patriarch Nathan Wieldenstein, for example, owned 10 Vermeers.
*  He actually had just one. No one knows today whether the family still owns it,
*  and that question is meaningful to art history. Experts believe Vermeer made about three dozen
*  paintings in his life, and as many as nine could be missing.
*  A tailor from Alsace, Nathan had no training in art when, in the 1870s, a client asked him to
*  sell some artwork she owned. He holed himself up in the Louvre for 10 days, according to Danielle,
*  and came out a believer. He sold the art and used the 1,000 francs he earned to buy two more
*  pictures by the Rococo artists Francois Boucher and Maurice Compton de la Tour, which he resold.
*  At the time, Nathan could afford 17th and 18th century French art because no one else wanted it,
*  so he amassed passé, but to his eye beautiful, paintings. He began dressing in embroidered
*  waistcoats and top hats to pitch collectors and critics. Soon, Nathan was selling his taste to
*  Rothschilds and Rockefellers in Europe and the United States. While Nathan was grooming his
*  young grandson to enter the family business, he took him to see a silent film about a man who wore
*  a hat that everyone initially mocked. By the end of the movie, the whole town was wearing one.
*  Nathan explained to Danielle that this was their family's calling.
*  Find the guy's hat and wear it before the others.
*  For Nathan, that hat was French art of the 18th century.
*  These are now among the most famous names in art history, but at the time, they were synonymous
*  with the French Revolution and the aristocrats it overthrew, a period the public wanted to put
*  behind them, especially as they began to embrace the avant-garde era of Impressionism.
*  In 1905, Nathan bought an Hôtel Particulier in the center of Paris to house Wildenstein and Co.
*  He expanded into Renaissance art and Impressionism, and when his son Georges,
*  Danielle's father, was old enough to join the business, a bit of modernism.
*  Nathan bought a space down the street for Georges and his friend Paul Rosenberg to set up a small
*  operation. The pair gave two of its floors to Picasso, whom they agreed in 1918 to pay a
*  generous salary in exchange for first pick of the artist's works. Georges installed a red telephone
*  in his office that had two direct lines, one connected to Rosenberg, the other to Picasso's
*  studio. Upon Nathan's death in 1934, Georges steered the family into an era of unprecedented
*  prosperity by building an infrastructure around his artist's markets. He organized exhibitions,
*  edited an art journal, and published definitive catalogs of works by artists in his inventory.
*  Ingres, Fragonard, Chardon.
*  Danielle would later do the same with Monet, Manet, and Gauguin.
*  The books were well respected and helped market their artists to museums.
*  They also gave the family final say over authentication questions.
*  Today, anyone who thinks he or she owns a Monet that's not in the Wildenstein book
*  needs a nonprofit co-founded by Guy to sign off on it.
*  When the Wildenstein Institute handled the authentications directly,
*  it developed a reputation for being unaccommodating.
*  But Georges' ruthless instincts also contributed to the dark aura, as one dealer put it,
*  that would come to surround the Wildenstein name. Hitler's personal curator told an allied
*  intelligence agent in an interrogation after the war that Georges did brisk business with
*  the Nazis after fleeing to Provence in the unoccupied zone. Once there, he helped the
*  Germans locate important collections in occupied France in exchange for sparing his own.
*  Profits from his newly-arianized gallery in Paris were said to be sent to New York,
*  where he had opened a branch. The representative for Guy denies this.
*  Other art-dealing dynasties have since sprung up in the Wildenstein mold. They buy up huge
*  quantities of blue-chip art and store it for years, until they effectively corner their own
*  niches of the market and control the prices. The billionaire Named brothers and their sons,
*  based among London, New York, and Monaco, reportedly bought more works by Picasso than
*  any other family in the world, except the Picassos, and, for the most part,
*  have locked them up in the Geneva Freeport for years while they accumulate value.
*  The McRobbie family of pop art dealer collectors led by its patriarch Jose McRobbie and his two
*  sons have done the same with Andy Warhol, stockpiling some 1,000 works by the artist
*  and keeping prices high by bidding his art up at auction, even if they don't intend to buy.
*  The McRobbie family did not respond to a request for comment.
*  Those who complain that the art market today operates more like the stock market
*  often blame these families, who shifted a value system once driven by connoisseurship
*  to one based on the law of scarcity. Monet and Picasso are like Microsoft and Coca-Cola,
*  David Named once said. Their dominance derives from the fact that they're family firms,
*  bolstered by internal secrecy, pride, and lifetimes of experience.
*  As the Wieldenstein's proved, families can be structured like corporations,
*  where the profit principle governs even relationships and succession plans.
*  The few people who seem capable of undoing them are themselves. For the Wieldenstein's,
*  the weight of the family legacy seems to have cracked the younger generations.
*  Even though Daniel described Jorge as a bad father, he parented his own children in similarly
*  severe ways. He enforced his father's business tactics, extreme secrecy, consolidation of wealth
*  in the bloodline, as laws of family life, too. Daniel tried to seclude his two children,
*  Alac and Guy, at home and unmarried, to protect the family from publicity and divorce.
*  They lived as if in another era, the French 18th century, with opulent floral decor,
*  heavy drapes, and footmen who stood behind their chairs during meals. As children, Guy and Alac
*  commuted to the L'ici-Francais du New York by limousine, and they rarely had a playdate.
*  Alac was forbidden to play sports and attend university, Guy was prevented from pursuing
*  acting, and both were required to learn their father's trade. Daniel was particularly strict
*  with Alac, his elder son. According to a 1998 Vanity Fair article, he started taking Alac
*  to brothels at age 15, in the hope that he would find prostitutes a satisfying alternative to a
*  wife. When Alac defied his father and married Jocelyne, he did so secretly in Las Vegas with
*  no guests. Eventually, Daniel's sons and wives and children all lived together in his New York
*  townhouse. Those who know Daniel have said that he infantilized and humiliated his sons,
*  and that they've gone on to treat the women in their lives similarly.
*  Guy, Sylvia believed, was jealous of Daniel and took it out on her. Alac blamed Jocelyne for the
*  humiliating headlines generated by their divorce. The New York Post dubbed her the bride of
*  Wieldenstein for her apparently extensive plastic surgeries. Alac, who wore bold pinstripe suits,
*  was the flashier brother. Guy kept a lower profile, but played on the Diable Blue polo team
*  with aristocratic friends, like the future King Charles III, the godfather of his eldest child.
*  Colleagues remember that the brothers would sit quietly in meetings. Guy married a Swedish model
*  named Kristina Hansson, who has never appeared in a tabloid. In fact, he once boasted that,
*  hardly anyone knows what my wife looks like. So when Daniel died in 2001, Guy was the clear
*  successor to the family art empire, while Alac took over the horse business.
*  Guy, who is now 77, is the family's patriarch and president of Wieldenstein and co.
*  But mounting lawsuits and scandals have begun to drag him down.
*  So far, he has avoided any serious consequences. A fact some critics attribute to well-positioned
*  friends, like former president Nicolas Sarkozy, or to the fortune at his disposal for defense council.
*  But now that the family is on trial, Guy, it seems, may have taken the legacy of silence
*  too far. The Wieldenstein policy to preserve confidentiality at any cost
*  may ultimately expose the family secrets. In 2009, after a long string of setbacks,
*  Dumont-Begui had a breakthrough. Over the years, she had sent Luba Wieldenstein, Alac's second wife,
*  multiple summonses for information about the family's assets. Unsurprisingly, she ignored them.
*  But after Alac died of prostate cancer at age 67 in 2008, Luba, a former model from Russia,
*  found herself in trouble. According to Sarah's book, Alac owed 12 million euro in back taxes.
*  And his father's estate was still tied up in litigation with Sylvia. Guy offered to lend Luba
*  the money to help pay his brother's debt. All she had to do in return was give him access to a trust
*  Alac had set up for her, supposedly so Guy could reimburse himself later.
*  But after the deal was done, Sarah's book recounts, Guy didn't pay Luba the millions he promised.
*  He sent only small, sporadic sums, not enough to pay her tax bill or to live on.
*  Luba found herself in a situation much like Sylvia's, cut out from the family with no money
*  and no recourse. The representative for Guy says that he did issue the loan.
*  That's when Dumont-Begui's phone rang. Luba had finally decided to answer her third summons.
*  She told me recently that she felt she had no choice but to take action.
*  Many women in the family had to fight for their rights, she said. The women want to be respected.
*  24 hours later, a lawyer would deliver Dumont-Begui dozens of documents that Luba had found on Alac's
*  personal computer, contracts and letters about the family's expansive network of offshore trusts,
*  which would reveal what Dumont-Begui and Sylvia had long believed without being able to definitively
*  prove. The documents mapped how the Wieldensteins had structured their patrimony and hid their wealth
*  for generations. Danielle's estate, Dumont-Begui learned, included several hundred artworks,
*  including the 180 bonars, hundreds of 16th and 17th century French paintings,
*  and dozens of works by old masters including Corvaggio, Velasquez, and Fra Angelico.
*  Then there was the real estate, multiple homes and buildings across France and the United States,
*  the 58,000 acre ranch in Kenya, and the 18 acre Virgin Islands compound. There was a Gulf Stream
*  4 jet, a yacht, and the thoroughbred stable, which was registered to multiple intermediaries
*  in England and Ireland. The art was held in shell companies and trusts in tax havens,
*  including two previously unknown entities in the Cayman Islands and Guernsey. These were
*  operational structures specializing in tax evasion, Dumont-Begui wrote, which also helped the family
*  shield assets from divorce. The representative for Guy disputes the accuracy of this recounting of
*  the estate. According to Dumont-Begui, two trusts named Sylvia as a beneficiary, something Sylvia
*  said she was unaware of. Also revealed was a letter from Guy and a Lux Swiss lawyer seeking
*  to remove Sylvia as beneficiary from one of the trusts. Investigators also discovered $250
*  million in art that Danielle had apparently ordered airlifted out of the United States
*  while he was in his coma. The representative for Guy denies that this is true, calling it illogical.
*  Dumont-Begui rapidly began to issue new summonses and build an appeal for a review.
*  But time was running out. Sylvia had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, which was spreading.
*  She was running out of resources, too. I have no more money, Sarah recounted her saying.
*  This procedure has brought me to my knees. She had paid more than 10 million euro in legal fees over
*  the past eight years and had resorted to pawn her jewelry and relying on help from wealthy friends.
*  In her final interview, she said of her step-sons,
*  they robbed me and now they are waiting for me to die.
*  Dumont-Begui continued on, believing that Sylvia was entitled to a settlement of $300 million.
*  She filed a new criminal complaint against Guy and the heirs of Alec, his two children and Luba,
*  as well as their business associates, using the new information she had received.
*  To her surprise, this time the government responded.
*  The police raided the Wildenstein Institute and the family's apartments on a court order to
*  identify any assets that might have been concealed from Sylvia. In the basement,
*  officers discovered vaults filled with hundreds of drawings, paintings, and sculptures.
*  Some of the frames were inscribed with swastikas.
*  Officers seized about 30 lost works by the likes of Degas and Berta Morisol.
*  Some had been reported stolen by a Jewish family during the war, and others were reported lost by
*  families who had involved Danielle in the management of their estates.
*  Guy pleaded ignorance. He never inspected that vault. And who could prove otherwise?
*  The family took such pains to protect their inventory that no one knows what they really have.
*  Perhaps not even them.
*  The Wildensteins were cleared in one of the lost painting suits.
*  Guy has said that the Morisol may have been put there as a result of an oversight.
*  Dumont-Begui's involvement in the Wildenstein affair officially ended on November 8, 2010,
*  when she called Sylvia for the last time to wish her a happy 77th birthday.
*  Five days later, Sylvia died at home in Paris. She was buried in the Wildenstein tomb next to
*  her husband. But Guy had her maiden name wrought etched into the marble tombstone.
*  Without a client, Dumont-Begui's case was closed for good.
*  But the lawsuit was far from over for Guy, as the state picked up where Dumont-Begui left off.
*  She had mapped for the government the global system through which the family moved money
*  among nine companies registered in Ireland. Four trusts on three islands, a handful of galleries
*  and real estate companies and bank accounts in at least four countries, possibly depriving
*  the French public of hundreds of millions of euros. In addition to the state's financial
*  aid, the Swiss Free Port and the Paris Vault, they had art in a nuclear bunker in the Catskills,
*  a former fire station in New York and many other far-flung places.
*  I mean, there are pictures I have never seen that my great-grandfather bought,
*  Alec told Vanity Fair in 1998. They were, he said, in vaults and crazy places, in back of other things.
*  Over the next decade, the Wildenstein tax case wound its way through the French courts.
*  At the same time, public outrage over tax loopholes for the wealthy was growing,
*  and the government passed what is popularly known as the Wildenstein law
*  to crack down on tax evasion via foreign trusts.
*  Still, the family won two controversial acquittals, first in 2017 and then again in 2018.
*  But then, two years ago, France's attorney general and tax authorities brought concerns about the
*  decision to acquit the Wildensteins of tax fraud and money laundering to the Court of Cassation,
*  France's highest civil and criminal court. The lead judge in the 2017 case had said that the
*  family displayed a clear intention to hide their wealth, but the tribunal let them off because,
*  at the time, foreign trusts fell into a legal gray area. In reopening the case,
*  the Court of Cassation disagreed, saying the lower court disregarded the facts.
*  It's really uncommon, Dumont-Begui says, of the upcoming retrial. She believes the path to victory
*  will be much tougher for Guy and his co-defendants this time. Prosecutors will argue that the
*  Wildensteins were, in fact, required to report their foreign trusts at the time of Danielle's
*  death and later, Alex. They also contend that the trustees improperly took orders from the family
*  in violation of the rules of irrevocable trusts, which must be independently managed.
*  The extreme lengths to which the family went to obscure their wealth led French media to dub them
*  the impressionists of finance. But in reality, many of their practices are commonplace in high
*  levels of the art trade, which a 2020 U.S. Senate subcommittee called the largest legal unregulated
*  market. Unlike financial institutions, art businesses are not expressly subject to the
*  Bank Secrecy Act, which requires firms to verify customers' identities, report large cash transfers,
*  and flag suspicious activity. A study from the U.S. Department of the Treasury last year cited a
*  figure estimating that money laundering and other financial crimes in the art market may amount to
*  about $3 billion a year. Britain and the European Union, however, have implemented anti-money
*  laundering regulations that require stricter due diligence in art transactions there.
*  According to a report by Art Basel and UBS, auction houses did about $31 billion in sales last year.
*  They say that they know who their clients are, but those may just be the names of art advisors or
*  other intermediaries, and collectors' insistence on anonymity, long framed as genteel discretion,
*  hasn't budged. The buyer of the most expensive auction house in the world, the U.S., has been
*  the buyer of the most expensive artwork ever sold at auction, Leonardo da Vinci's $450.3 million
*  Salvatore Mundi, registered at Christie's a day before bidding with a $100 million down payment,
*  identifying himself as one of 5,000 princes in Saudi Arabia. A few weeks later, it was revealed
*  that the true buyer was Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who was reportedly displaying the
*  painting on his super yacht and that a little-known cousin of his bought it as a proxy.
*  It was billed by Christie's as the last Leonardo da Vinci painting in private hands.
*  But it's only the last Leonardo until someone reveals another one, like the Madonna and Child,
*  the Wildenstein sold in 1999 to an anonymous collector, who is still believed to own it.
*  For a business that routinely transacts in secrecy jurisdictions, literally in the dark
*  and underground, scarcity can be manufactured, and value is dictated by whatever someone is willing
*  to pay. A client's privacy should be an art dealer's primary concern, Danielle wrote, calling
*  it a matter of respect. But secrecy is also a core competitive advantage in a profession predicated
*  on insider knowledge, a model the Wildensteins themselves relied on. The gallery kept a legendarily
*  detailed directory of where every coveted painting in the world was located, using intelligence
*  sometimes gathered by spying on rival dealers, even, one competitor alleged, tapping phones.
*  That system of ultra-insular knowledge and extreme scarcity is why, today, the dealers who bought
*  Salvatore Mundi for $1,175 at a New Orleans auction house were able to resell it for a reputed $80
*  million, and then, in the span of five years, see it flipped for $127.5 million to the collector,
*  who ultimately sold it to the Saudis, for the record-breaking $450 million.
*  Younger dynasties like the Mughrabis and Nameds have similarly been accused of strategically
*  obscuring ownership of their assets to shield them from divorce or other legal claims.
*  When a Frenchman accused the Nameds of possessing a Modigliani painting, once estimated to be worth
*  up to $25 million, that Nazis looted from his grandfather, they said it was owned by a company
*  called International Art Center. A couple years later, the Panama Papers revealed that David
*  Named owns International Art Center, a holding company whose assets are stored in Geneva.
*  A representative for the Named collection says the case has no merit.
*  Many of these very wealthy families do sort of act like cartels, says Christopher A. Maranello,
*  a lawyer who recovers lost art. We're still dealing with these Nazi-looted art cases because
*  the art market hoped they would outlast the heirs. The Wieldenstein's, too, he says, have handled
*  problematic pictures, though none that he is currently pursuing are in their possession.
*  Whenever he asks the family for information that might aid in his search for stolen pictures,
*  they take a very long time to respond, he says, and are reluctant to provide information.
*  They're just looking the other way, he says. It's just this unwillingness to lift a finger and do
*  anything. I met Dumont-Begui once more in New York, where she had come to visit galleries with
*  her son, an artist and designer. At a windy table outside Harry Cipriani's food hall on the Upper
*  West Side, she told me that she plans to attend every day of the Wieldenstein trial this fall.
*  It will finally mark the end of the defining case of her career.
*  It's my professional life, it's my personal life, she said. I start something, I finish it.
*  I will go every day. I want to see it through. Her long entanglement in the case created legal
*  troubles for her, too. Guy Wieldenstein sued her for defamation in 2016. A few years later,
*  she was convicted of tax fraud and money laundering for depositing $5.1 million she received from
*  Sylvia in an undisclosed HSBC account in New York. She is currently pursuing a partial appeal
*  and has suggested that the $5.1 million was a customary gift. Guy dropped the defamation suit
*  two years ago. In 2012, Dumont-Begui published a book about her seven years on the case,
*  L'Affaire Wieldenstein. In the opening lines, she describes it as a story of two women alone
*  facing the establishment, run by privileged and powerful men like the Wieldensteins,
*  a universe where women are omitted. Some have questioned whether Dumont-Begui was really
*  representing her client's best interests in pursuing the costly, years-long battle.
*  But regardless of her motives, it's obvious that the saga has become personal for her.
*  Her eyes welled up when she spoke of Sylvia's death. She wanted the world to know that as a
*  woman, she wanted to be respected. She described tax fraud as a crime that disproportionately
*  deprives women. This is what she and Sylvia were fighting for.
*  It may be hard to understand the depth of our relationship, she told me.
*  With a potential billion-dollar guillotine hanging over its neck, the House of Wieldenstein is in
*  unprecedented peril. Even before this latest legal trouble, its influence waned for years,
*  as the market for the historical art it sells declined and museums are by now fully stocked.
*  As Danielle reached his eighth decade, he started waking up in the mornings asking himself,
*  how long are we going to last? The profession his family dominated for most of the 20th century
*  had been overtaken by a new guard of contemporary art dealers selling status baubles to Wall Street
*  millionaires. These collectors weren't interested in Rococo or Neoclassical art. They were spending
*  millions on living stars like Damien Hirst, whose market the advertising tycoon Charles
*  Sachi has dominated since he bought up vast quantities of the artist's early work.
*  Danielle tried to get in on the frenzy by forming a joint venture with Pace Gallery in 1993.
*  But its contemporary clients generally didn't convert to Impressionism or Old Master Collectors
*  and vice versa. It was a mistake. Pace's founder Arnie Glimcher told me,
*  I think we did it because we were so flattered. Pace bought back its shares plus inventory from
*  Gee in 2011. Now the family appears to be liquidating some assets. In 2020,
*  Gee and his wife put their Tudor estate in Millbrook, New York, which they spent a reported
*  $50 million renovating, on the market for $20 million. Around the same time, their son David
*  and his wife, the jewelry heiress Lucrezia Bucciolatti-Wildenstein, listed their Connecticut
*  equestrian compound for $6.9 million. The Virgin Islands property is up for sale, too, for $48
*  million. In 2016, while facing his initial tax trial in Paris, Gee listed his Sutton Square
*  townhouse in Manhattan, Corcoran blurred the paintings on the walls, naturally, for nearly
*  $40 million, only to finally offer it at a loss in March for $29.5 million.
*  I see the end of this empire, the Old Master's expert Eric Twerking says.
*  The organization is too heavy for a market that has shrunk.
*  The market is one-tenth of what it used to be for 18th-century French art.
*  Some market insiders have noticed that the family seems to be selling off more art lately, too.
*  Though paintings are often sold at auction anonymously,
*  Providence histories can reveal ownership information. In the past two years or so,
*  they sold a lot of paintings at auction at Christie's, not under their own name,
*  says Robert Simon, one of the Old Master's dealers who rediscovered Salvatore Mundi.
*  But when they're catalogued, you can see that they're shown by Wildenstein in previous shows,
*  or were acquired here and there. He adds, and then they've kind of shed their staff as well.
*  The mass liquidation of assets suggests that the family could be anticipating a large expenditure,
*  like an overdue tax bill.
*  In 1932, Georges Wildenstein hired the society architect Horace Trumbauer to design the family's
*  majestic limestone gallery on East 64th Street, with marble floors, gilded wood paneling,
*  and lead vaults. It was the grandest gallery in New York, Simon says, recalling the heavy drapes
*  the Wildensteins would pull back to reveal paintings to clients. It's where they sold
*  one of Raphael's most treasured Madonnas, Cayet-Bot's iconic cityscape Paris Street Rainy Day,
*  and Cézanne's largest and most lyrical Bathers. Guy's son David, who is vice president of
*  Wildenstein and Co., has described the building as,
*  the soul of this company and the soul of this family. Yet he helped sell it in 2017 for $79.8
*  million, then the highest price ever paid for a townhouse in New York. The contemporary art
*  gallery, LGDR, has since taken occupancy of the space, while Wildenstein and Co. has moved into
*  a 15-story commercial building in Midtown, open by appointment only. It's like an office,
*  one dealer told me. A small office.
*  you
