# A Mother, a Daughter, a Deadly Journey: An Update
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e2lGqZeZec)
*  Hey, it's Michael.
*  This week, The Daily is revisiting some of our favorite episodes of the year, listening
*  back and hearing what's happened in the time since they first ran.
*  Today, we return to a mother and daughter who, along with hundreds of thousands of others,
*  made a harrowing journey through the Darien Gap, and we find out where they ended up.
*  It's Thursday, December 28th.
*  Julie, tell us what we should know about this place, the Darien Gap.
*  The Darien Gap is this narrow sliver of land between Colombia and Panama.
*  It connects South and Central Americas, and this slip of land is a jungle, and it's an
*  extremely inhospitable jungle.
*  And this is because the territory is sheer mountains, intense, intense mud.
*  To be able to traverse it on foot is very dangerous because there are deadly animals,
*  bugs, snakes, fast running rivers.
*  And it's sort of a changing territory too, because it's incredibly wet.
*  This place has no road.
*  For years, what you saw was that a small number of migrants who sort of heard word of mouth
*  about the possibility of crossing, that they could do it, were braving this trek.
*  And so you saw between 2010 and 2020 an average of under 11,000 people crossing a year.
*  What you've seen in the last two years is an enormous historic rise in people crossing
*  this very dangerous, in many cases, deadly jungle.
*  How many more people?
*  What we saw in 2022 was almost 250,000 people cross the Darien Gap.
*  And what explains why so many people are trying to take this treacherous journey right now?
*  So first of all, the pandemic really hit economies in South America hard.
*  And because the crisis was region wide, this left one way out.
*  And that way out was north through the Darien Gap.
*  And so we see traffickers advertising on social media, encouraging people to come through
*  the Gap, talking about this trek as if it's a vacation.
*  So I needed to make sense of this contradiction that I was seeing between this incredibly
*  harsh terrain, this idea that this place is an impassable jungle and these numbers that
*  we were seeing.
*  And so my colleague, Federico Rios, photographer, and I decided that the only way really to
*  do this was to do the trek ourselves.
*  And so we set out to cross the Darien Gap.
*  So tell us, Julie, about this journey.
*  So I started the journey in Nekocli, the beach town in Colombia that serves as the jumping
*  off point for the trip through the Darien.
*  So from Nekocli, the migrants have to cross this large body of water, this gulf, to get
*  to the point where the jungle begins.
*  And so I have to say, we were totally struck by the organization and the operation of the
*  entire thing.
*  These formerly tourist boat, now migrant boat companies, are calling the migrants one by
*  one to get on their assigned boat after they've bought their ticket.
*  So we get on this boat with a large group of migrants on their way to start this journey.
*  And we reach Caburganá, the last town before people enter the jungle.
*  So we are leaving now to begin this hike.
*  We're a group of maybe 100 people.
*  There's lots of children.
*  Everybody is completely laid in down with bags and mats to sleep on and things like
*  that.
*  So we set off for what would be, for most of these migrants, a journey of somewhere
*  between six and 10 days in the jungle.
*  And pretty soon, the terrain gets very steep.
*  And it's very hot.
*  It's very hot.
*  People are struggling.
*  They're breathing hard.
*  Some people start to cry.
*  And then it starts to get really difficult.
*  Right.
*  And somehow people are getting through this with children in their arms or on their backs.
*  Yes.
*  Lots of children.
*  Lots and lots of children.
*  Wow.
*  So by the time that we are two days in, we really start to see people fall apart.
*  They start to get sick.
*  They start to get injured.
*  There's a pregnant woman who we watch fall down an extremely steep hill.
*  And it becomes clear that some people aren't going to make this journey.
*  They're not going to survive.
*  We did come across a dead body on the trail.
*  Wow.
*  You often heard adults singing with kids just to keep their spirits up.
*  So by the fourth day, we have crossed into Panama.
*  We are about halfway through the journey.
*  And we're about to do the most difficult part of the trek, what is called the Hill of Death.
*  And it's on this hill that I meet Sarah.
*  How old are you?
*  Six.
*  And Sarah is...
*  Sarah is this tiny six-year-old girl from Venezuela.
*  She's wearing this tiny pink t-shirt with sparkles on it.
*  And she is climbing the Hill of Death with a man named Angel.
*  You are family?
*  We are friends.
*  Friends, okay.
*  He's not her father.
*  And I see Angel help Sarah to make it up and then down the Hill of Death.
*  We're going to camp between a couple of trees by the river.
*  Fede is making a clearing basically with a machete.
*  And, you know, as we're setting up camp for the night, I got to know Sarah a little bit more.
*  Earlier in the journey, Sarah's mother had then become injured and that morning had asked
*  if he could help her by carrying Sarah at points, by guiding her while she trudged along
*  in her injured state.
*  And by the time I met them, no one knew where her mother was.
*  It wasn't clear to us if she was even alive.
*  It really seemed to exemplify what a cruel journey this was, that a mother would be pushed,
*  some would say forced, to hand her child, the fate of her child, to someone she had
*  really just met, all in the hopes of making it through the Daring Gap and making it to
*  the United States.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So what happens the next morning?
*  So Sarah's group wakes up very early and they tell us that they are going to head out.
*  I asked Sarah for a description of her mother in case I saw her later that day and could
*  interview her, could tell her that Sarah was okay.
*  And I'm told that Sarah's mother looks exactly like her, same hair, same skin.
*  Sarah's group leaves and Fede and I decide we're going to wait and hope that we find
*  the mother.
*  And sure enough, a few hours later, a woman matching the description we were given comes
*  down the hill.
*  And I ask her, are you Sarah's mother?
*  And she exclaims and she wants to know it immediately if her daughter is okay.
*  By this point, it's been more than a day since she'd seen her only child.
*  They'd been on this journey for about six days so far.
*  Her name is Alexandra.
*  Sarah's mom tells me that she has terrible blisters on her feet.
*  So we sat down on a log by a river and I asked her what landed her here?
*  How did she get here?
*  Why is she here?
*  She told me she was a lawyer in Venezuela, but when the country's oil industry collapsed,
*  her business collapsed.
*  So earlier that year, she had left Venezuela, crossed on foot the Atacama Desert to make
*  it into Chile, where she thought that she could build a new life.
*  She couldn't practice law there because she didn't have the right paperwork.
*  And Alexandra tells me that she's under the impression that the U.S. will let her in and
*  let her stay in the country.
*  And this is where she wants to raise her daughter.
*  That's what brought her on this trek in the first place.
*  She's just horrified by the fact that she's become separated from her daughter.
*  She's horrified by what her daughter is going through.
*  So we say goodbye and I continued on, hoping that I might catch back up with Sarah and
*  tell her that her mother was alive and okay.
*  By this point, it's day seven.
*  We are exhausted, but Feli and I are still moving much faster than Alexandra and we think
*  we might be able to catch up with Sarah at the next camp.
*  So we're finally, finally arriving at a place called El Abuelo.
*  The next camp is a place called El Abuelo and as we settle in, I start scanning for Sarah.
*  And I spot Sarah and Angel and I immediately tell Sarah that I've met her mom, that she's
*  just a day or two behind.
*  And Angel tells me that since I last saw them, Sarah has been crying a lot.
*  She's been asking about her mom nonstop and as I'm talking to her, she's asking to wait
*  at this camp, to wait at El Abuelo for her mom to meet them there.
*  But Angel has decided that what they need to do is get to the end of the trek where
*  there's a government camp where children who have been separated along this journey can
*  stay until they are reunited with their parents.
*  So I tell them that I'm staying behind to do reporting and that Alexandra is probably
*  a day behind.
*  I know I can wait and try and connect with her at this camp.
*  So what happens next?
*  So we're waiting at El Abuelo.
*  I see this boat arrive.
*  Alexandra has just arrived on a boat.
*  Her feet are so destroyed that she can't walk.
*  She's like crying and she's shaking.
*  She hasn't eaten or had anything to drink in two days.
*  I tell her that I saw Sarah, that Sarah is just up ahead.
*  And all she wants to do is get moving immediately.
*  She doesn't want to eat.
*  She doesn't want to sleep.
*  She just wants to find her daughter.
*  And so we get in this boat to head toward the government UN camp together.
*  So this is Alexandra arriving at Canan, which is this community in Panama where her daughter
*  should be.
*  So we get off the boat.
*  As before, she needs to be carried.
*  She's scanning for her daughter.
*  And finally, she is taken by Panamanian officials to one of the shacks.
*  And there inside the shack is Sarah, is her daughter.
*  And we are watching this reunion happen.
*  And Alexandra just, you know, she grabs her daughter, she holds her, and she starts asking
*  for forgiveness right away.
*  Please forgive me.
*  Please forgive me.
*  You know, I didn't abandon you is what she says.
*  They had been separated now for three days.
*  Sarah seemed kind of to be in shock.
*  It was a very bittersweet reunion because they hadn't even made it near the United
*  States.
*  They still had so much more to do.
*  After the break, Julie Turkowitz gives us an update on what Alexandra and Sarah are
*  now doing.
*  This is Julie Turkowitz, Andy's bureau chief.
*  Since this episode aired, my colleague Federico Rios and I have kept in touch with Alexandra.
*  After Alexandra and Sarah crossed the Daring Gap, they continued their journey north to
*  try and get to the United States.
*  And as they were traveling through Central America, they heard that the Biden administration
*  had made a really important policy change.
*  The new policy would no longer allow Venezuelans to enter at the Mexico-U.S. border.
*  Instead, the government was going to open up slots for Venezuelans in a program called
*  humanitarian parole.
*  And it was going to give them a safe legal way to get into the United States.
*  So Alexandra decides that she has just suffered too much.
*  She does not want to risk her daughter's life anymore on any other part of the journey.
*  And she's going to apply for this legal option.
*  She just has one problem.
*  And that's that for the humanitarian parole program, you need to have a person in the
*  United States who says, hey, I commit to supporting this person even financially when they get
*  to the United States.
*  And then the article comes out and we had a huge, huge response from New York Times
*  readers, several of whom reached out and said, we want to be the sponsors.
*  And they submitted applications for this humanitarian parole program.
*  So now we are more than a year later.
*  All Alexandra has heard from the U.S. government is that it has been received and she wakes
*  up every morning, checks the status of her application and refreshes and refreshes, hoping
*  that one day it will say that her application has been accepted and that she will be able
*  to come to the United States.
*  Meantime, they are in a pretty unstable situation.
*  They've asked us not to reveal their specific location.
*  They are in a situation of poverty and Alexandra really tries to maintain hope.
*  In the time since the episode aired, I have also been speaking with Angel.
*  Angel is the man who helped Sarah when she lost her mother in the jungle.
*  He took a very different path and he decided to continue on to the United States.
*  He eventually made it to Pennsylvania.
*  He got a work permit and a social security number, and now he's making $140 a day as
*  a mechanic.
*  And you know, life is difficult.
*  His family is now broken apart, but he feels that in the U.S., making this amount of money,
*  he can deliver on what he set out to do.
*  And this is what made him cross the Darién.
*  He can help his child back home and he can fulfill what he sees as his duties as a father.
*  So last year, when we were with Alexandra and Sarah, 248,000 people crossed the Darién
*  Gap.
*  That was a record annual high.
*  This year, we are about to hit 500,000 people crossing this jungle.
*  The word is out that the Darién Gap is this treacherous pathway to the United States.
*  And you see large numbers of Ecuadorians, of people from China, people from Afghanistan
*  taking this route and they are fleeing economic instability, political instability, conflict,
*  war.
*  It's not that they don't know that the Darién Gap is dangerous.
*  It's that many of them are making the calculation that the potential reward is worth the risk.
