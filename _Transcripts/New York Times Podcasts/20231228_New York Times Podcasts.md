*  Hey, it's Michael.
*  This week, the Daily is revisiting some of our favorite episodes of the year, listening
*  back, and hearing what's happened in the time since they first ran.
*  Today, we return to a mother and daughter who, along with hundreds of thousands of others,
*  made a harrowing journey through the Darian gap, and we find out where they ended up.
*  It's Thursday, December 28th.
*  Julie, tell us what we should know about this place, the Darian gap.
*  So the Darian gap is this narrow sliver of land between Columbia and Panama, connects
*  south and central Americas, and this slip of land is a jungle, and it's an extremely
*  inhospitable jungle.
*  And this is because the territory is sheer mountains, intense, intense mud, to be able to traverse
*  it on foot is very dangerous because there are deadly animals, bugs, snakes, fast-running
*  rivers.
*  Wow.
*  And it's sort of a changing territory too because it's incredibly wet.
*  This place has no road.
*  So for years, what you saw was that a small number of migrants who sort of heard word of
*  mouth about the possibility of crossing that they could do it were braving this trek.
*  And so you saw between 2010 and 2020 an average of under 11,000 people crossing a year.
*  What you've seen in the last two years is an enormous historic rise in people crossing
*  this very dangerous, in many cases, deadly jungle.
*  How many more people?
*  Well, we saw in 2022 was almost 250,000 people cross the Darian gap.
*  And what explains why so many people are trying to take this treacherous journey right
*  now?
*  So first of all, the pandemic really hit economies in South America hard.
*  And because the crisis was region wide, this left one way out.
*  And that way out was north through the Darian gap.
*  And so we see traffickers advertising on social media, encouraging people to come through
*  the gap, talking about this trek as if it's a vacation.
*  So I needed to make sense of this contradiction that I was seeing between this incredibly
*  harsh terrain, this idea that this place is an impassable jungle.
*  And these numbers that we were seeing.
*  And so my colleague Ferre, Ferre Gouríos photographer, and I decided that the only way really
*  to do this was to do the trek ourselves.
*  And so we set out to cross the Darian gap.
*  So tell us, Julie, about this journey.
*  So I started the journey in Nicol Clee, the beach town in Colombia that serves as the
*  jumping off point for the trip through the Darian.
*  So from Nicol Clee, the migrants have to cross this large body of water, this gulf, to
*  get to the point where the jungle begins.
*  And so I have to say, we were totally struck by the organization and the operation of the
*  entire thing.
*  Daniel José Múñol.
*  These formerly tourist boat, now migrant boat companies, are calling the migrants one by
*  one to get on their assigned boat after they've bought their ticket.
*  So we get on this boat with a large group of migrants on their way to start this journey.
*  And we reach Caburganá, the last town before people enter the jungle.
*  So we are leaving now to begin this hike.
*  We're a group of maybe 100 people.
*  There's lots of children.
*  And everybody is completely laid in down with bags and mats to sleep on and things like
*  that.
*  So we set off for what would be, for most of these migrants, a journey of somewhere
*  between six and ten days in the jungle.
*  And pretty soon the terrain gets very steep and it's very hot.
*  People are struggling, they're breathing hard, some people start to cry.
*  And then it starts to get really difficult.
*  Right.
*  And somehow people are getting through this with children and their arms are on their
*  backs.
*  Yes.
*  Lots of children.
*  Lots and lots of children.
*  Wow.
*  So by the time that we are two days in, we really start to see people fall apart.
*  They start to get sick.
*  They start to get injured.
*  There's a pregnant woman who we watch fall down an extremely steep hill.
*  And it becomes clear that some people aren't going to make this journey.
*  They're not going to survive.
*  We did come across a dead body on the trail.
*  You often heard adults singing with kids just to keep their spirits up.
*  So by the fourth day we have crossed into Panama.
*  We are about halfway through the journey and we're about to do the most difficult part
*  of the track, what is called the Hill of Death.
*  How do you call it?
*  I call it Sara.
*  And it's on this hill that I meet Sara.
*  Sara is this tiny six year old girl from Venezuela.
*  She's wearing this tiny pink t-shirt with sparkles on it.
*  And she is climbing the Hill of Death with a man named Angel.
*  He's not her father.
*  And I see Angel helps Sara to make it up and then down the Hill of Death.
*  We're going to camp between a couple of trees by the river.
*  Fele is making a clearing basically with a machete.
*  And you know, as we're setting up camp for the night, I got to know Sara a little bit more.
*  These friends are friends of the route.
*  Earlier in the journey, Sara's mother had then become injured and that morning had asked
*  Angel if he could help her by carrying Sara at points, by guiding her while she trudged
*  along in her injured state.
*  And by the time I met them, no one knew where her mother was.
*  It wasn't clear to us if she was even alive.
*  It really seemed to exemplify what a cruel journey this was that a mother would be pushed
*  some would say forced to hand her child the fate of her child to someone she had really
*  just met all in the hopes of making it through the Daringab and making it to the United States.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So what happens the next morning?
*  So Sara's group wakes up very early and they tell us that they are going to head out.
*  I asked Sara for a description of her mother in case I saw her leader that day and could
*  interview her could tell her that Sara was okay.
*  And I'm told that Sara's mother looks exactly like her same hair, same skin.
*  Sara's group leaves and Feh and I decide we are going to wait and hope that we find
*  the mother.
*  And sure enough, a few hours later, a woman matching the description we were given comes
*  down the hill.
*  And I asked her, are you Sara's mother?
*  And she exclaims and wants to know it immediately if her daughter is okay.
*  By this point it's been more than a day since she'd seen her only child.
*  They'd been on this journey for about six days so far.
*  Her name is Alexandra.
*  Sara's mom tells me that she has terrible blisters on her feet.
*  So we sat down on the log by a river and I asked her what landed here.
*  How did she get here?
*  Why is she here?
*  She told me she was a lawyer in Venezuela but when the country's oil industry collapsed,
*  her business collapsed.
*  So earlier that year she had left Venezuela crossed on foot the Atacama desert to make
*  it into Chile where she thought that she could build a new life.
*  But she couldn't practice law there because she didn't have the right paperwork.
*  And Alexandra tells me that she's under the impression that the U.S. will let her in and
*  let her stay in the country.
*  And this is where she wants to raise her daughter.
*  That's what brought her on this track in the first place.
*  She's just horrified by the fact that she's become separated from her daughter.
*  She's horrified about what her daughter is going through.
*  So we say goodbye and I continue on hoping that I might catch back up with Sara and tell
*  her that her mother was alive and okay.
*  By this point it's day seven.
*  We are exhausted but Feli and I are still moving much faster than Alexandra and we think
*  we might be able to catch up with Sara at the next camp.
*  So we're finally arriving in a place called El Auello.
*  The next camp is a place called El Auello and as we settle in I start scanning for Sara.
*  And I spot Sara and Anhil and I immediately tell Sara that I've met her mom that she's
*  just a day or two behind.
*  And Anhil tells me that since I last saw them Sara has been crying a lot.
*  She's been asking about her mom nonstop and as I'm talking to her she's asking to wait
*  at this camp to wait at El Auello for her mom to meet them there.
*  But Anhil has decided what they need to do is get to the end of the trek where there's
*  a government camp where children who have been separated along this journey can stay until
*  they are reunited with their parents.
*  So I tell them that I'm staying behind to do reporting and that Alexandra is probably
*  a day behind.
*  I know I can wait and try and connect with her at this camp.
*  So what happens next?
*  So we are waiting in El Auello.
*  I see this boat arrive.
*  Alexandra has just arrived on boat.
*  Her feet are so destroyed that she can't walk.
*  She's like crying and she's shaking.
*  She hasn't eaten or had anything to drink in two days.
*  I tell her that I saw Sara that Sara is just up ahead.
*  And all she wants to do is get moving immediately.
*  She doesn't want to eat.
*  She doesn't want to sleep.
*  She doesn't want to rest.
*  She just wants to find her daughter.
*  So we get in this boat to head toward the government, UN camp together.
*  So this is Alexandra arriving at Kanan, which is this community in Panama where her daughter
*  should be.
*  So we get off the boat as before she needs to be carried.
*  She's scanning for her daughter.
*  And finally, she is taken by Panamanian officials to one of the Shaks.
*  And there inside the Shaks is Sara, is her daughter.
*  And we are watching this reunion happen.
*  And Alexandra just, you know, she grabs her daughter.
*  She holds her.
*  And she starts asking for forgiveness right away.
*  Please forgive me, please forgive me.
*  You know, I didn't abandon you as what she says.
*  They have been separated now.
*  For three days, Sara seemed kind of to be in shock.
*  It was a very bit of a sweet reunion because they hadn't even made it near the United States.
*  They still had so much more to do.
*  After the break, Julie Turkowitz gives us an update on what Alexandra and Sara are now
*  doing.
*  This is Julie Turkowitz, Andy's bureau chief.
*  Since this episode aired, my colleague, Federico Rios and I have kept in touch with Alexandra.
*  After Alexandra and Sara crossed Daringab, they continued their journey north to try and
*  get to the United States.
*  And as they were traveling through Central America, they heard that the Biden administration
*  had made a really important policy change.
*  The new policy would no longer allow Venezuelans to enter at the Mexico-US border.
*  Instead, the government was going to open up slots for Venezuelans in a program called
*  Humanitarian Parole.
*  And it was going to give them a safe legal way to get into the United States.
*  So Alexandra decides that she has just suffered too much.
*  She does not want to risk her daughter's life anymore on any other part of the journey.
*  And she is going to apply for this legal option.
*  She just has one problem.
*  And that's that for the Humanitarian Parole program, you need to have a person in the
*  United States who says, hey, I commit to supporting this person even financially when they get
*  to the United States.
*  And then the article comes out.
*  And we had a huge, huge response from New York Times readers, several of whom reached out
*  and said, we want to be the sponsors.
*  And they submitted applications for this Humanitarian Parole program.
*  So now we are more than a year later.
*  All Alexandra has heard from the US government is that it has been received.
*  And she wakes up every morning, checks the status of her application and refreshes and
*  refreshes, hoping that one day it will say that her application has been accepted and that
*  she will be able to come to the United States.
*  Meantime, they are in a pretty unstable situation.
*  They've asked us not to reveal their specific location.
*  They are in a situation of poverty.
*  And Alexandra really tries to maintain hope.
*  In the time since the episode aired, I have also been speaking with Anhell.
*  Anhell is the man who helped Sarah when she lost her mother in the jungle.
*  He took a very different path and he decided to continue on to the United States.
*  He eventually made it to Pennsylvania.
*  He got a work permit and a social security number.
*  And now he's making $140 a day as a mechanic.
*  And you know, life is difficult.
*  His family is now broken apart.
*  And he feels it in the US, making this amount of money.
*  He can deliver on what he set out to do.
*  And this is what made him cross the dairy.
*  He can help his child back home and he can fulfill what he sees as his duties as a father.
*  So last year when we were with Alexandra and Sarah, 248,000 people crossed the dairy
*  and gap.
*  That was a record annual high.
*  This year we are about to hit 500,000 people crossing this jungle.
*  The word is out that the dairy and gap is this treacherous pathway to the United States.
*  And you see large numbers of Ecuadorians, of people from China, people from Afghanistan
*  taking this route.
*  And they are fleeing economic instability, political instability, conflict, war.
*  It's not that they don't know that the dairy and gap is dangerous.
*  It's that many of them are making the calculation that the potential reward is worth the risk.
