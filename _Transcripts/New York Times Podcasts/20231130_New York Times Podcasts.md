# The Bad Vibes Around a Good Economy
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAqRvnBbwNY)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  The American economy, by many measures, is doing better than it's done in years.
*  But for many Americans, that's not how it feels.
*  I mean, I get comments from people all the time that I could stretch a dollar like no
*  one else, and even now I'm struggling to do it.
*  Yeah, when I'm talking about inflation, I'm mostly talking about the cost of groceries.
*  The food used to be like $1.89 a gallon.
*  It's now $2.89.
*  I'm like, thank God I'm lactose intolerant.
*  Their feeling is pointing to an enduring economic mystery.
*  Why do Americans feel so bad when the economy is so good?
*  We're kind of just struggling in what's left of the middle class.
*  Today, my colleague Gina Smilich, on a new way to understand the disconnect.
*  It's Thursday, November 30th.
*  So Gina, we're going to talk today about the economy and how, despite the fact that
*  it's doing quite well, Americans are feeling pretty badly about it.
*  So, you know, this is a puzzle we spent some time on the show already thinking about.
*  Two years ago, we did a show with our colleague Ben Castleman.
*  At the time, the economy was still really emerging from the pandemic.
*  Inflation was really high.
*  And the thinking at the time was, you know, this is a temporary thing.
*  Americans feel badly about the economy, but it will pass.
*  Two years later, here we are.
*  The economy is actually doing better, but people feel bad still.
*  So help us understand what's going on here.
*  Right.
*  So like you said, this is a pretty confusing situation.
*  Overall, we're actually seeing some pretty decent looking economic indicators,
*  at least by the economic indicators we sort of traditionally look at.
*  You know, we're in a situation where inflation has come down quite a bit.
*  You know, we saw a peak at above 9% in the sort of summer of 2022.
*  But now we're down at like 3%, a little bit above 3%.
*  We've seen unemployment come down pretty sharply to historically pretty low level.
*  Wage growth has been pretty solid recently.
*  It's actually beating inflation a little bit in recent months.
*  And yet despite all of this, people still seem to be feeling really bad.
*  So how bad exactly are people feeling?
*  Like what's the damage in terms of the sentiment here?
*  So one good way to get a sense of that is to look at the University of Michigan
*  consumer confidence numbers.
*  These are sort of the baseline of how people are feeling about the economy.
*  And they give that number as an index.
*  In February 2020, so headed into the pandemic, we had a pretty good economy.
*  And the index level was at 101.
*  During the worst part of the pandemic, that level dropped to the low 70s.
*  It's now actually at 63.8.
*  So down even from the sort of worst part of the pandemic.
*  That is pretty remarkable and also very perplexing.
*  So let's start to unpack this, Gina.
*  What is going on here?
*  So I think that what is pretty clear is that the traditional measures we look at to try
*  and gauge the economy and how we think people should be feeling about the economy
*  are not really telling us the full story here.
*  And so it's sort of incumbent upon us as reporters to sort of look for other explanations
*  and try to understand why people feel so bad at a time when the data look good
*  and consumers are still spending.
*  So we did a couple of things.
*  We talked to a lot of people.
*  We looked at a lot of polls.
*  And we basically came up with three numbers that we think explain what might be going on here.
*  So what are they?
*  Give me the first one.
*  So I think one number that helps to explain this disconnect is 20%.
*  And that's how much consumer prices overall are up since late 2019.
*  So this is inflation.
*  Exactly.
*  Inflation, but sort of a four-year aggregate inflation,
*  which is not traditionally the way we think about that number,
*  but I think is useful for thinking about this moment in inflation.
*  And can you translate that for me, Gina, the four-year aggregate number?
*  Yeah.
*  So it means that over the last four years, the total consumer shopping basket,
*  everything we buy, is up by about 20%.
*  The reason that matters is because it's a much quicker pace of acceleration than we're used to.
*  It means that people still remember a time when prices were about a fifth lower,
*  and yet they are facing these considerably higher prices today.
*  And so I think of it as sticker shock inflation.
*  Even though day-to-day price increases have really slowed down recently,
*  even though inflation numbers are looking a lot better,
*  people are still experiencing these much higher price levels
*  because we've had so much inflation since the pandemic.
*  And so I think that is explaining part of our disconnect here.
*  So Gina, let's just take an example of something where people are having that sticker shock.
*  So I think a good one to use, because it's something that's really salient for consumers,
*  is gas.
*  If you were buying a 15-gallon tank of gas at the start of 2020,
*  it would have run you something in the range of $38.
*  Now, if you're buying the same 15-gallon tank of gas, it would run you about $49.
*  And so that's a pretty dramatic increase, and people really feel that.
*  Gas doesn't have a lot to do with any government policy.
*  It's because of a bunch of global forces that those prices move.
*  But that doesn't mean people don't respond to it.
*  It's something that people see in their everyday lives.
*  Another thing that people pay a lot of attention to is the price of food.
*  And if you look at food at home, which is basically groceries,
*  those prices are up nearly 26% compared to late 2019.
*  26%?
*  Yeah, 26%.
*  So if you're driving, if you're paying for food,
*  if you're trying to buy these sort of very basics of life, they're a lot more expensive.
*  So bottom line, prices are still too damn high, right?
*  And it's a shock when you go into the gas station or the grocery store.
*  So what is your next measure?
*  How else should we understand this?
*  So my next number is 47%.
*  That's how much home prices have risen nationally since late 2019,
*  based on data from this company called S&P Case Schiller.
*  47%?
*  It's a lot, right?
*  Oh my god, Gina.
*  I mean, it kind of is something you know from just being in the world that housing prices are high,
*  but the actual number is breathtaking.
*  Yeah, so I think what this means for people on the ground, and particularly young people,
*  is that it's just a lot bigger of a lift to purchase that first home than it previously was.
*  That's especially true because mortgage rates are a lot higher than they used to be.
*  They're hovering around 7.3% right now because of the Fed's interest rate increases.
*  And then I think it's also true because if you're not already owning a house,
*  you are likely renting.
*  And if you're renting in America right now,
*  that too has gotten a lot more expensive since the pandemic.
*  And so I think between mortgage rates and the rent situation and housing prices,
*  some people that we talk to feel like they're on this sort of hamster wheel,
*  where it's just harder and harder to sort of achieve the trappings of the American dream.
*  So this is just this huge economic problem,
*  precisely at the moment when people expect to be crossing the threshold into adulthood.
*  Makes sense why people would feel disaffected with the economy right now if you're in that situation.
*  And I think that it's being exacerbated by a couple of other really big ticket items
*  that are also sort of what you can think of as sort of American dream items.
*  We've seen the cost of cars go up a lot and it costs a lot more to finance a car purchase.
*  And we've also seen that student loan payments have resumed.
*  Those were temporarily paused because of the pandemic,
*  but I think people got pretty used to not paying those back.
*  And so we've now got this trifecta of really big expenses, housing, cars, and college.
*  And they're all kind of eating into the household budget around the same time.
*  Right. And this is particularly salient for young people.
*  They see all of these big ticket items completely out of reach and are feeling pretty despondent.
*  Right. And we're definitely picking up on that negativity,
*  whether for this reason or for other reasons, in the polls.
*  And so a recent New York Times-Santa College poll found that 59% of voters under 30
*  in key swing states rated the economy as poor,
*  which is substantially higher than you see in basically any other age group.
*  And you can definitely see that playing out in some of the forums
*  where young people are really active, like social media.
*  Which leads us to the third thing I want to talk to you about.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Jeannie, you just told me that the next number to really explain
*  why people feel so bad about the economy, despite it being so good,
*  has something to do with social media. So tell me about that.
*  Yes. So the number here is 43%, which is the share of TikTok users who say that they are
*  getting their news on that platform. Okay. So TikTok, big social media platform,
*  43% of people who use that actually get all of their news on that.
*  Yeah. And that's about twice what that number was just a couple of years ago.
*  And I think it fits into this broader ecosystem because based on research from Pew,
*  we're seeing that something like 50% of adults are getting their news or some news from social
*  media in general. The reason that that's so interesting is that a lot of what we see perform
*  really well on social media, when it comes to economy and finance news, is really, really negative.
*  So for the sake of journalism, I spent a few days recently just sort of flipping through social
*  media channels. I spent a day just kind of watching TikTok videos on the economy.
*  And I saw a couple of consistent themes or consistent tropes coming up over and over again.
*  I genuinely hope within my lifetime, I witnessed the collapse of capitalism.
*  You get a lot of videos sort of questioning the whole system.
*  Someone explained to me how this just cost me over $70 at the grocery store. I got like 15 things.
*  What used to be a maybe 50, $60 trip, $109. You get a lot of videos kind of-
*  Prices are outrageous. And I don't even know how people afford homes. It literally keeps me up at
*  night fatalistically talking about how people are never going to be able to afford a house.
*  Ever in my life, not with the economy the way it is.
*  When I was your age, I already owned a house. Yeah, because it cost $6.
*  Your down payment couldn't buy a Frosty at an airport Wendy's today.
*  I think that's interesting because it clearly reflects how people are feeling about the economy.
*  You know, those are the things people are choosing to like and to reshare and to sort of spread
*  around. But it also means that that negative content is what's getting disseminated and
*  potentially sort of influencing how people think about the world around them.
*  Right. And the negativity really amplifies those bad feelings, right? It's like the lighter fluid
*  on the embers. It just makes everybody feel worse and it makes it bigger.
*  Yeah. So one trend that I saw a lot of was the set of videos that really kind of took
*  off a couple of months ago. We are absolutely living in a silent
*  depression. A silent depression.
*  Which play on the term, quote unquote, silent depression.
*  You know how I know it's a silent depression right now? Because our government doesn't even
*  act like there's anything wrong with the economy. So the sort of conceit behind these videos is
*  people film themselves talking about the economy and making comparisons about the affordability
*  of things like houses or gas now versus in 1930s during the Great Depression era, hence the silent
*  depression title. Very difficult time in the American economy.
*  Exactly. We are living in the silent depression and I'm going to explain what I mean. New cars
*  are unaffordable. New houses are unaffordable. To move to a new place and rent somewhere else
*  is unaffordable. And so the point of these videos is to look at the cost of things and basically to
*  say, how many years would you have to work and save every cent that you are making to buy a house
*  or a car? And the upshot is that you'd have to work longer in 2023 to buy those things than you
*  would have in 1930. Is that right? So it is definitely the case that affordability
*  for really big purchases like housing has gotten worse over the decades. That said,
*  there are two really big problems with these videos. Problem number one is that the data
*  they're using is not very good. We tend to rely on government data for numbers like this and
*  those figures start around 1940. I did try and fact check one of the more popular videos in this
*  vein and when I asked for the sources, a lot of them were kind of random numbers just strewn
*  across the internet. And so I don't think that these are pulling from particularly reliable
*  statistics. Okay. So it sounds like this idea of silent depression is real for people, but the
*  numbers people are sharing in these posts to explain it are off. Yes. So beyond the data problem,
*  we've got the second problem, which is that these posts miss an incredibly important caveat in the
*  sense that the economy is so much stronger now than it was in the 1930s. And so it's not a
*  reasonable time period to compare 2023 to. These videos may be powerful, they may strike people as
*  compelling, but they are not accurate. I think that's an important point to make here. But I
*  think what is really relevant here is that these videos are resonating with people. There's a
*  reason they're going viral. And I think what we can take away from this is that people find
*  this argument that it's become harder to afford the trappings of everyday life to be something
*  that sort of resonates with their economic experience. Okay. So this might be a pretty
*  misleading comparison. Like the context is wrong, but it's tapping into something that's emotional
*  and therefore powerful. Yeah. So this is the interesting thing about social media in the
*  context of sort of economic information. I talked to some media experts and they basically say that
*  we can't tell for sure at this stage. We just don't have the data. But it's possible that sort
*  of the environment and the conversation that's happening on social media not only reflects how
*  people feel, but could actually potentially help to drive it. And so I think that's why this is such
*  an interesting thing to keep an eye on, the sort of tone of the conversation here, both to understand
*  why people are saying what they're saying or thinking what they're thinking, but also to think
*  about how those perceptions are being shaped. So social media itself is actually forming this
*  negativity and the negative view of the economy, right? So it's not just like a mirror reflecting
*  it back. It's actually convincing people that things are bad. We can't say that for sure,
*  but it could be. Hence your third indicator. Exactly. So Gina, stepping back here, your new
*  measures are pretty persuasive. You know, this isn't a case of economists being right and Americans
*  being wrong. Americans are taking cues from their own lives and what they're seeing are financial
*  obstacles that feel pretty insurmountable. And that translates into feeling down about the economy,
*  right? But I guess the question in my mind now is what will it take for people to feel good about
*  the economy? Right. So I think that we are seeing some attempts at policy responses that could help
*  around the edges here. You know, student loans are a good example. We know that people feel bad about
*  the fact that they have to pay back those student loans, but the Biden administration has taken
*  efforts to either make fewer people have to pay back their student loans or make sure that those
*  payback plans and schedules are less onerous than they previously were. So there's some things around
*  the edges that you can do like that. I think there are some things that you can't do that you hear
*  from people they would like to see, but that don't actually work in economic terms. A big one is what
*  economists call deflation, which is a fancy way to say actually bringing price levels down.
*  And how would that work? Yeah. So when you talk to households, they will often say, well, I really
*  wish that the prices of the things I buy every day would just fall, you know, and that's what
*  I'm waiting for. And the reason that can't happen, the reason you don't want deflation in an economy
*  as counterintuitive as that feels is if prices fall across the economy, then you and I are going
*  to stop spending our money. We're going to wait. We're not going to buy that, you know, t-shirt that
*  we want or that latte that we want. We're going to wait till next week when it's cheaper. And if
*  everybody across the whole economy is doing that simultaneously, it's going to grind the economy to
*  stand still. We're all going to get fired because nobody's going to be buying the things that we
*  produce at our jobs. And then everything's a disaster. So you don't want deflation. Deflation
*  is terrible for the economy. So then is this sourness about the economy permanent? Is this
*  the new normal? Because your numbers seem to be, you know, these big ticket items that are really
*  at the center of people's lives. They seem more like really enduring features of the economy than
*  temporary blips. You know, I really think it's an open question. So these are three trends that we
*  decided to look at because they seem like part of the conversation, but it could be that these aren't
*  even the right ones, that something else is the thing that is pulling confidence down. And whatever
*  it is could worsen or dissipate. You know, it's just a very uncertain moment. I think that part
*  of what is going to be important here is waiting to see if this sort of resolves over time. One
*  thing that we can definitively say is that we've already got some glimmers of hope.
*  You know, since the sort of peak of the inflation in summer 2022, consumer confidence has picked up a
*  little bit. It has gotten better than it was at its very worst. And so it could be the case that
*  people just need time to get used to higher price levels, to realize that inflation is fading, to
*  sort of get used to sort of a new normal with slightly higher prices, and that consumer
*  confidence will sort of readjust as that happens.
*  So basically to wait for people to adjust to this new normal.
*  Exactly. It could just take a while.
*  Gina, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. In Arizona on Wednesday, two Republican county supervisors
*  were indicted on felony charges related to their attempts to delay the certification of the 2022
*  election. The officials, Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby, were charged with conspiracy and
*  interference with an election officer after they ordered a hand count of ballots citing conspiracy
*  theories that had been raised by local right-wing activists. Arizona's attorney general characterized
*  their actions as, quote, repeated attempts to undermine our democracy.
*  And Henry Kissinger, one of the most consequential statesmen in American history,
*  who advised 12 presidents, died on Wednesday at the age of 100. Kissinger, who was from a German
*  Jewish refugee family, was the most powerful U.S. secretary of state in the post-war era.
*  He engineered America's opening to China, negotiated its exit from the Vietnam War,
*  and remade America's relationship with the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War. He was hailed
*  as an ultra-realist who reshaped diplomacy to better serve American interests. But he was also
*  reviled at having abandoned American values, particularly in the area of human rights, if he
*  thought it served the nation's purposes. Today's episode was produced by Shannon Lin, Mary Wilson,
