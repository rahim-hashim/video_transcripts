# The Shadowy Story of Oppenheimer and Congress
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvftk_W5Y-s)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Ternese, and this is The Daily.
*  Hollywood's awards season is officially underway.
*  Just the beginning of the fun and glamour of awards season.
*  Nominations for the Academy Awards, one of Hollywood's biggest events, will be announced
*  today.
*  I think we had a Barbenheimer summer.
*  Oh, did we?
*  It was so much fun.
*  Listen, Oppenheimer should lead the way.
*  Oppenheimer right now is the movie to beat for the Oscars.
*  And one movie that's expected to collect a lot is Oppenheimer, about the father of
*  the atomic bomb.
*  The film captured the imagination of millions of people last summer, including our congressional
*  correspondent, Katie Edmondson.
*  Today, Katie describes how Oppenheimer sent her on a quest to find the secret story of
*  how Congress paid for the bomb.
*  And what that reveals about the inner workings of Washington.
*  It's Tuesday, January 23rd.
*  Katie, you cover Congress for the Times, as our listeners, of course, know.
*  But you join us today to talk about something a little out of the ordinary.
*  A story which many of our listeners may not immediately associate with a Times congressional
*  reporter.
*  And it has everything to do with the blockbuster movie Oppenheimer.
*  So tell us how you ended up reporting this very unusual story.
*  That's right.
*  Well, it all started really when I went to go see Oppenheimer, like I'm assuming a lot
*  of our listeners did over the summer.
*  I was actually working in Berlin.
*  I thought that I would get a little break from covering Congress.
*  I knew that there was going to be a big spending fight in the fall.
*  And I was kind of anxious to focus on something else for a little bit.
*  And so I went to this movie.
*  We're at war, Hans.
*  Which is, of course, about J. Robert Oppenheimer.
*  Now, let's calculate how much more destructive it would have been if it were a nuclear and
*  not a chemical reaction.
*  And the creation of the atomic bomb.
*  Expressing power in terms of tons of TNT.
*  But it would be thousands.
*  Well then, kilotons.
*  And the movie takes place, or a lot of it takes place, in Los Alamos.
*  Physics out of New Mexico, huh?
*  My God.
*  Which is this base that Oppenheimer and the military built up out of the desert, really
*  out of nothing.
*  This way, gentlemen.
*  This huge sprawling base where scientists from across the country came to figure out
*  how to build the bomb.
*  Dr. Lawrence.
*  Can I sleep?
*  They had homes for the families of the scientists there.
*  There's no kitchen.
*  Really?
*  What was that?
*  And something that I couldn't stop thinking about while these scenes were flashing on
*  screen was, this looks really expensive.
*  Did Congress approve the money for that?
*  And if so, how much were they told?
*  Because another big theme of this movie was that this was a very secret project, that
*  the number of people who knew about what was really happening at Los Alamos was extremely
*  restricted.
*  And so I was thinking, if that was true, how do you get Congress to approve what has to
*  be a huge tranche of money to fund this thing?
*  It was very much an intrusive thought that kept poking in throughout the movie.
*  Katie, you were in Berlin so that you weren't having to cover Congress, but yet there you
*  were, your head was back in Congress.
*  You can take the girl out of Congress, but...
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's a little embarrassing.
*  So then what do you do?
*  Well, I kind of just assumed that if I started Googling it, that I would come to some sort
*  of quick answer.
*  There's been so much research and so much academic work done on this period.
*  And I was surprised to find that there really wasn't that much.
*  There were a few lines on Wikipedia.
*  I ended up finding a textbook that gave a sort of brief version of how Congress had
*  sort of surreptitiously approved money in a bill.
*  It was at the behest of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
*  And as I was reading just these few kind of breadcrumbs, I just kept thinking, what do
*  you mean?
*  What do you mean Congress secretly passed this money and not a lot of people knew about
*  it?
*  Because look, this is my job currently is to go through the spending bills, to look
*  for things that are peculiar.
*  I also know that lawmakers are really bad at keeping secrets generally.
*  And so the idea that this happened, this huge secret was smuggled through Congress
*  without really anyone knowing, I just didn't see how that could be true.
*  And this is not just like some dumb bridge or a road or something, right?
*  It was a whole different scale.
*  Like it was ushering in the dawn of the atomic age.
*  Well, that's right.
*  And beyond the implications of the creation of this weapon of mass destruction, there's
*  also the cost, right?
*  The amount of money that Congress ultimately was asked to pass secretly was $800 million
*  for this project, which in today's money is about $13 billion.
*  And so every time I picked up on another little breadcrumb like this, I just became more incredulous.
*  Essentially, I wanted to understand even more how they were able to pull this off.
*  And so I pitched to my editor, well, why don't I do like, it'll be a fun historical memo
*  that I'll write about this.
*  And she agreed to let me do that.
*  And so that really set off this kind of obsessive search to figure out the answer of exactly
*  how Congress was able to secretly pass $800 million for the atomic bomb.
*  Katie, I love your nerdiness.
*  So what did that obsessive search look like?
*  Like, where did you start?
*  Well, at this point, I was back in DC.
*  I'd come back from Berlin, and this ended up becoming very much a side project because
*  there was actually a lot of spending drama happening here in DC in real time that I was
*  having to cover.
*  Of course.
*  But it took me through the digital archives of a lot of different libraries, former President
*  Roosevelt's archives.
*  And so it just kept happening that you would kind of get close to some sort of answer,
*  sort of document that seemed like it would unlock the secret of this and you would get
*  a few pieces.
*  But I was particularly obsessed with trying to get the account of one of the lawmakers
*  who was physically in the room when these discussions were happening, who was in the
*  room when the decision was made, because to me that was just going to give me the most
*  direct, the sharpest perspective of exactly how this worked.
*  Right.
*  So I had a list of the seven lawmakers who were brought into this secret.
*  I knew that one of the lawmakers in one of these secret meetings was Sam Rayburn, who
*  was the Speaker of the House at the time in 1944, considered one of the most famous, one
*  of the most legendary House speakers of all time.
*  And so I contacted the library where his papers are kept in Austin, Texas.
*  And I found out that those documents have not been digitized.
*  They were sitting in folders, in boxes.
*  And so I struck up an acquaintance with a reference intern there, a very intrepid man
*  named Dion Kaufman, who I'm so indebted to him for this because I kept saying, well,
*  what about this folder and what about that folder?
*  And he would go and he would look and it just did not yield anything.
*  But at least I could sort of rest knowing that someone had physically caged through
*  those folders.
*  So I was still looking for a lawmaker in the room.
*  And then I found that one of them, Senator Elmer Thomas of Oklahoma, who had been invited
*  to a secret briefing in the Senate about this whole gambit, had actually written a memoir.
*  Okay, so I've never heard of Elmer Thomas from Oklahoma or of his memoir.
*  How bad is that?
*  No, it's not.
*  I hadn't either.
*  But it turns out he was actually a pretty important guy on Capitol Hill at the time
*  when this all happened.
*  He was the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that oversaw military spending.
*  And so he was one of just a few lawmakers who were brought into this secret.
*  And it turns out his memoir, 40 years a legislator, perhaps unsurprisingly, was not in wide circulation.
*  Really?
*  But I did learn that there was a copy actually at the Library of Congress.
*  So I got my Library of Congress library card.
*  And on a quiet day, I went over there actually tunnels that connect the Capitol building
*  to the Library of Congress.
*  I kept getting lost.
*  And so around the third time that I was trying to find the room where this book was, I was
*  thinking, like, this is a lot of time now that I'm spending on this book that
*  Your editor is basically tapping her foot.
*  Yeah, may or may not be helpful.
*  But I finally got the book.
*  I opened it up and it was all there.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Katie, what was the story you ultimately pieced together?
*  I mean, how did they hide the building of the atomic bomb in the budget?
*  So here's what I learned.
*  Initially, the way that Roosevelt officials were getting the money for the research to
*  create the bomb was they were actually just taking money that Congress had appropriated
*  under different lied items and they were funneling it to the Manhattan Project.
*  Got it.
*  So skimming from other things, basically.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  But by 1944, looking through the documents, it became very clear that Roosevelt himself,
*  as well as his top officials, were growing very anxious about the idea of Nazi Germany
*  maybe beating us to creating the atomic bomb.
*  I came across this memo from FDR to Vannevar Bush, who at that time was overseeing the
*  administration of the Manhattan Project.
*  And it was just one line and he wrote, do you have the money, FDR?
*  So the administration essentially realizes Germany's close to getting the bomb, so time
*  for some major money.
*  Do you have it?
*  You know, that means Congress.
*  Exactly.
*  Only Congress has the power of the purse.
*  And so they decided we have to ask Congress for a big infusion of cash now.
*  So that also means we have to tell members of Congress that we're doing this, right?
*  We have to let them in on the secret.
*  Right.
*  And so Roosevelt gives the word to, really his point man on this was Henry L. Stimson,
*  who was then the Secretary of War.
*  And he says, I need you to tell a very small group of lawmakers exactly what's happening
*  here.
*  I need you to get them to agree to pass this money.
*  And crucially, I need you to get them to keep it a secret.
*  And so Stimson heads up to Capitol Hill.
*  He has two separate secret meetings, one in the House, one in the Senate.
*  In one particular meeting in the House, he actually brings George Marshall, the incredibly
*  famous general, to the meeting to kind of impress upon lawmakers just the seriousness
*  of what he is asking them to do.
*  And we know from Senator Elmer Thomas's memoir what their pitch was.
*  He writes that he received a call from the Senate Majority Leader saying, I'm inviting
*  you to this secret meeting.
*  You need to come to my office in an hour.
*  You cannot tell anyone where you are going or that you are going to a meeting at all.
*  Keep it under wraps.
*  Wow.
*  Okay.
*  So Elmer Thomas goes an hour later to the Senate Majority Leader's office.
*  It's just him, a couple other senators, and the War Secretary and a couple of his officers.
*  And in the meeting, Henry Stimson, the War Secretary, tells these senators that the United
*  States has been working on creating a bomb that can, quote, do as much damage as 10,000
*  tons of any explosive known at that time.
*  And he writes that he recalls Stimson saying that the Germans are working on a weapon just
*  And that whoever is able to create this weapon first is going to win the war.
*  Wow.
*  And so what does Elmer Thomas think about this?
*  What does he say?
*  Well, he writes in his memoir, this was something that absolutely floored him.
*  And so the impression that Thomas and the other senators get is that this is absolutely
*  something that must be done, that must be kept a secret, and that they are going to
*  go to any lengths that they can to pass this money.
*  OK, so this tiny group of lawmakers in Congress agreed to secretly fund this project.
*  But I guess the question remains, how do you do that?
*  How do you hide it?
*  Well, this is maybe my favorite part of the entire story.
*  And it's something that Elmer Thomas's memoir, again, I love I love Elmer Thomas now in this
*  memoir, that he let us in on the secret, which is that they hid it essentially in an
*  innocuous sounding line item.
*  I wasn't able to find a copy of the bill, but I did find a report from the hearing where
*  they considered the bill.
*  And when you look through all of the different line items for the spending bill, I mean,
*  they had the horses that they were going to use over in Italy, horses and donkeys.
*  And then there was this one line item that said expediting production.
*  And that was the shell that they used to conceal this 800 million dollars for the bomb expediting
*  production.
*  So that's a pretty bland language.
*  I mean, it's not a good disguise, right?
*  You can completely see why it would not have raised any eyebrows at the time.
*  There was a short description in that hearing report that said, well, you know, this is
*  a line item intended to speed munitions to our boys in Europe to make sure that we're
*  using the most modern weapons on the battlefield possible, which is a huge understatement when
*  you know what was actually hidden there.
*  Right.
*  So, Katie, did anybody notice it?
*  Well, you know, there were a few close calls.
*  And one of them that was probably the most amusing to me actually came through in the
*  of an anecdote told by former speaker Sam Rayburn, who told this story to a historian
*  at his home in Texas many years after the fact.
*  He said that he was walking around one day shortly after that secret meeting with the
*  war secretary where the lawmakers all agreed to hide this money and that he saw one of
*  the congressmen who had been in that meeting talking to a reporter.
*  And he said the congressman, when I saw him, looked funny.
*  At least in Rayburn's interpretation, the congressman had been leaking the contents
*  of this secret meeting to the newspaper man.
*  And what does he do?
*  Well, so Rayburn goes up to the newspaper man and he said, and this is what Rayburn
*  recalled, he went up to the newspaper man and said, you are a good American, aren't
*  you?
*  You love your country.
*  The newspaper man said, of course.
*  Rayburn said, then don't print anything about what he just told you.
*  Wow.
*  So the newspaper man caves, right?
*  How do you understand what happened here?
*  Well, I think you also have to understand the context of this time period, right?
*  The United States was in this protracted war with Germany and with Japan.
*  It was a time period where I think everyone, including the press, were being expected to
*  sort of rally around the flag to support our troops.
*  And so I think he was just let into a secret of the highest national security in a hallway
*  by one member of Congress, only to be then abruptly headed off by the very powerful speaker
*  of the house who appeals to his sense of patriotism.
*  But I mean, this would have been an enormously difficult decision.
*  I mean, if I were that reporter now, this would be something that I would escalate up
*  to our highest editors and probably would be the subject of a really fierce debate at
*  our newspaper.
*  So it sounds like it was no small feat to keep this thing under wraps until, of course,
*  it wasn't a secret.
*  And the whole world learned of the U.S. atomic program in, you know, shocking detail when
*  the United States dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.
*  What was it like, Katie, to be doing this congressional historical sleuthing, you know,
*  uncovering all of this maneuvering in the 1940s, while at the same time covering Congress
*  over the past year?
*  Any conclusions you draw from the comparison?
*  Well, you know, since the story has come out, the question that I've gotten from a lot of
*  readers is, and I think this is what you're driving at, could something like this happen
*  today?
*  Could a few members of Congress today hide some sort of big program or top secret activity
*  within the spending bills?
*  And I found a number of interviews from some of the participants in the Manhattan Project
*  that were done years after we bombed Hiroshima.
*  And the answer they gave was that they didn't think it would be possible to hide a program
*  or a project of that magnitude outside the context of a huge war at a time when there
*  was this sense of patriotism among so many people.
*  But look, I currently cover federal spending, and I do read through the spending bills that
*  are passed into law.
*  And these are bills that are typically hundreds, if not thousands of pages long.
*  They are written in extremely archaic, dense legislative language.
*  And I look through trying to see if there's any programs that seem peculiar or strange
*  or warrant sort of greater investigation as to what they're doing in that spending
*  bill.
*  But the phrase expediting production, I mean, it's so innocuous.
*  If I were a reporter back in 1944 coming through that bill, I don't think it would have caused
*  me to raise any eyebrows.
*  I think I would have read it and thought, yeah, that makes sense.
*  Of course, we're trying to send weapons more quickly over to Europe.
*  And so I do think kind of the moral of that story, if there is one, is that just a few
*  lawmakers can hide something like this if there's the will to do so.
*  Katie, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what you should know today.
*  On Monday, the Supreme Court sided with the Biden administration, allowing federal authorities
*  to cut or remove parts of a concertina wire barrier along the Mexican border that Texas
*  erected to keep migrants from crossing into the state.
*  The ruling by a five to four vote was a temporary measure that lifted a lower court's ban on
*  removing the wire while it considered the case.
*  The justices gave no reason for their decision, which is typical when they act on such emergency
*  applications.
*  The ruling was a victory for the Biden administration in the increasingly bitter dispute between
*  the White House and Governor Greg Abbott of Texas, an outspoken critic of President Biden's
*  border policy.
