*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, when the democratic presidential nomination process begins tomorrow in South Carolina,
*  the question is not who will win, but whether President Biden can fix his growing problem
*  with black voters.
*  My colleague, Maya Kim, explains it's Friday, February 2.
*  So Maya, after weeks of covering the Republican presidential nomination process in Iowa
*  and New Hampshire, we are now officially ready to turn to the democratic nomination process.
*  And that begins in South Carolina, not where it used to begin, which was in Iowa, along
*  with the Republicans starting there.
*  And just to begin, remind us why South Carolina is going first this year.
*  So this process really started four years ago when black voters in South Carolina turned
*  out in large numbers to vote for then candidate Biden, effectively saving his campaign.
*  He was really trailing in Iowa and in New Hampshire.
*  Right.
*  And it was when he got to South Carolina that all of these black voters, seeing him as really
*  the most pragmatic option, turned out in these large numbers to vote for him.
*  And he took that momentum from South Carolina to Super Tuesday, where he won pretty overwhelmingly.
*  And then of course, was then the Democratic Party's nominee for President.
*  Right.
*  And Biden's very explicit about this and proud of it.
*  He will frequently say black voters in South Carolina saved, revived my primary campaign
*  and they are the reason on President.
*  He is not quiet about the role that South Carolina has played in his life and certainly
*  in his political livelihood.
*  President Biden really points to South Carolina and black voters here as a really key part
*  of his coalition.
*  And it's the reason why he openly says he asked the Democratic Party to put South Carolina
*  first in the order of early primary states, putting black voters, black Americans in the
*  driver's seat.
*  Taking the first Democrats in the country to decide who they want to be President.
*  And there's not a lot of suspense around what's going to happen tomorrow.
*  The primary here in South Carolina is largely uncompetitive.
*  It's very clear that Biden will be victorious.
*  However, we're not really watching for the election results.
*  We're more looking at what's happening outside of them and some of the dynamics that have
*  caused Democrats to really hone in on South Carolina.
*  And it's because they've identified in polling and focus groups and conversations a real
*  problem with one of the key coalitions that they will need in November and that's black voters.
*  And that's why South Carolina for the last several weeks has been something of a laboratory
*  or a proving ground of sorts for Democrats as they try to form a message that would
*  excite and galvanize black voters not just here but across the country.
*  Democrats hope here is that what they learn from black voters in South Carolina is applicable
*  to black voters in other parts of the country, cities like Detroit, Milwaukee, even Atlanta,
*  with large black communities in key swing states.
*  Well, my remind us of just how meaningful a problem Biden has with black voters according
*  to all the data that you have been looking at.
*  It's a pretty big problem.
*  In 2020, President Biden won the election with about 87% of the black vote.
*  But polling that the times has done found that at this stage, he only has about 71% of support
*  from black voters.
*  That's a pretty steep decline.
*  Sure is.
*  And what's even more concerning for Democrats is that former President Trump has actually
*  increased his support among black voters from 8% that he won in 2020 to about 22% that
*  our poll found late last year.
*  It's a really striking drift away from Biden because the Republican presidential candidate
*  has not topped more than 12% from black voters in almost 50 years.
*  And so if former President Trump were to really have more than 20% support from black voters,
*  that would be a historic shift in black voting behavior.
*  I'm curious, Maya.
*  When you're reporting, what are you finding explains such a major decline in support from
*  what you have described as a core and historically faithful group of Biden supporters, these black
*  voters?
*  And what reasons are being offered to explain it?
*  I've spoken to black voters across the country.
*  Hi, this is Maya King.
*  I'm a reporter with the New York.
*  Hi, is this story?
*  Yeah.
*  Hi, Teleta.
*  Hello.
*  Hi, Ava Young.
*  It's Maya King with the New York Times.
*  Is now a good time to share.
*  One theme that's really emerged in these conversations, Michael, has been this general feeling of
*  malaise.
*  I'm just not one.
*  Like, they haven't won me over yet.
*  Everybody talked and gets everybody to vote for them.
*  And then when they get in the office, they don't do a lot of the things that they said
*  or going to do.
*  People want to...
*  And also, this idea that President Biden campaigned and made so many promises to black voters,
*  but did not deliver on those promises.
*  Like what?
*  Student loan debt is one issue that comes up quite a bit.
*  Because I'm working at the fact that now I've got to build it, I've got to pay it, I've
*  really been making me to pay it.
*  So it's like, what did you really do?
*  A lot of black folks that I talk to are up to their necks in student loan debt.
*  And they remember the promise that Democrats made to try to alleviate some of that.
*  Like you guys talked so much about getting it done and then the forgiveness is not but
*  for so long, you know what I mean?
*  Like, still let you not have to pay for a little bit of it, but then you have to end up
*  paying it anyway.
*  So I mean...
*  And they also remember how that hasn't really worked out.
*  And it feels like a promise that really fell through, one that they were really looking
*  forward to, that Democrats did not make good on.
*  Right.
*  Biden attempted to make good on it through executive action.
*  He has been undermined largely by Republicans seeking to block him in the courts and he
*  hasn't had a lot of success with the courts.
*  Right.
*  And how old are you?
*  I'm 18.
*  Okay, so you are old.
*  And especially when I talk to younger voters, what they point out to me is his age.
*  Well, I know a lot of people talk about how old he is and how he's like, he's too old
*  to get around or soon.
*  They'll say that he'll pass away.
*  They see him as his representative of a bygone era of politics.
*  He doesn't understand or really relate to a lot of the issues that are more relevant
*  to their lives and that they just don't see him as a figure who was really compelling
*  to them, who they would want to vote for and feel enthusiastic about.
*  Right.
*  What do you want to see Biden do and like what should he tell people your age should get
*  people to listen and turn back out to vote?
*  I feel like a effective message would just be like knowing that he's listening.
*  Maybe he doesn't know.
*  Right.
*  This is kind of the age and charisma question that has trailed Biden now for years.
*  Absolutely.
*  Another thing that I hear a lot is of course the economy that things are more expensive
*  that even though people are working, it's still hard for them to afford housing, to
*  afford groceries and to afford being able to support their families.
*  Same time we're looking at the economy and with best for the people, gas prices were
*  lower.
*  More jobs were available for people.
*  They point to this steep uptick in prices and this general harder living as really having
*  been palpable under Biden's presidency.
*  This country is a business and a man with business ethics such as Trump led to come to
*  great.
*  And this is where Trump's appeal starts to really show itself.
*  I look at it as a business aspect and a better choice for this country by the way that
*  it is would be Donald Trump.
*  I spoke to a voter who said that he felt the economy was better under former president
*  Trump that he looked at the former president's position as a businessman in his words and
*  said that he has a better grasp of what's happening in the economy.
*  Interesting.
*  I'm just waiting to see who's going to have the best views, who's going to put out the
*  best policies for the American people and whatever side that is, you know, that's what
*  side I will leave you.
*  But today you're saying that's Trump.
*  Right.
*  And what else are you hearing from these black voters?
*  Well, something that's come up a little more recently in conversations with particularly
*  black organizers and community leaders and faith leaders is a real disaffection for Biden
*  in terms of their perception of his support for the war between Israel and Hamas.
*  Black faith leaders are extremely disappointed in the Biden administration on this issue.
*  I spoke with a number of black pastors across the country.
*  There are many who are what I have conversations with them having real issues with the White
*  House who said that the folks in their pews, their congregants are really upset and disappointed
*  in the Biden administration.
*  Babies and incubators and mothers and fathers, children, people had nothing to do with Hamas
*  being killed.
*  As they see on the news, on social media and in their feeds, these images of destruction
*  in Gaza.
*  And the fact that 25,000 have been killed without the kind of outcry in America, we know
*  wouldn't happen if these were white people.
*  We know that.
*  And so there is that common knowledge that black Americans feel.
*  And they have started to understand or feel some sort of kinship between Palestinians
*  and their plight and that of black Americans, that both of these groups in some way are
*  both oppressed people or have a history of oppression in their respective countries.
*  We're giving Israel a lot of taxpayer money to my knowledge with no conditions.
*  And that y'all is telling us, just give us the money and leave us alone.
*  That's untenable.
*  That's untenable.
*  They feel like the Biden administration has played such a role in helping finance this
*  and it's really impacted their support.
*  Now among a very key group of black voters, black faith voters for the Biden administration.
*  When you say black faith voters, just explain that.
*  These are largely older black folks, church-going folks who spend a lot of time in black faith
*  spaces.
*  And this is really a group of people that lies at the core of Biden's black support.
*  These are the folks who vote very regularly in almost every election.
*  And also, I should point out that black churches are a really important part of Democrats
*  get out the vote efforts.
*  That's been a place where they've always been able to talk directly to black voters.
*  So it's very striking now to hear that the same folks who are pretty used to hearing
*  from Democrats, talking about politics, may have even had Biden come visit their church
*  are saying that they are paying attention to his foreign policy and saying that they
*  really, really don't agree with it.
*  So assuming the Biden campaign has found similar reasons as you have for the growing black
*  dissolutionment with him in this reelection campaign, it feels like the challenge for
*  them is just the breath of explanations voters are giving for why they're souring on
*  him.
*  It's not just one thing.
*  It's a dozen things.
*  It's economic explanations.
*  A personal disconnection.
*  It's things like his support for Israel and the war against Gaza.
*  And that would seem to all add up to a very challenging problem to fix.
*  Yes.
*  And it's a problem that can't be fixed with a single message.
*  It's really one that they're going to have to tackle across multiple fronts.
*  And so I think that's why you see so much money and time and effort being poured into
*  a state like South Carolina.
*  This is the campaign's first chance to really tackle this issue and figure out what exactly
*  they'll need to do to fix this problem that they have with black voter enthusiasm and
*  replicate that in places across the country.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Maya as the Biden campaign tries to solve its black voter problem in South Carolina,
*  what has its efforts there actually looked like on the ground?
*  How is it trying to shore up and win back some of these black voters?
*  Well, Democrats have spared no expense in their efforts here in South Carolina.
*  We've seen about a six-figure investment in staffing and that's senior advisers to the
*  campaign and also an army of field staffers who have been in the more rural and heavily
*  black areas of the state.
*  Hello, hello, South Carolina.
*  It's good to be home with so many friends.
*  President Biden himself has been to South Carolina twice in the last month.
*  Good afternoon.
*  Good afternoon, South Carolina.
*  Vice President Harris has been here three times and we've also seen several pretty high-profile
*  Democrats come and visit the state and encourage folks to turn out.
*  People like House Majority Leader Hockeying Jeffries, California Governor Gavin Newsom,
*  and all of them are going to these really far-flung parts of the state, meeting with voters,
*  talking with them.
*  And it is you who convinced your neighbors and family members and friends and co-workers.
*  Reminds them of the role that they played in the 2020 election.
*  In so doing, South Carolina set the path for Joe Biden to become president of the United
*  States and me to be the first black woman vice president of the United States.
*  It is you who did that.
*  And what is the overarching message that Biden, Harris, and all these representatives from
*  the campaign are really experimenting with as they speak to these groups of black voters?
*  I heard a slogan multiple times when I was at Democrats first in the nation dinner
*  last Saturday.
*  It was this message of promises made, promises kept.
*  And they're driving home this message, Democrats, that they actually have made good on many
*  of the campaign promises that they made in 2020.
*  It's just that they've done a pretty poor job of articulating them in the past.
*  So the campaign is speaking pretty directly to what you have found, Maya, in your reporting
*  that there's a perceived gap between what Biden said he would do for black America and
*  what he has actually been able to do.
*  I'm really curious, what are the examples that the campaign points to where they can say
*  here's a promise we made that we actually kept?
*  Well, where you see an argument from a black voter in polling or even in our own reporting
*  about falling short of the Biden administration, you can expect to see here in South Carolina
*  Biden himself countering that message and saying, this is where we've actually helped you.
*  And this is where this administration has delivered on the promises it's made.
*  I promise to help ease accumulated student debt for millions of folks carrying during the
*  crisis of the pandemic.
*  Supreme Court blocked me, but didn't stop me.
*  On the point of student loan forgiveness, this idea that Biden dropped the ball on relieving
*  student loans.
*  Another 25,000 people a month, beginning next month, are going to start to get their student
*  loans forgiven because they're getting notified with a letter for me.
*  You're about to get that relief.
*  They've come out on these large stages and actually talked about instances where people
*  have had their student loans relieved through different policies that the Biden campaign
*  has passed.
*  Record unemployment, including the lowest levels of black unemployment ever recorded American
*  history.
*  They've also paraded out the fact that black unemployment is the lowest it's ever been.
*  I promise you, we've made record investments, HBCUs, including South Carolina's 8HBCU.
*  HBCUs, student or justice talent as any student in America.
*  But their college and universities don't have the funding and endowments for their cutting
*  edge laboratories and research centers.
*  They've gone to a number of historically black colleges and universities here in South
*  Carolina and actually laid out how much money each university has received from the Biden
*  administration.
*  Well, I've invested so far $7 billion in HBCUs in the county.
*  Help support our brilliant HBCUs students.
*  And again, a promise made and a promise kept.
*  Making the point that this president has invested more in historically black colleges than
*  actually any other president in history.
*  Interesting.
*  Other policies that I've heard quite a bit, a little bit more in the weeds, but I think
*  it does matter to these rural voters.
*  40,000 projects in across American county rebuilding our roads and our bridges, affordable
*  high-speed internet everywhere in America.
*  Ripping out every poisonous lead pipe in America.
*  So every child can turn on the faucet, drink clean water out, worried about brain damage.
*  Things like rural broadband and internet access and far-flung parts of the state, infrastructure,
*  clean water and pipes in some of these places that historically have not had access to those
*  things.
*  And all the progress we've made comes down to a simple proposition.
*  Promises made and promises kept.
*  Right.
*  It's an interesting approach.
*  I mean, on their own, some of these things that the campaign is talking about seem relatively
*  small.
*  But the idea is to have those accumulate into a message that your life is better under
*  President Biden.
*  So stick with them.
*  But what that seems to leave out are the less tangible objections that black voters
*  might have to President Biden that you found in your reporting his age and the war in
*  Gaza.
*  And the issues that are more complicated and harder for the campaign to counteract than
*  something like internet access or clean water.
*  Right.
*  And these are things that the campaign is going to have to work on over the next 10 months.
*  But I think what they're really driving home here in South Carolina is a counter to this
*  message that they have not tangibly changed the lives of people and actually affected
*  change in these different communities.
*  And I think that their hope is that once more people understand the way that these policies
*  have positively impacted their lives, it could counter some of the ill feeling that voters
*  might have towards Biden.
*  So how is the campaign attempting to measure the success of what they're up to in South
*  Carolina?
*  Like you said, they know they're going to win.
*  So when the data rolls in at the end of Saturday and they look at it, how are they going
*  to know what is effective in galvanizing black voters and just as importantly, how are
*  they going to understand what's not effective in galvanizing black voters?
*  You know, Democrats have been pretty tight lipped here in South Carolina in terms of identifying
*  what success would look like for them.
*  And in conversations with people who will really be watching turnout numbers tomorrow,
*  I think if we see large turnout, especially in these heavily black areas of the state,
*  Biden's allies here in South Carolina can count that as a win.
*  Mm hmm.
*  So that's the measure turnout.
*  How many people actually show up at the polls, which is a little bit complicated because
*  as we've said, this is not a competitive primary.
*  It's not a weekend.
*  And the way you get people out to the polls is usually by giving them a competition in
*  which they have very strong feelings.
*  That's right.
*  And that really is Democrats' challenge here, even as they've laid out this message and
*  aim to get more voters excited about supporting President Biden's reelection, it's really
*  difficult to actually get people to vote for that in a largely uncontested race.
*  And of course, former President Trump, who is likely to be the Republican nominee, will
*  not be on this ballot in the primary.
*  But if we do find pretty large turnout after Saturday, I think it points to the success
*  of this entire operation.
*  Mm hmm.
*  But even though this is not a competitive primary, Democrats still turned out to show their
*  support for this president's reelection.
*  It strikes me that if this strategy doesn't end up working, if it doesn't work in South
*  Carolina, and if it doesn't end up working in any of the states where Democrats need
*  to turn out Black voters, that this might not just be a problem for President Biden.
*  And of course, it would be a problem for Biden.
*  It might cost them the election.
*  But if as Democrats fear, Black voters are open to Trump and are willing to vote for
*  a Republican in ways they haven't in decades, then this becomes a much larger problem,
*  perhaps even crisis, for the entire Democratic Party and its brand.
*  That's right.
*  It would mean a fundamental reordering of the Democratic coalition.
*  And that would create much longer term issues for any Democrat running for President or
*  even down ballot.
*  Right.
*  And so for all those reasons, what happens in South Carolina matters because it's the
*  start of something very important that keeps Black voters with the Democratic Party or it's
*  the beginning of a real rupture potentially in that relationship.
*  It's a significant moment.
*  And so in the same way that Black voters turning out in mass for President Biden in 2020
*  is what drove his momentum to ultimately win the election.
*  Now four years later, the possibility of Black voters shifting away from Democrats after
*  South Carolina could be the thing that threatens his reelection here in 2024.
*  Oh my out.
*  Thank you very much, we appreciate it.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Thursday, the European Union authorized the creation of a $54 billion fund to support
*  Ukraine in its war against Russia.
*  A crucial lifeline because Congress has refused to adopt new American funding for the country.
*  The EU fund had previously been blocked by the leader of Hungary, Viktor Orban, an ally
*  of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
*  And in the latest round of negotiations, Orban dropped his opposition.
*  And President Biden has ordered broad financial and travel sanctions against at least four
*  Israeli settlers accused of violent attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank.
*  His toughest actions against Israel to date since it declared war on Hamas.
*  The Times reports that the sanctions are aimed in part at a swaging Arab American voters
*  in the US who have expressed fury over Biden's forceful support of Israel in the war.
