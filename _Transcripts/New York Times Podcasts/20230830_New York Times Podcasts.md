*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Barrow. This is a Daily.
*  In the Republican President's Juries, the battle for second place has been jolted by
*  the sudden rise of a political newcomer whose popularity has already eclipsed that of
*  far more seasoned candidates. Today, my colleague Jonathan Weissmann on the backstory, message,
*  and strategy of Vivek Ramaswamy. It's Wednesday, August 30th.
*  Jonathan, for the past week, the story of the Republican presidential race has been
*  quite unexpectedly the story of Vivek Ramaswamy.
*  Remarkable, huh? Six months ago, Vivek Ramaswamy was, as he says, a skinny little guy with
*  a long name. Nobody knew who he was, but he was out there telling the soil in Iowa and
*  New Hampshire using his own money, which is copious, and his patented style of saying
*  no to nobody. This is a guy who will be on any TV show, any podcast, any radio show.
*  You ask him, he'll be there. He could do as many as 30 media hits a day. And that is
*  really his secret.
*  Right. I remember thinking around the end of the sprint that this guy was everywhere.
*  He was the kind of Vivek ubiquity.
*  And he was rising in the polls. He was actually moving upward while Ron DeSantis, who was
*  supposed to be the great threat to Donald Trump, is going down in the polls. And suddenly,
*  you're starting to see some guy named Vivek Ramaswamy, who is about to overtake the
*  second place Republican in the primaries. It was kind of a jolt. Right.
*  And as if to confirm what we were seeing, these memos leaked out from the super PAC that
*  is trying to boost DeSantis's campaign just ahead of what would be the first debate
*  of the 2024 Republican primary season. And in those memos, that super PAC says, watch
*  out for Vivek Ramaswamy and hit him hard multiple times when you get onto that stage.
*  Right. Nothing could better confirm that Ramaswamy was having a moment than the campaign
*  apparatus around the guy who was supposed to be having a moment saying, you should be
*  worried about this other person and you should be beating him up.
*  Yeah. I mean, Ramaswamy had been saying for months, oh, this is really a two person
*  race. It's between Donald Trump and me. And it always kind of sounded like a joke, right?
*  Right. But then all of a sudden, these documents that merged that look like they worry about
*  the rise of this guy, Vivek Ramaswamy. And then we get to the debate and we're all expecting
*  that Vivek Ramaswamy will take a hit from Ron DeSantis. We're all watching for it. And in fact,
*  Vivek Ramaswamy takes multiple hits from multiple candidates. And every time he proved
*  deft, he somehow bobbed and weaved and turned the debate back on his opponents. And he got
*  exactly what he wanted from that debate because he was the guy they were taking seriously.
*  And he was confirming to the rest of the world what he had been saying to himself for months,
*  I'm the guy to beat. Right. And suddenly after that debate, it felt like we were looking
*  at a bonafide breakout moment in this primary for the vague Ramaswamy of what duration and
*  importance. We can't say at the moment, but a breakout moment nonetheless. And of course,
*  why we wanted to talk to you, Jonathan, because you have been covering Ramaswamy closely for many
*  months traveling with him across the country. You've gotten to really know him. And so we want to talk
*  to you about the full Ramaswamy story, not just the momentum of the past few weeks, but a complete
*  portrait of who he is and how he reached this point. So Vivek Ramaswamy is the child of Indian
*  immigrants who were Brahmins, the highest caste in Indian society. His father was an engineer.
*  He was trained at the MIT of India. His mother is a psychiatrist. They settled in a server of
*  Cincinnati. His dad, he likes to say was a liberal. And he liked to talk back to his dad and
*  take the contrarian conservative position. And by the time he got to Harvard, he was a libertarian.
*  He actually had a alter ego called Davek, who was a libertarian rapper.
*  But his undergraduate degree is in biology. And he got a job out of undergraduate as a stock
*  picker for a prominent hedge fund. He was a biotech guy and told the hedge fund what biotech
*  companies looked promising. And ultimately, that's how he became very, very rich.
*  When he gets out of Yale Law School, he starts a company, Roy Vand, with a really smart idea
*  of combing through the patent files of the big pharmaceutical companies looking for discarded
*  patents that weren't abandoned because they wouldn't necessarily work, but were abandoned because
*  they didn't look particularly profitable for a company as big as a merc. And he thought,
*  well, I'm going to buy the patent cheap and I'm going to develop them cheap.
*  You were saying he's basically selling bargain basement patents that everybody else is more
*  less abandoned. Exactly. And he had a lot of success. He was involved in bringing about five
*  different drugs to market, which in the biotech world is a pretty good track record.
*  But the drug that really put them on the map was in fact a failure. Mr. Ramasswami, welcome to
*  the Bay of Money. Good to see you. A drug to address Alzheimer's. Tell me why Glaxo
*  kind of wrote this drug off and yet you have such great hopes for it. I actually think the
*  potential opportunity here is really tremendous for delivering value to patients.
*  Ramasswami just went everywhere in the biotech world and pitched this idea that he was going to
*  bring an Alzheimer's drug to market. Actually, we believe we're only one additional
*  phase three study away from the approval of this drug on global basis. He pumped up the stock price
*  of his company and its subsidiary ex-event way high. When I see a red eye stock, I don't want to
*  get people hurt. You know that. Absolutely. You got one drug and you know, everyone hopes it
*  works. I think you're asking all the right questions exactly. Fair enough. Okay, well, we're going
*  to be in the following situation and then lo and behold, it didn't work. It failed. The
*  subsidiary collapsed. A lot of people took a bath, but the way the structure was set up for his
*  company, Ramasswami did fine. In fact, by the time he's 35, he's made $200 million. Wow. So
*  that sounds a bit like the story of a charismatic salesman telling people what they want to hear,
*  which doesn't seem like that biggest stretch or leap from politics. No, exactly. In fact,
*  he was in some ways born to politics. This is a guy who knows how to sell himself.
*  And why does he eventually turn his attention to politics? It goes back to 2020 and the Black Lives
*  Matter protests that erupted after George Floyd's murder. Remember at that time, CEOs from
*  companies large and small were speaking out in favor of the Black Lives Matter protesters and
*  against systemic racism against police violence. And Ramasswami wasn't insulated from those trends. In
*  fact, he was under pressure from employees of his company, Roy Van, to be out there, to speak out.
*  And he said, no, it is not the role of a chief executive officer of a company with
*  fiduciary responsibilities to its shareholders to get involved in politics at all. Now joining me,
*  the vague Ramasswami, big corporate entities, embracing woke politics,
*  woke off. Why? Big business in this country decided to enter an arranged marriage with the new
*  woke left. And it's more like mutual prostitution because each side gets something out of the trade.
*  He started appearing on Fox News. But these woke values are really easy. They love anti-racism
*  because they could applaud diversity and inclusion, put some token minorities on their boards.
*  He alienated a lot of very big name Democrats who were advisors to his company. And he also alienated
*  some of the employees of his company so much so that within months of his first commentary in public,
*  he had stepped back, left as CEO, and was writing a book called Woke Inc. A Jeremiah against liberal
*  politics in corporate board suites. He follows up his first book, Woke Inc. with two other books,
*  and translates that to a lot of appearances on Fox News, on Fox Business. He starts making a name
*  for himself in conservative circles. And he decides I want to run for president. And he seems to be
*  driven by his fear of wokeism from the left that societies under assault from liberal activism.
*  And when he finally announces his run for president, he does so with a vision for this country and
*  its society that is extremely dark. We'll do it back.
*  So Jonathan, tell us more about this dark message at the heart of Ramaswami's eventual
*  presidential campaign. Well, nothing captures that message more than the video that launched him.
*  We're in the middle of a national identity crisis. Faith, patriotism, and hard work have disappeared.
*  He speaks of a hole in our soul, a darkness in the American society. We hunger to be part of
*  something bigger than ourselves, yet we cannot even answer the question of what it means to be an
*  American. Today, the woke left praise on that vacuum. They tell you that your race, your gender,
*  and your sexual orientation govern who you are, what you can achieve, and what you're allowed to think.
*  This is psychological slavery. And his message is that he can bring the country back from this
*  morass. And that is why today I am announcing my run for president of the United States.
*  This isn't just a political campaign. This is a cultural movement to create a new American dream
*  for the next generation. Jonathan, some of this candidly feels a bit familiar for the Republican
*  Party in the era of Donald Trump, who has long railed for instance against political correctness
*  and will culture. So what in your mind, and I guess in Ramasswami's mind, makes this distinct.
*  You know, it's not just his diagnosis of what Donald Trump called American Carnage.
*  It's his remedy. It's the details to actually do something about it that holds his agenda
*  much farther to the right of Donald Trump. Explain that.
*  Well, for instance, remember Donald Trump kind of invented the notion of the deep state.
*  Well, Ramasswami talks about the administrative state and he says that he would do things that Trump
*  never dreamed of. The people who we elect to run the government ought to be the ones who actually
*  run the government. He's talking about cutting 75% of the federal workforce,
*  eliminating the Department of Education, the IRS, the FBI. He's talking about
*  gutting the administrative state, not just railing against it. We will shut them down.
*  And that's just the very beginning of his agenda. So in the first day of my campaign,
*  I pledge to do something which is to use US military force, if necessary, to address the Mexican
*  drug cartels who yes are terrorist organizations. This is a guy who talks about
*  taking US troops and actually attacking Mexican cartels in Mexico. Wow, I don't think citizenship
*  should be something that anybody automatically takes for granted, born here or not.
*  He talks about ending birthright citizenship, which would mean that the children of undocumented
*  immigrants born on US soil would no longer be American citizens. Why are you against supporting
*  Ukraine? Because it does not advance American interests and as the US president, I'm not running
*  for any other role I'm then looking after the interests of Americans. And then, if anything, his
*  foreign policy even even farther to the right, certainly a swing toward isolationism.
*  He talks about not giving another dime of military aid to Ukraine, but he even goes farther.
*  I would freeze the current lines of control and that would leave parts of the Donbass region with Russia.
*  He says he would give Vladimir Putin Eastern Ukraine. Our engagement in Ukraine is further driving Russia
*  into China's arms. So my foreign policy centers on weakening that alliance. He says we need to make
*  friends with Vladimir Putin. He doesn't trust Putin, but he wants to woo Putin away from China.
*  And to do that, he's willing to give up the sovereignty of a would-be ally, Ukraine.
*  And if we rediscover who we really are, then we can actually stand up to the actual threats we
*  face on the global stage. And the top of the list, it isn't in Ukraine. It is communist China.
*  And he talks about that the most important piece of his foreign policy is to confront China
*  and to break the United States's dependence on China. That is our number one threat that we face
*  in the next century. Simo, he seems ready to give up on Taiwan. We are dependent on a tiny island
*  nation off the southeast coast of China for our entire modern way of life in the United States of America.
*  He's actually said, out loud, many times, that he would spend the first four years of his presidency
*  building up the domestic semiconductor industry. So we would no longer be dependent on Taiwan for
*  semiconductors. And then at the end of those four years, he would no longer defend Taiwan.
*  Basically, signaling to Beijing, take it is yours. And we will not take the risk of war that
*  risks American lives after that for some nationalistic dispute between China and Taiwan. Wow.
*  And then that leads to actually perhaps maybe his most controversial position at least in
*  Republican politics. He'd like to further the bilateral peace agreements that Israel is pursuing
*  with its neighbors. So he can stop giving military aid to Israel. Now, aid to Israel is
*  sacrosanct in the Republican Party. But he's saying, you know, eventually we don't need to do that either.
*  Jonathan, you started to hint at this, but these are extremely unorthodox views of American foreign
*  policy period. And especially for a Republican when it comes to Taiwan and Israel defending those
*  two have been pillars of modern Republican foreign policy. So what do you make of that?
*  Well, it's not only radical, but if you just look under the surface, some of this doesn't make a
*  lot of sense. I mean, he says that we're going to confront China in every way, but that somehow we
*  will have four years to build up a semiconductor industry so China can have Taiwan. That doesn't make
*  a lot of sense for a confrontation. But also how does he know that in four years we'll be able to
*  build up a semiconductor industry that's totally independent of Taiwan? How does he know that China
*  won't invade before four years? It's like the world doesn't work the way he wants it to, but he's
*  almost willing it to work the way he wants it to. Right. He's saying the arguments don't add up
*  their flawed and they are not representative of someone who's really understood geopolitics.
*  I mean, this has led foreign policy experts, including conservative foreign policy experts,
*  to say that Vivek Ramaswami is just engaged in bizarre magical thinking. Remember on the debate
*  stage, Nikki Haley looked at him and said, you don't know what you're talking about. You've never
*  conducted foreign policy and it shows. If ideas like this don't make sense. Why is Ramaswami even
*  articulating them? I mean, it's not clear to me that Republican voters need him to make a four-part
*  argument around Taiwan that results in it being given back to China. So why is he even treading
*  there? What you need to know about Vivek Ramaswami is that he has this quality about him
*  that anticipates what people want to hear and gives them what they want, whether it's the truth or not.
*  I remember being in New Hampshire and a woman stood up and said that she really didn't like all
*  this anti-wokism that seemed beside the point to her and he said, oh, I'm not really into that
*  stuff anymore. But in the back of the room, they were giving out little buttons that said, stop
*  wokeism vote Vivek. Wait, how could you not be into wokeism? That's his whole campaign. That's his
*  whole campaign. And yet he said he's not into it anymore. He says these things a lot. I remember
*  I remember following him to the South Side of Chicago. He was there to talk about his immigration
*  policies because they were settling migrants shipped up from Texas in the South Side and
*  the community was getting upset. He thought he was going to be able to stir the pot with
*  black Chicagoans about this, but they were much more interested in really peppering him
*  on his opposition to affirmative action, on his belief that there's no such thing as systemic
*  racism, and then nobody asked about immigration. Just nobody. And I was in Iowa just a few days
*  ago and he had this stick where he said, nowhere were they more interested in my immigration policies
*  and my promise to go after the cartels than in the South Side of Chicago in an all black audience.
*  I remember writing in my notes, this is a lie. Wow. So it's clear that his message has a radical
*  quality to it. The content of what he's saying can at times strain logic and practicality.
*  You're spending all this time with him out in the field. How are voters that you're talking
*  to and watching receiving all of this messaging and content? The thing about Vivek Ramaswamy is
*  he exudes confidence so much that whatever he says sounds correct. He speaks with such clarity
*  that he doesn't invite you to analyze whether what he said was logical or not. And I remember
*  everywhere I go, I talk to people after his events and they always say he is so brilliant. They
*  are convinced that whatever he said had to be right because he said it so well.
*  I mean, it sounds like his success as a salesman in biotech is very naturally translating into selling
*  the idea of himself as president on the campaign trail. It is remarkable because obviously Donald
*  Trump was the guy who said originally I'm a businessman, not a politician, but I can bring my
*  business smart. Well, Vivek Ramaswamy says the same thing, but he says it in a much more convincing way.
*  He sounds like he has all of the answers. Well, speaking of Trump, Jonathan, I'm curious if
*  Ramaswamy is running a campaign that's basically to the right of Trump. How does he think about his
*  relationship to Trump as a rival in this campaign? He doesn't want to challenge Trump. He doesn't
*  want to alienate Trump's voters. I think his whole theory of the case is that there will be some
*  event that takes Trump down. Maybe he'll be convicted. Maybe he just can't make it through all
*  of these court cases and that Vivek Ramaswamy will be in the position to gobble up all of those
*  Trump supporters because after all, he is more Trump than Trump. A lot of people think Vivek is
*  running to be Donald Trump's vice president. I think he only wants to be president. This is a guy
*  who was a CEO in his early 30s. He only wants to be the guy on top and he thinks that's his destiny.
*  Well, you just outlined that Trump can't run for some reason, can't end up being the nominee. That
*  has been the presumed strategy of other candidates in this race, most notably, of course,
*  Rondasantis, whose policy positions it would seem overlap a fair bit with Ramaswamy. He too,
*  Dacantis is running as an anti-woke isolationist. But Ramaswamy is farther to the right that Rondasantis.
*  He is more personable than Rondasantis, just a much more natural candidate on the campaign trail.
*  And unlike Dacantis, he never criticizes Donald Trump. In fact, he said on the debate stage,
*  he is the greatest president of the 21st century. He has said he will pardon Donald Trump for any
*  convictions or any charges regardless. His only criticism perhaps would be that he can do what
*  Donald Trump wasn't able to do, but that Donald Trump will always be his inspiration.
*  I want to talk about what it means that Rondaswamy is having this breakout moment.
*  With the really important caveat that it's just a moment, that it could change, that he could
*  plunge in the polls as so many hot burning candidates do in crowded Republican fields.
*  But knowing that he's doing this well now, it feels very telling that the two most viable candidates
*  to be the number two in the Republican field are so Trump-like. One, Ramaswamy, so Trump-like
*  that he's to the right of Trump on many issues. And Dacantis a little less so, but likes to see
*  himself as the electable Trump, the Trump without the baggage. If you put all the supporters of Trump,
*  Ramaswamy and Dacantis together, you have a really large chunk of the Republican electorate.
*  And what that seems to suggest is that Trumpism might not just be about Trump at all at this stage,
*  but about just how far rightward the entire Republican Party has shifted over the past few years.
*  When that many candidates are all this conservative, you're clearly no longer just talking about
*  Trump and his base. The Republican Party is now the party of right-wing populism.
*  The old Republican Party of George W. Bush Conservatism is gone. We have candidates trying to run
*  that way in Chris Christie or Aisa Hutchinson or even Mike Pence. But I'm at these events. I talk to
*  these people. They want somebody who is going to reflect their own skepticism and cynicism of where
*  this country is, that sense that they are under assault. And the candidate who really grapples with
*  their own negativity is the one that seems to be getting their allegiance. Right now, that's
*  Donald Trump, but it could be Vivek Ramaswamy who's willing to push dark visions of society into
*  places we never dreamed of. Well Jonathan, thank you very much. You're welcome. Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need.
*  This storm is very strong and is expected to strengthen to a major hurricane by the time it makes
*  landfall. Hurricane Adalia was expected to become a category four strength storm by landfall this
*  morning, delivering potentially catastrophic winds, rain and flooding to Florida's northern Gulf
*  coast. Residents in at least 28 counties were ordered to evacuate their homes mostly because of
*  a storm surge that could reach up to 15 feet. During a news conference at the White House,
*  the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency warned that the hurricane's strength
*  should not be underestimated. This storm will be deadly if we don't get out of harm's way and take
*  it seriously. So I ask all Floridians to be vigilant and heed the warnings of your local officials.
*  If they tell you to evacuate, please do so immediately.
