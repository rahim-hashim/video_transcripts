# A Breakout Moment for Vivek Ramaswamy
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbPL4poxUDU)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. This is a daily.
*  In the Republican presidential race, the battle for second place has been jolted by the sudden
*  rise of a political newcomer whose popularity has already eclipsed that of far more seasoned
*  candidates. Today, my colleague, Jonathan Weisbaum, on the backstory, message, and strategy of
*  Vivek Ramaswamy. It's Wednesday, August 30th.
*  Jonathan, for the past week, the story of the Republican presidential race has been
*  quite unexpectedly the story of Vivek Ramaswamy. Remarkable, huh? Six months ago, Vivek Ramaswamy
*  was, as he says, a skinny little guy with a long name. Nobody knew who he was, but he
*  was out there tilling the soil in Iowa and New Hampshire using his own money, which is
*  copious, and his patented style of saying no to nobody. This is a guy who will be on
*  any TV show, any podcast, any radio show. You ask him, he'll be there. He could do as
*  many as 30 media hits a day. That is really his secret.
*  Right. I remember thinking around the end of the spring that this guy was everywhere.
*  There was a kind of Vivek ubiquity. He was rising in the polls. He was actually moving
*  upward while Ron DeSantis, who was supposed to be the great threat to Donald Trump, is
*  going down in the polls. Suddenly, you're starting to see some guy named Vivek Ramaswamy
*  who is about to overtake the second place Republican in the primaries. It was kind of
*  a jolt. As if to confirm what we were seeing, these memos leaked out from the super PAC
*  that is trying to boost DeSantis' campaign just ahead of what would be the first debate
*  of the 2024 Republican primary season. In those memos, that super PAC says, watch out
*  for Vivek Ramaswamy and hit him hard multiple times when you get onto that stage.
*  Nothing could better confirm that Ramaswamy was having a moment than the campaign apparatus
*  around the guy who was supposed to be having a moment saying, you should be worried about
*  this other person and you should be beating him up.
*  Yeah. Ramaswamy had been saying for months, oh, this is really a two-person race. It's
*  between Donald Trump and me. It always sounded like a joke. Then all of a sudden, these
*  documents emerge that look like they worry about the rise of this guy, Vivek Ramaswamy.
*  Then we get to the debate and we're all expecting that Vivek Ramaswamy will take a hit from
*  Ron DeSantis. We're all watching for it. In fact, Vivek Ramaswamy takes multiple hits
*  from multiple candidates. Every time he proved deft, he somehow bobbed and weaved and turned
*  the debate back on his opponents. He got exactly what he wanted from that debate because he
*  was the guy they were taking seriously. He was confirming to the rest of the world what
*  he had been saying to himself for months, I'm the guy to beat.
*  Right. Suddenly, after that debate, it felt like we were looking at a bona fide breakout
*  moment in this primary for the vague Ramaswamy of what duration and importance we can't say
*  at this moment, but a breakout moment nonetheless. Of course, that's why we wanted to talk to
*  you, Jonathan, because you have been covering Ramaswamy closely for many months, traveling
*  with him across the country. You've gotten to really know him. We want to talk to you
*  about the full Ramaswamy story, not just the momentum of the past few weeks, but a complete
*  portrait of who he is and how he reached this point.
*  So, Vivek Ramaswamy is the child of Indian immigrants who were Brahmins, the highest
*  caste in Indian society. His father was an engineer. He was trained at the MIT of India.
*  His mother is a psychiatrist. They settled in a suburb of Cincinnati. His dad, he likes
*  to say, was a liberal. He liked to talk back to his dad and take the contrarian conservative
*  position. By the time he got to Harvard, he was a libertarian. He actually had a alter
*  ego called DaVake, who was a libertarian rapper. His undergraduate degree is in biology. He
*  got a job out of undergraduate as a stock picker for a prominent hedge fund. He was
*  a biotech guy and told the hedge fund what biotech companies looked promising. Ultimately,
*  that's how he became very, very rich. When he gets out of Yale long enough to get
*  very, very rich. When he gets out of Yale Law School, he starts a company, Royvant,
*  with a really smart idea of combing through the patent files of the big pharmaceutical
*  companies looking for discarded patents that weren't abandoned because they wouldn't necessarily
*  work but were abandoned because they didn't look particularly profitable for a company
*  as big as say Merck. He thought, well, I'm going to buy the patent cheap and I'm going
*  to develop them cheap.
*  You're saying he's basically selling bargain basement patents that everybody else has more
*  or less abandoned.
*  Exactly. He had a lot of success. He was involved in bringing about five different drugs to
*  market, which in the biotech world is a pretty good track record. The drug that really put
*  up on the map was in fact a failure.
*  Mr. Ramaswamy, welcome to Bad Money. Good to see you, sir.
*  A drug to address Alzheimer's.
*  Tell me why Glaxo kind of wrote this drug off and yet you have such great hopes for
*  it.
*  I actually think the potential opportunity here is really tremendous for delivering value
*  to patients.
*  Ramaswamy just went everywhere in the biotech world and pitched this idea that he was going
*  to bring an Alzheimer's drug to market.
*  Actually, we believe we're only one additional phase three study away from the approval of
*  this drug on a global basis.
*  He pumped up the stock price of his company and its subsidiary, AxoVent, way high.
*  When I see a red hot sucker, I don't want to get people hurt. You know that.
*  Absolutely.
*  They got one drug and everyone hopes that it works.
*  I think you're asking all the right questions. Exactly.
*  Fair enough. Okay. Well, we're going to be following the situation.
*  And then lo and behold, it didn't work. It failed. The subsidiary collapsed. A lot of
*  people took a bath. But the way the structure was set up for his company, Ramaswamy did
*  In fact, by the time he's 35, he's made $200 million.
*  Wow. So that sounds a bit like the story of a charismatic salesman telling people what
*  they want to hear, which doesn't seem like that big a stretch or leap from politics.
*  No, exactly. In fact, he was in some ways born to politics. This is a guy who knows
*  how to sell himself.
*  Why does he eventually turn his attention to politics?
*  It goes back to 2020 and the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted after George Floyd's murder.
*  Remember, at that time, CEOs from companies large and small were speaking out in favor
*  of the Black Lives Matter protesters and against systemic racism, against police violence.
*  And Ramaswamy wasn't insulated from those trends. In fact, he was under pressure from employees
*  of his company, Royvant, to be out there to speak out. And he said, no, it is not the role of a chief
*  executive officer of a company with fiduciary responsibilities to its shareholders to get
*  involved in politics at all. Now joining me, Vivek Ramaswamy, big corporate entities, embracing
*  woke politics whole cloth. Why? Big business in this country decided to enter an arranged marriage
*  with the new woke left. And it's more like mutual prostitution because each side gets something out
*  of the trade. He started appearing on Fox News. But these woke values are really easy. They love
*  anti-racism because they could applaud diversity and inclusion, put some token minorities on their
*  boards. He alienated a lot of very big name Democrats who were advisors to his company.
*  And he also alienated some of the employees of his company, so much so that within months of his
*  first commentary in public, he had stepped back, left as CEO, and was writing a book called Woke
*  Inc., a jeremiad against liberal politics in corporate board suites.
*  He follows up his first book, Woke Inc. with two other books and translates that to a lot of
*  appearances on Fox News, on Fox Business. He starts making a name for himself in conservative
*  circles, and he decides, I want to run for president. And he seems to be driven by his
*  And he seems to be driven by his fear of wokeism from the left, that society's under assault
*  from liberal activism. And when he finally announces his run for president, he does so
*  with a vision for this country and its society that is extremely dark.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Jonathan, tell us more about this dark message at the heart of
*  Ramoswami's eventual presidential campaign. Well, nothing captures that message more
*  than the video that launched him. We're in the middle of a national identity crisis.
*  Faith, patriotism, and hard work have disappeared. He speaks of a hole in our soul, a darkness
*  in the American society. We hunger to be part of something bigger than ourselves,
*  yet we cannot even answer the question of what it means to be an American.
*  Today, the woke left preys on that vacuum. They tell you that your race, your gender,
*  and your sexual orientation govern who you are, what you can achieve, and what you're allowed to
*  think. This is psychological slavery. And his message is that he can bring the country back
*  from this morass. And that is why today I am announcing my run for president of the United
*  States. This isn't just a political campaign. This is a cultural movement to create a new
*  American dream for the next generation. Jonathan, some of this candidly feels a bit familiar for
*  the Republican Party in the era of Donald Trump, who has long railed, for instance, against political
*  correctness and woke culture. So what in your mind, and I guess in Ramoswami's mind, makes
*  this distinct? You know, it's not just his diagnosis of what Donald Trump called American carnage.
*  It's his remedy. It's the details to actually do something about it that pulls his agenda
*  much farther to the right of Donald Trump. Hmm. Explain that. Well, for instance, remember,
*  Donald Trump kind of invented the notion of the deep state. Well, Ramoswami talks about the
*  administrative state, and he says that he would do things that Trump never dreamed of.
*  The people who we elect to run the government ought to be the ones who actually run the government.
*  He's talking about cutting 75% of the federal workforce,
*  eliminating the Department of Education, the IRS, the FBI. He's talking about gutting the
*  administrative state, not just railing against it. We will shut them down. And that's just the very
*  beginning of his agenda. So on the first day of my campaign, I pledged to do something,
*  which is to use US military force if necessary to address the Mexican drug cartels, who yes,
*  are terrorist organizations. This is a guy who talks about taking US troops and actually attacking
*  Mexican cartels in Mexico. Well, I don't think citizenship should be something that anybody
*  automatically takes for granted, born here or not. He talks about ending birthright citizenship,
*  which would mean that the children of undocumented immigrants born on US soil would no longer be
*  American citizens. Why are you against the Boarding of Green? Because it does not advance American
*  interests. And as the US president, I'm not running for any other role other than looking
*  after the interests of Americans. And then, if anything, his foreign policy is even farther to
*  the right. Certainly a swing toward isolationism. He talks about not giving another dime of military
*  aid to Ukraine, but he even goes farther. I would freeze the current lines of control and that would
*  leave parts of the Donbas region with Russia. He says he would give Vladimir Putin Eastern Ukraine.
*  Our engagement in Ukraine is further driving Russia into China's arms. So my foreign policy
*  centers on weakening that alliance. He says we need to make friends with Vladimir Putin. He doesn't
*  trust Putin, but he wants to woo Putin away from China. And to do that, he's willing to
*  give up the sovereignty of a would be ally Ukraine. And if we rediscover who we really are,
*  then we can actually stand up to the actual threats we face on the global stage. And the top of the
*  list, it isn't in Ukraine, it is communist China. And he talks about that the most important piece
*  of his foreign policy is to confront China and to break the United States' dependence on China.
*  That is our number one threat that we face in the next century.
*  Similarly, he seems ready to give up on Taiwan. We are dependent on a tiny island nation
*  off the southeast coast of China for our entire modern way of life in the United States of America.
*  He's actually said out loud many times that he would spend the first four years of his presidency
*  building up the domestic semiconductor industry. So we would no longer be dependent on Taiwan for
*  semiconductors. And then at the end of those four years, he would no longer defend Taiwan,
*  basically signaling to Beijing, take it, it's yours. And we will not take the risk of war
*  that risks American lives after that, for some nationalistic dispute between China and Taiwan.
*  Wow. And then that leads to actually perhaps maybe his most controversial position,
*  at least in Republican politics, he'd like to further the bilateral peace agreements that
*  Israel is pursuing with its neighbors, so he can stop giving military aid to Israel. Now,
*  aid to Israel is sacrosanct in the Republican Party, but he's saying, you know, eventually,
*  we don't need to do that either.
*  Jonathan, you started to hint at this, but these are extremely unorthodox views of American foreign
*  policy, period. And especially for a Republican when it comes to Taiwan and Israel defending those
*  two have been pillars of modern Republican foreign policy. So what do you make of that?
*  Well, it's not only radical, but if you just look under the surface, some of this doesn't make a
*  lot of sense. I mean, he says that we're going to confront China in every way, but that somehow,
*  we will have four years to build up a semiconductor industry so China can have Taiwan.
*  That doesn't make a lot of sense for a confrontation. But also, how does he know
*  that in four years, we'll be able to build up a semiconductor industry that's totally
*  independent of Taiwan? How does he know that China won't invade before four years? It's like,
*  the world doesn't work the way he wants it to, but he's almost willing it to work the way he wants it
*  to. Right. You're saying the arguments don't add up. They're flawed. And they are not representative
*  of someone who's really understood geopolitics. I mean, this has led foreign policy experts,
*  including conservative foreign policy experts, to say that Vivek Ramaswamy is just engaged in
*  bizarre magical thinking. Remember on the debate stage, Nikki Haley looked at him and said,
*  you don't know what you're talking about. You've never conducted foreign policy and it shows.
*  If ideas like this don't make sense, why is Ramaswamy even articulating that? I mean,
*  it's not clear to me that Republican voters need him to make a four-part argument around Taiwan
*  that results in it being given back to China. So why is he even treading there? What you need to
*  know about Vivek Ramaswamy is that he has this quality about him that anticipates what people
*  want to hear and gives them what they want, whether it's the truth or not. I remember being
*  in New Hampshire and a woman stood up and said that she really didn't like all this anti-wokeism
*  that seemed beside the point to her. And he said, oh, I'm not really into that stuff anymore. But
*  in the back of the room, they were giving out little buttons that said, stop woke ism vote Vivek.
*  Wait, how could you not be into woke ism? That's his whole campaign. That's his whole campaign.
*  And yet he said he's not into it anymore. He says these things a lot. I remember following him to
*  the South Side of Chicago. He was there to talk about his immigration policies because they were
*  settling migrants shipped up from Texas in the South Side and the community was getting upset.
*  He thought he was going to be able to stir the pot with Black Chicagoans about this, but they
*  were much more interested in really peppering him on his opposition to affirmative action,
*  on his belief that there's no such thing as systemic racism. And then nobody asked about
*  immigration, just nobody. And I was in Iowa just a few days ago and he had this shtick where he said,
*  nowhere were they more interested in my immigration policies and my promise to go
*  after the cartels than in the South Side of Chicago in an all Black audience.
*  I remember writing in my notes, this is a lie. Wow. So it's clear that his message has a radical
*  quality to it. The content of what he's saying can at times strain logic and practicality.
*  You're spending all this time with him out in the field. How are voters that you're talking to and
*  watching receiving all of this messaging and content? The thing about Vivek Ramaswamy is that
*  he exudes confidence so much that whatever he says sounds correct. He speaks with such clarity
*  that he doesn't invite you to analyze whether what he said was logical or not.
*  And I remember everywhere I go, I talk to people after his events and they always say,
*  he is so brilliant. They are convinced that whatever he said had to be right because he
*  said it so well. Hmm. I mean, it sounds like his success as a salesman in biotech is very naturally
*  translating into selling the idea of himself as president on the campaign trail. It is remarkable
*  because obviously Donald Trump was the guy who said originally, I'm a businessman, not a politician,
*  but I can bring my business smart. Well, Vivek Ramaswamy says the same thing, but he says it in
*  a much more convincing way. He sounds like he has all of the answers. Well, speaking of Trump,
*  Jonathan, I'm curious if Ramaswamy is running a campaign that's basically to the right of Trump.
*  How does he think about his relationship to Trump as a rival in this campaign? He doesn't want to
*  challenge Trump. He doesn't want to alienate Trump's voters. I think his whole theory of the
*  case is that there will be some event that takes Trump down. Maybe he'll be convicted. Maybe he just
*  can't make it through all of these court cases and that Vivek Ramaswamy will be in the position
*  to gobble up all of those Trump supporters because after all, he is more Trump than Trump.
*  A lot of people think Vivek is running to be Donald Trump's vice president. I think he only
*  wants to be president. This is a guy who was a CEO in his early thirties. He only wants to be the
*  guy on top and he thinks that's his destiny. What you just outlined that Trump can't run for some
*  reason, can't end up being the nominee. That has been the presumed strategy of other candidates
*  in this race. Most notably, of course, Rondesantis, whose policy positions it would seem overlap a
*  fair bit with Ramaswamy. He too, DeSantis, is running as an anti-woke isolationist.
*  But Ramaswamy is farther to the right than Rondesantis. He is more personable than
*  Rondesantis, just a much more natural candidate on the campaign trail. Unlike DeSantis, he never
*  criticizes Donald Trump. In fact, he said on the debate stage, he is the greatest president of the
*  21st century. He has said he will pardon Donald Trump for any convictions or any charges, regardless.
*  His only criticism perhaps would be that he can do what Donald Trump wasn't able to do,
*  but that Donald Trump will always be his inspiration. I want to talk about what it
*  means that Ramaswamy is having this breakout moment with the really important caveat that
*  it's just a moment, that it could change, that he could plunge in the polls as so many
*  hot burning candidates do in crowded Republican fields. But knowing that he's doing this well now,
*  it feels very telling that the two most viable candidates to be the number two in the Republican
*  field are so Trump-like, right? I mean, one, Ramaswamy, so Trump-like that he's to the right
*  of Trump on many issues, and DeSantis, a little less so, but likes to see himself as the electable
*  Trump, the Trump without the baggage. If you put all the supporters of Trump, Ramaswamy,
*  and DeSantis together, you have a really large chunk of the Republican electorate. And what
*  that seems to suggest is that Trumpism might not just be about Trump at all at this stage,
*  but about just how far rightward the entire Republican Party has shifted over the past few
*  years. When that many candidates are all this conservative, you're clearly no longer just
*  talking about Trump and his base. The Republican Party is now the party of right-wing populism.
*  The old Republican Party of George W. Bush conservatism is gone. We have candidates trying
*  to run that way in Chris Christie or Asa Hutchinson or even Mike Pence. But I'm at these events. I
*  talk to these people. They want somebody who is going to reflect their own skepticism and
*  cynicism of where this country is, that sense that they are under assault. And the candidate who
*  really grapples with their own negativity is the one that seems to be getting their allegiance.
*  Right now, that's Donald Trump, but it could be Vivek Ramaswamy, who's willing to push dark
*  visions of society into places we never dreamed of. Well, Jonathan, thank you very much.
*  You're welcome. Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  This storm is very strong and is expected to strengthen to a major hurricane by the time it
*  makes landfall. Hurricane Adalia was expected to become a category four strength storm by landfall
*  this morning, delivering potentially catastrophic winds, rain and flooding to Florida's northern
*  Gulf Coast. Residents in at least 28 counties were ordered to evacuate their homes, mostly because
*  of a storm surge that could reach up to 15 feet. During a news conference at the White House,
*  the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency warned that the hurricane strength should
*  not be underestimated. This storm will be deadly if we don't get out of harm's way and take it
*  seriously. So I ask all Floridians to be vigilant and heed the warnings of your local officials.
*  If they tell you to evacuate, please do so immediately.
*  Thank you.
