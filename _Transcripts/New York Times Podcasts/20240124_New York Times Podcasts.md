# Why the G.O.P. Nomination Fight Is Now (All But) Over
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxrAptgA8-E)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, the real meaning of Donald Trump's victory last night in the New Hampshire Republican
*  primary.
*  I spoke with Times political correspondent, Jonathan Weisman.
*  This Wednesday, January 24th.
*  Jonathan, are you rolling?
*  I'm rolling.
*  I'm right here.
*  Okay, very good.
*  So it is at this very moment, 1103 PM, and we have almost the full results of the New
*  Hampshire primary.
*  I think 70 some percent of the votes are in.
*  So just walk us through the top line numbers.
*  So it looks like Donald Trump has beat Nikki Haley in New Hampshire by about 10 and a half,
*  11 percentage points.
*  That's certainly not the kind of blowout that we saw in Iowa.
*  It's not even as bad as some of the late polling that had her down more like 15, 16 percentage
*  points.
*  For Nikki Haley, a loss is a loss.
*  She really needed to pull New Hampshire out, and it only gets a lot more difficult from
*  here.
*  And look what Trump won.
*  He won women.
*  He won men.
*  He won Republicans.
*  He won conservative Republicans.
*  He pretty much did what he did in Iowa, which was to show that he has control over the Republican
*  electorate.
*  Right.
*  And now, I think the question on everyone's mind, let's just cut to the chase, is whether
*  this nomination battle is basically now over.
*  Did Trump just end Nikki Haley's candidacy effectively?
*  Thank you, New Hampshire, for the love, the kindness, the support and a great night here
*  tonight.
*  So after the race was called, Nikki Haley came out to her after party, I'll call it,
*  and she said.
*  You've all heard the chatter among the political class.
*  They're falling all over themselves saying this race is over.
*  Well, I have news for all of them.
*  That New Hampshire primary is the beginning of this process, not the end of this process.
*  This race is far from over.
*  There are dozens of states left to go.
*  And the next one is my sweet state of South Carolina.
*  When she vowed she'll stay in the race.
*  South Carolina voters don't want a coronation.
*  They want an election.
*  And we're going to give them one because we are just getting started.
*  Thank you for the energy.
*  Right.
*  And I think we have all observed in this primary and in pretty much every primary I've covered,
*  Jonathan, you've covered as well, that candidates say they are in the race and suddenly they're
*  not in a heartbeat.
*  We saw that with Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio in 2016.
*  We saw that with Ron DeSantis just a few days ago.
*  Just a few days ago.
*  Remember, DeSantis said he is not going to kneel down and kiss the ring.
*  And then just days later, he knelt down and kissed the ring.
*  So yes, just because a candidate is saying she is going to keep going doesn't necessarily
*  mean she will.
*  She has to take stock and decide whether it is good for her.
*  So I'll ask this question again.
*  Is this race effectively over?
*  Has Donald Trump, for all intents and purposes, wrapped up, not officially, but in kind of
*  the political, realpolitik of this race, the Republican nomination?
*  Yes.
*  Donald Trump will be the nominee of the Republican Party, barring some miraculous intervention
*  that won't involve Nikki Haley at this point.
*  Well, let's talk, Jonathan, about why this played out the way that it did in New Hampshire.
*  Because if you rewind the clock just a few days ago, a political lifetime ago, our understanding
*  was that this was supposed to be a three-person race in New Hampshire.
*  A three-person race that would, we predicted, be focused on the battle for number two.
*  That's where we left our listeners off a week ago when we talked to Shane Goldmacher with
*  the sense that unless either Haley or Ron DeSantis dropped out, they would just muck
*  up each other's path to being competitive with Trump.
*  DeSantis, as we just talked about, drops out in the middle of this past week, a theoretical
*  boon to Nikki Haley, and yet she lost by something like 10 points.
*  So just untangle that for us.
*  Well, let's look at Ron DeSantis.
*  By the time DeSantis dropped out, he hardly had any voters, six percentage points.
*  In New Hampshire.
*  In New Hampshire, I'm sorry.
*  And almost all of DeSantis' voters said that their second choice wasn't Nikki Haley.
*  Their second choice was Donald Trump.
*  I actually think that DeSantis' departure was kind of a stab in the back to Nikki Haley.
*  DeSantis not only left two days before the election in New Hampshire, but he endorsed
*  Trump and he went out with a blast against the corporatist Nikki Haley.
*  He didn't want his voters to go to her.
*  So that was a big blow.
*  Even though she got the two person race she wanted, we saw Trump's numbers go up, not
*  down.
*  But regardless of what DeSantis' supporters did or didn't have to offer Haley, why then
*  Haley's own strategy end up working at all in New Hampshire where she has been on the
*  rise?
*  She campaigned a tremendous amount and where her campaign said she was a natural fit for
*  this primary electorate.
*  So what made her campaign think that, say that and why didn't it ultimately bear out?
*  40%, the largest chunk of the electorate in New Hampshire is unaffiliated, independent,
*  not connected to the Democratic or the Republican Party.
*  40%, that is a big chunk.
*  And the assumption was that most of those 40%, the ones that wanted to vote in the Republican
*  primary were going to go to Nikki Haley.
*  And Nikki Haley had a template.
*  She could have looked back at John McCain's campaign in 2000 to see how you energize these
*  unaffiliated voters, how you get folks that aren't really tied to a political party or
*  an ideology decided with you.
*  And that template is to actually reach out to them in a big way to say, I want independent
*  voters.
*  I want a big tent.
*  Voters in New Hampshire, especially independents, really want authenticity.
*  They want access.
*  McCain in 2000, he would do these town hall meetings that would go on and on and on until
*  everybody had asked every question that they could come up with.
*  There was never a question of him hiding.
*  He was out there.
*  He was taking risks.
*  Nikki Haley, she would go into like a diner.
*  She would give a 15 minute stump speech and then she would leave.
*  Sometimes she would say, I'm going to take questions today.
*  And she would take literally like five questions.
*  If that, that wasn't what New Hampshire wanted to see.
*  They wanted access.
*  They wanted authenticity.
*  And she just never offered it up.
*  I was talking to an independent from Dover, New Hampshire a few days ago, and he had told
*  me, you know, I really wanted Chris Christie.
*  With Christie out of the race, I'll vote for Nikki Haley.
*  I don't love her, but I do want to stop Donald Trump.
*  Well, he reached out to me today and he said, I don't know if you're going to do a follow
*  up story, but I decided I just can't vote for Nikki Haley.
*  I'm going to go and write in Joe Biden's name.
*  And I said, why?
*  And he said, you know, Nikki Haley never asked me for my vote.
*  She never gave me a compelling reason for me to vote for her.
*  And if she's not going to do that, I'm not going to.
*  Fascinating.
*  So how did Haley's failure and this telling to follow that template and truly persuade
*  independents in New Hampshire to come to her?
*  How did that ultimately manifest in the final numbers we saw on Tuesday night?
*  Haley won independents.
*  No question.
*  She won them, but she didn't win them by the overwhelming majorities that she needed to.
*  So she also had the other side of the equation.
*  She needed to win a good number of Republicans because ultimately she's running for the Republican
*  nomination and she didn't do it.
*  Donald Trump absolutely overwhelmingly crushed her with Republicans, especially with Republicans
*  who identified themselves as conservatives.
*  It really showed her fundamental weakness because New Hampshire is not as conservative
*  a Republican base as she's going to be facing in South Carolina and for much of the country,
*  actually.
*  It's a pretty moderate Republican base, but she didn't really win those people either.
*  If you were an identified Republican, you almost certainly voted for Donald Trump.
*  And you can't win the Republican nomination without Republican votes.
*  And just put a number around that.
*  How much did Trump essentially crush her among Republicans here?
*  The numbers are overwhelming.
*  Trump won about three quarters, three out of four Republicans who went to vote voted
*  for Donald J. Trump.
*  Which is really interesting because what that would seem to tell us was that Nikki Haley's
*  44% or so second place finish in New Hampshire is kind of misleading because so much of it
*  is, as you have gotten at, unique to the scale of independent voters in that state.
*  And the reality is she did pretty poorly among Republicans who make up the rest of the primary
*  season electorate that she's going to have to contend with in the next few races.
*  And all of that makes a certain sense given that her campaign became increasingly anti-Trump,
*  whose main appeal was to the faction of Republicans ready to move on from Donald Trump, which
*  turned out in a place like New Hampshire to be smaller than the group of Republicans that
*  very much want him to be the nominee.
*  Yes, from a message standpoint, she was really in a bind.
*  Remember, she first started this as pretty respectful of Trump.
*  But she said, you know, it's time to turn the page.
*  It's time for a new generation of leadership.
*  I'm the new face of the Republican Party.
*  She started being a little more critical of him on policy and talking about he ran up
*  the debt by eight trillion dollars.
*  He's leaving behind our allies in Ukraine.
*  That didn't work very well either.
*  Then she started sharpening her message about Trump personally.
*  And by the end, she was talking about Donald Trump as an agent of chaos with a brain that
*  seemed to be adling.
*  I mean, she was getting tougher, and that didn't work either, because the harder you
*  go at Trump, the bigger the backlash is against you.
*  But if you don't go at Trump, people will say, well, why are you even running?
*  I'll vote for the original guy.
*  Right.
*  And if you're an independent, why would I turn to you at all if you're not willing to
*  criticize Trump?
*  And so, Jonathan, what we have witnessed, stepping back over the past two nomination
*  contests, Iowa Now New Hampshire, is that you can't beat Trump by running as his political
*  heir, which DeSantis tried.
*  Didn't work.
*  You can't beat Trump by running as ultimately his nemesis or critic, which Nikki Haley just
*  tried.
*  You just can't beat him as a Republican pretty much, period.
*  Yes.
*  This is Donald Trump's party.
*  And that's why, after tonight, Donald Trump has this Republican nomination wrapped up.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Jonathan, with the caveat that Nikki Haley does remain in the Republican race for however
*  long she decides to stay in it, we are now effectively in the very strange position of
*  a general election that basically begins now, 10 months before Election Day.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know what's really crazy about it is it feels to voters like these are two incumbent
*  presidents.
*  You have an incumbent president in Joe Biden running against a former president who was
*  only president less than four years ago in Donald Trump.
*  And people are making a judgment based on what kind of presidents they were.
*  It feels like an incumbent on incumbent election already.
*  And we should say this is a general election that improbably pits not just two incumbents,
*  as you're describing, but the exact same two candidates who ran against each other four
*  years ago, one of whom sought to overturn the results of that last election, 2020, and
*  is now relying on that same system to elevate him to become his party's nominee and then
*  will seek to have that same system elect him president.
*  And that race, that last race where Biden faced Trump and its aftermath, was a complete
*  national trauma.
*  And yet our political system is recreating that same race.
*  Yeah.
*  And remember, after January 6th, the Republican Party had their moment.
*  They could have been done with Donald Trump.
*  At that time, this would-be Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, went down to the floor
*  of the House to actually say, no, we are not going to support the impeachment of Donald
*  Trump.
*  Then we had Mitch McConnell going to the well of the Senate.
*  He had the opportunity to convict Trump in that impeachment.
*  And after the conviction, the Senate could have easily voted with just a simple majority
*  to bar Trump from ever holding federal office again.
*  Instead, they acquitted him.
*  So here we are now, and the entire Republican apparatus is coalescing around him.
*  They're looking at the Republican electorate and saying, well, if you can't beat him, join
*  him.
*  We saw Tim Scott right behind Trump in his victory speech.
*  We saw John Cornyn, who might be the next Senate Majority Leader from Texas, endorsing
*  Trump.
*  We saw people like Representative Nancy Mace from South Carolina, who endorses Trump over
*  Nikki Haley.
*  And it's not because Nikki Haley has alienated all these people.
*  They don't hate her.
*  They just see the handwriting on the wall and they fear crossing Donald Trump.
*  They feel like now is the time they have to unite behind the eventual nominee.
*  Right.
*  We should say on the other side of a 2024 ballot and contributing to this rematch we're
*  talking about is a Democratic Party apparatus and leadership that decided that Joe Biden
*  should be the nominee again.
*  And they worked pretty tirelessly to ensure that there would not be a robust fight over
*  that question.
*  And so we now end up with a Democratic nominee that has real questions around his popularity
*  in a general election against Trump, who has real questions about his popularity against
*  Biden.
*  It is a truism that incumbent presidents are very difficult to defeat.
*  They almost always win reelection.
*  And it was kind of natural for the Democratic Party apparatus, its leadership to rally around
*  Joe Biden as the incumbent.
*  But this is a weak incumbent.
*  You can look at any polling.
*  You can see he's weak with young voters.
*  He's weak with progressive voters who right now are very angry at the war in Gaza.
*  He's weak with black voters who were really stung by inflation and feel like they didn't
*  get all the things that they were promised.
*  And he's really weakened among Hispanic voters.
*  He is looking like a weak incumbent.
*  And yet the party powers rallied around him.
*  And now we have two candidates running for president that are not particularly popular
*  with the American people.
*  Despite that, though, I wonder if there is a way of looking at tonight's results in New
*  Hampshire, just to go back to the main event here, as any kind of a positive development
*  for President Biden.
*  If once Nikki Haley does eventually drop out of this race, does it feel correct or at all
*  safe to assume that at least some of her supporters, especially these independent voters, might
*  be comfortable voting for President Biden in a general election?
*  Many of them have told our colleagues that they couldn't stomach voting for Trump.
*  And this is for all kinds of reasons, right?
*  For January 6th, because of Trump's conduct, because of his criminal liability and so on.
*  And therefore, what Nikki Haley did well in New Hampshire bodes pretty well for Biden
*  in November and pretty poorly for Trump.
*  Is that how we should think about this?
*  When I look at Nikki Haley's 44% of New Hampshire, I don't think that's great news for Nikki
*  Haley.
*  I think it is really great news for Joe Biden.
*  The fact is, Iowa is not a swing state.
*  New Hampshire is a swing state.
*  And I look at those Haley voters and see a lot of potential support for Joe Biden.
*  I mean, the fact is, we talked to a whole lot of independent voters in New Hampshire
*  who said they're going to vote for Nikki Haley because they wanted to stop Donald Trump.
*  But they fully acknowledged they plan to vote for Joe Biden in the fall.
*  I think that what we see in those Haley voters in the exit polling is a real fear of another
*  Trump term.
*  And that fear is going to show up in a movement toward Joe Biden.
*  That being said, we don't know what all these Haley voters are going to do in November.
*  Some of them might fall in line with Donald Trump, just the way so many other people do.
*  Some might just not go out and vote at all in November because they don't like their
*  choices and they don't have to make one of the choices.
*  Right. And to that point on this night where we feel like we can say that this Republican
*  nomination contest is basically over and that the general election has commenced, the reality
*  is that polling right now, national polling, swing state polling, shows this to be an
*  excruciatingly close general election race.
*  Yes, it's 10 months out, but the closeness of it is kind of extraordinary.
*  And those same polls tell us, each and every one, that voters, especially those who may
*  end up being decisive in this election, are just not happy with their choices.
*  Most Americans did not want a rematch between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
*  And that's leading to this real sense of dread, a fear of what is going to be coming over the
*  next nine, 10 months.
*  And even a denial.
*  You hear it all the time.
*  Republicans saying, oh, Joe Biden isn't really going to be the nominee.
*  Somehow there's some magical thing that he's going to pull that the Democrats are going to
*  put up someone else.
*  Or you talk to Democrats and they say, oh, there's no way Donald Trump's not really going
*  to be the nominee.
*  Somehow, maybe he'll be put in prison.
*  It could happen.
*  Maybe he'll be knocked off the ballot by a constitutional intervention.
*  But the fact is, underneath it all, everybody is really afraid about what is brewing for this
*  coming election.
*  Right.
*  What you're really saying is that there's some wishful thinking happening right now on the part
*  of both parties.
*  And it's born out of this sense of denial that you are diagnosing in the electorate.
*  People are so determined to avoid this in their heads and in their worlds that they're
*  basically engaging in fantastical thinking.
*  We don't know what's going to be actually going on in this country by the time we actually vote
*  for the next president.
*  But right now, nobody wants this contest.
*  And how both of these candidates navigate that dread and perhaps propagate that dread
*  could determine who is victorious on November 2nd.
*  Well, Jonathan, it is now Wednesday morning.
*  Get some sleep.
*  Thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you for having me, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to another day.
*  We found some loose bolts on many of our Max 9s.
*  Many.
*  Yeah.
*  So those are things that are going to be rectified through the inspection process.
*  In an interview on Tuesday with NBC News, the CEO of Alaska Airlines disclosed that
*  the company has found loose bolts on the doors of multiple Boeing Max 9 jets in its fleet.
*  It was a startling revelation from an airline that experienced a blown-out door on a Boeing
*  Max 9 mid-flight earlier this month.
*  In the interview, Alaska CEO Ben Minicucci publicly rebuked Boeing for the problem.
*  It makes me angry.
*  Boeing is better than this.
*  Flight 128 should never have happened.
*  Should never have happened.
*  And the film Oppenheimer, the subject of Yesterday's Daily, won 13 Oscar nominations on Tuesday,
*  the most by far of any film released last year.
*  The movie, which tells the story of the race to build the atomic bomb,
*  won nominations for best director, best actor, and best cinematography,
*  among others, and is now the front runner for best picture.
*  Today's episode was produced by Astha Chaturvedi, Alex Starr, and Michael Simon Johnson.
*  It was edited by Rachel Quester and M.J. Davis Lynn, and was engineered by Alyssa Moxley,
*  and contains original music from Marian Lozano and Dan Powell.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landsfer of Wonderly.
*  That's it for the Daily.
