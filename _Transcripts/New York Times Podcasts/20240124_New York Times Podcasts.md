*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Borrow. This is The Daily.
*  Today, the real meaning of Donald Trump's victory last night in the New Hampshire Republican
*  primary. I spoke with Times' political correspondent, Jonathan Weisman.
*  It's Wednesday, January 24th.
*  Jonathan, are you rolling? I'm rolling. I'm right here. Okay, very good. So it is at this
*  very moment, 11.03 pm, and we have almost the full results of the New Hampshire primary.
*  I think 70-some percent of the votes are in. So just walk us through the top line numbers.
*  So it looks like Donald Trump has beat Nikki Haley in New Hampshire by about 10.5-11 percentage
*  points. That's certainly not the kind of blowout that we saw in Iowa. It's not even as
*  bad as some of the late polling that had her down more like 15-16 percentage points.
*  But for Nikki Haley, a loss is a loss. She really needed to pull New Hampshire out, and it
*  only gets a lot more difficult from here. And look what Trump won. He won women. He won
*  men. He won Republicans. He won conservative Republicans. He pretty much did what he
*  did in Iowa, which was to show that he has control over the Republican electorate. Right.
*  And now I think the question on everyone's mind, let's just go to the chase, is whether
*  this nomination battle is basically now over. Did Trump just end Nikki Haley's candidacy
*  effectively?
*  Thank you, New Hampshire, for the love, the kindness of support, and a great night here
*  tonight. Thank you so much.
*  So after the race was called, Nikki Haley came out to her after party, I'll call it, and
*  she said, now you've all heard the chatter among the political class. They're falling
*  all over themselves, saying this race is over. Well, I have news for all of them.
*  But New Hampshire primary is the beginning of this process, not the end of this process.
*  This race is far from over. There are dozens of states left to go. And the next one is
*  my sweet state of South Carolina. And she vowed she'll stay in the race.
*  South Carolina voters don't want a coronation. They want an election. And we're going to
*  give them because we are just getting started. Thank you for the energy.
*  Right. And I think we have all observed in this primary and in pretty much every primary.
*  I've covered Jonathan. You've covered as well that candidates say they are in the race.
*  And suddenly they're not in a heartbeat. We saw that with Jeb Bush, Merger Rubio in 2016.
*  We saw that with Ron DeSantis just a few days ago.
*  Remember DeSantis said he is not going to kneel down and kiss the ring.
*  And then just days later he knelt down and kiss the ring.
*  So yes, just because a candidate is saying she is going to keep going doesn't necessarily
*  mean she will. She has to take stock and decide whether it is good for her.
*  So I'll ask this question again. Is this race effectively over? Has Donald Trump for
*  all intents and purposes wrapped up not officially, but in kind of the political re-alpolitik of
*  this race, the Republican nomination? Yes. Donald Trump will be the nominee of the Republican
*  party, barring some miraculous intervention that won't involve Nikki Haley at this point.
*  Well, let's talk Jonathan about why this played out the way that it did in New Hampshire.
*  Because if you rewind the clock just a few days ago, a political lifetime ago, our understanding
*  was that this was supposed to be a three person race in New Hampshire, a three person race
*  that would we predicted, be focused on the battle for number two. That's where we left
*  our listeners off a week ago when we talked to Shane Goldmacher with the sense that unless
*  either Haley or Ron DeSantis dropped out, they would just muck up each other's path
*  to being competitive with Trump. DeSantis, as we just talked about, drops out in the middle
*  of this past week, a theoretical boon to Nikki Haley. And yet, she lost by something like
*  10 points. So just untangle that for us.
*  Well, let's look at Ron DeSantis. I mean, by the time DeSantis dropped out, he hardly had
*  any voters, six percentage points in New Hampshire. In New Hampshire, I'm sorry. And almost all
*  of DeSantis's voters said that their second choice wasn't Nikki Haley. Their second choice
*  was Donald Trump. I actually think that DeSantis's departure was kind of a stab in the back to
*  Nikki Haley. DeSantis not only left two days before the election in New Hampshire, but he endorsed
*  Trump and he went out with a blast against the corporatist Nikki Haley. He didn't want his
*  voters to go to her. So that was a big blow. Even though she got the two person race, she wanted.
*  We saw Trump's numbers go up, not down. But regardless of what DeSantis's supporters did or didn't
*  have to offer Haley, why then didn't Haley's own strategy end up working at all in New Hampshire,
*  where she has been on the rise. She campaigned a tremendous amount. And where her campaign
*  said she was a natural fit for this primary electorate. So what made her campaign think that
*  say that and why didn't it ultimately bear out? 40% the largest chunk of the electorate in New
*  Hampshire is unaffiliated, independent, not connected to the Democratic or the Republican party.
*  40% that is a big chunk. And the assumption was that most of those 40% the ones that wanted to
*  vote in the Republican primary were going to go to Nikki Haley. And Nikki Haley had a template.
*  She could have looked back at John McCain's campaign in 2000 to see how you energize
*  these unaffiliated voters, how you get folks that aren't really tied to a political party or an
*  ideology decided with you. And that template is to actually reach out to them in a big way to say,
*  I want independent voters. I want a big tent. You know, voters in New Hampshire, especially
*  independence, really want authenticity. They want access. McCain in 2000, he would do these town hall
*  meetings that would go on and on and on until everybody had asked every question that they could
*  come up with. There was never a question of him hiding. He was out there. He was taking risks.
*  Right. Nikki Haley, she would go into like a diner. She would give a 15 minutes stump speech.
*  And then she would leave. Sometimes she would say, I'm going to take questions today. And she would
*  take literally like five questions. If that, that wasn't what New Hampshire wanted to see. They wanted
*  access. They wanted authenticity. And she just never offered it up. You know, I was talking to an
*  independent from Dover, New Hampshire a few days ago. And he had told me, you know, I really wanted
*  Chris Christie. But with Christie out of the race, I'll vote for Nikki Haley. I don't love her,
*  but I do want to stop Donald Trump. Well, he reached out to me today. And he said, I don't know if
*  you're going to do a follow up story. But I decided I just can't vote for Nikki Haley. I'm going to
*  go and write in Joe Biden's name. And I said, why? And he said, you know, Nikki Haley never asked
*  me for my vote. She never gave me a compelling reason for me to vote for her. And if she's not going
*  to do that, I'm not going to fastening. So how did Haley's failure and is telling to follow that
*  template and truly persuade independence and New Hampshire to come to her? How did the ultimately
*  manifest in the final numbers we saw on Tuesday night? Haley won independence. No question. She won
*  them. But she didn't win them by the overwhelming majorities that she needed to. So she also had the
*  other side of the equation. She needed to win a good number of Republicans because ultimately,
*  she's running for the Republican nomination. Right. And she didn't do it. Donald Trump absolutely
*  overwhelmingly crushed her with Republicans, especially with Republicans who identified themselves
*  as conservatives. It really showed her fundamental weakness because New Hampshire is not as conservative
*  a Republican base as she's going to be facing in South Carolina. And for much of the country,
*  actually, it's a pretty moderate Republican base. But she didn't really win those people either.
*  If you're an identified Republican, you almost certainly voted for Donald Trump. Right. And
*  you can't win the Republican nomination without Republican votes. And just put a number around
*  that. How much did Trump essentially crush her among Republicans here? The numbers are overwhelming.
*  Trump won about three quarters, three out of four Republicans who went to vote voted for Donald
*  J. Trump, which is really interesting because what that would seem to tell us was that
*  Niki Haley's 44% or so second place finish in New Hampshire is kind of misleading because so much
*  of it is as you have gotten at unique to the scale of independent voters in that state. And the
*  reality is she did pretty poorly among Republicans who make up the rest of the primary season electorate
*  that she's going to have to contend with in the next few races. And all of that makes a certain
*  sense given that her campaign became increasingly anti-Trump whose main appeal was to the faction of
*  Republicans ready to move on from Donald Trump, which turned out in place like New Hampshire to be
*  smaller than the group of Republicans that very much want him to be the nominee.
*  Yes, from a message standpoint, she was really in a bind. Remember, she first started this as
*  pretty respectful of Trump. But she said, you know, it's time to turn the page. It's time for
*  a new generation of leadership. I'm the new face of the Republican Party. Then she started
*  being a little more critical of him on policy and talking about he ran up the debt by eight trillion
*  dollars. He's leaving behind our allies in Ukraine. That didn't work very well either. Then she
*  started sharpening her message about Trump personally. And by the end, she was talking about Donald
*  as an agent of chaos with a brain that seemed to be abdling. I mean, she was getting tougher
*  and that didn't work either. Right. Because the harder you go at Trump, the bigger the back lashes
*  against you. But if you don't go at Trump, people will say, well, why are we you even running?
*  I'll vote for the original guy. Right. And if you're an independent, why would I turn to you at all
*  if you're not willing to criticize Trump? And so, and so, Jonathan, what we have witnessed stepping
*  back over the past two nomination contests, Iowa, now New Hampshire, is that you can't beat Trump
*  by running as his political heir, which DeSantis tried didn't work. You can't beat Trump by running
*  as ultimately his nemesis or critic, which Nikki Haley just tried. You just can't beat him as a
*  Republican. Pretty much, period. Yes. This is Donald Trump's party. And that's why after tonight,
*  Donald Trump has this Republican nomination wrapped up.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Jonathan, with the caveat that Nikki Haley does remain in the Republican race for however long
*  she decides to stay in it, we are now effectively in the very strange position of a general election
*  that basically begins now 10 months before election day. Yeah. And you know, it's really crazy about
*  it is it feels to voters like these are two incumbent presidents. You have an incumbent president
*  in Joe Biden running against a former president who was only president, you know,
*  less than four years ago in Donald Trump. Right. And people are making a judgment based on,
*  you know, what kind of presidents they were. It feels like an incumbent on incumbent election already.
*  And we should say this is a general election that, improbably, pits not just two incumbents,
*  as you're describing, but the exact same two candidates who ran against each other four years ago,
*  one of whom sought to overturn the results of that last election 2020 and is now relying on that
*  same system to elevate him to become his party's nominee and then we'll seek to have that same
*  system elect him president. And that race, that last race where Biden faced Trump and its aftermath
*  was a complete national trauma. And yet our political system is recreating that same race.
*  Yeah. And remember after January 6th, the Republican party had their moment. They could have been
*  done with Donald Trump. At that time, the would be speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy went down
*  to the floor of the house to actually say, no, we are not going to support the impeachment of Donald
*  Trump. Then we had Mitch McConnell going to the well of the Senate. He had the opportunity to convict
*  Trump in that impeachment. And after the conviction, the Senate could have easily voted with just a
*  simple majority to bar Trump from ever holding federal office again. Instead, they acquitted him.
*  So here we are now. And the entire Republican apparatus is coalescing around him. They're
*  looking at the Republican electorate and saying, well, if you can't beat him, join him. We saw
*  Tim Scott right behind Trump and is victory speech. We saw John Cornyn, who might be the next
*  Senate majority leader from Texas endorsing Trump. We saw people like representative Nancy Mace
*  from South Carolina, who endorses Trump over Nikki Haley. And it's not because Nikki Haley is
*  alienated all these people. They don't hate her. They just see the handwriting on the wall. And they
*  fear crossing Donald Trump. They feel like now is the time they have to unite behind the
*  eventual nominee. Right. We should say on the other side of a 2024 ballot and contributing to
*  this rematch we're talking about is a democratic party apparatus and leadership that decided that
*  Joe Biden should be the nominee again. And they worked pretty tirelessly to ensure that there
*  would not be a robust fight over that question. And so we now end up with a democratic nominee
*  that has real questions around his popularity in a general election against Trump, who has real
*  questions about his popularity against Biden. It is a truism that incumbent presidents are very
*  difficult to defeat. They almost always win reelection. And it was kind of natural for the
*  democratic party apparatus, its leadership to rally around Joe Biden as the incumbent. But this
*  is a weak incumbent. You can look at any polling. You can see he's weak with young voters. He's
*  weak with progressive voters who right now are very angry at the war in Gaza. He is weak with
*  black voters who were really stung by inflation and feel like they didn't get all the things that
*  they were promised. And he's really weakened among Hispanic voters. He is looking like a weak
*  incumbent. And yet the party powers rallied around him. And now we have two candidates running for
*  president that are not particularly popular with the American people. Despite that though, I wonder
*  if there is a way of looking at tonight's results in New Hampshire just to go back to the main
*  event here as any kind of a positive development for president Biden. If once Nikki Haley does
*  eventually drop out of his race, does it feel correct or at all safe to assume that at least
*  some of her supporters, especially these independent voters might be comfortable voting for president
*  Biden in a general election. Many of them have told our colleagues that they couldn't stomach voting
*  for Trump. And this is for all kinds of reasons, right? For January 6th because of Trump's conduct,
*  because it was criminal liability and so on. And therefore what Nikki Haley did well in New Hampshire
*  boards pretty well for Biden in November and pretty poorly for Trump. Is that how we should think
*  about this? When I look at Nikki Haley's 44% of New Hampshire, I don't think that's great news for
*  Nikki Haley. I think it is really great news for Joe Biden. The fact is Iowa is not a swing state.
*  New Hampshire is a swing state. And I look at those Haley voters and see a lot of potential support
*  for Joe Biden. I mean, the fact is we talk to a whole lot of independent voters in New Hampshire who
*  said they're going to vote for Nikki Haley because they wanted to stop Donald Trump. But they
*  fully acknowledge they plan to vote for Joe Biden in the fall. I think that what we see in
*  those Haley voters in the exit polling is a real fear of another Trump term. And that fear
*  is going to show up in a movement toward Joe Biden. That being said, we don't know what all these
*  Haley voters are going to do in November. Some of them might fall in line with Donald Trump just
*  the way so many other people do. Some might just not go out and vote at all in November because
*  they don't like their choices and they don't have to make one of the choices.
*  Right. And to that point on this night where we feel like we can say that this Republican
*  nomination contest is basically over and that the general election has commenced. The reality is that
*  polling right now, national polling, swing state polling shows this to be an excruciatingly close
*  general election race. Yes, it's 10 months out, but the closeness of it is kind of extraordinary.
*  And those same polls tell us each and everyone that voters, especially those who
*  mandoping decisive in this election, are just not happy with their choices.
*  Most Americans did not want a rematch between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. And that's leading to
*  this real sense of dread, a fear of what is going to be coming over the next nine, 10 months.
*  And even a denial, you hear it all the time. Republicans saying, oh, Joe Biden isn't really
*  going to be the nominee. Somehow there's some magical thing that he's going to pull that the
*  Democrats are going to put up someone else. Or you talk to Democrats and they say, oh, there's no
*  way Donald Trump's not really going to be the nominee. Somehow maybe he'll be put in prison.
*  It could happen. Maybe he'll be knocked off the ballot by a constitutional intervention.
*  But the fact is underneath it all, everybody is really afraid about what is brewing for this
*  coming election. Right. What you're really saying is that there's some wishful thinking happening
*  right now on the part of both parties. And it's born out of this sense of denial that you are
*  diagnosing in the electorate. I mean, people are so determined to avoid this in their heads and
*  in their worlds that they're basically engaging in fantastical thinking. We don't know what's going to
*  be actually going on in this country by the time we actually vote for the next president. But
*  right now nobody wants this contest. And how both of these candidates navigate that dread and
*  perhaps propagate that dread could determine who is victorious on November 2nd.
*  Well, Jonathan, it is now Wednesday morning. Get some sleep. Thank you very much. We appreciate it.
*  Thank you for having me, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to another day. We found some loose balls on many of our max lines.
*  So those are things that are going to be rectified through the inspection process.
*  In an interview on Tuesday with NBC News, the CEO of Alaska Airlines disclosed that the company
*  has found loose bolts on the doors of multiple Boeing Max 9 jets in its fleet. It was a startling
*  revelation from an airline that experienced a blown outdoor on a Boeing Max 9 made flight earlier
*  this month. In the interview, Alaska CEO Ben Minikuchi publicly rebuked Boeing for the problem.
*  It makes me angry. Boeing is better than this and flight 12 to you should never have happened.
*  And the film Oppenheimer, the subject of yesterday's daily,
*  one 13 Oscar nominations on Tuesday, the most by far of any film released last year.
*  The movie, which tells the story of the race to build the atomic bomb, one nominations for best
*  director, best actor, and best cinematography among others, and is now the front runner for best picture.
*  Today's episode was produced by Asla Chautervati, Alex Stern and Michael Simon Johnson.
*  It was edited by Rachel Quester and MJ Davis Lin and was engineered by Alyssa Moxley
*  and contains original music from Mary and Luzano and Dan Powell.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Lansford of Wonderly.
*  That's it for the day of me. I'm Michael Borgon. See you tomorrow.
