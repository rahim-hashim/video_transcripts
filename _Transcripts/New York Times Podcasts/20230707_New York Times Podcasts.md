# The Complicated Future of Student Loans
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx7efliPjHY)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Ketroef, in for Michael Barbaro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Last Friday, the Supreme Court struck down President Biden's sweeping plan to cancel
*  billions of dollars in student loan debt.
*  Today, my colleague Stacey Cowley on what the court's decision means for borrowers
*  now facing their first payments since the pandemic and how an alternative plan
*  could still ease their burden.
*  It's Friday, July 7th.
*  Stacey, welcome back.
*  And Natalie, welcome back.
*  You're guest hosting again.
*  Yes. Imagine my surprise.
*  The last time I was guest hosting The Daily, there was big student loan news.
*  And now here I am back with you to talk about more student loan news.
*  It's a wonky but fun duo act we have going.
*  So last time you and I spoke about President Biden's plan to forgive billions
*  of dollars in student debt.
*  That was a plan that had generated a lot of controversy.
*  And now just last week, the Supreme Court struck it down.
*  Remind me how that issue got to the Supreme Court.
*  What was Biden trying to do?
*  So the problem the president was trying to tackle here was the issue of crippling
*  student loan debt.
*  Over the past roughly two decades, the cost of higher education has completely soared.
*  Student debt loads have roughly tripled in the past 20 years.
*  For many people, their student loan bill is the biggest monthly bill in their lives now.
*  More than 45 million people owe the federal government money for their student loans
*  and they owe a total of one point six trillion dollars.
*  That eclipses all other consumer debts other than mortgages.
*  For many people, it's bigger than their rent bill, bigger than their car payments,
*  bigger than their credit cards, bigger than any other bill that they're paying.
*  So back in March 2020, as a pandemic emergency measure, President Donald Trump
*  approved a timeout.
*  The idea was that people were under huge financial stress because of the pandemic.
*  Lots of people were losing their jobs.
*  And to give people more breathing room, they decided that this would be put on pause,
*  that no one would have to pay their federal student loan bills for some period of time.
*  What ended up happening is those pauses just kept being extended over and over again.
*  President Trump continued them throughout his entire administration.
*  As soon as President Biden took office on his very first day in office, he extended the
*  pause and that just kept going and going and going.
*  Meaning anyone who owed the government money for their education didn't have to make a
*  single payment on that debt during the pause.
*  Right. And for many people, this was an enormous change.
*  I mean, certainly for people who lost their jobs, this was a very helpful temporary measure
*  to tide them over. But also for people who did keep their jobs, this just changed their
*  household finances completely.
*  I was speaking recently with one borrower.
*  His name is Victor. He lives right outside the Denver area.
*  And he and his wife had been paying over a thousand dollars a month for their student
*  loans. Once that went away, they looked at each other and said, we can afford to use
*  that money to buy a house.
*  So in June 2020, they were able to buy their first home together.
*  But this time out was always intended to be temporary.
*  And the law Biden was using to do it in particular relied upon the education secretary
*  being able to do this in a time of national emergency.
*  It's pretty hard to make the case that the coronavirus is still a national emergency.
*  So this was going to have to as much as this temporary extension went on and on as long
*  as it did, it was going to at some point have to end.
*  And part of the problem the administration was facing, why they didn't want to just pick
*  back up exactly where we were before the pandemic, is this is a system that had been
*  pretty badly broken for years.
*  Lots of people had been falling into default.
*  A lot of people have been struggling with bills they could not afford to pay before
*  the pandemic. So the solution the Biden administration came to was to say, if we're
*  going to restart this, let's try to really fix it.
*  Let's do something big and dramatic.
*  My campaign for president, I made a commitment.
*  I made a commitment that would provide student debt relief.
*  And I'm honoring that commitment today.
*  And that big, dramatic thing was the debt cancellation plan we discussed last summer.
*  Right. Exactly.
*  With today's announcement, the government is forgiving $10,000 in federal loans for
*  anyone earning less than $125,000 a year.
*  And canceling up to $20,000 in student loans for those who receive Pell grants.
*  This is something that progressive activists in particular have been pushing for for many
*  years. This idea that pretty much everyone who had a federal student loan debt would
*  get some chunk of it written off and forgiven.
*  People can start finally crawl out from under that mountain of debt to get on top of their
*  rent and their utilities to finally think about buying a home or starting a family or
*  starting a business.
*  So what this plan did collectively was it targeted a lot of the relief to low income
*  families and to non-white borrowers.
*  So for borrowers of color in particular, this was going to be a pretty major financial
*  windfall. Right. I remember this was going to cost a lot of money.
*  Right. But it could potentially help a ton of people.
*  Yeah. The price tag on this was over $400 billion.
*  So it would have been one of the most expensive executive actions in American history.
*  But it would also have helped quite a few people.
*  The estimate was that up to 40 million people were going to be eligible for some level of
*  debt cancellation and that around 20 million would have seen their entire student loan
*  balance wiped out.
*  Wow. But there was also a real problem with this and that it quickly became a political
*  lightning rod. No one's paying off Arkansas Farmers Tractor loans.
*  No one's paying off their small business loans.
*  No one's paying off their mortgage.
*  Republicans had some real political pushback around the idea of why should people who have
*  paid off their loans subsidize those who haven't?
*  Is this just a big giveaway to this educated class of borrowers?
*  Senator Mitch McConnell calling it a slap in the face to every family who sacrificed to
*  save for college every graduate who paid their debt.
*  And also it became a big legal issue and that this was a $400 billion program.
*  And Biden was really swinging on this one in terms of the legal standing to do it.
*  So that's where the court challenges arose.
*  A group of Republican led states came together and sued to stop this.
*  And what was the argument behind that lawsuit?
*  The court challenged what Biden had done legally was that the law that Biden had used to
*  do this, an act called the Heroes Act, didn't give him this power.
*  That law gave the Secretary of Education the ability to waive or modify student loan
*  debt. The argument the states made was that doesn't translate to the ability to
*  unilaterally wipe out billions and billions of dollars worth of student loan debt.
*  The suit saying that Biden needed to consult Congress to do something this big.
*  The suit was directly saying that, that Congress controls the power of the purse, that if
*  you're going to cancel hundreds of billions of dollars in student loans, that needs to
*  be a decision Congress clearly makes, that the president does not have the sole
*  authority to do it.
*  Right.
*  So as this lawsuit made its way through the court system, Biden was forced to put the
*  entire student debt forgiveness program on hold.
*  Literally at the last second, as they're right about to start canceling debt for tens
*  of millions of people who have applied for this program, they hit pause, freeze the
*  program and wait for the court challenges to work their way through up to the Supreme
*  Court.
*  And so last Friday, we get a decision from the court.
*  Yes.
*  And the court sides with the states in this case.
*  The court majority says pretty clearly that they agree that the president does not have
*  the power under this law to do this.
*  And that if this level of debt cancellation is going to occur, it has to be a decision
*  made by Congress.
*  So basically, this is the Supreme Court saying that for now, mass student debt cancellation
*  is off the table.
*  Yes.
*  And also this was the Supreme Court saying this pretty definitively that this is not
*  something this president or any president is going to be able to do unilaterally.
*  I think this decision did very firmly kick this issue back to Congress and make it clear
*  that if anything of this scale is going to happen, it's going to have to be done by
*  Congress.
*  And the reason that hasn't happened is that Congress simply hasn't had the votes to
*  do it.
*  Even when Democrats controlled both chambers, the Senate didn't have the votes to pass
*  it. And certainly now that the Republicans control the House, there's really no prospect
*  in the near future of Congress taking this up.
*  So what was the reaction to the decision?
*  It was not entirely shocked, to be honest.
*  This is a conservative court and people were kind of braced for this decision.
*  But certainly it was a gut punch for a lot of people.
*  There are people who were really relying on this to get rid of a debt that had haunted
*  them in some cases for decades.
*  This is especially coming at a fraught time for people because in October, these payments
*  resume. So people are being told not only are you not going to get this cancellation,
*  but in just a couple of months, you're going to have to start sending in checks again.
*  So this moment feels like a pretty big setback for Biden.
*  I mean, eliminating student debt was one of his big campaign promises.
*  Right. And it's hugely popular with his base, especially younger people.
*  The Supreme Court blocks it right before people are going to have to start repaying the
*  debt. Yes.
*  I mean, this was a huge blow for Biden.
*  This had become one of his signature efforts.
*  This was something that was really important to tens of millions of people.
*  Let me begin by saying I know there are millions of Americans, millions of Americans in
*  this country who feel disappointed and discouraged or even a little bit angry about the
*  court's decision today on student debt.
*  So Biden gives a press conference at the White House on Friday, attacking this decision.
*  Republican elected officials and special interests stepped in.
*  They said no, no.
*  And really firmly pointed the finger back at the Supreme Court and the Republicans.
*  You know, these Republican officials just couldn't bear the thought of providing relief
*  for working class, middle class Americans.
*  He said over and over that this was the Republican Party choosing to try to block this.
*  I believe the court's decision to strike down my student debt relief program was a
*  mistake was wrong and that this was a Supreme Court doing what he thought was a
*  misinterpretation of the law.
*  But wasn't it always kind of a moonshot to try to cancel federal student loan debt?
*  I mean, I'm sure for people who have a bunch of debt, it sounds great, but it also just
*  seems like it might have been unlikely from the beginning.
*  Yes, this was always, as you said, a moonshot and kind of a gamble.
*  And there was always the chance that it was going to get blocked.
*  We need to find a new way.
*  And we're moving as fast as we can.
*  But the reality is that while this was pretty important, it was only one piece of a larger
*  plan for overhauling the student loan system.
*  Today's decision has closed one path.
*  Now we're going to pursue another.
*  And the other elements of that plan are still going ahead.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Stacey, before the break, you said there were these other elements of debt relief that
*  were on the way.
*  What are those?
*  So debt cancellation was the biggest and flashiest and simplest piece of President
*  Biden's plan.
*  But there's a whole bunch of other elements of this plan that are still prepared to move
*  forward that the Supreme Court hasn't touched.
*  And again, the biggest one there is going to affect for millions of people how much
*  they actually pay on their loans.
*  What Biden has been planning since late last year is a new payment plan for those who
*  are on income driven payments.
*  What's that? So there's several different ways you can pay your student loan bill.
*  The default plan is that you just pay it in chunks over the course of 10 years.
*  And if you can make that number, great.
*  But a lot of people can't afford that number.
*  So the government instead offers what's called income based repayment plans, where the
*  amount you owe each month is directly tied to your income.
*  Meaning monthly payments are a function of a borrower's income.
*  If you make less, you owe less.
*  If you make more, you owe more every month.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  And what the Biden administration has done here is designed a completely new income
*  driven plan that's very different than the ones we've seen before.
*  How so?
*  The biggest pieces of this is as two really dramatic things.
*  The first is that it would cap the amount that you owe for undergraduate loans at no
*  more than five percent of your income.
*  What your income is is calculated through a slightly complicated formula that exempts
*  a certain amount below the poverty line.
*  But basically, they're looking at what's called your discretionary income.
*  And under the existing payment plans, you owe up to 10 percent of that amount to pay
*  off your loans. This cuts it to five percent.
*  That right there means that millions of people are going to see their monthly student
*  loan bill cut in half.
*  That seems pretty significant.
*  Yes, it definitely is, especially when paired with the second change that's in this new
*  program, which is that interest will not accrue for people who are making their monthly
*  payments. That is an enormous change in how student loans operate.
*  What's been really frustrating for many people over the years is that these interest
*  payments can often eclipse what you're paying on your monthly bill.
*  Every penny you send in is being used to pay down interest and your debt actually isn't
*  decreasing. I talked to a gentleman named Claude Reed, who took out thirty three hundred
*  dollars in loans back in the early 70s.
*  He's been making payments since then.
*  He's paid over nine thousand dollars on his loans over the years.
*  But with interest in fees, the balance keeps going up.
*  So right now, he still owes forty six hundred dollars more than he borrowed originally.
*  And for many borrowers, that's an incredibly frustrating and common experience to feel
*  like they're throwing this money at payments every month and the number on their bill just
*  keeps rising. Right.
*  And what this plan says is for the first time, if you are sending in your payment each
*  month, that money is going to go straight towards decreasing your balance.
*  That's going to be a huge psychological change for people, because one of the biggest
*  barriers with student loans is this sense of I'm throwing money at this every month and
*  it keeps going up.
*  I'm not making any progress.
*  This will change that.
*  OK, so now for people like Claude Reed, what you're saying is that the amount they owe
*  every month is not going to get bigger as long as they stay current on their payments.
*  Yes. And there's one more thing here, which is that it's always been possible to qualify
*  for a zero dollar monthly payment.
*  If your income is very low, you can qualify to not have to make a monthly payment.
*  This new plan tinkers with the formula there a bit and expands the group of people who
*  are going to qualify for that.
*  That's going to have a big impact for people on the lowest end of the income spectrum.
*  Certainly anyone making minimum wage is going to qualify for this zero dollar monthly
*  payment. And this is intended both to help those borrowers and also to help the government
*  a bit. It wants these people to stop falling into default.
*  It wants these people to have an easier pathway to remain current on their loans.
*  So by expanding the group of people who are going to qualify for no payment because they
*  just don't have the income to really make any payments, that's intended to really be
*  a benefit for a growing number of people.
*  So just to recap, under the new plan, for many borrowers, their monthly payments will
*  be cut in half.
*  We're also going to see that overall debts won't get bigger with ballooning interests.
*  And then for more borrowers who are in a really tough situation, maybe they've lost their
*  job or they don't earn all that much money to start with, they will not have to make
*  monthly payments at all.
*  Yes, cumulatively, that's going to be a really big set of changes for the student loan
*  system. And this is all coming and being done quite deliberately at a fairly critical time
*  for the system, because October is when payments restart.
*  So for borrowers who for more than three years now have not had to be making their
*  payments, they're now going to have to start doing that again.
*  And this is all intended to be kind of a reset to make that transition easier.
*  There's a few other things happening there as well.
*  One of the big ones is that the administration said last week that for the first 12 months,
*  borrowers who are late on their payments or fall behind on them and don't make them won't
*  be reported to credit bureaus.
*  So they're trying to kind of cushion the transition and soften the blow and give people
*  time to get back to this idea of having this bill be part of their lives again.
*  And Stacey, given what happened to Biden's last big attempt to rein in student debt,
*  the last big, sweepy effort, how do we know that this part of the plan is actually going
*  to happen?
*  It's an excellent question.
*  On this one, the administration has said that they thought their authority to do this was
*  crystal clear and that they would be surprised if there was legal challenges.
*  And it is true that the law does give the Education Secretary the authority to design
*  these repayment plans.
*  The Education Secretary has been doing that for decades.
*  And this does seem to be on firmer ground as something that is a typical act that the
*  Education Department can go forth and do.
*  Stacey, as you're describing all these changes, it strikes me that they're a pretty big
*  deal, right?
*  But they don't have the emotional power of what we thought was going to happen, of getting
*  rid of $20,000 of debt for a borrower overnight.
*  And I guess I just I wonder if these changes, as impactful as they may be, will feel
*  transformative to people on an individual level.
*  Yes, I think that's exactly right.
*  The emotional element of this is going to be really challenging.
*  The reality is that this will be a very different student loan system than it was before
*  the pandemic. People's monthly bills are going to look very different.
*  In many cases, they're going to be smaller.
*  But we're also still going back to a world where after three years of having a zero dollar
*  student loan payment, people are going to have to start once again paying hundreds of
*  thousands of dollars a month on these debts.
*  And there's no way for that to happen without it feeling pretty unpleasant for people.
*  Right. And one of the upshots of the way this all played out was that people feel like
*  something got snatched away.
*  People were promised this big debt relief, which would have been a big, exciting, very
*  easy to understand thing.
*  And instead, that's gone.
*  And now we're left with going back into a more efficient, more affordable, but still
*  ultimately, it's a debt collection system.
*  So even though the world in October, as we re-enter these debt payments, is going to
*  be better for a lot of people, it's still not necessarily going to feel better.
*  For a lot of people, there's just going to be this heavy sense of, I once again have
*  to pick up and start paying this big, crushing debt.
*  Stacey, thank you so much.
*  Thanks, Natalie.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Thursday, Janet Yellen began a four day trip to China, her first to the country, and
*  as Treasury Secretary.
*  The visit will be a challenging act of economic diplomacy as Yellen attempts to ease years
*  of distrust between the U.S.
*  and China. Both countries have continued to erect new barriers to trade and investment,
*  particularly after the U.S.
*  began blocking China's access to sensitive technology such as semiconductors last year.
*  And for the first time in two decades, the federal government gave an Alzheimer's drug
*  full approval.
*  The drug, leukemba, has been shown to modestly slow cognitive decline in the early stages
*  of the disease.
*  And Medicare, the federal health insurance program for older Americans, said it would
*  cover much of its high cost, laying the foundation for the drug's widespread use.
*  Data from a large clinical trial showed that the drug may slow decline by about five
*  months over an 18 month period for people with mild symptoms, but that it also carries
*  significant safety risks.
