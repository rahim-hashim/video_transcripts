# The Afterlife of a Gun
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnbij_j9pYQ)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Ketroff. This is The Daily.
*  Across America, hundreds of towns and cities are trying to get guns off the streets by
*  turning them over to businesses that offer to destroy them. But a New York Times investigation
*  found that something very different is happening. Today, my colleague Mike McIntyre on the unintended
*  consequences of efforts by local officials to rid their communities of guns.
*  It's Tuesday, January 9th.
*  Mike, you cover guns in America where gun possession is a uniquely protected right,
*  which means that getting guns out of circulation is an uphill battle. And I understand you've
*  been looking into that. Tell me about your reporting.
*  Yeah, we've been looking a lot at the issues of gun violence, gun culture, gun commerce
*  in the United States because with more than 400 million firearms in the civilian population,
*  it continues to be a major issue of public debate. And a lot of that debate has centered
*  around the easy accessibility of guns, how simple it is to be able to purchase one, the
*  types of firepower involved, and the havoc that they can wreak. I mean, gun violence
*  actually surpassed car crashes recently in terms of the most common cause of deaths for
*  children and adolescents. More than half of the gun violence-related deaths are suicides.
*  So there's every reason to be looking at the scourge of gun violence, but there's also
*  this other side of it that doesn't get a lot of attention, which is what happens to guns
*  that nobody wants anymore? And so we started taking a look at what that process looks like
*  and discovered that it's actually not quite as simple as you might think.
*  Okay, just to back up a second, say more about what guns we're talking about here, these
*  unwanted guns that are up for disposal.
*  So police departments have a tendency to become almost like landfills or repositories for
*  firearms that come into their possession through any number of ways. Sometimes guns are confiscated
*  from crime scenes. You get people turning in guns that they don't want. Other times
*  it's the police agencies themselves that are trying to upgrade their service weapons. And
*  so they wind up with an inventory of old ones that they need something to do with. And especially
*  larger police departments, you very quickly, as you might imagine, end up with storage
*  lockers and evidence rooms just chock full of guns and related equipment. This is obviously
*  a liability problem. I mean, you get situations where guns have disappeared from police departments.
*  You get other cases in which guns are sold or auctioned off because they just need to
*  free up space and then it winds up being reused again in a crime, sometimes even against police.
*  So there's a whole lot of controversy about what happens to these guns. But that basically
*  is why the police are in the situation of having to figure out how to dispose of them
*  because they just simply wind up with more than they know what to do with.
*  Okay. So basically these are guns that are just hanging around and the police need to
*  do something with them. And more and more they're trying to destroy these guns and take
*  them out of circulation.
*  Right. But there is a sort of interesting subset that has increased in recent years.
*  And that is the population of guns that are turned into what they call buyback programs.
*  And these are programs in which governments or sometimes nonprofit organizations like
*  churches especially will offer incentives for people to turn in guns that they don't
*  want either through cash payments or sometimes grocery store gift cards, that sort of thing.
*  There's not a lot of research that suggests that they do much to reduce crime, which has
*  led to some criticism of these by gun rights advocates. However, there's also sort of a
*  logic to why they might want to be done in the sense that if nothing else, they would
*  remove guns from unstable situations, households in which there's a concern that a gun being
*  present might contribute to a tragic event like a suicide or a domestic violence incident
*  or a child getting a hold of it and hurting his or herself or someone else.
*  So buybacks have become increasingly popular and they are making up more and more of the
*  firearms that police wind up having to dispose of.
*  Okay, so Mike, how have they been destroying all these guns, both the police surplus ones
*  and the guns from the buyback programs?
*  So traditionally, the way that guns are disposed of has been very limited means that there's
*  a surprisingly small number of approved methods that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,
*  which is the regulatory agency overseeing guns in the United States, says are acceptable.
*  In the past, they really boiled down to one of two ways. One was to put it through a smelter
*  at a steel mill and literally melt it down.
*  Wow.
*  Another was to use a blowtorch to make a series of cuts in the firearm to make sure that it's
*  rendered inoperable and basically reduce it to three or four pieces. And other methods
*  that have been used in the past would be simply trying to smash it with a sledgehammer.
*  That's all kind of medieval.
*  Yeah, you're right. I mean, the problem, as you might guess, is that first of all, some
*  of these are dangerous. And secondly, they're not guaranteed to work completely. And then
*  thirdly, they can be expensive. If you're going to use a torch to do a whole lot of
*  guns, you're probably going to have to pay a gunsmith or someone like that to do it.
*  So police departments literally take those guns to a smelter or someone who just smashes
*  it to smithereens.
*  Yes. I mean, that's traditionally the way it's been done in the past. But about a decade
*  ago, there was a new process introduced that began to change things a little bit.
*  Interestingly, it was introduced by a former police officer himself. There was a fellow
*  named Ray Reynolds from the St. Louis Police Department who had retired in the late 1980s
*  and gone to work for a couple of gun companies. And he then started his own business of helping
*  police departments trade in their unwanted or old service weapons to use as credit to
*  purchase new ones. And somewhere along the line, he saw an opening in the whole area
*  of how to dispose of guns.
*  New at six, Pulverizing Pistols. A local company is helping collect and destroy unwanted guns.
*  And Reynolds created this company called Gunbusters.
*  Tonight, an up close look at this metal mashing machine.
*  Which developed a machine called the Firearms Pulverizer. He had it patented in 2014 and
*  they put video cameras inside it. And so you could actually videotape the destruction process
*  and see it happening. And so his idea was to take this and use that machine to destroy
*  the gun quickly and easily. This was his innovation. That it was a way for police departments to
*  avoid having to deal with steel mills, avoid having to deal with blow torches and sledge
*  hammers and provide them with a quick way to kind of solve this problem.
*  And did you find in your reporting, Mike, that this was actually a more efficient way
*  of getting rid of guns than say smashing them with a sledgehammer?
*  So we visited the Gunbusters facility, which is located outside St. Louis. And we got a
*  tour of the place from the president of the company, Scott Reed, who was the son-in-law
*  of the founder.
*  So we are licensed by ATA the same way any gun store would be.
*  One of the striking things when we first go in there is they have rows and rows of walk-in
*  vaults filled with guns that they've been collecting from police agencies all over the
*  country which have to be destroyed. So you get a sense of the full scale of it. You're
*  talking thousands of weapons.
*  Wow.
*  Do we get any chance to take a look at how this rig works?
*  So this is our pulverizer. So there's two ways to look at it. It's either a scaled-up
*  paper shredder or it's a scaled-down car shredder.
*  And he showed us how the whole process works. And I have to say it really is quite efficient.
*  So it steps back to recording. Set it down. Drop it in.
*  You can see from the camera inside the process as it happens. The gun goes in one end, gets
*  crunched up.
*  So you see, you get little pieces. And then comes out the other end as pieces. And then
*  there's a computer program that basically records the time and date and the witness
*  who was there. And all of that is sent to the police. And the best thing about this
*  process for law enforcement agencies is it's completely free.
*  It's free?
*  It's free. It costs them nothing. And that is the big selling point and probably the
*  main innovation of gun busters. Now, there's a reason for how they can do that. And this
*  is sort of the rub in the whole story is that they dismantle the firearm before it's put
*  through the machine. And only one component is usually put through the pulverizer and
*  crushed. All the rest of the parts of the gun are then sold online for anybody to purchase.
*  So you're telling me that this company that advertises itself as a pulverizer of guns
*  is actually salvaging parts of them and then selling them off, basically fueling a secondary
*  market for guns.
*  That's exactly correct. And the way they do it has a lot to do with how guns are regulated
*  in the United States. They dismantle each firearm that they collect from police agencies.
*  And in doing that, they remove the single piece of the gun that under the law and regulation
*  is considered to be a firearm. And that is called a receiver or the frame. And what this
*  component is, is really the central core of the gun to which all the other pieces are
*  connected. So you've got the barrel, the stock, the trigger, slide, whatever, which all depend
*  on having this one central piece in order to make it a working firearm. Now, it gets
*  a little complicated, but under the Gun Control Act of 1968, the receiver or the frame by
*  itself is considered to be a firearm.
*  So if you are a gun busters and you're telling the police that we're going to destroy the
*  firearm, which is what they want, then you can get away with just simply destroying that
*  one piece and say that you've destroyed the firearm. This is not known by a lot of average
*  people, but it is known to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. They don't have a problem
*  with that. They told us that the interpretation of the law is accurate and that is an acceptable
*  way of destroying a gun.
*  Now, once you destroy that one piece, you are left with a whole bunch of pieces that
*  could be put back together again, but they would still need that one missing piece in
*  order to make a working gun. And that is basically how gun busters and other companies like it,
*  or a handful of others that do this, make their money. They take those pieces and they
*  sell them as kits, which means that you can buy one without having a background check.
*  You don't have to go through a licensed dealer to purchase one of these because it's not
*  a functioning gun. But you can make it a functioning gun. You can then go and obtain a receiver
*  or frame someplace else, put it together with one of these kits, and then you've got a reconstituted
*  firearm.
*  Now, if the client wants to pay for it, gun busters will be happy to destroy the whole
*  gun, but the police agency would have to give them money to do that.
*  But is that what is actually happening? That these parts are in fact being repurposed into
*  new guns?
*  It's a little bit difficult to know exactly how often that happens and what the parts
*  kits are used for. Certainly there are people who are gun collectors or enthusiasts who
*  might be looking for a piece, especially of an old gun that's no longer available and
*  they want to be able to maintain or fix a firearm. But that wouldn't account for the
*  frequency with which these kits are sold. And if you go, for instance, on the website
*  called GunBroker, which is the world's largest online site for buying and selling firearms,
*  that is where most of gun busters kits are sold. You will find other sellers saying in
*  their listing, oh, you can pair this with a kit from gun busters and make a complete
*  working gun.
*  So we know that people certainly are buying these kits with that in mind. And we know
*  that most of the guns that gun busters takes in from police agencies do wind up being sold
*  in this way. So is there a reason to believe that a large portion of these kits are being
*  purchased for the exact purpose of being able to put them back together again and make a
*  working gun?
*  But it sounds like we don't have any way of knowing exactly what happens to any given
*  kit, to any given set of gun parts.
*  Part of the problem with trying to figure out what exactly happens to these gun kits
*  that are sold online by gun busters is they don't include the serial number because that
*  one component of the gun that they actually did destroy is the one component that has
*  a serial number. So the remaining parts most of the time do not have any kind of a way
*  of tracing them. And one of the concerns from gun violence groups is that there are people
*  out there who are capable of making their own receivers and frames which are not serialized.
*  These are commonly referred to as ghost guns because they are not traceable. And you would
*  have a working gun with no way of knowing where any of the components came from.
*  Okay, so all of this is pretty shocking. I mean, I assume the people who wanted a gun
*  eliminated because they felt like it posed a specific threat would be pretty surprised
*  that that gun was just repurposed. It feels like a bait and switch and also potentially
*  a total boon for this company.
*  Well, it certainly has been a boon for the company and others like it. Gun Busters says
*  that they've taken in more than 200,000 firearms over the past decade from about 950 police
*  agencies across the country, their biggest client being the Michigan State Police. So
*  when you figure the amount of money they've been making and selling these parts kits,
*  they've made millions of dollars. So it's certainly been lucrative for these businesses.
*  When you take into account the total number of guns in America, it may not seem like a
*  big number we're talking about. But you know, if you consider the havoc that one firearm
*  is capable of wreaking or if someone simply wants to make sure a gun is taken out of circulation,
*  you know, they may now be surprised by this to find out that they feel like they've been
*  led astray and not knowing what was actually happening to these guns. But the reality is
*  actually a lot more complicated. And if you take a closer look at how this came to be,
*  in many ways, it was totally predictable.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Mike, before the break, you explained to us that Gun Busters, a private company,
*  is taking unwanted guns across the country and is generally understood to be destroying them,
*  but is actually only destroying part of that gun and selling the rest for profit. But you also
*  said that while surprising, it's also totally predictable. Explain that.
*  When you look at the actual agreements that Gun Busters entered into with
*  law enforcement agencies, they make pretty clear in the text of these contracts that Gun Busters
*  intends to do exactly what it does. If an example, the sheriff's office in Denton County, Texas has
*  an agreement in which it says that no money will be exchanged or reimbursed as a result of the
*  destruction of the firearms, meaning that the sheriff's office doesn't have to pay anybody.
*  But then farther down, it also says that Gun Busters will sell salvaged parts and scrap metal.
*  Now, scrap metal is understandable because when you put the gun through the pulverizer,
*  what comes out the other end are just shredded pieces of metal. And they do make a little bit
*  of money by selling that. But salvaged parts is something completely different. And that refers to
*  the gun kits. That is really where the most of the money comes from. So this is not a huge mystery
*  to the police departments that are entering into these agreements with Gun Busters.
*  So the city officials and police departments contracting with Gun Busters do know that the
*  guns aren't actually being destroyed. I mean, are they reading the contract and fully aware
*  that this is the deal? Well, so that's a good question. From my review of a lot of city council,
*  town council, local board authorizations of these contracts, what you often see is what you might
*  expect is that they're sometimes approving a whole slate of contracts all at once. It's often
*  done on a very quick up and down vote. There's no reading of the contract. There's no questions
*  asked. So the police and the sheriff's office, they know what's in these contracts. But they also know
*  that if they were to pay for this, it would require going to the local elected officials and asking
*  for money. I mean, asking for a line item in their budget. And that's not something that most of these
*  police departments want to do or have to get involved in. And the elected officials often have
*  just no idea what's in these contracts. All they know is that they've entered into some sort of
*  an agreement to destroy the guns. Because that's how it's described. The guns are going to be
*  destroyed. And to a lay person, that's not a very complicated thought. But the details are where the
*  devil is. And most of the elected officials that I came across have no idea that's actually what's
*  happening. Okay, then. Gunbusters isn't lying to anybody. They technically in the contract are
*  saying exactly what they're offering. And police departments and other groups contracting with them
*  are maybe just willfully ignoring the fine print for the reasons you just described. But on the
*  other hand, the entire point of these programs is destroying guns. How does this meet that goal in
*  any way? So this is where the law and regulations around firearms becomes important. Because if
*  you remember, I mentioned the Gun Control Act, which was a law passed in 1968, where they defined
*  firearms in that particular way. When that law was passed, and the regulations were drafted to
*  enact it, it was not the intention at the time to create this sort of loophole that's now being
*  exploited, if you will. The intention in delineating what a receiver or frame was,
*  was to actually to make the regulations a little bit tighter. It was not meant to create that
*  loophole at all. Mike, it sounds like in this kind of twisted way, this law that was supposed to be
*  restrictive, is now actually perversely making it harder to get rid of guns. Yes. I mean, I think
*  that the intent of the regulations that were created after the 1968 act never foresaw the
*  situation where it would somehow allow for guns that were intended to be destroyed to instead be
*  essentially recycled in some fashion back out into the civilian market. And yet in this one way,
*  it has had the opposite effect. But it seems like the obvious solution here would be to change the
*  legal definition of a gun. I mean, right? Or at least for these governments to just pay the fee
*  to destroy the entire gun, which you said earlier, gun busters would do. Well, certainly if the police
*  agencies and the towns that support them would be willing to pay to have gun busters destroy the
*  complete firearm, that would be the simplest solution. But Scott Reed, when I visited gun
*  busters, told me that some 98% of their clients opt not to do that. The other option would be to
*  try to somehow change the regulations around what defines a receiver or frame. And that seems very
*  unlikely. I mean, first of all, you would have to either change the law or the ATF interpretation
*  of the law and the regulations. And neither of those things seem likely to happen in the current
*  climate. So even though this is clearly a loophole that was not meant to cause the effect that it is
*  having, now that it exists, it's hard to roll back, especially in the context of the super political
*  nature of everything related to guns. Yes. I mean, it was a given at one time that police departments
*  that wanted to get rid of guns could easily do so. And now you've got situations in which there are
*  actually some states where mostly Republican legislatures are passing laws that actually
*  prevent police departments from destroying guns in their inventory. And so instead, what they're
*  forced to do is to auction them off or sell them. So this is where you see this great divide happening,
*  where you've got mostly red states and communities that are making it more difficult for police to
*  get rid of guns. And you've got mostly blue cities and states where the opposite is happening.
*  Mike, I'm curious how Scott Reed, the man who runs Gunbusters, how do you think he feels about
*  all of this? I mean, he must know that some people are under the impression that he really is taking
*  guns out of circulation when we know he's not. I talked to him about this a couple of times.
*  Do you guys have like a philosophy of around this? I mean, what is your...
*  And he acknowledges that there are people that he deals with who do want the full gun to be destroyed.
*  And from his point of view, if they're willing to pay to do that, then he will do that.
*  I think at some point, you know, both sides see things in us that, you know, we can take as a
*  positive and both sides see things that can take us a negative. I don't know that we're actively
*  convincing anyone, hey, you should destroy your guns. You know, these are...
*  At the end of the day, though, he's a businessman. He's in the business of making money
*  and providing a service to law enforcement agencies. So, you know, I think we walk that
*  tightrope of how are we, you know, a public service where we're helping apartments. We are taking guns
*  out, you know, of the system. But then, you know, parts are still, you know, remain out there. So...
*  He can say that even the method that they do follow of taking the gun apart and selling the
*  pieces, you know, it is succeeding in taking guns out of the community in which the police department
*  had them. And so, you know, if a police agency somewhere has a bunch of guns from a buyback
*  and they want to get them out of the community and off the street, giving them to gunbusters
*  at least does that. But, you know, of course, if they don't pay to have the thing completely
*  destroyed, then the parts of those guns will find their way back out somewhere. It just may not be
*  in that particular community. Right. On the one hand, you could see gunbusters as exploiting the
*  vagaries in the law and the desire to get guns off the street to make money. But on the other
*  hand, gunbusters is being pretty straightforward in what they're doing. They see a market and they're
*  not being untruthful about the service they're providing. I mean, maybe people should just read
*  the fine print. So, how do you think about this, Mike? It really struck me going into this that
*  as easy as it is to obtain a gun in America these days, it's surprisingly difficult to get rid of
*  one. And the fact that we're engaged in this semantic debate about what isn't a firearm and
*  what's not a firearm, it just goes to how polarized everything is on this whole subject. And so,
*  the real reason why it's so difficult to destroy a gun has little to do with the means in which
*  you would physically do it. It has more to do with what it means to have a firearm and the ability to
*  regulate them is really what it boils down to. And even when there are genuine efforts to
*  destroy guns, it doesn't happen. I mean, there are enough forces against it. There's enough of
*  a market there that it fails. That is one of the great ironies is that at the end of the day,
*  even the best intentions when it comes to how to destroy a gun are often thwarted.
*  And the people who think they're doing some service to their community by taking
*  guns off the street, they are led to believe, often by their elected leaders who aren't paying
*  attention, that this in fact is what's happening. And it turns out that it's not.
*  Mike, thank you.
*  Well, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Following the Times investigation, Michigan State Police, which sends gunbusters about
*  11,000 guns a year and is its largest client, has temporarily paused its contract with the company.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group,
*  said on Monday that one of its commanders had been killed in a strike in southern Lebanon,
*  near the country's border with Israel. Israel and Hezbollah have traded increasingly intense
*  cross-border fire since Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza began three months ago. The latest attack,
*  which follows an Israeli strike last week that killed senior Hamas leaders in Lebanon,
*  has added to fears that the war in Gaza could erupt into a wider regional conflict.
*  And in an interview with the Times, the chief spokesman for the Israeli military said that
*  Israel is expected to begin to shift away from a large-scale ground and air campaign in Gaza
*  to a more targeted phase in its war against Hamas, involving fewer troops and airstrikes.
*  The disclosure comes as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visits leaders in the Middle East
*  this week on a trip aimed at preventing the fighting from expanding.
