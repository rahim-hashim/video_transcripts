*  Hi, my name is John Branch and I've been a reporter at the New York Times since 2005.
*  I grew up in Colorado, skiing and hiking in the mountains, but the people I write about
*  are often doing things that I would never or could never do myself.
*  I think I live vicariously through them and I find that readers sometimes do too.
*  This story that you're about to hear began for me in 2020 right before COVID.
*  I got a note from somebody I didn't know.
*  A journalist and mountain guide in Argentina named Pablo Bettincourt.
*  He said that he had a story that might interest me.
*  So we started talking and he told me that some porters had found an old camera on a massive
*  melting glacier atop Akinkagua.
*  It's a mountain in the Andes, the tallest in the world outside of Asia.
*  And the camera had undeveloped film in it.
*  And Pablo told me something else.
*  He said that the camera had a label on it and a name.
*  Janet Johnson.
*  In 1973, eight Americans set out to summit Akinkagua.
*  It was an interesting expedition for a couple of reasons.
*  One, because it happened to include a NASA engineer, a man in the control room for the Apollo
*  missions.
*  But also, there was a woman in the crew, which was rare for the time.
*  That woman was Janet Johnson.
*  She was probably the most experienced climber of all of them.
*  Most of the Americans were weekend climbers.
*  Akinkagua would be the biggest toughest mountain any of them had climbed.
*  Back then, not a lot of people had climbed Akinkagua.
*  It was hard to get to.
*  There were no real established base camps like there is today with Wi-Fi and hot showers.
*  So these eight Americans started up towards the summit.
*  Things quickly went awry.
*  Some in the party began to fall victim to the life-threatening effects of high altitude.
*  And soon, half of the expedition had returned to base camp.
*  But four Americans remained, including Janet Johnson.
*  They continued climbing toward the summit.
*  What happened next has been the subject of debate ever since.
*  But this we know.
*  Four people went up.
*  Two people came down.
*  Janet and the NASA engineer did not return.
*  The two survivors returned to base camp and told the others what had happened.
*  They used a ricochet around the world and back to the families in the United States.
*  Then the Americans went home.
*  And in their wake, they left a lot of unanswered questions behind.
*  In the States, the narrative seemed simple.
*  This was a tragic mountain accident in which two people died.
*  But in Argentina, the story of the eight Americans who attempted to summit Akinkagua
*  never really faded away.
*  Rather, the mystery grew.
*  The American expedition became a ghost story.
*  In the void of any official explanation, people devised their own theories about what happened.
*  Was it a love triangle gone bad?
*  Maybe the CIA was involved.
*  And wasn't there a bag of money that was never found?
*  But beyond these outlandish conspiracies, there were serious questions being asked by very
*  reasonable people who believed something strange did happen.
*  That maybe foul play had occurred.
*  That's where things stood for decades, basically until I got that message from Pablo
*  Betancourt.
*  We would look at the camera and try to develop the film inside.
*  We had no idea if it was salvageable after all this time.
*  And even if we could develop the images, would we get any answers to all the questions surrounding
*  the deadly expedition 50 years ago?
*  So I flew to Argentina twice and interviewed anyone who is still alive who might know
*  something, hoping that they might give me clues.
*  Back in the United States, we tracked down the families of the American climbers who are
*  now all dead to see what they knew.
*  It was all part of a mission that led to this story.
*  Who was Janet Johnson?
*  And what really happened to her?
*  So here's my article, and this week's Sunday read from The New York Times, Ghosts on the
*  Glacier.
*  Our audio is produced by Jack Dissedoro.
*  The interviews you'll hear were produced by Emily Reine and Noah Thrupe, and the original
*  music was written and performed by Aaron Esposito.
*  High on Aconcagua, the western hemisphere's highest mountain, the shrinking Polish glacier
*  spits out what once devoured.
*  In this case, a 50-year-old Niko mat 35-millimeter camera.
*  Two porters, preparing for an upcoming expedition, had been securing ropes in the thin and arid
*  air of a clear February day.
*  It was mid-summer in South America.
*  The camera glistened in the sun, daring to be noticed.
*  The lens was shattered.
*  A dial on top showed that 24 photographs had been taken.
*  The bottom half of the camera was saddled into a worn leather holster with a thick strap.
*  On the holster, in blue embossing tape, was an American name and a Colorado address.
*  In the snow and ice seasonal cycles of the mountains, abandoned and lost equipment is discovered
*  each summer.
*  Tattered tents, dropped ice axes, lost mittens.
*  Occasionally a body.
*  This was not just another camera, though the porters did not know that yet.
*  One of them carried it down to camp.
*  There, a veteran guide named Ulyssi's Corvalon was cooking lunch.
*  Corvalon glanced up.
*  He casually asked about the name on the bottom of the camera.
*  Janet Johnson came to reply.
*  Corvalon gasped and swore.
*  Janet Johnson, he shouted.
*  Excitement boiled instantly.
*  Do you know about Janet Johnson, the school teacher, about John Cooper, the NASA engineer,
*  about the deadly 1973 American expedition?
*  Have you heard the legend?
*  It had been handed down for decades, veering toward myth, whispered like a ghost story.
*  Here's what was certain.
*  A woman from Denver, maybe the most accomplished climber in the group, had last been seen
*  alive on the glacier.
*  A man from Texas, part of the recent Apollo missions to the moon, lay frozen nearby.
*  There were contradictory statements from survivors and a hasty departure.
*  There was a judge who demanded an investigation into possible foul play.
*  There were three years of summit scratching searches to find and retrieve the bodies.
*  Their discovery stirred more intrigue, leaving more questions than answers.
*  That's the imbalance of all the best mysteries.
*  Facts that don't quite add up.
*  Gaps that imagination rushed to fill.
*  That is how Janet Johnson and John Cooper became part of the folklore of Aachenkogwa.
*  And now, nearly five decades later, an old camera had emerged from the receding glacier.
*  It was wound, prepared to take the next picture.
*  More clues emerged from the ice.
*  Here was that left arm, still wearing a delicate silver, redo watch with a broken blue face.
*  There was a tattered pack and scattered belongings.
*  Down mittens, a red jacket, a single cramp on, a canister of used Kodak film.
*  Like that, by the whims of climate change and chance, a long-lost legend was given air
*  and light.
*  Aachenkogwa is the broad shoulder behemoth of the Andes, shaped more like a fist than
*  a finger.
*  It is brown and rocky, scrubby and dusty, dry and windwept.
*  With few trees or wildflowers, it can feel like a vertical desert.
*  The first person known to reach the 22,838-foot summit was Matthias Zerbergen of Switzerland
*  in 1897.
*  In 1934, a Polish expedition successfully tackled a perilous route on the north-eastern
*  side of Aachenkogwa, a massive glacier that stretches nearly 2,000 vertical feet towards
*  the summit.
*  The ice sheet was named for that group, Glossiar de los Palacos, the Polish glacier.
*  These days, Aachenkogwa is part of a vast state park with helpful rangers and a helicopter
*  rescue service.
*  Two base camps provide hot meals, showers and internet.
*  Some consider Aachenkogwa among the easiest to climb of the seven summits, the prestigious
*  name given the highest mountains on each continent.
*  But Aachenkogwa is not easy, trouble lurks in the thin air.
*  Through 2022, there were 153 known deaths on the mountain.
*  In 1973, Johnson and Cooper were numbers 26 and 27.
*  Back then, Aachenkogwa had only the most rudimentary of services.
*  Climbers had no GPS trackers, no way to communicate between base camp and the summit.
*  The Americans carried binoculars and a flare gun.
*  The mountain was virtually deserted.
*  If trouble came, there was nobody to help but the other members of the expedition.
*  Most of them were part of the Mazamas climbing club, founded in Oregon in 1894.
*  Their leader was a Portland lawyer named Carmine DeFoe, known as Karmie.
*  DeFoe, 52, pushed for the Aachenkogwa trip, noting that a Mazamas member had climbed it
*  in the 1940s.
*  His group, DeFoe, announced would attempt to be the fifth expedition to top Aachenkogwa
*  via the Polish route.
*  Difficulties are said to be moderate, a couple of places where we'll want handlines, not
*  any more difficult than the normal route of Mount McKinley.
*  DeFoe wrote in a 1972 memo, the guide would be Miguel Alfonzo, a 38-year-old Argentine
*  who had been to the summit five times once up the Polish route.
*  DeFoe asked for a $50 deposit from anyone interested, along with a list of successful
*  ascents and references.
*  In June 1972, DeFoe announced a members of the party, all American men whom he briefly
*  described.
*  William Petroski, a psychiatrist from Portland, Oregon, would be the deputy leader, he said.
*  Bill Ubank, a physician from Kansas City, Missouri, was highly recommended by Petroski and
*  would be the expedition doctor.
*  Then came Arnold McMillan, a dairy farmer from Otis, Oregon, and Bill Zeller, a police officer
*  in Salem, Oregon.
*  Bill and I shared a blizzard in the Canadian Rockies in 1969, a solid citizen, DeFoe wrote.
*  John Shelton, 25, was a bring-em-young geology student fluent in Spanish from a two-year
*  Mormon mission.
*  Been through Latin American customs about 25 times, which must take more energy than climbing
*  to Achenkogwa, DeFoe wrote.
*  And John Cooper, a NASA engineer from Houston, was, quote, highly recommended.
*  They were weakened climbers mostly, none had been above 20,000 feet.
*  DeFoe organized hikes in the Northwest, designed as training and get to know you exercises.
*  I have some trepidation about the party, because of a fear that we might have someone who
*  has unknown problems, or who is some kind of a think, DeFoe wrote in a memo to the group.
*  It turned out, however, that I either know everyone in the group, or they are people
*  I have been able to find out about.
*  This leaves me with no reservation or qualification about the party.
*  In November, DeFoe said reminders about packing lists, passports, vaccinations.
*  John is probably already rounding in the top physical condition he had.
*  Don't take any chances on this.
*  Work hard at it, especially with lots of jogging.
*  He also announced the final member of the eight-person American crew, a woman from Denver, named
*  Janet Johnson.
*  She was born on November 30, 1936, and soon was adopted by Victor and May Johnson, who lived
*  in a stone and timber tutor on the south side of Minneapolis.
*  He helped around his family's paper supply company.
*  She was a bookkeeper.
*  The Johnson's believed in manners, rules, and God.
*  Janet, with a tidy bedroom upstairs, was a quiet girl and a voracious reader.
*  She needed glasses early.
*  She played an organ at St. John's Lutheran Church.
*  When she was 10, she wanted a baby sister, so the Johnson's adopted a five-year-old girl
*  named Judy.
*  The new sister is met at the neighborhood park.
*  Janet took Judy home and gave her a doll named Lois.
*  Janet never married or had children.
*  Judy Abrahamson, now an 83-year-old widow in Oregon City, Oregon, is the only close relative
*  alive.
*  I'm Judy Abramsson and I'm her sister.
*  Janet was very tall, very straight-shouldered, blonde, dressed in eggs.
*  Very studious.
*  Straight-aids, if she wouldn't settle for nothing glass.
*  And just like she got her masters in music, she got her masters in teaching.
*  And I'm sure she could have gotten another one she would have.
*  If they had them for mountain climbing, she would have had it.
*  And then of course, when they found out she was gay, that's a whole different story.
*  It was when her sister was a way at college that Abrahamson discovered notes hidden in
*  a jewelry box.
*  Love notes between her sister and another young woman.
*  I've seen a snoopy little sister that I was.
*  I read them and I happened to mention something to my mother.
*  But my mother thought she's sick.
*  She's got to go in the hospital.
*  So because she was gay, my mother thought she could get healed.
*  It's said her to the hospital or in St. Paul.
*  And it didn't heal her.
*  But that was a big wrap between Janet and my mother.
*  It chased Janet away from home.
*  She settled in Denver, renting part of a two-story home on York Street near the Botanic
*  Gardens where she volunteered.
*  She got her teaching certificate that a master's degree, eventually a PhD in education at the
*  University of Colorado.
*  She taught in elementary schools and then became a school librarian, figuring it would
*  be easier to keep her nights and weekends free for the mountains.
*  Johnson joined the Colorado Mountain Club.
*  By 30, she became the 82nd known person and among the first 20 women to reach the summit
*  of each of Colorado's 14ers, the more than 50 peaks higher than 14,000 feet in elevation.
*  Her name was regularly in the Clubs magazine, Trail in Timberline, detailing various excursions.
*  Her photos grace the magazine's cover.
*  The companionship on the outing was tremendous.
*  That is, except for the wood ticks, which somehow managed to find their way into Maya
*  Bode on top of the hill.
*  She wrote in a 1961 report about a weekend trip in the Rockies.
*  Strangely enough, few other people even found one tick.
*  Why they picked on me, I don't know.
*  They say everyone was put here for a purpose, so maybe I was meant to sustain the ticks.
*  More and more, she headed overseas.
*  She was one of 38 members of a 1963 Club expedition in Peru.
*  On the way home, she climbed Istoxiwaddle, which rises more than 17,000 feet near Mexico
*  city.
*  It is unclear how many of the world's summits she reached.
*  She climbed Kilimanjaro and hoped to climb Denali after returning from Aakinkagua.
*  Most summers, she tied a kayak atop her Nash Rambler and headed to the northwest.
*  She would stay with her sister, hike Mount Hood and paddle in Puget Sound.
*  Abrahamson's children knew her as Aunt Janet, the free spirit.
*  In 1971, the graduation announcements for her PhD sent out by her mother, included a
*  formal portrait of Johnson, smiling with her cat eye glasses on.
*  She wanted to reach the highest levels of education.
*  She wanted to reach the summit of mountains.
*  I think Janet was trying to prove to herself and her mother that she could do anything
*  she wanted to, even as a gay person.
*  She was free when she was up there and felt at peace with herself.
*  She loved the mountain.
*  That was her life.
*  If Johnson had a significant other, Abrahamson never knew of her.
*  Boxes of slides that she left behind show mostly landscapes, not people.
*  She took the 1972-73 school year off.
*  That fall after a hiking trip in Europe, she joined the upcoming Mazamas expedition to
*  Aakinkagua.
*  Climbed all 67 of the 14,000 foot peaks in the United States, except Alaska, Kilimanjaro,
*  Orizaba, Popacada Pedal, Istoxiwaddle, Fugi, Mount Blunk, Matterhorn, Iger, Peru, etc.,
*  etc., Defoe Road of Johnson.
*  Recommended by two of my climbing friends from Denver.
*  She was happy to be going on this one because she had been selected.
*  She had told me that she got new climbing clothes and she was all set to go.
*  I probably won't ever see you again.
*  I said, well, I hope I'll see you again and she said, don't plan on it.
*  This is my last trip.
*  That was.
*  You did not come in.
*  She packed her belongings into an aluminum frame backpack, boots, flannel shirts, a red
*  down jacket, thick mittens, glacier glasses, a sleeping bag.
*  She used a marker to write her name or initials on most of them.
*  She wore a dainty silver rato watch and a ring with a brown stone that she got on a trip
*  to New Mexico.
*  And she brought the Niko mat, the consumer version of Nikon's professional cameras of
*  the era.
*  She probably bought the camera during her trip to Japan a couple of years earlier.
*  She used a label maker to punch her name and address on the blue embossing tape and stuck
*  it on the bottom of the leather camera case, just in case she lost it.
*  She carried the camera with her, the Aachen Kogwa, taking photographs long the way, almost
*  to the top.
*  American newspapers sent them off and Argentine newspapers greeted them at the Nuttavara
*  Hotel in Mendoza's city center.
*  Rafael Moran, a reporter for Los Andes, a daily newspaper in Mendoza, interviewed the
*  mountaineers near the pool.
*  He did not cover every Aachen Kogwa expedition, but this one was especially intriguing.
*  Americans, the Polish glacier, a woman, a NASA scientist.
*  Moran had a dark inkling about the group.
*  The Americans seemed disconnected from one another and unprepared for the serious task
*  of climbing Aachen Kogwa.
*  Moran whispered as a photographer.
*  Take each of their photos today.
*  I don't think they're all coming back.
*  The next day's newspaper previewed their planned ascent.
*  It showed them huddled around a photo of Aachen Kogwa.
*  The caption noted the NASA engineer at the center.
*  Just a month before, in December 1972, John Cooper was at mission control in Houston for
*  the 17th and final Apollo mission, wearing a black mustache and a headset, speaking to
*  Eugene Sernin and other astronauts on the moon.
*  Cooper was a surface operations engineer, helping guide the lunar module.
*  Cooper also wore his new mountain climbing boots to work, to break them in for what he anticipated
*  would be a difficult expedition to Aachen Kogwa.
*  Cooper grew up in El Dorado, Kansas, with a love of the outdoors.
*  He went to Oklahoma University to get a degree in geological engineering, but the flat oil
*  fields where his father worked were not for him.
*  He spent college summers working for the Forest Service and then as a smoke jumper in the
*  American West.
*  Later in the U.S. Coast Guard, he became a pilot and won awards for rescues off the coast
*  of Florida and in the Caribbean.
*  He learned at Deep Sea Dive and he climbed.
*  Cooper submitted Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya, the tallest mountains in Africa, and
*  Pope Acada Pedal, the volcanic behemoths in Mexico.
*  In 1966, Cooper joined NASA just as the Apollo program was set to get underway.
*  He had a bit of swashbuckler in him, more like an astronaut than a desk engineer.
*  He sometimes wore a beard, he smoked a pipe.
*  Around NASA's Houston campus, Cooper drove an old military jeep, sometimes taking his
*  nieces for a ride.
*  My mother would say, John, you put the doors back on and put up that windshield before
*  you take my girls with you, Deb Coons, Cooper's niece said.
*  It was at NASA that Cooper fell in love with the secretary, a young divorced woman named
*  Sandy Myers.
*  They were married in 1968.
*  In 1969, they had a baby boy that they named Randy.
*  That was the year of Apollo 11.
*  Cooper was in the surface operations group that guided Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin as
*  they became the first humans to walk on the moon.
*  Three years later, on December 19, 1972, Apollo 17's three-man crew splashed down safely
*  in the South Pacific.
*  On January 12, 1973, Cooper's flight from Houston landed in Miami, where he met Janet
*  Johnson.
*  They flew together to Argentina.
*  Cooper kept a diary of his expedition, like other men in the group who wrote in their own
*  diaries about Johnson.
*  Nothing feminine about her, one said.
*  Cooper was unsure what to make of the only woman.
*  Janet sure is weird, he wrote from the comfort of Hotel Nadevarra.
*  He went swimming in her bra, blouse, and panties today, and the pool was full of people.
*  On the mountain, the Americans struggled from the start.
*  On January 20, 1973, aided by mules and porters, the group hiked 25 miles to Casa de
*  Piedra, a stone house at the confluence of the Voccas and Relentials rivers.
*  In his diary, Cooper described, quote, the stark beauty of a landscape baked hard as concrete.
*  He mentioned that you bank, the expedition doctor, was already sick.
*  The next day, the group reached base camp, a treeless, rubbled plot, and a wide valley at
*  about 13,500 feet.
*  These days, during climbing season, it is a buzzing village.
*  In 1973, the American expedition members will be only ones there.
*  Alfonso had hired Roberto Bustos, a 25-year-old climber and student, to manage the base camp.
*  Now a retired geography professor, Bustos recalled his early impression of the group, a lot of high-quality
*  gear, but an unsettling dynamic.
*  There was no group attitude, Bustos said.
*  I was thinking, oh, I am on my own.
*  Everyone has to take care of himself.
*  In my opinion, they weren't ready for such a strange and big mountain as Aakankagua.
*  Alfonso, despite his experience on Aakankagua, was relegated to merely a guide, someone to point the way.
*  Defoe was in charge.
*  Petrosky, his friend from Portland, was the deputy leader, followed by you bank, the doctor,
*  and Shelton, the interpreter for Alfonso.
*  Then came Zeller, McMillan, Cooper, and Johnson, without defined roles.
*  Back then, like today, getting to the summit usually required a week or more of shuttling up
*  and down the mountain, moving gear and adjusting to the altitude.
*  The group carried loads to camp one.
*  At 15,500 feet, higher than anywhere in the continental United States.
*  They returned a days-end to base camp.
*  The high altitude ups and downs were made more difficult by Aakankagua's notorious offschool
*  course of penitentes, icy pillars as tall as six feet, caused by solar radiation.
*  They're sturdy enough that even the small ones can't be knocked over.
*  The group called them white monsters.
*  The trek to camp two at nearly 18,000 feet took seven hours.
*  Brother was it bad, Cooper wrote in his diary.
*  Between the ice and scree and altitude, I was done in.
*  He later wrote about others in the group.
*  Bill Zeller is the real man behind the work, he said of the Oregon State Police Officer.
*  He lugged 80 pounds up to camp one.
*  Then after getting back, he made the water hall.
*  And I'm here in the sack.
*  I guess I'll do our share of work with some more than others.
*  Johnson was little help, Cooper wrote.
*  She is a real loner and appears to be for only one thing to get herself to the summit,
*  at the expense of everyone or on everyone's back.
*  Soon the expedition fractured from the effects of altitude.
*  Three Americans, including Defoe, the leader, stayed at camp one.
*  Five others, including Johnson and Cooper, moved up to camp two with Alfonso.
*  Cooper felt miserable.
*  For two cents, I'll go back, Cooper wrote.
*  But they plotted upward to establish camp three behind an outcropping of boulders near the base
*  of the Polish glacier at 19,400 feet.
*  A storm swept through, holding the group in place for a rest day.
*  Behind it were clear skies, a perfect window for a climb to the summit.
*  The group was expecting it to take at least all day, Zeller later wrote in his account of events.
*  But the lower part of the glacier seemed to present no problem as it seemed to be in good condition,
*  no crevasses, not too steep, good snow for crampons, etc.
*  But after a late breakfast, Petroski lost coordination and struggled to put on his crampons.
*  Others diagnosed it as a sign of high altitude cerebral edema, a potentially deadly swelling of the
*  brain. Alfonso escorted Petroski back to base camp. Now the expedition was cleaved in half.
*  Gone were the expedition leader, the deputy, the doctor, the interpreter, and the local guide.
*  Remaining were Cooper, Johnson, Zeller, and McMillan. None had been this high anywhere. They barely
*  knew one another. When they looked up, they saw the Polish glacier stretching to the sky.
*  It was sunny. Their jackets were unzipped. They wore crampons, carried ice axes and carried light
*  packs, leaving most of their possessions behind. But movement up the glacier was slow.
*  By nightfall, the four Americans gave up on reaching the summit that day.
*  They were at roughly 21,000 feet. They dug a small snow cave on the glacier with their ice axes.
*  They had no sleeping bags, so the climbers lay on reflective space blankets.
*  During the night, cramped and uncomfortable, Johnson and Zeller moved outside.
*  They sat shivering. Wind blew a fine powder off the summit,
*  filling the opening of the cave with snow and burying Cooper's legs.
*  Johnson unburied him about an hour before sunrise.
*  But Cooper was finished. Cold and tired, he announced that he was turning back.
*  Zeller and McMillan later said. It was about two hours down the glacier back to camp 3,
*  McMillan figured. He and Zeller expressed a little concern about letting Cooper go down alone.
*  He appeared to be very capable, alert. Zeller later told his hometown paper.
*  He had no trouble with his reasoning. There was no concern about his climbing ability,
*  and we were not too far above high camp. John Cooper never made it. He died on the glacier.
*  Not long after, so did Janet Johnson.
*  Exactly what happened to them is speculation, spun around the globe for 50 years.
*  Two men from Oregon, Zeller, a police officer, and McMillan a dairy farmer, were the last
*  sea Cooper and Johnson alive. They gave detailed versions of events,
*  slight contradictions, and the confounding effect of high altitude hallucinations raised
*  questions for Argentine authorities and teased the public's imagination.
*  After Cooper headed downhill alone, Zeller, McMillan, and Johnson continued up.
*  They moved slowly. They took photographs. They reached the top of the Polish glacier,
*  where it meets a ridge that leads to the summit. But darkness descended again, and snow on the
*  ridge was waist deep. The men took turns breaking the trail 25 steps at a time.
*  The summit incite, the men later said, they turned to find that Johnson was not there.
*  We looked and looked and called her name, and got no answer. McMillan recalled in a letter he
*  wrote two weeks later. Finally, I stumbled across her axe and figured she couldn't be too far.
*  We called some more, and finally a faint little voice said, my name is Janet Johnson.
*  She was about 100 feet off our trail in the snow, laying there. When we got to her, she said,
*  don't make me suffer. Just let me lay here and die.
*  Zeller said that he roped himself to Johnson. McMillan said that Zeller took her by the arm.
*  Zeller said that the three got lost and camped another night together. McMillan said that he
*  went ahead of the other two and spent the night by himself. Their stories converged again the next
*  morning. Johnson wouldn't stand, and her hands were swollen and black McMillan wrote,
*  so they quote, anchor her from three different directions so we could hold her standing up,
*  and they let her pass the crevice. They reached the snow cave where they had last seen Cooper.
*  Some of their equipment was there, including the flare gun. McMillan said he shot it. It was 7am.
*  It made a noise as loud as a rifle, but I guess no one heard it below McMillan wrote.
*  Johnson's condition seemed better, so the men decided that McMillan should go down alone,
*  following the route that Cooper presumably took 24 hours earlier. McMillan said he lost his
*  ice axe in a steep section of the glacier and slid 1,000 feet headfirst. It would account for the
*  black eye he had later, he said. Then he saw members of the Argentine army coming to rescue Zeller
*  and Johnson. He heard people calling his name. He saw dead mules, and he saw dead soldier lying in the
*  snow. Only later, after following a sleep in camp, did it occur to him. None of that was real.
*  The dead soldier, he realized, was John Cooper. Up on the glacier, Zeller too was having hallucinations.
*  He later recalled visions of construction trucks working near the summit, and hearing phantom voices
*  of rescuers who were never there. Janet and I continued coming down,
*  till we were through the worst part, then we took a long spill also. Zeller wrote in an account
*  later that spring. Again, doing no serious damage but breaking both of our dark glasses and cutting
*  our faces some. We ended up three or four city blocks from camp and could see the tents.
*  He and Johnson came untethered in the fall, Zeller said, so he went back up to check on her.
*  That is when he saw Cooper. I saw John's body about halfway between us and off to the right as
*  we faced uphill. Zeller wrote, I checked him and he was dead and appeared to be frozen.
*  I didn't see any cuts on his exposed skin and no tears in the clothing, so assume that he didn't
*  die as a result of a fall, but exhaustion and hypothermia, etc. Janet seemed to be okay,
*  best as I could tell, so we decided that I would go ahead and set up the tent and she would follow
*  as soon as she got her wind. Zeller said, he arrived at camp three a couple of hours after McMillan.
*  They slept through the night, awoke, and saw no sign of Johnson, they said.
*  The next day, M, Bill and I decided to go on down, McMillan wrote, Bill was so confused,
*  he didn't know which direction to go. He concluded, that's the story as near as I can recall.
*  Questions follow them downhill, like a dry cold wind.
*  John Shelton, the college student who served as interpreter on the climb, turned 76 this year.
*  He had been receiving hospice care in a VA hospital bed in Utah for more than a year.
*  He had a cringoleic white beard and eyes that sparkled when he left.
*  He was the last American from the expedition still alive.
*  My name is John Shelton. I am 76 years old today. I was on the 1973
*  Missama expedition to Akon, Kawa. Unfortunately, it wasn't 100% successful.
*  Shelton remembered getting sick from the altitude and becoming the first in the group to return to base camp.
*  I could not move my feet. It was as if they were in concrete.
*  So I just decided this must be a sign that I'm not supposed to climb today.
*  So I packed myself up and I went back down to base camp.
*  He kept company with boostos bonding over their shared affinity for science.
*  Both were 25, the youngest in the group. A day later came U-bank and a foe, more sick than Shelton.
*  After another day came Patroski with the help of Afonzo, the guide.
*  Shelton described looking through binoculars at the Polish glacier,
*  expecting to see the remaining four climbers and spotting only three.
*  And later only two.
*  At this time, we could see them through the binoculars, but we could never find the right number of people.
*  That's when we decided that there was definitely something wrong.
*  And we started at the mountain.
*  He remembered rushing uphill with Afonzo to see whether they could help.
*  They came upon Zeller and McMillan walking toward them.
*  Shelton remembered the weight of the moment.
*  Four people had gone up the mountain, but only two had returned.
*  I looked up and I see two climbers coming down the mountain.
*  And I thought, no, this doesn't look good.
*  As they approached, it was obvious that there weren't the right number of people.
*  And they just said, John and Janis are dead.
*  That's when the shock said the end.
*  It did not occur to Shelton that Cooper and Johnson were anything more than victims of a
*  high altitude accident. Foul play, hogwash, he said.
*  Hogwash.
*  When Zeller and McMillan were telling their story, they were telling a pretty straight story.
*  And I took them as their word.
*  Everything that they told was just as I could see and you know, happening.
*  And I believe in every word of it.
*  The word traveled off the mountain.
*  Families were called.
*  Wire services and hometown newspapers wrote hasty dispatches,
*  filling gaps with presumptions and wild falsehoods.
*  In Cooper's hometown in Kansas, the paper reported that he, quote,
*  was resumed dead after a fall from the top of the mountain into a deep crevice during a blinding snowstorm.
*  The US Embassy in Buenos Aires sent a memo to the US Secretary of State's office.
*  Trying to stanch misinformation.
*  Deaths did not occur as a result of a fall as reported by United Press International
*  and Associated Press or as a result of an avalanche as reported by Reuters.
*  The embassy said.
*  News outlets in Mendoza were on the story more exhaustively and accurately.
*  The first news was reported in Los Andes on February 4.
*  There are fears for the lives of two North American mountain climbers, the headline read.
*  There was a map of the route.
*  Featured prominently were two smiling photos of Johnson and Cooper,
*  taken at Hotel Nudibara two weeks earlier.
*  The expedition was starting to fall apart before even the work on the ice began.
*  The next day's story said.
*  Just as Americans were getting false accounts of avalanches and blinding snowstorms.
*  At the base of Aakinkagua, Alfonso and the American survivors were held for questioning.
*  In Mendoza, a judge was assigned to the case.
*  So was a police investigator.
*  Officials labeled the case Avaraguayseon de Homocidio Caposo.
*  Investigation of Manzlap.
*  Even the American government validated the suspicion.
*  It was standard procedure for the case to remain open.
*  The embassy wrote in its files to quote,
*  ensure that foul play may be ruled out.
*  The seeds of speculation were planted.
*  It needs a deeper investigation.
*  Los Andes wrote.
*  The Americans returned to Hotel Nudibara,
*  hiding from reporters staked out in the lobby.
*  Boostos, the base camp manager, came to say goodbye to his new American friends.
*  They would not see him.
*  50 years on, it still saddens him.
*  The US State Department didn't have much luck either.
*  Console Wilbur W. Hitchcock tried to speak to the Americans during an overnight layover in Buenos Aires.
*  All five looked tired and somewhat dazed.
*  Hitchcock wrote in a report.
*  The sixth survivor, Ubank, had already left the country.
*  Defoe cautioned Hitchcock about the effects of high altitude on mind and memory.
*  He said that the others had experienced hallucinations,
*  and perhaps a quote, feeling of unreality coming at such heights.
*  Hitchcock returned to the airport the next morning.
*  He spent another 30 minutes trying to question the Americans before they boarded a plane to leave Argentina.
*  They were unable to reconstruct the climb with sufficient accuracy.
*  Hitchcock wrote.
*  Newspapers published a photograph from the tarmac.
*  Shelton and Petrosky smiled as McMillan appeared to say something over his shoulder.
*  They carried packs and ice axes.
*  A reporter asked Zeller to clarify the events on the mountain, papers reported,
*  but the foe stepped between them and would not let him answer.
*  If any of the smoldering speculation followed the survivors back to the United States,
*  it was quickly snuffed out.
*  In Portland, the President of Miss Amos wrote a secret memo.
*  He called for a special closed meeting of club leadership and the survivors of the expedition
*  to be held two days later.
*  None but the above named will be allowed to attend, he wrote in all capitals.
*  The location is to be kept secret, repeat secret.
*  The memo said that the idea was to quote, learn the straight of things from people involved.
*  Presumably it continued, a resultant will be the dispelling of certain suspicions,
*  uncertainties, rumors, whatever, which may have come to your attention and have been amplified
*  by the confused communications during the expedition and by conflicting or incomplete newspaper reports.
*  The meeting was held at Defoe's Law Office.
*  Two days later, on February 15, Defoe's secretary typed a three-page chronological summary of events.
*  It was a story that survivors told their hometown newspapers,
*  and it was the basis for Defoe's formal expedition report published in the Miss Amos annual in 1973,
*  which concluded that the deaths were an accident, that Johnson and Cooper were desperate to reach
*  the summit, and that quote, they probably died of pulmonary edema.
*  They did not.
*  The Johnson's and the Cooper's were religious midwestern families.
*  They trusted higher powers and government officials.
*  They grieved but did not wallow at least publicly.
*  It is unclear how much they interacted, if at all.
*  The Cooper's held a memorial service in March, but desperately wanted Johnson's body recovered
*  for a proper burial in Kansas. Cooper's father also named John, wrote letters to Los Andes,
*  to Alfonso, to the State Department, in search of help. He learned Spanish so that he could read
*  the news reports coming from Argentina.
*  Janet Johnson's widowed mother, May Johnson, held a funeral service in April at the Minneapolis
*  church where her daughter played the organ as a teenager. She did not ask for her body back.
*  She understood that her daughter had said that if anything happened to her on Acancagua,
*  she wanted to be buried in the little cemetery not far from the trailhead.
*  Like John Cooper's father, May Johnson collected newspaper clippings and documents.
*  In places where her daughter's name was spelled Jeanette by Spanish language papers,
*  and even by some American ones, she crossed it out and carefully wrote Janet.
*  And in places that quoted her daughter as saying, let me die here,
*  her mother blacked out the words so she never had to read them.
*  In Argentina, Judge Victoria McGell, Calendria Aguero, wanted to know, how did John Cooper
*  and Janet Johnson die? There could be no sure answers without the bodies.
*  In late 1973, on the crest of a new summer climbing season in the Andes,
*  a four-man team was assembled to look for them. Alfonso, wounded by criticism of his role as
*  guide, would lead it. A National Geographic reporter and photographer named Lauren McIntyre
*  heard about this and showed up to join the team. Alfonso was glad to have him.
*  They carried two plastic toboggins, the kind children used to sled down icy slopes,
*  that they had reinforced with sheet metal screwed to the bottom.
*  A week later, at the foot of the Polish glacier, they found the ghostly evidence of the American
*  expedition. Two tattered tents, a torn blue sleeping bag leaking feathers.
*  About 150 yards uphill from camp, they found John Cooper's frozen body.
*  He was stretched out on relatively flat terrain. His legs extended and crossed.
*  His hands were bare across his abdomen. His jacket was on, but his hood had fallen behind his head.
*  John Cooper was a tall and large man, and he was frozen stiff. McIntyre reported to investigators.
*  He was like a statue of ice, and the toboggin was about half the length of his body,
*  so arranging him so that his clothes and body would not be damaged in the descent
*  was not an easy thing, and it was cold and windy and temperatures were running short as we tried
*  to get him lashed to the sled. A storm blew in, the men left Cooper for the night, driving
*  stakes around him to keep him in place, and descended to the safety of camp.
*  The next day, McIntyre was first to the body and did a closer inspection.
*  He took detailed photographs of Cooper and his belongings, to quote,
*  make it supremely evident how he was equipped, in case there were questions from investigators or
*  reporters. He found Cooper's diary. He found an open letter from Cooper's wife, Sandy. McIntyre
*  read it aloud and translated it for the others. Keep roped up and don't forget the crampons.
*  As I don't know how I've replaced you, she wrote, you are by far the best husband and loving one
*  and really good dad in the entire world. There was no sign of Johnson. Back entire combed the
*  snow field for several hours before giving up, he said, he considered her death the bigger mystery
*  and thought she might have wandered off the glacier's sheer edge. Details about Cooper got out fast.
*  He was missing a crampon. There was no ice axe. He was on a gentle slope. His battered face held a
*  look of frozen terror and his abdomen had a cylindrical hole, bloody and deep. It had gone
*  undetected until his body thought at a lower elevation and his frozen hands could be moved.
*  The highest percentage of possibility is that Cooper's death was an accident. Alfonso told reporters,
*  but if Cooper had fallen on his own ice axe, it must have been very violent, he said, given the
*  five layers of clothes that he wore and the depths of the wound. Alfonso also said that Zeller told
*  him that he had found Cooper sitting dead with his head between his hands.
*  But the way Cooper was found reveals that Zeller's account was not exact, Los Andes wrote.
*  Back entire insisted that, quote, there is no mystery at all. He fell on his ice axe and he injured
*  himself. He said in a statement to investigators, he was in so much discomfort and pain when he
*  was nearly to base camp that when he finally got off the steep part of the glacier, got down on the
*  flat, he had evidently stopped, sat down and removed his gloves and was probably trying to examine
*  himself and his wound when he fell unconscious and froze to death. Back entire left a sliver of doubt.
*  In a 1974 letter to Sandy Cooper, he suggested that McMillan and Zeller, quote,
*  have probably formed some conclusions in their own minds, which may be true or which may be an
*  adjustment with conscience they can live with. He continued,
*  I wonder whether you have ever talked with them? It is unclear if the Cooper or Johnson families ever
*  did. Cooper's body, per the family's wishes, was transported to Kansas in a carved coffin,
*  shipped inside a plain wooden crate. The coffin was buried in the cold December ground in El Dorado.
*  The empty crate, separate decades in the garage of Cooper's parents, who couldn't part with it.
*  The results of the full autopsy were sealed by the judge, but he released a cover page,
*  which noted the cause of death. It was not exposure, not pulmonary edema, not even the mysterious wound
*  of the abdomen that plunged through five layers of clothes. Causa de la defuncia,
*  Catusion, Clanio and Sephaleca. Causa death, cranial contusions, injuries to the skull and brain.
*  The judge made only one declaration. We need Janet Johnson's body.
*  Alberto Colomberro was 17 when he and two others found Johnson's body. He keeps the photos from
*  that day in a small box. It was February 9, 1975. Colomberro was climbing Ocancogua with his father,
*  Ernesto, and Guillermo Vierro, both experienced Ocancogua climbers.
*  A storm forced them to abort a summit attempt. The three decided to come down the Polish glacier.
*  They knew Johnson's body might be somewhere. Colomberro saw something orange or red to his left.
*  It was obscured by knee-high penitentes, the ice pillars characteristic of Ocancogua,
*  and partially covered in fresh snow. The men thought it was a tarp,
*  a tent, maybe a backpack. They found Johnson face up.
*  My father recognized her because he had met her in Mendoza, Colomberro said. He is now a retired man
*  of 65. Johnson's face, blackened from two years of exposure, was battered in three places.
*  White bones stuck out of her nose, her forehead, and her chin, were skin hung down like a flap.
*  There were blood stains on her face and jacket. A cramp on was missing from one foot.
*  Ropes were tangled around her. Her hands were bare, her light jacket unzipped. They could not find
*  her ice-ex. The slope was shallow. Didn't Zeller say that he and Johnson had a long fall together?
*  There was no way this is where they fell, they thought.
*  Colomberro's memory holds one other striking detail. A rock sitting on top of Johnson.
*  Her body was in a field of ice. Colomberro said that he was too young and inexperienced at the time
*  to draw conclusions. But the older men who are now both deceased, they were sure Johnson was murdered.
*  Colomberro said. They thought everything was planned. Colomberro said that it wasn't an accident,
*  that someone had hit her and tried to make it look like she rolled down the hill in exhaustion.
*  Their discovery and version of events were soon highlighted in the Mendoza newspapers,
*  along with gruesome photos they took. Johnson's body was just 20 meters from where Cooper's body
*  had been found, the report said. The three men were unprepared to bring Johnson's body down,
*  so they dug it out and shifted it so that a future recovery expedition would see it.
*  They found a ring with a cloudy brown stone on her finger. They removed it and passed it to an
*  American climber named Allen Stec, who happened to be on the mountain at the same time.
*  In April 1975, he sent it to Abrahamson, Johnson's sister.
*  I am enclosing the ring that Janet was wearing when we examined her, he wrote. We did not find
*  anything of her equipment or her camera, assuming she had one. The ring is the only possession from
*  the trip that Johnson's family received for 50 years. In February 1976, William Motobano, the Latin
*  America correspondent for the Miami Herald, wrote two articles about the deadly mysteries of
*  Aakinkagua. The second focused on plans for the recovery of Johnson's body. How did Janet Johnson
*  really die, the headline read? There is sufficient mystery and enough unanswered questions surrounding
*  the death of Janet Johnson and NASA engineer John Cooper on the same 1973 expedition to have raised
*  the suspicion of foul play. William Motobano, the reporter, wrote.
*  The article focused on Ramon Arieta Cortez, the lead investigator, who quote,
*  must establish if Aakinkagua killed Janet Johnson or if she was murdered. Motobano wrote,
*  soon after a team of men, mostly police officers in Mendoza with climbing experience,
*  found Johnson's body. Her face was darker, far more memified than a year earlier,
*  because of recent exposure to sun and wind. They found no other belongings.
*  The men struggled to extricate Johnson from the ice. They crudely sliced her left arm at the
*  shoulder and left it, with a broken watch still on her wrist. We had to dig the ice to get her
*  unfrozen from the glacier, said Rudy Para, one of the men, now a retired police officer in his
*  Mendoza home. It was like taking a piece of the glacier off the mountain. The room where the Cooper
*  and Johnson autopsies were performed in Mendoza is still in use today. It sits in a worn,
*  one-story stucco building that looks like a barrack. It is equipped with stainless steel tables,
*  electric tools that hang from the ceiling and concrete floors that slope the drains.
*  Daniel O'Rajo was a medical student and an assistant to the medical examiner, Dr. Carlos
*  on the Cooper and Johnson autopsies. Today he is a neurosurgeon in Mendoza.
*  My name is Daniel O'Rajo. I was part of the team that autopsy the bodies of John Cooper
*  and Janet Johnson. Although 50 years have passed, they are still somehow phrasing my memory
*  like very few other cases. Both John Cooper and Janet Johnson, they were traumatic. It was very
*  unusual. He still remembers Cooper because of the skull fracture and especially the tubular hole
*  to his abdomen. It was like a bullet hole perfectly round. The wound was so deep that it reached
*  all the way to Cooper's spine. O'Rajo always suspected an ice screw.
*  I remember that the cause of death was the head injury, but also it was a deletion that he had.
*  It was a deletion that we had trouble to understand the mechanism or what kind of weapon was used
*  to cause it. We found a circle indented in the body of the vertebrae. Clearly suggested
*  a aggression. It's more consistent with the mechanism of stabbing and not just
*  falling over the ice screw.
*  John's autopsy stands out because of the damage to her face, bone exposed in three places.
*  O'Rajo recalled deep cuts on her boot that made him think someone had taken some hard wax at her.
*  I think that Janet Johnson had an several injuries in one of his legs. A result of repeated
*  hammering with an eye sacs over her boot and crossed through the leather of the boot and injured
*  the tissues. Johnson's autopsy report with photos was submitted to the judge. Like Cooper,
*  she officially died of contusion craniot and cephalica, a brain injury. O'Rajo has been haunted by
*  the memory of those autopsies for most of his life. I think that John Cooper and Janet Johnson
*  both were killed. The reason for that is that the kind of injuries that both of them
*  were not caused by a fall, but were inflicted by someone else. At the time the whole team
*  that John Cooper and Janet Johnson were killed, all of us used to think that.
*  News media coverage did not go that far. In quote Forensic Circles, Los Andes reported,
*  it appeared to be a crime, though the police had not made any accusations.
*  It left the case open for public interpretation yet again. Were the wounds to the head from a fall
*  or deliberate, Los Andes asked? Perhaps the truth will never be known.
*  That is where any serious consideration ended. On March 24, 1976, Argentinus government under Isabel
*  Perone fell to a deadly military coup. Argentinus was turned inside out and tens of thousands are
*  thought to have died in the seven year upheaval. Whatever formal investigation into the American
*  expedition that was in motion was turned over to the collective imagination. The mystery seemed to
*  freeze in place. Days before the coup, the body of Janet Johnson was buried in a small cemetery in
*  the dusty high mountain valley near the trail heads to Aachenkogwa. No one from her family came,
*  but among a few flower bouquets was one that rested on her coffin that read Day 2, Madre,
*  from your mother. Among the two dozen witnesses were members of the police group that recovered her
*  body, including Arieta Cortez, the investigator who led the effort. According to his son, one,
*  Arieta Cortez died in 2017 and never reached a conclusion in the case. Under the sky of America,
*  we bury a daughter here on Argentine soil. Arieta Cortez said at the graveyard gathering,
*  Alfonso, the guide, arrived late but paid his respects. Representatives from the American embassy
*  had made the 650 mile trip from Buenos Aires. The ceremony took 15 minutes.
*  I wish to inform you that your daughter, Janet Johnson, was buried on March 19, 1976,
*  pursuant to your request at the Mountain Climber Cemetery at Punta del Inca. The embassy wrote to
*  Johnson's mother, funeral services at the gravesite were very dignified and impressive.
*  A man arrived late, rushing to the service just as it ended. It was Miguel Alfonso, the guide,
*  there to pay his last respects. For nearly 50 years, a Nikol-Matt camera, carried by an American
*  woman, set frozen in a high altitude time capsule. But it was not frozen in place.
*  Where the camera was dropped may not be where it was found. The Polish glacier has been shrinking
*  and shifting, cracking and moving downhill by the pull of gravity and with the change of seasons.
*  And on a sunny day in February 2020, the heart of the Argentine summer, the camera sat on a stocky
*  penitente, like a museum piece on a pedestal. It was Marcos Kalimaro, a young porter who brought it
*  down to camp. It was Ulysses Corvalot, the experienced guide, who recognized the name stamped at the
*  bottom. As a camp that day was a photographer named Pablo Bettincorp. He recognized that the film inside
*  might be evidence to be preserved, as it had been for most of five decades. He put the camera into a
*  case and stuffed it with snow. He contacted the New York Times, wondering whether such a discovery
*  might be of interest. And he wondered what else the melting glacier might be revealing.
*  Kalimaro spent his off time looking near the glacier's edge. He found Johnson's arm in a red
*  jacket sleeve still wearing a watch. Then her knapsack filled with possessions, among them two more
*  aluminum canisters with film inside. In Oregon City, Oregon, an 83 year old widow named Julie
*  Abrahamson, Johnson's only surviving immediate family member, got a surprise call, sharing the
*  news of the discovery. Her response was clear. Yes, please develop the film. Find out everything you
*  can. Please. She's still my sister, she said. I still want to know what really happened to her.
*  Indian heads to scratch one is about an hour east of Regina. Its tallest structure is a grain
*  elevator. There is not a mountain in sight. On a downtown corner is a former bank, a two story
*  brick structure from the 1800s. Today, it is home to film rescue international run by a man named
*  Greg Miller. His small team of technicians receive and process old and damaged undeveloped film from
*  all over the world. Cases found in addicts, reels discovered in shipwrecks, the forgotten
*  islamatic abandoned with film inside. Now Miller was holding a camera that had been locked in a
*  glacier at roughly 20,000 feet for almost five decades. The camera was intact, the only crack was
*  inside the lens. The mechanisms worked. The leather holster had probably protected it from leaks.
*  It turns out an octangago glacier is not a bad place to store film. Humidity is always a detriment,
*  but the andes are notably dry. High altitude radiation can be a concern, but the camera had been
*  entombed in ice. Cold temperatures are much better for film than hot ones. Miller took the camera
*  into a dark room, flicked on an infrared light that would not expose the film, and clicked the
*  back of the camera open. I think we're going to see something, he said. The processing responsibility
*  fell to Eric LaBossea, a 35-year-old part-time pro wrestler and metal band guitarist with a bald head,
*  a soft voice, and arms covered in tattoos. He was nervous, there was only one chance to do this.
*  Under infrared light, LaBossea moved the roles of film into light-proof drums.
*  The drums went into a machine that washed the film in a cycle of solutions, precisely timed,
*  an automated version of the Duncan Soak method from an old photographic development.
*  When LaBossea emerged from the dark room, he seemed pleased.
*  Had he not known the origin of the film, trapped on a glacier in Argentina for decades,
*  LaBossea would have assumed it was on a shelf somewhere, he said.
*  After more machines and more solutions, LaBossea unspooled the film and held a stripped delight.
*  Yeah, he said, mountains and people. Johnson was a good photographer.
*  The photos are beautiful, haunting, marred only by streaks of moisture that color the frames,
*  some more than others. They turn ordinary landscapes into something closer to art.
*  One of the roles was unused. Johnson had carried it towards the summit with the apparent expectation
*  that she would need it. Another found in a canister had 36 exposures. The first frame was shot
*  from a valley just short of base camp, an ethereal image of snow-covered mountains.
*  Then came lots of penitentes and snow-covered peaks. They chronicle the expeditions up and down
*  method of moving from one camp to another, a climatizing and hauling gear. There is one photo of
*  Johnson having handed her camera to someone else. She is smiling, wearing a floppy hat,
*  and heavy-duty aluminum-framed glacier glasses. She has an ice axe in her right hand,
*  and an overstuffed pack on her back. The role found inside the camera had 24 photographs.
*  The seventh photo was taken near camp at the foot of the Polish glacier. Only Johnson Cooper,
*  Zeller and McMillan went higher than that. Johnson snapped pictures. Recent footprints
*  dent the soft snow. Around midday, the sun high and the shadow short. Johnson took a photo of one
*  of the other climbers, who was downhill and sitting on the glacier. After noon shadows got
*  longer with each photograph. Soon the four climbers would dig a cave to sleep in. Cooper would head
*  downhill to next morning, while the other three continued up. Johnson took more photos. The 21st
*  photograph showed either Zeller or McMillan climbing ahead of her into the afternoon sun,
*  each step making deep holes in the snow. Published in the Mazamas annual, later that year,
*  is the opposite photograph taken by Zeller. Downhill of Johnson hiking up to summit ridge at about
*  22,000 feet. Johnson wore her floppy hat. Her coat was unzipped and her mittens dangled from
*  strings at her sleeves. She held her ice axe in her right hand. Before dark, Johnson snapped three
*  more photographs of the surrounding andies. If she was oxygen deprived or delirious, she still knew how
*  to focus the lens, compose the frame, and hold the camera steady to take clear photographs.
*  That is where the film ends. That is where the legend begins. The film does not solve the mystery.
*  It only adds to it. It tells you what Johnson saw in her final hours, but not how she felt.
*  Not how she died. Not every discovery leads to revelation. Some just make you want to know more.
*  If Janet Johnson and John Cooper were still alive, they would be in their late 80s.
*  All of the Americans from the expedition to Aachenkogwa are gone. Defoe, the leader,
*  died in a car crash on a rural Montana highway in 1975. Zeller died in 2003, McMillan in 2011.
*  Shelton died in November, leaving behind a collection of old photos,
*  Missama's memos, and newspaper files. It remains the greatest mystery of Aachenkogwa,
*  said Moran, the Argentine journalist who covered the expedition and its aftermath. He is 80 now.
*  This story had nearly faded from popular memory, he said, but there are enough reasons for doubts and
*  arguments to make the mystery persist. Folklore happens when facts are short and time is long.
*  After all these years, this story is not about long gone Americans on the mountain,
*  but the unknown that lives in those who remain. It is less about certainty than memory and imagination.
*  A question arises again and again, among those familiar with the story. Just what are the possibilities?
*  An accident is a tidy catch-all, a useful way to move on. What if it was something else?
*  Corvallan, a dean of Aachenkogwa guides, was 59 successful summits.
*  First heard the stories from old timers when he began climbing the mountain 35 years ago.
*  There were theories and embellishments, dots connected with fuzzy lines.
*  A loved triangle gone wrong, a stash of money that was never found. Cooper as a government agent.
*  Assassins who crossed the nearby Chilean border. Is that why Laura and Macintyre and American
*  had shown up as if from thin air to find the bodies? Why was he taking so many photographs?
*  Corvallan studied Johnson's photos from 1973. He noted the shallow slope and the uncharacteristically
*  soft snow on the Polish glacier that year. A long fall and a deadly slide down the ice were improbable,
*  maybe impossible, he said. But something else bothered Corvallan. He has seen bodies ravaged by
*  even shortfalls. Bones are broken, clothing and equipment are shredded. I saw a lot of bodies
*  unfortunately in the motor, many of them, some friends. When they fell, there's a lot of broken
*  bones and blood around and sometimes you find pieces of brain. I mean filling on the ice,
*  it's almost like a free fall. Why, Corvallan wondered, did so little of that appear to have happened
*  to Johnson and Cooper? Why was the damage confined mostly to their faces? Corvallan thought about it.
*  He is a mountaineer. He has been atop the seven summits. He knows what experience and common sense
*  tell him in accident. But more than before, Corvallan believes that maybe there was foul play.
*  It's a mystery. Fowl play. It is a persistent vague euphemism in the story.
*  Negligence, manslaughter, worse? How? Why? Is it even possible at such an altitude, with such fatigue?
*  Corvallan shrugged. I don't have to be happy. I won't believe that. It's really well.
*  Roberto Bustos, the base camp manager, is now 76. He has a file of yellowed clippings and photos
*  at home. He has a rope that belonged to Shelton that he holds as a treasured memento.
*  Johnson's newly developed pictures stir memories, but do not change his mind.
*  He sees what happened to Johnson and Cooper as a quote, mountain accident, he said,
*  but does not dismiss the possibility of something violent or nefarious.
*  Norm's shift at high altitudes, he said, desperation toys with right and wrong.
*  One thing that has not changed in 50 years on mountains from Aachenkogwa to Everest
*  is the notion of ethics and responsibility. They get squishy at high altitudes,
*  amid the dangers and limits of the moment. It's a different world at 6,000 meters with different
*  laws and rules, Bustos said. And the behavior, you would go down to 5,000 meters and think these
*  people are crazy. If their climbing partners did all they reasonably could to help Cooper and Johnson,
*  wasn't that enough? If they abandoned their colleagues to save themselves or somehow did harm to them,
*  could they be blamed? Zellor's widow, in her 90s, said through her son that she did not want to talk
*  about the expedition and requested no further contact. As a state policeman, he is precise,
*  exacting and careful, the local newspaper wrote of Zellor in 1973. When he speaks, he says only
*  what needs to be said. There are mysteries of the mountain he cannot explain. He is not used to that.
*  McMillan's family said that he continued to climb mountains for the rest of his life,
*  including Denali twice, even after he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.
*  He had more than a hundred dairy cows and would give slide presentations of his
*  climbs to friends and family in the barn. His children recall McMillan talking about how he and
*  others were held and questioned in Argentina because of the deaths. They know little about any
*  speculation of foul play of the stories spun in Argentina. Judge Victoria Miguel Calandria Aguero
*  never made a ruling in the case. Shortly before he died in 2022, he was asked about the American
*  expedition by a local journalist who said that readers had followed the coverage, quote,
*  like a novel and raised a specter of murder. None of that was ever proven, the judge said.
*  And then from the ice came Johnson's camera. And whatever ghosts had been laid to rest were stirred
*  back up again. In Oregon City, Oregon, Judy Abrahamson had not gone through her sisters belongings
*  for years. They were stashed under the house, ignored if not forgotten. None of it made a lot of
*  sense. These slides of mountain landscapes and strangers and climbing gear, those yellowing
*  newspaper clippings in Spanish were her mother crossed out every suggestion that her daughter ever
*  wanted to die alone. To Abrahamson, Janet Johnson was not an accomplished climber in Colorado,
*  or the haunting name that echoes in the Andes. She was not a legend or a mystery.
*  She was Janet, a brainy 10-year-old who asked for a little sister and welcomed her to the family
*  with a doll. She was an overachiever who grew into a woman that her mother could not understand.
*  She was the accomplished big sister who set out to prove that she could do anything she wanted,
*  even climb the highest mountains. Abrahamson thinks about Johnson and wonders how she might have
*  grown old, might have climbed more mountains, might have come out, might have felt accepted, even
*  celebrated. I want to know what really really happened to her, because she was experienced.
*  In this period, two many years, but I still think about her. How many years go by, Janet was my sister.
*  What an adventure she was. How she loved life.
*  And she was a good person. And she was.
*  She was my sister.
*  In Kansas, Joy Cooper is nearly 90. The older sister who remembers John Cooper as a little boy
*  with so much wanderlust that their father had to build a fence to keep him in.
*  She remembers when people filled the church for his funeral, and they buried her little brother
*  in the little cemetery. Her parents were never quite the same after that. In Texas, Randy Cooper
*  raised by a widowed mother who had since died. Does not remember much of anything about his father,
*  but he has been told that they share some of the same mannerisms, like the way they popped their
*  knuckles. As Randy got older, he decided to go by his middle name, John. And when people ask
*  about his father, he would tell them the only thing he knew. My dad died mountain climbing.
*  The Johnson and Cooper families never learned much about what happened on Aakinkagua.
*  They just knew that things went wrong, and that Janet and John were gone.
*  The details, the newspaper stories, the letters, the official documents, all the questions and regrets
*  were swallowed up by sadness, then by time.
