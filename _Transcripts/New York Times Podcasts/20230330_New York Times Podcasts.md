*  I have a mild amount of light buzzing is that okay?
*  That's because Rob has got his mic on in that control room.
*  Okay.
*  But he's gonna turn it off now.
*  Oh, by Rob.
*  Yeah, see ya.
*  See ya.
*  That's a home run call.
*  Oh really?
*  What's that wait, can you just explain that to me?
*  So I think the lead announcer for the Yankees on television when they hit a home run goes.
*  See ya.
*  Oh, because like the ball is gone.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Not like it's going.
*  It's going.
*  Well, there's the other one.
*  The other Yankees wants it is high.
*  It is far.
*  It is gone.
*  See ya.
*  The best is when they get it wrong.
*  You know, it is high.
*  It is far and he's shaking and it's caught by the center field.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Borrow.
*  This is the daily.
*  On opening day of baseball's 2023 season, Mike Schmidt on a historic plan to save the sport
*  from the tyranny of the home run.
*  It's Thursday, March 30th.
*  So I can't believe that I'm actually going to tell you this.
*  I grew up playing baseball.
*  I remember a handful of memories from my time.
*  The top two are when I gave up home runs.
*  Gave them up.
*  Oh, meaning you were the pitcher.
*  Correct.
*  Etched in my memory.
*  Uh huh.
*  There is nothing more humiliating than standing on the mound after someone has hit the ball
*  over the fence and is running around the bases.
*  Celebrity.
*  It's just like an endless shame spiral.
*  Correct.
*  Everyone's looking at you.
*  You did that.
*  I mean, I think about these moments fairly often.
*  Right.
*  And then like, you would later grow up to cover baseball as a journalist among many other
*  beats you'd have for the times.
*  And the last time that you came on the show to talk about baseball was when the sport was
*  weathering and and is always not weathering the pandemic.
*  And the reason we asked you to come back is because baseball is now experiencing another
*  major change.
*  So tell us about that change.
*  This season baseball will operate under new rules that are the biggest changes in on
*  the field play.
*  Certainly in my lifetime.
*  If not the history of the game.
*  Wow.
*  Just give me a couple tastes of this change.
*  Well, the first one that you'll see is a pitch clock.
*  Kind of like a shot clock.
*  Sort of yeah, a shot clock.
*  But in this case, a pitch clock, a pitch clock.
*  That is a big change.
*  What else?
*  The players will be positioned differently on the field.
*  And the bases are getting bigger.
*  You won't be able to notice it with your eye, but they are bigger, but they'll now be
*  several inches wider, longer.
*  What is driving these changes, Mike?
*  Baseball is facing a semi existential threat in terms of its appeal to fans.
*  The game has become not only too long, but too boring.
*  The non baseball fan or baseball hater will sort of be laughing at that because they'll
*  say it was always boring.
*  It was always boring.
*  But it has tipped over the edge.
*  And I think as a fan and as someone who has covered the game and keeps a close eye on
*  it and still talks to people within the game, that the home run is to blame.
*  That is a provocative thesis.
*  Yeah, look, the home run is the cornerstone of the game.
*  It's the most exciting play of the game.
*  It's part of our lexicon in this country.
*  You just knocked it out of the park.
*  But the game has become addicted to the home run.
*  And because of that addiction to the most exciting play in the game, the whole game
*  has become boring.
*  So explain how it is, why it is that the home run goes from something to be celebrated,
*  and becomes part of this boring problem of baseball, how we got to this point where we need
*  these reforms.
*  So to understand that, we need to go back to the early days of Major League Baseball,
*  where the home run was this engine that powered the growth of the sport.
*  Way back in the early 1900s, home runs were not the key driving force of the game, but
*  then came the 1920s.
*  A hard hitting lefty named Babe Ruth comes along and is a power hitter and
*  Ruth captures the country's attention through his slugging.
*  And help the sport's popularity grow and set it on a trajectory that it follows in the
*  decades that come.
*  Roads cuts at the first pick and there goes the ball down the right field line, a home run
*  into the face.
*  The home run comes to create and define the iconic moments and players of the game.
*  The Bobby Thompson shot her round the world.
*  The home run and the power behind it with a bit of sort of the Americana of how strong
*  you are and how far you can hit it becomes a central part of the game.
*  And then the story of the home run takes a dramatic turn in the mid 90s.
*  Remind us what happens.
*  1994.
*  World wars and acts of God couldn't do to baseball with 28 owners and 700 players have
*  done.
*  They killed off the balance of the season.
*  The sport is ground to a halt because of a strike.
*  The two sides have been locked in a bitter impasse over the owner's demand for a cap on
*  player's salaries.
*  The World Series is canceled.
*  I think the players are pretty greedy and I think the owners are too.
*  I hate it because they already have enough money.
*  And as the sport comes out of the strike, it's it's most diminished state.
*  No one wants to go back to the park.
*  Right, this is a betrayal.
*  You didn't play incredibly damaging to the game.
*  And in 1998, as the sport is still trying to get its legs underneath it, fans witness
*  this extraordinary chase between Mark McGuire and Sammy Sosa to break the single season
*  home run record, which at the time had been held by Roger Maris at 61 homeruns.
*  That's what everybody around baseball is paying their money to see.
*  McGuire hit Sosa hit.
*  I'm not a player.
*  I just crush a lot.
*  Home run number 58 from McGuire.
*  A feel good story of two sluggers criss-crossing the country as they try to hit the most homeruns.
*  Here comes the man of the hour, Mark McGuire, who is all for him.
*  On the night of September 8, 1998, McGuire and Sosa are actually playing against each
*  other.
*  And with the commissioner in the stands and the whole country watching.
*  John, wondering if this is the ad bet, did Mark McGuire move one place in front of Roger
*  Maris?
*  Down the battlefield line, isn't it enough?
*  Go ahead!
*  There it is!
*  Sixty-fair.
*  McGuire breaks the record.
*  And in this wonderful moment, McGuire and Sosa embrace on the field.
*  And the home run has never been more central.
*  Correct.
*  And everyone's trying to hit home runs.
*  It's not just that these two players are home runs are up across the league.
*  Everyone's hitting home runs.
*  But what happens is that in the years that follow, we find out that that chase that felt
*  so good and that brought everyone back was built in part on a lie that the players were
*  using band drugs.
*  Stereoids.
*  Correct.
*  And not only does it tarnish and create questions about these new records, but it sets
*  off a series of other problems for the sport that go on for the decade plus that follows
*  as it's haunted by federal and congressional investigations into the use of steroids
*  by players.
*  And I have to imagine that that steroid use that Sosa and McGuire were involved in was
*  at least somewhat inspired by the game's emphasis on home runs.
*  So does this scandal lead to any kind of reckoning around the place of the home run?
*  It's primacy in the sport.
*  It leads to a reckoning in the sense that the sport needs to police itself from performance
*  enhancing drugs.
*  But by no means does anyone turn away from the home run?
*  What up?
*  Because a new phenomena further fuels the drive for the home run.
*  And that's the money ballification of baseball.
*  I just explained that for the 25 listeners who didn't read the book or watch the movie.
*  Teams become very focused on statistics and trying to come up with the greatest chances
*  mathematically of scoring and preventing runs.
*  This is the firm application, not just of instincts, but of math in the game.
*  Correct.
*  And numbers proliferate throughout the sport.
*  Let me give you an example of what this looks like.
*  I don't know the last time I've seen a four man infield on the right side.
*  Teams have so much data about where players are hitting the ball that they begin to rearrange
*  their defenses.
*  A lot of guys bunched over there in right field.
*  In a way that makes it much harder for a player actually to get ahead because they're able
*  to put a fielder exactly where the ball is likely to land.
*  And the ball will be hit into the shift.
*  They get it out.
*  It's only because of that shift.
*  One one and Gallo hits this one into that shift.
*  And as the sport is grappling with all of this new data and these changes on the field
*  that are responding to it, the home run emerges as far and away the most appealing way to
*  score.
*  Right because it's the only way to cut through all these data driven defenses that you just
*  described.
*  Unless you're going to put your players on each other's shoulders in the outfield to try
*  and stop the ball from going up in the fence, there's nothing your fielders can do.
*  So in the wake of a steroids scandal that wasn't part inspired by perhaps an over emphasis
*  on home runs, we get a data driven system that still over emphasizes our Uly home runs.
*  All roads keep leading back in baseball to the home run.
*  And it becomes so extreme that it leads to the problem of boredom that the sport is
*  now confronting.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So how exactly do home runs become boring?
*  Home runs almost by definition cannot be boring.
*  Home runs themselves are not boring, but everything else that comes with everyone in the game
*  concentrating on them is because instead of trying to learn how to spray the ball around
*  the field or someone that can leg out a single to a double or a triple, hitters start to
*  concentrate on doing everything they can to just try and hit a home run.
*  Players become even more patient at the plate because they're looking for just that perfect
*  pitch that they can drive over the fence.
*  They change their swing to have more of an upper cut to try and hit it out of the park.
*  But because you're swinging up, you're also more likely to miss.
*  So in the process of this happening, you end up with one of three results, a strikeout,
*  a walk, or a home run.
*  And home runs don't happen all that often.
*  So the action on the field goes way down because you don't have just regular good old
*  fashion hits.
*  Right.
*  You don't have good old fashion baseball anymore.
*  You just kind of have an endless home run derby.
*  The time between battered balls and play that goes from in the 1980s being under three
*  minutes to being almost every four minutes last season.
*  So about a minute more time between every single ball in play.
*  And of course, a minute doesn't sound like much an isolation, but over the course of
*  an entire game, I have to imagine that starts to really add up at the same time teams
*  that are pitching are trying to do everything to prevent that home run.
*  So they're bringing in different pictures.
*  They are encouraging pictures to give their max effort on every pitch to try and make
*  sure that they get that strikeout.
*  So there's no contact to the bat.
*  And all of these things are slowing the game down.
*  Correct.
*  And games become longer.
*  They become 20 to 30 minutes longer on average.
*  And so at what point does the league say to itself, all right, enough.
*  We have got to do something about this.
*  We've got to make this work more fun.
*  We've got to make it faster.
*  So it being baseball, it took a while.
*  The slow sport.
*  Thematic.
*  And in this story, there's one person who made that call.
*  Hi.
*  Hi.
*  I'm Mike Schmidt.
*  I'm here to see Commissioner.
*  So I went directly to him.
*  I went to the offices of the baseball commissioner Rob Manfred.
*  Okay.
*  I've known you for almost 17 years.
*  We have screamed at each other.
*  I thought you screamed at me more than I screamed at you, but I remember.
*  And you guys have quite a long history.
*  Go way back.
*  You know, sometimes you can't make your point without, you know, raising a decibel or two.
*  And that's fine.
*  So what does Manfred tell you?
*  So he knows there's a problem.
*  We did fan based research.
*  And it was consistent over a period of years that fans wanted a game,
*  bristar pace, more athleticism, more balls and play.
*  And so they wanted that best form of baseball back.
*  It was because the baseball is too boring.
*  I don't think it was too boring.
*  I think that baseball changed.
*  He doesn't say that baseball has a boring problem, but he confirms that there's a real pace issue.
*  Right.
*  A speed of action and length of game.
*  And he knows something has to be done.
*  And he's known that for a very long time.
*  And by a year or two into my commissionership, I had a great consensus.
*  We needed the fixed.
*  So why does it take seven more years?
*  That, you know, it was, I know you're going to laugh when I say this.
*  And exercise of discretion on my part.
*  The problem for him is that he's not truly a baseball guy.
*  Was not a player.
*  Was not an owner.
*  Didn't run a team.
*  I thought I'm kind of acting in a way that's going to change what they're doing on the field.
*  I thought that was an explosive comment.
*  But there is a labor lawyer who's going to come in until the baseball people had a blow.
*  Right.
*  So he may have a kind of cred issue.
*  Correct.
*  And then so he knew that as that lawyer, he needed to take his time and be methodical.
*  So over many years, almost a decade, he plots this change.
*  Waiting till you got an agreement so that the players understood it was coming.
*  Talking to players about them, getting the owners on board for it, testing at the minor
*  league level, what these changes would be.
*  I mean, Mike, I said we played 8,000 games in the minor league, literally, with these
*  rules.
*  You know, you play 8,000 games, you realize this is an issue and you need to make this
*  is shepherding ushering, cajoling the sport into this major change.
*  Right.
*  Making sure everybody was comfortable with it, which takes time.
*  Correct.
*  And all that work finally culminates in these new rules that are being rolled out this season.
*  So tell me more about these rule changes you started to hint at them at the beginning
*  of our conversation.
*  Let's do it in more depth and how they're supposed to actually fix baseball problems.
*  So again, there's three big changes coming this season, the pitch clock, the bigger bases
*  and where fielders can stand in the field.
*  So let me start with the fielders.
*  Remember we talked about those data driven defenses, essentially computers telling teams
*  where players should be on the field, right, which of course encourages people at bat
*  to just hit home runs over the fielders heads.
*  You can't do that anymore.
*  You have to have your infielders on the infield and you have to have two on one side and two
*  on the other.
*  You can't stack the defense on one side.
*  And because of that, it opens up much more space for a player to hit a ground ball or
*  a base hit up through the middle or through one of the holes.
*  Got it.
*  And Mike, what about the pitch clock?
*  What does that have to do with the home run on the face of it?
*  It doesn't have anything to do with the home run.
*  Sluggers will still be waiting for the perfect pitch.
*  But the fact that there's a clock means that the pitches will be coming more quickly and
*  the game will be moving faster.
*  A ticker on your screen that gives the pitcher 15 or 20 seconds to deliver a pitch.
*  And if the pitcher doesn't pitch before the clock goes off, it's a ball.
*  Got it.
*  You have the larger basis, right?
*  One of the byproducts of the push for the home run meant that if you had a runner on
*  base and you were looking at the numbers, you wouldn't want the runner to try and steal
*  because the risk of getting called out stealing was too great because if the batter hit the
*  home run, that person would never come home.
*  Correct.
*  You wouldn't get the extra run.
*  So it was worth it to not steal.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  Of course, stealing is exciting.
*  Stealing is exciting.
*  It's perhaps the most action-packed, non-home run event of the game.
*  And those larger bases, it just makes it easier to steal.
*  And it also makes the game a bit safer because bigger bases gives more space and potentially
*  less collisions.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Which is another thing that slows down baseball.
*  I have endless memories of watching the pitcher seem like they're going to pitch, stop, pivot.
*  I might try to stop you from, it's kind of endless.
*  Do you really have endless memories with them?
*  No, I have a couple of memories.
*  When the opposing team keeps on throwing over to first base, the fans start booing.
*  Right.
*  Because it's just slowing the game down.
*  And now there's a limit on that.
*  So by taking together, this is a campaign to make baseball more exciting by doing a few
*  things, elevating the other parts of the game that aren't home runs, like the base hit
*  or the stolen base and making those home run hitters, just be less of a drag on the overall
*  pace of the game.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think the way to look at it is that baseball is not trying to kick the home run.
*  Right.
*  They're trying to kick the problems and things that come with it, that there's other
*  things going on.
*  Right.
*  And there's not things weighing it down.
*  Got it.
*  Like how baseball players, who man-fred feared might not like these changes and fans have
*  been reacting to these new rules.
*  Surprisingly, it's been positive.
*  Baseball is not something that lends itself to new cutting edge changes.
*  It's a sport where the players are setting their ways and fans seem to have opinions about
*  everything and wanted to bait each other on who the best players are and when the best
*  times in baseball history were right.
*  But I think surprising certainly to me and surprising to the baseball executives that are
*  putting these new rules in place, it's been embraced.
*  These new moves to make it faster have actually made it faster.
*  Spring training games are more than 20 minutes shorter than they were last year.
*  More balls are being hit and play.
*  More players are trying to steal bases.
*  What is man-fred and I talked about, the real test starts in the regular season when
*  the game's actually matter.
*  What could go wrong?
*  That's a start to go.
*  The side risk undertaking.
*  Why was it high risk?
*  Because if you go out on the field and things go badly, the first 10 games that are played
*  in high leverage, late-ending situations, they get decided based on a pitch clock rule.
*  We don't want to see that.
*  The fans don't want to see that.
*  In theory, you could imagine moments where teams blame a loss on one of these new rules.
*  And it'll all come down on man-fred.
*  Baseball is different.
*  It occupies a place in our culture that is very, very different.
*  And it comes with the burden that when you make a mistake, people care a hell of a lot
*  more about it than if it was in another sport.
*  And sooner or later, if the criticism gets to a certain point, they'll find somebody
*  else to take the job and I'm okay with that.
*  I really am.
*  Of course, there's a very strong possibility that these rules changes won't make man-fred a
*  lightning rod that they're going to be embraced.
*  Maybe they're even going to be celebrated.
*  Right?
*  They're going to make the sport better and maybe even usher in a golden era in the sport.
*  Golden Era?
*  I don't know about that.
*  But a more appealing, faster, efficient product that is not going to take four hours to watch
*  a 9-in-a-game.
*  Good chance.
*  And in that sense, we're watching an American institution embrace new and different things
*  in a potentially positive way.
*  Which is progress.
*  Progress.
*  Progress.
*  It's a bit remarkable.
*  Oh, Mike.
*  As always, thank you very much.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  The speaker I move, the final pass is just in about 150, the B.J. of the governor, not
*  withstanding.
*  On Wednesday, Kentucky's Republican-controlled legislature passed a sweeping law that restricts
*  how health care workers and schools can treat transgender youth, overriding a veto of
*  the bill by the state's Democratic governor.
*  The bill bans access to gender-affirming care for trans children, restricts which bathrooms
*  they can use, and bars the discussion of gender identity or sexual orientation in the classroom.
*  This passage was angrily opposed by Democratic lawmakers, including state senator Karen Berg,
*  whose transgender son died by suicide last year.
*  This is absolute willful, intentional, hate, hate for a small group of people that are
*  the weakest and the most vulnerable among us.
*  And federal regulators have approved the sale of Narcan, a nasal spray that reverses opioid
*  overdoses without a prescription, making it widely available as a life-saving treatment.
*  The decision to sell Narcan over the counter could vastly reduce fatal overdoses, which
*  have claimed the lives of tens of thousands of Americans over the past two years.
