# Footballâ€™s Young Victims

*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Oborro. This is The Daily.
*  They started playing football as young as six years old. They died in their teens and
*  20s with CTE today. My colleague John Branch on the growing body of evidence that a
*  disease many believed was reserved for professional athletes is also afflicting young amateurs.
*  It's Tuesday, December 19th.
*  John, we wanted to talk to you because you have spent many years trying to understand
*  what's been happening to the brains of athletes who play contact sports. And you have been
*  talking to researchers who study those brains and those researchers recently told you about a major
*  new discovery. So tell us about that. Yeah, so what we're talking about when we're talking about
*  brain damage in contact sports athletes is CTE, which stands for chronic traumatic and cephalopathy.
*  And what this is, it's the brain disease, progressive brain disease caused by concussions and
*  hits to the head. And for the most part, CTE has been connected with, at least in terms
*  of public perception, aging football players, hollow famed style football players, you know,
*  Ken Stabler, the Earl Morals, people in junior say, out, they're now 300 and some former NFL
*  players who have been posthumously diagnosed with CTE. But what's new now is that for the first
*  time these researchers have gathered this growing subset of young brains, of young people, people
*  under the age of 30 into a profound study. And it shows, you know, things that we knew or suspected,
*  but it puts it in very, in very stark terms. Young athletes, even teenagers, as young as 17 years
*  old, are getting CTE and feeling the effects of it. And these researchers at Boston University have
*  found cases of CTE in more than 60 brains of young athletes who have died. Some of them were really
*  advanced cases, which is genuinely startling, right? I mean, that would seem to completely change
*  how we think about the very idea of CTE. Yeah, I think where this changes the mindset for us is,
*  this is afflicting people who are just in high school, who are maybe just in college, who had no
*  aspirations to go to the pros. You know, these are people who are starting from a really young age,
*  suffer the same kinds of symptoms that we've seen in the pro players, things like memory loss and
*  impulse control in Somnia. They're having troubles with substance abuse and severe depression,
*  and sometimes ultimately even suicide. And once John, you absorb this new research and the
*  implications of it, what do you do with all that? We wanted to go talk to some of these families
*  whose children had been part of this data group. You know, these are families who have watched their
*  child decline for reasons they couldn't explain. And they now have information that tells them a
*  little bit more about what might have been behind those confusing years, all those signs that they
*  couldn't make sense of. And we wanted to understand how they processed that new information,
*  knowing now what that answer might be. And which of those families stands out to you?
*  Well, there are several. All right, well, thank you both. But I would say that the family of
*  Hunter Foreaker, let's start chronologically. Tell me about his parents Bill and Kim Foreaker.
*  Still really stick with me. And 1992 Hunter was born in May. Why the name?
*  Bill came up with that name. Bill, can you tell us why?
*  It was Colorado-y and as it turned out, it was perfect for him.
*  Hunter was a kid who grew up in Colorado. And when I went to visit his parents,
*  they really reminisced about how great his childhood was.
*  We lived in the mountains. We had a chocolate lab named Hershey. And we hyped every day.
*  How much he loved the outdoors. Fishing hunting, skiing. How much time they spent skiing and hiking
*  and doing things up in the mountains. Hunter was definitely a Colorado boy.
*  Yeah. His parents described him as quiet but also very mature, never a trouble maker. And when he was
*  seven years old, he began to play tackle football.
*  The name of the team was Cougars and Bill was the coach.
*  His father Bill thought the best thing to do would be to coach my own child. To teach him the game,
*  to teach him how to play it safely. That was concerned if he was going to play a
*  contact sport like football that I was there to supervise.
*  And so he coached his son all the way until his son got up to high school.
*  He was lights out. He excelled. I mean, levels that they'd never seen before in a kid that
*  young in high school. He becomes a star at Mollen High School, which is one of the big powerhouse
*  football programs in Denver. And sometimes in his mid teens, was it during his sophomore summer?
*  Yeah. Hunter sustained a concussion, a pretty serious concussion.
*  I never knew during the scrimmage. I knew he was acting a little different but nothing alarming.
*  He was woozy afterward. It seemed to have shaken it off the way a lot of kids do,
*  but on the way home that day. He started to vomit. He threw up in the car.
*  The forehikers then took him to the hospital and then to his pediatrician.
*  His pediatrician looked him over and he said, Hunter, you're a big kid, you're tough,
*  you got your bell rang, go get him, you're going to be an all-American.
*  In other words, go back to the football field. Go back to the football field and that's exactly
*  what Hunter does.
*  He becomes the captain of the football team, his junior and senior year. That football team
*  goes on to win a state title and Hunter is an all-state player. But off the field, there were some
*  challenges. Some of them felt like normal high school stuff to the forehikers and some of them
*  didn't, especially in hindsight. There were some signs of him getting a bit of a temper.
*  He began to drink a little bit and a lot of kids do. How big of a concern is it? He was also
*  having nightmares. He had horrible nightmares and I asked him to please explain to me these nightmares
*  and he said they are so effing bad I cannot begin to tell you what they are.
*  So he started getting some therapy and they thought he was okay. He was doing well in school.
*  He's playing well on football, but Hunter was not the type of person who thought he would ever
*  go professional. I think football to Hunter meant a way to a higher education. A lot of these kids,
*  my dream of the NFL, that was not really his dream. His dream was actually for the best education
*  possible. He saw a football as potentially a useful tool to get him into a better school.
*  He fell in love with Dartmouth and sure enough that's where he went because Dartmouth and New Hampshire
*  reminded him a lot of Colorado with the mountains and the outdoor activities.
*  And what happens to Hunter once he gets to Dartmouth?
*  Yeah, so he plays on the JB team, his freshman year, and does very well.
*  And then during training campus sophomore year, he has another serious concussion.
*  And it took him about a week and a half to really fully recover. He was foggy. He would report
*  serious headaches. And he was really uncomfortable with the way concussions were handled.
*  Hunter told his parents he had seen some of his other teammates with concussions and saw how they
*  hurried back despite having symptoms. And then I remember having a conversation with him that
*  it scared him to death that he's witnessed other football players on his team that have had concussions
*  and that he knows it and they would just go right back in. And he said, you know what, this is not
*  for me. This is not really the reason why I'm here. I'm here to get an education. And he quit
*  football. So he understood these hits he had been taking as accumulating to something that he
*  no longer wanted to be a part of. That's right. And what happens once he walks away?
*  Well, he continues there at Dartmouth, focuses on his studies and actually graduates with a double
*  major in environmental science and anthropology. And he stays at Dartmouth to work for the Alumni
*  Relations Department. From Bill and Kim's perspective, he seemed to be doing okay. But there were
*  some worrying signs. Some of the issues that they had seen in previous years from him seem to be
*  intensifying. He seemed to be drinking more and more. His nightmares seem to be getting worse.
*  He started to talk a little bit about loneliness and depression, which they accounted to the fact that
*  he was still at Dartmouth while most of his friends from the undergraduate years had moved on.
*  And then they get a call. And he said, mom and dad, I'm so sorry, I really f'd up. And we were like,
*  what did you do? Because this kid was never in trouble. And he goes, well, I drank too much. I
*  ended up at Hitchcock. Hunter was at Dartmouth Hitchcock Hospital. And they told him he was an alcoholic.
*  That's where he first got labeled. So he spent a year or so. You know rehab detox, rehab detox.
*  In and out of rehab, in and out of detox. It was just the circle. Drinking became a bigger and
*  bigger problem. I know the nightmares were horrible. And he was just trying to survive. I think
*  that is part of the reason he was binge drinking was to get those thoughts out of his mind.
*  To clear those thoughts. What do his parents think is happening at this point? How are they making sense
*  of what he's going through? Well, it's impossible, right? Because they're trying to make sense of
*  small clues, phone calls and notes, things they hear. You know, he's not living with them. So it's
*  hard for them to know. They have 1.100 told him that he had been diagnosed as bipolar and with
*  depression and anxiety. And he had been given medications. His weight had dropped by at least 50 pounds.
*  He was just skinny, no muscle tone on his shaven, uncapped. You know, those were alarming
*  science tests that something was wrong with him. But at the time, we were still hearing from
*  the professionals that he is an alcoholic. And this must just be what happens to one's body.
*  And then they got a call one day, one winter. When they had not heard from him for a few days,
*  and he was supposedly on a ski trip in Colorado and found out that Hunter had attempted suicide.
*  He had tried to drink himself to death. His intoxication level was the highest they had ever
*  found a person to be and they could not believe that he was still alive.
*  And at that point, Hunter goes back into rehab and into counseling. But after a few weeks,
*  he seems to be better. Things seem to be clicking for him. He had cleaned up. He was freshly
*  shaven. He had a nice haircut. He had a new clothes that fit him nicely. And we thought,
*  oh, he's sober. He's on the right track. He's turned a corner.
*  Just to kind of point out how this went back and forth. And just as soon as you think things
*  are getting really dark, now you start to see the light and you start thinking, maybe he's moving
*  forward. Maybe this is a positive step here. He actually got a job, a good job in Dallas.
*  And so Kim and the couple's daughter helped move Hunter into an apartment in Dallas.
*  He seemed so happy. The old Hunter. He was just the old Hunter. And we were thrilled for him.
*  And they left there and went back home thinking, Hunter's in a really good place. Whatever
*  all that was, he seems to have worked his way through it. But a few days later, he stopped answering texts.
*  So Thursday, we tried to get a hold of him.
*  No answer. Couldn't reach him. Friday called him.
*  Hey, he went less, less, less, base time, less Skype, texting, no answer.
*  And over the course of a weekend, by Sunday, I was I was frantic. Monday morning
*  up over the top. They couldn't get a hold of him and finally called the police to do a wellness check.
*  Finally, hours later, we get a call. We get a call back.
*  That was that was that.
*  And they found that Hunter had shot himself that he had taken his own life.
*  The worst news you ever want to hear.
*  You know, the worst news you ever want to hear, you lost your child.
*  So after the police find Hunter, the local corner goes to the apartment and notices all the football helmets
*  that Hunter has and calls the family and says, have you considered donating your son's brain for
*  research? The corner obviously understands there's a connection between football and brain disease.
*  And the forator family would not consider this turned around at that moment and said, yeah,
*  yeah, we're desperate for answers. We want to know what happened to Hunter.
*  And if this helps us understand it, then by all means, let's donate his brain.
*  So Hunter's brain ends up in Massachusetts at the same brain bank that has examined the brains
*  of all these famous football players, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of brains.
*  And the researchers then call Kim and Bill and say, your son had stage two, CTE,
*  out of a four stage scale, severe case of CTE, especially for somebody that age.
*  And then we started asking questions, of course. What exactly does that mean?
*  You know, what are the symptoms? And then she started telling us and then it just came
*  together and it was like that that was Hunter. That's exactly his actions, his change in
*  his lifestyle, his everything. It just started coming together.
*  And so in some ways, they were relieved. They had an answer for what happened to their son.
*  All these inconsplicable things that he had been going through the last few years, now suddenly
*  kind of made sense. They could be explained in some way.
*  But it also struck them with a hard piece of guilt because they're the ones who put them into football.
*  You know, how could we have let our child get harmed to that point? How could we ever
*  have let Hunter in a sport that damaged his brain to a point that gave him stage two CTE?
*  I mean, that is something an NFL player has.
*  And I feel
*  a tremendous amount of guilt because I was there, coaching the whole time.
*  Something.
*  We'll be back
*  John, I want to better understand the research at the heart of this reporting that you have
*  been doing.
*  And you mentioned it briefly at the beginning of our conversation, the work of these researchers
*  at Boston University who've been studying the brains of people like Hunter Foreaker.
*  So take us more deeply inside of that research and into its specific findings.
*  Yeah, so this study is focused on brains of young athletes under the age of 30.
*  And since 2008, between 2008 and 2022, they collected 152 of them.
*  And what they have to do is to take them into a lab and they literally slice them into
*  really thin sheaths and put them underneath a microscope.
*  And what they're looking for is the buildup of what they call tau proteins.
*  And what tau proteins do basically is tangle the neurons in the brains, not unlike what
*  we see with older people who have dementia or Alzheimer's.
*  So the researchers take a look at slices of the brains from the 152 samples that they
*  have of people under 30 years old.
*  And they find CTE in 63 of those brains, a little bit more than 40% of them had CTE.
*  That's a lot.
*  Yeah, it sounds like a staggering number.
*  I think surprised even the researchers.
*  We have to be clear that this is a biased sample.
*  People are donating these brains because they are looking for answers.
*  So it's a no way to suggest that 40% of kids who play football or anything else are going
*  to have CTE.
*  But yeah, more than 40% of the brains that they had had CTE.
*  Among those are athletes who are as young as 17 years old, 18 years old with very severe
*  cases of CTE as bad as many of these NFL football players and hallfamers that we've been
*  talking about.
*  And it crosses a lot of sports.
*  We typically associate this with football.
*  And that's where most of these brains came from, where the families of football players.
*  But there were other sports as well.
*  Hockey, soccer, boxers, and a question athlete, rugby.
*  These are all contact sports that are now seeing increasing numbers of people with CTE,
*  including young people with CTE.
*  Something you just said seems a little hard to wrap your head around, which is that there
*  are cases where these young athletes have CTE that is as serious as professional athletes
*  which is very counterintuitive.
*  I mean, even a young athlete who plays football for a long time doesn't evoke the kind of
*  hits that I think of when I think of professional football.
*  So how do the researchers come to understand that?
*  Yeah, I mean, this is all part of the nasty trick of trying to figure out what CTE is and
*  who gets it and why.
*  The researchers don't know why somebody is more apt to get it, why somebody is more apt
*  to get more severe cases of CTE.
*  Michael, you and I get out the same career.
*  You and I can play football through our youth and into the pros for 20 years.
*  I may have a severe case of CTE.
*  You show no signs whatsoever.
*  And part of the difficulty of this is that this is not just involved in concussions that
*  we see on TV every Sunday where somebody is maybe knocked out and carted off the field.
*  CTE is the product of subconcussive hits as well.
*  And subconcussive hits are those hits that maybe don't even register to the person who's
*  absorbing them, certainly not to anybody else who's watching.
*  If you think about the NFL or in football, the offensive linemen and defensive linemen
*  are banging heads every single play.
*  Right.
*  CTE, they believe, is basically the accumulation of the total force that you're taking.
*  That force can be in several big hits or it can be thousands of little ones.
*  And so what you're talking about with kids is when you're putting them into football at
*  the ages of six or seven, those hits add up.
*  So according to this theory about subconcussive hits, in the case of someone like Hunter, what
*  ultimately mattered to his CTE might not have been those two big concussions he suffered
*  one in high school, one in college, it may have been ultimately countless, smaller hits
*  he took over his career that he didn't even notice all the way back to when he was in
*  B.W.
*  Football.
*  That's exactly right.
*  I mean, his family knows of two big concussions.
*  They don't know if Hunter had a lot of other ones he never owned up to.
*  They don't know if he had a lot of ones that maybe he thought were just minor hits that
*  he felt and maybe made him feel weird for a day or two.
*  And they certainly don't know how many thousands and thousands or whatever the total might be,
*  hits he took in every single practice from the age of seven through the first year or
*  second year at Dartmouth in college.
*  But you know, that's 10 or 12 years or more of football and being hit in the head a lot
*  of times.
*  Well, given that reality, what do these researchers say about the overall safety of any version
*  of youth context sport, especially football, but really any of the sports that we've been
*  talking about here?
*  Yeah, the researchers say essentially don't do it.
*  Are they that explicit?
*  Yeah, they believe that, you know, look, in this country, we're not going to stop the
*  hits in the NFL.
*  And at this point, we're probably not going to stop them in college.
*  And maybe even in high school and some of these communities that are, you know, worship
*  tackle football.
*  But one thing they believe we can do is to stop letting kids from the ages of five or six
*  or seven or eight hit themselves in the head, often tell these they're in high school.
*  So their recommendation is anybody under say the age of 14 or anybody before they get
*  to high school should not be playing tackle football.
*  If it really truly is an issue of number of years of exposure to hits, we know most people
*  are not going to go play in college.
*  Very few people are going to play in the pros.
*  So how much CT could we eliminate by just eliminating them tackling when they're young?
*  Hmm.
*  In other words, limit the exposure to the four years of high school for most people, which
*  is a lot of years potentially of brain damage, but it's fewer than if a kid starts when
*  they're five or six.
*  That's exactly right.
*  I'm curious.
*  Are these recommendations, are they focused just on football or do they extend to other
*  youth contact sports?
*  There are now other sports that are certainly more aware of concussions and even sub-concussive
*  hits.
*  An example might be soccer where a lot of the youth leagues now are banning heading of
*  the soccer ball because soccer players now have been shown to have CTE.
*  Well, they're not hitting each other like football players on every play where they're getting
*  a lot of their hits are from just heading the ball.
*  And that's a sub-concussive hit.
*  And now we know there might actually be a long-term ramifications to that.
*  Right.
*  John, you had mentioned that Hunter's parents, when they learned of his diagnosis of CTE,
*  looked back at his time as a player with a lot of guilt.
*  How have the parents of the other young athletes in this study who were also diagnosed with CTE
*  handled that news?
*  And what did they tell you about how they now think about football and what their kids
*  were doing?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, there's certainly a lot of family that are on board with the idea that young kids
*  should not play football, at least to a certain age.
*  And they regret what they had their kids do.
*  But not everybody.
*  In fact, we talked to a couple families who are still deeply involved in football.
*  One of them who lost their son, the father is the head football coach at University of
*  Maryland.
*  He believes football does so many good things for kids that even though his own son had
*  CTE, he is still involved at the highest level of the game.
*  The 18-year-old who had stage two, his parents say if they had it do over again, he would
*  still play football.
*  That's going to be hard for some listeners to wrap their heads around.
*  The idea that a parent whose kid is diagnosed with CTE posthumously doesn't regret them
*  playing football and doesn't want to discourage anybody else from playing football.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of people that seem simple, right?
*  But it's complicated.
*  And it's complicated for these families who are going through the worst thing that any
*  of us could ever imagine.
*  The tricky part of this is that CTE is, there's not a straight line between CTE and the
*  ultimate death of your child.
*  Some families will say, look, I know CTE maybe had some factors in the decline of my
*  child, but he was going through a lot.
*  There were some other mental health issues.
*  There were changes in his own life.
*  I can't draw a straight line between what happened to him and CTE.
*  And so I wouldn't want to take away what might sound so much joy.
*  That for all those years growing up, those are the best times in his life.
*  And if I can't necessarily say that that's exactly why he's not here anymore, then why
*  would I take that away?
*  There's something I think ultimately very sad about the way we got to this entire conversation
*  John, which is, as you said, you can't diagnose CTE when somebody's alive.
*  The only way we get here is because so many young people suffered so much that many of
*  them took their own lives, donated their brains to the scientists in Boston.
*  Therefore, it feels like the only way we're going to keep getting a deeper understanding
*  of this is through the death of more and more young athletes.
*  Yeah, I mean, unfortunately, the brain banks are going to grow with the brains of young athletes.
*  I think it's just the fact that CTE is just mysterious enough and intangible enough that
*  people are able to sort of ignore it and think, you know what, it's probably not going
*  to happen to my kid.
*  And I'm not going to be the one that pulls him off the football field because of some fear
*  that is probably unrealistic.
*  But as we found out from these families, it is realistic.
*  And there is a cultural awareness now that didn't use to exist, probably didn't exist
*  10 years ago.
*  In that, even kids today and certainly families today, increasingly are aware of concussion
*  issues and CTE.
*  One of the families that we spent time with was the family of Wyatt Brownwell.
*  He took his life at the age of 18 and had stage two CTE, a very severe case of CTE, the
*  worst of the as seen in somebody so young.
*  Hello.
*  So what this is, this is me explaining what's wrong with me.
*  The moments before he took his own life, he recorded a video in his car explaining his
*  decision.
*  My head is pretty messed up and damaged to be sent to family and loved ones.
*  The voices and demons in my head just started to take over everything I wanted to do because
*  my life for the past four years has been living hell inside of my head.
*  And he says it's all because of football.
*  I took a lot of hits through football, a lot of hits through football, took a lot of
*  concussions and a lot of times I've never seen it.
*  And all the concussions that he took, including the ones that he never told anybody about.
*  Dad, I know you're capable of doing this and I want you to do it.
*  His last request is to his father.
*  After my funeral, which will be an open casket, I want my brain donated to be studied.
*  I feel like it'll be closer for me and it'll be closer for you guys to know that maybe
*  why it suffered from brain damage.
*  Maybe that was the reason.
*  So do that for yourself.
*  I would like that to be done.
*  Basically, why it was predicting his own CTE and he was absolutely right.
*  Well, John, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need, tender day.
*  When Monday Pope Francis gave priests permission to bless same-sex couples, his boldest step
*  yet to make the Roman Catholic Church more welcoming to LGBTQ Catholics.
*  It was a major about phase for the church, which has long argued that any official approval
*  of same-sex couples amounted to blessing a sin.
*  But the church stopped short of allowing priests to marry gay couples, which remains forbidden.
*  And the governor of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, has signed a law that permits Texas police
*  to arrest migrants who illegally enter the state from Mexico, setting up a legal showdown
*  with the federal government.
*  It said that such arrests are needed to allow Texas to reduce illegal crossings in the
*  state, which exceeded 60,000 over the past year.
*  But according to Democrats and immigration activists, it would violate the U.S. Constitution,
*  which gives the federal government not states the power to enforce immigration law.
