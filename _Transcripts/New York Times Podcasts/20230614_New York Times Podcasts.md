*  Okay, this is a daily producer, Michael Simon Johnson. I am in downtown Miami. That's got to be one of the coolest looking courthouses I've seen for sure.
*  And now I'm trying to find Luke Broadwater. Oh, there he is.
*  Luke, how's it going? Good. Yeah. I'm all right. That's an actual rooster just walking around. There's roosters everywhere. This is crazy. This is normal. Where are we and what are we doing?
*  We're at the federal courthouse here in Miami on a hot June day. Ridiculously hot. Ridiculously hot day for the arrangement of Donald J. Trump, the first American president to be
*  a rain on federal charges in the history of the country. And you know, it's a historic day, but really a sort of a circus-like atmosphere has broken out here outside the courthouse in the lawn.
*  The police force here said they were ready for a crowd of up to 50,000. I don't think we're anywhere close to 50,000. We're probably more about 5,000. There's 10 set up all over the place. A lot of them are for the media, but there's also, I would say, thousands of Trump supporters in here.
*  It's really taken on the field of Trump rally. I mean, it's, you know, make America great again hats everywhere. Let's go Brandon flags, ultra-magot T-shirts. I'm looking at...
*  We want to! We want to! We want to! We want to! We want to! We want to! We want to! We want to!
*  This guy is wearing a Cuba flag and an American flag, and he's holding up... looks like a pike with a pig's head through it. I think that's a real... yeah, that's a real pig. This guy took a real pig's head, shoved it through a stick, and it's like standing here, talking to people.
*  There's a lot of anger, but also festivities in the air. It's very much a festive mood. Yeah, I would say the mood here is jovial, despite what's happening.
*  Go Brandon! Let's go!
*  This is the Rodding! Just this for Trump! Just this for Trump!
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Babaro. This is the Daily. Today, three dispatches from the arraignment of Donald Trump on 37 federal charges over his handling of classified documents.
*  Luke Broadwater was outside the courthouse in Miami. Glenn Thrush was inside the courtroom, and Maggie Harerman was at Trump's home in Bedminster, New Jersey.
*  It's Wednesday, June 14th.
*  Okay, we can do some interviews if you want.
*  Hi, sir. We're with New York Times. We have a few minutes.
*  From Hollywood, California, but I used to be the former official ambassador of Beverly Hills. I flew about five hours, so I didn't get much sleep, but I'm...
*  You know, you briefly described what you're wearing today. Yeah, it's a tuxedo, red tuxedo, black top hat.
*  You're wearing a gold chain that says, in Trump we trust. Yes, top hat that says, we love Trump.
*  And then your sign says, Trump to Santa's 2020.
*  I'll tell you, you know, because if anything, if Trump were to get convicted, DeSense is, I think he would win, and he could pardon him.
*  Who wants that? Who wants that? Who wants that? Who wants that?
*  Defense people handed out in flyers.
*  The next boy to appear is Adam Mavait from his family. The presidential candidate for the Republican Party.
*  On January 20th, 2025, if I'm elected the next U.S. president, to pardon Donald J. Trump for these offenses in this federal case, and I have challenged.
*  I have demanded that every other candidate in this race either sign this commitment to pardon on January 20th, 2025, or else to explain why they are not.
*  Thank you. Thank you.
*  How you doing? Good. What's your name? Good problem.
*  Yeah, how you doing? Good. I'm Michael Johnson. Michael knows to meet you. What's your name?
*  I'm James. What? I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James. I'm James
*  It's like supporting your your your favorite football team, or I'm a best Boston Red Sox fan.
*  I always risk all the time, but this is Trump day so let's put on the Trump stuff. Let's put on the Trump stuff.
*  What motivates someone to travel all the way from Dallas? Well, one is that I love what he did for
*  our country when he was president, and I think he's being treated unfairly, so we heard
*  to support him, but I know there's a whole lot of people that love him, and we're standing
*  behind him and praying for him. Have you read the indictment? No I've heard about them
*  but yeah. Did you see the picture of the boxes in the bathroom with the
*  classified material? I saw those and I saw the ones that were in Biden's garage
*  you know behind his car. I saw those too and you hear about all those things so
*  all of this all of this is being blown way out of proportion. They're just
*  looking for anything and everything. How come a lot of people aren't talking
*  about all those boxes that Biden had in his garage? I know Fox does sometimes
*  but that's about it. Well there's a special counsel investigating that as well
*  a different one so we don't know what's but how. Funny how that didn't go anywhere
*  in it and how about those 30,000 emails that that that what's your name had?
*  Hillary had. Yeah but you see here's the point if they don't want to end
*  out her and they don't want to really investigate Biden then get off his back
*  but see they don't want to they're scared of this man and you you would
*  think oh this guy sounds just like a guy that watches Fox all the time. No I've
*  got a brain and I can see what's going on. It's a barrage of these attacks on him
*  but you don't see that on these other people. What the Justice Department would
*  say I think is that in some of those cases there wasn't the intent to
*  obstruct afterwards but that Trump jerked them around for a year and a half.
*  They say that. They say that. What do they say about Hillary? You're racing 30,000
*  emails. Oh well you know it doesn't really matter. It was very irresponsible but
*  that no one would prosecute. Yeah you're responsible. That's a tough word in it.
*  Well let me ask you this why didn't Trump who under the Justice Department was
*  last four years prosecute Hillary then. I don't know. Maybe they just don't I don't
*  know. I have no idea but there's proof they should at least look into it. Here
*  let's indict the guy. Oh and by the way let's sit his trial date during the
*  primaries next spring. Let's not do it now. Let's wait till the primaries next spring.
*  You know can we not see the injustice and all of that. So you think they're looking for
*  anything on trouble they can get. If he walked across this row and in the
*  light which way they came from Jay Rock. So the allegation that they they have
*  Trump on tape saying that he that he has. I have no I don't think anyone besides
*  them has heard it. I understand. And I'm not being
*  precinct. I hadn't heard it either. We just heard the transcript in the indictment.
*  Yeah. You're saying until until we hear it. We can now. Yeah we have don't know.
*  Yeah. I know this. They were swearing up and down. I have to shift. Swared up and down.
*  Oh yeah all this Russian collusion. Oh man I'm swearing up and down. This is true.
*  It wasn't. They been swearing stuff about Trump for a long long time. You're saying this is kind of a familiar
*  story with them. To me it's just one more attack. Then you've got the thing in New York going on.
*  Seriously the littlest things and now they're making big things but you sure didn't make big things out of
*  what Hillary did. So I would just always think he was just treated unjustly and I'm not being a homey
*  a Trump guy. I can write me down as a home if you want to. Thanks so much for chatting with us.
*  Yeah thank you. Yeah so Donald Trump is supposedly inside the building we hear. He's gone out.
*  He's Trump arrived somehow discreetly underground somewhere and went into the court house.
*  I wonder how long it'll take for the judge to see him and for the arrangement to take place.
*  Glenn once Donald Trump enters the courthouse we can't really see anything but you can because you were in that building.
*  So walk us through what happened and what you were able to see. Well sometime around two o'clock maybe a little
*  later we spotted a modicative four SUVs entering sort of an underground garage area at the courthouse.
*  From that point in time we are told he was taken to a holding area with the US Marshall Service where he was
*  electronically fingerprinted. This is not an ink deal. This is him sort of rolling his hand over an
*  electronic scanner. He was not given a mug shot. The Marshall Service sort of joked we have plenty of
*  images of Donald Trump on file around two thirty five p.m. reporters including myself were led into the
*  courtroom. We had expected to sort of sit there and have Trump brought in but we walked in and Trump sat at the
*  defendant's table flanked by both of his lawyers and Walt Nauta his co-defendant sat a few feet to his right.
*  And just to remind people his co-defendant is someone accused of essentially conspiring with him to
*  obstruct the federal government's efforts to find and retrieve these classified documents.
*  Exactly his co-defendant is a former White House aid you would call him his body man he sort of does
*  everything for the president and he is accused of helping Trump move around a bunch of boxes before
*  the FBI before the Justice Department and even before Trump's own lawyers got a chance to look at that
*  paperwork and they are there together in the courtroom together yes and Lohan behold about 20 feet away
*  from Trump on the other side of the courtroom sat Jack Smith the special counsel interesting so Trump
*  is kind of talking with his lawyers there's even a couple of jokes exchanged but then the atmosphere
*  changes abruptly at 2.45 pm a court worker shouts out the camera in this courtroom has been activated
*  so that all the press who are downstairs on the fifth floor can see everything. Trump immediately
*  stopped talking to his lawyer and stared into the camera for a good minute and his expression which
*  had been tense but relatively relaxed stiffened up and that is the demeanor that he maintained
*  for the rest of the hearing and what's the expression on Trump's face. I didn't see his face but I
*  saw his back. Trump had his arms crossed and he was so tense you could see sort of the muscles
*  pushing through the back of his blue suit jacket he was not a comfortable guy and then the judge
*  enters the courtroom and it's not the one most people would have expected to see that's Aileen
*  Cannon who is a Trump appointee who had previously issued some very pro Trump rulings. It was this
*  little known magistrate judge Jonathan Goodman who just by luck of the draw happened to be a
*  sign the preliminary hearing in the case and he seems to be the only one either on the prosecution
*  cider defense side who is relatively relaxed he greets everyone he's talking to the president
*  in differential terms he reads Trump his rights and then he asks Trump if he wants to enter a plea
*  and then Todd Blanche one of Trump's lawyers stands up and says infatically we most certainly enter
*  a plea of not guilty. What else does this judge say to Trump? Well the only real sticking point in
*  this hearing was this question of whether or not Trump can still communicate with Walt Nauta who
*  still works for him and is on his payroll and other potential witnesses in his security detail
*  and his political operation on his personal staff and it really gets to the core of the entire case
*  that the people around Trump are also perhaps the most important witnesses in this case and a lot
*  of them are still around him. So how do you negotiate that? How do you allow somebody to remain on
*  your security detail or continue to work on your political campaign when they could be a potential
*  witness? In other words if I'm cutting right to the core of this Glenn and correct me if I'm wrong
*  there's a fear that Trump is going to pressure his body man who is now his co-conspirator into giving
*  testimony that would be favorable to Trump something that would be made significantly easier by
*  the fact that Trump works with this guy day in day out. Yeah it's just a tangled mess.
*  Whether or not Trump gets to be in communication with these folks what the nature of the
*  communications what restrictions on those communications are going to be there was about 15 minutes of
*  sparring on that and there was a resolution of sorts which was basically Walt Nauta can't talk to
*  Trump about the case he could talk to Trump about everything else but how do you really enforce that?
*  Okay so how does this arraignment ultimately come to an end? Well that's what's most fascinating.
*  Jack Smith is sitting 20 feet away from Donald Trump and they both have to exit the courtroom.
*  Trump leaves first through a side door on my right and then a minute later almost choreographed
*  Smith gets up walks through the gate and exits on precisely the opposite side of the courtroom.
*  It was probably just the way that things played out but it really looked like both of them didn't
*  really want to have to bump into each other. And then when it was all over we took a deep breath and
*  realized we just witnessed something that had never happened before. A former president of the United
*  States being brought into a courtroom and charged by the federal government.
*  Well Glenn thank you very much. Thank you.
*  We'll do it back.
*  Hello.
*  Hey Maggie. Hi Michael. Hi hi hi can you hear me? I can hear you.
*  Okay so this is what cell phone quality sounds like.
*  So I just want to explain Maggie why we're reaching you on your cell phone and not one of these
*  you know highfalutin high-tech higher quality sounding devices that we usually use.
*  I am sitting underneath a table out on the patio at the administer where reporters are
*  it's gonna be sitting out here for the next 50 hours or so waiting for Trump to come speak after
*  his arrangement. We have no send cover and there is no Wi-Fi that they're making available to us
*  so this is how you and I are speaking. Got it. So as I said I am speaking to you from under a table
*  where someone just kicked me in the back and you know someone.
*  I mean the things you do for us Maggie. I am a devoted member of the New York Times
*  Dean. There you go. Okay so to the matter at hand Maggie now that Trump has been
*  arraigned and has entered a plea of not guilty in this federal indictment we're turning to you
*  from administer from under this table to understand what his defense is going to look like. His
*  legal defense for the courtroom and his defense in the court of public opinion. So let's start Maggie
*  with what you have come to understand his legal defense might look like. Sure so Michael the legal
*  strategy is by far the biggest challenge for Trump in this case but because of the severity of
*  the charges the potential for jail time and because the indictment contains so much evidence that
*  the government says layout Trump's criminal behavior when it comes to these classified documents
*  and to obstruction of their investigation. So at a 30,000 foot level Michael their plan is to try to
*  slow this process down and to tall sand in the years of legal process. And what does sand in the
*  years look like in the case of a federal indictment of this scale. Well the emerging sense is it's
*  going to look like a couple of different things and they haven't said specifically what it'll be
*  but we anticipate just based on their public comment the Trump lawyers are going to use the legal
*  system to argue that the prosecutors in the special counsel Jack Smith office who brought this
*  indictment against Trump did something wrong but they committed prosecutorial misconduct along the
*  way. Okay and what might prosecutorial misconduct be when it comes to the special counsel's
*  office. I mean just help us understand what that might look like. Sure so one thing that we know
*  is that there have been sealed motions filed or a sealed motion filed to try to obtain transcripts
*  from the grand jury proceeding. The idea is basically the Trump lawyers would pour over these
*  transcripts looking for things that they could object to that could show bias or misconduct
*  or inappropriate behavior with the grand jury. And we know one thing that they might be looking for
*  is to suggest the prosecutors did not behave appropriately when they were dealing with interviews
*  with a couple of Trump lawyers. And Trump's legal team might be suggesting that because we now know
*  from the indictment that some of Trump's lawyers and this is quite unusual were compelled to provide
*  testimony against Trump by the special counsel and that some of that testimony was very powerful
*  in convincing prosecutors to bring these charges against Trump. So yes a couple of them testified
*  but one in particular was a very significant witness and that was Evan Corcoran. Now Corcoran had
*  copious notes including at least two that he took an audio files and then there were transcripts
*  and some and those served as something of a roadmap for prosecutors who were investigating this.
*  Now Corcoran was compelled to testify by a judge. It was not Corcoran's choice. Turning over
*  those notes was compelled by a judge but that has proven to be a truly significant turning point
*  and they're going to try in particular I believe to say that the notes from this lawyer Evan Corcoran
*  should not be admitted into trial testimony and evidence. Got it. And do we know what specific
*  argument they're likely to use as to why this lawyer's notes and anything else he said
*  shouldn't be used in this trial? They're going to I suspect make the same argument that they made
*  before the judge who ordered them turned over in the first place which is that there is no legitimate
*  reason to pierce the attorney client privilege because this was a bridge too far. Now a lot of this
*  is going to depend on how well leasing that judge's decision and saying that they had to be turned
*  over in the first place but we will find out. Right and we've talked about this with some of our
*  colleagues Mike Schmidt Ben protest. The reason why the government was able to pierce the attorney
*  client privilege was because they believed there's evidence that Trump the client committed a crime
*  and therefore the lawyer's traditional privileged conversation with the client loses that privilege
*  that's the thinking so they would need a very strong argument that that's not true. Yes that's
*  correct. Maggie do we know there to be any other pieces of evidence that the Trump legal team is
*  targeting and seeking to basically knock out of this case get tossed out. That's what we know of
*  right now there's not a ton of other evidence we know if they're going to point to as inadmissible
*  we do know they're trying to argue that there is political bias in the background of at least one
*  of the prosecutors involved. In other words a conflict of interest that might make the prosecutor
*  ineligible or wrong for the case they might try to take that up could that possibly
*  result in the entire indictment in some way being tossed out. Well that's what they're going to
*  try it's a high bar to get the indictment tossed out but I suspect you will see all kinds of
*  efforts along that lines. Well to that point let's assume at some point this does go to a trial
*  right and that these efforts to slow the process get things thrown out only goes so far then Trump
*  needs a legal argument for why what he did was not a crime what do we think that legal argument
*  might be. So that Michael we do have a feel for so far because of things he said and the lawyer
*  said he's argued and I think he and they will keepard that he was allowed to take these documents
*  from the White House under something called the Presidential Records Act which governs the
*  ownership of presidential records. And what does that act actually say? So that act here's what it says
*  here's what Trump says it says in Trump's selling under this law Trump has a few years to go through
*  all these papers to figure out what he could keep and what he has to return to the National Archive
*  the law does not say that it says that all records must be returned before a president leaves
*  offers. So he's arguing there's some window of time that he still says he's in
*  in which he can rifle through papers and decide what's his and what's the government's
*  and the law you're saying doesn't really say that but that's his interpretation of it.
*  Yes that's what he's saying is interpretation is Michael and I think that's going to be a
*  pretty hard thing for him to argue with court. His defense so far Michael is basically court
*  of public opinion as opposed to things that will stand up in a court case. Now we will see what
*  happens when he has a legal came assembled but right now these are not strong arguments these
*  so mega you have nicely teed up Trump's approach to defending himself in the court of public opinion
*  rather than just the courtroom and we started to get a look at that over the past few days but you
*  have been talking to those around Trump about what exactly is at the heart of his public relation
*  strategy so walk us through that. Yeah sure so so much of this field familiar Michael and it's on
*  back several years now you play the victim you blame the deep state or you blame Democrats
*  right punish Republicans who stray for disoylty but the fact that this is the second indictment of
*  Trump and that it's a federal indictment from Joe Biden's Department of Justice changes the
*  dynamic and how does it change that familiar dynamic you just described. So he and his allies see
*  this indictment as a chance to end the primary race before it is even the gun. They see this as
*  a chance to squeeze his main rival on the census in the Republican primary from one side to try
*  to end that race before it is even begun in the minds of Republican voters by describing this as
*  him Donald Trump in an active battle with President Biden. Okay explain how that's going to work and
*  explain how that's going to help him with his legal was. Sure so the way they're framing it and the way
*  they hope voters will see it is that the Biden administration is indicting Trump because it most
*  fears Trump and because he's the guy to beat in 2024 and because he is the leader of this movement
*  they're going to say that Biden went after his chief opponent that Biden weaponized the Justice
*  Department and turned them to go after the person leading the Republican primary poll but this is
*  the only way to take on Donald Trump is to take him out legally. The Biden White House has
*  strenuously denied that has said this is an independent Department of Justice but Donald Trump
*  is going to capitalize on the fact that his supporters do not rule that. Got it so the way Trump
*  and his allies see this indictment is as allowing them to more naturally more easily more convincingly
*  portray the Republican primary is kind of like not a big deal not really even a thing because
*  ultimately it's Trump versus Biden and Biden has made it so by allowing his Justice Department to
*  indict Trump. This is as we write and I anticipate that it will swing back for attacking other
*  Republicans amongst down the road but for now it really is about ahead to head with Biden and Trump.
*  Mikey I'm curious what Trump's opponents make of the way he's seeing this moment as one where he
*  now zooms ahead and sort of doesn't really need to participate in a primary. Well they're not enjoying
*  it obviously people who are running for president or a president primary don't want to be seen as
*  also ran under any circumstance and they certainly don't want to be told the race is over just
*  so that's really beginning and their sign-eat as to how to handle it Michael you've seen
*  non-descentive threat kind of plush as free towards suggesting Trump maybe did something wrong
*  but also suggesting that there is selective prosecution. You have really only seen a very slight shift
*  from Tim Scott and Nikki Haley towards suggesting that Donald Trump did something that was inappropriate
*  or at least that the charges are serious. You've seen Chris Christie and Aza Hutchinson
*  continue to attack Trump over the charges but as long as they are the only two we will be doing
*  that aggressively not much changes. Mikey it's really interesting we actually saw another
*  version of this Trump narrating kind of setting the terms of all this play out actually in front
*  of the courthouse where he pleaded not guilty when another one of his rivals the VAC Ramaswami
*  held the news conference and he said that if he wins a nomination he's going to pardon Donald Trump
*  that's going to be one of the first things he does and he challenged the entire rest of the
*  Republican primary field to make the same commitment to promise to pardon Trump. I have two
*  questions for you one do you think that pardoning Trump made up being a litmus test throughout
*  this Republican primary and two do you think that these folks could actually follow through and
*  carry that out if they win? I definitely think there's going to be pressure on candidates to say
*  Michael whether they will pardon Trump and I think that could get very uncomfortable particularly
*  on a debate stage if everybody is together you definitely understand that other Republicans who
*  want to become president need his support and need him to not try to undermine them should they
*  beat him and that provides him some level of comfort that it might be somebody's interest those are
*  Republican who become president to court. I think I want to translate that because it's fascinating
*  the idea you're raising. Trump might lose the Republican primary and yet the winner of the primary
*  let's say it's Rhonda Santos let's say it's Chris Christie they would go to Donald Trump and say
*  please endorse me and I think we have to imagine both of us knowing Donald Trump that he would say
*  something like sure I will endorse you if you promise to pardon me. I could see him not just
*  intonating that but saying it and I think that any Republican candidate who either had one
*  denomination or close to it would feel compelled to at least seem to Trump that they were him
*  or any of this idea whether they would follow through is anybody's guess but I think that candidate
*  to the habit of saying something to win a primary that they may not necessarily do want to happen.
*  Well Maggie thank you very much we appreciate it Michael thanks for having me
*  I'm gonna climb out from the table um I will talk to you guys later thank you bye bye Maggie
*  today we witnessed the most evil and heinous abuse of power in the history of our country
*  on Tuesday night in a speech from Bedminster Trump called his arrangement a day that would live
*  in infamy and a sailed president Biden for in Trump's telling allowing it to happen.
*  Very sad thing to watch a corrupt sitting president had his top political opponent arrested on fake
*  and fabricated charges of which he and numerous other presidents would be guilty right in the middle
*  of a presidential election in which he's losing very badly but Trump told the crowd that the
*  charges against him would only make him stronger as a candidate for president but they will fail
*  and we will win bigger and better for whatever you do. Meanwhile the calls from Trump's
*  Republican rivals to pardon him only grew after Trump's arrangement another candidate in the
*  Republican race former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley said that if elected she too favored
*  pardoning the former president we'll be right back
*  here's what else you need to another day on Tuesday the federal government offered the latest
*  evidence that its long-term plan to lower inflation is working consumer prices rose 4% in May
*  down sharply from a peak monthly increase of about 9% last summer.
*  Inflation remains high by historical standards but it now appears that the federal reserve's policy
*  of repeatedly raising interest rates to push down price increases is achieving its goal.
*  And the Times reports that 22 members of the U.S. Army's secretive Delta Force Commando unit
*  were injured over the weekend during a helicopter accident in northeast Syria.
*  The military has refused to say what mission the commandos were on when the accident occurred
*  but Delta Force has previously carried out raids in that part of Syria against the Islamic State.
