# Inside Russiaâ€™s Crackdown on Dissent
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oq6DhOJgieg)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Days after Russia invaded Ukraine, the Kremlin made it a crime to oppose the war in public.
*  And since then, it's waged a relentless campaign of repression, putting Russian citizens in
*  jail for offenses as small as holding a poster or sharing a news article on social media.
*  My colleague Valerie Hopkins has been reporting inside Russia on those who continue to speak out,
*  despite the risks, and explains why their government is so determined to silence them.
*  It's Tuesday, April 11th.
*  Valerie, tell me about this reporting you've been doing about dissent in Russia.
*  Well, as we've discussed before on the show, Sabrina, I've been trying to understand how
*  Russians really view this war. We know there's a sizable group that fully and completely support
*  the war. And the images that we see quite often in the West and in Western media are of people
*  enthusiastically supporting the war, clapping for Putin, waving flags at the rallies, and sending
*  their boys off to fight with cheering. But actually, you know, being on the ground in Russia,
*  you can slowly find a different picture emerging. And what is that picture?
*  Traveling around Russia the past six months, I've been actually surprised by how many people tell
*  that they hate this war, including many who, once they find out I'm a foreigner, usually in
*  hushed tones or quietly, tell me, like, they really want me to know that most people that they know
*  don't support this war, that not all Russians support this war, that they're ashamed, and that
*  they're really sad about what's going on, even if they feel powerless to do something about it.
*  And actually, a recent poll even showed that 20% of Russians openly admit to opposing the war.
*  But Valerie, how should we think about that number? You know, we're not seeing mass protests on the
*  street. The Russian government doesn't really seem to be under that much public pressure to
*  change course in its war in Ukraine. Right. It's a lot of people, but they're
*  not exactly visible. And that's because since the very beginning of the war, the Kremlin has made it
*  very, very dangerous to speak out. As soon as the war started, the Kremlin immediately banned news
*  that wasn't state controlled. You could be arrested for saying the word war or holding it
*  on a poster or writing it in an article. Instead, you're supposed to call it the,
*  quote unquote, special military apparition. But it didn't stop there. There's been a year-long
*  crackdown, and it feels like the stakes are constantly rising and the circle of people
*  being targeted is constantly widening. So for me, I've been really wanting to focus on this
*  crackdown and the people who are being swept up in it. Because I actually think that if you look
*  really closely, it tells you something about the nature of the Kremlin's power in Russia.
*  How much it fears that a small group of open dissenters has the potential to grow into a much,
*  much bigger one. So let's talk about those people, Valerie. Who are these Russians who are
*  voicing their opposition to the war despite these really dire repercussions?
*  You know, they're actually all really different people. You might think there's like a profile,
*  but there are sort of middle-aged guys in the provinces, young, hip, highly educated college
*  students. There's a lot. But one of the cases that really stuck out to me was a teenager named
*  Olesya Krivtsova. She lives in a town outside of Arkhangelsk, very close to the Arctic Circle.
*  And for our first interview, actually, a colleague of mine went and met her in her home on a windy
*  day in February. I connected over a call on the messaging app Telegram.
*  So Olesya is 19. She's a student at University in Arkhangelsk, studying advertising and public
*  relations. She's a vegan and a feminist, and she's living like a pretty normal life of a young person
*  in Russia at the beginning of 2022.
*  She didn't really consider herself to be an activist.
*  I got the sense that like most university students, she's
*  kind of finding herself and figuring out what she cares about.
*  But when the war in Ukraine started, she thought it was so incredibly senseless that she had to speak
*  out. Like many young Russians, she talked to her family and friends about it, and most of them
*  agreed with her that the war was wrong. And she starts doing some quiet acts of protests.
*  A month into the war, she got this pretty intense tattoo of Vladimir Putin's face on the body of a
*  spider with blood dripping down the fangs. It's on her leg, and it has a caption that says,
*  Big Brother's watching you. But at this point, she's not speaking out publicly, right?
*  No, no, no. She has her social media channels, which she keeps private. But at a certain point,
*  it became apparent for many Russians that this war was not going to end anytime soon.
*  And last May, she actually decided to do something publicly for the first time.
*  On May 9th, it's when Russia celebrates Victory Day, the end of World War II, and a really important
*  time for Russia's national psyche and probably one of the biggest national holidays in Russia.
*  Right, the day that in the Kremlin's telling, the Soviet Union saved the world from fascism.
*  Right, Sabrina. But this year, with a war going on in Ukraine,
*  this year the holiday hit her differently.
*  It made her so angry that Russians are celebrating peace while bombing people in Ukraine.
*  So Alessia made some leaflets with her friends, and the message was, World War II veterans also
*  live in Ukraine, and they are dying from shelling now. This war must end.
*  So what happens? She and her friends make these leaflets. What do they do?
*  Well, she actually goes around the city putting them up in different houses and residential
*  complexes. And then they all went home. But the next day, the authorities came to her apartment
*  and they'd seen the license plate of the car that she and her friend were using
*  as they drove around the city distributing these things.
*  And who exactly came to her apartment? Like, was it the police?
*  No, they were people from what's called the Center E, the Russian Center for Combating
*  Extremism, what Alessia refers to as the political police.
*  And she said they forced her to apologize personally to the armed forces of Russia on camera.
*  They actually had a video camera with them that she had to talk on?
*  Yes. And when I've seen them around Russia, they always have tiny little handheld cameras.
*  And what happens to her? I mean, do they give her some kind of ticket or warning or something?
*  So because this was her first offense, something that's known as administrative in Russian,
*  she was fined, but it will stay on her record. And basically that comes with a warning of if you do
*  anything like this again, you will have a criminal trial and the penalties are much higher and
*  include prison time. So this is really, I mean, it's a first warning, but it's a very important
*  first warning, right? Because if you do something a second time, you could face prison. Exactly.
*  And so naturally, she completely scales back her activity. She doesn't go to any protests or do
*  anything else more publicly and limits herself to speaking out on Instagram occasionally and
*  feels pretty safe doing that because her account's private. But as it turns out,
*  even that was a step too far. And how exactly is posting a private message to Instagram a violation?
*  Well, fast forward a few months to December 26. She stayed up all night preparing for finals.
*  She finally goes to sleep around 7 a.m. and her mom leaves for work. And all of a sudden she
*  hears a voice in her apartment. She thinks maybe it's her grandma checking on her,
*  but it's not. It's actually the Russian authorities, a swarm of men yelling at Alessia to get down on
*  the floor. And while she's face down, she looks up and sees a man holding a sledgehammer above her
*  head. A sledgehammer? Yes, her mind is racing. And she thinks they might actually kill her.
*  But she started trying to think and she thought, okay, maybe there are so many people here that
*  wouldn't just kill me in my own home. And she realized that they were just trying to intimidate
*  her. They take her down to the station eventually and that's when they tell her that
*  she's being investigated not only for discrediting the Russian Armed Forces,
*  but also for justifying terrorism.
*  Whoa, so what is that about? There was actually a group of Alessia's classmates who had been paying
*  very close attention to what she was posting on Instagram and actually had reported her to the
*  authorities for some of her anti-war posts. Basically a group of her friends had snitched on her.
*  Yep. And there was one post in particular that they brought to the attention of the authorities.
*  It was after the Ukrainians bombed a bridge connecting Russia with Crimea.
*  And what she said was she understood why Ukrainians were rejoicing about it.
*  It's really this post that becomes the center of the allegations against Alessia.
*  And four of her classmates are the key witnesses in the prosecution's case against her,
*  in which she faces a prison sentence of up to 10 years.
*  10 years? Did you talk to the students who turned her in?
*  Well, I tried to. There was this group chat in which some of the students were discussing
*  whether or not they would denounce Alessia. And I actually saw some of the screenshots.
*  And one of the students at one point during this debate says, denunciation is the duty of a patriot.
*  Wow. And I actually got his phone number and I tried to call him.
*  And he answered the phone. But as soon as I identified myself as a journalist
*  and told him I was writing about this case, he hung up.
*  But then I went to Alessia's university. I wanted to see what other students thought about this
*  case. And I wanted to see what kind of effect it had on the campus. So I went to the university
*  with a photographer colleague and we split up. And I started
*  introducing myself to some students. And it was a little bit strange.
*  Some people were just automatically hesitant to talk. But
*  most people just kept saying they had no idea about the case, that they'd never heard of it,
*  that they didn't know what I was talking about. And at first I thought, how do they not know?
*  And I came away with the impression that on a campus of this size, it would be pretty impossible
*  not to know about it. And that showed me the extent of the chilling effect that this had on
*  the student body. And then all of a sudden I got a message from my colleague
*  who wrote to me that she saw someone following us, probably from the FSB, the Russian
*  Intelligence and Security Agency. But someone following you? Yeah. I mean, this happens when
*  you travel in the Russian regions, but it's always a bit nerve wracking because you don't know what
*  consequences it has on the people that you're talking to. I really want to make sure that no
*  one I talk to gets harmed because they talk to me. So once I knew I was being followed,
*  I said goodbye and realized that my chances of getting more students to talk were pretty slim.
*  But eventually I was able to talk to the head of Alessia's department at the university.
*  He's 42 years old and he's in favor of the government and in favor of the war.
*  He actually wrote a negative character reference for the prosecution, even though Alessia said she's
*  never met him. Oh, wow. So he's part of the case sort of in a way. Yes. And what did he tell you?
*  So I asked him what he thought about Alessia and what he thought of the case, especially
*  at an academic institution where students should be free to debate things.
*  He said that he thought there should be limits to the kind of debate students could have.
*  And mostly he described Alessia as having been ideologically hypnotized, meaning that she had
*  been exposed to too much dangerous sort of Western propaganda, films, movies.
*  He actually said that in wartime, you know, soft power like that
*  can be weaponized and is dangerous and that Western culture should be restricted in Russia.
*  So he was saying basically that Alessia had been brainwashed, brainwashed by Western-ness.
*  And he also said that the informers, you know, the students that turned her in,
*  he referred to them as part of a healthy immune response to a wound or a disease in society.
*  He basically compared Alessia's public distaste for the war to a bacteria
*  or an infection.
*  And he said these students were part of the
*  organism of a healthy immune system of a society that were actually,
*  you know, making sure that the society didn't get more sick.
*  To prevent contagion.
*  Exactly.
*  He said the system worked exactly as it was supposed to.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Valery, where did Alessia's case stand when you interviewed her?
*  So, Valery, where did Alessia's case stand when you interviewed her back in February?
*  When I first talked to her, she was at her house arrest awaiting trial.
*  She had to wear an ankle bracelet that tracked her location.
*  It was right across on her other leg from her Putin tattoo.
*  And she wasn't allowed to use any technology.
*  So she felt super alone.
*  Actually, her mom was kind of her only lifeline to the world.
*  And she said that in general, she was really scared and that every night before she would go to bed,
*  she and her mom would hug and say goodbye because they kind of never knew what would happen the next day.
*  So she really could be taken away at any minute.
*  Right. And I mean, she had to go to court hearings every month.
*  And she was hoping that they would let her defend herself.
*  But she knew that they could also just actually put her in jail immediately.
*  So she kept a packed bag at all times that she would take.
*  And what are those court hearings like?
*  Well, a few days after I talked to her the first time.
*  I actually traveled to our hangels to attend one of those hearings because I thought it would be
*  probably my only chance to really talk with Alessia in person and see her.
*  And we were brought into a pretty small courtroom, a big cage where the defendants normally sit,
*  takes up half the room.
*  And Alessia was there.
*  And, you know, seeing her really underscored to me how young she is.
*  She's wearing a butterfly headband and, you know, a long skirt.
*  She's quite petite.
*  And we were waiting for the proceedings to start when something kind of unexpected happened.
*  A Russian TV crew approached me and started asking me repeatedly rapid fire,
*  what was I doing there?
*  Why was I interested in the case?
*  What do you think about the war in Ukraine?
*  Do you support Western weapons being used against Russian soldiers?
*  I was pretty shocked, I have to say, and I was stunned.
*  And my heart was beating pretty fast.
*  But I told them that I was just doing my job like they should be.
*  Wait, were they there to cover the Alessia case or were they there to talk to you?
*  Like, why were they asking you these questions?
*  I don't actually think they were there to cover Alessia's trial because
*  they didn't ask her any questions when she spoke to the press ahead of the trial.
*  And they also left almost as soon as it started.
*  Oh, wow.
*  So it was kind of hard to tell what they were up to exactly.
*  But the hearing itself was relatively uneventful.
*  And in the end, the judge decided to leave Alessia under house arrest.
*  But then later that night, I realized why the television crew was interviewing me.
*  The exchange I had with the Russian TV reporters was part of a segment
*  on the local news about foreign interest in Alessia's case.
*  So you were on television?
*  Yes. And they presented us this boring, bog-standard procedural case.
*  And not like a teenager on terrorism charges for an Instagram story on her private account.
*  So at this point, your reporting on Alessia is really starting to come under the same kind of
*  scrutiny as the dissent itself, right?
*  Well, it's certainly coming under scrutiny.
*  It drove home to me the idea that actually the Kremlin is so focused on this,
*  that it's not just the dissenters themselves, but also the people covering them
*  and sending their message out into the world.
*  Because inside Russia right now, it's very hard to get information about these dissenters.
*  And the international media are actually one of the few groups of people left able to report on it.
*  So what's next for Alessia? When does she go to trial?
*  Well, I stayed in touch quite frequently with her mom because Alessia is not allowed to use technology.
*  And then all of a sudden, one day last month, her mother called to tell me that she had some
*  pretty major news. Alessia had managed to escape Russia and made it to Vilnius, Lithuania.
*  Wow.
*  She was ecstatic.
*  And so when I was finally able to speak to Alessia directly a few days later from Lithuania,
*  she told me a little bit about what happened.
*  She said that there's this secret network of activists who help to spirit people out.
*  It's really underground.
*  She had to completely disguise herself into a different person. She was wearing
*  a man's big ugly coat.
*  And there was a sort of hopeful tone to our call. We were talking, she was actually walking around
*  in Vilnius. She was staying in a group apartment where people were sleeping.
*  You could hear the birds chirping. Spring had arrived also for her.
*  And she's walking around taking in her surroundings and seeing just those Ukrainian
*  flags hanging everywhere in Vilnius and also LGBTQ rainbow flags.
*  Very different from Russia.
*  Yes, that's all banned in Russia.
*  What did she tell you? Like, why did she decide to leave?
*  Well, she told me that at first she felt really determined to stay and fight.
*  But she said she realized that at these court hearings that would essentially decide her entire
*  future and her fate, nobody was actually listening to her. Nobody was taking her seriously.
*  She realized that nothing she could say would change anything.
*  And she decided to leave because she became desperate.
*  She was desperate.
*  She knew it would be really painful. Her grandmother was old and sick, and she knew that by leaving,
*  she actually might never see her again.
*  And considering that Alessia is not going to spend the next 10 years in a Russian penal colony,
*  she's got off pretty well, you know?
*  But even a best-case scenario in this case means losing your home country, your home,
*  your family, your mom, you know, the life you were building for yourself.
*  But she also said that the real heroes are the people who stayed behind, no matter the consequences.
*  So Alessia's story is the story of someone who resisted, but who ultimately fled, right?
*  But whether she goes to prison or flees the country, in both cases, it's ultimately a win
*  for Putin because it's one less voice of dissent. Like he's trying to cleanse the country of anybody
*  who has the potential for political opposition. What about the people Alessia's calling the real
*  heroes, the people who don't escape and go to prison? What about them?
*  The government has detained more than 20,000 Russians since the start of the war.
*  And I've reported on a few of those cases. I remember one sentencing that I went to about
*  a month ago that really stuck with me of a man named Dima or Dmitry Ivanov.
*  On the surface, his case is a lot like Alessia's. He's also a student. He's 23. And his crime was
*  actually reposting information from Western media about the killings in the Ukrainian cities of
*  Bucza and Mariupol. And, you know, Sabrina, it's actually really fascinating now that these trials
*  for anti-war activists are one of the few places that like-minded people can actually gather in
*  public and show their opposition to the war. So many people come in support. I think at Dima
*  sentencing, there was probably about a hundred people. And they do this even though the court
*  keeps track of who appears as a spectator. It's customary in a Russian courtroom for the accused
*  to say a final word, a statement, you know, before the sentencing.
*  He said, we can't stop the war right now, but that doesn't mean that we're powerless.
*  I want each of you to think about what they can do personally.
*  Our problem is our inability to take the initiative and find like-minded people.
*  We're used to following leaders and waiting for orders. Don't wait. Act. Become volunteers.
*  Help refugees. Support political prisoners. Form horizontal ties. Meet your neighbors,
*  colleagues, and classmates. Set common goals and achieve them together.
*  Don't walk by when someone needs your help.
*  Then he continued, we like to repeat the words, Russia will be free, like a mantra. But Russia is
*  us and what it will be depends on us only. Russia will be free because we will make it that way.
*  And right after the speech, the judge delivered the sentence. Eight and a half years in prison.
*  She asked him, do you understand the sentence? He said he did. And then the guards let him away.
*  So, Valerie, going back to the beginning of our conversation, you know, why the Kremlin is so
*  afraid of resistors like Dima and Alessia, it's essentially because they're showing a path forward
*  for Russians who disagree with the war, but until now have been too afraid to act on that.
*  Like that 20% we were talking about. Dima is essentially saying here, you don't need to go
*  to jail, but you do need to act and do something small. Meet people, talk. And that is very
*  threatening to the state because the Kremlin knows that that kind of thing is contagious.
*  Like the rector at Alessia's university said, if it's left unchecked, it can spread.
*  Yeah, for the Kremlin and for Putin especially, you know, it's existential for them to maintain
*  the image that they do have broad support, that the war has broad support, and they are doing more
*  and more to try to force everyone to get in line or at least not do anything that would pierce that
*  image. And if this war is going to end, there is a very high chance that it will come from people
*  like this. And that's something Dima knows and that's something the Kremlin also knows.
*  I think it's what Putin fears the most.
*  So Valerie, I think now is a good time to bring this up. Two weeks ago, after this sentencing,
*  I got a text from you. You sent me a link to a news article about a Wall Street Journal reporter,
*  Evan Gershkovich. He'd just been arrested in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg. He was accused of
*  spying. And it was the first time since the Cold War an American journalist had been arrested and
*  charged like this. I'm looking at your text. You said, this is very, very bad. And then you said,
*  I'm on my way to the airport.
*  That's true. It's really painful. Evan and I were good friends in Russia. So his arrest came as a
*  complete shock. I left Russia some hours after the charges were announced. And so did some other
*  Western reporters. And that just means there'll be fewer people paying attention to the trials
*  of political prisoners like Dima, listening to him give his last word, and fewer people really
*  trying to understand how ordinary Russians feel about how their country is changing.
*  And in this way, Russia becomes even less knowable, even more difficult to penetrate and understand.
*  Exactly.
*  Valerie, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back. Here's what you should know today. A mass shooting at a bank in Louisville,
*  Kentucky, Monday morning left four employees dead and nine people wounded. This is awful.
*  I have a very close friend that didn't make it today. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said he
*  knew several of the victims. And I have another close friend who didn't either and one who's at
*  the hospital that I hope is going to make it through. The gunman, a 23-year-old employee of the bank,
*  was killed by police. And in Nashville, the city council on Monday voted unanimously to return
*  Democratic lawmaker Justin Jones to the state house. Voters in District 52 elected Justin
*  Jones to be their voice at the state house. And that voice was taken away this past week. So let's
*  give them their voice back. The move comes four days after Jones and fellow Democrat Justin Pearson
*  were expelled for leading a gun control protest from the floor of the house.
*  Voters in. Mr. Clark, close the machines. Take the vote.
*  Within an hour, Jones was sworn in and back at his seat
*  in the Republican-controlled legislature that had voted him out.
