*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverny-Sea, and this is The Daily.
*  Days after Russia invaded Ukraine, the Kremlin made it a crime to oppose the war in public.
*  And since then, it's waged a relentless campaign of repression, putting Russian citizens in jail
*  for offenses as small as holding a poster or sharing a news article on social media.
*  My colleague Valerie Hopkins has been reporting inside Russia on those who continue to speak
*  out despite the risks and explains why their government is so determined to silence them.
*  This Tuesday, April 11th.
*  Valerie, tell me about this reporting you've been doing about dissent in Russia.
*  Well, as we've discussed before on the show, Sabrina, I've been trying to understand
*  how Russians really view this war.
*  We know there's a sizable group that fully and completely support the war.
*  And the images that we see quite often in the West and in Western media are of people
*  enthusiastically supporting the war, clapping for Putin, waving flags of the rallies, and
*  sending their boys off to fight with cheering.
*  But actually, you know, being on the ground in Russia, you can slowly find a different
*  picture emerging.
*  And what is that picture?
*  Starting around Russia the past six months, I've been actually surprised by how many people
*  tell me that they hate this war.
*  Including many who, once they find out I'm a foreigner, usually in hushed tones or quietly,
*  tell me like they really want me to know that most people that they know don't support this
*  war, that not all Russians support this war, that they're ashamed and that they're really
*  sad about what's going on, even if they feel powerless to do something about it.
*  And actually, a recent poll even showed that 20% of Russians openly admit to opposing
*  the war.
*  But Valerie, how should we think about that number?
*  You know, we're not seeing mass protests on the street.
*  The Russian government doesn't really seem to be under that much public pressure to change
*  court in its war in Ukraine.
*  Right, it's a lot of people, but they're not exactly visible.
*  And that's because since the very beginning of the war, the Kremlin has made it very, very
*  dangerous to speak out.
*  As soon as the war started, the Kremlin immediately banned news that wasn't state controlled.
*  You could be arrested for saying the word war or holding it on a poster or writing
*  it in an article.
*  Instead, you're supposed to call it the quote unquote special military operation.
*  But it didn't stop there.
*  There's been a year-long crackdown and it feels like the stakes are constantly rising
*  and the circle of people being targeted is constantly widening.
*  So for me, I've been really wanting to focus on this crackdown and the people who are
*  being swept up in it.
*  Because I actually think that if you look really closely, it tells you something about
*  the nature of the Kremlin's power in Russia.
*  How much it fears that a small group of open dissenters has the potential to grow into
*  a much, much bigger one.
*  So let's talk about those people, Valerie, who are these Russians who are voicing their
*  opposition to the war, despite these really dire repercussions?
*  You know, they're actually all really different people.
*  You might think there's like a profile, but there are sort of middle-aged guys in the provinces,
*  young hip, highly educated college students.
*  There's a lot.
*  One of the cases that really stuck out to me was a teenager named Alicia Kripsova.
*  She lives in a town outside of Archengels, very close to the Arctic Circle.
*  And for our first interview, actually, a colleague of mine went and met her in her home on a
*  windy day in February.
*  I connected over a call on the messaging app Telegram.
*  So Alicia's 19, she's a student at University in Archengelsk studying advertising in public relations.
*  I'm a vegan, I'm a feminist.
*  She's a vegan and a feminist and she's living like a pretty normal life of a young person
*  in Russia at the beginning of 2022.
*  She didn't really consider herself to be an activist.
*  I got the sense that like most university students, she's kind of finding herself and figuring
*  out what she cares about.
*  But when the war in Ukraine started, she thought it was so incredibly senseless that she had
*  to speak out.
*  Like many young Russians, she talked to her family and friends about it and most of them
*  agreed with her that the war was wrong.
*  And she starts doing some quiet acts of protest.
*  A month into the war, she got this pretty intense tattoo of Vladimir Putin's face on the
*  body of a spider with blood dripping down the fangs.
*  It's on her leg and it has a caption that says, big brothers watching you.
*  But at this point, she's not speaking out publicly, right?
*  No, you know, she has her social media channels, which she keeps private.
*  But at a certain point, it became apparent for many Russians that this war was not going
*  to end anytime soon.
*  And last May, she actually decided to do something publicly for the first time.
*  On May 9th, it's when Russia celebrates Victory Day, the end of World War II, and a really
*  important time for Russia's national psyche, and probably one of the biggest national holidays
*  in Russia.
*  The day that in the Kremlin's telling the Soviet Union saved the world from fascism,
*  writes a ring out.
*  But this year, with a war going on in Ukraine, this year the holiday hit her differently.
*  9 May, it made her so angry that Russians are celebrating peace while bombing people in
*  Ukraine.
*  So Alitia made some leaflets with her friends, and the message was, World War II veterans
*  also live in Ukraine, and they are dying from shaling now.
*  This war must end.
*  So what happens?
*  She and her friends make these leaflets.
*  What do they do?
*  Yeryshua, Ryskneitsi.
*  She actually goes around the city putting them up in different houses and residential complexes.
*  And then they all went home.
*  But the next day, the authorities came to her apartment.
*  The scene, the license plate of the car that she and her friend were using as they drove
*  around the city, distributing these things.
*  And who exactly came to her apartment?
*  Like, was it the police?
*  No, they were people from what's called the center, the Russian center for combating
*  extremism.
*  What Alessia refers to as the political police?
*  And she said they forced her to apologize personally to their armed forces of Russia, armed
*  camera.
*  They actually had a video camera with them that she had to talk on.
*  Yes.
*  And when I've seen them around Russia, they always have tiny little handheld cameras.
*  And what happens to her?
*  I mean, did they give her some kind of ticket or warning or something?
*  So because this was her first offense, something that's known as administrative cut in Russian,
*  she was fine.
*  But it will stay on her record.
*  And basically, that comes with a warning of, if you do anything like this again, you will
*  have a criminal trial and the penalties are much higher and include prison time.
*  So this is really, I mean, it's a first warning, but it's a very important first warning,
*  right?
*  Because if you do something a second time, you could face prison.
*  Exactly.
*  And so naturally, she completely scales back her activity.
*  She doesn't go to any protests or do anything else more publicly and limits herself to speaking
*  out on Instagram occasionally and feels pretty safe doing that because her accounts private.
*  But as it turns out, even that was a step too far.
*  And how exactly is posting a private message to Instagram of violation?
*  Well, fast forward a few months to December 26th, she stayed up all night preparing for
*  finals.
*  She finally goes to sleep around 70am and her mom lives for work.
*  And all of a sudden, she hears her voice in her apartment.
*  She thinks maybe it's her grandma checking on her.
*  But it's not.
*  It's actually the Russian authorities, a swarm of men yelling at a lesia to get down on
*  the floor and while she's face down, she looks up and sees a man holding a sledgehammer
*  above her head.
*  And the hammer?
*  Yes, her mind is racing.
*  And she thinks they might actually kill her.
*  But she started trying to think and she thought, okay, maybe there are so many people here
*  that wouldn't just kill me in my own home.
*  And she realized that they were just trying to intimidate her.
*  They take her down to the station eventually and that's when they tell her that she's
*  being investigated, not only for discrediting the Russian armed forces, but also for justifying
*  terrorism.
*  Whoa, so what is that about?
*  There was actually a group of lesia's classmates who had been paying a very close attention
*  to what she was posting on Instagram.
*  And actually had reported her to the authorities for some of her anti-war posts.
*  Basically a group of her friends had snitched on her.
*  Yep.
*  And you know, there was one post in particular that they brought to the attention of the
*  authorities.
*  It was after the Ukrainians bombed a bridge connecting Russia with Crimea.
*  And what she said was, she understood why Ukrainians were rejoicing about it.
*  It's really this post that becomes the center of the allegations against a lesia.
*  And four of her classmates are the key witnesses in the prosecution's case against her in which
*  she faces a prison sentence of up to 10 years.
*  10 years.
*  Did you talk to the students who turned her in?
*  Well, I tried to.
*  There was this group chat in which some of the students were discussing whether or not
*  they would denounce a lesia.
*  And I actually saw some of the screenshots.
*  And one of the students at one point during this debate says, denunciation is the duty of
*  a patriot.
*  Whoa.
*  And I actually got his phone number and I tried to call him.
*  Hello.
*  Hello.
*  And he answered the phone, but as soon as I identified myself as a journalist and told him
*  I was writing about this case, he hung up.
*  But then I went to a lesia's university.
*  I wanted to see what other students thought about this case.
*  And I wanted to see what kind of effect it had on the campus.
*  So I went to the university with a photographer colleague and we split up.
*  And I started introducing myself to some students and it was a little bit strange.
*  Some people were just automatically hesitant to talk.
*  Some people just kept saying they had no idea about the case that they'd never heard of
*  it, that they didn't know what I was talking about.
*  And at first I thought, how do they not know?
*  And I came away with the impression that on a campus of this size, it would be pretty
*  impossible not to know about it.
*  And that showed me the extent of the chilling effect that this had on the student body.
*  And then all of a sudden I got a message from my colleague who wrote to me that she
*  saw someone following us probably from the FSB, the Russian Intelligence and Security Agency.
*  But someone following you?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, this happens when you travel in the Russian regions, but it's always a bit nerve
*  cracking because you don't know what consequences it has on the people that you're talking to.
*  I really want to make sure that no one I talk to gets harmed because they talk to me.
*  So once I knew I was being followed, I said goodbye and realized that my chances of getting
*  more students to talk were pretty slim.
*  But eventually I was able to talk to the head of Olesia's department at the university.
*  He's 42 years old and he's in favor of the government and in favor of the war.
*  He actually wrote a negative character reference for the prosecution even though Olesia said
*  she's never met him.
*  Oh wow, so he's part of the case sort of in a way.
*  Yes.
*  And what do you tell you?
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  What was the question?
*  So I asked him what he thought about Olesia and what he thought of the case, especially
*  you know, at an academic institution where students should be free to debate things.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  What's the rank?
*  He said that he thought there should be limits to the kind of debate students could have.
*  And mostly he described Olesia as having been ideologically hypnotized,
*  meaning that like she had been exposed to too much dangerous sort of Western propaganda,
*  films, movies.
*  He actually said that in wartime, you know, soft power like that can be weaponized and is
*  dangerous and that Western culture should be restricted in Russia.
*  So he was saying basically that Olesia had been brainwashed, brainwashed by Westernness.
*  Yeah.
*  And he also said that the informers, you know, the students that turned her in.
*  He referred to them as part of a healthy immune response to a wound or a disease in society.
*  He basically compared Olesia's public distaste for the war to a bacteria or an infection.
*  And he said these students were part of the organism of a healthy immune system of a society
*  that were actually, you know, making sure that the society didn't get more sick.
*  To prevent contagion.
*  Exactly.
*  He said the system worked exactly as it was supposed to.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Valerie, where did Olesia's case stand when you interviewed her back in February?
*  When I first talked to her, she wasn't her house arrest awaiting trial.
*  She had to wear an ankle bracelet that tracked her location.
*  It was right across her other leg from her Putin tattoo.
*  And she wasn't allowed to use any technology.
*  So she felt super alone.
*  And she said that in general, she was really scared.
*  And that every night before she would go to bed, she and her mom would hug and say goodbye.
*  Because they kind of never knew what would happen the next day.
*  So she really could be taken away at any minute.
*  Right. And I mean, she had to go to court hearings every month.
*  And she was hoping that they would let her defend herself.
*  But she knew that they could also just actually put her in jail immediately.
*  So she kept a packed bag at all times that she would take.
*  And what are those court hearings like?
*  Well, a few days after I talked to her the first time.
*  I actually traveled to our homegirls to attend one of those hearings.
*  Because I thought it would be probably my only chance to really talk with Olesia in person and see her.
*  And we were brought into a pretty small court room, a big cage where the defendants normally sit,
*  takes up half the room.
*  So she was there.
*  And Olesia was there and seeing her really underscored to me how young she is.
*  She was wearing a butterfly headband and a long skirt.
*  She's quite petite.
*  And we were waiting for the proceedings to start when something kind of unexpected happened.
*  A Russian TV crew approached me and started asking me repeatedly, rapid-fire.
*  What was I doing there?
*  Why was I interested in the case?
*  What do you think about the war in Ukraine?
*  Do you support Western weapons being used against Russian soldiers?
*  I was pretty shocked, I have to say, and I was stunned.
*  And my heart was beating pretty fast.
*  But I told them that I was just doing my job like they should be.
*  Wait, were they there to cover the Olesia case or were they there to talk to you?
*  Like why were they asking these questions?
*  I don't actually think they were there to cover Olesia's trial because
*  they didn't ask her any questions when she spoke to the press ahead of the trial.
*  And they also left almost as soon as it started.
*  Oh wow.
*  So it was kind of hard to tell what they were up to exactly, but the hearing itself
*  was relatively uneventful.
*  And in the end, the judge decided to leave Olesia under house arrest.
*  But then later that night, I realized why the television crew was interviewing me.
*  The exchange I had with the Russian TV reporters was part of a segment on the local news
*  about foreign interest in Olesia's case.
*  So you were on television?
*  Yes.
*  And they presented us this like boring, bog-standard procedural case,
*  and not like a teenager on terrorism charges for an Instagram story on our private account.
*  Olesia Kripsova, who is under arrest in criminal crimes,
*  decided to leave under house arrest.
*  So at this point, your reporting on Olesia is really starting to come under the same kind of scrutiny
*  as the dissent itself, right?
*  Well, it's certainly coming under scrutiny.
*  You know, it drove home to me the idea that actually, you know, the Kremlin is so focused on this,
*  that it's not just the dissenters themselves, but also the people covering them,
*  and sending their message out into the world.
*  Because inside Russia right now, it's very hard to get information about these dissenters.
*  And the international media are actually one of the few groups of people left able to report on it.
*  So what's next for Olesia? When does she go to trial?
*  Well, I stayed in touch quite frequently with her mom because Olesia's not allowed to use technology.
*  And then all of a sudden, one day last month, her mother called to tell me that she had some pretty major news.
*  Olesia had managed to escape Russia and made it to Vilnius, Lithuania.
*  Wow.
*  She was ecstatic.
*  Yeah, pretty weird.
*  So what would that be?
*  And so when I was finally able to speak to Olesia directly a few days later from Lithuania,
*  she told me a little bit about what happened.
*  She said that there's this secret network of activists who help to spirit people out.
*  It's really underground.
*  She had to completely disguise herself into a different person.
*  She was wearing a man's big ugly coat.
*  It's a good thing to have a good mood.
*  It's a good thing to have a good mood.
*  And there was a sort of hopeful tone to our call.
*  You know, we were talking, she was actually walking around in Vilnius.
*  She was staying in like a group apartment where people were sleeping.
*  You could hear the birds chirping.
*  Spring had arrived also for her and she's walking around taking in her surroundings and,
*  you know, seeing just this Ukrainian flags hanging everywhere in Vilnius.
*  And also LGBTQ, rainbow flags.
*  Very different from Russia.
*  Yes, that's all banned in Russia.
*  What did she tell you?
*  Like why did she decide to leave?
*  Well, she told me that at first she felt really determined to stay and fight.
*  But she said she realized that at these court hearings that would essentially decide her entire
*  future and her fate. Nobody was actually listening to her. Nobody was taking her seriously.
*  She realized that nothing she could say would change anything.
*  And she decided to leave because she became desperate.
*  She said that she knew it would be really painful.
*  Her grandmother was old and sick and she knew that by leaving,
*  she actually might never see her again.
*  And considering that Alicia is not going to spend the next 10 years in Russian penal colony,
*  she's got off pretty well, you know.
*  But even a best-case scenario in this case means losing your home country, your home,
*  your family, your mom, you know, the life you are building for yourself.
*  But she also said that the real heroes are the people who stayed behind
*  no matter the consequences.
*  So, Alicia's story is the story of someone who resisted,
*  but who ultimately fled.
*  Right? But whether she goes to prison or flees the country,
*  in both cases, it's ultimately a win for Putin,
*  because it's one less voice of dissent.
*  Like he's trying to cleanse the country of anybody who has the potential for political opposition.
*  What about the people, Alicia's calling the real heroes, the people who don't escape and go to prison?
*  What about them?
*  The government has detained more than 20,000 Russians since the start of the war.
*  And I've reported on a few of those cases.
*  I remember one sentencing that I went to about a month ago that really stuck with me
*  of a man named Dima or Dimitri Ivanov.
*  On the surface, his case is a lot like Alicia's.
*  He's also a student, he's 23.
*  And his crime was actually reposting information from Western media about the killings in the
*  Ukrainian cities of Bucha and Mariuple.
*  And Supreme, it's actually really fascinating now that these trials for anti-war activists are
*  one of the few places that like-minded people can actually gather in public and show their
*  opposition to the war. So many people come in support. I think at Dima sentencing,
*  there was probably about 100 people.
*  And they do this even though the court keeps track of who appears as a spectator.
*  I'm a friend of the Dalis, I'm a friend of the Luglan.
*  It's customary in a Russian courtroom for the accused to say a final word, a statement,
*  you know, before the sentencing.
*  I don't know what the truth is.
*  He said, we can't stop the war right now, but that doesn't mean that we're powerless.
*  I want each of you to think about what they can do personally.
*  Our problem is our inability to take the initiative and find like-minded people.
*  We're used to following leaders in the waiting for orders.
*  Don't wait.
*  Act. Become volunteers. Help refugees. Support political prisoners.
*  Form horizontal ties. Meet your neighbors, colleagues and classmates. Set common goals.
*  And achieve them together. Don't walk by when someone needs your help.
*  We love to repeat the words,
*  but Russia will be free.
*  But Russia is our country.
*  Then he continued, we like to repeat the words, Russia will be free like a mantra.
*  But Russia is us and what it will be depends on us only.
*  Russia will be free because we will make it that way.
*  And right after the speech, the judge delivered the sentence, eight and a half years in prison.
*  She asked him, do you understand the sentence?
*  He said he did. And then the guards led him away.
*  So, Valerie, going back to the beginning of our conversation, you know, why the Kremlin is so afraid of
*  resistors like Dima and Alicia, it's essentially because they're showing a path forward for Russians
*  who disagree with the war, but until now have been too afraid to act on that.
*  Like that 20% we were talking about.
*  Dima is essentially saying here, you don't need to go to jail, but you do need to act.
*  Do something small, meet people, talk, and that is very threatening to the state because the
*  Kremlin knows that that kind of thing is contagious. Like the director of Adelaise's university said,
*  if it's left unchecked, it can spread.
*  Yeah, for the Kremlin and for Putin especially, you know, it's existential for them to maintain
*  the image that they do have broad support, that the war has broad support.
*  And they are doing more and more to try to force everyone to get in line,
*  or at least not do anything that would pierce that image.
*  And if this war is going to end, there's a very high chance that it will come from people
*  like this. And that's something Dima knows. And that's something the Kremlin also knows.
*  I think it's what Putin fears the most.
*  So Valerie, I think now is a good time to bring this up.
*  Two weeks ago, after this sentencing, I got a text from you.
*  You sent me a link to a news article about a Wall Street Journal reporter, Evan Gershkovich.
*  He'd just been arrested in the Russian city of Katerina Burk. He was accused of spying.
*  And it was the first time since the Cold War,
*  an American journalist had been arrested and charged like this.
*  I'm looking at your text. You said, this is very, very bad.
*  And then you said, I'm on my way to the airport.
*  That's true. It's really painful.
*  Evan and I were good friends in Russia.
*  So his arrest came as a complete shock.
*  I left Russia some hours after the charges were announced.
*  And so did some other Western reporters.
*  And that just means there'll be fewer people paying attention to the trials of political prisoners
*  like Dima, and listening to him give his last word.
*  And fewer people really trying to understand how ordinary Russians feel about how their country is changing.
*  And in this way, Russia becomes even less knowable, even more difficult to penetrate and understand.
*  Exactly.
*  Valerie, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what I'll teach you today.
*  A mass shooting at a bank in Louisville, Kentucky, Monday morning left four employees dead
*  and nine people wounded.
*  This is awful. I have a very close friend that didn't make it today.
*  Kentucky governor Andy Beshear said he knew several of the victims.
*  And I have another close friend who didn't either.
*  And one who's at the hospital that I hope is going to make it through.
*  The gunman, a 23-year-old employee of the bank, was killed by police.
*  And in Nashville, the City Council on Monday voted unanimously
*  to return Democratic lawmaker Justin Jones to the state house.
*  Voters in district 52 elected Justin Jones to be their voice at the state house.
*  And that voice was taken away this past week.
*  So let's give them their voice back.
*  The move comes four days after Jones and fellow Democrat Justin Pearson
*  were expelled for leading a gun control protest from the floor of the house.
*  Go to ran Mr. Park, close machines, take the vote.
*  Within an hour, Jones was sworn in and back at his seat
*  in the Republican controlled legislature that had voted him out.
