*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Babaro.
*  This is Adioli.
*  The ouster of house speaker Kevin McCarthy a few days ago has demonstrated just how powerful
*  a small group of hard-right house Republicans have become.
*  How far they will go in the name of ideology and just how deep their grievances run.
*  Today a conversation with one of the eight Republicans who brought McCarthy down.
*  Congressman Tim Burchett of Tennessee.
*  It's Friday October 6th.
*  Congressman?
*  Congressman?
*  Oh, Congressman, you are muted on your side of this.
*  Oh wait, let me take that off.
*  There we go.
*  You all hear me?
*  I can.
*  Hello, Congressman.
*  Hey, it's Tim.
*  I don't believe I'm allowed to call you anything other than Congressman.
*  I can call me Tim, too.
*  And so I tell the custodians up here call me Tim because they are the only ones up here
*  working.
*  I believe you're working today.
*  Yes, well, talking to you guys.
*  So I really want to thank you for making time for us.
*  Yes, sir.
*  It is, I think, no understatement to say, been a heck of a week in your world.
*  It's a heck of a day, heck of a day.
*  And I had to make a tough decision and I made it.
*  Makes me wonder, are people in the Republican caucus in the house, are they talking to
*  you right now or are you something of a pariah?
*  I've always been something of a pariah, brother.
*  I didn't come to Washington to make friends.
*  Well, as I think we're hinting at here, you're one of the eight House Republicans who
*  made a very momentous decision.
*  And that decision was to vote to oust your leader, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.
*  First time that has happened in United States history.
*  And I wonder how much that history, Congressman, weighed on you in the period leading up to
*  the actual vote.
*  I tell you what, weighed on me is just doing the right thing.
*  If I could go over the, my thought process to where I got to where I voted for that.
*  That'd be okay.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I want to, I want to make sure people understand what a journey it's been for you.
*  Because you started off as a firm supporter of Speaker McCarthy.
*  You were somebody who voted for him at 15 times.
*  15 times during that now agonizing process.
*  And, and you weren't one of those conservative House Republicans who refused or said, I'm
*  going to vote present.
*  You were a formal definitive, yes, over and over again, back in January.
*  And yes, the reason I do want you to explain your thinking and your journey is, is it
*  I think if we can understand your disillusionment with Speaker McCarthy over these last nine
*  months, we can better understand the larger story of what has happened here.
*  So tell us how you got from there supporting McCarthy to here deciding he could no longer
*  be Speaker.
*  Yes.
*  Well, during that time, if you've seen a lot of the pictures, I set aside a lot of the
*  holdouts and I met with them because I was, you know, I'm a conservative.
*  I'm just not angry about it.
*  And I met with them several times during that and I talked to them about things I thought
*  were important and they agreed.
*  And I went to Speaker McCarthy early on and I said, these are some things I wanted.
*  And he gave me about a assurance of about 85% of what I was interested in would happen.
*  I wanted a fiscal note.
*  I wanted something to say how much something cost.
*  I remembered one time I asked it, then our ranking member now, our chair of appropriations
*  just how much money does this piece of legislation cost?
*  And she looked at me and said, I don't know.
*  Next question.
*  And I said, no.
*  You know, and later, oh, you can't question her.
*  You can't do that.
*  You know, and then I never did find out how much that piece of legislation costs.
*  So that was something I asked the Speaker about.
*  And they said they would work.
*  You said, I should be able to know exactly what the price tag is on a piece of legislation.
*  That was one of your conditions.
*  Yeah.
*  Absolutely.
*  I don't think that's unusual at all.
*  I don't walk into the supermarket and just trust the cashier to, you know, to charge
*  me whatever they think it costs.
*  Can you just explain why these questions around fiscal transparency, why they're so important
*  to you and why they seem to be your primary overriding concern as a member of Congress?
*  And why do you think they're so important for the people you represent in Tennessee?
*  I had the very good fortune of having parents that were a good deal older than most of my
*  buddies, parents.
*  My brother and sister and I were both all three of us born very late in their lives.
*  And my parents grew up in the Depression.
*  And Daddy told me a story one time.
*  And I always remembered it.
*  He said he watched these kids and they were laughing.
*  And he said, he watched this and they ate an apple and they threw the apple core in the
*  trash can.
*  And some kid came by and dug through the trash and ate that apple core.
*  And as a young man that made a huge impression on my daddy.
*  This child's need and perhaps poverty.
*  And poverty and because of irresponsibility and greed and things like that, America was
*  thrust into a depression.
*  I think about that and I think about the average American, you know, you get single moms
*  in my district working two jobs, got three kids and we are just throwing money away on all
*  this stuff overseas everywhere and not focusing on keeping our debt down and keeping inflation
*  down.
*  So I just want to make sure I say it sounds like you're saying that the reason you care
*  about this issue and the reason you believe your constituents care about it is a fear that
*  government mismanagement of our nation's finances could lead to just a truly awful outcome.
*  Whether it's something like the Great Depression of 1929 or just kind of garden variety problems
*  in people's financial life.
*  Not could, but 100% will.
*  Because nowadays this world depends more on America's economy and it would be a worldwide
*  depression.
*  It would be a complete evaluation of currency.
*  Inflation would be rampant.
*  It'd be like we do, you know, pre-World War II Europe where you see the people pushing
*  the wheelbarrow down the street full of cash trying to buy a loaf of bread.
*  I mean, you you surely know this, right?
*  That there's a lot of debate about the causes of.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  Anyone financial crisis 1929 wasn't necessarily about government spending, but you seem quite
*  convinced that too much government spending and not enough accountability around that
*  spending, not enough transparency around it is a problem.
*  100%.
*  We are out of control and we have no fiscal barometer at all.
*  Well, what did you just kind of brass tax expect this speaker that you voted for in January
*  to be able to do about that knowing as you do that Republicans had such a slim majority
*  and that the next chamber, the Senate is controlled by Democrats and the White House
*  is controlled by a Democrat.
*  What did you reasonably expect given what he told you, but given what's also possible
*  that he could do about these questions of transparency and spending?
*  I expected leadership.
*  I expected somebody to take our ideas and our values to the White House, to the Senate,
*  and let's meet, let's talk about it.
*  But you're not going to get that way by issuing a press release into this.
*  I'm not going to meet with the press and I'm not going to meet with Chuck Schumer.
*  You were disappointed when he was not engaging in more vigorous negotiations with the Senate
*  leader or the president.
*  That was to you a dereliction.
*  Completely.
*  But there again, we got a real problem in this country and we better start addressing it.
*  That's why I reach out.
*  I'm friends Josh Gotttenheimer from Jersey.
*  I work with those folks.
*  I talk to them about issues, things we're doing.
*  Democrats?
*  Yes, sir.
*  Honestly, dude, we got a dead-gum country to run, man.
*  This is ridiculous.
*  Maybe it sells memberships, demonized in the other party or demonized in somebody, but
*  it's a realality as we need to produce and get to work.
*  I want to keep pushing on this because there is a point at which Speaker McCarthy does
*  sit down and negotiate with Democrats and with the president and it feels like when
*  he does.
*  That's around these issues.
*  There are always moments where spending is on the table.
*  You lose faith in Speaker McCarthy.
*  I want to talk about those moments and let's start with the death ceiling.
*  We continue to raise the death ceiling every year and you can argue with that's just
*  a grand to pay what we owed.
*  To me, that just sets yourself up for more economic failure, more spending.
*  What did you want Speaker McCarthy to do in that negotiation?
*  Reduce the death ceiling, take our views and our values to the table and they did not.
*  Do you believe that Speaker McCarthy never brought your perspective to the negotiation table
*  or just ultimately couldn't prevail in getting enough folks to support it?
*  I just want to understand that distinction.
*  I don't know.
*  I just know that my views weren't being represented and whoever had his ear, they were.
*  I remember I had a meeting with his lieutenant because I was a holdout and the press was like,
*  you still know, yep, I'm going to meet with him though.
*  Great.
*  Then a couple days before the vote, they set up a meeting.
*  I go to this meeting and I wait and I wait and I wait.
*  I waited 20 or 30 minutes and they didn't show up.
*  No meeting.
*  The press is waiting for me outside here and I walk out and it was very embarrassing to
*  me.
*  You were basically kind of dist.
*  Disrespect.
*  I get that.
*  I'm the 435 most powerful member of Congress and there's only 435 of us.
*  That's my number on the baseball team by the way.
*  You start with the process.
*  How great I am.
*  They really need me on board and need you to help me and I said, no, I'm not.
*  Then they go to belittling.
*  They thought they're just going to roll me.
*  They're just taking me to the woodsheds, not going to work.
*  I don't care.
*  I just said, I'm not with you and I walked out and that was it.
*  I'm going to vote my conscience and that's what I did.
*  We're going to continue down this path of right away spending until we call it in the
*  check and we repeatedly refuse to do that.
*  Well, you started to get it.
*  You voted against that deal, a deal that won many more Democratic votes than Republican
*  to avert a US government default by raising the debt ceiling back in the summer.
*  I'm here in you say that a default wouldn't be catastrophic.
*  To many others, the analysis was that it was going to be catastrophic.
*  I just want to be sure I understand.
*  It's always catastrophic when you're in the opposition always makes it catastrophic.
*  We'll never get our fiscal ship in order.
*  We'll never get it straight now and we just continue down this path of spending.
*  I'm not going to be a part of it.
*  Was there a part of you that in any way wanted to see, and I don't want this phrasing to
*  get too loaded, but wanted the situation to arise where perhaps the country did go into
*  a potential default because it would then allow you to make this question of fiscal responsibility,
*  including cuts, transparency, more pressing and prominent to people that was going to give
*  you and those like-minded, more leverage.
*  You mean what I've tried to cause it to prove my point?
*  Yeah, that is what I'm asking.
*  No, no, I wouldn't do that.
*  That's a gutless thing to do.
*  I just vote my conscience.
*  I didn't do my votes on fiscal issues did not put us in this position.
*  Yet I'm required to follow my sword to correct it when it will never correct if we just
*  keep spending.
*  You know, it's the chicken of the egg.
*  So this addiction needs to be broken regardless.
*  Somebody's going to have to take tough stands.
*  Somebody's got to draw attention to it.
*  Yet nobody is.
*  But in the end, Congressman, the deal that McCarthy signed around the debt limit ends up being
*  a deal that you don't like because you and a few other conservative House Republicans
*  won't sign on to it.
*  Therefore he feels he has no choice but to work with Democrats to get a deal that by definition
*  you're going to like even less than the one you were negotiating before.
*  Yeah, I know where you're headed with that.
*  And I actually asked leadership if I've done every time to get the people that are opposed
*  to it in a room and let's talk about it.
*  And they never do.
*  They want to jam us up against a wall and make us look bad in the public's eye and thinking
*  we'll yield.
*  And to me, that just creates animosity.
*  You know, everybody up here, they fuss at you and cuss at you and drop F bombs on you
*  and say things when you walk by and do thing.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know, and you got bullies in there that get in your face.
*  They act real tough.
*  I always like to say they're the type of guy that they're a kid through a rock over the
*  fence and then ran home and hit behind their mama skirt.
*  Because when leadership doesn't call them down, they are endorsing that type of behavior.
*  And so to me, that does not show leadership.
*  That shows cowardice and it's very childish behavior.
*  And I don't like that type of leadership.
*  I would like for them to get with us in the beginning unless work our differences out.
*  But they chose not to do that.
*  And yeah, I'm hearing you say you're feeling marginalized, which is kind of interesting
*  because you all, there aren't that many of you.
*  Everyone understands the power of your block of votes, whether it's the five or eight
*  or 10 or 15 of you who can be so influential in this moment.
*  And I'm hearing you say that you guys are not being drawn into the process in a way that
*  makes you feel respected by Speaker McCarthy.
*  We're not being drawn in the process at all until the end.
*  And then they say we're not willing to work with them.
*  Do you think that, do you think that Speaker McCarthy concluded somewhere along the way
*  that it's just kind of futile to do that because he knows what you all stand for?
*  Because he know the terms upon which you want to negotiate.
*  Well, that's hard to say because we never did meet with us.
*  I think this brings us, if we're kind of sticking with a chronology here, to this second
*  big moment that I believe upset you and tested your faith in Speaker McCarthy, which is
*  the potential government shutdown last week.
*  And the dynamics there were very much the same as they were with the debt ceiling and
*  the potential default on US debt.
*  You did not like the deal that was being offered within the Republican caucus, which then
*  prompted Speaker McCarthy to work with Democrats to pass a spending bill that would prevent
*  the government from shutting down.
*  Does that feel like an accurate description?
*  No, well, we were not offered the opportunity to work with Speaker McCarthy again, again.
*  But once again, I think to the lay listener may sound a little bit like you're so frustrated
*  at being sidelined that you're willing to let the government shut down.
*  Well, I'm worried about the pain that that would cause.
*  And I say, this is all sincerity.
*  But I tell you what I'm more worried about is the inflation and the lack of purchase
*  power that these people are going to get, the single moms and the teachers and people
*  that bust their hump every day, fireman, policemen.
*  As a result of what?
*  Of government spending?
*  Government spending and our economy, crashing.
*  And it's just, when you take in $5 trillion a year and you spend $7 trillion, I mean,
*  eventually you got to realize that that's deflating the value of American currency.
*  There's no other way around it.
*  I just want to be sure.
*  I'm just making sure to clarify these things.
*  A government shutdown like a default has consequences.
*  Those consequences are soldiers aren't paid law enforcement, federal law enforcement,
*  but you're saying it's more important?
*  They will all get paid.
*  They will all be reimbursed as they always are.
*  They do a lot of this to scare people.
*  Both parties do it.
*  Block up the monuments so the veterans can't get to them.
*  Things that are going to cause maximum pain and maximum exposure.
*  But if we enter into a depression, I dare say those people, there's the good faith and
*  will of this country are not going to be able to take care of these people.
*  You're saying something that I think is important to understand, which is that as with the potential
*  default, a potential government shutdown is not going to cause the big trauma.
*  And your mind, the big economic financial trauma is not changing government spending patterns
*  and your parlance addiction, which creates the real long-term economic hardships.
*  Yes, sir, because we're not doing it.
*  It's institutional and we're not doing anything to fix it.
*  All the stuff we're doing now is just making it worse.
*  I do see a bit of a pattern here and I want to run it by you and get your read on it.
*  It feels like this is what's happening in both of these cases of the default and the
*  potential shutdown.
*  You and some of your colleagues by being maybe you would present this word,
*  obstinate, unyielding, whatever it is.
*  You force the government into a tricky position.
*  I know you don't think that those positions are as traumatic as if other people do, but
*  obviously Speaker McCarthy did.
*  And he worries so much that he feels he has no choice but to work with the Democrats
*  to prevent those crises.
*  But here's my really important question.
*  In a sense, haven't you engineered the entire situation by being so unwilling to take
*  anything less than what you want?
*  Speaker McCarthy is major concern is staying in power.
*  We had a conversation a few weeks ago and on Saturday and the last thing he said to
*  me was, I really want to be the speaker.
*  And to me that, that typified pretty much everything.
*  What do we got that will get the votes?
*  What are we principled?
*  What are we going to fight for?
*  And that to me is not leadership.
*  That is just a barometer.
*  You stick your finger up in the air, figure out which of the winds blowing.
*  And then you jump out in front of it and take credit for it.
*  That is not leadership.
*  That is nothing to rally around.
*  And the difference is between him and Pelosi, you know, and I catch a lot of hell for saying
*  this, but she was an effective leader and she would get an issue, put a stake in the ground
*  and call people in and say, this is where I'm at, where are you?
*  And then when she put her proposal out, it would win.
*  And that was because of that style of leadership.
*  And that is something we're not doing.
*  But we know that Speaker McCarthy was willing to give up this job he loved in the end because
*  he did.
*  And so I do want to ask this question again.
*  And he didn't have any choice.
*  Hey, I mean, he was gone.
*  There was no.
*  Totally understand.
*  But just, just hear me out on this.
*  In the end, in these scenarios, is it accurate or not that you and a few of your colleagues,
*  given your crucial role, given the numbers, engineer these situations that end with the
*  Speaker feeling like his only choice is to work with Democrats.
*  Now I hear what you're saying and I hear that a lot.
*  And I think his problem was his refusal to work with his own members.
*  He did.
*  Just didn't meet with us.
*  Fifteen of us.
*  Get us in a room.
*  Find out the differences.
*  I think that would have been a wise approach.
*  We'll do it back.
*  So for all these reasons that you've clearly described, you have lost your faith in Speaker
*  McCarthy by the beginning of this week.
*  And then your colleague, Representative Matt Gates, files this motion to try to remove
*  him as Speaker.
*  I'm curious.
*  Did you end up speaking to McCarthy before that vote?
*  And did he appeal to you in any way that let you air out all these grievances and all
*  these feelings of being slated and not heard out?
*  Did you guys talk about it?
*  Well, he called me.
*  I was on CNN.
*  I think I'm one of the few Republicans that goes on CNN on a regular basis.
*  And I said, I prayed about it.
*  And I asked God to show me what I needed to be doing.
*  And he called me that morning.
*  And his opening salvo to me, I felt was very condescending.
*  What did he say?
*  Well, I'll just mention something about my prayer.
*  And then he since come back and say he didn't say it.
*  That's not the way he minute or whatever, but it doesn't matter.
*  You were not pleased with the way he framed your prayers.
*  Yeah.
*  So he follows up.
*  I said something I think about term limits.
*  And where are we on term limits?
*  Can I just make sure I understand that term limits are important to you.
*  Those are important to me, but they're important to the American public.
*  It pulls through the roof.
*  And they said, well, it died in committee.
*  And then I said, we took six weeks off.
*  We usually just take the month of August off.
*  When we took off two weeks in September, I said, why'd you all send us home?
*  I don't set the schedule.
*  You know, Dad Gammett, he's speaker.
*  You think if Pelosi wanted us to be here over the weekend, we'd be over the weekend,
*  I dare say we would.
*  So this is another in your mind failure of leadership.
*  Complete.
*  He is the speaker of the house, one of the most powerful positions, not in Washington,
*  not in the country, but in the dead gum world.
*  To say that he can't say anything to the schedule.
*  He doesn't get bills in committee.
*  To me is not acceptable.
*  And so I wasn't getting anywhere.
*  And that was it.
*  And I thought God was telling me, maybe not an audible voice, but in my gut or my conscience,
*  he was saying, vote your conscience, because that's what served me very well these last
*  few years that I've been in office.
*  And that's the way I voted.
*  And I voted that way.
*  I wonder, Carson, if you think the other seven who voted the same way you did had similar
*  reasons and similar experiences with the speaker.
*  I think style of leadership is a big thing.
*  I think fiscal responsibilities are a big thing.
*  And we just had enough.
*  We just had enough.
*  And so it was time to make a stand and we did.
*  I want to take you back to the moments after Speaker McCarthy was ousted.
*  He gave a news conference.
*  I don't know much of it you watched.
*  I watched all of it.
*  And he basically said that in his mind, the eight of you who voted to oust him have now
*  created an impossible situation for the next speaker.
*  And when he said before that there needs to be an adult in the room, I think he meant
*  something very particular about the ability to keep government open, avoid a default, negotiate,
*  and sometimes reach deals that are not the best, but they're good enough.
*  What did you hear him say when he said that?
*  I didn't listen to it, but from what you said, I would assume that, you know, the adult
*  in the room is going to be somebody that tells the truth, doesn't pit people against others.
*  And that's not what we have.
*  I took it to me in that in Congress and then divided government, you have to compromise.
*  I don't compromise my values.
*  If I gave my word, I give my word.
*  I don't represent the lobbyist up here.
*  I represent a lot of hardworking folks back in East Tennessee.
*  And then, you know, into them, I'm their hope, I think.
*  And that's why I keep getting elected and the big boys just failed to understand that.
*  Can you describe from me, Congressman, what you want in the next speaker?
*  Because there is a sense you've made clear that Speaker McCarthy told a lot of different
*  people what they wanted to hear and then didn't live up to those commitments.
*  And that makes me wonder if you'd support a candidate for speaker who said to you,
*  Congressman Berger, let me be straight with you, I can't do the things that you want in
*  this area and this area and this area.
*  I know they're important, but I can't do them given the math of this Congress.
*  So just know that at front, will you support me anyway?
*  Because somebody straight up with me, I can handle that a lot easier.
*  I want a strong leader though.
*  You know, when Daddy was in the Pacific, his colonel, when a little island called
*  Pell, it was a guy named Chesty Pullard, but Daddy, you know, he said they'd turn
*  around on Pell, who, and Hill, they'd be colonel pullers right there with them, fighting
*  it out. That's the kind of leader I look for.
*  I look for somebody like a colonel puller, like my father.
*  You're getting the trenches with you and who would, who would meet with you,
*  not set up some appointment that you got to go to the Capitol and you wait outside,
*  you wait, you wait, you wait.
*  And if there's some compromise involved in that, then maybe.
*  So integrity is the question at hand.
*  I think so. I think so.
*  I think that because of the vote you cast, the next few weeks are going to be
*  very confusing and uncertain in Washington.
*  For all kinds of procedural reasons, the house is going to not be able to do certain
*  things because there's not a speaker, including passing spending bills.
*  Does that bother you?
*  We'll be back to work, Tuesday, and we will elect a speaker on Wednesday.
*  I'm confident we'll have one ballot on the floor, and I believe that will pass.
*  So this is not a moment you're worried is going to drag out for some time.
*  I don't think it will.
*  Just to end this conversation, Congressman, let's say this new speaker who you are
*  amenable to and who has the integrity you need for him or her to possess gets the job.
*  There's still a mathematical problem at the heart of what you and this small group
*  of Republicans represent.
*  You want something that many other of your colleagues don't want and many
*  Democrats don't want.
*  And so let's say you get that speaker, the one you like.
*  Are you truly going to be willing to compromise on some of these questions we've
*  been talking about so that you're not right back where we were at the beginning of
*  this conversation?
*  If I feel like that speaker worked with me in good faith, then you'll compromise.
*  It depends on spending on fiscal matters.
*  It depends.
*  I'm not going to deft suspending.
*  There's no compromise there.
*  There is no compromise there.
*  There is no more money.
*  You can't spend money.
*  You don't have.
*  We can't just keep printing money.
*  So that does mean we might be back where we started.
*  If we're not going to be fiscally responsible, but I think this next speaker will
*  understand that role.
*  And if they don't, will you vote again to potentially oust another speaker?
*  I vote my conscience.
*  I don't think we're going to make that mistake again.
*  Well, Congressman Birchett, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate your time.
*  It's been a pleasure, brother.
*  Thank you.
*  Bear questions.
*  It's been a pleasure for me as well, brother.
*  Thank you.
*  After we spoke with Congressman Birchett, we reached out to the office of former
*  speaker McCarthy for common.
*  There was no response.
*  So far, at least two House Republicans say they will seek to replace McCarthy as
*  speaker representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House Republican majority
*  leader and representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, an outspoken ally of former
*  president Trump.
*  House Republicans are expected to pick their next leader as early as Wednesday.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Thursday, a federal court ordered Alabama to use a new congressional map for
*  next year's election that could leave the state to elect two black representatives for
*  the first time in its history and allow Democrats to pick up another House seat in what is
*  expected to be a closely fought battle for control of Congress.
*  The order is the culmination of a two year fight over an effort by Alabama's Republican
*  lawmakers to dilute the power of black voters in order to consolidate Republican power.
*  That effort has been deemed illegal by several federal courts, including the U.S.
*  Supreme Court.
*  And in north eastern Ukraine, dozens of people were killed when a Russian rocket hit a
*  village shop where people had gathered for a funeral.
*  It appeared to be one of the deadliest attacks on civilians since the war began.
*  Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, condemned the attack as a deliberate act of
*  terrorism and a quote demonstrably brutal Russian crime.
