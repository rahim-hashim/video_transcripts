# The New Abortion Fight Before the Supreme Court
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VSyyB7OXKk)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  As the presidential race moves into high gear, abortion is at the center of it.
*  Republican-controlled states continue to impose new bans, including just this week in Florida.
*  But in Washington, the Biden administration is fighting back, challenging one of those
*  bans in a case that is now before the Supreme Court.
*  Today, my colleagues Pam Bellic and Abby Van Sickle explain.
*  It's Wednesday, May 1st.
*  So Pam, in the two years since Roe v. Wade was overturned, more than a dozen states have
*  instituted pretty strict bans.
*  But as all of these bans are happening at the state level, something is happening at
*  the federal level.
*  And that is the Biden administration is fighting back in a kind of unusual way.
*  And that effort came to the Supreme Court last week.
*  Tell me about it.
*  Yeah, so the case that went before the Supreme Court last week is basically a fight between
*  the state of Idaho and the Biden administration over whether Idaho's abortion ban violates
*  a federal law that's been on the books for decades.
*  And if it does, then does Idaho have to change its abortion ban?
*  This case really gets at a bigger question about whether there are still ways that the
*  federal government can limit states' ability to ban or restrict abortion.
*  Dobbs eliminated the constitutional right to abortion.
*  It said that there's no guarantee anywhere in the country that people have a right to
*  abortion access and that states can make their own laws around abortion.
*  It didn't completely eliminate any other way that federal government laws or regulations
*  interact with abortion.
*  Right.
*  So that left the Biden administration looking around to try to figure out what, if anything,
*  the federal government could do to weigh in on abortion.
*  It turned out that there were really very few tools left to the federal government,
*  but it does find this one federal law from 40 years ago.
*  And the law really has nothing to do with abortion.
*  It doesn't mention abortion.
*  It is all about emergency room medical care.
*  But the Biden administration thinks that it has found a way to use this law to fight
*  some of the strictest abortion bans that states like Idaho are putting into play.
*  Interesting.
*  So the Biden administration is kind of rummaging around in its back closet, right, looking
*  for ways to protect abortion rights.
*  There's nothing really there, but it finds this kind of old dress, this law you're talking
*  about.
*  Right.
*  So this is the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act.
*  As an abbreviation, it's referred to as EMTALA.
*  And EMTALA was passed to try to fix a problem that was getting increasingly widespread in
*  the country in the 1980s.
*  And what was happening was a problem called patient dumping.
*  What this meant was that mostly private hospitals, if a patient showed up to their emergency
*  room and the patient didn't have insurance or couldn't otherwise pay, these private hospitals
*  were closing their doors to these patients.
*  And they were sending them to public hospitals, county hospitals.
*  There were these horrific examples of people who were showing up in emergency rooms at
*  public hospitals having been kicked out of the private hospital with stab wounds and
*  gunshot wounds.
*  I mean, there was one case in Texas where a man with third degree burns stumbled into
*  a county hospital with a catheter and an IV line that had been inserted by the private
*  hospital that had kicked him out.
*  Oh my God.
*  And this was creating a lot of public alarm and getting a lot of attention.
*  And some of the cases involved pregnant women in labor.
*  And these private hospitals were turning them away before their babies could be born.
*  And one example in Texas, this woman went to a private hospital and when she told them
*  that her husband had just lost his job, they pushed her legs together, started an IV line
*  and sent her over to this county hospital.
*  And she was crowning, according to the doctor who was at the hospital, and the baby was
*  just coming any minute.
*  She delivered in the hallway of the hospital.
*  So this is a serious public problem.
*  Yeah.
*  Congress is under pressure to take action to try to prevent this.
*  And so in 1986, they enact EMTALA, this federal law, which really was landmark.
*  It was really kind of groundbreaking.
*  And basically what this law does is it says emergency rooms in hospitals that receive
*  is almost all hospitals in the country have to treat any patient that shows up with any
*  emergency medical condition.
*  It requires emergency rooms to stabilize the patient.
*  They have to give at least a basic standard of treatment to make sure that their health
*  doesn't get worse, that their condition doesn't deteriorate.
*  And if they can't do that, they don't have the ability to do that.
*  They have to transfer the patient to a hospital that can.
*  And it crucially does not matter if they can't pay for it or if they have no insurance.
*  But where does abortion come into this?
*  We're obviously talking about this in the context of an abortion fight, right?
*  I mean, from what you're saying, it sounds like this law really had to do with women
*  who were coming in trying to deliver babies, not women who were coming in trying to have
*  abortions to get rid of babies.
*  Exactly.
*  Abortion is not mentioned in EMTALA, and it was not really something that even came up
*  in the passage of the law.
*  The law was really addressing these horror stories of women in labor being turned away
*  from hospital emergency rooms.
*  But the law does include this two word phrase that decades later becomes part of the abortion
*  debate.
*  And that phrase is unborn child.
*  Now at the time, that phrase shows up very much in this context that we've been talking
*  about of women who are about to deliver a baby.
*  So abortion is not mentioned in this law at all.
*  And it wasn't even really in the background of at the time when it was passed.
*  After EMTALA is passed, it has been used over the last four decades to basically try
*  to ensure that patients with all kinds of conditions don't get turned away from emergency
*  rooms.
*  And it doesn't come into the abortion debate until nearly four decades later when the Biden
*  administration decides that it can use this law to try to at least open some cracks into
*  these very rigid state abortion bans.
*  Okay, so you brought us back to the beginning where we started this conversation, which
*  is this current case, right?
*  Idaho versus the Biden administration.
*  So how did that fight actually break out?
*  Yeah.
*  After Roe v. Wade was overturned, a number of states, including Idaho, put into place
*  near total abortion bans.
*  Idaho's ban has very limited exceptions for abortion.
*  And one of the only times abortion is allowed is to keep a pregnant woman from dying.
*  But the Biden administration issues a memo and it says, hey, hospitals, hey, states,
*  they're just reminding you the interpretation of ANTALA applies to women who come to emergency
*  rooms and need emergency abortions.
*  So what the Biden administration is saying is this federal law says preventing death
*  is not the only reason that emergency rooms have to treat people.
*  They also have to prevent people's health situation from getting worse because there
*  are many situations where a woman is bleeding severely or she has a severe infection, but
*  maybe she's not about to die.
*  And so there's a pretty wide gulf between situations where a pregnant woman might need
*  an abortion to save her life and when she might need an abortion to protect her health.
*  So the Biden administration is saying, look, this federal law requires that you protect
*  not just the woman's life, but also the woman's health, which of course brings it into direct
*  conflict with Idaho's ban, right?
*  Exactly.
*  And what the Biden administration is going after here is something much broader, something
*  that goes beyond emergency room care.
*  What they're targeting here is the concept in Idaho's ban that you can't intervene except
*  to save the life of the mother.
*  And by pointing to ANTALA and saying this law requires you to intervene to protect a
*  patient's health, they want to force states with these strict bans to acknowledge and
*  allow abortions in a number of these cases of pregnancy complications that happen.
*  And by doing that, it really wants to also create a crack in the foundation of these
*  abortion bans.
*  Got it.
*  So that's the crack in the foundation that you're talking about.
*  It's not just about this narrow demographic of women who would be in this situation, but
*  it gives them legally, potentially a path to do something bigger.
*  And the Biden administration actually decides to be very aggressive with this EMTALA law.
*  And so very soon after Roe v. Wade is overturned, the Biden administration sues Idaho and says
*  your abortion ban is violating this federal law and your abortion ban cannot stand.
*  And Pam, what does Idaho say in response?
*  What's its argument here?
*  So Idaho says it is not violating EMTALA and it accuses the Biden administration of
*  wanting to turn emergency rooms into abortion clinics and wanting to force Idaho doctors
*  to provide abortions against Idaho's law.
*  And this is also where that phrase unborn child comes up.
*  Idaho is picking up on that language in EMTALA and it's saying that because the federal law
*  mentions unborn child, that that means you have two patients to consider when a pregnant
*  woman goes to an emergency room.
*  And if you're doing an abortion, then you're, in their view, killing one of those two patients.
*  And that's why they are outlawing the ability to do that.
*  So in other words, this law from 1986 is really being used by both sides through the lens
*  of 2024, both by the Biden administration who's saying it says that abortions need to be
*  provided in emergency rooms and by Idaho saying, no, not so fast.
*  The unborn child has equal protection here because that's in the law.
*  Right.
*  So you have both sides using this 40 year old law that really had nothing to do with
*  abortion when it was passed and they're trying to cast it in a light that serves their side
*  of the abortion debate.
*  So this case ends up in the Supreme Court.
*  And it's important to note that this fight isn't just between Idaho and the Biden administration.
*  There are about half a dozen states that have strict abortion bans like Idaho's, including
*  Texas, which has been embroiled in a lawsuit over EMTALA with the Biden administration
*  also.
*  So whatever the Supreme Court rules in this case is going to have implications across
*  the country and it's going to help shape what states can do if they want to ban or restrict abortion.
*  After the break, my colleague, Supreme Court reporter, Abby Vint Sickle, on The Oral Arguments.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Abby, our colleague, Pam Bellick, just walked us through how this very unusual Idaho
*  abortion case got to the Supreme Court.
*  You covered the oral arguments last week.
*  How did they go?
*  So a lot of the oral argument really focused on a question about how far states can go
*  when they are crafting their own abortion laws.
*  And sort of the backdrop of this is that there's part of the Constitution that deals with this
*  question of what happens when a state law and a federal law are in conflict.
*  And it's called preemption.
*  And the general principle is that when a state and federal law collide, if they're in conflict
*  with each other, that the federal law wins.
*  And so the argument in this case really focused in on whether the Idaho abortion law directly
*  conflicted with the federal MTALA law or not.
*  We will hear argument this morning in case 23-726.
*  And the argument started out with the lawyer for Idaho, Joshua Turner.
*  Mr. Turner.
*  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.
*  When Congress amended the Medicare Act in 1986, it put MTALA on a centuries-old foundation
*  of state law.
*  And Turner says that he does not see a direct conflict between Idaho's abortion law and
*  the federal law.
*  Nothing in MTALA requires doctors to ignore the scope of their license and offer medical
*  treatments that violate state law.
*  He argues that in Idaho, if a woman's life is in danger, that there are exceptions that
*  allow abortions and that there's flexibility for doctors to use good faith judgment.
*  And he's saying that Idaho is satisfying the federal law's requirement to provide women
*  with stabilizing care.
*  The Court should reject the administration's unlimited reading of MTALA and reverse the
*  district court's judgment.
*  I welcome the Court's questions.
*  In other words, nothing to see here.
*  Our ban gives exceptions if the woman's life is at risk.
*  And that is in full compliance with this federal law, this MTALA, that mandates care, right?
*  So how do the justices respond to this argument Turner's making?
*  So when the lawyer for Idaho started making that argument, a group of justices right away
*  seemed skeptical.
*  And those were the liberal justices.
*  So the problem we're having right now is that you're sort of putting preemption on its head.
*  Justice Sonia Sotomayor jumped in pretty quickly to say, what do you mean that there's not
*  a conflict between Idaho's abortion law and federal law?
*  Idaho law says the doctor has to determine not that there's merely a serious medical
*  condition, but that the person will die.
*  That's a huge difference, counsel.
*  And you know, to kind of bring this down to earth.
*  Answer the following question, and these are hypotheticals that are true.
*  Sotomayor starts with these hypotheticals of cases, and she explains that they're pulled
*  from real life examples.
*  When delaying an abortion until a woman was close to death had permanent effects on the
*  woman's health.
*  Imagine a patient who goes to the ER with pre-prompt 14 weeks.
*  She gets one example where there's a patient whose water broke at 14 weeks in the pregnancy.
*  She was in and out of the hospital up to 27 weeks.
*  The baby died.
*  She had a hysterectomy, and she can no longer have children.
*  And she said that delaying an abortion caused this woman to lose her fertility.
*  All right, you're telling me the doctor there couldn't have done the abortion earlier.
*  And Justice Sotomayor asks, would Idaho's abortion ban allow abortions in this kind
*  of situation when a woman's health is gravely affected, even though she didn't die?
*  And Idaho's lawyer responds that it's up to the doctor.
*  Again, it goes back to whether a doctor can, in good faith, medical judgment.
*  That's a lot for the doctor to risk.
*  And that this is case by case.
*  The examples are from...
*  That's the problem.
*  I'm kind of shocked, actually, because I thought your own expert had said below that these
*  kinds of cases were covered, and you're now saying they're not?
*  And as this exchange is going on, another justice jumps in, which is a bit of a surprise,
*  because it's Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who is one of the court's conservatives.
*  And she jumps in and says...
*  Well, you're hedging.
*  I mean, Justice Sotomayor is asking you, would this be covered or not?
*  And it was my understanding that the legislature's witnesses said that these would be covered.
*  Wait a second.
*  In the record, in the documents leading up to this case, she thought that Idaho was arguing
*  that those kind of examples, the kind of example where a woman needs an abortion or she has
*  These sort of really extreme loss of organs and loss of future fertility.
*  She says, I thought all of that was covered.
*  She's essentially looking at these medical scenarios and saying, hold on a second.
*  Wait, there's a question here about whether that would be legal and kind of scratching
*  her head, which is interesting and unusual given that she's a conservative who's pretty
*  skeptical usually of arguments in favor of abortion rights.
*  That's right.
*  We can only observe what she said and try to figure it out.
*  But she might have found herself more in an alliance with the liberal justices, which
*  not only would be surprising given her sort of positions and her past record on abortion,
*  but also could potentially set up a gender split on the Supreme Court in an abortion
*  case, which would be pretty stunning.
*  Okay, so interesting kind of gender divide forming here.
*  What do the men on the conservative side of the court say?
*  So the men on the court, the conservative justices, they jumped in pretty quickly after
*  that and Justice Kavanaugh comes in.
*  I just want to focus on the actual dispute as it exists now, today.
*  And he's kind of suggesting that the justices turn away from the hypotheticals and focus
*  back on what it actually says in the legal documents that were filed by each side before
*  the oral argument.
*  ...you have said in your brief at least that each of the conditions identified by the government
*  actually, Idaho law allows an emergency abortion.
*  And Justice Kavanaugh says that the federal government in their briefs listed all these
*  specific conditions where a woman should be provided access to an abortion under the federal
*  and Tala law.
*  And based on Idaho's own legal filings, he says, the state says it would allow exceptions
*  for abortions in these same types of situations.
*  If you're the one who said it in your reply brief, that there's actually no real daylight
*  here in terms of the conditions.
*  So I'm just picking up on what you all said.
*  So in other words, the conservative justices are really kind of responding in the way that
*  we would expect them to, right?
*  They're sympathetic to Idaho's argument.
*  They're saying that law is flexible enough to comply with him, Tala.
*  That's right.
*  Thank you, counsel.
*  And so that sort of wrapped up the first part of the argument.
*  And the next person up to the podium was the lawyer arguing for the federal government.
*  General Prilager.
*  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.
*  So what did the federal government solicitor general argue?
*  What was her case?
*  So Elizabeth Prilager, who, you know, she's actually from Idaho.
*  Oh, right.
*  Yes.
*  And she argues, you know, before the court all the time.
*  And she started out by bringing the argument back to this idea that the liberal justices
*  were really focused on before.
*  No one who comes to an emergency room in need of urgent treatment should be denied necessary
*  stabilizing care.
*  Which is the federal government's view that there is a profound gap between what M. Tala
*  requires and what is in the Idaho abortion law.
*  The situation on the ground in Idaho is showing the devastating consequences of that gap.
*  And she points to the real life consequences of this.
*  One hospital system in Idaho says that right now it's having to transfer pregnant women
*  in medical crisis out of the state about once every other week.
*  That's untenable and M. Tala does not countenance it.
*  And the solicitor general is saying that this has gotten to the point where every other
*  week Idaho hospitals are airlifting women to hospitals in other states to provide abortion
*  care.
*  Airlifted out of state.
*  And is that true?
*  Yeah.
*  So there's been local reporting in Idaho that since this abortion law has gone into effect,
*  which has just been a number of months, that six women have been airlifted to other states.
*  So Justice Kagan pushes on that.
*  It's become transfer is the appropriate standard of care in Idaho, but it can't be the right
*  standard of care to force somebody onto a helicopter.
*  She says that it just doesn't seem to make sense that the right standard of care is to
*  put a pregnant woman on a helicopter to another state.
*  But one of the most interesting things that happens in the interaction with the solicitor
*  general is actually that Justice Alito jumps in and he sort of takes the conversation in
*  a totally new direction.
*  We've now heard, let's see, an hour and a half of argument on this case.
*  And one potentially very important phrase in M. Tala has hardly been mentioned.
*  And that is M. Tala's reference to the woman's quote unquote unborn child.
*  Isn't that an odd phrase to put in a statute that imposes a mandate to perform abortions?
*  Have you ever seen an abortion statute that uses the phrase unborn child?
*  And he says, you know, isn't it strange that this federal law that you are arguing to require
*  abortions includes language that would typically be used by people who are against abortion?
*  It seems that the plain meaning is that the hospital must try to eliminate any immediate
*  threat to the child.
*  But performing an abortion is antithetical to that duty.
*  It's not an odd phrase when you look at what Congress was doing in 1989.
*  And the solicitor general responds by saying, let's look back to what this law actually
*  meant and what it was designed to address in the 1980s.
*  And she explains how when this law went into effect, you know, not only would a woman potentially
*  be dumped from one emergency room if she couldn't pay, but that if a woman came in and the medical
*  problem was actually with the fetus, that she also might be dumped.
*  Congress wanted to expand the protection for pregnant women so that they could get the
*  same duties to screen and stabilize when they have a condition that's threatening the health
*  and well-being of the unborn child.
*  And she says that's actually why the language is there, that it's not sort of anti-abortion
*  code.
*  So what's Alito really up to here?
*  I mean, clearly this idea of unborn child, you know, it's very important in the anti-abortion
*  movement.
*  It's essentially linked to this idea of personhood and that the fetus is actually a person that
*  should be protected.
*  But that's not really what this case hinges on.
*  So what's he doing?
*  You know, we again can't get inside Justice Alito's head, but in the lead up to these
*  arguments, there had been sort of speculation about whether the idea of fetal personhood
*  would make an appearance.
*  It's not the focus of the legal arguments here.
*  But if you look back to the Dobbs case, that case also was not a fetal personhood case,
*  but that language made its way into his opinion.
*  He wrote the majority opinion for the court.
*  And so I think it'll be interesting once a decision comes out, whichever way it goes
*  with this court, whether the language of fetal personhood makes its way into the court's
*  decision in some way.
*  And that is important because, you know, it's the Supreme Court and the language that they
*  use then gets cited by courts and judges all over the country.
*  And right now, fetal personhood is not sort of the accepted mainstream in the legal world.
*  But language like that from the Supreme Court, it could be cited in cases around the country.
*  Interesting.
*  So even though the case isn't actually about that, Alito can just kind of sprinkle it through
*  and it could be cited later as evidence that the Supreme Court is actually elevating this
*  and talking about this.
*  Yeah, that's a possibility.
*  And it's definitely something people will be watching out for when the court makes its
*  decision and the case later this year.
*  Thank you, counsel.
*  The case is submitted.
*  So Abby, do you have a sense after this very interesting set of arguments here, how the
*  justices will rule?
*  You know, we're in a bit of uncharted waters here.
*  It's hard to say how the court is going to come out in this case.
*  Any justice spirit jumping in to say that she was shocked by some of the arguments being
*  made by Idaho raised some questions about whether she could potentially align herself
*  with the other, you know, women justices who are all liberals.
*  But a majority of the conservative justices did seem to be sympathetic to Idaho's arguments.
*  It could be a case that comes down to Justice Barrett and the chief justice, who was actually
*  pretty quiet during arguments and, you know, I wouldn't say that it was clear how he was
*  going to come down on this.
*  And I think that's something that's important about this case is that, you know, it's likely
*  to give us a substantive real window into how the justices now post-Dobbs are thinking
*  about abortion and how it's playing out in all these different ways in states throughout
*  the country.
*  Abby, I guess I'm thinking, you know, whatever the outcome is, there's something else that's
*  happening here.
*  And I'm thinking here about the timing, right?
*  The ruling will come just as the presidential campaign really heats up in the end of June.
*  And we know that very strict abortion bans don't play very well to the mainstream American
*  voters.
*  So if this ruling does go for Idaho, it would draw lines around abortion access that are
*  even more restrictive than many states have at such a political moment.
*  You know, I think it's certainly fair to say that this decision will be closely watched
*  and that it also could draw the court into the politics of abortion.
*  One of the things that I just can't help but think is that when the court made its decision
*  in Dobbs to overturn Roe v. Wade, that Justice Alito made a point of saying that the court
*  was getting out of the business of abortion, that this was something that would be left
*  to the states.
*  And now the court, as we've seen in this case, is wrestling with very sort of granular hypotheticals
*  about the different emergencies that could come up and when is this okay and when is
*  this not okay?
*  And they are still very much in the weeds of abortion.
*  So so much for the Supreme Court being done with abortion cases.
*  It's right back there smack dab in the middle of one of the most contentious issues in American
*  life.
*  That's right.
*  It certainly is.
*  It's hard not to think about the court putting itself again in the middle of this fierce
*  debate in the middle of a huge political fight.
*  Abby, thank you.
*  Thanks so much for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  We can see different cohorts of NYPD officers.
*  One is going across Butler lawns towards Hamilton Hall.
*  On Tuesday, tensions over pro-Palestinian protests continued to escalate on university
*  campuses across the country.
*  At Columbia University in New York, hundreds of police officers in riot gear began arresting
*  demonstrators on Tuesday night, about 20 hours after protesters had occupied a campus building.
*  They're entering the encampment now.
*  I mean, I know a story about Borderlands before.
*  There's about a crowd of, I'd say, 30 or 40 police officers with batons and zip ties
*  right outside the Gaza Solidarity encampment right now.
*  The Columbia University student radio station reported that police used tear gas to disperse
*  people and that at least one person was lying on the ground unconscious during the raid.
*  Earlier in the day, the university closed the campus to everybody but students who lived
*  there and said it would move to expel students who had occupied the building.
*  In Oregon, Portland State University closed its campus after students there broke into
*  its library.
*  Police officers made scores of new arrests at universities in California, Georgia, North
*  Carolina and Virginia.
*  More than 1,000 protesters have been taken into custody on U.S. campuses since the original
*  roundup at Columbia on April 18th.
