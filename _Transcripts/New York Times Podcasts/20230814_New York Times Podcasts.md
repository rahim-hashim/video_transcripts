*  Anela, for someone who's never been to Lahaina town, can you paint a picture of the town
*  for me?
*  I mean, if I were to walk down Front Street, say, what would I see?
*  You could probably see the man on his bike with his current on his shoulder just riding
*  along.
*  You would probably see an elder sitting on the side and just saying hello to everybody,
*  making time to talk story if you wanted to talk story.
*  You see people sitting under the tree, what we call Campbell Park, by the piner inn, which
*  is a nice shading area, it's not too far from the banyan tree.
*  Or if you're under the banyan tree, you'll see people sitting on the benches either having
*  lunch or just taking pictures or just relaxing.
*  You'll see people walking down, having ice cream from David Laffer from the corner.
*  You'll see people going into the ABC store, my T-shirts and little memorabilia, those
*  souvenirs.
*  You'll see people along the wall, what we call the wall, where there was no shopping,
*  it was just the wall of walkways.
*  Standing there and looking at the water, the abstract click, and then out taking pictures,
*  looking at all the delboats.
*  And just enjoying the ambiance of French Shades.
*  You'll walk down further, you'll see more restaurants, there's art galleries, there's the famous
*  Ullulani Shades ice that people just draw to the line with always long fingers.
*  On a hot day, having the shaved ice was such a treat to cool you off.
*  You know, just walking down and going into the stores and just seeing all the people
*  there and walking by and just a sense of peace really.
*  Yeah, it's all gone.
*  It's all gone.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverny-Sea and this is The Daily.
*  This week, wildfires broke out on the Hawaiian island of Maui.
*  They burned so uncontrollably and so quickly that some people had to swim into the sea to
*  survive.
*  As the weekend came to a close, the devastation came into focus.
*  More than 1,000 people are missing and 93 people are dead, making it the deadliest
*  fire in the United States in over a century.
*  One of the hardest hit places was the town of Lahaina on the island's northwestern
*  edge.
*  Lahaina was once the royal capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii.
*  The fire decimated its historic center and at its heart, Waiola Church, the oldest
*  on the island, and a cherished meeting place for Hawaiians.
*  Today, the Minister of that Church, Annella Rosa, talks about what it means to lose Lahaina
*  and what it will take to rebuild it.
*  It's Monday, August 14th.
*  Annella, can I call you Annella?
*  Yes, of course.
*  Hi, honey.
*  Oh, lovely to meet you.
*  Welcome.
*  And my mother's a child.
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  Do I probably lose like 20 minutes?
*  Okay, sorry.
*  Sorry, my niece.
*  Who was that?
*  That's my niece came by.
*  They're loading up the cars.
*  My cousin has a big boat.
*  So they're going to load up the boat and take supplies to Lahaina to the ocean.
*  They need gas.
*  There's no gas station that has gas on the other side.
*  So the cars are running out of gas.
*  Oh, okay.
*  She said they're doing a convoy with the police.
*  So they're taking ice and supplies and all that.
*  So they're gathering all that stuff.
*  So while I'm talking to you, I'm not going to do any labor.
*  Do you need to go?
*  I don't want to keep you from an important task like that.
*  No, no, I have nieces and never.
*  They would never let me work anyway.
*  They would just do the work.
*  They wouldn't let me do anything.
*  That's fine.
*  Okay.
*  So Annella, I wanted to go back to the beginning.
*  Tell me a little bit about yourself.
*  Where'd you grow up?
*  Well, my family's originally from the south side of Maui in an area called Maakena.
*  I come from a very, very big family.
*  And as a child, my grandmother had a point of taking us to grandchildren to LaHina because
*  it's her something grounds.
*  My grandmother was a hard woman.
*  If you didn't know her well, you wouldn't be able to get along with her.
*  You didn't take any crap from anybody.
*  Not even from her kids, the grandchildren or anybody else.
*  But she was raised in the Catholic.
*  We went to the Catholic Church.
*  She showed us where her two brothers were buried.
*  So let us know that this is family.
*  This is where she's from.
*  This is where she grew up.
*  She gave us her history.
*  She took us down to French Street.
*  They used to have an old theater.
*  They had a restaurant there in Okalduya where you'd grab like small bits of pieces to
*  make a little what they call bento, which is like a takeout lunch.
*  She took us to the beach that they went to to go fishing.
*  And she took us there to have a picnic.
*  So my ties to Lahira is to her.
*  And then when I was my mid-20s, I think the job opportunity came available in the mid-80s.
*  I moved to Lahina and I have been there ever since.
*  So how was it?
*  What was it like moving there?
*  What was it like living there once you got there?
*  It was, um, I liked it.
*  I really did.
*  I liked the busyness of Lahina.
*  Both my bike and Lahina's town, afternoons, after my shift.
*  And I saw a lot of tourists.
*  You don't see too many local people down in French Street.
*  You see a lot of tourists because they're the tourist attraction.
*  And you see the excitement in the visitors.
*  You see the excitement as they see something new or something they've never seen before.
*  And it's a good thing to know that we grew up here.
*  We know that we see this all the time, but we cannot take it to Venice.
*  And I was looking for a church, but I wasn't anxious because I still wanted to play and have my fun.
*  And then eventually I hooked up with my aunt and my uncle Earl.
*  They said come to our church, which was white ola.
*  Just come to our church.
*  I did.
*  And the church was always full.
*  We had to sit on the outside because the church was just packed in those days.
*  And I kept coming, incoming, incoming.
*  And that's what started my adventure at white ola.
*  So eventually I got involved with the church and different capacities from a young adult leader to serving as a decan serving as a board member, being a treasure.
*  Because I felt that it was important that my young voice was heard amongst these elders because they're not going to be around for very long.
*  And I need to learn from them what they did, what their thoughts were so that we could carry on the history and the foundation of white ola church.
*  And I'm not sure if you're aware that we celebrated a 200 anniversary just a few months ago.
*  Oh my goodness, you're 200th.
*  Yeah, we're the very first church that was built and founded on Maui.
*  Can you just tell me the history of the church?
*  So the church was founded by Queen, to open learning.
*  And she was the highest ranked queen or highest ranked elite in entire Hawaii.
*  When the missionaries came, I think their first vote landed in 1820.
*  And you know, in the old days, you know, Hawaiians had their own God.
*  But she decided to open the doors and say, no, let's hear what the gospel is saying.
*  And I'm sure what these missionaries are sharing.
*  So she heard it in Awahu, loved it, came to Bali, brought them and wanted the people, her people of the Hina to hear the same word to hear what she heard.
*  So having that under our belt, it meant a lot.
*  It meant a lot for us as a community for our church, white ola.
*  So anyway, one particular minister who was helping us, she was what we called it interim.
*  Because you know, Nella, you have great leadership skills.
*  You should look at it to come in a pastor.
*  I'm like, I am like the farthest, perfect person from being a pastor.
*  I said, I still want to do bad stuff.
*  Oh God, I'm like the last person, please.
*  I still swear, she said, no, no, no.
*  So I said, okay, I'll just go to classes.
*  We'll see.
*  It was a long journey.
*  What changed your mind, Nella?
*  Why did you decide to become a minister?
*  I mean, you sort of felt like you still wanted to do bad things, right?
*  What happened?
*  What changed?
*  I'm not saying I'm perfect.
*  And I tell my congregation every time I am not a perfect person.
*  Don't look at me for that kind of stuff.
*  You're not going to get it.
*  I wanted to help white ola because in the time of trying to find a full time ordained minister,
*  there weren't many local young people going to seminary school because it was quite expensive.
*  And coming back to preach in our local churches.
*  So the last one, two, three, maybe I think the last three or four ministers we had were all from the mainland.
*  They weren't from Hawaii.
*  So in order to for me to make sure that our culture is taking into consideration and everything that we do.
*  And in order to make sure that the people are comfortable because I never want our ordained minister to come from the mainland.
*  I don't understand the history of my church or of the people because it's very, very important.
*  So an element part of your decision to become a licensed minister for this church is to carry forward the legacy of it in some ways, your history, your culture, to make sure it survived.
*  And the culture around it survived.
*  Yes, that's exactly what it was.
*  And that's exactly what it is.
*  And you know when they say that it takes a village to raise a child, this is exactly how line up has been that I have witnessed.
*  I have no children, but there are children in my life that I have watched grown up.
*  I have watched Mary. I have watched have children.
*  I have watched them. Maybe the child that I baptized 20 years ago comes back and tells me, I think you know, they don't always call me call, but I think you baptized me.
*  I said, yeah, I remember. I said, so what are you doing here today? So all I have a baby is okay.
*  So they remember or I watched them grow up.
*  And if I called in by name, I remember having this one boy who was about nine years old.
*  I called him by his first name because how do you know me? I said, because I baptized you.
*  You did? I said, yeah, what's up? You're a mom. I said, I baptized you. So I watched you. You better be good at.
*  You're going to go, whoa, I mean, those things. So this community, this village, it's intense. Everyone knows everyone.
*  Everyone knows your parents. Everyone knows your grandparents.
*  So you really can't get away with much because people are watching, but they're also guiding you.
*  They're also protecting you as much as they can. That's how strong this community is.
*  And now, do you remember what it felt like giving the first sermon that you gave?
*  What did you remember walking into the church and talking in front of people for the first time? What was that like?
*  Oh, my God. I can never forget that because I still have moments.
*  My stomach turned and I mean, I was just, I was in pieces. You know, when I stepped up to the pulpit, I actually had to wait to take the last step up.
*  And I looked out to the graveyard because our pulpit is on that side of the cemetery. I looked out to the graveyard and Uncle Earl's dad, my grandpa, is buried out there with his wife and his family.
*  She was also a minister and he was very well known. He was very popular in Lahira and stuck all over the island. So I looked down and said,
*  to the man, help me. Please give me the strength to do what I need to do so that people can help me and I can help them.
*  You looked out the window and saw the grave of your uncle's father and that gave you strength.
*  It did because his headstone stands out. It's a kind of big black one that's right in line with the pulpit.
*  So I look at that. I mean, I still look at it. Even when I'm sitting down listening to music, I look out there and I look at it and I'm thinking,
*  you set the foundation for my family, for all those behind me, for the legacy behind me that I'm trying to carry forward and the support in that way.
*  But my stomach still turns even to the day after 13 years when I stepped up to the pulpit and I still look out and I said to the man,
*  please help me. Please guide me. Let the words come out.
*  Oh, Judy, she's just trying to call on my other phone. I'm trying to get a hold of her for the last three days because her conference is trying to send us money.
*  But the banks in Lahina has burned the pill box or post offices burn. So I told them you can't send a check because we have no place to get the meal.
*  It won't work. The person has gone.
*  Yeah, my mind is just going in 20 different places. Can you call me but maybe in about 10 minutes and let me get something secured up with Judy.
*  Okay, call you back. Bye.
*  We'll be right back.
*  And now, like, can you tell me when you first heard about the fire? Where were you at that moment?
*  Well, the initial fire in the morning, we were driving out to go to take care of some appointments in the morning about 11 o'clock.
*  We left our home at 11 o'clock.
*  We're going to be right back.
*  We're going to be right back.
*  We're going to be right back.
*  We're going to be right back.
*  We're going to be right back.
*  We're going to be right back.
*  We're going to be right back.
*  We're going to be right back.
*  We're going to be right back.
*  We're going to be right back.
*  We're going to be right back.
*  We're going to be right back.
*  We're going to be right back.
*  We're going to be right back.
*  We're going to be right back.
*  We're going to be right back.
*  We're going to be right back.
*  We're going to be right back.
*  We're going to be right back.
*  We're going to be right back.
*  We're going to be right back.
*  We're going to be right back.
*  We're making bumper little bit
*  onion corks.
*  marvelous paras Torres Driving.
*  What?!
*  This is what happens there?
*  You went thinking okay,
*  don't get
*  This is what happens there?
*  You went thinking okay, don't get it contains.
*  So on our way back about two
*  and three o'clock in the afternoon,
*  Although we got stopped in traffic.
*  On the bypass.
*  On the bypass.
*  He couldn't even see the oxen.
*  He couldn't see the island.
*  The laying out there because the smoke was purring.
*  small, they said, oh my god, there's a little house down there right where the fire was
*  and it's right above the subdivision down by the water. Oh my god, this fire is going
*  to go across the street to the families down there. We have a member that lived there
*  can't get through. We couldn't call anybody. Tell service was down. So I couldn't get
*  you to anyone. I didn't know where she was. Didn't know if she was okay. Then the police came.
*  This is already five hours sitting. They told us that we need to evacuate. People were just
*  moving back. They weren't leaving. They were just moving back hoping that the road would open.
*  So I don't think my cousin who was with me, our girl's daughter and I told her what do you want to do?
*  Do you want to go to Nalani's house in Wei'ehouk or do you want to stay in the line? She's
*  now let's just go to Wei'ehouk and let's just hang out there until they open their own.
*  And then the fire moved north towards Wei'ehouk or Earl. The ministers that I talked about,
*  the Ma'am'kuan'enji, their house burned. I see. And my niece finally got a hold of me today
*  because we're all, I didn't know where they were. We couldn't find them. We couldn't get out. We're
*  just just oh my gosh, where are they? So she finally got to know where they were. She said,
*  at the out of no butter house, she said, honey, the house would run. I said,
*  to the pop of the house gone, your house gone, that house is gone.
*  Anela, did you say that your house was gone? No, my house is fine.
*  My nephew made it to our house. He was doused in our house from yesterday with water just to make
*  sure that he didn't catch a fire. Wow.
*  When did you discover that the fire had started to move north toward the church?
*  When I saw a posting on either Facebook or Instagram,
*  that somebody shared with me and they said, well, the church.
*  So I looked at it and I said, well, the church, that's the hall. That's what that picture is.
*  And it was just in flames. Just, just, just, just, just flying flames.
*  Did you think you'd lost it?
*  I did because the young man that lives in the corner of Thomas,
*  who was a member, he used to want to take care of our graze yards.
*  He was there trying to shoot water on the building trying to save it.
*  But he said the police came, told him he had to evacuate.
*  He said already the hall was up in flames. He said the church of spark had already hit the
*  roof. But he didn't know how it was done because he had to evacuate.
*  And then today someone texted me a picture of the church.
*  The front of the building, which is all concrete and the back building is still standing.
*  But everything in the middle, all wood is gone. Our hall, which is all wood, is gone.
*  The building behind it, there are three structures. The building behind it,
*  which we housed our put on a nail, which is the preschool Hawaiian immersion.
*  That building is gone. What was it like to see that when you got that text on your phone?
*  What was the first thing that came to your mind?
*  Well, it was a little bit of delight because not everything was taken.
*  I heard rumors that the church was completely down to the ground.
*  And then when I saw the picture, I looked at the front lawn. It was still green.
*  The TV's were still green. A little bit of the foundation's still there.
*  And the backside where we had gongrass windows, they're still standing.
*  And the front door that had gongrass windows, they're still standing.
*  But to see at least that part, there's hope.
*  We had a meeting left with our conference minister and other pastors.
*  And I told her, I said, you know, it's just a building.
*  I want to make sure that our congregation is safe. Our community, the people are safe.
*  And it may sound cliche, but it really, we can rebuild this.
*  The church has a history of rebuilding itself.
*  And we will. But my concern really at the moment was the people that make
*  sure that everybody was safe.
*  And how are the people in Ella?
*  As far as I can see, Judy was the last person.
*  I shouldn't say last person. She's one of the persons that I couldn't get a hold of.
*  Gordon, who was also a strong member, just left the board.
*  But he was part of our building in grounds. He lived down the road.
*  I don't know where he is. I haven't heard from him.
*  And then the church has rentals behind the war, which is further down the street.
*  Some of them were evacuated. And I think I heard that one of our church members who lived there,
*  he was evacuated and he's fine.
*  One other person that lives behind the war,
*  Susan, I don't know where she is.
*  But I'm trying to find out from other people, you know,
*  having been in contact with so and so and.
*  And everyone's looking for each other.
*  I mean, I don't even have to ask her.
*  Like, oh, call her. I saw kind of or call her.
*  I can't get hold of so call her. I saw Claire.
*  He's thinking here, you know, you know, things like that.
*  So they're reaching out to let me know that if they reach someone,
*  then they let me know or they let each other know.
*  So because I mean, that congregation, everybody's worried about each other.
*  Yeah.
*  So it sounds like there's still a small handful of people who are missing.
*  There is. Yeah.
*  I'm just thinking that they're safe, but there's just no way to communicate with them.
*  That's what I'm praying for.
*  Right. That there's just not signal where they happen to be right now.
*  Right.
*  Have you lost anybody outside your congregation, Anala?
*  I don't know.
*  Because the first kind of six people, I don't know who they were.
*  The next count that came out of 30 something, I don't know who they were.
*  But I'm not sure. I mean, just your heart, just just everything that this catastrophe can be
*  as big as it was.
*  And see all the pictures, see the helicopter that took the video.
*  I'm like, oh my gosh.
*  This is, this is, this is, this is, I just worked just couldn't come out.
*  My, I mean, I am my moment to start crying because look at me now.
*  Thinking about all the families, the friends, you know,
*  in the last and we don't know how many people we lost and there's still people missing and
*  not accounted for.
*  So amongst the rubbish or whatever that's left to ash, I'm sure there are fine probably people
*  of all those people that passed.
*  I'm sure we'll know a few of them because again, it's a small community.
*  Anala, what does Front Street look like now?
*  Ash, honestly, just ash.
*  It looks like destruction.
*  I only know what a war zone looks like from pictures that I watched on movies.
*  But it was described as a war zone.
*  The pictures that was shared on the internet, videos,
*  you could barely recognize where the places were.
*  And I'm looking at them, like, oh gosh, that's the harbor.
*  I said, okay, that building is set by the bayonetry.
*  I said, oh, that's the parkour's share where the people used to wait for their boats.
*  And they're moving along the line.
*  I'm like, where is that?
*  I mean, I just couldn't place it.
*  I'm like, oh my gosh, it's come in that tree, the elementary school.
*  And I'm only seeing pictures.
*  So until I'm there for the moment and to grasp the moment and just take a deep breath.
*  And like, we walked here, we talked here, we ate here, we sat here, we sang here,
*  we did all of those things.
*  And until that happens, it's hard to grasp.
*  It's really hard to put it into words.
*  Yeah. Do you have plans to go to see with your own eyes in the coming days, if you can?
*  If they open the road, I want to go home and look at the church and just see it for myself with my own eyes.
*  Will you have a church service this Sunday?
*  If I get back home, I'll be there.
*  If I get home and they allow me to go down to that area, I will show up.
*  I won't have a service prepared as I normally do, but if they're still shaded area,
*  right at the edge between the graveyard and the church, so we'll probably sit around there
*  if I can get chared.
*  And just probably do a prayer and just hear from everybody and let everybody just speak their voice.
*  And to share what their needs are and see if we can we can co-cour them in any way by reaching out.
*  It feels like it's important.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I remember the issue when Queen Rilil Kaleni was being overthrown and the congregation
*  at that time, the minister was on the side of overthrowing the queen where the congregation was not.
*  So the doors of the church were closed, but the people, they had church somewhere else
*  until they were able to get that pastor out as they came back to the church.
*  So I think thinking of that story that always comes back to me, I'm like, those are strong congregants.
*  That's what the church is about.
*  It's about surviving.
*  It's about being together.
*  And I hope that this is where we move forward from with the congregation now.
*  I really hope so.
*  And I have faith in my congregation that they will.
*  I believe their belief is very strong and their faith is very strong.
*  Anila, thank you so much for your time and for talking to me even though I know you have
*  so much going on.
*  You're welcome.
*  Thank you.
*  Bye.
*  Okay.
*  Bye.
*  Aloha.
*  So
*  After several attempts to reach her church over the weekend, Anila was unable to get there.
*  She said rescue workers had blocked off the area and told people to stay away
*  as they continued to identify victims.
*  The recovery effort was hampered by the sheer scale of the destruction.
*  Over 2,000 buildings were destroyed, the vast majority, residential,
*  and authorities estimated it would cost over $5 billion to rebuild.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Friday, a Attorney General Merrick Garland elevated the federal prosecutor investigating
*  Hunter Biden to the status of special counsel after negotiations to revive a plea deal
*  on tax and gun charges fell apart.
*  Up until a few days ago, the two sides had been hoping to salvage the deal.
*  But that effort hit a snag when Biden demanded blanket immunity from future prosecution.
*  As special counsel David Weiss, who is also the US Attorney in Delaware,
*  can now pursue charges in endageristic he chooses without seeking the cooperation
*  of local federal prosecutors.
*  The move raised the possibility that Biden could be tried in the politically charged case
*  and that the 2024 election could have questions about the legal fate not only of a former president,
*  but also of the current president's son.
