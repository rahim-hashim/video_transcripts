# The Possible Collapse of the U.S. Home Insurance System
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-obc1GlWI)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Today, my colleague Christopher Flavell, on a Times investigation into one of the least
*  known and most consequential effects of climate change, insurance, and why it may now be a
*  concern for every homeowner in the country.
*  It's Wednesday, May 15th.
*  So Chris, you and I talked a while ago about how climate change was really wreaking havoc
*  in the insurance market in Florida.
*  You've just done an investigation that takes a look into the insurance markets more broadly
*  and more deeply.
*  Tell us about it.
*  Yeah, so I cover climate change, in particular, the way climate shocks affect different parts
*  of American life, and insurance has become a really big part of that coverage.
*  And Florida is a great example.
*  As hurricanes have gotten worse and more frequent, insurers are paying out more and more money
*  to rebuild people's homes, and that's driving up insurance costs and ultimately driving
*  up the cost of owning a home in Florida.
*  So we're already seeing that climate impact on the housing market in Florida.
*  My colleagues and I started to think, well, could it be that that kind of disruption is
*  also happening in other states, not just in the sort of obvious coastal states, but maybe
*  even through the middle of the U.S.?
*  So we set out to find out just how much it is happening, how much that Florida kind of
*  turmoil has in fact become really a contagion that is spreading across the country.
*  So how did you go about reporting this?
*  I mean, where did you start?
*  All we knew at the start of this was that there was reason to think this might be a
*  problem.
*  If you just look at how the federal government tracks disasters around the country, there's
*  been a big increase almost every year in the number and severity of all kinds of disasters
*  around the country.
*  So we thought, OK, it's worth trying to find out what does that mean for insurers?
*  The problem is getting data on the insurance industry is actually really hard.
*  There's no federal regulation.
*  There's no government agency you can go to that holds this data.
*  If you talk to insurers directly, they tend to be a little reluctant to share information
*  about what they're going through.
*  So we weren't sure where to go until finally we realized the best people to ask are the
*  people whose job it is to gauge the financial health of insurance companies.
*  Those are rating agencies, in particular, this one rating company called AMBest, whose
*  whole purpose is to tell investors how healthy an insurance company is.
*  Whoa.
*  So this is like way down in the nuts and bolts of the US insurance industry.
*  Right.
*  So we're part of sort of the broader economy that most people would never experience.
*  But we asked them to do something special for us.
*  We said, hey, can you help us find the one number that would tell us reporters just how
*  healthy or unhealthy this insurance market is state by state over time?
*  And it turns out there is just such a number.
*  It's called a combined ratio.
*  OK.
*  Plain English?
*  Plain English.
*  The ratio of revenue to costs, how much money these guys take in for homeowners insurance
*  and how much they pay out in costs and losses.
*  You want that ratio to be positive.
*  If it's negative, you're in trouble.
*  So what did you find out?
*  Well, we got that number for every state going back more than a decade.
*  And what it showed us was our suspicions were right.
*  This market turmoil that we were seeing in Florida and California has indeed been spreading
*  across the country.
*  And in fact, it turns out that in 18 states last year, the homeowners insurance market
*  lost money.
*  And that's a big jump from five or 10 years ago and spells real trouble for insurance
*  and for homeowners and for almost every part of the economy.
*  So the contagion was real.
*  Right.
*  This is our first window showing us just how far that contagion had spread.
*  And one of the really striking things about this data was it showed the contagion had
*  spread to places that I wouldn't have thought of as especially prone to climate shocks.
*  For example, a lot of the Midwest, a lot of the Southeast.
*  In fact, if you think of a map of the country, there was no state between Pennsylvania and
*  the Dakotas that didn't lose money on homeowners insurance last year.
*  So just huge parts of the middle of the U.S. have become unprofitable for homeowners insurance.
*  This market is starting to buckle under the cost of climate change.
*  And this is all happening really fast.
*  When we did the Florida episode two years ago, it was a completely new phenomenon and
*  really only in Florida.
*  And now it's everywhere.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's exactly what's so striking here.
*  The rate at which this is becoming, again, a contagion and spreading across the country
*  is just demolishing the expectations of anyone I've spoken to.
*  No one thought that this problem would affect so much of the U.S. so quickly.
*  Okay, so in these states, these new places that the contagion has spread to, what exactly
*  is happening that's causing the insurance companies to fold up shop?
*  Yeah, something really particular is happening in a lot of these states.
*  And it's worth noting how it's surprised everyone.
*  And what that is, is formerly sort of unimportant weather events like hailstorms or windstorms,
*  those didn't use to be the kind of thing that would scare insurance companies.
*  Obviously, a big problem if it destroys your home or damages your home.
*  But for insurers, it wasn't going to wipe them out financially.
*  Right.
*  It wasn't just a complete and utter wipeout that the company would then have to pony up
*  a lot of money for.
*  Exactly.
*  And insurers call them secondary perils, sort of a belittling term, right?
*  Something other than a big deal like a hurricane.
*  These minor league weather events.
*  Right.
*  But those are becoming so frequent and so much more intense that they can cause existential
*  threats for insurance companies.
*  And insurers are now fleeing states, not because of hurricanes, but because those former things
*  that were small are now big.
*  Hailstorms, wildfires in some places, previous sort of annoyances are becoming real threats
*  to insurers.
*  Chris, what's the big picture on what insurers are actually facing?
*  Like what's happening out there numbers-wise?
*  This is a huge threat.
*  In terms of the number of states where this industry is losing money, it's more than doubled
*  from 10 years ago to basically a third of the country.
*  The amount they're losing is enormous.
*  In some states, insurers are paying at $1.25 or even $1.50 for every dollar they bring
*  in in revenue, which is totally unsustainable.
*  And the result is insurers are making changes.
*  They're pulling back from these markets.
*  They're hiking premiums.
*  And often they're just dropping customers.
*  And that's where this becomes real, not just for people who surf balance sheets and trade
*  the stock market.
*  This is becoming real for homeowners around the country who all of a sudden increasingly
*  can't get insurance.
*  So Chris, what's the actual implication?
*  What happens when people in a state can't get insurance for their homes?
*  Getting insurance for a home is crucial if you want to sell or buy a home, right?
*  Most people can't buy a home without a mortgage, and banks won't issue a mortgage without home
*  insurance.
*  So if you get a home that an insurance company doesn't want to cover, you get a real problem.
*  You need to find insurance or that home becomes very close to unsellable.
*  And as you get fewer buyers, the price goes down.
*  So this doesn't just hurt people who are paying for these insurance premiums.
*  It hurts people who want to sell their homes.
*  It even could hurt at some point whole local economies, right?
*  If home values fall, governments take in less tax revenue.
*  That means less money for schools and police.
*  It also means people who get hit by disasters and have to rebuild their homes all of a sudden
*  can't because their insurance isn't available anymore.
*  It's hard to overstate just how big a deal this is.
*  And is that actually happening, Chris?
*  I mean, are housing markets being dragged down because of this problem when the insurance
*  markets right now?
*  Anecdotally, we've got reports that in places like Florida and Louisiana and maybe in parts
*  of California, the difficulty of getting insurance, the crazy high cost of insurance is starting
*  to depress demand because not everyone can afford to pay these really high costs even
*  they have insurance.
*  But we wanted to focus on what this story was also, OK, we know where this goes eventually,
*  but where is it beginning?
*  What are the places that are just starting to feel these shocks from the insurance market?
*  And so I called around and asked insurance agents who are the front lines of this.
*  They're the ones who are struggling to find insurance for homeowners.
*  And I said, hey, is there one place that I should go if I want to understand what it
*  looks like to homeowners when all of a sudden insurance becomes really expensive or you
*  can't even find it?
*  And those insurance agents told me, if you want to see what this looks like in real life,
*  go to a little town called Marshalltown in the middle of Iowa.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Chris, you went to Marshalltown, Iowa.
*  What did you find?
*  You know, even before I got to Marshalltown, I had some idea I was in the right spot when
*  I landed in Des Moines and went to rent a car.
*  The nice woman at the desk who rented me a car, she said, what are you doing here?
*  I said, I'm here to write a story about people in Iowa who can't get insurance because of
*  storms.
*  Yeah, I know all about that.
*  It's a big problem here.
*  Okay, even the rental car lady?
*  Even the rental car lady knew something was going on.
*  And so I got in my rental car and drove about an hour northeast of Des Moines through some
*  rolling hills into this lovely little town of Marshalltown.
*  Marshalltown is a really cute little Midwestern town with old homes and a beautiful courthouse
*  in the town square.
*  And when I drove through, I couldn't help noticing all the roofs looked new.
*  What does that tell you?
*  Turns out, Marshalltown, despite being sort of a pastoral image of Midwestern easy living,
*  was hit by two really bad disasters in recent years.
*  First a devastating tornado in 2018.
*  And then in 2020, what's called a derecho, sort of a straight line wind event that's
*  also just enormously damaging.
*  And the result was lots of homes in this small town got severely damaged in a short
*  period of time.
*  And so when you drive down, you see all these new roofs that give you the sense that something's
*  going on.
*  So climate had come to Marshalltown.
*  Exactly.
*  A place that had previously seemed maybe safe from climate change, if there is such a thing,
*  all of a sudden was not.
*  So I found an insurance agent in Marshalltown.
*  I've talked to other agents, but haven't talked to many homeowners.
*  Named Bobby Shamo.
*  And he invited me to his office early one morning and said, you know, come meet some
*  people.
*  And so I parked on a quiet street outside of his office, across the street from the
*  courthouse, which also had a new roof, and went into his conference room and met a procession
*  of clients who all had versions of the same horror story.
*  It was more, well more of double.
*  Huge reduction in coverage with a huge price increase.
*  Some people had faced big premium hikes.
*  I'm just a little small business owner, so every little bit I do feel.
*  They had so much trouble with their insurance company.
*  I was with IMT Insurance forever.
*  And then when I moved in 2020, Bobby said they won't insure a pool.
*  Some people had gotten dropped.
*  So we used to see carriers canceling someone for frequency of three or four or five claims.
*  It's one or two now.
*  Some people couldn't get the coverage they needed, but it was versions of the same tale,
*  which is all of a sudden having homeowners insurance in Marshalltown was really difficult.
*  But I wanted to see if it was bigger than just Marshalltown.
*  So the next day I got back in my car and drove east to Cedar Rapids where I met another person
*  having a version of the same problem, a guy named Dave Langston.
*  Tell me about Dave.
*  Dave lives in a handsome, modest little townhouse on a quiet cul-de-sac on a hill at the edge
*  of Cedar Rapids.
*  He is the president of his homeowners association.
*  There's 17 homes on this little street.
*  And this is just as far as you could get from a danger zone, right?
*  It looks as safe as could be.
*  But in January, they got a letter from the company that insures him and his neighbors
*  saying his policy was being canceled, even though it wasn't as though they'd just been
*  hit by some giant storm.
*  So then what was the reason they gave?
*  You know, they didn't give a reason.
*  And I think people might not realize insurers don't have to give a reason.
*  Insurance policies are year to year.
*  And if your insurance company decides that you're too much of a risk or your neighborhood
*  is too much of a risk or your state is too much of a risk, they can just leave.
*  They can send you a letter saying, forget it, we're canceling your insurance.
*  There's almost no protection people have.
*  And in this case, the reason was that this insurance company was losing too much money
*  in Iowa and didn't want to keep on writing homeowners insurance in the state.
*  That was a situation that Dave shared with tens of thousands of people across the state
*  that were all getting similar letters.
*  What made Dave's situation a little more challenging was that he couldn't get new insurance.
*  He tried for months through agent after agent after agent, and every company told him the
*  same thing.
*  We won't cover you.
*  Even though these homes are perfectly safe and a safe part of the state, nobody would
*  say yes.
*  And it took them until basically two days before their insurance policy was going to
*  route until they finally found new coverage that was far more expensive and far more
*  bare bones than what they'd had.
*  But at least it was something.
*  It was something but the problem was it wasn't that good.
*  Under this new policy, if Dave's streets got hit by another big windstorm, the damage from
*  that storm and fixing that damage would wipe out all the savings set aside by these homeowners.
*  The deductible would be crushingly high, $120,000 to replace those roofs if the worst happened.
*  Because the insurance money just wouldn't cover anywhere close to the cost of rebuilding.
*  He said to me, we didn't do anything wrong.
*  This is just what insurance looks like today.
*  And today it's us and Cedar Rapids.
*  Everyone though is going to face a situation like this eventually.
*  And Dave is right.
*  I talked to insurance agents around the country and they confirmed for me that this kind of
*  a shift towards a new type of insurance, insurance that's more expensive and doesn't cover as
*  much and makes it harder to rebuild after a big disaster.
*  It's becoming more and more common around the country.
*  So Chris, if Dave and the people you spoke to in Iowa were really evidence that your
*  hunch was right, that the problem is spreading and rapidly, what are the possible fixes here?
*  The fix that people seem most hopeful about is this idea that what if you could reduce
*  the risk and cause it to be less damaged in the first place?
*  So what some states are doing is they're trying to encourage homeowners to spend more money
*  on hardening their home or adding a new roof or if it's a wildfire zone, cut back the vegetation,
*  things that can reduce your risk of having really serious losses.
*  And to help pay for that, they're telling insurers, you've got to offer a discount to
*  people who do that.
*  And everyone who works in this field says, in theory, that's the right approach, right?
*  The problem is number one, hardening a home costs a fantastic amount of money.
*  So doing this at scale is hugely expensive.
*  Number two, it takes a long time to actually get enough homes hardened in this way that
*  you can make a real dent for insurance companies.
*  We're talking about years or probably decades before that has a real effect, if it ever
*  works.
*  Okay, so that sounds not particularly realistic, given the urgency and the timeline we're on
*  here.
*  So what else are people looking at?
*  Option number two is the government gets involved.
*  And instead of most Americans buying home insurance from a private company, they start
*  buying it from government programs that are designed to make sure that people, even in
*  risky places, can still buy insurance.
*  That would be just a gargantuan undertaking.
*  The idea of the government providing homeowners insurance because private companies can't
*  or won't would lead to one of the biggest government programs that exist, if we could
*  even do it.
*  So huge change.
*  But the federal government actually trying to kind of right these markets by itself by
*  providing homeowners insurance.
*  But is that really feasible?
*  Well, in some areas, we're actually already doing it.
*  The government already provides flood insurance, because for decades, most private insurers
*  have not wanted to cover flood.
*  It's too risky, it's too expensive.
*  But that change with governments taking over that role creates a new problem of its own.
*  Because the government providing flood insurance that you otherwise couldn't get means people
*  have been building and building in flood prone areas, because they know they can get that
*  guaranteed flood insurance.
*  Interesting.
*  So that's a huge new downside.
*  Like the government would be incentivizing people to move to places that they shouldn't
*  be.
*  That's right.
*  But there's even one more problem with that approach of using the government to try to
*  solve this problem, which is these costs keep growing, right?
*  The number of billion dollar disasters the US experiences every year keeps going up.
*  And at some point, even if the government pays the cost through some sort of subsidized
*  insurance, what happens when that cost is so great that we can no longer afford to pay
*  it?
*  That's the really hard question that no official can answer.
*  So that's pretty doomsday, Chris.
*  Are we looking at the end of insurance?
*  I think it's fair to say that we're looking at the end of insurance as we know it.
*  The end of insurance.
*  That means most Americans can rest assured that if they get hit by a disaster, their
*  insurance company will provide enough money they can rebuild.
*  That idea might be going away.
*  And what it shows is maybe the threat of climate change isn't quite what we thought.
*  Maybe instead of climate change wrecking communities in the form of a big storm or a wildfire or
*  a flood, maybe even before those things happen, climate change can wreck communities by something
*  as seemingly mundane and even boring as insurance, right?
*  Maybe sort of the harbinger of doom is not a giant storm, but an anodyne letter from
*  your insurance company saying, we're sorry to inform you, we can no longer cover your
*  home.
*  Maybe sort of the future of climate change is best seen not by pouring over weather data
*  from NOAA, but by pouring over spreadsheets from rating firms showing the profitability
*  from insurance companies and how bit by bit that money that they're losing around the
*  country tells its own story.
*  And the story is these shocks are actually already here.
*  Chris, as always, terrifying to talk to you.
*  Always a pleasure, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what you should know today.
*  On Tuesday, the United Nations has reclassified the number of women and children killed in
*  Gaza, saying that it does not have enough identifying information to know exactly how
*  many of the total dead are women and children.
*  The UN now estimates that about 5,000 women and about 8,000 children have been killed,
*  figures that are about half of what it was previously citing.
*  The UN says the numbers dropped because it is using a more conservative estimate while
*  waiting for information on about 10,000 other dead Gazans who have not yet been identified.
*  And Mike Johnson, the Speaker of the House, gave a press conference outside the court
*  in Lower Manhattan where Michael Cohen, the former fixer for Donald Trump, was testifying
*  for a second day, answering questions from Trump's lawyers.
*  Trump is bound by a gag order, so Johnson joined other stand-ins for the former president
*  to discredit the proceedings.
*  Johnson, one of the most important Republicans in the country, attacked Cohen, but also the
*  trial itself, calling it a sham and political theater.
*  Today's episode was produced by Nina Feldman, Shannon Lin, and Jessica Chung.
*  It was edited by M.J. Davis Lin with help from Michael Benoit, contains original music
*  by Dan Powell, Marian Lozano, and Rowan Mimisto, and was engineered by Alyssa Moxley.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landsvark of Wonderly.
*  That's it for the Daily.
*  I'm Sabrina Tavernisi.
*  See you tomorrow.
