*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Borrow. This is Adali.
*  Ozempic and a popular new class of medications like it are revolutionizing the medical treatment
*  of obesity and the way that we think about and talk about weight.
*  Today, my colleague, Danny Blum, on the story behind these drugs and the very different
*  experiences of two people who took them.
*  It's Monday, September 18th.
*  Danny, it is very rare to be able to say the name of a new pharmaceutical drug and
*  have it immediately mean something to pretty much everyone. But that very much seems to be
*  the case with the drug that you and I are going to be talking about today, Ozempic.
*  Yeah. I mean, I've never seen anything like this in my lifetime where people are tossing
*  this name around.
*  There is such a cool weight loss medication in the pipeline that I have to tell you about.
*  It is all over social media. I got my Ozempic yesterday. I'm nervous, I'm not going to lie.
*  Another hockey mom, she's on it as well. She looks fabulous. It's on TikTok. You can't
*  go on YouTube or even watch TV without seeing that really catchy Ozempic commercial.
*  Jolo, you look thin. Thank you. Ozempic? Yep. Everybody looks so great. When I look around
*  the show, I can't help but wonder, is Ozempic right for me?
*  It is absolutely everywhere and it is so massive that it's something that I am thinking
*  about, talking to people, about hovering pretty much every day.
*  So how do you explain why this drug has become the subject of so much chatter, so much
*  conversation, so many wheels on Instagram that I watch it one in the morning?
*  I think it's pretty simple. These drugs are really effective at helping people lose weight.
*  I should clarify, first, Ozempic has become this sort of shorthand umbrella term for an entire
*  class of medications. But these drugs come at a really complicated moment in the medical
*  community and in our culture. Just explain that. What do you mean?
*  So we know that doctors are excited about these drugs because they offer a potential solution
*  to what they have long viewed as a public health crisis, obesity. More than 40% of Americans
*  have obesity. And while there's an evolving conversation around the link between health
*  and body size, right? You know that you can be metabolically healthy and in a larger body.
*  We also know that obesity is linked with a number of really devastating health conditions.
*  Cardiovascular disease, cancer risk. At the same time, we also have an evolving conversation
*  in our culture around beauty standards and body image. We've had this thin ideal that
*  is deeply entrenched, I think, especially in America. And over the last decade, it seemed
*  like we were starting to finally chip away at that. We had fashion stores start to offer
*  a wider range of sizes. We had celebrities embrace the body positive movement. And
*  it's not like this movement just totally neutralizes the thin ideal in our culture, right?
*  But you have real momentum and then ozampic walks in and just sort of drops a bomb into
*  that entire conversation. So Danny, what is the backstory of this drug, ozampic and drugs
*  like it that are having such an enormous medical and cultural moment right now?
*  So ozampic belongs to this class of drugs called GLP1s. That stands for glucogon like
*  peptide one receptor agonist doesn't roll off the tongue exactly. And so GLP1 medications
*  start rolling out in the US for diabetes in 2005. And that's because they're really effective
*  at regulating blood sugar and insulin. But what patients and doctors also notice is they
*  have this welcome side effect, which is they induce weight loss. And then when pharmaceutical
*  companies like nobunortiske, the company that makes ozampic continue to develop and study
*  these drugs, they keep on seeing that we lost side effect. So weight loss is not what this
*  medicine is at first designed to do, but it is a side effect that no doubt captures a lot of
*  attention. Right. And then in 2017, the FDA approves ozampic, which is this once a week injectable
*  that people with type two diabetes can take. And researchers who studies the maglatide, the active
*  ingredient in ozampic find that people who are on the medication for over a year lose around 15%
*  of their body weight, which is a pretty significant amount of weight in a not very long period of time.
*  So how do we come to understand why the drug does that? So these medications are called GLP1s
*  because they mimic this naturally occurring hormone that our bodies release after we have a meal.
*  And what that means is that these medications make you feel fuller, faster, for longer. They slow
*  down the emptying of the stomach, but what they also do is they target the brain. So the parts of
*  your brain that are hungry, that regulate your appetite, these medications directly affect that.
*  And do we know specifically how ozampic does that? So we don't totally understand how it works.
*  This is something that a lot of researchers are working to entangle, but this isn't all that
*  unusual, right? We have plenty of medications that are pretty common, like antidepressants,
*  that we don't totally understand just how they affect the brain and the ways that they do.
*  Got it. And researchers shown that if you stop taking this medication, it stops working.
*  It's like a statin or a medication for blood pressure. And so when people go off these drugs,
*  they tend to regain a lot of the weight. And in some cases, they gain even more weight than they
*  had before they even took the medication. And so because these drugs are newer, we don't have a
*  ton of long-term data. We just don't know what this medication does to you after 50 years, which
*  in theory is how long some people are going to stay on them. This is something that comes up in
*  conversations with doctors, especially when people are turning to these medications who are not
*  obese or they're not diabetic. When people are weighing the potential costs and benefits of taking
*  a medication like this, there are a number of open questions, especially when people try to take
*  these drugs for things they're not officially approved for. Interesting. So how do we get from this
*  approved medicine for diabetes that people realize can result in this meaningful amount of weight
*  loss for people who take it to this drug being used out in the world for that explicit purpose that
*  is garnered all this attention, the idea of a drug like this as an intentional weight loss treatment.
*  Well, people have been taking ozumbic for weight loss for a few years, but 2021 is when things
*  really start to shift, starting in the summer when the FDA approves wagovi for weight management.
*  And this is a medication that is really similar. It's a higher concentration of the same compound
*  that's in ozumbic except this time it's approved for people who have obesity or who are overweight and
*  have a number of different health conditions related to that. And what happens is that there's so much
*  demand for wagovi. There are so many people who are trying to get their hands on that drug that then
*  ozumbic becomes this backup plan and it gets so prominent that people are seeking out ozumbic
*  because they're not able to get their hands on wagovi. God, and even though ozumbic isn't really
*  meant for weight loss, the demand for it exists. And it sounds like there are plenty of doctors who are
*  willing to write a prescription for it even when the patient doesn't have diabetes. Exactly. And
*  most people who take these drugs off label their insurance company isn't going to cover a diabetes
*  drug unless they have diabetes, right? So they're going to end up paying full price out of pocket,
*  which is extremely expensive. It's like around $1,000 a month. So in spring 2022, you're starting
*  to see these drugs go into shortages. Demand is so high that diabetes patients are really struggling
*  to access ozumbic. And this demand is also fueled by this real swirl on social media when people
*  start talking about which celebrities are potentially on ozumbic. It becomes this sort of detective
*  game on TikTok where people are pointing to different prominent figures and saying, you know,
*  look at so and so she dropped 30 pounds. It must be ozumbic. That's part of how this drug
*  becomes so popular. And then in the fall of 2022, someone tweets at Elon Musk basically saying
*  something to the effect of like, hey, Elon, you're looking really fit these days. What's your secret?
*  And he tweets wagovie, which you know, with all things, Elon people become really interested in
*  this. So search results store. And this is the moment it really enters the mainstream in this way
*  where ozumbic has become a household name. Right. And at this point, the conversation around these
*  drugs is almost exclusively focused on weight loss rather than its original purpose diabetes.
*  Exactly. It becomes synonymous with losing weight. And this is when these really important
*  questions come up. It moves from being this sort of tabloid fodder into the center of what I
*  think is a really vital discussion about weight and weight loss and health in our society.
*  And we know that obesity is linked with a number of really devastating conditions. But we've had
*  this momentum pushing the focus away from weight and instead focusing on one, making sure people
*  are healthy, but then also making sure that we don't have this really psychologically damaging
*  emphasis on people being skinny, skinny, skinny at all costs. And what happens when we have more people
*  talking about these medications, taking these medications, you know, is that we have the focus
*  being put squarely back on weight. And this is something that people who are taking these
*  medications are sort of wrestling with in real time. As they're taking a medication that has
*  potentially profound impacts on their health, they're also doing this kind of intellectual
*  gymnastics and thinking about what it means. And so I've really been interested in these questions
*  and because these drugs are so widespread, there has been no shortage of finding people
*  to talk to who are on these medications. And I talked to two women in particular who I think
*  really illustrate what it's like to grapple with these challenges. And for both of them,
*  they described these drugs as being life changing, but in vastly different ways.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Danny, right before the break, you were talking about how many people you have spoken with
*  who are on these drugs and are wrestling with what it means to be on these drugs. And you said that
*  two women in particular stood out to you. So tell us about these women.
*  Wendy? Hello. Hi. Hey. So the first one, her name is Wendy Gant. So maybe we could just start
*  off with the basics. Like she's in her 50s. She loves in North Carolina. She works as a mental
*  health counselor. Well, this was last summer. Yeah. And like so many people, she found out about these
*  drugs on TikTok. And they really appealed to her because she had been struggling with weight
*  for essentially her entire life. I can't remember always being a pudgy kid. So she remembers going
*  on her first diet when she was around 10 years old and her parents offered to pay me to lose 10 or
*  20 pounds, whatever it was. They actually paid her to try to lose weight. I can remember in seventh grade,
*  there was a diet going around where you ate seven great fruit one day. I think it was seven
*  boiled eggs a neck and maybe like seven bananas or hot dogs, something stupid. And she's spent a
*  lot of her life going through pretty much every diet you've ever heard of. And when she becomes
*  an adult, this sort of goes from being a mental preoccupation to a medical problem.
*  It was a wake up call for me two years ago because my cholesterol was just climbing. It was the
*  first time I ever heard that my liver numbers looked irregular. And the doctor basically says,
*  for the benefit of her health, she needs to lose a significant amount of weight. And she's really
*  frustrated about this, right? Because she's tried diet and exercise, all the sorts of standard
*  medical advice to lose weight. And it hasn't worked for her. And then she's scrolling through TikTok
*  when they women were talking about their manjaro journey. You know, that's what they would call them.
*  And she sees people talking about manjaro, which like ozampic is a medication that is approved for
*  diabetes, but can induce weight loss. Their story sounded like my story. And so she's really attached
*  to this idea of a medication that can solve this problem for her, right? Now there's an option.
*  I was like, heck yeah, this sounds amazing.
*  And what she starts to think is, you know, why don't I seek this out for myself?
*  I filled everything out online. I got assigned a provider. And she sees people talking about a
*  certain telehealth company that can offer them really fast prescriptions. It was less than 24 hours.
*  I had the prescriptions in mid-war. And within 24 hours, she gets a prescription for manjaro.
*  I took my first injection, you know, as soon as I got home, I could not get that out of the box
*  laughing off and jab myself with it. And then pretty much as soon as she takes that first injection,
*  she feels different. I woke up the next morning and my first priority was not going down.
*  There's been making myself a breakfast. You know, that that loop of have a good breakfast,
*  have a big breakfast. And then what are you going to have? And to not have that food chatter on loop
*  is really freeing. She told me that it was like the switch just went off in her brain.
*  It was a sense of relief. And I thought, wow, I don't care about food. And I just went about my day.
*  What exactly is she describing as happened to her relationship to food when she's
*  out taking this drug? So something people bring up to me a lot is this concept of food noise,
*  right? This like constant low-level chatter in the back of your brain. That's like, what are
*  they going to eat next? What's my snack? When's breakfast? When's all this? And for her,
*  all of that just shut off. It's the first time in my life that I've ever felt normal.
*  She didn't have that sort of rumination in her brain anymore. I kept saying, this must be what's
*  getting people to feel like. This must be how normal people's brains work. And for her,
*  she was like, oh, this is what a healthy relationship to food actually presents us.
*  It reminds me a little bit of how people who take anti-anxiety medication describe the noise of
*  doubt and worry in their heads. The volume of that just suddenly going down. And by the way,
*  I'm one of those people. I take Lexa Braille. So that's a familiar concept. She's saying that
*  a kind of unambited guest in her head is going away. Yeah, I think that's a really good comparison.
*  And for Wendy, without that sort of constant voice, she was able to listen and sort of adhere to
*  some of the guidance that doctors have been giving her for her entire life. I've always tried to make
*  sure, okay, I get this amount of steps. I'm going to move my body. I'm going to do this. I'm going
*  to do that and stay active. But in the past, you know, it didn't have an impact on my weight.
*  And now it does. I try to. So she's more able to exercise. She's able to make those healthy food
*  choices. It's not as hard to want to eat vegetables or to balance your meals as it was a year ago.
*  And what actually happens to her weight when she's on this medication? So she loses a ton of weight.
*  Last year, beginning the medication, I've lost 40 pounds. And she loses about 20% of her body weight.
*  My arthritis is way better. My knees don't hurt. My plan is,
*  last year, I just said, my right foot is gone. She feels better.
*  Is this medication just quelled the food noise part for me forever? I would be a happy
*  camper, even if I didn't lose another pound. So this feels like a case study in why this new
*  class of drugs is so popular right now. Wendy is somebody who struggled with weight, literally
*  her entire life. And from what she says, this is the first treatment that has made a measurable
*  difference for her, her weight, her health. But I'm curious how Wendy feels about these larger,
*  as you call them, intellectual, gymnastic questions about self-acceptance and body positivity.
*  And what it means to now have a drug that solves this problem for her in a way that never existed
*  before. Is she grappling with any of that? So for Wendy, this is the simple part. I think people
*  like me who have struggled for years and years and years and who have never been offered,
*  you know, help from a medication like this, you feel really judged. And you also don't always
*  feel like you're believed. Before she had this medication, that was when things were complicated.
*  All of the mental churning of figuring out what to eat and all of the self-blame her entire life,
*  that was when things got really thorny. But when she was able to access this medication,
*  then it was really the best case scenario for her. The weight was a medical problem,
*  her doctor had warned her about it. And she had a really effective solution.
*  But that's definitely not the case for everyone. I talked to about these medications. And for the
*  second moment I spoke with, things got a lot messier. So tell us about the second woman you spoke with.
*  So her name is Renata Lavexavi. How's it going?
*  And she's in her mid-30s. She lives in New Jersey. And at first, her story looks pretty
*  similar to Wendy's. And then I've been one of those type of people who would exercise rigorously
*  control what I was eating when I was eating. She's someone who has sort of desperately tried to lose
*  weight for a lot of her life. Either I'm losing my mind or this isn't working, like this is not
*  possible. She sort of felt like she was going crazy because she was putting in all this effort
*  and not seeing any results. And so she went to her endocrinologist and she got diagnosed with PCOS.
*  Is there for polycystic ovarian syndrome?
*  It's a hormonal condition and it makes it really difficult to lose weight. If you're overweight
*  with PCOS, you can have some pretty serious health complications. And so after she gets this
*  diagnosis, she goes to see a nutritionist and she ends up with someone who specializes in
*  intuitive eating. Which is?
*  It's this philosophy of focusing on foods that make you feel better.
*  I first sounded so kind of like woo-woo and like, oh, I'm going to think about what you eat
*  this for me. How is that going to help you with anything?
*  It really made more sense. It's about taking the time to actually appreciate how your body is
*  feeling before and after eating different types of food. And so she still is keeping an eye on
*  her health, but she stops dieting and she stops moralizing food as good or bad.
*  I had no longer been weighing myself daily or being obsessed with over, but instead trying to
*  look at other measures of health such as how I felt, my energy levels rather than the number
*  in the scale. And she says that she reaches this really healthy place with food. With her body,
*  she's at peace and that's something that's come with a lot of work for her.
*  But then she goes to a doctor's appointment.
*  Again, I didn't bring it up. I didn't say, hey, Doc, I really need something to help me lose weight.
*  What can I do? She on her own brought up so she's new medications.
*  Her doctor says, look, there's a drug called ozambic and it can help you lose weight.
*  Was it willing to take the chance that if this is going to be beneficial for me in some way,
*  that maybe I can't see, then I'll give it a shot.
*  So unlike Wendy, we're not, it is not somebody who is seeking out these drugs.
*  She takes the advice of her doctor who is the one who raises it seriously and decides to go on it.
*  Exactly. And she feels the effects of these drugs almost immediately.
*  I remember that day, I was like, okay, this is it.
*  Taking the medication. This is your last corolla. You better have a great big meal.
*  And so I had a nice big dinner and about 10 minutes afterwards, I took the injection.
*  And within an hour, I felt more bloated and full than I have in my entire life.
*  What is happening? What is this?
*  And I just felt so sick, so nauseous.
*  She had this sense of like, this is in my system now and I have to ride this out, whatever it is.
*  And so eventually she feels a little bit better. She digests her dinner, but that nausea stays with
*  her. This sort of like low level queesiness that never really goes away.
*  But what exactly is happening here? I remember you describing these drugs,
*  function as slowing down the digestive system. So is that what happens here?
*  Basically she ate a meal and it just took a really long time to digest.
*  Yeah, I mean, this is pretty much par for the course with these medications.
*  It takes longer for food to leave your stomach. And so a lot of people have nausea,
*  especially when they're first starting to take these medications.
*  Feeling like the food is like right there. You can't see me, but I'm putting my hands on my throat,
*  you know, like right at your throat.
*  But for Renata, it's really severe. Like her house got messy because she was worried if she bent
*  over to pick something off the floor, she would throw up on the spot.
*  I definitely had a hard time eating anything that was protein rich because it's harder to digest.
*  And therefore, we may feel sicker.
*  Yeah. So throughout all of that, was there any point in which you actually had an appetite?
*  At the guy? I don't know if I ever felt hungry. I know what time is where I felt less nauseous.
*  I'm like eating didn't sound disgusting. You know, if you don't eat for too long,
*  you can actually get nauseous. So what she ends up doing is actually setting a bunch of alarms
*  to try to remind herself when to eat.
*  The morning would be me transforced myself to eat something to lower my nausea so that later
*  in the day, I could have a little more. But if I didn't have anything, I just didn't have enough,
*  then the nausea would just get worse and worse and worse and worse. And then, you know,
*  what's the last thing you want to do when you're not just eat, right? So then it becomes like a
*  cycle that you can't break out of.
*  So given all of this, some sounds awful. Does she stop taking this drug?
*  No. And even when she feels really fatigued, even when she starts having really low energy,
*  she keeps taking the medication.
*  It was sort of a sunk cost. Well, not gonna quit now.
*  So she kept seeing her nutritionist.
*  And I was explaining to her how I was just
*  she was sleeping over 10 hours and still feeling really tired. And the nutritionist basically said
*  that Bernata might be malnourished.
*  Essentially, this medicine is making her eat so little that she's not getting enough nourishment.
*  Exactly. She is so little appetite that she's just not consuming enough nutrients.
*  All of it felt very bizarre and still overweight.
*  And I only had lost eight pounds for a month. Even after taking this medicine,
*  somehow now both overweight and now nervous. Like, how does that work?
*  This really throws her for a loop because for her whole life, she's basically been told that
*  if anything, she's over-nourished, right? She's overweight and now she's on this medication
*  to do something about that. And she's not getting enough nutrients.
*  It was a hard to reconcile that with how I know I look.
*  And I want to be clear that malnourishment is really rare, right?
*  We're talking about an extreme outcome. There are side effects that happen more commonly with
*  these medications. Nubanordesca, the company that makes ozumptych tends to cite nausea and diarrhea,
*  vomiting, all those icky things. But these are the sort of risk and benefit trade-offs that people
*  make when they're deciding to take the medication or deciding if they want to stay on it.
*  Are the side effects worth the results? And so, Bernata just plans to bring this up with her doctor
*  at her next check-up. But she expects that her doctor is going to stay the course and continue.
*  But no, her reaction was, this is appalling. It's really not a good trick for you. Let's
*  stop this medicine immediately. And for her, it's sort of a worst-case scenario because she goes
*  off the medication. She actually starts gaining some of the weight she lost back. And this entire
*  relationship with food that she's come to such a delicate equilibrium about has gotten super
*  complicated over the course of taking this medication. Well, just explain that. What do you mean?
*  So because she would have to go through all this effort to remind herself to eat,
*  she was thinking about food all the time. Everything, all day long. What am I getting to my next
*  month? Do I have the food? Can I prepare it now? What am I going to buy? If I go somewhere,
*  will they have something I can eat? Right? It became having to be obsessed with food in order to
*  survive in order to be able to eat enough food to live every day. And she had done so much work
*  to get to a place where she didn't have that sort of mental negotiation. And I made a lot of
*  psychological mental progress on how I valued myself being independent of my weight,
*  trying to separate the focus of food as being something that nourishes me and provides me with
*  the energy I need versus good and bad, not looking at the scale. I had done a lot of work mentally
*  to get away from that type of toxic environment that's so focused on weight, equal and beauty.
*  And it felt as if by starting the ozambic as if I was kind of being untrue to that. Like,
*  and now I'm taking a short cut to this weight because apparently I do care about weight.
*  You know, like it felt like that was undoing a lot of the mental work I had been doing to deem
*  precise weight. So Danny, we are left with two very different accounts of what it's like to
*  be on these new drugs in their earliest days. But what seems undeniable is that whether these
*  drugs work as they seem to have for Wendy or whether they have not worked and had terrible side effects
*  as they did with her anada, that these drugs are going to be changing our relationship to weight
*  both medically and culturally. Yeah, I think they speak to a really monumental shift because for so
*  long, right, we viewed obesity as a sort of moral failing. I think a lot of our culture speaks
*  to this idea of, you know, thinness is a virtue. It is something to strive for. And if someone has
*  access weight, that is their fault. And what these medications do is they basically offer an
*  acknowledgement of like, this is a chronic condition. This is a disease. And what do we treat
*  diseases with medication? And so from one perspective, these medications are a way to take
*  morality out of the equation. Right, because as with mental health, the availability of a treatment
*  says to the world, this is out of anyone person's control. And it requires a medical intervention.
*  Exactly. But on the other hand, you sort of have this other thorny issue of like, if you can treat
*  obesity with a medication and everyone knows you have that option, right? Let's say in theory,
*  then what happens when you elect not to take a medication like this? What happens when you don't
*  want to deal with a side effects or you can't tolerate them? And you're left in a larger body
*  in a world where increasingly that is becoming almost an option. And so I asked both of these women,
*  if having this medication becoming more and more available, does it sort of emphasize these
*  expectations around being thin? Does it undermine the progress that positivity has made?
*  That's an interesting perspective. For Wendy, she's not really worried about the stigma around weight
*  getting worse. What I hope is is that medical professionals who are the ones on the front lines
*  with individuals that they can be more educated about what all the options are so that a person can
*  make a decision based on informed consent, whether you want to take the meds or you don't want to
*  take a med. To her, the real problem would be someone who is struggled with their weight, not having
*  an option to access treatment, now that there's one that's finally available.
*  Not everyone who is psychotic wants to take an anti-psychotic drug. Not everyone who wants to be in
*  recovery wants to be an abstinent. Typically, there's a reason why someone makes the choices they make.
*  But for Renata, she's very worried about the stigma this creates.
*  I just hope that people don't view it as why are you still fat when everybody else is just taking
*  ozemic and losing the weight. That's something I think about, whether it will cause people to be even
*  more judgmental of others. She's worried that what happened to her, that this piece she worked so
*  hard to create with her body and with her relationship to food, that's going to get disrupted on a
*  larger scale. What Renata's software is, these medications, they don't work for everyone.
*  It's more complicated. There are side effects. There are other considerations. But if people don't
*  understand that, maybe there will be a new layer of stigma around being in a larger body.
*  What you're describing, and what Renata and Wendy are describing, are ultimately questions of
*  psychology and culture, and they're going to play out over a long period of time. But my sense is
*  that the companies that make these drugs are focused on the huge market that now exist for them,
*  regardless of how they are going to fundamentally, as you said, monumentally change our
*  expectations and our conversation around weight. Yeah, the pharma industry is barreling forward with
*  this. There are dozens of these drugs that are in development. There are pill forms of ozemic on
*  the horizon. There are experimental drugs that are even more powerful. I mean, it's like the entire
*  goalposts for what researchers and doctors consider to be successful weight loss. That is all
*  shifted. And what doctors have told me is what we're seeing now is the kind of weight loss that they
*  wouldn't have dreamed of 10 years ago. Now that's a given. And so more of these drugs are going to
*  be approved pretty soon for weight management specifically. And these medications are being studied
*  beyond weight loss. There's data that's trickling out about whether they're protective against
*  cardiovascular issues, whether these medications can treat addictions. And I don't think we're
*  going to be able to put the genie back in the bottle after this. It's only going to go broader from here.
*  Well, Danny, thank you very much. We appreciate it. Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. In a closely watched impeachment trial, the controversial
*  attorney general of Texas Ken Paxden was acquitted by fellow Republicans over the weekend.
*  The trial was a test of Republican party loyalty and whether in the hyperpartisan era of Donald
*  Trump, Republican lawmakers would be willing to use the impeachment process to oust one of their own
*  from office. Paxden, a Trump ally was impeached in May by the Republican controlled Texas House
*  over allegations that he repeatedly abused his office to help a Texas real estate investor,
*  who in turn allegedly paid for Paxden's home to be remodeled and for Paxden's mistress to get a
*  job. But on Saturday, Republicans in the Texas Senate narrowly acquitted Paxden,
*  amid intense pressure from national conservatives, including threats to run primary challenges
*  against any Republican senator who supported Paxden's impeachment.
