# Two Superpowers Walk Into a Garden
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17_oi1KNT0k)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  We begin tonight with a critical event for President Biden.
*  This week, one of the most highly anticipated diplomatic events of the year took place in
*  a mansion outside San Francisco.
*  President Biden has a high-stakes summit today with China's Xi Jinping.
*  Where President Biden and Xi Jinping of China met to repair their country's relations.
*  This is the first time they are meeting, the first time they are even talking in a year.
*  Which had sunk to one of the lowest points since they were established in 1972.
*  With the world watching, a lot is riding on this meeting with the nation's biggest rival.
*  Today, my colleague Edward Wong, on the effort to bring the relationship back from the brink.
*  It's Friday, November 17th.
*  So Ed, we've been talking to you throughout this year about the world's most important
*  relationship.
*  And that is the relationship between the United States and China.
*  And this week, there was a breakthrough of sorts.
*  President Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met on Wednesday in the United States.
*  So help us understand what was at stake here.
*  Well, Sabrina, this is the first time that Xi Jinping has come to the United States since
*  2017.
*  And these two leaders are the heads of nations that are the preeminent economic and military
*  powers in the world right now.
*  But these days, what we're seeing is that the military dimension of the relationship
*  is starting to overshadow the economic ties.
*  The US is constantly telling us about the rapid expansion of China's military, its growth.
*  And on Beijing's side, they see the US as a power that wants to have unfettered military
*  access throughout the Asia Pacific.
*  So what you're saying is that they are perhaps slowly, but steadily becoming military rivals.
*  That's right.
*  What I'm hearing from President Biden and his aides is that the US and China really
*  need to have high level diplomacy to figure out what guardrails to put on the relationship
*  so that they don't end up in an armed conflict.
*  OK, so that's the global security stakes of this meeting, which are quite substantial.
*  That's right.
*  It's a very fraught backdrop.
*  Many countries in the world see the relationship between the US and China as the one in the
*  world that could affect economies and even the military development of other countries.
*  And a lot of people who've been watching the relationship closely say it had reached an
*  all time low.
*  We, of course, have talked a lot on the show, you and I, Ed, about China's relationship
*  with the US and how it has soured.
*  So if we were to go back and remind people what all has happened to lead up to this moment,
*  where would you begin?
*  What is the moment you would start to help us understand that?
*  Well, things were already very bad before Biden came into the office because the relations
*  had entered a downward spiral during the Trump era.
*  And then when Biden came in, Chinese officials really thought things might improve.
*  But Biden continued to take a confrontational approach towards China.
*  And then there were things outside his control that really made things worse.
*  So one of the biggest flash points that took place in US-China relations was when Nancy
*  Pelosi, the House speaker, decided to visit Taiwan in August of 2022.
*  And the House speaker, one of the highest ranking officials in the US, visiting Taiwan,
*  is a big deal, something that President Biden had said he didn't want to happen.
*  And remind me, Ed, why that was such an inflammatory thing?
*  Well, China sees Taiwan as a part of China, not as an independent government.
*  And so it doesn't want other countries to have diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
*  So then China took very aggressive military actions to retaliate against that.
*  It fired off missiles around the Taiwan Strait and also went further.
*  It broke off high level dialogues with the US, including military conversations that
*  were taking place between the top commanders of both countries.
*  And what does it mean exactly, Ed, to break off military dialogue?
*  Well, when you have two countries that have militaries as large as China and the US, and
*  when those countries are rivals, you really want to have strong lines of communication
*  between the military leaders.
*  The reason is because the militaries of these two countries might brush up against each
*  other in lots of different settings around the world.
*  And so you want leaders to be able to talk to each other to figure out what's happening
*  if a crisis starts to erupt.
*  And that could then end up preventing a larger armed conflict.
*  So in other words, they're trying to prevent the kind of misunderstanding that can lead
*  to conflict, which can happen when there's maximum suspicion and minimum communication
*  between two countries, right?
*  That's right.
*  So this is very important.
*  It became an established practice during the Cold War.
*  In that era, America and the Soviet Union had these very close lines of communication
*  among the militaries in order to prevent nuclear war.
*  The two militaries were operating all around the globe, and they wanted to make sure that
*  there wasn't a crisis that could expand, like the Cuban Missile Crisis, for example, that
*  could lead to nuclear confrontation.
*  Right, because our relationship with the Soviet Union was fundamentally one of two military
*  adversaries, right?
*  But we managed to avoid nuclear conflict through those back channels, what you're calling
*  military-to-military communication.
*  That's right.
*  So I think people understand that this is an important foundation to lay among rivals
*  of this size.
*  And US officials tell me that this is one of the most important things they can possibly
*  do with China.
*  They've been saying that military-to-military ties are fairly weak between the US and China,
*  and they're very concerned about this.
*  And what makes the American officials so anxious is that in recent years, the Chinese and American
*  militaries have been coming to closer and closer contact all across Asia.
*  This has been happening, for example, in the South China Sea, as Chinese vessels and
*  aircraft come into closer contact with American naval ships and American jets there.
*  And US officials tell me that as these militaries come into closer contact with each other,
*  they really need the leaders of the militaries to be talking quickly to each other, too,
*  to make sure that a crisis does not erupt.
*  So after China severs these military-to-military communications, what happens then?
*  Well, within a couple of months, President Biden announces a very ambitious policy towards
*  China, which is a restriction on exports of the most advanced microchips to China.
*  And China sees this as a huge provocation.
*  They see this as the US trying to limit China's economic growth and to really keep the country down.
*  So this is another big bump in the relationship.
*  Is there a point where the two sides try to reset, kind of have a cooling off period?
*  Well, President Biden and President Xi have an important meeting that November in Bali.
*  We begin with a landmark meeting between two of the world's most powerful leaders, President
*  Xi.
*  And they're meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit.
*  In today's meeting, I stand ready to talk candidly with my counterpart.
*  These two men had never met before in person as the leaders of their countries.
*  As you know, I'm committed to keeping the lines of communications open between you and
*  me personally, but our governments across the board because our two countries have so
*  much that we have an opportunity to deal with.
*  So the whole purpose of this meeting was for each leader to tell the other one that there
*  needed to be some foundation of stability in the relationship.
*  They wanted to be able to weather certain storms, like what happened with Nancy Pelosi
*  when she went to Taiwan.
*  They thought that this would be the start of an effort to really bring relations in
*  2023 back to a higher level.
*  But then as we know, of course, that gets tested pretty quickly with that strange Chinese
*  spy balloon floating over Montana in February.
*  You and I did an episode about that.
*  It was kind of unclear exactly what it was, whether the Chinese had wanted to send it.
*  But at any rate, the relationship is still on the rocks.
*  Right.
*  At the moment, Sabrina, US officials were trying to figure out whether Xi was the one
*  who had given the green light for this balloon to go over the US and that it just happened
*  that the Americans discovered it.
*  But then US intelligence agencies figured out that the balloon had drifted off course.
*  And then they also found out that Xi didn't know about the balloon, that it was a program
*  under the PLA, the Chinese military, and that Xi only found out about it after it come over
*  and that Xi even got furious at his generals for what happened.
*  Right.
*  I mean, I remember ending that episode thinking it was pretty crazy that this huge relationship
*  is blown off course by this little balloon.
*  Right.
*  And at the time, you said, you know, both countries really badly wanted to get to the
*  point where incidents like that did not paralyze them.
*  But it seemed unlikely at the time.
*  That's how we ended that episode.
*  So what gets these leaders back to the table?
*  What happens?
*  So the US and China decide to engage in this intense diplomatic scramble to really try
*  and get high level talks back on track.
*  And the US starts sending a series of senior Biden aides to China.
*  The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken's met with the Chinese foreign minister in Beijing.
*  In June, I went with Blinken when he made his visit finally to China.
*  It was his first visit as Secretary of State.
*  And then some other cabinet secretaries followed.
*  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will visit.
*  US climate envoy John Kerry is in Beijing.
*  Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo heading to China this weekend.
*  She's the fourth senior Biden administration official now to make the trip.
*  And then Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer met with Chinese President Xi Jinping even
*  decided to meet with Chuck Schumer, the senior Democrat in the Senate.
*  China President Xi Jinping welcomes California Governor Gavin Newsom.
*  And Gavin Newsom, the governor of California.
*  And I think what that really showed was that Xi himself really wanted to get the diplomacy
*  on a stable footing.
*  And while all this was going on, people in both capitals were wondering whether this
*  meant that Xi would decide to come to the United States at some point this fall and
*  meet with Biden.
*  I mean, I remember you and I were talking about this, right?
*  And it was kind of unclear whether he would.
*  The jury was out for quite a while.
*  Yeah, it wasn't quite certain.
*  Just a few weeks ago, US officials were telling me that the chances are probably 70-30 that
*  Xi would come.
*  And here in Washington, among the diplomatic press corps and the White House reporters,
*  we're all trying to decide whether to pack our bags to go to San Francisco for a meeting.
*  And then we finally got word last week that Xi was on his way.
*  And this is the meeting that people have been waiting for all throughout the year.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So what actually happens at this much anticipated meeting on Wednesday?
*  Bring us into the room.
*  Well, Sabrina, Xi Jinping flies into San Francisco and he and his convoy go south of the city
*  to a vast estate near the coast.
*  This is the Filoli estate, which is founded by a gold baron a century ago.
*  It's lush.
*  There's amazing trees all over the place.
*  And Xi pulls up in his Chinese-made red flag limousine at the door of the manor.
*  Ready, doors.
*  Ready, off.
*  And Biden then we'd see right there on the red carpet, they shake hands, and then they
*  walk together inside the estate.
*  And at 1130 or so...
*  This time of year, about a year and a day ago, we met in Bali.
*  The two deliver opening remarks.
*  I value our conversation because I think it's paramount that you and I understand each other
*  clearly, leader to leader, with no misconceptions or miscommunication.
*  Biden tells Xi that he's there to make sure that the two leaders and the two countries
*  have clear lines of communication, that they really understand each other's intentions.
*  We have to ensure that competition does not veer into conflict.
*  And we also have to manage it responsibly, that competition.
*  Mr. President, good morning.
*  And Xi tells Biden and the public...
*  China-U.S. relationship has never been smooth sailing over the past 50 years or more, and
*  it always faces problems of one kind or another.
*  Yet it has kept moving forward amid twists and turns.
*  That planet Earth is big enough for two superpowers.
*  I'm still of the view that major country competition is not the prevailing trend of current time.
*  And cannot solve the problems facing China and the United States or the world at large.
*  That the two can coexist and cooperate and they don't need to be rivals.
*  And one country's success is an opportunity for the other.
*  And I think what's interesting, Sabrina, when you listen to those two sets of remarks,
*  is that Xi doesn't even want to frame the U.S.-China relationship as a competition
*  or as a rivalry.
*  Whereas Biden is very explicit that they're engaged in competition.
*  And in a way, the two leaders are talking past each other, even in their public remarks.
*  Right. Biden actually seems to have the more hawkish position in these meetings,
*  if you're listening to public statements.
*  So what do we know then about what happens once they actually get into the room?
*  Well, Sabrina, both Biden and Xi talked about some of the big long-running issues between
*  the two nations, like Taiwan.
*  But both sides also affirmed that there were areas of cooperation that they could move forward on.
*  One of them was climate change.
*  They also said that China would try and limit the export of chemicals that are used to make fentanyl.
*  But I think what's more important is that the two leaders realized their governments
*  needed to establish rules of the rivalry.
*  And that they couldn't let things spin out of control.
*  Okay. So rules of this new rivalry we've been talking about.
*  What kinds of rules? What did they actually decide?
*  Well, I think one of the outcomes that everyone was hoping for was that the two
*  countries would reestablish high-level talks between their military commanders.
*  US officials have been working hard to try and get that reestablished.
*  And out of this meeting, both leaders agreed that that should happen.
*  So that communication channel is open again.
*  What else was on the table on the security front?
*  What other guardrails did they discuss?
*  Well, one thing that has surprised US officials is that Chinese officials seem more willing
*  to enter into talks over arms control.
*  Now, China had wanted to avoid doing this for a long time.
*  And I think that at this meeting, there were more encouraging signs
*  that Chinese officials were willing to do this.
*  And at arms control, obviously, famously, the United States did a lot of it with the Soviets.
*  Why is China asking for it exactly?
*  Well, China sees the US starting to build up its military alliances around the Asia Pacific.
*  And it sees the US trying to deploy more ballistic missiles all over the Asia Pacific region.
*  And the obvious purpose for that would be to aim those missiles at China in the event of war.
*  So the US is sending Tomahawk missiles to Japan, for example,
*  as a result of strengthening its alliances with Tokyo.
*  And so China is concerned about this.
*  It doesn't want more deployment of these missiles all around it.
*  And so it's willing to at least start engaging the US in possible arms control talks.
*  And the US is also very concerned.
*  US officials have been watching China's buildup of its nuclear arsenal for some months now.
*  Right now, it's the third ranking country in terms of number of nuclear warheads,
*  still far below US and Russia.
*  But it could quickly accelerate the growth of its arsenal.
*  But it sounds like from the Chinese perspective, the US is in fact the one with the dangerous
*  behavior. The Chinese are basically saying, hey, guys, you're telling us to put on this seatbelt,
*  observe the rules of the road.
*  But you guys are the ones that are driving the car 90 miles an hour.
*  China has long felt that way.
*  And it believes that US forces are the military aggressors in the Asia Pacific.
*  They think that the US Navy is pushing the boundaries of where it operates,
*  and that it's not respecting the limits that China is trying to set in the region there.
*  It strikes me that Xi, in a lot of ways, kind of looks like the peacemaker here.
*  I mean, he's presenting himself as above the fray and saying, hey, we really want to put the
*  brakes on this. We don't see this relationship as a confrontation.
*  Well, this is something that China has been trying to push forward in the world for some months now.
*  It wants China and Xi to look like these are the adults in the room.
*  Xi wants to make it look like he's the one who's trying to keep everything on a stable
*  footing with the United States.
*  He wants it to make it look like the US is the aggressor in the relationship.
*  And it's consistent with the way they've approached some other conflicts around the world.
*  China has often called for peace talks in Ukraine.
*  It's now calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza war.
*  And so it likes to present this image of itself as the main diplomatic force that's
*  countering greater aggression by the US.
*  So how does this meeting wrap up? How does it end?
*  Well, the two sides talked with each other for two hours at that long table in the manor.
*  And then Biden and Xi went off to have a two-hour lunch meeting in a much smaller setting.
*  And they ate chicken as well as rice pilaf and some other California specialties.
*  Doesn't seem very elegant for dinner for the Chinese leader, but what are you going to do?
*  Right.
*  Okay. So stepping back and looking at this meeting with a little bit of hindsight, Ed,
*  how should I understand what happened here?
*  I mean, we started off this conversation talking about how the US and China are
*  really transitioning to a new kind of relationship, this kind of military rivalry.
*  Where are we in the arc of that transition?
*  And how do we understand this meeting in that context?
*  Well, Sabrina, I think we're somewhere maybe in the middle of that arc.
*  The dynamic started a few years ago and it's accelerating now.
*  China's military buildup is frightening many US officials and that won't end anytime soon.
*  And the US intends to maintain its military dominance of the Asia-Pacific.
*  Those two things are incompatible.
*  And I think what we'll see is further crisis points in the road ahead.
*  When they talk about reaching agreement on certain small things like fentanyl,
*  that's just to try and maintain a certain level of stability in the relationship.
*  But on the big issues like Taiwan, like which military gets dominance of the region,
*  these are huge questions that both countries haven't tackled yet in any satisfactory manner.
*  And I think that it'll be hard for both of them to address these issues in a diplomatic setting.
*  So you're saying in a lot of important ways, this didn't actually lower the temperature that much.
*  Perhaps this is more like a temporary pause in what is likely to be an overall declining relationship.
*  Right. I wouldn't even call it a pause, Sabrina.
*  I would say that I think both sides probably accept the direction the relationship is going
*  at this point, but that they realize they need to maintain communications.
*  And that was the bar that Biden and his aides set for us
*  when they briefed us on these talks before they began.
*  They set a very low bar saying all they wanted to do was maintain some level of communication.
*  But Ed, I guess thinking about this meeting and you're telling me about it,
*  what I would say is at least they now have some seat belts, right?
*  It's potentially not quite as dangerous.
*  Do we have a sense of how Xi is really seeing this?
*  Well, we know that Xi has made a lot of public remarks
*  in which he's really pointed to aggressive moves by the U.S.
*  This year, for example, he said for the first time in a setting that the U.S. is trying to contain
*  China. They see the U.S. is trying to implant its rules and its institutions around the world,
*  whether it's through the trade deals and negotiates or whether it's through
*  American dominance in the United Nations or the World Bank, for example, and that all of these
*  rules are set to try and limit the growth of other superpowers. So when the U.S. officials
*  talk about what they call a rules-based international order, Chinese officials,
*  Russian officials, and many others see this as U.S. attempts to keep other countries down.
*  So Chinese officials are essentially saying, okay, you want rules, but whose rules? They're
*  effectively your rules. We want to set our own.
*  Exactly, Sabrina. I think what we're going to see coming up in the months ahead is that
*  China will increasingly push to set those rules and that this is another area of confrontation
*  between the two nations.
*  Ed, thank you.
*  Thanks, Sabrina.
*  After the meeting on Wednesday, Biden was asked at a news conference
*  whether he still thought that Xi Jinping was a dictator. He said that he did.
*  Later that night, at a dinner with business executives, the Chinese leader seemed intent
*  on presenting himself as a willing partner. He said, quote,
*  The number one question for us is, are we adversaries or are we friends? And he added,
*  China is ready to be a partner and a friend of the United States.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. On Thursday, a day after it took control of
*  Shifa Hospital, the largest hospital in the Gaza Strip, the Israeli military was still
*  searching the site for evidence to prove its claim that the hospital concealed a secret Hamas
*  base. The claim that Hamas operated from within the sprawling hospital complex has been central
*  to Israel's defense of its military campaign in Gaza, which is now said to have killed more
*  than 11,000 people. The military has yet to present documentation of a network of tunnels,
*  but Israel released several videos to bolster its case. One on Thursday of what it said was a tunnel
*  that was used by Hamas. However, it was unclear from the video what purpose the passageway served
*  or how far it extended. Another video showed about a dozen guns, a grenade, protective vests,
*  and military uniforms it said its soldiers had found within an MRI unit at the hospital.
*  The Times could not verify the provenance of the weapons. A Hamas spokesman on Thursday accused
*  Israel of planting them. The United States, for its part, said on Thursday that it believed that
*  Hamas had been using the complex as a base. And a jury convicted David DePapp of federal crimes
*  for breaking into the home of Representative Nancy Pelosi in October of 2022 and bludgeoning
*  her husband Paul with a hammer. According to testimony at trial, DePapp became obsessed with
*  right-wing conspiracy theories and embraced the dehumanizing language about Nancy Pelosi that
*  conservative pundits and politicians have used for years. The attack raised fears about political
*  violence ahead of last year's midterm elections. DePapp faces the possibility of decades in prison.
*  Today's episode was produced by Shannon Lynn, Luke Vanderplug, and Sydney Harper. It was edited by
*  M.J. Davis Lynn with help from Brendan Klinkenberg, contains original music by Marian Lozano and Dan
*  Powell, and was engineered by Alyssa Moxley. Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Lansferk
*  of Wonderland. That's it for the Daily. I'm Sabrina Tavernisi. See you on Monday.
