# The Sunday Read: ‘The Agony of Putting Your Life on Hold to Care for Your Parents’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4dwZ1W1A04)
*  Hi, my name is Jaya Lee and I'm a contributing writer for the New York Times Magazine.
*  I wrote a story, which you'll hear in this week's Sunday Read, about the growing number
*  of young people who are becoming caregivers for their parents.
*  The story is definitely not about me, but in some profound ways, I do see myself in
*  it.
*  So for the whole time my husband and I were dating, which was like 11 years, I knew that
*  his mother had serious health issues.
*  But that said, she mostly managed, and she lived relatively independently in her own
*  place.
*  Then came 2018.
*  I was 32 years old.
*  My husband, who was still my boyfriend at that time, and I were coming home from a vacation
*  in Japan when he got a call saying that his mom was in the hospital.
*  We went to stay with her after she was discharged.
*  She was weak and needed help in the middle of the night.
*  While we were there, someone known as an end-of-life planner came to visit.
*  We knew nothing about what an end-of-life planner did.
*  But there we were, jet lagged, half asleep, suddenly needing to make major decisions about
*  power of attorney and life support.
*  That was the day my husband turned to me and said, I don't think mom can live on her own
*  anymore.
*  I remember feeling instantly overwhelmed.
*  We're both self-employed.
*  We had just moved into our first apartment together, thinking it'd be the two of us.
*  But we set up an air mattress and took in my husband's mother and tried to get her
*  back to stability.
*  It took months.
*  With our help, she was able to continue living in her own apartment.
*  But two years later, in the thick of the pandemic, she had a heart episode.
*  This time, we moved in with her.
*  Because of COVID, everything we needed to keep ourselves safe, to keep food and medicine
*  in the house, to keep up doctor's visits, all of that got so much harder.
*  And I can remember how isolated we felt because none of our friends were going through this.
*  We had to juggle our caregiving duties while working from home.
*  So our whole situation sort of crept out while I was speaking to colleagues.
*  And I also saw parallels to my situation on the news.
*  Stories about the chronic caregiver shortage and daycare and senior care centers shutting
*  down.
*  One day, my editor and I started talking about what all this meant for people who had both
*  kids and aging parents.
*  I began looking on Facebook groups for caregivers for people around my age, and I was shocked
*  to see how many there were.
*  It's weird to say this, but that was the first time I really understood that I was
*  one of them, a family caregiver.
*  Scrolling through postings, there were people carrying toddlers on their shoulders, desperate
*  just to get some playtime outside, only they're also pushing wheelchairs.
*  One person mentioned needing to lock away the refrigerator in the garage so that their
*  father with dementia wouldn't get to the food in the middle of the night.
*  Many of these caregivers are part of what's known as the sandwich generation.
*  They're taking care of their aging parents while also raising kids.
*  Forty or so years ago, these caregivers were mostly people in their 50s, when you might
*  be close to retirement and in a financially stable position.
*  And it often referred to women.
*  But what's happened over the decades is that this demographic has gotten younger and younger.
*  The share of caregivers who are under 45 quintupled over the past two decades, as their parents,
*  many of them baby boomers, are living longer, but with more health complications and less
*  financial security than the generation before them.
*  Today's sandwich generation is much more likely to be someone in their 40s or 30s or
*  even in their 20s.
*  I wanted to really get inside the toll that this life can take on someone when it hits
*  them at such an early age.
*  And that's when I found a woman named Randy Schofield.
*  Randy was like me in her 30s, but she was also a single mom.
*  She had recently made a big decision to switch careers and start a business, something she
*  dreamed about doing.
*  But around the same time, her father, Keith, got into a really horrible accident.
*  That day changed everything for Randy.
*  Randy took it upon herself to move in with him so she could help him get better.
*  She thought it would be temporary that Keith would eventually get better and go home.
*  But as we see in this story, that doesn't end up happening.
*  My husband and I no longer live with my mother-in-law, but now, with help from my parents, we've
*  continued to give her daily care.
*  It's been fulfilling in a lot of ways, but I also know how easy it is to lose your sense
*  of self while caring for an aging parent.
*  Many of us do it because we feel we don't have a choice.
*  And that was certainly true for both me and Randy.
*  So here's my article, The Agony of Putting Your Life on Hold to Care for Your Parents,
*  read by Robin Miles.
*  Randy Schofield tried her best to not dwell on all the ways her life changed, on the pieces
*  of herself that got lost in the shuffle.
*  She was a 34-year-old single mother who not long ago was in the throes of a big life transition.
*  She had left her full-time job of eight years as a personal bailiff to a local judge.
*  She was burned out, ready for something new.
*  She pulled $30,000 from her retirement savings and was planning to give herself all of 2022
*  to expand the small catering business she had always dreamed about.
*  This would be the year she bet on herself.
*  It was risky, but she had a plan.
*  She applied for part-time, remote office jobs so she could keep up with the bills, maybe
*  save up for a summer vacation with her two daughters, Alicia, then 13, and Amira, who
*  was 15.
*  She felt guilty for having spent so much of her time working at the courthouse or on call
*  by her laptop.
*  She started going to bed early and updated her budget every two weeks.
*  She got the girls ready to begin the spring semester feeling like a new person.
*  Then, in late January 2022, she received the news that medics were pulling her father out
*  of his car.
*  Randy's father, Keith Schofield, then 61, had been driving home from the gym after a
*  snowstorm when a car in the next lane lost control and sent Keith's Chevy over a Cleveland
*  freeway overpass.
*  The collision splintered the bone in his left thigh down to his knee.
*  Three days later, a metal rod held the broken pieces together.
*  Until his leg recovered from the surgery, he would not be able to walk without assistance.
*  In hindsight, there were warning signs that her father's health could upend Randy's
*  life, the heart episodes that landed him in the emergency room almost every year, the
*  medicine bottles that he swore he took on time.
*  But he was also youthful and spirited, and it was easy to believe that everything was
*  fine, that he was fine, and that if she were to take care of him some day, it would be
*  occasional and in a distant future where she had more of life figured out.
*  She didn't see this day coming the way it did, so abruptly and so soon.
*  But increasing numbers of adult children are taking care of their parents, often shouldering
*  the burden with no pay and little outside help, making their meals, helping them shower,
*  bandaging their wounds, and holding them up before they can fall.
*  The number of people living in nursing homes or assisted living facilities make up less
*  than 5% of the population 65 and older.
*  In its most recent survey of unpaid caregivers published in 2020, AARP found that there were
*  nearly 42 million people caring for an aging friend or family member, more than tenfold
*  the number in 1989.
*  The fastest growth is happening among younger generations.
*  The share of caregivers who are under 45 quintupled over the past two decades to nearly 66% from
*  16% as their parents, many of the 72 million baby boomers, are living longer but doing
*  so with more chronic diseases and disability and less means than the generation before
*  them.
*  I always knew what would happen, says Adrienne Glassman, who at 29 took care of her mother
*  in the final decade of her life and now hosts the podcast Young Life Interrupted.
*  But it happened 30 years sooner for me than I ever anticipated.
*  And since the pandemic, as caregivers available for hire became rarer and impossibly expensive,
*  the estimated number of unpaid family members who have stepped in nearly doubled.
*  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in early 2021 that 34.1% of Americans
*  older are either caring for an adult or juggling the care of both adults and children.
*  In another poll, 60% of first-time caregivers were millennials or Gen Z.
*  An unprecedented number of people in their 30s and to a lesser degree 20s are entering
*  what the social work scholar Dorothy A. Miller once called a peculiar position in the modern
*  American nuclear family between the care they give to their aging parent and to their
*  children.
*  Today's sandwich generation is younger than the version Miller described four decades
*  ago, but they face the same unique set of unshared stresses that she warned of then.
*  Acute financial strain, a lack of reciprocated support, and fatigue from fulfilling the demands
*  of too many roles.
*  Following her father's accident, Randy postponed the start date of her new part-time remote
*  office job so she could look after him as he recovered from surgery in the intensive
*  care unit.
*  For weeks, she held his hand and prayed.
*  In March, when her father left an outpatient rehab center and moved in with her, she pushed
*  back the start date of the part-time job again.
*  Randy, her sisters and brother-in-law, moved most of the furniture out of her room to make
*  space for an extra-wide hospital bed, a leather recliner, and a commode.
*  Randy took over Alicia's bedroom across the narrow hall.
*  At night, she could hear the hissing of her father's oxygen tank in one room and her
*  daughters bickering over their shared space in the other.
*  Randy's days filled up with a series of small but life-dependent tasks, emptying her father's
*  portable toilet and urinals every few hours, handing him a shot glass of medications,
*  8 a.m., 4 p.m., 8 p.m., measuring his blood pressure morning and night, driving him to
*  and from doctor's appointments at least twice per week.
*  The trauma of her father's leg injury accelerated his chronic heart and kidney disease, causing
*  his body to retain water, which meant he could have only six cups of fluid a day.
*  Randy kept a log of how much he drank and urinated in a red spiral-bound notebook.
*  The time she once planned for herself disappeared.
*  Her aspirations faded.
*  She eventually gave up the job offer entirely and shut down the website for her catering
*  business.
*  The unemployment benefits she started receiving after leaving the courthouse job barely covered
*  the basics after her mortgage, property tax, car payment, insurance, water, gas, and garbage
*  bills.
*  Only $100 remained, and soon those checks would run out, too.
*  The savings Randy pulled from retirement after quitting her job were supposed to last
*  her into the next year, so she watched her spending carefully.
*  There were unforeseen necessities, repairs for the furnace for one, and after her father
*  moved in, the list grew, compression socks to help his blood circulation, a shower bench,
*  nitrile gloves, trash bags for the portable toilet, Lysol wipes, extra-strength Tylenol.
*  Amira was accepted into summer programs at Brown and then Howard, which made Randy proud
*  but also stressed because it meant she needed to buy round-trip flights and a few nights
*  in a hotel.
*  She stopped paying her bills on the first of the month as she was used to doing.
*  Instead, she leaned on grace periods, paying the minimum balance to avoid triggering a
*  late penalty.
*  Keith was a youth basketball coach and worked as a county social worker for 13 years.
*  Two years before the accident, he retired and received $2,000 each month from his public
*  employee pension, part of which paid for his rent.
*  He insisted that he would return to his one-bedroom apartment as soon as his leg recovered.
*  The benefits put Keith over the income limit required to receive federal financial assistance
*  for long-term in-home care, which could essentially pay Randy a minimum wage for looking after
*  him.
*  Most American households make too little to afford a hired caregiver or a bed in a nursing
*  home, the median costs of which are about $3,000 and $8,500 a month, respectively.
*  Yet most Americans also make too much to qualify for the public benefits that exist for this
*  very reason.
*  The price of long-term care, meanwhile, has risen for nearly two decades in a row.
*  In 2019, the average cost of in-home care for one year equaled 80% of the median household
*  income for seniors.
*  A year in a nursing home cost more than two times the median income.
*  The result is a kind of generational compounding effect for family caregivers inheriting the
*  financial burdens of their parents while facing their own precarious future.
*  In AARP's survey, about a quarter of family caregivers reported that they stopped saving
*  or that they went deeper into debt.
*  Nearly a fifth reported they paid bills late or stopped paying altogether.
*  3% filed for bankruptcy.
*  Millennials, according to a 2018 AARP report, spent a higher share of their incomes on caregiving
*  than previous generations while earning less on average.
*  A majority juggled a full-time job with their care duties and earned less than $50,000 per year.
*  They were also more likely to receive warnings from employers about performance or attendance,
*  turn down promotions, quit, or be fired.
*  Amy Goyer, an author and an expert on caregiving for AARP, decided to move in with her parents
*  in 2012 when they required 24-hour attention and could no longer afford their mounting
*  medical and living expenses.
*  They had been paying $4,000 per month at an independent living community and a mortgage
*  on the house they bought in the 1980s, which drained her father's pension and the social
*  security that both parents received.
*  Her sisters helped out, but Goyer absorbed most of the work and expenses.
*  She maxed out her credit cards.
*  She hired help during the day so she could continue her full-time job and took over on
*  nights and weekends.
*  I provided 60 to 80 hours a week of care myself, and it was still so expensive, Goyer said.
*  After her parents died, Goyer filed for bankruptcy.
*  According to AARP's latest data, Goyer said, one in three caregivers has no other help.
*  How are they doing that?
*  She asked.
*  They're either not working or they're just about killing themselves.
*  Randy was not, strictly speaking, alone.
*  Early in her father's recovery, her mother and two younger sisters were hands-on, coming
*  over several times a week to drop off food, help him practice walking, or take the girls
*  to the mall.
*  Randy's parents divorced when she was a teenager, but remained close.
*  On a few occasions when her father was still in the hospital, they even took turns filling
*  in for Randy overnight so that she could catch up on sleep.
*  Their group thread buzzed with inspirational quotes and memes and schedules and eye rolls
*  over Keith's refusing to take his medicine when they asked him to.
*  Gradually though, the visits and texts slowed.
*  A series of disagreements distanced Randy from her mother and sisters.
*  Randy's mother told me that one of their first arguments started when Keith was still
*  in the hospital.
*  She worried that taking care of him would overwhelm Randy and felt that he should instead
*  be looked after by medical professionals while the family helped.
*  But Randy refused.
*  During her father's brief stay in the rehab facility, she said staff members failed to
*  treat his fluid retention, which ultimately resulted in another trip to the hospital.
*  When Randy's mother learned that Keith was in a relationship, she no longer felt it was
*  her place to be by his side.
*  Keith's girlfriend, Jackie DeVilla, a former nursing home administrator, dropped in regularly
*  to help him shower and accompany him to doctor's appointments.
*  She and Randy moved in sync when helping Keith to and from the car, but Jackie's support
*  could feel fragile at times.
*  She juggled a full-time job managing cancer patients and also checked in on her own ailing
*  family members.
*  On nights when she left after an argument with Keith, Randy could only hope she would
*  return before too much time passed.
*  Randy also had a boyfriend, D'Amonte Cummings, who was 28 and worked as a truck driver.
*  On his days off, he came over with his eight-year-old son, an expressive, inquisitive third grader,
*  to watch football with Keith or take the girls shopping.
*  The girls lit up when they were around.
*  When big D'Amonte was on the road, little D'Amonte sometimes stayed with Randy for
*  a week or more.
*  In a pioneering study of adult children caregivers, the social worker Elaine Brody found that
*  in every family in which an aging parent required care, there was usually one burden bearer,
*  a single member who bore the brunt of the responsibilities, even when there were, in
*  theory, others who could help.
*  This phenomenon appears with striking regularity and frequency.
*  Brody co-wrote in the journal Family Process in 1966, the burden bearer could be patient
*  and self-sacrificing, but also bitter.
*  In a later study of sandwiched caregivers with siblings, Brody found that the burden
*  bearer was more likely to report symptoms of depression, restlessness, and feelings
*  of isolation and missing out.
*  In a later study of sandwiched caregivers with siblings, Brody found that the burden
*  bearer was more likely to report symptoms of depression, restlessness, and feelings
*  of isolation and missing out.
*  In a later study of sandwiched caregivers with siblings, published in 2003, two-thirds
*  reported an inequitable spread of labor and feeling considerable distress as a result.
*  One woman told researchers that her sisters helped somewhat.
*  One flew in for a week out of the year and the other helped with finances, but there
*  are still times when it just pisses me off royally.
*  Women remain the majority of family caregivers today, although among millennials,
*  the share of men is closer to half.
*  Two months after Keith moved in with Randy, his ankles swelled like water balloons,
*  a common side effect of a heart that doesn't pump hard enough and a kidney that is malfunctioning.
*  Randy took him to the hospital where he was hooked up to an IV drip of a diuretic to drain
*  the fluid out of his body.
*  That week, a heart failure specialist delivered some sobering news.
*  Without a major intervention, Keith might only have six months to a year left to live.
*  The doctor recommended a cardiac ablation, a procedure in which a surgeon burns scar
*  tissue in your heart to block irregular electrical signals.
*  If it succeeded and his arrhythmia improved, the doctor would recommend him for a heart
*  and kidney transplant.
*  At the next family cookout, Randy snapped at her youngest sister for
*  not helping their father move inside when it began to rain.
*  Everyone started arguing.
*  Randy cursed out her mother and sisters and stormed out.
*  The tension festered.
*  One day, Randy walked by her father's room and overheard him telling someone on the phone
*  that his other daughters didn't come around as much as he did.
*  Did he think that she enjoyed seeing him sick?
*  Watching him every morning slumped in his recliner, waiting for his chest to rise?
*  Randy resented how the rift in the family made her daughters feel like collateral damage.
*  She blamed herself, too.
*  She was so occupied with her father's recovery and keeping up with bills that she hadn't
*  taken the girls to a movie or the mall.
*  Randy was so upset that he didn't want to see her again.
*  That she hadn't taken the girls to a movie or the mall in months.
*  She knew they were trying their best to adapt.
*  Amira often stuck around the kitchen asking if Randy needed any help.
*  Alicia withdrew to her bed and into her phone.
*  As the heart procedure approached, Randy tried to be optimistic, but she had so many questions.
*  What were the chances it would succeed?
*  When could he start physical therapy again?
*  She wrote them in her red notebook and took it to a meeting with her father's cardiologist,
*  but her father stopped her before she could ask.
*  Randy knew he was probably anxious about the risks, but she felt she deserved some answers.
*  Would the doctor's appointment slow down or speed up?
*  When could she start looking for work?
*  She needed to start saving again soon.
*  In the spring, she would have to take Amira to visit colleges.
*  How much longer would she be on call?
*  That summer, as the bills stacked up, Randy and Domonte decided to move in together.
*  There was barely enough space for two more in the house, but it was hard to ignore the
*  upsides of splitting the bills.
*  He became the one person she could share her unfiltered thoughts with about the sense that
*  her life was on permanent pause, that she was wasting away, the doubt and guilt and
*  anger that weighed her down.
*  Keith made it through the procedure, but his recovery was slow and unsteady.
*  His weight could climb nine pounds in two days, a sign that his body could be retaining
*  Then drop below his normal range, a sign that his kidneys could be failing.
*  Randy felt uneasy each time she left him alone in the house.
*  She kept the front door unlocked in case someone needed to get inside,
*  a neighbor, Jackie, paramedics.
*  The days were relentless and disjointed.
*  Now with three children in school and on different schedules,
*  Randy drove between two and three hours every weekday.
*  Big Domonte started a new job trucking long distance, which paid more,
*  but required him to be away for most of the week.
*  Numbers and to do lists ran through Randy's mind.
*  At night, she had trouble sleeping.
*  Relatives and friends cheered her on, saying things like, I don't know how you do it,
*  Randy, and I'm praying for you, Randy.
*  She appreciated the sentiment, but she didn't want sympathy.
*  She wanted someone to take her place.
*  She didn't always notice her mood dip until one of the children picked up on her
*  impatient tone.
*  Why did you say it like that, little Domonte asked her one time.
*  Often, she pulled into her driveway after school drop offs or errands and
*  just sat there, the engine still running.
*  More than once, she walked out of her house and hid behind her car,
*  crying out of sight until Amira came out looking for her.
*  Of all the challenges that a family caregiver faces,
*  the emotional toll has been consistently documented as the most pervasive and
*  severe.
*  A widely cited review of 30 empirical studies published between 1985 and
*  1998 found that the risk of psychiatric morbidity was high among caregivers,
*  especially for women.
*  More recent studies have found that caregiver distress and
*  depression were often followed by changes in physical health
*  that ultimately lead to illness and possibly to death,
*  though the precise causes were unclear.
*  The 2021 CDC survey of more than 10,000 family caregivers
*  found more troubling trends.
*  About 70% of respondents said that they experienced adverse mental health
*  symptoms within the previous month, including anxiety,
*  depression, or suicidal ideation.
*  Among people who cared for both their children and parents,
*  about half reported experiencing suicidal thoughts.
*  Randy's own breakdowns began six months after her father moved in.
*  One weary night in September, she waited until everyone had gone to bed,
*  then sneaked out to her car and drove away.
*  She called Demonte and told him she couldn't be there anymore,
*  that she worried she would become a danger to herself and others.
*  Demonte called several family members and the police.
*  Then he, Jackie, and Randy's middle sister, Megan Crespo, rushed to the house.
*  They had a right to panic.
*  At 21, Randy was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and
*  checked into a hospital several times after her daughters were born.
*  It had been years since her last breakdown.
*  Therapy and meditation were helping her manage her mental health.
*  She was sorry for alarming everyone that day in September, but
*  she knew it would be worse to hold in what she felt.
*  She did not want to live this life anymore.
*  She had been sitting outside her father's apartment for
*  what felt like ten minutes when Amira called, worried about her and
*  the officers knocking at the door.
*  The police were gone by the time Randy returned home.
*  A few weeks later, Megan called the police again.
*  Two officers pulled up to find Randy sitting in her car sobbing.
*  She tried not to, but
*  Randy thought often about how this chapter of her life might end.
*  In the best but least probable scenario, her father would recover and go home.
*  Perhaps she would go back to school and
*  become a nurse, turn all this new knowledge into a job.
*  Maybe in a few years after the girls left for college,
*  she would sell the house and leave Cleveland,
*  just her and the D'Amantes somewhere warm by the water.
*  In these daydreams, she found a fleeting semblance of escape,
*  of possibility, but also of guilt for imagining a future without her father.
*  If God forbid he was to die, she wanted to mourn him without resentment.
*  By January, one year after the accident,
*  Randy applied for part-time jobs again, and
*  she enrolled in a local nursing program.
*  Her father's recovery stagnated.
*  A second leg surgery helped him avoid an infection, but
*  he was weaker than ever and lost nearly 20 pounds.
*  That month, Randy broke down again.
*  Alicia texted her grandmother to say Randy needed her.
*  The next day, Randy's mother came over.
*  They talked for a while.
*  She also had some news.
*  She was recently diagnosed with stage one breast cancer.
*  They caught it early, thankfully.
*  She was heading to see the doctor that week to find out her treatment plan.
*  Randy decided to go with her.
*  Her mother would need daily radiation and eventually hormone therapy.
*  But she was well enough to manage on her own, at least for now.
