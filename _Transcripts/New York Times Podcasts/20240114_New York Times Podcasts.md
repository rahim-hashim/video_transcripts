# The Sunday Read: ‘How an Ordinary Football Game Turns Into the Most Spectacular Thing on TV’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDB6K8M_rN0)
*  I'm Jody Rosen and I'm a contributing writer for the New York Times Magazine.
*  Every week, tens of millions of people in the United States watch football, including
*  me.
*  I watch football at home with my kid.
*  I watch it alone.
*  I watch it under the covers at night on my cell phone.
*  It's just an incredibly entertaining way to lose yourself for three hours.
*  And I've always been interested in the fact that football is so popular with such a broad
*  swath of Americans.
*  It's not just, you know, white guys in their man cave, but every kind of person on the
*  demographic spectrum.
*  But I was also interested in the artifice of televised football.
*  The idea that a TV broadcast isn't just a kind of unmediated document of a game unfolding
*  in real time, but in many ways a crafted television entertainment product.
*  In big picture terms, it means who wins and who loses, of course.
*  But it's also all the little details that make up that larger story.
*  It's the dramatist personae, the coaches on either sideline, the owners of the teams who
*  are in the luxury suites, all the different star players.
*  Once I began to focus as a viewer on the technical aspects of the storytelling, I grew curious
*  about the vast labor force that's behind the spectacle of televised football.
*  So this week's Sunday Read is my recent feature for the magazine about prime time television's
*  number one show for over a decade, NBC's Sunday Night Football.
*  In 2022, 83 of the top 100 most watched television broadcasts of the year were NFL games.
*  And the most popular prime time show, by far, is Sunday Night Football.
*  To report this story, I sat in on off-season meetings with the makers of Sunday Night Football.
*  They're meticulous planners looking ahead to each individual game on their schedule
*  and plotting various storylines.
*  But the most exciting part of my reporting was when I attended the very first game of
*  the NFL season, spending time on the field, in the broadcast booth, and in the NBC Sports
*  production truck where the producers and directors actually pull off this vast symphonic broadcast.
*  In front of us was a giant wall of 200 different video feeds that the producers and directors
*  were facing during the broadcast, making split-second decisions about which images
*  are going to go up on air.
*  As the game is unfolding, they might be giving instructions to instant replay directors or
*  camera operators, speaking to the various statisticians and researchers, or crucially
*  communicating with the announcers in the booth.
*  The fact that they're able to assemble this collage of images in real time while simultaneously
*  conducting conversations with the cacophony of voices in their headsets, choreographing
*  a show that's seamless and exciting, it was kind of mind-blowing.
*  So here's my article, Behind the Scenes of the Most Spectacular Show on TV, read by Robert
*  Petkoff.
*  Our audio producer is Jack DiSidoro.
*  The original music for this episode was written and performed by Aaron Esposito.
*  Arrowhead Stadium, the home of the Kansas City Chiefs, the NFL's defending champions,
*  is a very loud place.
*  Players say that when the noise reaches top volume, they can feel vibrations in their
*  bones.
*  During a 2014 game, a sound meter captured a decibel reading equivalent to a jet's taking
*  off, earning a Guinness World Record for loudest crowd roar at a sports stadium.
*  Chiefs fans know how to weaponize noise, quieting to a church-like hush when the team's great
*  quarterback Patrick Mahomes calls signals, but then, when opponents have the ball, unleashing
*  a howl that can even drown out the sound of the play call crackling through the speaker
*  inside the rival quarterback's helmet.
*  There are others whose work is complicated by the din.
*  Around 11 a.m. on Thursday, September 7th, Brian Melillo, an audio engineer for NBC Sports'
*  flagship NFL telecast Sunday Night Football, arrived at Arrowhead to prepare for that evening's
*  Chiefs-Detroit Lions game.
*  It was a big occasion.
*  The annual season opener, the NFL kickoff game, traditionally hosted by the winner of
*  last season's Super Bowl.
*  There would be speeches, fireworks, a military flyover, the unfurling of a championship banner.
*  A crowd of more than 73,000 was expected.
*  Arrowhead is a pretty rowdy setting, Melillo said.
*  It can present some problems.
*  Melillo was especially concerned about his crowd mics.
*  Three stereo microphones intended to catch the ambient ooze and oz of fans mounted atop
*  16-foot-high painter's poles that he and a colleague had secured to the railing separating
*  the seats from the field.
*  These needed to be kept at a distance from exploding pyrotechnics and angled away from
*  the glare of the stadium's public address system.
*  A perhaps greater hazard was overzealous fans who are prone to shaking the poles or
*  even pulling them down.
*  You'll get people who have been tailgating for five hours, Melillo said.
*  I might have to bribe some people to stay off those poles.
*  Melillo and his microphones were part of a huge deployment of personnel and equipment
*  descending on Arrowhead that morning.
*  Broadcasting a football game on live television is one of the most complex technical and
*  logistical challenges in entertainment.
*  The task is magnified in the case of Sunday Night Football, which is known for sparing
*  no expense to deliver the most comprehensive coverage and the most arresting spectacles.
*  For the kickoff game, one of three 2023 regular season broadcasts by the SNF team that do
*  not take place on Sunday, an NBC Sports workforce of 200 traveled to Kansas City.
*  A convoy of 10 trucks made the trip.
*  Four mobile production units, an office truck, a generator in case power went down, a truck
*  for the Football Night in America pre-game show, and three haulers packed with sets,
*  cranes and dozens of cameras.
*  There were handheld cameras, cameras that sit atop mobile sideline carts, robotic cameras
*  that record beauty shots of the stadium exterior, ultra-high resolution 4K cameras that yield
*  super slow motion replays.
*  Suspended from a web of fiber optic cables more than 120 feet in the air was Skycam,
*  ready to zipline over the field at up to 20 miles per hour.
*  Another camera would arrive later to provide a still loftier vantage point from a fixed-wing
*  aircraft.
*  Then there were the microphones.
*  There were mics mounted on many of the cameras.
*  There were six parabolic mics, contraptions resembling satellite dishes that operators
*  strap on like sandwich boards and schlep around the sidelines to soak up sounds.
*  The NFL is particular about what audio can air, no conversations on the bench allowed,
*  but for each game, the league mics up several offensive linemen, allowing broadcasters to
*  catch the quarterback grunting his cadence and the crunch of pads colliding after the snap.
*  The person responsible for the sonic personality of Sunday Night Football is Wendell Stevens,
*  the lead audio engineer.
*  That morning, Stevens was getting ready at his station, a 144-channel mixing console
*  in the show's main production truck.
*  What viewers might assume to be an unmediated flow of in-game audio is more like a live
*  DJ mix sculpted spontaneously by Stevens, who blends sounds from dozens of sources.
*  You don't want this constant roar and thunder, he said.
*  Football is a dynamic game in terms of sound.
*  He has other rules.
*  One is, you mustn't miss the doink, the percussive thump when an errant kick strikes the goalposts,
*  which resonate like a giant tuning fork.
*  Stevens was in the chair for NBC's broadcast of the 2018 Bears-Eagles wildcard playoff
*  which ended with a Bears field goal attempt that rebounded from the left upright to the
*  crossbar, an event that entered NFL lore as the double doink.
*  Stevens' core principle is that the voices of the play-by-play man Mike Tirico and the
*  analyst Chris Collinsworth must be boosted in the mix so they dominate even at moments
*  of peak sound and fury.
*  They are the stars of SNF, along with the sideline reporter Melissa Stark, who interviews
*  players and coaches and offers scuttlebutt during games.
*  But that on-air talent is supported by a vast unseen army in the packed broadcast booth
*  and the trucks.
*  Producers, directors, editors, graphics specialists, researchers, statisticians, spotters, and others.
*  By the afternoon, nearly every member of that team had arrived at Arrowhead and was
*  at work in the TV compound just outside the stadium gates.
*  There, in the control room of the A-unit truck, the coordinating producer Rob Hyland and the
*  director Drew Esikoff stood facing a wall of LCD monitors showing nearly 200 video feeds.
*  It was 3 p.m.
*  The production team had just finished the FACS, or Facilities Check, a lengthy run-through
*  when game elements are rehearsed and technical effects, the telestrator used to explicate
*  instant replays, the video overlay demarcating the line to gain, are tested.
*  Now it was time for a meeting with the camera crew.
*  Camera operators were given sheets containing headshots of coaching staffs, players' families,
*  anyone whose face they might be called upon to pick out on the sidelines or in the stands.
*  Action plans were distributed indicating which cameras would follow key players.
*  It's been 207 days since the Super Bowl, Hyland told the group.
*  Our country has been waiting for tonight, so let's make sure we capture the scene.
*  Let's give America a reason to stick around throughout the night.
*  The word America is bandied freely at SNF as a synonym for the show's audience.
*  It's partly an expression of the nationalism entrenched in football culture, the flags
*  and flyovers and patriotic hullabaloo that surrounds the NFL, but it is also a frank
*  acknowledgement of the stature of televised football in American life.
*  Football is by far the most popular thing on TV.
*  Last year, according to Nielsen, 83 of the 100 most viewed telecasts were NFL games,
*  including 19 of the top 20.
*  It's no exaggeration to say that television's continued existence as a purveyor of pre-scheduled
*  linear TV programming is predicated on football.
*  Year-over-year TV usage is crashing, says Anthony Krupi, a media reporter for the website
*  Sportico, but the NFL is trending up.
*  To keep growing, to increase your ratings by 5 or 6 percent when viewership as a whole
*  is down 10 percent?
*  That says how spooky the NFL's dominance is.
*  The crown jewel of TV football is SNF.
*  Last year, it registered a 12th consecutive season as Primetime's top-rated show, at least
*  according to NBC's interpretation of Nielsen metrics.
*  Its average viewership in 2022, 19.9 million, including the audience watching on streaming
*  services, bested the top scripted show, the Western drama Yellowstone, by more than 8
*  million.
*  That audience has impressive demographic breadth.
*  One-third is Black, Latino, or Asian.
*  Thirty-six percent are women.
*  At a time when cultural fragmentation and streaming are transforming the very idea of
*  TV, SNF is something like the last consensus choice, the proverbial hearth around which
*  the nation assembles each week.
*  At 7.10 p.m., the kickoff game went live.
*  There were performances of Lift Every Voice and Sing and the Star-Spangled Banner.
*  Fireworks exploded.
*  A B-2 bomber raced overhead.
*  In the booth, Toreko and Collinsworth set the scene, wondering aloud how the Chiefs
*  would fare without two of their stars, the tight end Travis Kelce out with a knee injury
*  and the defensive tackle Chris Jones, who was embroiled in a contract dispute.
*  Still, the Chiefs had Mahomes.
*  I think America is about to find out how good he really is, Collinsworth said.
*  In the A unit, Hyland and Esikoff had taken their places in front of that phalanx of screens.
*  Hyland turned to the assistant director Alex Habenstock.
*  Be great, Hobby.
*  He spoke into his headset mic.
*  Be great, Graphics.
*  The teams lined up for the kickoff.
*  Toreko, 56, is a suave and eloquent announcer who typically steers clear of clichés and
*  bombast, but the moment called for a touch of grandiloquence.
*  Deep in the distance, it's Las Vegas, he intoned, a reference to the site where Super Bowl
*  58 will take place in February.
*  The Chiefs place kicker Harrison Butker boomed the kick into the end zone.
*  In the control room, Esikoff drawled a request into his headset, looking for 16 White.
*  He wanted a shot of the Lions quarterback Jared Goff, who wears the number 16.
*  A moment later, America, or some not insignificant chunk of it, watched Goff jog onto the field
*  to take the season's first snap.
*  For two decades, we have talked about a new golden age of television, heaping acclaim
*  on prestige streaming and premium cable series.
*  But our praise songs to televisual art have largely ignored the most popular and the most
*  richly televisual TV of all.
*  Prestige dramas and comedies are, in essence, serialized movies.
*  But a football telecast belongs to a different category.
*  It is an extravagant exercise in visual storytelling.
*  An hours-long motion picture collage, assembled on the fly, pumped up with interstitial music,
*  graffitied with graphics, embellished with hokey human interest segments, and narrated
*  with varying degrees of wit and magniloquence by the featured soloists in the broadcast
*  booth.
*  As a technical feat, it's a mindblower.
*  A collective improvisation by a team of hundreds, pulled off with top craftsmanship under conditions
*  of extreme pressure.
*  Sunday Night Football is television's biggest show, but it might also be the best.
*  The flashiest, most exciting, most inventive, most artful use to which the medium has ever
*  been put.
*  On April 19th, four and a half months before the kickoff game, Rob Highland was in a conference
*  room in Stamford, Connecticut, where NBC Sports has been headquartered since 2013.
*  The 300,000-square-foot facility houses the studios and control rooms where the network
*  produces coverage of such properties as the Olympic Games.
*  But in Stamford, as in NBCUniversal's executive suites, there is an understanding that every
*  SNF occupies its own echelon.
*  It is the calling card show, says Mark Lazarus, the NBCUniversal Media Group chairman.
*  It's the cherry on top of the sundae of all the great content we have at Universal.
*  The exalted status of SNF was the subject, more or less, of the conference room gathering.
*  It was the production philosophy meeting, an overview that begins the run-up to the
*  season.
*  Highland and Essicoff were joined by 16 staff members, with nine others participating by
*  video.
*  Also present was a legend, Fred Godelli, who helmed SNF from its founding in 2006 through
*  the 2021 season and is regarded by many as TV's greatest football producer.
*  More recently, Godelli has led Thursday Night Football on Amazon Prime Video, which is produced
*  mainly by NBC staff, but he maintains an executive producer role at SNF.
*  The show is one of the only in all of television that still has the resources to allow you
*  to really think big, Highland told the group.
*  If you've got a great idea, you can actually do it on this show.
*  On a screen, a slideshow listed goals.
*  Continue to be the leader in storytelling, presentation, and innovation.
*  Make the viewer somewhere they have never been and could never go.
*  Identify a make you laugh, make you smile in each episode.
*  Over the next couple months, Highland said, we're going to deconstruct the show and think
*  about how we can do everything better.
*  Everything gets reevaluated every single off season.
*  Everything is not just a figure of speech.
*  SNF is defined by an attention to minutiae that extends from the metallic sheen on the
*  chyrons to the placement of cameras for capturing quarterback pressures by edge rushers.
*  If you work on this show, you have to be willing to nitpick, says Aaron Bollendorf, the show's
*  sideline producer.
*  No detail is too small.
*  In the meeting, Highland laid out a significant and subtle change to our presentation for
*  the coming year, a tweak to the onscreen placement of the play clock graphic.
*  It will now live right justified within the capsule of the score bar.
*  He discussed the importance of limiting the number of replays during red zone scoring
*  opportunities to not step on live action.
*  The third look at a fullback not catching a pass?
*  We don't need that.
*  He screened clips from the 2022 season talking through a muddled sequence in which SNF failed
*  to cut swiftly to footage of the Green Bay Packers coach Matt LaFleur calling a timeout,
*  and Toreko and Collinsworth were momentarily baffled by the play stoppage.
*  We need to answer the question for the viewer right away, Highland said.
*  We can't look for the answer, collectively, with 20 million people.
*  A production assistant, Samantha Segreto, praised a moment in the Chiefs-Jaguars divisional
*  game when a camera caught a telling view of Patrick Mahomes hobbling on a sprained ankle.
*  That's a good note, Highland said.
*  Much of the time the most effective storytelling is going to be simple.
*  A well-composed shot that includes an athlete's foot will tell a better story than some animated
*  graphic with laser beams coming off of it.
*  Highland is 48.
*  He is handsome in a vaguely mid-century way like Don Draper without the dark secrets.
*  He has tidy hair and a running backs build, though when he played football at Williams
*  College in Massachusetts, he was an offensive lineman.
*  In 1997, he got a job as a production assistant on NBC's NFL pregame show.
*  He joined SNF in its debut season as a replay director.
*  He held the job for just three years, but working with Gedelli was transformative.
*  I'd never been in a room where we did forensics on every element of the show, he says.
*  The idea was and still is, whether it's an average game or a great game, it has to look
*  and feel special.
*  Because it's a Sunday night football game.
*  That mystique once belonged to ABC's Monday Night Football, the primetime showcase that
*  started in 1970.
*  But by 2005, NFL executives had concluded that Sunday was a better spot for marquee
*  matchups.
*  NBC paid a reported $3.6 billion for a six-year contract.
*  In May 2006, Dick Ebersol, the NBC sports chairman, completed a raid on Monday Night
*  Football, hiring its producer and director, Gedelli and Esikoff, and its legendary broadcast
*  tandem.
*  Al Michaels, a virtuoso game caller with a wry, mon juste for every play and plot twist,
*  and John Madden, who revolutionized sports television by turning exegesis into entertainment,
*  illuminating football's complexities with folksy verbiage and a telestrator's pen that
*  he wielded like an action painter.
*  Ebersol showered Sunday Night Football with resources, telling Gedelli he need only worry
*  about producing a great program.
*  The result was bigger, brighter, and more sensational than any previous football telecast.
*  Each game was hyped like a mini-Super Bowl, with a glare and glare designed to jolt the
*  senses.
*  The production values embraced Disney-fied pump, computer animation, flashing lights,
*  power cords.
*  For years, the opening theme song of Monday Night Football was a version of Hank Williams
*  Jr.'s All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight, a choice that pitched a football
*  telecast as a night of white-male bonding and debauchery.
*  The Sunday Night Football anthem was sung first by Pink, then by Faith Hill, and for
*  the last 11 years by Carrie Underwood, artists with huge female fan bases.
*  SNF dragged the big game out of the man cave and into the living room.
*  It has proved a blockbuster.
*  It's an unnecessarily lavish show, but that's part of the charm, says Bill Simmons, the
*  sports pundit, podcaster, and founder of the website The Ringer.
*  Since day one, NBC has made it clear that money doesn't matter to them on Sunday nights.
*  Like at all.
*  An NBC Sports spokesperson declined to provide specifics, but the outlay is evidently enormous.
*  NBC now pays about $2 billion per year for broadcasting rights.
*  The SNF production costs are thought to be $40 million to $50 million annually.
*  Even huge ad revenues, $1.37 billion in 2021 to 2022, according to Standard Media Index,
*  would leave the endeavor hundreds of millions in the red.
*  Does the ad revenue cover our rights fee, Lazarus says?
*  No, but the value to our company, and affiliates and partners, is real.
*  That value, it seems fair to suggest, lies not just in the show's appeal to advertisers
*  and cable companies, but in NBC's old-fashioned pride in must-see TV, in airing the biggest
*  thing in primetime.
*  But SNF isn't just a testament to excess.
*  From the beginning, it has struck an improbable balance between carnival and seminar, seeking
*  new ways to make a Byzantine game more comprehensible.
*  Today that task falls chiefly to Collinsworth, the 64-year-old former Cincinnati Bengals
*  wide receiver who took over analyst duties in 2009.
*  Since then, he has solidified his place as football's most sagacious color commentator,
*  rendering judgments in a gravelly bass baritone that has inspired a cottage industry of impersonators.
*  Meme culture has seized on other ticks, like the Collinsworthism, now here's a guy.
*  But unlike the folkloric Madden or the hopped-up CBS analyst Tony Romo, who flaunts his smarts
*  by predicting plays before the ball is snapped, Collinsworth isn't first and foremost a personality.
*  He has the cool, questing demeanor of a detective, a guy, as Collinsworth himself might put it,
*  who regards football as a grand puzzle that rewards endless inquiry.
*  His investigations entail fieldwork.
*  Collinsworth flew into Kansas City on September 4th, three days before the kickoff game.
*  The following morning, he led an SNF delegation to the chief's practice facility, where they
*  held private interviews with Mahomes and others and spent 45 minutes watching the team run
*  through plays.
*  They also caught breaking news.
*  Collinsworth and Turrico were on the sideline chatting with the chief's general manager,
*  Brett Veach, when Travis Kelsey limped off with a bone bruise in his right knee.
*  The Kelsey injury was topic A the next day in a meeting room at a downtown Kansas City
*  hotel.
*  This was the coaches film meeting, where Collinsworth screens game tape and talks Xs and Os, and
*  producers formulate camera isolation and replay plans around the game he expects to see.
*  How might Detroit combat a chief's offense without Kelsey?
*  In 2022, the Lions played man-to-man pass coverage at the second highest rate in the
*  NFL, but Collinsworth explained that they had made a scheme change.
*  There would probably be more zone coverage, he speculated, or perhaps zone match.
*  As for Mahomes, since 2018 when he became the chief's starting quarterback, he had
*  played just one game without Kelsey.
*  Now the chiefs had two new offensive tackles and a shaggy receiving core with no clear
*  star.
*  Kelsey's ability to chip, get out on routes, it can't really be replaced.
*  So where is Patrick going with the ball?
*  Collinsworth's erudition is the fruit of obsessive film study and immersion in stats and data.
*  He is the majority owner of the sports analytics company PFF, but it also reflects a perspective
*  shift that is intuitive to football's wonks.
*  I never watch the ball, he says.
*  When he's in the broadcast booth, he will follow Toreco's call to learn where the ball
*  went, but his eyes are elsewhere.
*  He scans the pre-snap formations to make quick reads of the defensive coverage.
*  After the snap, he turns to the Skycam monitor, the view from behind the quarterback, to catch
*  the offensive lineman's first step, which tells him whether the play is a run or a pass.
*  If it's a run, he'll stick with Skycam.
*  If it's a pass, he may switch his attention to the defensive secondary to watch coverage
*  develop.
*  When the play is over, he says, I'm on the button to Rob, talking to Hyland in the truck
*  to suggest what replay the show should air.
*  Every play can take you in a different direction, Hyland says.
*  You can go to a replay to help support what your announcers are talking about.
*  You can show America a different angle on a play, or you can take America in a whole
*  new direction narratively.
*  You can go to a pre-produced element to showcase something interesting about a specific athlete
*  or coach.
*  You can go to a graphic to help support a storyline or to introduce a new storyline.
*  It's like John Madden used to say to me, a football broadcast is the greatest open book
*  test there is.
*  With nine minutes and 27 seconds to go in the first quarter of the kickoff game, the
*  Lions lined up for a punt at their own 17-yard line.
*  Brian Melillo, the audio engineer, was patrolling the sidelines to monitor communications, including
*  the critical link that lets NBC signal league officials when it wants to stop play to go
*  to commercial.
*  In the broadcast compound, the replay director, Charlie Vanacor, stood in the C unit truck,
*  facing what looked like a psychedelic video art installation.
*  Three giant panels, each holding more than two dozen small screens with feeds from live
*  cameras and replay sources.
*  In the A unit, Esikoff spoke into his headset, giving instructions to the operators of cameras
*  five and one about coverage of the punt.
*  Five, kicker, waist up.
*  One, returner, waist up.
*  Nearby, Alex Habenstock reminded Highland that Toreko should drop the name of a sponsor
*  during the rollout to the next commercial.
*  Going to break after the kick, YouTube mention.
*  But the commercial break would have to wait.
*  Dan Campbell, the Lions head coach, likes to run fake punts.
*  Over the past two seasons, Detroit successfully converted the trick play on six of seven attempts.
*  Now, just minutes into the new season, the Lions tried again.
*  The ball was snapped to the special teams captain, Jalen Reeves-Mabin, who barged through
*  a stack of chiefs to gain the first down.
*  On NBC's airwaves, Toreko let out a cry.
*  Dan Campbell, dice rolling from inside the 20 on drive two of the season.
*  Ten plays later, Jared Goff completed a nine yard touchdown pass to the receiver, Amon
*  Ra St. Brown.
*  In the truck, Highland spoke into his headset, asking Vanakkor and his team to feed him shots
*  of St. Brown.
*  As SNF bumped to commercial with slow motion images of the catch and the celebration, Toreko
*  said,
*  The fourth down pickup, a 91 yard drive.
*  They kept Patrick Mahomes off the field for eight minutes.
*  And the guy who makes the Lions offense go, Amon Ra St. Brown, first to the end zone this
*  year.
*  7-0 Detroit.
*  The delineation of duties in a sports broadcasting booth hews to a famous formula.
*  The play-by-play person handles what?
*  The color commentator's job is why?
*  Toreko is one of those eerily gifted announcers whose what?
*  Flows like water running over rocks in a riverbed.
*  His national TV career began in 1991 on ESPN's Sports Center.
*  He has broadcast countless events, from NHL games to the Olympics, as both a studio host
*  and a booth announcer.
*  He succeeded Al Michaels on Sunday Night Football in 2022.
*  And while some complain that today's SNF booth lacks the swagger of the old Michaels-Collinsworth
*  partnership, there's no gainsaying Toreko's mastery.
*  He sets a tone of relaxed omniscience.
*  The feeling that at every moment you're being told all you need to know in an optimally
*  elegant and succinct way.
*  He's a TV savant, Highland says.
*  When Toreko worked on Football Night in America, he was known to shadow Gaddely in the truck
*  during games.
*  He would sit in the tape room to watch the replay operation.
*  He would lurk in the graphics area.
*  There is no one I've ever worked with, Highland says, that comes close to his ability of the
*  mechanics of television.
*  Toreko's methodology is based on an ominous sounding acronym.
*  Die.
*  Document.
*  Inform.
*  And entertain.
*  He thrives especially in the informing department.
*  Each week he spends dozens of hours compiling his boards, notes about players, coaches,
*  ownership groups, hundreds of people who could become the story of the night, logged on a
*  Microsoft Surface that sits at his side in the booth.
*  I always start with the backup quarterback, he says.
*  As soon as the backup quarterback gets in the game, you can tell if somebody's prepared
*  for the broadcast or not.
*  Ideally, informing overlaps with documenting and entertaining in surprising and even poetic
*  ways.
*  As halftime approached in Kansas City with the score tied at 7-7, SNF returned from commercial
*  with an aerial shot of Arrowhead.
*  The stadium was in its 52nd season, Toreko said, and it shared its parking lot with Kauffman
*  Stadium, home of the Kansas City Royals.
*  As Mahomes barked signals, Toreko noted another baseball connection.
*  The quarterback, who is famous for throwing the football using arm angles like a shortstop,
*  was drafted by the Detroit Tigers before committing to football.
*  Two plays later, with 37 seconds remaining in the second quarter, Mahomes zipped a four-yard
*  pass to the tight end Blake Bell.
*  Sidearm sling for the touchdown, Toreko exclaimed.
*  Then he pulled out a final fact.
*  Like Mahomes, Bell was also drafted by the Detroit Tigers in 2010.
*  This was classic Toreko, a stream of improvised narration decorated with details from his
*  boards that unfurled like a scripted riff.
*  A touchdown drive with a baseball leitmotif.
*  This suavity is a solvent.
*  Highland calls Toreko the master of sanitation for his talent at cleaning up awkward on-air
*  moments.
*  He's also expert at knowing what not to say, a key skill he shares with most every NFL
*  announcer.
*  During the run of Sunday Night Football, a period that corresponds almost exactly to
*  the tenure of the NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, the league has achieved unprecedented popularity
*  while experiencing a breathtaking series of scandals.
*  It has been accused of racism and sexism, been scrutinized over the racial disparity
*  between its owners, executives and head coaches, and its majority black workforce of players,
*  been assailed for inadequate handling of off-field violence and abuse charges, and settled numerous
*  lawsuits including the Colin Kaepernick collusion grievance and a class action stemming from
*  the epidemic of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and other cognitive impairments among former
*  players.
*  These vexations hover over the weekly orgy of televised football, conspicuous in their
*  absence.
*  The NFL refers to TV networks as broadcast partners, a phrase that implies a certain
*  ideological lockstep.
*  That characterization doesn't sit well at SNF.
*  We're not a mouthpiece for the NFL, Highland says.
*  Toreko views the problem as one of context.
*  In general, he says, the body of a football game is a really poor place to have an intelligent
*  discussion of a significant issue.
*  A better venue, he suggests, is a pregame or postgame show, where the careful hashing
*  through of a domestic assault charge or a racial justice protest will not be interrupted
*  by a punt return.
*  But a skeptic might point out that those conversations rarely do take place on such shows, and while
*  the NFL and broadcasters often prefer to distinguish between on and off the field matters, the
*  reality is fuzzier.
*  Last season, when the Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin went into cardiac arrest after
*  making a hard tackle, the near-death experience caught ESPN's Monday Night Football flat-footed.
*  The moment called for a moral vocabulary, or at least for journalism's hard questions,
*  but the broadcast mustered mostly platitudes.
*  For viewers, part of the shock was the jarring tonal shift as the game was postponed and
*  then canceled, a disruption of televised football's usual brisk rhythms where the frequent carting
*  off of injured players is marked by perfunctory words of concern as play swiftly resumes.
*  In fact, TV football is not the politics-free zone imagined by the league and its broadcasters.
*  It is saturated by the NFL's own politics, which play down the consequences of football's
*  gladiatorial clashes while enshrining them as civic rights.
*  For decades, the league has wedded itself to patriotism that veers into jingoism, adopting
*  as its logo the martial symbol of a flag-decorated shield and embracing military fanfare that
*  broadcasters air as a matter of course.
*  Other strange scenes turn up on TV.
*  Viewers who tuned into the kickoff game were shown an Arrowhead Stadium ritual, the beating
*  of a ceremonial war drum accompanied by fans belting out the Chief's pseudo-Native American
*  war chant while performing the hand gesture known as the tomahawk chop, an inarguably
*  racist spectacle that the SNF team chose to treat as opening night pageantry.
*  Yet, who can doubt that, as Toreco and others suggest, viewers turn on the game to tune
*  out the world?
*  The pleasure we take in watching the NFL, like the multi-billion dollar revenues that
*  support it, rests on a collective decision to not think too hard about it all.
*  What's crazy to me is how foolproof football is, Bill Simmons says.
*  The sport can survive any scandal and basically anything unseemly.
*  He added, people forgive the league for literally anything.
*  Half-time at Arrowhead.
*  The score was 14-7, Chiefs.
*  In the broadcast compound, Esikoff emerged from the A-unit truck in search of his usual
*  mid-game sustenance, a peanut butter sandwich.
*  Esikoff is 66, tall and imposing, with a droll manner, full of wisecracks aimed at
*  colleagues and mordant jokes at the expense of his beloved New York Jets.
*  He is also, by nearly everyone's account, the auteur behind Sunday Night Football.
*  Esikoff's work has won 19 Emmy Awards and he has directed seven Super Bowl broadcasts,
*  including Super Bowl XLIX, the 2015 Patriots-Seahawks game that remains the most-watched program
*  in U.S. television history.
*  Highland compares the experience of doing a football broadcast with Esikoff to driving
*  a Ferrari.
*  Al Michaels has called him the Steven Spielberg of live television.
*  All sports are telegenic, but the marriage of football and TV was a true love match.
*  It's a story that stretches back to television's mid-century infancy, when the NFL occupied
*  a less lofty tier of the sporting pantheon and was quicker than, for instance, Major
*  League Baseball to embrace the new medium.
*  The experiment was aided by unlikely visionaries.
*  In 1965, the father-and-son team of Ed and Steve Sable, small-time filmmakers from New
*  partnered with the league to found NFL Films, an in-house movie studio.
*  Their films blend of orchestral swells, voice-of-god narration and stately cinematography, slow-motion
*  shots tracking spiraling passes, ghostly game footage from the frozen tundra of Green Bay's
*  Lambeau Field, cast the NFL in transcendent terms.
*  Crucially, the Sables aestheticized and ennobled football's violence with highlight montages,
*  moment of impact, that emphasized the brutal beauty of gang tackles and blindside hits,
*  depicting the player's ability to dispense and endure punishment as masculine virtue.
*  But the affinity between football and TV is not just about violence.
*  It is rooted in the sport's geometries and rhythms, in the rectangular gridiron playing
*  field, a clean green backdrop for football's maze of movement, and in the stop-start tempo
*  that makes room for the trimmings broadcasters favor.
*  There are other pauses built into the schedule.
*  The NFL operates on a scarcity principle.
*  This play just 17 times over an 18-week period, a stakes-raising regimen that makes every
*  game important.
*  The drama is heightened on Sunday nights when the field is washed in light and everything
*  – hash marks, helmets, coaches' headsets – takes on a cinematic gleam.
*  Viewed in high definition, the game is both intimate and enormous.
*  Players pick out beads of sweat and blades of grass, and they sweep up panoramic troop
*  movements and eruptions of athleticism.
*  At SNF, Esikoff is the person most attuned to the craft – the art – of televised
*  football.
*  As the halftime break wound down, he retook his position in the control room, facing that
*  big wall of screens.
*  One showed a live shot of fans in Detroit watching the game on a jumbotron at Ford Field.
*  Another held a shot from Stamford of Terry McCauley, a former NFL referee who serves
*  as the SNF Rules Analyst.
*  Two monitors, nicknamed Elvis and Costello, had been used in the first half for a segment
*  featuring the parents of the Lions defensive end Aidan Hutchinson, who agreed to wear mics
*  in the stands so NBC could air their reactions.
*  Esikoff was seated in front of the two largest screens – the program monitor, showing the
*  picture currently on air, and the preview monitor, the image queued to go live next.
*  He had a cup of coffee, and a flip card of team rosters was spread in front of him.
*  As Esikoff explains it, directing a football game is both diabolically complex and simple
*  in its essence.
*  You must have command of vast amounts of information and comfort with state-of-the-art machines.
*  You have to know where each camera is positioned and how to locate its feed amid the dizzying
*  grid of monitors.
*  Every week you have to commit to memory the names and uniform numbers of dozens of players.
*  You must be capable of conducting simultaneous conversations with the dozens of camera operators
*  hooked into your headset and with your colleagues in the truck, while listening closely to the
*  live audio going out on air.
*  And you need to do all this while calling out a virtually non-stop series of commands
*  to the technical director on your right.
*  Yet the heart of the gig is straightforward.
*  It's storytelling, Esikoff says.
*  My job is to make the audio and the video match as closely as I can.
*  He clings to pillars of classic narrative, cause and effect, triumph and defeat.
*  If the QB hits the receiver for 75 yards up the seam, it's probably because he had
*  plenty of time to throw.
*  So we're going to find a shot that shows you the pass protection.
*  You want to show both sides of an event.
*  I always say the hero on a play is no more important than the goat.
*  So right away I'll be in the ear of my cameraman.
*  56 blue is the goat.
*  A word I use a lot is bummage.
*  I want to see the bummage.
*  Because a lot of times the bummage is a more dramatic picture than the celebration.
*  The famous climax of the 2015 Super Bowl was a case in point.
*  Its startling twist ending brought a new main character surging into the spotlight, the
*  Patriots rookie cornerback Malcolm Butler, who intercepted the Seattle quarterback Russell
*  Wilson in the game's closing seconds, while offering scenes of ecstasy and a Boschian
*  panorama of bummage.
*  With a Super Bowl on the line, Esikoff says, the key figures are going to be isolated for
*  reaction shots.
*  Belichick, Pete Carroll, Brady on the bench, Richard Sherman.
*  Malcolm Butler probably wasn't ISO'd, but you'll get shots of him if the receiver is
*  ISO'd and you'll probably get other views on Skycam.
*  I know Pete Carroll and the coaches are going to be on cameras 5 and 11 or 21 and 25.
*  So it becomes just a matter of sequencing the shots.
*  You know, the coaches, the stars.
*  It's basic.
*  However diligently the creators of SNF plan, they have little idea what kind of show they
*  will be putting on.
*  For the Chiefs Lions game, there were nearly 50 pre-edited tape elements and more than
*  100 graphics, animations, photo bumps, and video.
*  But the vague hope was that most of this material would never make air.
*  We'll always have a million elements in place, Highland says.
*  The most important thing, I think, is having the discipline to know when it makes sense
*  to bring those things in and when to stay live in the moment.
*  Because sometimes all of a sudden, a football game is going to break out.
*  That's what happened at Arrowhead.
*  All night long, Esikoff had cameras returning to Kelsey, who was on the sidelines in street
*  clothes.
*  Collinsworth had been right.
*  Without their talismanic tight end, the Chiefs' offense was stymied.
*  Four minutes into the second half, Mahomes fizzed a pass to the wide receiver, Kadarius
*  Tony, who was on the sidelines in street clothes.
*  Mahomes fizzed a pass to the wide receiver, Kadarius Tony, who bobbled it into the grasp
*  of the Lions' rookie safety, Brian Branch.
*  Branch dashed 50 yards down the left sideline for a pick-six touchdown.
*  14-14.
*  The Chiefs added a field goal late in the third quarter and another early in the fourth
*  to reclaim the lead, 20-14.
*  Now the crowd was unleashing the notorious Arrowhead roar.
*  At the 12-minute and 11-second mark of the fourth quarter, the Lions' offense took over
*  at their own 25, calling two running plays that left them facing a key third down.
*  As the screen wiped to a shot of the teams facing off at the line of scrimmage, the game
*  clock on NBC's airwaves showed 10 minutes and 56 seconds left in the game.
*  But the play clock, that right, justified graphic that Highland spoke about months earlier
*  in Stamford, had turned red and ticked under five seconds.
*  Jared Goff was furiously clapping his hands, trying to get the ball snapped before the
*  clock expired.
*  The Arrowhead throng was doing its work.
*  Goff's signals were swallowed up by the din.
*  His teammates couldn't hear him.
*  The referees threw a delay-of-game flag.
*  It's going to only get louder, Torrico said.
*  As the referee John Hussey announced the penalty, Wendell Stevens, seated at his console,
*  adjusted the levels on the field mics, capturing the raucous, gnat sound.
*  Essicoff, meanwhile, made a series of cuts, showing, in rapid succession, Dan Campbell,
*  Goff, and the Chief's defensive coordinator, Steve Spagnolo, a nifty trip-tick, two parts
*  bummage, one part triumph.
*  But the sequence needed a final image.
*  Essicoff raised his voice and snapped into his headset.
*  Left five, both huddles, crowd behind, indicating that camera five, positioned slightly ahead
*  of the ball on a sideline cart, should pull back its focus to include the far-side crowd
*  in the framing of its two-huddle shot.
*  That image popped up on the preview monitor.
*  Essicoff issued directions.
*  Ready five, set five, and dissolve five.
*  And viewers at home watched the screen fade from the close-up of Spagnolo to a wide shot
*  capturing the teams breaking the huddle, the fans in the stands, and an LED scoreboard
*  wrapped around the stadium's lower bowl, flickering the phrase, Get Loud.
*  But the Lions weren't done.
*  They converted a third and twelve, and six plays later, the running back David Montgomery
*  rumbled into the end zone.
*  The extra point gave Detroit a 21 to 20 lead.
*  In the control room, Hyland stood to Essicoff's left.
*  Years ago, he had a water-skiing accident that required emergency hamstring surgery.
*  When he returned to work, it was too painful to sit.
*  Now, even after healing, he prefers to stand.
*  He gets a better view of the screens and finds it easier to concentrate through the marathon telecast.
*  During the commercial break, he spoke to Collinsworth on his headset.
*  Did the color man notice the block by the tight end Sam Laporta on the Lions' touchdown run?
*  Toreco got on the button to the truck.
*  Was there a live look that Drew caught of Mahomes?
*  It was really good, just like shaking his head, saying, Let's go.
*  I don't know if that's a good look on Supermo.
*  Hyland had a different idea.
*  I want to see Detroit.
*  He wanted a shot of Lions fans celebrating at Ford Field when they came back on air.
*  Together, he and Essicoff were engaged in a collaboration that invites superlatives and mixed metaphors.
*  When Dick Ebersol first saw Gedelli and Essicoff at work in a production truck, he said,
*  This is like watching the frickin' ballet.
*  Hyland and Essicoff choose football analogies.
*  They liken their roles to those of a coach who puts a game plan in place and a quarterback who executes it.
*  Other comparisons spring to mind.
*  Their ratatat back and forth, Hyland summoning replays for Collinsworth's telestrations,
*  comp tele and clear it, play it, Essicoff's near constant recitation of camera numbers and wipes and dissolves,
*  calls to mind a rapper's bars or an auctioneer's chant.
*  The effect is enhanced when you realize that this patter represents a gigantic game of telephone,
*  a conversation ricocheting between Hyland, Essicoff, and the more than 100 individuals who are in their ears at any time.
*  On the possession that followed the Lions' touchdown, the Chiefs stalled, punting with five minutes and seven seconds left.
*  They have a chance to take the game right now, Collinsworth said.
*  But it wasn't to be.
*  After one first down, the Lions came up short on their next three plays,
*  and Campbell rolled the dice again, trying a fourth down pass that was battered away at the line of scrimmage.
*  Torrico said,
*  The Lions hand the ball to the league MVP at the 45-yard line with two minutes and 29 seconds to go.
*  The Chiefs had a chance to steal a win, needing perhaps 20 yards to move into field goal range.
*  And then the drama turned to farce, as Mahomes' receivers let him down and penalties pushed the Chiefs backward.
*  A dropped pass, a completion nullified by a holding penalty, another pass, another drop, a near interception.
*  A fourth and 20 that became fourth and 25 when Jawan Taylor was flagged for a false start.
*  In the control room, the sequence rolled out in a blizzard of quick cuts, skycam close-ups, and split screens,
*  as Hyland and Essicoff blurted commands with rising urgency.
*  Gimme dejection on Mahomes.
*  Field to right tackle, 4K.
*  Five left, 11 right.
*  Preview effects.
*  Take effects.
*  For the professionals in the A unit, it was merely a heightened version of what they had been doing for hours.
*  To an untutored lurker, the whole thing seemed like a frickin' ballet or some less dainty choreography,
*  a headlong dance of astounding precision.
*  On fourth and 25, the Chiefs went for it again.
*  Mahomes took the snap, rolled left, and launched a throw that arced across the line to gain,
*  reaching the fingertips of the receiver Sky Moore, who couldn't clasp it.
*  Detroit was getting the ball back.
*  NBC went to commercial with its final act, a slow-motion montage of jubilant lions and doleful Chiefs.
*  Essicoff said, Good stuff, guys.
*  And for the first time since the half began, rose and stretched.
*  Just over two minutes later, Detroit converted a third and two for a first down.
*  Barring a catastrophic fumble, the Chiefs weren't getting the ball back.
*  On the air, Torrico said, The Detroit Lions are right there.
*  In the truck, Highland's pronouncement was less circumspect.
*  Game over, he said.
*  One measure of the success of Sunday Night Football is how Sunday Night Football-ish the competing broadcasts are looking.
*  If you tune into Monday Night Football or the big Sunday late afternoon games on CBS and Fox,
*  the rhythms and aesthetics of the broadcasts show a clear debt to SNF.
*  For the SNF team, Highland says, the challenge is to continue to distinguish our presentation from all others.
*  He and Gaddele had talked about this, he said later.
*  There's really not a lot that separates the A-level shows anymore.
*  Everyone is trying to do the exact same show.
*  Competitors are certainly throwing money at the problem.
*  In addition to the billions they pay the NFL for rights,
*  the networks in recent years have shelled out huge sums to re-sign top broadcast booth talent and lure glamorous new announcers.
*  In May 2022, Fox Sports announced that it had landed Tom Brady as the lead analyst for its NFL broadcasts
*  in a deal said to be the most lucrative in television sports history.
*  They reported $375 million for 10 years.
*  The broadcasters engaged in this arms race are arguably fighting the last war.
*  The generations that have come of age with social media may not attach the same mystique or FOMO to a live event unfolding in real time.
*  Why bother watching the whole game when you can catch quick-hitting highlights on an app?
*  A trend of disaggregation and downsizing can be seen across fan culture and sports media.
*  Fantasy football and prop betting view games through a splintered lens,
*  pricing individual stats and discreet in-game events over wins and losses.
*  There are alternative telecasts like ESPN's Manningcast, starring Peyton and Eli,
*  which refigures Monday Night Football as a chatty hang with the bros,
*  and the NFL Network's Red Zone, whose whip-around coverage offers viewers multiple games at once in split-screen formats.
*  The SNF model, airing one floodlit weekly game from opening kickoff to final whistle, is by definition, dowdy.
*  But for the time being, at least, it's huge.
*  NBC tallied an audience of 27.5 million watching the kickoff game across broadcast and streaming platforms.
*  It ranked as media's most-watched prime-time show since the last Super Bowl.
*  Three nights later, the whole operation had trucked to MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey,
*  for Cowboys Giants, the show's first Sunday broadcast of the year.
*  It was a washout, a 40-to-nothing Cowboys rout in the driving rain that found SNF filibustering its way through a dismal second half
*  with segments like a Melissa Stark report about the leg tattoo of the Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott.
*  Yet, according to NBC, the game still earned a viewership of 22 million.
*  Through the first 11 weeks of the 2023 season, SNF is averaging 21.4 million viewers, a 7% increase from last year,
*  and the show's best performance since 2015.
*  But it is not the way of Sunday Night Football to gloat.
*  Three days after Cowboys Giants, the production team was in Stamford, in the conference room again, doing a postmortem on its first two games.
*  That morning, Highland had sent an email to the staff that included his granular review of the kickoff game telecast.
*  He found many areas for improvement.
*  First four or five replays were a little late. Chris was waiting. Awkward silence.
*  Play action pass to Josh Reynolds. Should have froze VT99 when the LBs stepped up.
*  Did not replay Mahomes' scramble for first down before the end of the quarter. Pylon video needs to be addressed.
*  Rashi Rice reaction to commercial after the TD was not good. Black virtual line of scrimmage line for the Chiefs looked terrible.
*  Mike was close to getting clipped out of breaks.
*  I want to be a little bit tough and thorough this first week, Highland told the group in the conference room.
*  I just really want everyone to think about precision and execution. There is a lot we can and must do better.
*  I know America probably doesn't even notice this stuff. But we notice. Right?
*  Thank you for watching.
