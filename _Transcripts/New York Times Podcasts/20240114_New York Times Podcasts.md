# The Sunday Read: ‘How an Ordinary Football Game Turns Into the Most Spectacular Thing on TV’
**NewYorkTimesPodcasts:** [January 14, 2024](https://rr2---sn-ab5sznzz.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?expire=1710982886&ei=hjL7ZZ7zCsub_9EP05uWyAc&ip=128.59.179.6&id=o-AIJRgIgr3iL5xSRcR3dATpBRbtJDMgOtjbDsbeCwNZMd&itag=139&source=youtube&requiressl=yes&xpc=EgVo2aDSNQ%3D%3D&mh=4p&mm=31%2C26&mn=sn-ab5sznzz%2Csn-p5qs7nzr&ms=au%2Conr&mv=m&mvi=2&pl=16&initcwndbps=1707500&vprv=1&mime=audio%2Fmp4&gir=yes&clen=22122179&dur=3627.598&lmt=1705231655875504&mt=1710960809&fvip=5&keepalive=yes&beids=24350320&c=ANDROID_EMBEDDED_PLAYER&txp=6218224&sparams=expire%2Cei%2Cip%2Cid%2Citag%2Csource%2Crequiressl%2Cxpc%2Cvprv%2Cmime%2Cgir%2Cclen%2Cdur%2Clmt&sig=AJfQdSswRgIhAKf5uPgW7kc57lbWCBTn_M7uy8wGVhhfiRpZaHkg7UznAiEA6N1Fl8tmniDJS6ReuY1OWphZj-NrkYgHLYS8OeUsnic%3D&lsparams=mh%2Cmm%2Cmn%2Cms%2Cmv%2Cmvi%2Cpl%2Cinitcwndbps&lsig=ALClDIEwRQIhAM3vCCEuThEquHsCo0ZRtmR6SwXjelLLDRn7FsLZHZxTAiBljEMdaOtYXJft4Id-w2TbH6FEwW1xywq8YxWa_9V_FA%3D%3D)
*  I'm Jody Rosen and I'm a contributing writer for the New York Times magazine.
*  Every week tens of millions of people in the United States watch football, including me.
*  I watch football at home with my kid.
*  I watch it alone.
*  I watch it under the covers at night on my cell phone.
*  It's just an incredibly entertaining way to lose yourself for three hours.
*  And I've always been interested in the fact that football is so popular with such a broad
*  swath of Americans.
*  It's not just white guys and their man cave, but every kind of person on the demographic
*  spectrum.
*  But I was also interested in the artifice of televised football.
*  The idea that a TV broadcast isn't just an unmediated document of a game unfolding
*  in real time, but in many ways a crafted, televisual entertainment product.
*  In big picture terms, it means who wins and who loses, of course.
*  But it's also all the little details that make up that larger story.
*  It's the dramatic persona that coaches on either sideline, the owners of the teams who
*  are in the luxury suites, all the different star players.
*  Since I began to focus as a viewer on the technical aspects of the storytelling, I grew curious
*  about the vast labor force that's behind the spectacle of televised football.
*  So this week's Sunday read is my recent feature for the magazine about primetime television's
*  number one show for over a decade.
*  NBC's Sunday Night Football.
*  In 2022, 83 of the top 100 most watch television broadcasts of the year were NFL games.
*  And the most popular primetime show by far is Sunday Night Football.
*  To report this story, I sat in on off-season meetings with the makers of Sunday Night Football.
*  Their meticulous planners looking ahead to each individual game on their schedule and
*  plotting various storylines.
*  But the most exciting part of my reporting was when I attended the very first game of
*  the NFL season, spending time on the field in the broadcast booth and in the NBC Sports
*  production truck where the producers and directors actually pull off this vast symphonic
*  broadcast.
*  In front of us was a giant wall of 200 different video feeds that the producers and directors
*  were facing during the broadcast, making split second decisions about which images are
*  going to go up on air.
*  As the game is unfolding, they might be giving instructions to instant replay directors
*  or camera operators, speaking to the various statisticians and researchers, or crucially
*  communicating with the announcers in the booth.
*  The fact that they're able to assemble this collage of images in real time while simultaneously
*  conducting conversations with the cacophony of voices in their headsets, choreographing
*  a show that's seamless and exciting, it was kind of mind-blowing.
*  So here's my article.
*  Behind the scenes of the most spectacular show on TV, read by Robert Petkov.
*  Our audio producer is Jack Dessedora.
*  The original music for this episode was written and performed by Aaron Espizito.
*  Arrowhead Stadium, the home of the Kansas City Chiefs, the NFL's defending champions,
*  is a very loud place.
*  Players say that when the noise reaches top volume, they can feel vibrations in their
*  homes.
*  During a 2014 game, a sound meter captured a decibel reading equivalent to a jets taking
*  off, earning a Guinness World Record for loudest crowd roar at a sports stadium.
*  Chiefs fans know how to weaponize noise, quieting to a church like hush when the team's
*  great quarterback Patrick Mahomes calls signals, but then, when opponents have the ball, unleashing
*  a howl that can even drown out the sound of the play call crackling through the speaker
*  inside the rival quarterbacks helmet.
*  There are others whose work is complicated by the din.
*  Around 11 a.m. on Thursday, September 7th, Brian Milillo, an audio engineer for NBC Sports,
*  flagship NFL telecast Sunday Night Football, arrived at Arrowhead to prepare for that evening's
*  Chiefs Detroit Lions game.
*  It was a big occasion.
*  The annual season opener, the NFL kickoff game, traditionally hosted by the winner of
*  last season Super Bowl.
*  There would be speeches, fireworks, a military flyover, the unfurling of a championship banner.
*  A crowd of more than 73,000 was expected.
*  Arrowhead is a pretty rowdy setting, Milillo said.
*  It can present some problems.
*  Milillo was especially concerned about his crowd mics.
*  Three stereo microphones intended to catch the ambient ooze and ayes of fans mounted
*  a top 16-foot high painter's poles that he and a colleague had secured to the railing
*  separating the seats from the field.
*  These needed to be kept at a distance from exploding pyrotechnics and angled away from
*  the glare of the stadium's public address system.
*  A perhaps greater hazard was overzealous fans who were prone to shaking the poles or even
*  pulling them down.
*  You'll get people who've been tailgating for five hours.
*  Milillo said, I might have to bribe some people to stay off those poles.
*  Milillo and his microphones were part of a huge deployment of personnel and equipment descending
*  on Arrowhead that morning.
*  Broadcasting a football game on live television is one of the most complex technical and logistical
*  challenges in entertainment.
*  The task is magnified in the case of Sunday night football, which is known for sparing
*  no expense to deliver the most comprehensive coverage and the most arresting spectacles.
*  For the kickoff game, one of three 2023 regular season broadcasts by the SNF team that
*  do not take place on Sunday.
*  An NBC sports workforce of 200 traveled to Kansas City.
*  A convoy of ten trucks made the trip.
*  Four mobile production units and office truck, a generator in case power went down, a truck
*  for the football night in America pre-game show, and three haulers packed with sets, cranes
*  and dozens of cameras.
*  There were handheld cameras, cameras that sit atop mobile sideline carts, robotic cameras
*  that record beauty shots of the stadium exterior, ultra high resolution 4K cameras that
*  yield super slow motion replays.
*  Suspended from a web of fiber optic cables, more than 120 feet in the air, was Skycam, ready
*  to zip line over the field at up to 20 miles per hour.
*  Another camera would arrive later to provide a still loftier vantage point from a fixed
*  wing aircraft.
*  Then there were the microphones.
*  There were mics mounted on many of the cameras.
*  There were six parabolic mics, contraptions resembling satellite dishes that operators
*  strap on like sandwich boards and schlep around the sidelines to soak up sounds.
*  The NFL is particular about what audio can air, no conversations on the bench allowed,
*  but for each game, the league mics up several offensive linemen, allowing broadcasters
*  to catch the quarterback grunting his cadence and the crunch of pads colliding after the
*  snap.
*  The person responsible for the sonic personality of Sunday Night Football is Wendell Stevens,
*  the lead audio engineer.
*  That morning, Stevens was getting ready at his station, a 144 channel mixing console
*  in the show's main production truck.
*  What viewers might assume to be an unmediated flow of in-game audio is more like a live DJ
*  mix sculpted spontaneously by Stevens, who blends sounds from dozens of sources.
*  You don't want this constant roar and thunder, he said.
*  Football is a dynamic game in terms of sound.
*  He has other rules.
*  One is you mustn't miss the doink, the percussive thump when an errant kick strikes the goalposts,
*  which resonate like a giant tuning fork.
*  Stevens was in the chair for NBC's broadcast of the 2018 Bears Eagles Wildcard Playoff
*  game, which ended with a Bears field goal attempt that rebounded from a left upright to
*  the crossbar, an event that entered NFL lore as the double doink.
*  Stevens' core principle is that the voices of the play by play man, Mike Tureko, and
*  the analyst Chris Collinsworth must be boosted in the mix so they dominate even at moments
*  of peak sound and fury.
*  They are the stars of SNF, along with the sideline reporter Melissa Stark, who interviews players
*  and coaches and offers scuttlebutt during games.
*  But that on-air talent is supported by a vast unseen army in the packed broadcast booth
*  and the trucks, producers, directors, editors, graphics specialists, researchers, statisticians,
*  spotters, and others.
*  By the afternoon, nearly every member of that team had arrived at Arrowhead and was it
*  work in the TV compound just outside the stadium gates.
*  There, in the control room of the A-Unit truck, the coordinating producer Rob Highland and
*  the director Drew Esekoff stood facing a wall of LCD monitors showing nearly 200 video
*  feeds.
*  It was 3pm.
*  The production team had just finished the FACTS or Facilities check.
*  A lengthy run-through when game elements are rehearsed and technical effects, the
*  illustrator used to explicate instant replays, the video overlay demarcating the line to
*  gain, are tested.
*  Now it was time for a meeting with the camera crew.
*  Camera operators were given sheets containing headshots of coaching staffs, players' families,
*  anyone whose face they might be called upon to pick out on the sidelines or in the stands.
*  Isolation plans were distributed indicating which cameras would follow key players.
*  It's been 207 days since the Super Bowl.
*  Highland told the group, our country has been waiting for tonight.
*  So let's make sure we capture the scene.
*  Let's give America a reason to stick around throughout the night.
*  The word America is bandied freely at SNF as a synonym for the show's audience.
*  It's partly an expression of the nationalism and trenched in football culture, the flags
*  and flyovers and patriotic hullabaloo that surrounds the NFL.
*  But it is also a frank acknowledgement of the stature of televised football in American
*  life.
*  Football is, by far, the most popular thing on TV.
*  Last year, according to Nielsen, 83 of the 100 most viewed telecasts were NFL games,
*  including 19 of the top 20.
*  It's no exaggeration to say that television's continued existence as a purveyor of pre-scheduled
*  linear TV programming is predicated on football.
*  Year over year TV usage is crashing, says Anthony Croupe, a media reporter for the website
*  Sportico.
*  But the NFL is trending up.
*  To keep growing, to increase your ratings by 5 or 6% when viewership as a whole is down
*  10%.
*  It says how spooky the NFL's dominance is.
*  The crown jewel of TV football is SNF.
*  Last year, it registered a 12th consecutive season as prime times top rated show, at least
*  according to NBC's interpretation of Nielsen metrics.
*  Its average viewership in 2022, 19.9 million, including the audience watching on streaming
*  services, bested the top scripted show, the Western drama Yellowstone, by more than
*  8 million.
*  That audience has impressive demographic breadth.
*  One third is black, Latino or Asian.
*  36% are women.
*  At a time when cultural fragmentation and streaming are transforming the very idea of TV, SNF
*  is something like the last consensus choice, the proverbial hearth around which the
*  nation assembles each week.
*  At 7.10pm, the kickoff game went live.
*  There were performances of lift every voice and sing and the star-spangled banner.
*  Fireworks exploded.
*  A B2 bomber raced overhead.
*  In the booth, Toreco and Collinsworth set the scene, wondering aloud how the chiefs would
*  fare without two of their stars, the tight-end Travis Kelsey out with a knee injury and the
*  defensive tackle Chris Jones, who was embroiled in a contract dispute.
*  Still, the chiefs had my homes.
*  I think America is about to find out how good he really is, Collinsworth said.
*  In the A unit, Highland and Esekoff had taken their places in front of that fail-anks
*  of screens.
*  Highland turned to the assistant director Alex Hobbenstock.
*  Be great, hobby.
*  He spoke into his headset mic.
*  Be great graphics.
*  The teams lined up for the kickoff.
*  Toreco, 56, is a swav and eloquent announcer who typically steers clear of cliches and bombast,
*  but the moment called for a touch of grand eloquence.
*  Deep in the distance, it's Las Vegas, he intoned, a reference to the site where Super Bowl 58
*  will take place in February.
*  The chiefs place kicker, Harrison Butcher, boomed the kick into the end zone.
*  In the control room, Esekoff drooled a request into his headset, looking for 16 white.
*  He wanted a shot of the lion's quarterback, Jared Goff, who wears the number 16.
*  A moment later, America, or some not insignificant chunk of it, watched Goff jog onto the field
*  to take the season's first snap.
*  For two decades, we have talked about a new golden age of television, heaping a claim
*  on prestige, streaming, and premium cable series.
*  But our praise songs to television art have largely ignored the most popular and the
*  most richly television TV of all.
*  Prestige dramas and comedies are, in essence, serialized movies.
*  But a football telecast belongs to a different category.
*  It is an extravagant exercise in visual storytelling.
*  An hour's long motion picture collage, assembled on the fly, pumped up with interstitial music,
*  graffitied with graphics, embellished with hokey human interest segments, and narrated
*  with varying degrees of wit and magniliquence by the featured soloists in the broadcast
*  booth.
*  As a technical feat, it's a mind-blower.
*  A collective improvisation by a team of hundreds pulled off with top craftsmanship under conditions
*  of extreme pressure.
*  Sunday Night Football is television's biggest show, but it might also be the best.
*  The flashiest, most exciting, most inventive, most artful use to which the medium has
*  ever been put.
*  On April 19th, four and a half months before the kickoff game, Rob Highland was in a conference
*  room in Stanford, Connecticut, where NBC Sports has been headquartered since 2013.
*  The 300,000 square foot facility houses the studios and control rooms where the network
*  produces coverage of such properties as the Olympic Games.
*  But in Stanford, as in NBC Universal's executive suites, there is an understanding that SNF
*  occupies its own echelon.
*  It is the calling card show, says Mark Lazarus, the NBC Universal Media Group chairman.
*  It's the cherry on top of the Sunday of all the great content we have at Universal.
*  The exalted status of SNF was the subject, more or less, of the conference room gathering.
*  It was the production philosophy meeting, an overview that begins the run-up to the season.
*  Highland and Esekoff were joined by 16 staff members, with nine others participating
*  by video.
*  Also present was a legend, Fred Gidelli, who helmed SNF from its founding in 2006 through
*  the 2021 season and is regarded by many as TV's greatest football producer.
*  More recently, Gidelli has led Thursday night football on Amazon Prime Video, which is
*  produced mainly by NBC staff, but he maintains an executive producer role at SNF.
*  The show is one of the only and all of television that still has the resources to allow you to
*  really think big.
*  Highland told the group, if you've got a great idea, you can actually do it on this show.
*  On a screen, a slide show listed goals.
*  He told you to be the leader in storytelling, presentation and innovation.
*  Take the viewer somewhere they have never been and could never go.
*  Identify a make-you- laugh, make-you-smile in each episode.
*  Over the next couple months, Highland said, we're going to deconstruct the show and think
*  about how we can do everything better.
*  Everything gets re-evaluated every single off-season.
*  Everything is not just a figure of speech.
*  SNF is defined by an attention to minutiae that extends from the metallic sheen on the
*  chirons to the placement of cameras for capturing quarterback pressures by edge rushers.
*  If you work on this show, you have to be willing to nitpick, says Aaron Bollendorf, the
*  show's sideline producer.
*  No detail is too small.
*  In the meeting, Highland laid out a significant and subtle change to our presentation for the
*  coming year, a tweak to the on-screen placement of the play-clock graphic.
*  It will now live right justified within the capsule of the score bar.
*  He discussed the importance of limiting the number of replays during red zone scoring
*  opportunities to not step on live action.
*  The third look at a full-back not catching a pass, we don't need that.
*  The screened clips from the 2022 season, talking through a muddled sequence in which SNF
*  failed to cut swiftly to footage of the Green Bay Packers coach Matt LaFour calling a time
*  out, and Tareko and Collins' worth were momentarily baffled by the play-stoppage.
*  We need to answer the question for the viewer right away.
*  Highland said, we can't look for the answer collectively with 20 million people.
*  A production assistant, Samantha Segretto, praised a moment in the Chiefs Jaguar's
*  divisional round playoff game when a camera caught a telling view of Patrick Mahomes hobbling
*  on a sprained ankle.
*  That's a good note.
*  Highland said, much of the time the most effective storytelling is going to be simple.
*  A well-composed shot that includes an athlete's foot will tell a better story than some animated
*  graphic with laser beams coming off of it.
*  Highland is 48.
*  He is handsome in a vaguely mid-century way like Don Draper without the dark secrets.
*  He has tidy hair and a running-backs build, though when he played football at Williams College
*  in Massachusetts, he was an offensive lineman.
*  In 1997, he got a job as a production assistant on NBC's NFL pre-game show.
*  He joined SNF in its debut season as a replay director.
*  He held the job for just three years, but working with Gideli was transformative.
*  I'd never been in a room where we did forensics on every element of the show, he says.
*  The idea was and still is whether it's an average game or a great game it has to look
*  and feel special, because it's a Sunday Night Football game.
*  That mystique once belonged to ABC's Monday Night Football, the primetime showcase that
*  started in 1970.
*  But by 2005, NFL executives had concluded that Sunday was a better spot for marquee matchups.
*  NBC paid a reported $3.6 billion for a six-year contract.
*  In May 2006, Dick Ebersol, the NBC sports chairman, completed a raid on Monday Night Football,
*  hiring its producer and director, Gideli and Esekoff, and its legendary broadcast tandem.
*  Now Michaels, a virtuoso game caller with a rye, more juiced for every play and plot twist,
*  and John Madden, who revolutionized sports television by turning exegesis into entertainment,
*  illuminating football's complexities with folksy verbiage and a illustrator's pen that
*  he wielded like an action painter.
*  Ebersol showered Sunday Night Football with resources, telling Gideli he need only worry
*  about producing a great program.
*  The result was bigger, brighter, and more sensational than any previous football telecast.
*  Each game was hyped like a mini-superbowl with a glare and glare designed to jolt the senses.
*  The production values embraced disnified pump, computer animation, flashing lights, power
*  cords.
*  For years, the opening theme song of Monday Night Football was a version of Hank Williams
*  Jr.'s All My Routy Friends are coming over tonight, a choice that pitched a football telecast
*  as a night of white male bonding and debauchery.
*  The Sunday Night Football Anthem was sung first by Pink, then by Faith Hill, and for the
*  last 11 years by Carrie Underwood, artists with huge female fan bases.
*  SNF dragged the big game out of the man cave and into the living room.
*  It has proved a blockbuster.
*  It's an unnecessarily lavish show, but that's part of the charm, says Bill Simmons, the sports
*  pundit, podcaster, and founder of the website The Ringer.
*  Since day one, NBC has made it clear that money doesn't matter to them on Sunday nights.
*  Like at all.
*  An NBC sports spokesperson declined to provide specifics, but the outlay is evidently
*  enormous.
*  NBC now pays about $2 billion per year for broadcasting rights.
*  The SNF production costs are thought to be $40 million to $50 million annually.
*  Even huge ad revenues, $1.37 billion in 2021 to 2022, according to Standard Media Index,
*  would leave the endeavor hundreds of millions in the red.
*  Does the ad revenue cover our rights fee?
*  Lazarus says, no, but the value to our company and affiliates and partners is real.
*  That value, it seems fair to suggest, lies not just in the show's appeal to advertisers
*  and cable companies, but in NBC's old-fashioned pride in must-see TV, in airing the biggest
*  thing in prime time.
*  But SNF isn't just a testament to excess.
*  From the beginning, it has struck an improbable balance between Carnival and Seminar, seeking
*  new ways to make a Byzantine game more comprehensible.
*  Today that task falls chiefly to Collinsworth, the 64-year-old former Cincinnati Bengals
*  wide receiver who took over analyst duties in 2009.
*  Since then, he has solidified his place as football's most segacious color commentator,
*  rendering judgments in a gravely-based baritone that has inspired a cottage industry of impersonators.
*  Meme culture has seized on other ticks, like the Collinsworthism, now here's a guy.
*  But unlike the folkloric Madden or the hopped up CBS analyst Tony Romo, who flaunts his
*  smarts by predicting plays before the ball is snapped, Collinsworth isn't first and
*  foremost a personality.
*  He has the cool, questing demeanor of a detective, a guy as Collinsworth himself might put it,
*  who regards football as a grand puzzle that rewards endless inquiry.
*  His investigations entail fieldwork.
*  Collinsworth flew into Kansas City on September 4, three days before the kickoff game.
*  The following morning, he led an SNF delegation to the chief's practice facility where they
*  held private interviews with my homes and others and spent 45 minutes watching the team run
*  through plays.
*  They also caught breaking news.
*  Collinsworth and Tureko were on the sideline chatting with the chief's general manager,
*  Brett Veach, when Travis Kelsey limped off with a bone bruise in his right knee.
*  The Kelsey injury was topic A the next day in a meeting room at a downtown Kansas City
*  hotel.
*  This was the coaches film meeting where Collinsworth screens game tape and talks exes and oes and
*  producers formulate camera isolation and replay plans around the game he expects to see.
*  How might Detroit combat a chief's offense without Kelsey?
*  In 2022, the Lions played man-to-man pass coverage at the second highest rate in the NFL,
*  but Collinsworth explained that they had made a scheme change.
*  There would probably be more zone coverage he speculated or perhaps zone match.
*  As for my homes, since 2018, when he became the chief's starting quarterback, he had played
*  just one game without Kelsey.
*  Now the chief's had two new offensive tackles and a shaggy receiving core with no clear
*  star.
*  Kelsey's ability to chip get out on routes, it can't really be replaced.
*  So where is Patrick going with the ball?
*  Collinsworth's air edition is the fruit of obsessive film study and immersion in stats
*  and data.
*  He is the majority owner of the sports analytics company PFF, but it also reflects
*  a perspective shift that is intuitive to football's wanks.
*  I never watch the ball, he says.
*  When he's in the broadcast booth, he will follow Toreco's call to learn where the ball
*  went, but his eyes are elsewhere.
*  He scans the pre-snap formations to make quick reads of the defensive coverage.
*  After the snap, he turns to the Skycam monitor, the view from behind the quarterback, to
*  catch the offensive lineman's first step, which tells him whether the play is a run or
*  a pass.
*  If it's a run, he'll stick with Skycam.
*  If it's a pass, he may switch his attention to the defensive secondary to watch coverage
*  develop.
*  When the play is over, he says, I'm on the button to rob, talking to Highland in the truck
*  to suggest what replay the show should air.
*  Every play can take you in a different direction.
*  Highland says, you can go to a replay to help support what your announcers are talking
*  about.
*  You can show America a different angle on a play, or you can take America in a whole new
*  direction narratively.
*  You can go to a pre-produced element to showcase something interesting about a specific
*  athlete or coach.
*  You can go to a graphic to help support a storyline or to introduce a new storyline.
*  It's like John Madden used to say to me, a football broadcast is the greatest open book
*  test there is.
*  With nine minutes and 27 seconds to go in the first quarter of the kickoff game, the
*  Lions lined up for a punt at their own 17-yard line.
*  Brian Milillo, the audio engineer, was patrolling the sidelines to monitor communications, including
*  the critical link that lets NBC signal league officials when it wants to stop play to go
*  to commercial.
*  In the broadcast compound, the replay director Charlie Vanacore stood in the C unit truck,
*  facing what looked like a psychedelic video art installation.
*  Three giant panels each holding more than two dozen small screens with feeds from live
*  cameras and replay sources.
*  In the A unit, Esacoff spoke into his headset, giving instructions to the operators of
*  cameras five and one about coverage of the punt.
*  Five, kicker, waste up.
*  One, returner, waste up.
*  Nearby, Alex Hobbenstock reminded Highland that Tureko should drop the name of a sponsor
*  during the rollout to the next commercial.
*  Going to break after the kick, YouTube mentioned.
*  But the commercial break would have to wait.
*  Dan Campbell, the Lions head coach, likes to run fake puns.
*  Over the past two seasons, Detroit successfully converted the trick play on six of seven attempts.
*  Now, just minutes into the new season, the Lions tried again.
*  The ball was snapped to the special teams captain, Jalen Reeves Maibin, who barged through
*  a stack of chiefs to gain the first down.
*  On NBC's airwaves, Tureko let out a cry.
*  Dan Campbell diced Roland from inside the 20 on drive two of the season.
*  Ten plays later, Jared Goff completed a nine yard touchdown pass to the receiver, Amman
*  Ross St. Brown.
*  In the truck, Highland spoke into his headset, asking Vanacore and his team to feed him shots
*  of St. Brown.
*  As SNF bumped to commercial with slow motion images of the catch and the celebration, Tureko
*  said, the fourth down pickup, a 91 yard drive.
*  They kept Patrick Mahomes off the field for eight minutes.
*  And the guy who makes the Lions offense go, Amman Ross St. Brown, first to the end zone this
*  year.
*  And nothing destroyed.
*  The delineation of duties in a sports broadcasting booth hues to a famous formula.
*  The play by playperson handles what?
*  The color commentator's job is why?
*  Tureko is one of those eerily gifted announcers whose what flows like water running over rocks
*  in a riverbed.
*  His national TV career began in 1991 on ESPN's sports center.
*  He has broadcast countless events from NHL games to the Olympics as both a studio host
*  and a booth announcer.
*  He succeeded Al Michaels on Sunday night football in 2022.
*  And while some complain that today's SNF booth lacks the swagger of the old Michaels
*  Collins' worth partnership, there's no gains saying Tureko's mastery.
*  He sets a tone of relaxed omniscience.
*  And feeling that at every moment you're being told all you need to know in an optimally
*  elegant and succinct way.
*  He's a TV savant, Highland says.
*  When Tureko worked on football night in America, he was known to Shadow Gidelli in the truck
*  during games.
*  He would sit in the tape room to watch the replay operation.
*  He would lurk in the graphics area.
*  There is no one I've ever worked with, Highland says, that comes close to his ability of
*  the mechanics of television.
*  Tureko's methodology is based on an ominous sounding acronym.
*  DIE.
*  Document.
*  Inform.
*  And entertain.
*  He thrives, especially in the informing department.
*  Each week he spends dozens of hours compiling his boards.
*  Notes about players, coaches, ownership groups, hundreds of people who could become the
*  story of the night, logged on a Microsoft surface that sits at his side in the booth.
*  I always start with the backup quarterback, he says.
*  As soon as the backup quarterback gets in the game, you can tell if somebody's prepared
*  for the broadcast or not.
*  Ideally, informing overlaps with documenting and entertaining in surprising and even poetic
*  ways.
*  As half time approached in Kansas City with the score tied at 7-7, SNF returned from
*  commercial with an aerial shot of arrowhead.
*  The stadium was in its 52nd season, Tureko said, and it shared its parking lot with
*  Kaufman Stadium, home of the Kansas City Royals.
*  As Mahomes barked signals, Tureko noted another baseball connection.
*  The quarterback who is famous for throwing the football using arm angles like a shortstop
*  was drafted by the Detroit Tigers before committing to football.
*  Two plays later, with 37 seconds remaining in the second quarter, Mahomes zipped a four-yard
*  pass to the tight end Blake Bell.
*  Sidearm slaying for the touchdown, Tureko exclaimed.
*  Then he pulled out a final fact.
*  Like Mahomes, Bell was also drafted by the Detroit Tigers in 2010.
*  This was classic Tureko, a stream of improvised narration decorated with details from his
*  boards that unfurled like a scripted riff.
*  A touchdown drive with a baseball light motif.
*  This swaviti is a solvent.
*  Highland calls Tureko the master of sanitation for his talent at cleaning up awkward on-air
*  moments.
*  He's also expert at knowing what not to say, a key skill he shares with most every NFL
*  announcer.
*  During the run of Sunday Night Football, a period that corresponds almost exactly to the
*  tenure of the NFL Commissioner Roger Gadell, the league has achieved unprecedented popularity
*  while experiencing a breathtaking series of scandals.
*  It has been accused of racism and sexism, been scrutinized over the racial disparity between
*  its owners, executives, and head coaches and its majority black workforce of players.
*  Been assailed for inadequate handling of off-field violence and abuse charges.
*  And settled numerous lawsuits, including the Colin Kaepernick, Collusion Grievance,
*  and a class action stemming from the epidemic of chronic traumatic and cephalopathy and other
*  cognitive impairments among former players.
*  These vexations hover over the weekly orgy of televised football, conspicuous in their
*  absence.
*  The NFL refers to TV networks as broadcast partners, a phrase that implies a certain ideological
*  lockstep.
*  That characterization doesn't sit well at SNF.
*  We're not a mouthpiece for the NFL, Highland says.
*  Tureko views the problem as one of context.
*  In general, he says, the body of a football game is a really poor place to have an intelligent
*  discussion of a significant issue.
*  A better venue, he suggests, is a pre-game or post-game show, where the careful hashing
*  through of a domestic assault charge or a racial justice protest will not be interrupted
*  by a punt return.
*  But a skeptic might point out that those conversations rarely do take place on such shows, and while
*  the NFL and broadcasters often prefer to distinguish between on and off the field matters,
*  the reality is buzzier.
*  Last season, when the Buffalo Bill's safety, Demar Hamlin went into cardiac arrest after
*  making a hard tackle, the near-death experience caught ESPN's Monday Night Football flatfooted.
*  The moment called for a moral vocabulary, or at least for journalism's hard questions,
*  but the broadcast mustered mostly platitudes.
*  For viewers, part of the shock was the jarring tonal shift as the game was postponed and then
*  canceled.
*  A disruption of televised football's usual brisk rhythms, where the frequent carting
*  off of injured players is marked by perfunctory words of concern as play swiftly resumes.
*  In fact, TV football is not the politics-free zone imagined by the league and its broadcasters.
*  It is saturated by the NFL's own politics, which play down the consequences of football's
*  gladiatorial clashes while enshrining them as civic rights.
*  For decades, the league has wedded itself to patriotism that veers into jingoism, adopting
*  as its logo, the martial symbol of a flag-decorated shield, and embracing military fanfare that
*  broadcasters air as a matter of course.
*  Other strange scenes turn up on TV?
*  Viewers who tuned into the kickoff game were shown an arrowhead stadium ritual, the beating
*  of a ceremonial war drum accompanied by fans belting out the chiefs pseudo-native-american
*  war chant while performing the hand gesture known as the Tomahawk Chop, an inarguably racist
*  spectacle that the SNF team chose to treat as opening night pageantry.
*  Yet, who can doubt that as Tureko and others suggest viewers turn on the game to tune out
*  the world?
*  The pleasure we take in watching the NFL, like the multi-billion dollar revenues that
*  support it rests on a collective decision to not think too hard about it all.
*  Football's cruelties and inequities, the toll it exacts on bodies and minds, that stuff
*  is easy enough to ignore when a thrilling show is on the flat screen.
*  What's crazy to me is how foolproof football is, Bill Simmons says, the sport can survive
*  any scandal and basically anything unseemly.
*  He added, people forgive the league for literally anything.
*  Half-time at Arrowhead.
*  The score was 14-7 Chiefs.
*  In the broadcast compound, Esacoffi merged from the A-Unit truck in search of his usual
*  mid-game sustenance, a peanut butter sandwich.
*  Esacoffi's 66 tall and imposing, with a drool manner full of wise cracks aimed at colleagues
*  and mordant jokes at the expense of his beloved New York Jets.
*  He is also, by nearly everyone's account, the tour behind Sunday Night Football.
*  Esacoff's work has won 19 Emmy Awards and he has directed seven Super Bowl broadcasts,
*  including Super Bowl 49, the 2015 Patriots Seahawks game that remains the most watched
*  program in U.S. television history.
*  Highland compares the experience of doing a football broadcast with Esacoffi to driving
*  a Ferrari.
*  Al Michaels has called him the Steven Spielberg of live television.
*  All sports are telegenic, but the marriage of football and TV was a true love match.
*  It's a story that stretches back to television's mid-century infancy when the NFL occupied
*  a less lofty tier of the sporting pantheon and was quicker than, for instance, major league
*  baseball to embrace the new medium.
*  The experiment was aided by unlikely visionaries.
*  In 1965, the father and son team of Ed and Steve Sable, small-time filmmakers from New
*  Jersey, partnered with the league to found NFL films and in-house movie studio.
*  Their films blend of orchestral swells, voice of god narration and stately cinematography,
*  slow-motion shots tracking spiraling passes, ghostly game footage from the frozen tundra
*  of Green Bay's Lambo field cast the NFL in transcendent terms.
*  Crucially, the Sable's aestheticized and enabled football's violence, with highlight
*  montages, moment of impact, that emphasized the brutal beauty of gang tackles and blind
*  side hits, depicting the player's ability to dispense and endure punishment as masculine
*  virtue.
*  But the affinity between football and TV is not just about violence.
*  It is rooted in the sports, geometries, and rhythms.
*  In the rectangular gridiron playing field, a clean green backdrop for football's maze
*  of movement, and in the stop start tempo that makes room for the Trimmings broadcasters
*  favorite.
*  There are other pauses built into the schedule.
*  The NFL operates on a scarcity principle.
*  Teams play just 17 times over an 18-week period, a stakes-raising regimen that makes
*  every game important.
*  The drama is heightened on Sunday nights when the field is washed in light and everything,
*  hash marks, helmets, coaches' headsets, takes on a cinematic gleam.
*  Dewed in high definition, the game is both intimate and enormous.
*  Cameras pick out beads of sweat and blades of grass, and they sweep up panoramic troop movements
*  and eruptions of athleticism.
*  At SNF, Esekoff is the person most attuned to the craft, the art of televised football.
*  As the halftime break wound down, he re-took his position in the control room, facing that
*  big wall of screens.
*  One showed a live shot of fans in Detroit watching the game on a jumbo-tron at Ford Field.
*  Another held a shot from Stanford of Terry McCauley, a former NFL referee who serves as
*  the SNF rules analyst.
*  Two monitors, nicknamed Elvis and Costello, had been used in the first half for a segment
*  featuring the parents of the lion's defensive end Aiden Hutchinson, who agreed to wear
*  mics in the stands so NBC could air their reactions.
*  Esekoff was seated in front of the two largest screens, the program monitor showing the picture
*  currently on air and the preview monitor, the image queued to go live next.
*  He had a cup of coffee and a flip card of team rosters was spread in front of him.
*  As Esekoff explains it, directing a football game is both diabolically complex and simple
*  in its essence.
*  You must have command a vast amounts of information and comfort with state-of-the-art machines.
*  You have to know where each camera is positioned and how to locate its feed amid the dizzying
*  grid of monitors.
*  Every week you have to commit to memory the names and uniform numbers of dozens of players.
*  You must be capable of conducting simultaneous conversations with the dozens of camera
*  operators hooked into your headset and with your colleagues in the truck while listening
*  closely to the live audio going out on air.
*  And you need to do all this while calling out a virtually non-stop series of commands
*  to the technical director on your right.
*  At the heart of the gig is straightforward.
*  Its storytelling, Esekoff says, My job is to make the audio and the video match as closely
*  as I can.
*  He clings to pillars of classic narrative, cause and effect, triumph and defeat.
*  If the QB hits the receiver for 75 yards up the seam, it's probably because he had plenty
*  of time to throw.
*  So we're going to find a shot that shows you the past protection.
*  You want to show both sides of an event.
*  I always say the hero on a play is no more important than the goat.
*  So right away I'll be in the ear of my cameraman.
*  56 blue is the goat.
*  A word I use a lot is bummage.
*  I want to see the bummage because a lot of times the bummage is a more dramatic picture
*  than the celebration.
*  The famous climax of the 2015 Super Bowl was a case in point.
*  This startling twist ending brought a new main character surging into the spotlight.
*  The Patriots rookie cornerback Malcolm Butler who intercepted the Seattle quarterback
*  Russell Wilson in the games closing seconds while offering scenes of ecstasy and a bushy
*  and panorama of bummage.
*  With a Super Bowl on the line, Esekoff says the key figures are going to be isolated
*  for reaction shots.
*  Bellachick Pete Carroll Brady on the bench Richard Sherman.
*  Malcolm Butler probably wasn't ISO'd but you'll get shots of him if the receiver is
*  ISO'd and you'll probably get other views on Skycam.
*  I know Pete Carroll and the coaches are going to be on cameras 5 and 11 or 21 and 25.
*  I know Pete Carroll and the coaches are going to be on camera 5 and 11 or 21 and 25.
*  So it becomes just a matter of sequencing the shots.
*  You know, the coaches, the stars.
*  It's basic.
*  However diligently the creators of SNF plan, they have little idea what kind of show they
*  will be putting on.
*  For the Chiefs Lions game, there were nearly 50 pre-edited tape elements and more than
*  100 graphics, animations, photo bumps, stats, storytels, ready to go.
*  But the vague hope was that most of this material would never make air.
*  We'll always have a million elements in place, Highland says.
*  The most important thing I think is having the discipline to know when it makes sense
*  to bring those things in and when to stay live in the moment.
*  Because sometimes all of a sudden, a football game's going to break out.
*  That's what happened at Arrowhead.
*  All night long, Essekoff had cameras returning to Kelsey who was on the sidelines in street
*  clothes.
*  Collins' worth had been right.
*  Without their talismanic tight end, the Chiefs offense was stymied.
*  Four minutes into the second half, Mahomes fizzed a pass to the wide receiver Coderius
*  Tony who bobbled it into the grasp of the lion's rookie safety, Brian Branch.
*  Branch dashed 50 yards down the left sideline for a pick-six touchdown.
*  14-14.
*  The Chiefs added a field goal late in the third quarter and another early in the fourth
*  to reclaim the lead, 2014.
*  Now the crowd was unleashing the notorious Arrowhead roar.
*  At the 12-minute and 11-second mark of the fourth quarter, the Lions' offense took over
*  at their own 25, calling two running plays that left them facing a key third down.
*  As the screen wiped to a shot of the teams facing off at the line of scrimmage, the game
*  clock on NBC's Airwaves showed 10 minutes and 56 seconds left in the game.
*  But the play clock, that right justified graphic that Highland spoke about months earlier
*  in Stanford, had turned red and ticked under five seconds.
*  Jared Goff was furiously clapping his hands, trying to get the ball snapped before the clock
*  expired.
*  The Arrowhead throng was doing its work.
*  Goff's signals were swallowed up by the din.
*  His teammates couldn't hear him.
*  The referees threw a delay of game flag.
*  It's going to only get louder, Toreco said.
*  As the referee John Hussey announced the penalty, Wendell Stevens, seated at his console,
*  busted the levels on the field mics capturing the raucous, nat sound.
*  Asakov, meanwhile, made a series of cuts showing in rapid succession, Dan Campbell, Goff,
*  and the Chief's defensive coordinator Steve Spegnolo, a nifty trip-tick, two parts
*  bummage, one part triumph.
*  But the sequence needed a final image.
*  Asakov raised his voice and snapped into his headset.
*  At five, both huddles, crowd behind, indicating that camera five positioned slightly ahead of
*  the ball on a sideline cart, should pull back its focus to include the far side crowd in
*  the framing of its two-huddle shot.
*  That image popped up on the preview monitor.
*  Asakov issued directions.
*  Ready five, set five, and dissolve five.
*  And viewers at home watched the screen fade from the close-up of Spegnolo to a wide shot
*  capturing the teams breaking the huddle, the fans in the stands, and an LED scoreboard
*  wrapped around the stadium's lower bowl flickering the phrase, Get Loud.
*  But the lions weren't done.
*  They converted a third and twelve, and six plays later the running back David Montgomery
*  rumbled into the end zone.
*  The extra point gave Detroit a twenty-one to twenty lead.
*  In the control room, Highland stood to Asakov's left.
*  Years ago, he had a water-skiing accident that required emergency hamstring surgery.
*  When he returned to work, it was too painful to sit.
*  Now, even after healing, he prefers to stand.
*  He gets a better view of the screens and finds it easier to concentrate through the marathon
*  telecast.
*  In the commercial break, he spoke to Collins' worth on his headset.
*  Did the color man notice the block by the tight-end Sam LaPorta on the lion's touchdown
*  run?
*  Tareko got on the button to the truck.
*  Was there a live look that drew caught of my homes?
*  It was really good, just like shaking his head, saying, Let's Go.
*  I don't know if that's a good look on Supermo.
*  Highland had a different idea.
*  I want to see Detroit.
*  He wanted a shot of lions fans celebrating it forward field when they came back on air.
*  Together, he and Asakov were engaged in a collaboration that invites superlatives and mixed
*  metaphors.
*  When Dick Ebersol first saw Gidelli and Asakov at work in a production truck, he said,
*  This is like watching the Frickin Ballet.
*  Highland and Asakov choose football analogies.
*  They liken their roles to those of a coach who puts a game plan in place and a quarterback
*  who executes it.
*  Other comparisons spring to mind.
*  Their Ratatat back and forth, Highland summoning replays for Collins' worths, illustrations,
*  Comp-Telly, and Clear It, Play It, Asakov's near constant recitation of camera numbers and
*  wipes and dissolves, calls to mind a rapper's bars or an auctioneer's chant.
*  The effect is enhanced when you realize that this pattern represents a gigantic game of
*  telephone, a conversation ricocheting between Highland, Asakov, and the more than 100 individuals
*  who are in their ears at any time.
*  On the possession that followed the lion's touchdown, the chiefs stalled, punting with
*  five minutes and seven seconds left.
*  They have a chance to take the game right now, Collins' worth said, but it wasn't to
*  be.
*  After one first down, the lions came up short on their next three plays and Campbell rolled
*  the dice again, trying a fourth down pass that was battered away at the line of scrimmage.
*  To Rico said, the lions hand the ball to the league MVP at the 45 yard line with two minutes
*  and 29 seconds to go.
*  The chiefs had a chance to steal a win, needing perhaps 20 yards to move into field goal
*  range.
*  And then the drama turned to farce, as Mahomes' receivers let him down and penalties pushed
*  the chiefs backward.
*  A dropped pass, a completion nullified by a holding penalty, another pass, another drop,
*  a near interception.
*  A fourth and 20 that became fourth and 25 when Jawan Taylor was flagged for a false start.
*  In the control room, the sequence rolled out in a blizzard of quick cuts, skycam close-ups
*  and split screens, as Highland and Esacoff blurted commands with rising urgency.
*  Gimme dejection on Mahomes.
*  Field to right tackle, 4K, 5 left, 11 right, preview effects, take effects.
*  For the professionals in the A unit, it was merely a heightened version of what they had
*  been doing for hours.
*  To an untutored lurker, the whole thing seemed like a fricking ballet, or some less dainty
*  choreography, a headlong dance of astounding precision.
*  On fourth and 25, the chiefs went for it again.
*  Mahomes took the snap, rolled left and launched a throw that arced across the line to gain,
*  reaching the fingertips of the receiver Skymore who couldn't clasp it.
*  Detroit was getting the ball back.
*  NBC went to commercial with its final act, a slow-motion montage of jubilant lions
*  and doleful chiefs.
*  Esacoff said, good stuff, guys, and for the first time since the half began, rows and stretched.
*  Just over two minutes later, Detroit converted a third and two for a first down.
*  Barring a catastrophic fumble, the chiefs weren't getting the ball back.
*  On the air, Toreco said, the Detroit lions are right there.
*  In the truck, Highlands' pronouncement was less circumspect.
*  Game over, he said.
*  One measure of the success of Sunday Night Football is how Sunday Night Football-ish
*  the competing broadcasts are looking.
*  If you tune into Monday Night Football or the big Sunday late afternoon games on CBS
*  and Fox, the rhythms and aesthetics of the broadcasts show a clear debt to SNF.
*  For the SNF team, Highland says, the challenge is to continue to distinguish our presentation
*  from all others.
*  He and Gidelli had talked about this, he said later.
*  There's really not a lot that separates the A-level shows anymore.
*  Everyone is trying to do the exact same show.
*  Competitors are certainly throwing money at the problem.
*  In addition to the billions they pay the NFL for rights, the networks in recent years
*  have shelled out huge sums to resign top broadcast booth talent and lure glamorous new
*  announcers.
*  In May 2022, Fox Sports announced that it had landed Tom Brady as the lead analyst for
*  its NFL broadcasts.
*  In a deal, said to be the most lucrative in television sports history.
*  They reported $375 million for 10 years.
*  The broadcasters engaged in this arms race are arguably fighting the last war.
*  The generations that have come of age with social media may not attach the same mystique or
*  fomo to a live event unfolding in real time.
*  Why bother watching the whole game when you can catch quick hitting highlights on an app?
*  A trend of disaggregation and downsizing can be seen across fan culture and sports media.
*  Fantasy football and prop betting view games through a splintered lens, pricing individual
*  stats and discrete in-game events over wins and losses.
*  There are alternative telecasts like ESPN's Manning Cast, starring Peyton and Eli, which
*  refigures Monday Night Football as a chatty hang with the bros and the NFL Network's Red
*  Zone, whose whip-around coverage offers viewers multiple games at once in split-screen formats.
*  The SNF model, airing one floodlit weekly game from opening kickoff to final whistle,
*  is by definition, DAUTY.
*  But for the time being at least, it's huge.
*  NBC tallied an audience of 27.5 million watching the kickoff game across broadcast and streaming
*  platforms.
*  It ranked as media's most watched prime time show since the last Super Bowl.
*  Three nights later, the whole operation had trucked to MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford,
*  New Jersey for Cowboys Giants, the show's first Sunday broadcast of the year.
*  It was a washout, a 40-to-nothing Cowboys route in the driving rain that found SNF
*  filibustering its way through a dismal second half with segments like a Melissa Stark report
*  about the leg tattoo of the Cowboys quarterback, Dac Prescott.
*  Yet, according to NBC, the game still earned a viewership of 22 million.
*  Through the first 11 weeks of the 2023 season, SNF is averaging 21.4 million viewers, a
*  7% increase from last year, and the show's best performance since 2015.
*  But it is not the way of Sunday night football to gloat.
*  Three days after Cowboys Giants, the production team was in Stanford, in the conference room
*  again, doing a post-mortem on its first two games.
*  That morning, Highland had sent an email to the staff that included his granular review
*  of the kickoff game Telecast.
*  He found many areas for improvement.
*  First four or five replays were a little late.
*  Chris was waiting.
*  Awkward silence.
*  Play action passed to Josh Reynolds.
*  Should have froze VT99 when the LBs stepped up.
*  Did not replay Mahomes scramble for first down before the end of the quarter.
*  Highland video needs to be addressed.
*  Rashi Rice reaction to commercial after the TD was not good.
*  Black virtual line of scrimmage line for the Chiefs looked terrible.
*  Mike was close to getting clipped out of breaks.
*  I want to be a little bit tough and thorough this first week.
*  Highland told the group in the conference room,
*  I just really want everyone to think about precision and execution.
*  There is a lot we can and must do better.
*  I know America probably doesn't even notice this stuff,
*  but we notice.
*  Right?
