*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverny-Sea, and this is The Daily.
*  President Biden arrived in Israel today as the crisis in the region deepened.
*  We have other breaking news, NBC news now learning between 200 and 300 people were killed
*  in a bombing targeting a hospital.
*  These are people who were likely being treated for injuries related to the war already.
*  After a devastating blast at a hospital in Gaza, ignited protests across the broader
*  Middle East.
*  Palestinians in the West Bank are very agitated.
*  Yes, there's chaotic scenes outside the US Embassy in Beirut, angry protesters, Lebanese
*  as well as Palestinians.
*  My colleague Edward Wong, on America's most difficult diplomatic mission.
*  Angers, not just toward Israel.
*  People are blaming the US administration.
*  Support its ally while also preventing a wider war.
*  It's Wednesday, October 18.
*  So Ed, we have a deteriorating situation in the Middle East.
*  You've been very focused on American diplomacy in this moment, and you've been traveling
*  with American officials all over the region for the past week.
*  Tell us what they've been trying to do.
*  Sabrina, this is the most intense diplomatic scramble I've seen among US officials in
*  the time I've been covering foreign policy and diplomacy in Washington.
*  And it's obvious because the stakes are very high.
*  The US wants to show full support for Israel, which is a very close partner in a region
*  where many countries have been hostile to it.
*  And there's this growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza as Israel carries out its airstrikes
*  and prepares a ground invasion there.
*  And on top of all that, you've got the possibility of this becoming a wider regional conflict.
*  And US officials are desperately trying to head that off.
*  So from the very beginning of this crisis, American officials have been involved.
*  We saw the US immediately come out and condemn the attacks by Hamas right after they took
*  place on October 7th on a Saturday.
*  And then over that weekend, there were a lot of intense discussions between President
*  Biden and foreign leaders in the region to really try and get them on board with a consistent
*  message about the attacks.
*  I know that the US officials and US leaders were intensely focused on showing strong and
*  unwavering American support for Israel at that time and for whatever Israel plan to do.
*  This military strike its retaliation against Hamas.
*  And they also wanted to speak with Arab leaders in order to try and persuade the leaders
*  to condemn Hamas and condemn the attacks and show as much support for Israel as they could.
*  And why was it so important to get Arab countries to sign onto this, to condemn the attack?
*  Well given the scale of the attacks, I think that the US felt they had an opening to try
*  and get Arab nations and Arab leaders on board with what Israel is about to do.
*  As you know, Sabrina, the Palestinians are seen as victims by many Arab citizens across
*  the region.
*  I would say that the majority of people who live in the Middle East see Israel as an occupier
*  and see America as the backer of this occupation.
*  So even an attack like the Hamas attack will be seen as justified by many ordinary people
*  in the region.
*  And I think that the US was hoping that the governments and the leaders of the region
*  would help set the tone, will help guide public opinion by coming out and being more forceful
*  in their kind of nation of these attacks.
*  So what happens?
*  Do any of them condemn Hamas in the attack?
*  Well there are a couple Arab countries that do come out strongly against Hamas.
*  Over that weekend to Monday, we see the United Arab Emirates put out a statement that
*  forcefully says Hamas was not right in doing these attacks in naming Hamas.
*  And we also see Bahrain, smaller country in the Gulf region, also put out similar statement
*  in naming Hamas.
*  And what's interesting is that these two countries had signed on a few years ago to what are
*  known as the Abraham Accords, which were these agreements that the Trump administration
*  really pushed in a diplomatic effort to try and get Arab countries to normalize relations
*  with Israel.
*  But Saudi Arabia, for example, makes a statement that essentially says, oh, we told you for
*  years that the Israeli occupation of Gaza would lead to reactions that you won't like.
*  Qatar, another Arab country, comes out with a statement that says Israel is solely responsible
*  for these attacks.
*  And that did not please US officials at all, of course.
*  Okay, so the US doesn't get much in this initial round of private calls, this initial
*  flurry of diplomacy.
*  What does it do next?
*  So on the Tuesday after the attacks, present binding comes out and gives what many people
*  describe as one of the most emotional speeches of his career.
*  Young people massacred while attending a musical festival, to celebrate peace, to celebrate
*  peace.
*  He forcibly condemns the attacks.
*  He describes in detail how horrific they are.
*  Families hid their fear for hours and hours desperately trying to keep their children quiet
*  to avoid drawing attention.
*  He evokes the history of persecution against Jews.
*  This attack is brought to the surface painful memories.
*  The scars left by a millennia vanisemitism and genocide of the Jewish people.
*  He tells Americans, we stand with Israel.
*  We will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself.
*  And he describes in the American people how he promised to the Israeli leader that the
*  United States would support Israel in whatever actions it takes.
*  It's atrocities.
*  It's sick of me.
*  Where with Israel is make no mistake.
*  Thank you.
*  Thanks Sabrina, that same day I was also getting a flurry of messages from the State Department
*  telling me to pack my bags because Tony Blinken, the Secretary of State, was about to go
*  on one of the biggest diplomatic trips of his career.
*  So publicly, this overwhelming support for Israel in this moment by the US.
*  But at this point, Israel has also started bombing in Gaza, right?
*  So how is the US viewing that?
*  And what's it seen to Israel about it, either in public or behind the scenes?
*  Well that's interesting Sabrina because this was something that I watched change as I was
*  following Tony Blinken around the region during this past week.
*  So when Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv, he put out a very strong message of unwavering and
*  unconditional support for Israel.
*  He stood next to Netanyahu and talked about how Israel had an obligation to defend itself
*  and that the US completely understood what Israel was about to do in Gaza.
*  But as Blinken is traveling around the region and going to visit with Arab leaders in a
*  total of around a half dozen Arab countries in the area, he hears a lot of concerns about
*  the civilian casualties.
*  And so I think that this really impacted the thinking of US officials and President
*  Biden and Blinken were talking intensely during Blinken's trip and we saw Blinken as
*  he stood next to Arab officials giving press conferences across the region, talking
*  more and more also about the need to address the suffering of the two million people in
*  Gaza.
*  Just to remind listeners here, Israel had shut off power, water and food to Gaza.
*  The bombing has been causing this deepening humanitarian crisis.
*  I'd imagine this was pretty worrisome to a lot of Arab leaders.
*  That's right Sabrina.
*  They really are pushing for the US to tell the Israelis, please back off from this cutoff
*  of water, this cutoff of Yolk Trasiti, this cutoff of food.
*  And we're seeing all these images coming out of people fleeing the cities of the rubble
*  and bodies being pulled out of the rubble.
*  And I know that US officials at this time were then really pressing the Israelis to start
*  restoring some of these basic services.
*  And were Israelis heating what US officials were telling them?
*  Were they doing that restoration of services?
*  Well, Netanyahu and his top aides felt justified in using the most intense forms of warfare
*  against Gaza.
*  I think that the magnitude of the violence that Hamas carried out in Israel, these terrorist
*  attacks really struck at the psyche of Israelis around the country.
*  You hear that when you talk with Israelis.
*  But they do start thinking about what the US officials are telling them.
*  What about food and supplies?
*  Well, Sabrina, there's only one land border crossing into Gaza and that's through Egypt.
*  It's a place called Rafa.
*  And so US officials start negotiating with people from different governments.
*  So they talk to the Egyptians.
*  The Egyptians say they definitely want to make sure that A gets through that border.
*  Israelis are very reluctant to open it.
*  They have argued that over the years Hamas has gotten weapons through that border and
*  they don't want that border to be open as they're waging war on Hamas.
*  They've even done some airstrikes dropping bombs right around the border.
*  And so the Americans are talking to Israel to try and get them to hold back from doing airstrikes
*  or bombing on that border and trying to persuade them that getting humanitarian aid to Gaza
*  is a valid effort.
*  And we have to also remember that it's not Israel that controls that border.
*  Hamas does control that border.
*  And so the Americans are also trying to pass messages via officials in Qatar to Hamas
*  to try and tell Hamas we want to bring humanitarian aid through and please open the border when the
*  trucks start coming through.
*  Qatar is a country in the Gulf that has in the past, past messages to Hamas had relations
*  with Hamas and is close.
*  Therefore that's how the US is communicating with Hamas.
*  That's right.
*  Another important point about this border is that American officials have been trying
*  to get Palestinian Americans out of Gaza via this border crossing.
*  So they've been trying to talk to these countries to open up the crossing to American citizens
*  with valid documents.
*  And we know that other governments are also talking with Egypt, with Israel to try and get
*  the border crossing open for their citizens too.
*  So Blinken is working on getting Americans out and aid in.
*  But what about everybody else in Gaza?
*  I mean, there are two million people there.
*  Presumably, some number of civilians there would leave if they could.
*  What about them?
*  Well, what we know is that Israel will do its offensive in northern Gaza.
*  They've been telling people in the north of Gaza to move down to the south.
*  And there's a lot of people who want to get out of Gaza through the south, through the
*  slam border.
*  But as American officials travel around the region and talk with Arab leaders, they're
*  discovering that the refugee issue is a very complicated one.
*  Arab nations are reluctant to take the refugees for various reasons.
*  They don't want a refugee crisis in their own borders.
*  But they also don't think that Israel should be forcing the relocation of Palestinians.
*  There are intense historical echoes of what happened decades ago to Palestinians.
*  And I was even hearing from Palestinians and Palestinians Americans who were outraged
*  by the fact that Israel was calling for people to move out of northern Gaza.
*  And also, they were afraid that once Palestinians left Gaza entirely, that they would not be
*  able to go back.
*  So there's a very complicated set of considerations here.
*  Okay, so the stakes are extremely high here, right?
*  I mean, two million gossens, they have nowhere to go effectively.
*  There's a worsening humanitarian crisis.
*  Israel is attacking from the air and clearly preparing for a ground invasion.
*  Is the US exerting pressure on Israel at all to ease its approach or even to reverse
*  its plans to invade?
*  Well, what we're hearing from your officials is that they're still fully behind whatever
*  offensive Israel's planning in Gaza.
*  They know that Israel has been deeply wounded in physical and spiritual and psychological
*  ways by the Hamas attacks.
*  And also that Israel needs to show its adversaries around the region, namely other militias and
*  Iran that it can protect itself.
*  And so the US feels strongly supportive of that.
*  And for example, we know that Pentagon officials are talking with Israeli officials about lessons
*  that the US has learned over decades of doing urban warfare and what fight in Gaza City
*  might entail.
*  But at the same time, we're also hearing lots of anxiety from American officials about
*  the prospects of a much wider regional war.
*  They think that once the ground invasion of Gaza starts and we see even bloodier images
*  that there will be massive concerns around the region and that other armed groups that
*  are supportive of Hamas will start taking part in the war.
*  And the US officials that I've been traveling with this week, one of their big pushes is
*  to really try and keep this war from becoming a huge regional conflict that could draw
*  the US in and put the US military squarely back in the Middle East again.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Ed, you said that the US officials you're talking to are very worried that this war
*  could turn into an even bigger conflict, one that spills out into the broader region.
*  Let's start to unpack that.
*  Well, Sabrina, we've been talking all this time about Hamas, which is this group that's
*  facing Gaza on the southern side of Israel.
*  But up in the north, Lebanon borders Israel and there Israel faces attacks from a very
*  powerful militia, Hezbollah, that space in South Lebanon.
*  And give us a primer on Hezbollah.
*  Remind us why it's such a threat to Israel in the US.
*  Well, Hezbollah has a very unique position in Lebanon.
*  There's a political wing that has seats in the government and there's also a very powerful
*  military wing.
*  This military wing has many fighters who are well trained.
*  They have thousands of rockets and they get a lot of backing from Iran, which is one
*  of the most powerful countries in the region.
*  In the 1980s, it carried out some of the most devastating terrorist attacks against US
*  interests.
*  It carried out a bombing of the American embassy in Beirut in 1983.
*  And it also carried out another bombing, this one of Marine barracks in Lebanon.
*  The US has designated Hezbollah as a terrorist organization.
*  And Hezbollah has similar to Hamas made its mission to fight in destroy Israel.
*  That's right, Sabrina.
*  But Hezbollah is the much more powerful actor.
*  It's better funded, it's better organized, it's fighters are better trained and its weapons
*  systems are more powerful and more sophisticated.
*  So Hezbollah, a militia in Lebanon, is similar to Hamas in many ways, including being funded
*  by Iran.
*  But it's also different because it's a more effective, more powerful fighting force.
*  And of course, it kept having wars with Israel, right?
*  Over that border into Israel's north.
*  I myself covered one of those wars in 2006 and it was extremely taxing for the Israeli
*  military.
*  Tied up their ground forces, took them weeks to extract themselves.
*  So it has been quite a force in Israel's north for many, many years.
*  But what about now with the attack on Israel last weekend?
*  We've seen an uptick in some of the exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah in the north.
*  So Hezbollah has been firing more rockets and Israel has recently told its citizens who
*  are living up in those towns bordering Lebanon to start moving south.
*  So knows that things could heat up very quickly there.
*  Okay, so there's been rocket fire since the attack on Israel.
*  How has the United States been viewing that?
*  Well, US officials are very anxious about this.
*  They're afraid that Hezbollah might decide to mount a full-on assault on Israel as Israel
*  carries out its war against Hamas in the south.
*  So the US is watching this very carefully.
*  And to try and deter Hezbollah from doing anything, it has sent two aircraft carriers to the
*  region.
*  One of them, the Gerald R Ford, is already there and the other one, the Eisenhower, is moving
*  there right now.
*  It's also sent a few thousand troops to the region, but it says that those troops for
*  now will not get involved in combat.
*  So the Americans are effectively reading the tea leaves of this bit of rocket fire that
*  started last week from the north, from Hezbollah.
*  They're worried about a wider war and they're sending these ships to the region, presumably
*  to try to stop that from happening.
*  Right.
*  US aircraft carriers are among the most powerful weapons in the US military system.
*  And other countries know that.
*  So the US is hoping that Hezbollah and its main backer Iran will read this and they'll
*  realize that if Hezbollah starts military assaults in northern Israel, that they will
*  incur a great cost.
*  And so they're hoping that there's a big deterrence factor to having these warships there.
*  But you know, we all know that Israel is planning a huge ground invasion of Gaza.
*  And if it goes into Gaza with troops and do street by street fighting, it could get
*  very bloody and very violent there.
*  We'll see many civilian casualties probably even beyond what we're seeing with airstrikes
*  right now.
*  And then Hezbollah might feel obligated or they might feel the desire to open up a northern
*  front there in Israel.
*  And many people who've looked at Israel's military say that military, even though it's
*  very well trained, is not powerful enough to fight a two front war.
*  And I think US officials are also wary of another scenario, which is Iran getting directly
*  involved.
*  That's one of their biggest fears.
*  Their assessment right now is that Iran doesn't want to get involved in a regional war.
*  But a downward spiral of events could end up drawing Iran into a war.
*  They can't discount that possibility.
*  Okay.
*  So these are some of the calculations that US policymakers are making.
*  And the big fear is that there will be a second front in Lebanon with Hezbollah.
*  Or even that Iran itself, Hezbollah's backer, would get involved.
*  What is the US doing to try to head this off?
*  Well, that's where we're seeing a lot of urgent diplomacy taking place.
*  So I witnessed that this past week as I've been traveling around the region with Tony
*  Blinken at his age.
*  We're trying to communicate to Iran.
*  They're trying to get partner countries, even some of the rivals to pass messages onto
*  Iran.
*  So for example, they've spoken about this with Qatar, which is a US partner.
*  And they're telling the Atari officials to talk to one of their other partners, which
*  is Iran, that Iran should hold back.
*  And there was even one day during his travels here when Blinken decided to call Wang Yi,
*  and his top diplomat, because he wanted to try and tell China to persuade Iran to stay
*  out of the fight.
*  So as we know, President Biden has made the choice to travel to Israel at this incredibly
*  sensitive moment.
*  What do you think he's trying to accomplish with this visit?
*  Well, Biden is trying to do several things.
*  He wants to show full support for Israel for the war that it's waging.
*  He also wants to make sure that Israel and other governments in the region commit to getting
*  humanitarian aid to the people in Gaza, that's becoming a much bigger crisis.
*  And he also wants to again send that message of deterrence to other adversaries of Israel
*  and say, I'm here, America's here.
*  And if you get involved in this war, then you'll feel America's wrath.
*  But of course, it's also a very fraught time for him to be going to Israel.
*  The airstrikes are intensifying in Gaza.
*  We're seeing many more images of civilians who've been killed in these strikes.
*  And just today, we got news that there was an explosion at a hospital in Gaza where hundreds
*  of people were killed.
*  And some of the images of the aftermath are absolutely horrific.
*  Hamas came out with a statement saying that this was the result of an Israeli airstrike.
*  And Israel has said that's not the case fighters in Gaza might have fired an air and rocket
*  that landed on the hospital.
*  Yeah, the video circulating online do, as you say, show these unbelievably horrific
*  images.
*  You know, clearly the details of what exactly happened there are still coming to light.
*  Israel has said it wasn't them.
*  But the images are out there circulating and make this an incredibly wrenching moment
*  for the Palestinians.
*  And Biden's trip is set to place him in the middle of this, which presumably makes his job
*  of preventing the conflict from spreading harder.
*  It definitely ties Biden and America much closer to this war that Israel is waging.
*  This war that Israel feels is justified.
*  But it will evoke a strong reaction from Arabs across the region and even from some governments
*  that the US usually relies on to be its partners in the region.
*  So Ed, I want to step back for a minute here.
*  You've just spent seven straight days traveling with American officials around the Middle
*  East.
*  They're racing to contain the threat of wider war.
*  How do you see this moment based on what you're hearing from them?
*  Well, I think it's a very anxious moment.
*  I think it feels like we're in the edge of an abyss potentially.
*  If this widenes into regional war, it could be the biggest event in the Middle East in
*  many years, perhaps since the American invasion of Iraq and the Arab Spring and those revolutions.
*  And I think that the American officials are very, very worried about the US getting involved
*  in another major war in the Middle East.
*  They know that our country has been scarred by these wars.
*  And some of the conversations that I've had with the US officials as I've been traveling
*  around with them have been among the bleakest I've had since covering this diplomatic
*  beat.
*  There is a very grim atmosphere.
*  They definitely know things could get much, much worse.
*  But also, these US officials tell me they need to stand strong with Israel.
*  They say Israel is a partner.
*  It's an ally and that America has promised to defend Israel through the decades against
*  its enemies.
*  And we started this episode asking how the US was getting involved in this conflict and
*  how it was trying to thread a needle, support Israel, even if it goes down the road to ground
*  invasion, while at the same time easing the humanitarian crisis and containing the broader
*  war.
*  In some ways, what we're seeing now, images from the hospital and the bombings of the past
*  week is potentially just the beginning.
*  So you're talking to officials, what price will US officials be willing to pay for this
*  support of Israel?
*  Well, the officials tell me that their support and their resolve is steadfast.
*  But I think what's going to happen is when you see that tested many, many times over
*  the coming weeks and the coming months.
*  This is just the start of the war.
*  The Israelis say they're ready to fight a long war against Hamas and against any other
*  adversaries that get involved.
*  And in these areas, there are many, many civilians.
*  And I think that both the Americans and the Israelis are gritting their teeth and saying,
*  we're going ahead.
*  But then the question is, as these images keep coming out and as public opinion starts to
*  turn more against Israel, how resolute will these American officials be?
*  Will they start to wonder whether they'll pay a political price, for example, for continued
*  support of Israel?
*  Will they decide they need to push back against some of Israel's military tactics in the
*  area?
*  I think these are all questions that will become even greater in relevance as this war goes
*  on.
*  Ed, thank you.
*  Thanks, Sabrina.
*  On his diplomatic trip to the Middle East, President Biden had planned to visit Jordan,
*  or he would meet with Palestinian leaders.
*  But on Tuesday afternoon, that summit was abruptly canceled after the blast at the hospital.
*  The situation deteriorated throughout the evening, with defiant crowds of protesters
*  clashing with security forces in Aman and in Beirut.
*  And in Iran, the country's foreign minister, who on Monday, had warned that multiple fronts
*  would open against Israel if attacks against Palestinians continued, said that time was up.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  The Tellers agree in their tallies that the total number of votes cast is 432, of which
*  the honorable Jim Jordan of the state of Ohio has received 200 votes.
*  With Jim Jordan of Ohio, the ultra conservative Republican, seeking to become the speaker of
*  the House, failed to win the job during a vote on Tuesday, when a determined block of moderate
*  Republicans blocked his path.
*  No person having received a majority of the whole number of votes cast by surname, the
*  speaker has not been elected.
*  The chair declares the House and recess subject to the call of the chair.
*  Jordan, an ally of Donald Trump, who led the congressional effort to overturn the 2020
*  election, fell 17 votes short of the majority he needed.
*  Not a single Democrat supported him.
*  And one of them, Representative Pete Aguilar of California, delivered an unusually sharp
*  rebuke of Jordan's record from the House floor.
*  A vote today to make the architect of a nationwide abortion ban, a vocal election denier, and
*  an insurrection insider to the speaker of this House would be a terrible message to the
*  country and our allies.
*  Jordan plans to call for a second round of voting this morning, but it's unclear whether
*  he can win over enough skeptical Republicans to secure the speakership.
*  If he fails, the House will remain leaderless and paralyzed.
*  Today's episode was produced by Ricky Novetski, Olivia Nat, Shannon Lynn, and Carlos
*  Prieto.
