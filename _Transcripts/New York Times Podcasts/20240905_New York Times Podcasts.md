# Kamala Harris’s Record on Immigration
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaMh0SD_5jM)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  As Vice President Kamala Harris moves into the final stretch of her campaign, one of
*  the biggest issues for voters and for Republicans attacking her is the surge of migrants across
*  the southern border over the past four years and her role in it.
*  Today, I talked to my colleague, Zolan Kano-Yums, about her record.
*  It's Thursday, September 5th.
*  So, Zolan, we're gearing up for the presidential debate next week, and one of the biggest issues
*  for voters is immigration. This is something that you and I have talked about a lot on the show,
*  and we've talked about how there has been this real spike in border crossings over the past few
*  years, record numbers, and Republicans are trying to pin those on Harris. So because we know
*  Republicans and Trump are going to keep attacking her on this issue, we wanted to come to you,
*  our expert, and ask you what exactly her record has been on immigration and what we know about
*  how she might approach that issue if she is elected.
*  Right. So we do know that Republicans at this point are aggressively trying to attach
*  Vice President Kamala Harris to the border crisis that existed for much of the Biden administration.
*  And we also know that a lot of voters, including supporters of the Democratic Party,
*  are trying to figure out and learn more about the Vice President on a variety of issues.
*  This is one of them. And while her role in the federal government was limited when it
*  came to this issue, just by looking at the Vice President's career, dating back to early 2000s,
*  when she was a prosecutor in California, we can start to get signs and indications of this leader's
*  approach overall to the border and immigration. Okay, so let's dig into that. Let's go back to
*  those early days of hers in California. What was her job? So Harris was elected District Attorney
*  of San Francisco in 2003. This was the start of her career as an elected official. And even then,
*  a part of her work was dedicated to immigration. I think most would describe San Francisco as a
*  liberal city. And when it came to immigration, it was also known as a sanctuary city. So that
*  basically means that it was a city that didn't want its local law enforcement to pursue immigration
*  enforcement. Right. This leads to an interesting situation with Harris, because at the time,
*  she actually locked heads with the board of supervisors over how to carry out that sanctuary
*  city policy. Harris, as well as the then mayor of San Francisco, Gavin Newsom at the time,
*  supported turning over juvenile undocumented immigrants if they were charged with committing
*  a crime. They would be turned over to immigration enforcement. Interesting. So essentially insisting
*  that they be turned over to federal agents who would presumably deport them, which is a pretty
*  hard line for a Democrat. Yeah, at the time in 2009, the New York Times reported that it resulted
*  in roughly 100 undocumented immigrants, younger undocumented immigrants getting turned over to
*  federal law enforcement. And you're exactly right for potential or even likely deportation.
*  Now, this got a lot of backlash from immigration advocates, also from the local board of supervisors
*  at the time, because those undocumented immigrants didn't need to have a conviction in order to be
*  turned over ties. So there were accusations that actually those undocumented immigrants were not
*  being given their full due process under law. But at the time, Harris said that this was necessary
*  to maintain cooperation with federal law enforcement and that a sanctuary city status didn't exactly
*  mean that you would issue sort of blanket protection for undocumented immigrants that
*  committed crimes. That being said, her position and her approach was nuanced. She also worked within the law
*  to also assist undocumented immigrants. So how did she do that? Tell me about that.
*  Well, I mean, one way is she she went after employers who she accused of abusing
*  undocumented immigrants by not paying them adequate wages. She also supported issuing
*  these sort of specialized visas for undocumented victims of violent crimes. And she denounced
*  proposed federal legislation that would have criminalized assisting undocumented immigrants.
*  So you are seeing somebody willing to pursue enforcement, but you're also seeing somebody
*  that's willing to work within the law to provide some humanitarian relief to undocumented immigrants
*  as well. So in other words, there are lots of sticks here. She's part of law enforcement, but
*  when it comes to her approach to immigrants, there are carrots as well. I think that's right. And
*  that's the approach that she would try to own when she became the top law enforcement officer
*  in the state, the attorney general of California, a border state, a state with some of the most
*  undocumented immigrants in the country, no longer just DA of sort of liberal San Francisco, but now
*  a large part of her responsibility was also how to approach immigration. So starting from about 2011,
*  when she's starting her career as attorney general, you saw Harris really start to focus
*  on the border and some of the criminal gangs and cartel organizations that she would say were
*  facilitating the illegal crossings at the border and exploiting migrants at the time, analyzing
*  different data trends and crimes committed by some of these transnational gangs and cartels.
*  At one point, she led a delegation of other attorneys general to Mexico to learn more about
*  cartels. So already you see somebody leaning into a law enforcement approach to tackle this issue.
*  Okay. So that's her California era. Then of course, she's elected to the US Senate,
*  which happens in 2016, which is the same year that former president Trump wins the presidency.
*  He of course, kind of redefines the issue of immigration by coming up with policies that are
*  pretty far to the right. How does she respond to that in her seat as Senator?
*  Sure. Let's just describe this moment that Harris is coming to Washington and the Trump administration
*  and those early days, they were issuing a flurry of executive actions to change the way our
*  immigration system worked. One of the more known examples were these travel bans that he issued,
*  including travel bans against Muslim majority countries. And I talked to some of the people
*  who worked with Harris when she was a Senator at the time, and they were saying, look, it was almost
*  as soon as she got in, there was a need to now respond to some of these policies, utilize her
*  connections in the legal world to pro-immigration advocates that she made connections with back in
*  California to work with them on opposing some of these policies. And then also publicly,
*  she became someone that was sort of known, particularly in congressional testimonies of
*  Trump administration officials, as somebody who would almost cross examine some of his top
*  immigration advisors. So this was of course, a period when the language we heard from Democrats
*  became pretty limited to combating Trump and all of his border policies, which of course brings us
*  to the primary campaign in 2019 and Harris's run for president. Yeah, I mean, look, Democrats during
*  the Trump era were on the defensive. And in that time period, so many Democrats, including Harris,
*  spent so much time investigating, criticizing, calling to question the Trump administration's
*  approach to immigration. That sort of grew to define the overall rhetoric from Democrats on
*  immigration, essentially not being Trump. And that carried over as well to the presidential
*  elections when it came to the different campaign platforms for each candidate. Democrats at that
*  time in 2019 and going into the 2020 election, most of the time they spent their time basically
*  saying how they would roll back Trump era policies or not do what he did. But there was a question
*  about what they would do. And in some cases, they moved even further to the left than we've seen
*  Democrats historically go on the border and immigration. I will also immediately put in place
*  a meaningful process for reviewing the cases for asylum. I will release children from cages. I will
*  get rid of the private detention centers. And I will. You see Harris criticizing a sweeping border
*  policy known as Title 42 that essentially turned migrants away without giving most of them the
*  opportunity to ask for protection in the US. You see her even at one point express support for
*  decriminalizing border crossings. Let me just be very clear. We have to have a secure border,
*  but I am in favor of saying that we're not going to treat people who are undocumented across the
*  borders criminals. That's correct. You see her saying that ICE might need to be overhauled as
*  well. Listen, I think there's no question that we've got to critically re-examine ICE and its
*  role and the way that it is being administered and the work it is doing. And we need to probably
*  think about starting from scratch. Right. She took on these very pro immigration stances as a primary
*  candidate. Right. But as we know, Harris's presidential campaign didn't last too long.
*  She dropped out pretty early on and she would later be picked as Biden's running mate. And
*  after coming into office, President Biden took a more hardline approach at the border than Democrats
*  in modern history have taken. And his vice president went right along with him.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Okay. So Harris becomes vice president and kind of takes up the party line of the Biden
*  administration on immigration. We know she had some role related to immigration in her job
*  as vice president. What did she actually do? Yeah. So the vice president had a pretty specific role
*  when it comes to this issue. For one, I think it's worth saying that it wasn't like the vice
*  president is the one who is deciding or shaping even the specific way to handle asylum seekers
*  at the U.S. Mexico border. She's not dictating border policy like at the actual U.S. Mexico
*  border. That's the Homeland Security secretary. That's not going to be the vice president's role.
*  What her role was, was essentially addressing the poverty and the corruption in what's known
*  as the Northern Triangle of Central America. We're talking about Guatemala, El Salvador,
*  and Honduras. And these countries for years had made up many, at times the majority of migrants
*  who were crossing the border into the United States. So her team describes this as addressing
*  the root causes of migration, the sort of societal systemic factors of poverty and violence that were
*  pushing people to get up and take that dangerous journey to the United States.
*  Okay. So she's tasked with this root causes mission. How does she tackle that?
*  So there's kind of a two part strategy to this role. You know, one is that she's tasked with
*  bolstering democratic institutions in this region. So what does that mean? That's pressing leaders to
*  ensure a free and fair election, right? Making sure that those who are fairly elected actually
*  make it to office, which was the case in Guatemala. And then the second is she's effectively a chief
*  fundraiser. A huge part of her role was essentially getting together all of these business leaders
*  that in the past might've been hesitant to invest in this region and using the office of the vice
*  presidency to encourage them to invest in this region with the ultimate goal of creating jobs
*  and training programs that could help some of the families that at that time were considering
*  traveling north to the United States.
*  So, okay, did it actually work to bring down immigration levels?
*  Yeah, the short answer is we really won't know for years. When I've talked to business leaders
*  that worked on this initiative, they told me and we're clear eyed that this was going to take as
*  long as maybe a decade, definitely not within one presidential term to see its full results.
*  And that speaks to just how daunting of a task this is. I mean, I went on that first trip in 2021
*  with Harris to Guatemala. And actually before she arrived, I got there before her and went to this
*  rural village in Huehuetenango in northern Guatemala, where there were plenty of families
*  that had relatives that had made that trek to the United States. And I asked them, was this initiative,
*  the vice president's involvement, encourage you to stay home? And they explained that their families
*  for generations had traveled to the U.S. and found a way to support their families. That's sort of
*  the generational cycle that you're going up against here if you're Kamala Harris. So it was
*  quite a daunting task. Right. But it also was at a time of sort of a global migration trend, a shift
*  in global migration, where we had more migrants coming from different parts of South America,
*  as far as Africa and China. Meanwhile, this strategy remained focused on the northern triangle.
*  So there was also some criticism that it was slow to adapt in a way. So basically, Harris did a fine
*  job of the task she was asked to do. But it's just that that task was never going to be all that
*  meaningful to the overall problem of too many migrants trying to cross into the United States.
*  Yeah, on its own, Harris's task was not going to be the sort of primary policy response to the
*  soaring number, the record number of illegal crossings that we saw in the short term. But that
*  being said, Harris was still a part of this administration. She was still the number two,
*  Biden's number two, when there were unaccompanied children and teenagers crossing in mass,
*  encountering squalid border detention facilities in 2021, and rising all the way towards this past
*  year where in December of 2023, remember, we were getting 10,000 crossings a day at one point.
*  The border and the administration's handling of immigration became a top concern for voters.
*  And you saw the Biden White House also respond to that pendulum shift, even working with a group of
*  conservative Republicans in the Senate to draft a Senate bill that would severely restrict asylum
*  at the southwest border. And we know, of course, the fate of that legislation, it dies, it's
*  torpedoed by former President Trump. Yep, former President Trump did not want the White House to
*  get this election year victory, which is how many saw it. So Trump torpedoes it. And then we see the
*  White House take action on their own and issue this executive order that is still in place today,
*  that did many of the things that that Senate bill would do, namely, restricting asylum,
*  restricting the ability for migrants to claim asylum, to get protection, to stay in the United
*  States. And look, you know, since that executive order was signed, we've seen border crossings
*  plummet. I mean, that could be for a variety of reasons. But without a doubt, since President
*  Biden, since the Biden White House issued this executive order, you've seen border crossings
*  plummet. Okay, so Harris inherits all of this once she becomes the nominee. But since that time,
*  she hasn't laid out a policy plan on the issue or given us a lot of detail about how she's thinking
*  about it. Are we to assume that her campaign approach is just basically what he said, you know,
*  like agreeing wholesale with Biden's policy? Yeah, you're totally right. We have not seen
*  Harris at this point issues sort of a comprehensive policy platform on immigration. But make no
*  mistake, the few times this has come up, the emphasis has been on border security. It has
*  been on sort of describing herself as the one person in the election that actually has investigated
*  transnational criminal organizations, cartel organizations. It's been talking about her time
*  as a prosecutor on the border. The choice is simple. Kamala Harris supports increasing the
*  number of border patrol agents. Democrats even issued an advertisement for Harris. Donald Trump
*  blocked a bill to increase the number of border patrol agents in which they talked about that
*  Senate bill that Trump torpedoed. So, you know, you're not seeing her talk about it all the time.
*  But the few times that she does talk about it, there's a similar sort of emphasis on what we
*  were hearing from President Biden. So, Zolan, stepping back from everything you've told me,
*  Harris doesn't really have the kind of record on this issue that would show us any kind of strong
*  stance on immigration and border policy. She just doesn't have it. You know, just like a lot of
*  things, she's kind of hard to pin down. And at the end of the day, her campaign policy is basically
*  Biden's policy. That's what you're saying. And that's the policy Republicans, of course,
*  are attacking. So, I guess I'm wondering, what do you think she would actually do
*  if she wins? Would a Harris White House just be Biden 2.0 on immigration?
*  It's tough to say for many of the reasons you just described. Harris has never been somebody that
*  sort of fits easily into a bucket. She's somebody that her aides have said when it comes to each
*  policy, and I think including immigration, wants to lean into the nuance and also wants to be
*  pragmatic and not worry about being described as pro-immigration or pro-enforcement or what have
*  you. I guess, though, the question is whether or not even that approach by Kamala Harris is one
*  that's meeting Americans where they are on this issue. I mean, make no mistake about it, this is
*  still a primary vulnerability for Democrats. After consecutive years of overseeing a record
*  level of border crossings, we know this is something that Republicans will continue to attack
*  her and Democrats in general on. What we do know, though, is that going into Election Day,
*  in a potential Harris administration, she would be the person now faced with these questions.
*  Throughout the Biden era, Harris has almost been shielded in a way by her limited role.
*  When the administration was faced with these tough questions about border crossings or about what the
*  way forward was just for the overall immigration system, including the legal immigration system,
*  Kamala Harris was able to say, I have a very sort of specific lane, a very specific piece of this
*  overall puzzle. Well, now the entire puzzle is going to be yours if you're president.
*  And all of those questions about the border, how you're deciding who gets in and who stays out,
*  and also just what the future is for this country when it comes to immigration. If she were to win,
*  she's going to be the person that's going to be making those decisions.
*  She can no longer say that's not my job.
*  That's right. She will no longer be able to say that this assignment, this issue is not her job.
*  Zolan, thank you.
*  Thank you. Appreciate it.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. On Wednesday, Attorney General Merrick Garland
*  announced that the Justice Department was beginning a broad effort to curb what it said
*  was Russia's attempt to influence the 2024 election. Garland announced the indictment of
*  two Russian employees of RT, the state-owned Russian broadcaster, for secretly paying a
*  company in Tennessee to spread English language videos which support the goals of the Russian
*  government. He also said that American authorities were seizing web domains that U.S. officials said
*  the Kremlin uses to spread disinformation. And a 14-year-old student opened fire at his high
*  school in suburban Atlanta on Wednesday, killing two students and two teachers before surrendering
*  to school resource officers. Officials said that the suspect would be prosecuted as an adult.
*  He has been on the radar of law enforcement officials for more than a year in connection
*  with threats of a school shooting posted online.
