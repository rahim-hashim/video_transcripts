# The Growing Republican Battle Over War Funding

*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverny-Sea, and this is the Daily.
*  It's been one month since the attack on Israel, but Washington has yet to deliver an aid
*  package to its closest ally.
*  The reason has to do with a different ally in a different war.
*  Today, my colleague Katie Edmondson, on the battle within the Republican Party, over
*  whether to keep funding Ukraine.
*  It's Tuesday, November 7th.
*  Katie, nice to see you.
*  Good to see you, Sabrina.
*  Where am I catching you?
*  I see some very, ornate mirrors in the background.
*  Yeah, it's my house, actually.
*  I'm in the Senate press gallery, which also I apologize for any noise in the background.
*  It's okay to ignore the noise, and we're going to just dive into it here.
*  We spent a lot of time over the past year talking about the many battles playing out on
*  Capitol Hill.
*  Of course, the most recent one was the fight among House Republicans over who would become
*  Speaker.
*  But the war between Hamas and Israel has created a whole new battle in Congress, and that's
*  over the question of funding foreign wars.
*  Israel is of course a very close ally of the United States.
*  As you know, normally we throw tons of money at our close ally, and no one would really
*  question it.
*  But it sounds like that's not what's happening right now.
*  Tell me what's going on.
*  That's right.
*  I mean, we're in kind of a striking moment where we're about a month in after the war broke
*  out, and Congress has yet to send any emergency aid to Israel, and actually at the moment is
*  not close to doing so.
*  The House introduced this sharply partisan bill for Israel funding last week, one that
*  basically was dead on arrival in the Senate.
*  And so they're kind of back to square one on this.
*  And why is that?
*  I mean, it's extremely unusual for Congress to be having these types of partisan fights over
*  emergency aid, especially to an ally like Israel.
*  But what I think, what we're seeing play out really reflects that it's a very fraught
*  moment politically on Capitol Hill when it comes to funding actually a different conflict,
*  which is the war in Ukraine, the war in Ukraine.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  So I think to really understand the dynamic of what's going on here, you have to look
*  back to a couple of weeks ago when President Biden gave an address in the Oval Office.
*  Good evening, my fellow Americans.
*  We're facing an inflection point in history.
*  One of those moments where the decisions we make today are going to determine the future
*  for decades to come.
*  Making the case essentially that it is imperative that America sends aid to Israel and continues
*  to send aid to Ukraine as well.
*  You know, the assault on Israel echoes nearly 20 months of war, tragedy, and brutality.
*  Inflict it on the people of Ukraine.
*  And so in that address, he's really linking these two conflicts together.
*  He's linking together the importance of aiding both Israel and Ukraine.
*  I'm awesome.
*  Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common.
*  They both want to completely annihilate in neighboring democracy, completely annihilate
*  it.
*  And tying those two together is a really important piece of his pitch.
*  American values, what make us a part of the other nations want to work with.
*  To put all that at risk, if we walk away from Ukraine, we turn our backs on Israel.
*  It's just not worth it.
*  The case he is really making in that speech was that this is an important moment for America
*  to lead to show that we support our allies and that we support our allies crucially in
*  standing up to tyrants and terrorists abroad.
*  That's why tomorrow I'm going to send to Congress an urgent budget request to fund America's
*  national security needs to support our critical partners including Israel and Ukraine.
*  I remember that speech, I remember watching it.
*  The idea was kind of American leadership is what holds the world together.
*  If Putin wins, that will only embolden Hamas.
*  These things are all connected.
*  But why did Biden feel the need to tie the two together?
*  Why was that important to do in the speech?
*  Well, it's two things.
*  Sabrina, one is exactly the ideology that you just articulated.
*  That is something that the White House truly believes.
*  But it is also nodding to a political reality on the Hill that has really complicated efforts
*  to continue sending aid to Ukraine.
*  That is among House Republicans, funding Ukraine, continuing to send military aid to Kiev
*  has become a politically toxic issue for a sizable number of lawmakers and their voters.
*  From the White House's perspective by linking together funding for Israel, which has strong
*  support in Washington right now, along with funding for Ukraine, the hope in the Biden
*  administration is that they can get more of these Ukraine's skeptics on board.
*  Okay, so Katie, let's dig into that.
*  You've just told me a growing number of House Republicans no longer want to fund Ukraine.
*  So break that down for me.
*  Well, I think that this is part of a larger trend that we started to see, honestly, when
*  former President Donald Trump came into office, which was really the idea among Republicans
*  that the idea of American leadership around the globe when it comes to foreign wars was
*  actually not a positive thing that if the U.S. is spending money, it should be benefiting
*  Americans rather than people abroad.
*  But I think we really saw this crystallize when it comes to the war in Ukraine over the
*  past year or two.
*  And so we're going to I travel across the country a fair amount to go to congressional town halls,
*  town halls that lawmakers have.
*  And almost every single time I have been to a town hall in a deeply conservative district,
*  congressional district, without fail, you will hear constituents extremely angry at the
*  idea of, you know, if I'm having trouble paying for my medication, if I'm having trouble,
*  you know, putting dinner on the table for my family, why are we sending all of this money
*  over to another country?
*  And so that is something that lawmakers, Republican lawmakers tell me that they hear all of
*  the time that they have really metabolized.
*  And you know, at the beginning of the war, we heard a lot of rhetoric from House Republicans
*  saying, you know, Putin is a tyrant, we can't allow this to happen.
*  You know, we're praying for those in Ukraine.
*  But the longer that this war has dragged out, we've heard less and less of that.
*  And we've heard more and more questions about what's the end game here, how much money
*  can we really be expected to send over there?
*  And a lot of it is really motivated by what they're hearing from their constituents.
*  I mean, it makes sense to some extent, right?
*  Because, you know, the counteroffensive in Ukraine has been going on for months.
*  The Ukrainians haven't taken much territory.
*  And you know, it's hard to get people excited about dumping a lot more money into what is
*  from their perspective, a losing battle.
*  Yeah, I think there's also a lot of PTSD among voters with respect to the wars in the
*  Middle East, Afghanistan, Iraq.
*  I talked to some Republican pollsters who have looked at this issue and what we also see
*  in the polls is that funding Ukraine, you know, with every month essentially becomes a
*  little less popular among Republican voters.
*  And of course, Republican lawmakers, particularly those up for reelection every two years, want
*  to be extremely responsive to that.
*  And increasingly, do not want to be seen taking an upper down vote on the House floor,
*  sending billions of dollars to another country.
*  And Katie, just to be clear, this logic of not wanting to send foreign aid to Ukraine,
*  you know, that the constituents are talking about, why doesn't it apply to sending foreign
*  aid to Israel in this moment for House Republicans?
*  Yeah, you know, it's a really complicated answer, but the bottom line for a lot of these
*  Republican lawmakers who are against continuing to send money to Kiev, but feel comfortable
*  or in fact support sending money to Israel is that they simply see Israel as being different.
*  They see it as a long time ally of the United States, one that because of sort of historical
*  background is important to support.
*  And so when they think about their support for Israel, it's a completely different calculation
*  than when they're thinking about Ukraine.
*  So basically, this Biden measure was kind of his way of trying to salvage funding for
*  Ukraine by writing on the co-tales of this sky high support that Israel has in Washington.
*  Basically saying to Republicans, you know, you guys, I know a lot of you aren't really
*  sure about supporting Ukraine anymore, but you can't say no to Israel, right?
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  But what you see from Speaker Johnson is that not only does he defy that request by deciding
*  that he is going to put just a standalone Israel bill on the floor, but he actually moves
*  to further spike Democrats on this vote.
*  And what we see in this bill is that he adds a provision to the bill that says in order
*  to pay for $14 billion of new spending and emergency aid for Israel, that they're going
*  to take back $14 billion that Congress previously had passed to help bulk up the IRS so that
*  it could recoup more tax money.
*  And that has the added benefit of being good politics for the Republican conference
*  because Republicans hated that landmark bill that President Biden passed the Inflation
*  Reduction Act.
*  And while Speaker Johnson says that he added this provision simply as a nod to fiscal
*  responsibility, we actually see him in interviews sort of dare Democrats, wink at Democrats
*  and say, you know, you're going to have to show us who you'd rather support Israel or IRS
*  agents.
*  So this move right off the bat infuriates Democrats and that anger only grows when the Congressional
*  Budget Office, which is a nonpartisan budget office, comes out and says actually this bill,
*  this offset that Speaker Johnson has been touting actually is going to grow the deficit.
*  It's actually not financially responsible at all because the government is going to lose
*  so much money from tax revenue.
*  So Democrats are basically like no way.
*  I mean, look, it's a tough vote for a lot of them because a lot of them do not want to
*  be seen as doing anything to undermine Israel particularly at this fraught moment.
*  But essentially the bill that Speaker Johnson created for them to vote on ends up becoming
*  toxic for most of them.
*  And of course, as you said, that bill was dead on arrival in the Senate, which is of course
*  controlled by Democrats.
*  That's right.
*  The powers before the House even took its vote, Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader
*  said that the Senate wouldn't even entertain the House past bill, that the Senate wouldn't
*  even try to amend it somehow and that senators would instead craft their own legislation
*  to fund both Ukraine and Israel.
*  And the interesting twist here really is that while over in the House, we saw Republicans
*  and Democrats bitterly divided over this bill crafted by Speaker Johnson over in the Senate,
*  there's actually kind of a rare meeting of the minds among Senate Republicans, Senate Democrats
*  and the White House when it comes to Ukraine funding, which is they want to keep helping
*  our allies in Kiev.
*  And that sets up what is likely to be a bitter rift within the Republican Party in the
*  weeks to come.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Katie, you said that there's a split among Republicans in Congress on this question
*  of war funding for Ukraine.
*  You know, House Republicans oppose it, but the Senate Republicans actually support it.
*  So, tell me about that.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  Obviously, there are a handful of exceptions, but largely what we've seen is that House
*  Republicans view this issue as being fairly toxic for them among their voters, whereas Senate
*  Republicans, many of them are really more sort of in the old-school style of establishment
*  or Republican who believes in sort of a muscular U.S. military presence abroad, believes in
*  the idea of the U.S. being a leader on the global stage, and really sort of all of those
*  viewpoints are most clearly personified in the leader of the Senate Republican Conference
*  Mitch McConnell, who has been really the most vocal Republican on the issue of the importance
*  of continuing to send aid to Ukraine.
*  So, Mitch McConnell is tying the two together in the same way that Biden is, right?
*  Israel and Ukraine and funding for them.
*  That's a real contrast with the new guard in the House that's pretty opposed to U.S.
*  interventionism and, you know, kind of less interested overall in foreign policy and
*  in foreign wars.
*  Absolutely.
*  McConnell sees this as being, I think, one of the most important political fights that
*  is currently on the world stage.
*  He has really taken it upon himself, and I think he sees this partially as something that
*  he wants to build into his own legacy as someone who may retire in the years to come simply
*  because of his age.
*  And so, he has really been traveling across the United States, across the globe, to try
*  to make the case to Republican politicians and Republican voters that sending aid to Ukraine
*  is a worthwhile investment.
*  And he has also been remarkably candid about how he is concerned by this sort of rising
*  wave of isolationist feeling in his own party.
*  I went in and talked with him in his office May of last year.
*  And essentially, what he said to me was not exactly in these words was I wanted to show
*  the world that the Republican conference, the Senate Republican conference does not adhere
*  to the isolationist viewpoints of former President Donald Trump.
*  And you know, for anyone who covers McConnell, those were such strikingly candid words coming
*  from him.
*  And I was honestly nearly fell out of my chair when he said that.
*  But I think this all points to the idea that he views this as an existential battle, that
*  he is willing to lay his own personal capital down on the line for.
*  And so this campaign from McConnell really picks up in the last couple of weeks.
*  Some say our support for Ukraine comes at the expense of more important priorities.
*  But as I said, every time I start the chance, this is a false choice.
*  He speaks in Kentucky, his home state, of course, with the Ukrainian ambassador to make the
*  case of why we should send more aid to Kiev.
*  The path toward greater security for all of us is simple.
*  Help Ukraine win the war.
*  And pretty much every single day on the Senate floor, he uses his daily speech.
*  The notion that this money is distracted from America's other security priorities is
*  not fair.
*  To again, make the argument that in fact, the fight in Israel is intertwined with the fight
*  in Ukraine.
*  And we have to fund both, that it would be folly to think that somehow they're not connected.
*  So at the risk of repeating myself, the threats facing America and our allies are serious
*  and they're intertwined.
*  And we ignore that fact we do so at our own peril.
*  And that Congress, again, must fund both Israel and Ukraine.
*  Now is not the time for the leader of the free world to go to sleep.
*  Okay, but he can't tell the House Republicans what to do, right?
*  I mean, after all, he is a senator.
*  Like how much does his position actually matter given the fact that the GOP in the House
*  does what it wants and really has been kind of its own chaos agent of late?
*  Well, look, I think that he sees and accurately so that he does have a bully pulpit as the
*  Republican leader in the Senate.
*  And it is clear that he is trying to use that to advance this argument that America should
*  continue helping our allies and keep.
*  That being said, I think you're right, Sabrina, that there are a number of House Republicans
*  who view him as being insufficiently conservative, who don't necessarily want to take his advice
*  for that reason on what legislation they should pass.
*  A number of House Republicans and the ascendant far right of the Republican House Republican
*  Conference view him as a rhino, which is Republican in name only, exactly sort of the most
*  derisive label you can slap on another Republican.
*  And so what that means is that McConnell's leverage really stays in the Senate.
*  It is about keeping his own Conference of Senate Republicans united around this idea
*  of funding both Ukraine and Israel.
*  And this matters because eventually these two chambers are going to have to negotiate
*  or compromise or come to some sort of version of legislation that they both can agree on
*  passing.
*  And look, when it comes to negotiations, the Senate will build up a lot of leverage if they
*  have a big block of bipartisan votes for one bill to fund both Ukraine and Israel.
*  So then how likely is it that this effort to get the House behind funding for Ukraine
*  will actually succeed?
*  Well, there are a number of different strategies, I think, that both Senate Democrats and the
*  White House and maybe even Senate Republicans are eyeing in an attempt to get House Republicans
*  to just swallow this bill that they really would prefer not to.
*  One is that we are coming up against a government funding deadline at the end of next week.
*  So I think there's one school of thought that maybe you try to just roll all of this up
*  into one big bill, a bill that keeps the government open, that funds Israel, and that also funds
*  Ukraine.
*  It's the idea of sugar to make the medicine go down.
*  And this time it's also keeping the government open, which Republicans don't really want
*  a shutdown right now.
*  So that is one option.
*  And of course, all roads lead back through Speaker Mike Johnson, right?
*  So what does that mean for the fate of all of this?
*  Well, there are a couple of different dynamics at play here.
*  One is that you have to remember that he is the very freshly elected speaker and that
*  the speaker before him, Kevin McCarthy was pushed out of the speaker's office because
*  he put two critical bills on the House floor for a vote and used democratic votes to push
*  them through.
*  You have to imagine those are two lessons that he's thinking a lot about right now.
*  Now at the same time, some of the public comments he has made, he has expressed openness to maybe
*  trying to pair Ukraine funding with border security funding.
*  So he's showing some signs of flexibility there.
*  But again, it is a potentially very treacherous path that he is about to walk down with really
*  no experience.
*  So look, I mean, this has been a crazy Congress with a lot of twists and turns.
*  I don't want to predict how this is going to end.
*  I do think at the end of the day, this is an issue that is so important for the White House,
*  for Schumer, for McConnell, even for a handful of Republicans over in the House.
*  I have to believe that they find some way to pass this, to get this aid for Ukraine through
*  and across the finish line.
*  But I think it's going to be a pretty bitter and messy battle.
*  And of course, aid to Ukraine is about a lot more than just another fighting Congress,
*  right?
*  It's about the biggest war in Europe since World War II that was started by Russia and
*  preventing a critical U.S. ally, Ukraine, from losing it.
*  And you know, we're coming to a moment in the war where it looks like there's actually
*  a danger of that.
*  The top commander there, General Zoluzhani, he told the Economist magazine last week that
*  his army was at a stalemate.
*  Like he actually used that word.
*  He said there be no, quote, deep and beautiful breakthrough like he'd been hoping.
*  And the reality is, American funding has been keeping Ukraine afloat in a pretty significant
*  way.
*  So if the U.S. doesn't continue it, Ukraine's fight against Russia could actually collapse.
*  I mean, not immediately, but it would happen.
*  Well, you're right to bring it.
*  And it's not only operationally important, but it's symbolically important, right?
*  If the U.S. pulls its support, then potentially you have other European countries saying,
*  well, if the U.S. isn't chipping in, why should we chippen?
*  I was actually reporting in Germany for a few months over the summer and at the end of
*  interviews with German politicians, I would say.
*  And is there anything about U.S. politics that I can tell you about or that you're interested
*  in?
*  And without fail, people would ask me about the fate of funding for Ukraine if Republicans
*  were to take the White House in 2024 if a Republican was to come into the White House in 2025.
*  And in a lot of their minds, I think that was going to be the moment where they had to
*  fear that maybe the plug would be pulled on Ukraine funding.
*  I think a lot of them have been surprised now to see that that debate actually has come
*  far earlier than they anticipated.
*  Right.
*  That patience for Ukraine and funding Ukraine could be running out sooner than European
*  allies expected.
*  And of course, that's exactly what Putin was counting on, right?
*  Our colleagues have reported multiple times.
*  This is a leader who understands that his competitive advantage is waiting out the West.
*  That he will always care more than the West about Ukraine.
*  And the West eventually will lose interest.
*  And it looks like maybe that's what's starting to happen.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  And that is really the challenge for McConnell and other Republican members of Congress who
*  want to sustain the flow of aid to Kiev.
*  And look, it's something that I'm sure they are hearing from their European counterparts
*  all the time, which is the idea of the U.S. choosing to now choke off the aid that it
*  sends to Kiev is simply a frightening prospect.
*  And would in some ways prove Vladimir Putin right?
*  That's right.
*  Katie, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Monday, Donald Trump took the witness stand for the first time in a civil trial in New
*  York, in which he is accused of significantly inflating his net worth to defraud banks and
*  insurers.
*  Trump, the leading Republican contender for the presidency, brought a combative campaign
*  in style energy to the courtroom in roughly four hours of testimony.
*  He attacked New York's attorney general, Latisha James, who brought the case as a quote
*  political hack.
*  He derided the proceedings as unfair and he scolded the judge overseeing the case, who,
*  for his part, appealed to Trump's lawyer to rein in the former president, saying quote,
*  this is not a political rally.
*  And the Israeli military said its forces had split the Gaza Strip in two after a night
*  of heavy airstrikes, a move that Israel said would make it more difficult for Hamas to
*  control the enclave.
*  Israeli officials made the announcement after two Israeli columns surrounded Gaza City,
*  which is densely populated in the northern half of the Gaza Strip, effectively cutting
*  it off from the South.
*  Israeli officials have described the city as a Hamas stronghold.
*  Also, the Gaza Health Ministry announced its latest casualty figures stating that in
*  the past month, Israeli airstrikes have killed more than 10,000 people in Gaza.
