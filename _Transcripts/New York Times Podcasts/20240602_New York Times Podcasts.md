# Introducing ‘Animal’: Walnut
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkBkP_xLJmo)
*  Hey, it's Michael.
*  Today we have something really special for you.
*  A blissful break from the news.
*  It's a new series from NYT Audio called Animal.
*  My colleague Sam Anderson from the Times Magazine traveled the world to have encounters with
*  animals not to claim them or to tame them, but just to appreciate them.
*  Each episode is a journey to get closer to a creature that Sam loves.
*  A bonus, you can listen to this series with your kids.
*  For the next 6 weeks, we'll be running this limited series every Sunday here on The Daily
*  Feed, but if you want to hear all the episodes right now, you can search for it wherever
*  you get your podcasts.
*  Today, episode 1.
*  Hope you like it.
*  Let me tell you a story about a hole.
*  A big gaping black hole in the floor of my house, upstairs, from the time when I climbed
*  up on a ladder to fix something in my daughter's room, and underneath me a floorboard cracked.
*  It opened up this freaky looking chasm, about the size of a burrito, but like a big burrito.
*  A burrito stuffed with pure darkness.
*  I'm honestly scared of this hole, and I was supposed to fix it before something bad happened,
*  but I kept putting it off.
*  And then, something bad happened.
*  What happened was, our daughter's hamster, Mango, escaped from her cage.
*  And she didn't just climb under a blanket or hide in a corner, she went down into the
*  hole.
*  And she was in this yawning vortex of doom.
*  Which means, she entered the secret infinite maze of the inside of our very old house.
*  Now, Mango was a fat little golden floofball.
*  Not the kind of creature who would survive long without fresh water and food.
*  We looked everywhere.
*  Occasionally, we thought we heard wrestling.
*  In a closet or under a dresser.
*  And we'd shine our lights in there.
*  Nothing.
*  24 hours passed.
*  48 hours passed.
*  We tried to go on with our normal routines.
*  But we all felt sad and on edge.
*  It was like the whole house had a toothache.
*  Finally, on the third day, we gave up.
*  We just had to swallow hard and accept the fact that our sweet little Mango, who'd been
*  our daughter's 16th birthday present, who used to nibble fresh raspberries right out
*  of our fingers.
*  Sweet little Mango had met her maker somewhere deep in the walls.
*  And someday there'd be a terrible smell or some home improvement project would uncover
*  her tiny tragic skeleton.
*  However, when I say that we gave up on Mango, I should actually say that the humans in our
*  house gave up on her.
*  Because late on that third night, when the rest of us were all past hope, a different
*  golden floofy creature came to the rescue.
*  Our dog, Walnut.
*  Walnut is a completely ridiculous creature.
*  A purebred, long-haired, miniature dachshund with thick, creamy fur like vanilla pudding
*  and a tail so fancy it should probably be on a tropical fish.
*  He's spoiled and lazy and he spends most of his time staring lovingly into my eyes or
*  napping in sunbeams.
*  But during the Mango crisis, while all the humans were busy grieving, Walnut suddenly
*  took a break from his napping and became obsessed with a small patch of our living
*  room wall.
*  He just stood there staring at it, pointing his long wiener dog snout and wiggling his
*  nose.
*  At first we ignored him because to be honest, Walnut's nose is probably too powerful for
*  his own good, so he ends up fixated on the tiniest things.
*  But he kept at it for hours.
*  He looked at the wall from one side, then from the other side, he cocked his head and
*  made little snorting noises, until finally we got the hint.
*  I took out my tools and disassembled this ancient set of sliding doors in the wall to
*  expose a dark cave.
*  We put an open peanut butter jar on the floor as bait and we all held our breath.
*  A few minutes later, out staggered Mango.
*  She was filthy, covered with the grime of the centuries, probably starving and dehydrated,
*  but she was alive.
*  She looked like she'd climbed out of her own grave, which basically she had.
*  We picked her up and dusted her off and put her back in her cage.
*  And we all showered Walnut with extra love and praise and snuggles and treats.
*  And then he went back to sleep.
*  We humans tend to think of ourselves as superior, with our pants and our phones and our skyscrapers.
*  But I believe, I have always believed, that animals are basically magic.
*  These creatures that are so obviously not us, but that exist right alongside us, sleeping
*  in our beds, munching grass on the side of the road, rattling their tails, fearing us,
*  loving us, biting us.
*  They enter worlds we never see.
*  They sense things we can't detect, like how Walnut, just by being Walnut, rescued Mango.
*  In his lazy, snuffly way, he performed a resurrection.
*  In fact, Walnut himself came into our lives as a sort of resurrection.
*  He was our second wiener dog, a very deliberate replacement of our first, whose name was Moby.
*  I'm not going to say too much about Moby here, because to be very honest, I will start
*  weeping so hard it'll ruin all of this nice audio equipment.
*  But basically, Moby was the greatest dog of my life, in the most profound non-human relationship
*  I've ever had.
*  I loved him so deeply that I became a vegetarian.
*  My affection for this little dog radiated out to cover the whole rest of the animal
*  kingdom.
*  And I just thought that he and I would be together forever.
*  But of course, that didn't happen.
*  When Moby turned 12, he got cancer, and very suddenly died.
*  And it was a complete shock.
*  That first night in bed, I reached out for him, just pure muscle memory, and there was
*  nothing there, and I broke down sobbing.
*  At one point, I found myself petting a photograph of his face.
*  I was also full of rage.
*  I wanted to burn down the universe.
*  I either wanted Moby back, which I knew was impossible, or I wanted nothing.
*  No dog ever again.
*  Because life seemed to be some kind of scam, a little shell game, in which every living
*  thing secretly carried the pain of its own loss.
*  And I was determined never to fall for it again.
*  This is when my wife, Sarah, went out and brought home Walnut.
*  He was from the same breeder as Moby, and in fact the same bloodline, a descendant of
*  Moby's father's brother's cousin or something.
*  And Walnut was outrageously cute.
*  Big-eyed, fuzzy, clumsy.
*  Strangers gasped when they saw him in the street.
*  Friends threatened to steal him.
*  The rest of my family needed zero seconds to love Walnut completely.
*  But he was not Moby.
*  He was a different color, with long fur instead of short.
*  He didn't cuddle in bed like Moby, didn't walk on his leash like Moby, he didn't make
*  little huffing noises while he mashed his forehead into my chest.
*  Also Walnut barked at everything.
*  And so for a long time, I did not love him.
*  But day by day, Walnut wore down my defenses.
*  He molded himself to my habits, and I molded myself to his.
*  And eventually I accepted him.
*  Then I started to love him.
*  And today, it actually hurts me to say this, but I think I love Walnut as deeply as I loved
*  Moby.
*  Differently, but as much.
*  Which means that I have fallen, yet again, like a total sucker for the stupid trick of
*  life.
*  And inevitably, terrible pain is on its way.
*  Because Walnut just had a birthday.
*  He turned 12.
*  The age Moby was when he died.
*  The hair on his face has turned white.
*  But the hair on my face has turned white too.
*  I'm no longer soft and unsuspecting and naive.
*  And not just because of Moby.
*  A few years ago, out of nowhere, my father got a horrible illness and died.
*  Right before the global pandemic that killed millions of other fathers and mothers and
*  sisters and brothers.
*  Every month now, there seems to be some new, terrifying report about the decline of the
*  whole planet.
*  And so every morning, as I drink my coffee, I run my fingers through Walnut's luscious
*  fur and I think about the fact that he will soon be gone.
*  And then I think about the fact that I too will be gone.
*  Because all the other living things on this planet that I've loved and admired, they'll
*  also be gone.
*  Because we will all eventually slip into that great cosmic hole in the floor.
*  And there will be no Walnut to rescue us.
*  And I have no idea what to do about that.
*  Except pet my dog.
*  Which feels very anchoring.
*  The truth is, we are all animals.
*  We are born, we grow up, we grow hair, we age.
*  Some of us produce other animals.
*  And they are born.
*  They grow up.
*  They watch us lose our hair.
*  Eventually we all die.
*  And we do all of this surrounded by millions of other creatures, human and non-human, who
*  are each doing their version of the same thing.
*  That trajectory is sad.
*  Nothing we can do about it.
*  But instead of just feeling sad or trying to burn down the universe, I am choosing a
*  different path.
*  I've decided to go out into the world.
*  To have a series of encounters with other creatures.
*  Animals who do not live in my house.
*  Not to claim them or tame them, but to do something much simpler.
*  To just be near them.
*  To look into their eyes and see what I can see.
*  Right there.
*  Right there.
*  And they're all over.
*  While we're all still here to see it.
*  They're everywhere.
*  You got one!
*  Wait, what happens if I put my fingers in that bottom heat?
*  He will probably fight you.
*  To the bone.
*  To the bone?
*  We got a loose parrot!
*  The tummy is up!
*  Are you safe?
*  Yes!
*  I'm going really close to my head.
*  Is that your blood or it's blood?
*  I think it's mine.
*  I guess what I'm asking is for you to improvise a song about rescuing pufflings.
*  Searching down in the darkness below.
*  For the puffins of my soul!
*  Something like that.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sam Anderson.
*  This is Animal.
*  That's it!
*  Hey!
*  Woo!
*  Look at them!
*  Also, I've still not fixed the hole in the floor.
