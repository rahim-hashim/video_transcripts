# Secure the Border, Say Republicans. So Why Are They Killing a Plan to Do That?

*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro. This is The Daily.
*  For the past few weeks, Democrats and Republicans were closing in on a game-changing deal
*  to secure the U.S.-Mexico border. The kind of bipartisan compromise that's unheard
*  of in contemporary Washington. Today, Karen D'Amersha on why that deal is falling apart.
*  It's Thursday, February 1st.
*  So, Karen, we're here to perform a kind of autopsy on a deal that might have been to talk
*  about a major bipartisan immigration agreement that took form over the past few weeks.
*  It was championed by President Biden, leaders from both parties in the Senate to understand
*  exactly why in a divided dysfunctional Washington. It ever seemed like it had a chance
*  to become law and why in the end it seems to have been derailed. So, where does that
*  story start?
*  So, the genesis of all of this is really late last summer. When it starts to look like
*  military assistance for Ukraine, which the United States had been funding and giving to
*  this ally since early 2022 to help them fight off a Russian invasion, is about to dry up.
*  It had never been completely easy, but it had never been a really serious challenge to
*  get this sort of money through Congress in various tranches in the past year and a half.
*  Right.
*  But all of a sudden, the right wing of the Republican Party starts to get really, really stubborn
*  about saying we're not going to let you have this money unless you give us something that's
*  important to us in terms of national security. And that is more border enforcement on the
*  Southern border with Mexico.
*  Hmm. So, Republicans in Congress say to the president, you want that funding to Ukraine
*  to be consistent the way it has been, you're going to have to give us greater security
*  on the US-Mexico border.
*  Exactly. It's a completely unorthodox sort of a linkage. The logic that has been presented
*  is that they're both kind of national security type issues, but the idea of linking the
*  Ukraine war to border security, it's fairly novel. And it's born out of the political priorities
*  of the people who are pushing for that. The same group of Republicans that starts this
*  push for more border security measures, more enforcement, they also just so happen to
*  be the people who never liked the idea of sending all of this aid to Ukraine in the first
*  place.
*  Got it.
*  And it only takes a couple of weeks before this talking point that originated in the right
*  wing of the Republican Party.
*  But I am not inclined to support any more you help to Ukraine at this time. If we want
*  to take care of an invasion, we've got an invasion on that southern border.
*  It kind of takes over the entire mainstream of the party.
*  I'm for better security in our border. I'm also for supporting Ukraine. I feel like we've
*  got a negotiated decent tandem.
*  And you have many prominent Republicans in the Senate too.
*  Are you saying Ukraine should not be a standalone?
*  It will not be a standalone.
*  Saying we're not going to let Ukraine aid get renewed unless there's border security
*  alongside of it.
*  And things actually do hit a deadline at the end of September where this emergency aid
*  that's been flowing for Ukraine since the beginning of the war, they don't actually
*  reauthorize it on time.
*  Hmm.
*  And so all of a sudden, there's this pause and everybody in the Democratic Party starts
*  to panic.
*  You're saying Republicans put their money where their mouth is and they say, this is
*  not just a talking point, you're not going to get this aid for Ukraine at all.
*  We are serious.
*  Yeah. And after this, it becomes very clear that Ukraine funding is not going to go ahead
*  unless there are some border security measures attached to it.
*  That leads President Biden in a little bit of a bind because he has staked a lot of his
*  legacy reputation on this Ukraine war.
*  And it is the biggest success of his foreign policy.
*  And so he takes this very unorthodox, very surprising step of basically saying, okay, I'll
*  meet that demand.
*  I will tie these two things together.
*  And I cannot overstate how much of an earthquake it is that Biden actually took that step to
*  say, I will accept the GOP's ultimatum as legitimate and actually come and try to meet
*  it. Well, just explain that why is that such an earthquake given that you just described
*  this as a kind of impossible bind for Biden?
*  Well, it flies in the face of basically three or four decades worth of what Democrats
*  approach has been to border security, which is that it's part of a bigger conversation
*  about immigration policy that has to involve things like pathways to citizenship or putting
*  more visas for family reunification on the table or something that isn't primarily policing,
*  processing and shutting things down.
*  And that's been the case going back to basically the Reagan years since that's the last time
*  Congress actually managed to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill to split off border security
*  and say, oh, we'll do it alone.
*  And we won't ask for anything really on the immigration front.
*  That is breaking with a whole lot of precedent that frankly, a lot of the Democratic party
*  saw as president Biden selling out on something that was pretty fundamental to how they approach
*  this issue.
*  You're saying this is revolutionary because it violates a longstanding democratic approach
*  that they will negotiate around reducing migrant crossings at the border.
*  They will strengthen border security if and only if their approach to immigration is
*  kind of met halfway by Republicans.
*  And in this instance, Biden is instead agreeing to negotiate a tougher approach to the border
*  without such halfway meeting from the other side.
*  Instead, he's just doing it to get money for Ukraine.
*  Exactly.
*  And that is why several Democrats see this as him basically selling out immigrants and
*  giving up all the leverage that they might have on border security to get money for the
*  next nine months for Ukraine.
*  However, President Biden and the Democrats who support him see this as a potential opportunity.
*  Yes, Ukraine is a problem.
*  A big problem.
*  But so is the border.
*  They are seeing the surge of migrants come to the border.
*  They are seeing how many are being bust internally into the country.
*  They are seeing how tens of thousands are flooding the streets of democratically run cities
*  like New York.
*  Right.
*  And they know that that's a huge political liability for President Biden if he doesn't do something
*  to address it before the November elections.
*  And so tying these two things together basically gives him a potential opportunity to address
*  two big issues with one stone if it works.
*  So one spyden takes this very unorthodox approach to funding border security in order to get
*  this money for Ukraine, what ends up happening?
*  So this creates an opportunity for a potentially huge deal on the border.
*  Along shot, the type of deal that is alluded Congress for several decades at this point.
*  And a core group of three senators starts entering this very intense phase of negotiations.
*  They meet on a near daily basis for months.
*  And eventually they actually do coalesce around a set of policies that they think could work
*  to actually clamp down on the migration problem at the border in a way that both parties
*  could stomach.
*  And what do they end up agreeing on?
*  They agree that they need to make it harder for people to claim asylum.
*  There's a lot of people making frivolous asylum claims who don't actually fear persecution
*  if they go home.
*  So they agreed to raise that bar.
*  They agree to expand the capacity of detention facilities because a lot of the Republicans
*  complains are that you're letting all these migrants just run off into the country with
*  no guarantee that you can bring them back to deport them later.
*  They should be in detention centers.
*  So they agree to do that.
*  And kind of most critically, they agree to basically limit the number of people they can
*  come into the country on any given day.
*  And the way they envision doing that is if the number of migrants that border patrol officers
*  encounter reaches an average of 5,000 per day, it would trigger an effective shutdown of
*  the border.
*  That might sound like a lot 5,000.
*  It's actually far fewer than what we see now.
*  Late last year there was an average of about 8,000 people trying to cross in every day.
*  So this trigger functions as a fail safe.
*  That if all these other measures they're putting out there can't bring down the number
*  of migrants coming to the border.
*  At least there's this that would actually shut things down.
*  So taken together, this seems like a pretty restrictive set of policies at the border and
*  a lot like a Republican approach.
*  And you're saying this is what a bipartisan group of senators comes around to.
*  So on top of starting off where Republicans wanted Biden to start off in these negotiations,
*  Biden and Democrats seem to be willing to sign off on a bill that is very much out of
*  line with traditional democratic approaches to the border and immigration.
*  Good afternoon everyone.
*  I'd like to speak to you today about an urgent responsibility the Congress has to hold
*  the national security needs in the United States.
*  They definitely are.
*  We need real solutions.
*  I support real solutions of the border.
*  President Biden comes out and says we need this deal, get this done in terms of changes
*  of policy and provide resources that we need at the border.
*  I'm really going to change policy as well.
*  And that he's willing to make very serious pretty major concessions.
*  In the Senate, we see Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer put pressure on the Senate.
*  If we believe something is important and urgent, we should stay and get the job done.
*  Schumer even goes so far as to try to hold the Senate until the holidays in the hopes
*  that can speed together the end of a deal.
*  Members need to be here next week.
*  We have to get this done.
*  And it's not just the Democrats.
*  Republican leaders are saying to themselves, this is an opportunity that's never going
*  to be repeated where you have Democrats this willing to make this kind of a deal.
*  We should take it and run with it and try to make this work.
*  And so, as you're nearing the end of 2023, getting into the beginning of 2024, it actually
*  seems like it's a possibility that there could be the votes for this deal if they can just
*  finalize it in the Senate.
*  But it's a very different story in the Republican-led House, which has been much more skeptical
*  of a deal.
*  And it's a very different story as former President Trump, who's still really the leader
*  of the Republican Party, starts to rack up primary wins in Iowa and New Hampshire, and
*  starts weighing in on this deal in very unsavory terms.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Karen, tell us exactly how, at this moment of maximum possibility that this bipartisan
*  immigration deal starts to unravel.
*  As we get into the New Year, the opposition from the House starts to get much more solidified.
*  You'd had a situation where basically, Mike Johnson, he's a new speaker, he starts in
*  his office at the end of October, just as all this stuff about the border negotiations
*  in the Ukraine deal is just picking up in the Senate.
*  And for a while, he's sounding like he might be open to it.
*  But by the time you get to the beginning of the New Year...
*  Yeah, we have a humanitarian catastrophe here, and of course, huge national security concerns.
*  He is actually down on the border.
*  If you don't in-catch and release as a policy, if you don't, re-institute remain in Mexico.
*  If you only fix asylum or parole and not these other things, then you don't solve the problem.
*  You don't stand on it.
*  Saying that he doesn't think that this has legs, that it does not go far enough to secure
*  the border.
*  We're just asking the White House to apply common sense, and they seem to be completely
*  un-interested in doing so.
*  And that's the point at which it becomes clear that he has fully thoroughed on the deal.
*  And how much do you covering this take that motivation at face value?
*  What's really going on?
*  I mean, if the Democrats have come this far and Senate Republicans are pleased and pushing
*  for a deal, what's really keeping the House speaker from seeing this as an opportunity
*  as well?
*  Well, the House speaker does come from the right wing of the GOP.
*  He isn't inclined to say, look, we need a lot of really draconian restrictions on the
*  border to make sure that it's actually enforced.
*  But there's another element it plays here, too.
*  The so-called border security deal Biden is gushing out and pushing out is not designed
*  to stop illegal immigration.
*  Trump, who, as we said by mid-January, has reclaimed the mantle of the GOP from winning
*  these primary contests.
*  And he is the leader of our party.
*  There is zero chance I will support this horrible open borders betrayal of America.
*  And he is openly using that pulpit to trash this emerging deal.
*  And tell Republicans to vote against it.
*  I'd rather have no bill than a bad bill.
*  A bad bill you can't have.
*  And that's what was happening in the House.
*  And why?
*  I mean, what is his reasoning for trashing a deal that starts to fulfill something so
*  central to his identity as president, which is get tough on the border?
*  Part of it is that the deal doesn't go as far as he would like to see it go.
*  It doesn't restore all of the policies like remain in Mexico and border wall construction
*  that he had pursued during his presidency.
*  But part of it is also that he doesn't want to give Biden a win on this.
*  It's an extremely compelling political campaign issue for him with his base.
*  And if the Senate makes a bipartisan deal and a bunch of Republicans are endorsing that
*  bipartisan deal, it becomes harder for him to say Democrats don't want to secure the
*  border.
*  Reelect me.
*  So in a very real sense, Trump is trying to torpedo this, we suspect, because he wants
*  to make sure that a huge issue so animating and central to his campaign and his base remains
*  an issue that's animating to his campaign and to his base.
*  If he lets this deal happen, he can no longer run against a Joe Biden who hasn't done
*  something about the border.
*  Exactly.
*  And he and his supporters are very committed to keeping that tool alive for the next
*  several months.
*  But help me understand the power of what Trump is up to here.
*  Because at this moment, yes, he's Donald Trump, a very influential leader within the
*  Republican Party, but he's nonvolved in the negotiations.
*  He's not president.
*  He might not win and become president.
*  So just how meaningful is his message to these House Republicans?
*  It's extremely meaningful because it's not like Donald Trump is on an island thinking
*  this way.
*  By weighing in here, he's exploiting a divide that was always there in the GOP.
*  You had the right wing of the party, very, very skeptical because they want to do more.
*  And then you had a part of the party that was saying, hey, let's make a deal.
*  So Trump coming in and catering to the base on this is kind of exactly what Trump always
*  does.
*  And once he does exploit that gap, it not only reinforces the anti-deal sentiment that
*  was already there in the House, it starts to turn Senators cold on the idea of a deal
*  too.
*  And it trickles all the way up to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who tells a room
*  full of Republicans, as the deal is getting very, very close to being done, look, we're
*  in a quandary here.
*  We are potentially voting against the person who's going to be the GOP nominee.
*  And so we have to decide, are we going to vote with what Trump wants or against it?
*  And judging by the fact that McConnell said this to a room full of Republican Senators,
*  I suspect he is in doing so, revealing the answer, right, that you really can't vote
*  against the party's nominee.
*  Yeah, he is admitting to the reality that they're in, which is that you can't do this without
*  there being heck to pay on the campaign trail.
*  And that could blow back on a lot of his members if they decide, no, we're going to put our
*  heads down and plow through with this.
*  And it's around this point where McConnell shows he's wavering, he's willing to be swayed
*  and not lead his party through this, that Johnson jumps back in and says, this is dead
*  on arrival, if it comes to the House, which in a way creates even more pressure on
*  Senate Republicans who start saying, look, if this doesn't have a future, why should we
*  stick our necks out for this deal?
*  So is it correct to say that that is the moment when this almost major bipartisan deal
*  basically collapses?
*  I think the next two days are going to tell whether Trump has successfully torpedoed
*  it or whether there's going to be a schism in the GOP because some senators decide not
*  to let him completely torpedo it.
*  But yeah, ultimately speaking, the fate of this bill is slim to none in Congress because
*  Trump has reinforced the House's inclinations and that has created back pressure on Senate
*  Republicans just say, no, not now, not good enough, not this year.
*  What is the reaction from President Biden to this turn of events into the kind of rapid
*  deterioration of this deal?
*  So President Biden does something kind of interesting.
*  Two months ago, my team began to work with a bipartisan group of senators to play the
*  game together, the toughest, smartest, fairest, border security, Bill and history.
*  He starts talking really tough about the border and saying, that bill with the law today,
*  I'd shut down the border right now and fix it quickly.
*  Give me this deal.
*  If you give it to me, I will shut down the border.
*  It is the sort of talk that you'd expect to hear, frankly, from a big border enforcement
*  guy, which is not how President Biden started off his term.
*  He's the guy who campaigned on a humane approach to immigration and now he's saying,
*  I'll shut it all down.
*  And so in a way, it's like he's trying to enter the ring that Trump is already in and
*  basically outflex him on how tough he can talk about the border.
*  So at this point, what happens to the two very substantive questions at the center of
*  this bill and this compromise?
*  What happens to funding for Ukraine and what happens to this effort to secure the border
*  if this bill now seems to be going absolutely nowhere?
*  That is the big question, right?
*  Because when this all started, Republicans set this quid pro quo of no Ukraine aid without
*  the border deal.
*  If they don't accept the border deal that the bipartisan team of negotiators came up with,
*  either they've got a reneg on that position that got this ball rolling in the first place
*  to make sure that more Ukraine aid can get out the door or they've just got to say,
*  yeah, we're comfortable with that.
*  We're comfortable with the fact that the United States is going to pull it back on support
*  that maybe the rest of the Western world will follow and that that means Russia could
*  overwhelm Ukraine on the battlefield.
*  For Democrats, there is very little incentive to give the Republicans any of these border
*  enforcement measures without securing that Ukraine aid.
*  That was the whole reason that they agreed to go into this negotiation in the first place.
*  The result of that is basically going to be maintenance of the status quo, which is a
*  little bit bleak, given the fact that leaders of both parties have acknowledged the situation
*  and the border is not tenable and something has to be done about it.
*  It feels like at the end of the day, this is really the story of a Democratic president
*  being willing to meet his Republican congressional peers much more than halfway on a very sensitive
*  issue, the border and immigration.
*  The response from those congressional Republican peers is to reject the offer.
*  Not it seems fundamentally because of the policies at hand, but because of the politics
*  at hand because Donald Trump told them he doesn't like the deal and they said, well, if
*  you don't like it, we don't like it.
*  What does that ultimately tell us?
*  I think it tells us that what Republicans want here is either an entirely Republican solution
*  that looks like a resumption of the policies that President Trump implemented on the border,
*  which is a big ask when you only control the House of Representatives and Democrats
*  control the Senate and the White House.
*  They want to be able to preserve the ability to blame the Biden administration.
*  We've talked about how that's likely to play out and already is playing out on the presidential
*  election circuit.
*  It's also playing out within the House of Representatives, which is currently trying
*  to impeach Alejandro Mayorkas, the Homeland Security Secretary, effectively for failing
*  to shut down the border.
*  Frankly, a lot of conservative legal scholars are also calling not a good impeachment,
*  something that does not actually rise to the level of that indictment and punitive action.
*  That's what they're choosing to do.
*  That is very much sticking your finger pointing it at the Biden administration and saying,
*  this is your fault.
*  We want you guys to take the personal hit for this.
*  We want to prioritize that over any sort of down payment on trying to make these policies
*  fix, is that maybe we could build on if we had a Republican president next.
*  That seems to be the prevailing wins in the GOP.
*  That win is no deals.
*  Even if the deal is on something that the Republicans say they care about and want, because they
*  would rather be able to blame the Democrats.
*  Yeah.
*  Unless they get everything that they want or practically everything that they want, maintaining that
*  ability to say it's your fault is worth more.
*  And that's just a reality of the political time that we're in, but it's also just a reality
*  of how messily divided things are in Congress and how impossibly hard it can be to chart
*  a middle way.
*  Well, Karin, thank you very much, we appreciate it.
*  Thank you so much.
*  We'll do it back.
*  Here's what else you need, Senator Day.
*  Online child sexual exploitation is a crisis in America.
*  During a high profile hearing on Wednesday, senators from both parties interrogated the
*  country's most powerful tech executives about why their platforms have allowed for the
*  spread of child sexual abuse material.
*  The subject of a major times investigation in 2019.
*  Instagram displayed the following warning screen to individuals who were searching for
*  child abuse material.
*  These results may contain images of child sexual abuse and then you gave users two choices.
*  Get resources or see results anyway.
*  Mr. Zuckerberg, what the hell were you thinking?
*  All right, Senator.
*  The basic science behind that.
*  The leaders of meta-tick-tock, SNAP, Discord, and X testified that they have taken steps
*  to crack down on such material.
*  But when pressed, most of the executives refused to endorse federal regulation to address
*  the problem.
*  Are you familiar with the Earned Act?
*  Do you support that?
*  Like yes or no?
*  We're not prepared to support it today, but we believe that we support the CSAM Act.
*  We are not prepared to support it today.
*  We do support the shield there.
*  We believe that the cyber-tip line in next day that would be no.
*  Throughout the hearing, families in the audience held up photos of the victims of online child
*  sexual abuse and act that Republican Senator Lindsey Graham singled out for praise.
*  To all the victims who came and showed us photos of your loved ones, don't quit.
*  You're making a difference.
*  Through you, we'll get the where we need to go so other people won't have to show photo
*  of their family.
