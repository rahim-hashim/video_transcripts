# The Billionaires’ Secret Plan to Solve California’s Housing Crisis
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfaxqsrbkAA)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. This is The Daily.
*  For years, a mysterious company has been buying farmland on the outskirts of Silicon Valley,
*  eventually putting together a plot twice the size of San Francisco. But at every step,
*  those behind the company kept their plans for the land shrouded in secrecy,
*  until my colleague, Connor Doherty, figured out who they were and what they were up to.
*  It's Monday, March 11th.
*  So, Connor, this story begins as a real estate mystery that you took it upon yourself to try to
*  crack wide open. So tell us about where this mystery unfolds.
*  Okay, so if you imagine you're in San Francisco and you drive north, further up into the Bay Area,
*  into an area called Solano County, and then you go way east and you end up in this very rural corner
*  of the Bay Area that not a lot of people know about. And it's over here in this rural corner
*  of Solano County where our story takes place. And it's these open sort of rolling landscape
*  of yellow hills with almost nothing on it. The largest structures there are wind turbines.
*  And a lot of the families out there are farmers. They farm sheep, feed crops, and cows. And many
*  of the people out there have been there since like the 1860s. This is a place where families
*  stay in the same place for generations and pass the farms down several times. This is a place
*  where not a lot changes. But then in 2017, something very unusual starts to happen.
*  A company called Flannery Associates, which nobody in the area has ever heard of, starts buying land.
*  And they buy more the next year, the year after that, the year after that, more and more and more
*  and more, until pretty quickly, they're the biggest landowner in the entire county. So all these
*  neighbors are at supermarkets, they're at church, they're at schools. I mean, this is a place where
*  everyone knows everyone. They're all on community boards together. They all talk to each other all
*  the time. They all sort of simultaneously get these offers for their land. Right. And like you said,
*  they don't even know who the offer is coming from. All they know is that a very aggressive,
*  as we say in New York, highly motivated buyer is in their midst. Exactly. Highly motivated
*  buyer. So they not only want everyone's farm, they start offering people these incredibly
*  sweetheart deals, which say, okay, well, I'm going to buy your land, but you can stay there for the
*  next decade or two, depending on how old they are. And for all that time, you can collect all the
*  income from this land. I don't even want the income of the land. So one thing everyone realizes
*  pretty quickly is these people are not interested in farming. Because if they wanted to farm, they
*  would kick the farmers off the land they had just bought. Or they would want to make money from
*  farming. Right. Like they don't care about the price that reflects the income and they don't
*  even care about collecting the income. So they very obviously have a plan that has nothing to do
*  with farming. And so the question is, what's the plan? And who are these people? Right. So then the
*  county starts to get curious who this is. But because this Flannery Associates is incorporated
*  in Delaware, which has some specific rules that kind of cloak who is behind a company, nobody can
*  figure out who they are. And they send a bunch of letters to the company Flannery Associates lawyer.
*  And this lawyer kind of just puts them off and says, Oh, don't worry about it. This is a group
*  of wealthy families who are looking to diversify their assets and they just want to park it in
*  farmland. Basically, local mayors concerned citizens are going down to the libraries and
*  pulling property records and you know, looking up corporate LLCs and stuff to sort of try to figure
*  out who is behind this. The county becomes very concerned about what is happening here. There's
*  this massive information vacuum and people start to fill it. We're talking about Solano County,
*  where the single largest landowner is now an LLC based in Delaware. The group of Flannery Associates
*  has acquired tens of thousands of acres of dry farmland equivalent to nearly double the size of
*  San Francisco. And no one knows why. So whatever they are, I know what they aren't. They aren't
*  buying carbon credits. You know, they have intentions that are outside of our usual land
*  use ideas. That's what makes it scary, I guess, is that we don't we know nothing about them.
*  Now there's an important detail here that I've sort of left out, which is a mysterious purchase
*  of dry farmland near Travis Air Force Base, one of the most critical military bases in the western
*  U.S. has raised serious questions. All of this land is near and surrounds Travis Air Force Base,
*  which is a very important strategic Air Force Base, sometimes called the Gateway to the Pacific.
*  And the concern is that a foreign actor of some kind, spies basically, is buying up a bunch of
*  land around an Air Force Base. That it may very well be Chinese money. With a goal of surveilling
*  it or something like that. For a enemy to be able to be right next to the base to monitor,
*  to listen in to the communications, it would certainly be possible to do that if you own the
*  land adjacent to the fence line of Travis Air Force Base. There's never any evidence of all this,
*  but because of where the land is situated around this base, right, it's a somewhat reasonable
*  suspicion. Yes, so by 2023, members of Congress, all sorts of people are flipping out. The Defense
*  Department starts investigating this, the FBI starts investigating this, the State Department
*  starts investigating this. All of these agencies are investigating who is behind this company.
*  You know, just anything you can come up with, people have thrown the idea out. Except for what
*  it turns out to be. So I cover housing here, and this was a little off my beat, but I was very
*  interested. So I started looking into it a little bit and made a couple calls, but I didn't turn up
*  much. Then one day, pretty much out of the blue, I get a message. And I can't exactly say where or
*  how or from whom, but someone tells me, I know what this is. Tantalizing. This isn't some group
*  of rich families trying to park their cash in farmland, like the Flannery Associates lawyer
*  implied. This is at least, according to this tip, some of the most powerful people in technology,
*  venture capitalists, executives from Silicon Valley, buying this land, and they're trying to
*  round up other investors to join them. So now you have a theory about who is buying this land.
*  It's a bunch of really rich venture capital types from Silicon Valley, but at this point,
*  you don't really know if that's actually true. Totally. And as you know, you get a lot of tips
*  as a reporter. Some of them sound quite extraordinary and turn out to be nothing. But
*  for various reasons that I can't get into, I sort of knew this had to be worth checking out.
*  So I call basically, you know, everyone I've ever met. I mean, I'm kidding, but I start just
*  blitzing the phones, right? I am sitting there texting, calling, just trying to find anybody
*  who might know anything about this in this kind of nexus. I think the technical term is dog with a
*  bone. Yes. So then I started working with my colleague, Aaron Griffith, who covers venture
*  capital. And eventually, through a ton of reporting, we were able to confirm that yes, in fact,
*  the money behind Flannery Associates was a who's who of Silicon Valley.
*  Lorene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, Mark Andreessen,
*  very famous venture capitalist from Andreessen Horowitz, Michael Moritz, billionaire venture
*  capitalist from a company called Sequoia Capital, Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn.
*  Some of the richest people on earth are actually the ones buying all this farmland. And the craziest
*  thing is what I learned their plan was to take all this land, an area about twice the size of San
*  Francisco, on this farmland, building totally from scratch, a brand new city that they hoped would
*  help solve California's housing crisis. And beyond that, create an entirely new
*  model for building communities in this country.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So what do you end up learning Connor about the specific plan that all these rich folks have for
*  this model city that they want to build on this farmland? So this whole thing I learned is the
*  plan of a guy named Jan Sremmick. Who's that? Jan Sremmick is an interesting guy. He's originally
*  from the Czech Republic. And in his telling, he grew up in this tiny town of 1000 people.
*  But he's this very precocious entrepreneurial young guy. According to him, he brought internet
*  to his town and actually cut a side deal for himself to get money for this is always looking
*  for an angle. And with the help of different scholarships, he studied at Cambridge, goes to
*  the London School of Economics, and becomes a star trader at Goldman Sachs. He leaves Goldman
*  Sachs and eventually makes his way to California where he does several startups that have a pretty
*  mixed record of success. And one thing to know about Jan is that he's really enamored with the
*  culture of Silicon Valley. He loves the startup thing. He loves the feeling of the way people in
*  Silicon Valley try to blend this kind of philanthropic message with capitalism that we're
*  saving the world and we're going to make a bundle doing it like this whole sort of spirit of Silicon
*  Valley. All of this appeals to him. But there's one thing he really doesn't like, especially being a
*  European. He hates the place. He likes the culture, but he hates the physical hates the physical
*  place. Now, if you've ever spent time in Silicon Valley, it's really not a very remarkable place.
*  It's very sprawled out. You go to like Sand Hill Road, which is where all the biggest venture
*  capitalists are. And it's like this like kind of crappy office complex. There are of course,
*  some very beautiful wealthy neighborhoods, but a lot of the housing stock is these kind of
*  cul-de-sac-y, whatever you would sort of stereotype as the kind of American suburb,
*  it just feels like that. So not only is he sort of uninspired by this very low density landscape,
*  there's a huge housing crisis in California at this time. And not only is a huge housing crisis,
*  there's just a ton of conflict over whether or not the state should build more, you know,
*  how it should build. It's just a big fight over basically whether to even solve it.
*  So he is coming to this all very fresh. And the idea that there's this place where people
*  start big companies and investors give young guys millions of dollars to chase their crazy idea. I
*  mean, this just seems like paradise to him and allowing more people to move here, you know,
*  building tons more housing, building great buildings. That's what he thinks should be
*  happening. So his argument basically is that a place as magnetic and energetic and influential
*  as the Bay Area, as Silicon Valley deserves a physical community worthy of all those qualities
*  that does not exist. In fact, it's the opposite. Yes, 100%. Now that feeling that Jan's expressing
*  that Silicon Valley in San Francisco can do better, that it's become too hard to build in
*  California, that this vibrant place has gotten stuck. That feeling is shared by a lot of very
*  rich and powerful people, in particular in the venture capital and tech community. There is this
*  very deep frustration in that world that is much influence as they've had on the digital world.
*  They've had very little influence on the physical world. I mean, these are people who grew up
*  dreaming of flying cars and, you know, monorails through Sim City landscapes, that sort of thing.
*  And yet they live in this strip mall office complex cul-de-sac suburb. And because of the
*  politics of the state, it's almost impossible for them to change that. People talk constantly about
*  this. And Jan, at this point, is extremely well connected. He is friends with billionaires. He's
*  in a book club with some pretty high-powered venture capitalists. So he puts together a
*  plan for a new community in eastern Solano County, one that lives up to his vision and
*  one that he brings to these people. And eventually he's got almost a billion dollars to pursue this
*  idea of building an entirely new city from scratch out in this rural area. So Connor,
*  what happens once you and The Times break the story and tell the world what's really
*  going on? Because it's been so secretive and mysterious until that point. So within an hour
*  or two of us breaking the story, Jan's LinkedIn page re-identifies him as CEO of California
*  Forever. California Forever. Philantery Associates is dead and California Forever has taken its place.
*  It's a whole new company with a whole new name and a very friendly face. And not only that,
*  it's as public as you can be. It goes from black box that nobody can get in to a company that has
*  opened four offices around Solano County so that you can walk in and go, hey, how are you doing?
*  What's this project? And learn about it and see maps and talk to people about it. Wow. A company
*  that has put billboards all over the 80 freeway on the way up to Sacramento saying California
*  Forever. So they've gone from nothing to you can't stop hearing about them. Well, what exactly are
*  they saying once they decide to acknowledge what they are, rebrand themselves and start having what
*  sounds like the beginning of a conversation with the people in this county? So because of county law,
*  they cannot build this city unless they get a vote of the people. Ah, right. California is among
*  other things land of the ballot initiative. Exactly. Solano County has a rule that says
*  you can't build in the rural areas and that's because they want to preserve these farms
*  just as they've been for generations. So at the start of this year, California Forever filed a
*  proposed ballot initiative that would undo that and pave the way for them to eventually build this
*  city. And the hope is that this initiative would go before Solano County voters in November.
*  Good evening. Good evening, everyone. Thank you for being here. How's everyone doing tonight?
*  So they have to go on this massive charm offensive because not only do they have to eventually
*  convince elected officials and all these people to give them permission to build.
*  Thank you for coming out and learning about this California Forever project. You've been
*  hearing a lot about it in the media and we're here to get your questions answered. We know
*  everybody's got a lot of questions. They have to get the whole county to vote affirmatively for
*  this project. So, Jan, take it away. So Jan goes from nobody has heard of Jan to he's everywhere
*  in the county. He's meeting with elected officials. He's meeting with union leaders. Good evening,
*  everyone. Thank you for coming to introduce myself. You might be asking yourself, why is
*  this guy with a funny accent here? And then he starts having a series of public town hall meetings
*  in all these different cities across Solano County. This acceleration in home prices and pushing of
*  particularly working class families out of California has been building up since the 80s.
*  And he just begins pitching people. Every five years, it gets worse and it gets worse and it
*  gets worse and it gets worse. And the pitch really begins with all the huge problems California is
*  facing right now. And so where our project times in together with this is that we do think that
*  we need to revisit some of these ideas and we need to look into if our kids are going to be able to
*  live in California, if California is going to be a state that does something about homelessness.
*  And he really says, I have an answer to what is ailing us. We need to build again. We need to think
*  big again, that this is what California needs to essentially shock itself out of its current malaise.
*  New community, homes in safe walkable neighborhoods, good paying local jobs,
*  locally owned shops and businesses, big employers make it big enough to be an economic engine for
*  everyone. Make it big. And he says, we're going to build row houses with bike lanes and a dense city
*  with a bus running around the perimeter of it where you can walk to shops. Basically,
*  it describes Brooklyn for where you live or where you're sitting. And we went out and we found a
*  group of investors who wanted to double down on California and who believe that if you could
*  purchase enough property, that you could design a project that was designed in a way that it made
*  everyone around better. And eventually this city, they hope, will have 400,000 people living there.
*  A from scratch, fully envisioned, densely constructed community where you go to work,
*  you go to the theater, you do your grocery shopping, all within walking distance of your
*  row house, which is attached to another house, which is exactly the kind of dense
*  style of living that urban planners say we should be having in this country.
*  More of it, not less of it. Exactly.
*  Connor, all of this sounds eminently reasonable that I wonder why Jan approached it from the
*  beginning with so much secrecy and mystery because that doesn't feel in keeping with the spirit
*  of what he is talking about here. Yes. Well, pretty simple answer there. Money.
*  What Jan will tell you is that they were worried that people would jack up the prices of the land.
*  If they were public. Yes. That if people out there realized that the richest people in the world
*  had a plan to buy all this land, they would start raising the prices. Got it. But at the same time,
*  it created a ton of suspicion in this community. And on top of that, it's possible some of these
*  farmers might not have sold if they would have known what the plans were. You know, many of these
*  people have a very deep connection to the idea of this as an agricultural place. Well, to that
*  point, what happens once the public and all the farmers who have sold their land learn precisely
*  what the plan is and what they have sold their land off to become? So people are incredibly
*  unhappy about it. So I go to the town hall and right off the bat, my question is, where are you
*  making your money? Because it comes across like you're doing a big favor for all of us to build
*  this. But I know you're looking for a bottom line. So I'm people contend that this is just a plan to
*  get rich. If you get your way, you will get to build this giant city and the land you bought for
*  not very much money will suddenly be worth an astronomical amount more. And these people who
*  are already billionaires are just going to get richer. I am one of the 43 individuals that has
*  been named in the lawsuit because I own 200 acres of land. As they acquired the land, they also use
*  some pretty significant strong arm tactics such as suing farmers, many of whom were in a lawsuit
*  with them during the town hall. Will you commit to dropping the lawsuit against the local farmers
*  who are not aligned with your vision in a goodwill attempt to change the way that you are interacting
*  with our community, which is right now unacceptable? At one point, this family rose up and one after
*  the other started saying you're suing my family. Flannery slash California forever's divisiveness
*  and deception are very well documented. Then there's the more obvious thing people say, which is,
*  how do you expect anyone in this room or the county to believe what you're saying? How do you
*  express this to trust you after you've been basically lying to us for seven years? I would
*  like you to explain further why you look at farmers whose land is more important to them
*  than your money, why we are a problem.
*  This is a rural area and does not want to be a city. They have remained here because they like
*  being farmers and they like being in a small town where everyone knows each other. And that is the
*  way of life to which they are accustomed. And many of these people will tell you, I know California
*  has a housing problem. They are aware that there are big cities not too far from them and that they
*  have significant troubles. But what they're saying is this is farmland. If you want to sort of solve
*  San Francisco housing problems, like maybe you start in San Francisco. Right. No one there seemed
*  particularly happy about it. Right. Which does not seem like a great sign. If, as you said earlier,
*  Connor, what California forever needs most is to hear from this community that it's willing to vote
*  to let this city get built. Yes. People are very skeptical of them. And I've even heard people who
*  are, you know, sort of more kind of seasoned political people saying it's very hard to trust
*  them right now. And if I'm going to give them all this affirmation in the form of a vote, I need to
*  be pretty confident that they're going to do what they say they're going to do. I mean, there's a
*  real irony here, which is that California forever thought that the best way to circumvent
*  all of the normal screaming and yelling and community opposition and bureaucracy and NIMBYism
*  of big city California was to escape to rural California and try to build a brand new model of
*  housing and urban living there. And they ended up unleashing a different, but it sounds like no less
*  fierce aversion of all those same forces just a couple hours outside the city. Exactly. And I think
*  they probably knew that would happen. And I think in a weird way, this is what they want. What do you
*  mean? But why do they what do you mean they want it? I think in their mind, it's almost easier to
*  build a city than it is to build a duplex. I think they would rather have one big gigantic knockdown
*  drag out expensive fight. And then if they get approval, just build the city. You know, if you
*  think about it, the problem in San Francisco is that they fight over every little duplex, they fight
*  over every little apartment building. And I think they're sort of like, okay, let's do this once.
*  Let's have it be as furious and expensive as it can be. And if we get over that hump,
*  then we can build a city that they hope one day will have 400,000 people in it.
*  Hmm. And I think they've calculated if we do this on this scale, it'll be too big to fail.
*  This is fascinating. This project is almost ideological for Jan. He knows that there's
*  a huge distrust of Silicon Valley and billionaires, and that many see his approach as hubris.
*  He's totally aware of all of this. But this is a state that built the Golden Gate Bridge and
*  went from a little frontier town to the largest state and the fifth largest economy
*  in the entire world. And I think there's a feeling that it's forgotten how to do those big things.
*  And I think what Jan would tell you, his argument is somebody needs to revive this spirit.
*  Somehow we need to get Californians excited about big things again. And if it's not this,
*  then what is it? And if it's not them, then who?
*  Well, Connor, thank you very much. We appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. The Justice Department has begun a criminal
*  investigation into the midair blowout of a panel on an Alaska Airlines flight
*  that forced the plane to make an emergency landing in January. Federal investigators
*  have suggested that Boeing may have delivered the plane to Alaska Airlines without installing the
*  bolts necessary to hold the panel in place. And in an interview over the weekend with MSNBC,
*  President Biden delivered some of his harshest words to date about Israel's deadly military
*  strategy in Gaza and about the man leading it, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*  He's hurting, in my view, he's hurting Israel more than helping Israel by making the rest of
*  the world. It's contrary to what Israel stands for. And I think it's a big mistake. So I want
*  to see a ceasefire. In the interview, Biden was asked if there was a point at which Netanyahu's
*  actions would compel the U.S. to cut off military aid to Israel. There's red lines that if he crosses
*  and he cannot have 30,000 more Palestinians dead. Today's episode was produced by the
