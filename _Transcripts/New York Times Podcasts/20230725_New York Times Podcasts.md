*  From the New York Times, I'm Matina Steves-Gradinif, in for Sabrina, and this is the Daily.
*  Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the global food supply at risk, until the two countries
*  struck an unusual deal to keep food shipments flowing.
*  Last week, that deal fell apart.
*  Today, my colleague, Mark Centura, on what the collapse of the deal means for the war,
*  and why its impact will be felt by tens of millions of people across the world.
*  It's Tuesday, July 25th.
*  Mark, tell me about this deal that fell apart last week, and why it's so significant.
*  Very simply, Matina, it's about feeding the world.
*  Between the two of them, Russia and Ukraine provide just a ton of the world's food supply.
*  Russia and Ukraine produce about 30 percent of the world's wheat and barley.
*  20 percent of corn comes from Russia in the Ukraine.
*  80 percent of sunflower oil, palm oil, which is usually...
*  Ukraine is one of the world's leading suppliers of grain, barley, rapeseed oil,
*  sunflower seeds, and a host of other products.
*  Russia's invasion of Ukraine has upended the flow of food around the world.
*  But the moment Russia launched its full-scale invasion, it also instituted a naval blockade
*  on all of Ukraine's black sea ports.
*  They laid sea mines, trapping the ships that were meant to deliver millions of tons of grain
*  to the global market.
*  Around 25 million tons of grain are stuck in the country.
*  Some of it is stored in silos like these in the port of Odessa waiting for export.
*  So all of that just went off the market overnight.
*  The food supply for millions of Ukrainians and millions more around the world
*  has quite literally been held hostage by the Russian military.
*  But for Russia's part, they're the global leader in exporting fertilizer around the world.
*  The war starts and the exporting of that fertilizer becomes incredibly more difficult for Russia
*  because of the sanctions that are put on them.
*  So you have a situation where crops are stuck in Ukraine and the stuff that helps those crops grow
*  is harder to move out of Russia and food prices soar.
*  So when it became clear that this war was not going to be a quick war, but a lasting war,
*  international pressure began to build to try and find some sort of solution.
*  Right.
*  And that solution is an agreement to restart food shipments.
*  So how does that come together?
*  So in April of last year, Ukraine and Russia agreed to begin to talk about this growing problem.
*  They won't do it with each other, but they agreed to start discussing ways to possibly find a
*  solution and they do that in Turkey.
*  And Turkey's central role in all this makes sense just even if you look at the map,
*  Turkey controls the only way in and out of the Black Sea where all these ships from Ukraine would
*  have to go through, right?
*  That's right, Matina.
*  They are the ones who determine what ships can pass through civilian cargo vessels and others.
*  And so in order for any ship to get safe passage, the first step is for Turkey to grant
*  passage into the Black Sea.
*  And here you have the situation where the Turkish leader has an Erdogan who has relationships
*  both with Moscow and with Ukraine, with the West and with the East, tries to position himself as
*  sort of the mediator here, the person who can find a solution to one of the deepest and most
*  complex global problems that arose from Russia's invasion over Ukraine.
*  Well, I remember covering these talks in this gamble and just felt like a bit of a mission
*  impossible to get Russia to back off and agree to anything.
*  But I remember thinking maybe Erdogan, maybe the Turkish president would be able to pull it off.
*  Yeah, amazingly he does.
*  And I think when the parties were actually finally brought together to sign this agreement,
*  the depth of the division and the challenges in making it happen were evident in the signing ceremony
*  itself.
*  Today there is a beacon on the Black Sea, a beacon of hope, a beacon of possibility,
*  a beacon of relief.
*  They had a grand table laid out with flowers and all the usual state craft that goes into
*  the signing of a treaty where you'd have two parties come together and sign a document.
*  In this case, the Russians came out first onto the stage, signed it, and then left.
*  Ukraine, Adina, Altya, Pubakana, Olexander, Kubrako, the Ukrainians separately came out and they
*  signed and they left. Never at any point did Russia and Ukraine make a deal together.
*  Rather, what they had was a deal through Turkey and the United Nations to get the grain moving
*  again. The signature ceremony has done it. Thank you.
*  I remember watching that moment and it was just so fragile, so delicate and you could really see
*  that in the careful choreography of making sure that the two officials would never actually be on
*  stage at the same time.
*  Again, you have to remember the emotions too here. I mean, the atrocities in Butcher had come
*  to light. You had Russia raining missiles down on towns and cities across the country occupying
*  something like 25% of the land. It's incredible that they were able to find some way forward on this.
*  So let's walk through exactly what was in that deal. What did each side agree to?
*  So, Matina, the deal basically has two parts. First, you have the UN promising that it's
*  going to help Russia get better and cheaper terms to let it export its own fertilizer.
*  Essentially, it's the UN saying that it's going to help ease sanctions put on Moscow for launching
*  its invasion of Ukraine. In exchange, Russia says it'll grant safe passage for cargo ships
*  through the Black Sea helping them navigate a maze of maritime mines and also pests its own
*  warships to bring the grain out of Ukraine. And then, to be sure the ships aren't smuggling goods
*  or ammunition or other things, there will be an inspection center set up an Istanbul with
*  people from both Ukraine and Russia who can inspect the ships as they leave.
*  So Russian officials and Ukrainian officials are going to be working together in this small space
*  in Istanbul to get the grain ships moving again. Yeah, I mean, even though the deal itself isn't
*  between Russia and Ukraine, you have a situation where you have the two parties basically operating
*  in this little joint center to try and get this grain onto the market again. And the place we're
*  going to see if this deal is going to work. And the most important place for it to succeed is in
*  the Southern Ukrainian port city of Odessa. And why is Odessa so important? So Odessa has economic,
*  militaryly strategic and symbolic importance. First of all, it's the largest port in Ukraine and
*  it's sort of a remarkable site to see. Cranes rising high in the sky, dozens and dozens of
*  and train lines leading into this sprawling shipyard in port. There are warehouses, there's fuel
*  depots. Basically, it's not only a vital part of the economy in Odessa, but for Ukraine more broadly.
*  So when Putin announced his invasion, there was a feeling that the Kremlin thought it could take
*  without having to destroy Odessa. And the first weeks of the war, I remember one of the few places
*  that was somewhat unscathed by Russian missiles and bombs was Odessa. The first bombing wasn't
*  recorded until I think it was three or four weeks into the war itself. And that was just on the
*  outskirts of Odessa. But the city still suffered. With the naval blockade, the port was completely
*  shut down. The economic engine of the city stops running. Russian warships menace off the coast.
*  There's a threat of an amphibious invasion. People go to the beach not for leisure, but the pack
*  sand and the sandbags. And so a city known for its celebration of life and its sense of humor and
*  its rockiness and its joy to leave is gone silent to a large degree.
*  So set against that tense backdrop, the first ship is loaded with grain in a port in Odessa.
*  And on August 1st of last year, it sets out to sea.
*  It's really the sort of dramatic scene all across the city as the captain pulls out. He gives
*  the traditional three blasts of the horn. And people across the city, they stop and people
*  have tears in their eyes. It's like, okay, maybe the port might start to come back to life.
*  And so does life come back to Odessa and the port? Well, obviously it's nothing like it is before
*  the war. But ships are coming into Odessa again. They are being loaded with grain. They are making
*  their way out to the global market. Workers are filling those ships and captains were selling them
*  out to sea. Every few months, the deal basically had to be renewed. And so there would be these
*  periods where the amount of ships allowed it would slow. And there would be questions of if it
*  would be renewed and tensions around it. But really, for the most part, it held. And over the course
*  of the entire initiative, something like 33 million tons of grain was able to make its way from
*  the black sea to the global market. So for a while there, it looks like this global
*  food crisis, this meltdown has kind of been averted, right? Yeah, remarkably the deal holds.
*  There are problems and hiccups, but grain is moving
*  Until it isn't. And the deal falls apart.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Mark, what happens? Why does the deal fall apart so suddenly?
*  The agreement, which assures Ukrainian grain could be transported through the black sea,
*  is due to expire on July 17th. The groundbreaking deal has been renewed three times since its
*  first signing, but it may not be renewed again. Well, I think we start to see the tension building
*  as the renewal date started to approach. One of the last two ships carrying grain through the
*  black sea corridor anchored at Istanbul Saturday. By the end of June, the last ship approved by Russia
*  to be part of this deal came into the port San Odessa. Russian President Vladimir Putin is
*  threatening to walk away from the black sea grain deal unless some sanctions are lifted.
*  And then as the date of the renewal drew closer, we saw Putin get more fiery and his rhetoric and
*  start to make more demands and say essentially enough is enough.
*  And then, last week, Monday, Moscow says it won't extend the agreement. The Kremlin says they're done.
*  That night, bombs start falling on the port of Odessa.
*  The next day, you have the Kremlin say that any ship that is seen selling towards Ukraine
*  will be considered hostile and could be blown out of the water.
*  A second night of what Ukraine describes as hellish aerial assault by Russia on the city of Odessa.
*  And then the next night, Odessa is bombed again. And the next night,
*  these were targeted attacks and exactly the place where grain exports are to take place.
*  So, and this has now become probably the most intense bombardment sustained by Odessa throughout
*  the course of the 16 month war. I was there for a few nights of it and the attack would come in waves.
*  It would be attack drones. It would be missiles fired on a ballistic trajectory to give
*  this incredible speed. Russia was also firing anti-ship missiles and these missiles, they skim
*  along the surface of the sea making them remarkably hard to shoot down. And Odessa spared
*  early in the war, now finds itself squarely in Moscow's crosshairs.
*  What a devastating remarkable 180 and basically less than a week from deal to no deal, from
*  relative peace to all-out bombardment. Why do we think Russia is doing this?
*  Well, there is first the Kremlin stated reason, which is they say they're not getting what they
*  want out of this deal. The sanctions are not being eased in a way that they find sufficient for
*  their participation. Of course, they add stuff to what they say they want and the Ukrainian
*  sea, that's just nothing but pure blackmail. But second, whatever the Kremlin says, it's also
*  important to keep in mind just what a different place we're in now than when this deal was first
*  negotiated and agreed to back in August of last summer. Russia is in a much weakened state and
*  so quite frankly is President Putin who just faced an uprising within his own ranks of his military.
*  And so in this weakened position, one of the levers that Moscow still has at its disposal is
*  the economic pressure it's putting on the country because the export of agricultural goods in
*  grain is an essential part of the Ukrainian economy. The shutting off of that has a real impact.
*  And then thirdly, globally, Russia is showing that it can still wreak havoc on a very important
*  global market. In this case, the food market. And again, the Ukrainians say it's Russia using
*  food as a weapon trying to hold the world hostage to its demands saying we will not allow this
*  food to go out unless you give us what we want. The US Europeans agree with that assessment
*  that what Russia is doing here is just essentially blackmail.
*  So essentially, this would be a way to sort of stick it to the international community for the Russians.
*  Yeah, absolutely. And perhaps their hope is that they could then, by pressuring the international
*  community, hope the international community then puts pressure on Ukraine to look for some sort
*  of negotiated settlement, which quite frankly does not seem to be on the table at the moment in
*  any fashion. So given all that, where do we stand a week since the deal collapsed?
*  So again, remember, the Kremlin said it will deem any ship trying to travel to Ukraine to export
*  grain hostile, meaning they reserved the right to shoot it out of the water. And then the Ukrainian
*  said they will view any ship moving out of either Russian occupied ports in southern Ukraine
*  or Russian ports in the Black Sea itself as potentially hostile, setting up this incredibly tense
*  environment on the Black Sea itself. And so you have surging grain prices and you have 29 ships
*  that are basically just waiting now out at sea, hoping maybe that they could get to a port in
*  Ukraine and load up with grain. Mark, is there any credible way out of this?
*  Well, Matina, short of Russia rejoining the initiative, which
*  giving the events of the past week, Moscow has given no indication they intend to do.
*  The options are pretty risky. But the Ukrainians say they would like to see happen is for the
*  world to basically call Moscow's bluff for ships to sail along the corridor, load up with grain,
*  take that grain back out into the global market and basically dare Russia to shoot an
*  internationally flagged civilian ship. But even last week, the US intelligence community was warning
*  that Moscow and its navy were already mining this route in a way that they could then maybe train
*  blame Ukraine should one of these ships blow up. So it's fraught with risk. And this plan to have
*  any chance of actually becoming a reality, even the Ukrainians say they need something essential,
*  which is Turkey to signal that they will protect these ships moving through this corridor.
*  And Turkey taking that step would be a real break with Russia, right?
*  Yeah, I mean, no matter how personally upset Erdogan might be with Putin for pulling out,
*  to take such a step would basically side with Ukraine. And he has very carefully positioned himself
*  throughout the war as the broker between the two nations rather than taking one side explicitly.
*  And even if Turkey were to give this signal, you still have other added complications, particularly
*  private shipping companies and insurers who might be low to send a ship through mine-infested waters
*  with the threat of Russian warships shooting at them. Yeah, that all sounds wildly unlikely to work.
*  Yeah, but again, I think we've seen over the course of the 16 months of this war that
*  the future is also fraught. So I think at the moment everyone's just watching and waiting to see
*  what happens next. And of course, the longer we wait for this situation to play out,
*  the closer we get to another food crisis because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
*  Absolutely. I mean, there's already a million tons of grain waiting in Port Snow Desa at the moment
*  and the more grain that piles up there, the less food there is on plates on people's tables across the world.
*  Mark, thank you. Thank you, Matina.
*  On Monday, Russia expanded its assault on Ukraine's grain exports, using drones to attack
*  a port along the Danube River, about 70 miles from the Black Sea. The strikes signal that Russia
*  is now seeking to destroy every available way for Ukraine to ship its grain to the rest of the world.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. In Israel on Monday, the far-right government of Benjamin
*  Netanyahu followed through with its plan to limit the power of the country's Supreme Court,
*  despite protests from tens of thousands of Israelis and the explicit opposition of the Biden
*  administration. The plan adopted during a dramatic vote by Israel's parliament would prevent the
*  court from overturning many decisions made by Netanyahu and his ministers, shielding his government
*  from traditional judicial oversight. The battle over the judiciary has become one of the biggest
*  political showdowns in modern Israeli history, pitting secular Israelis who opposed the plan
*  against religious nationalists who supported it. Dozens of major businesses shot down on Monday.
*  Israel's largest labor union said it may call for a national strike, and more than 10,000
*  military reservists are threatening to resign from duty.
*  On Monday night, Netanyahu seemed to acknowledge the protesters during a televised speech,
*  offering to postpone the plan for even bigger changes to the country's court system.
