*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Barrow.
*  This is Adali.
*  Today.
*  And we are counting down to chaos.
*  Title 42 will officially expire in less than 18 hours.
*  The pandemic air policy allowed the US government to quickly expel migrants to cross into
*  the US illegally.
*  After Thursday, it's going to be a free for all the Biden administration.
*  For weeks, officials have feared that the end of Title 42 would create a crisis at the
*  US-Mexico border that would strain and possibly cripple America's immigration system.
*  Title 42 goes away on Thursday and migrants will be in crisis as soon as next week.
*  It will be a humanitarian crisis because we are not prepared.
*  My colleague, Natalie Kichoev, has been at the border and describes what actually happened
*  when the milestone policy came to an end.
*  It's Tuesday, May 16th.
*  Okay, can you hear me?
*  I can hear you.
*  Okay, great.
*  We're just pulling off to this part of the border that I'm trying to get to.
*  I'm sorry.
*  It's super dusty.
*  So, Natalie, just by way of context, it's Thursday, May 11th.
*  You're right at the US-Mexico border.
*  It's the middle of the day.
*  Can you just describe exactly where you are geographically and what you're seeing?
*  First of all, I'm seeing the group of migrants, maybe three or four hundred people that have
*  gathered on the other side of the Rio Grande.
*  Crossing the Rio Grande, which by the way is not that grand at this particular part of
*  Siudas Fortas, it's like a shallow and very crossable stream-like body of water almost.
*  And they just have walked across the other side.
*  Can there's this barbed wire?
*  They've been going through the barbed wire and now they are between the barbed wire and
*  this massive border wall.
*  That's what you might imagine.
*  It looks like a big, very tall fence.
*  But they're on US oil and so they want to turn themselves in to border officials, some
*  of them to apply for asylum.
*  Now, what does it mean for the people on the other side of this river who are successfully
*  crossing to some degree to do that today?
*  Yeah.
*  We're hours away from this border restriction being lifted.
*  And what that means for folks is that the migration landscape in the United States is about
*  to radically change.
*  They're going to be the first people we think, depending on when border agents start
*  processing them to really test out what is this new system.
*  You know, before, under the measure, which is called Title 42, the US government could
*  summarily expel people when they crossed illegally.
*  That's no longer an option anymore starting later tonight.
*  Now folks who are on US soil are going to have to be processed.
*  It's going to take longer whether or not they're actually going to get legal status.
*  We don't know.
*  It's going to be difficult.
*  The Biden administration has put in new rules and the people that I'm looking at right
*  now are the ones who are really, we think, again, it depends on when they get across or
*  what's really going to happen.
*  But these are going to be the first people to kind of test it out.
*  And if the policy right in this moment before mid-night is to summarily expel migrants
*  who come to the border, why is this group crossing now?
*  Honestly, it's impossible to know exactly why any group of migrants is crossing right
*  now.
*  We don't have any really clear sense and there's just a lot of mixed messaging.
*  So it's difficult to parse, you know, the individual rationale of each person.
*  But what we know is that over the last several days we have seen a rush to the border and
*  we are still seeing people crossing today and it remains to be seen what's going to happen
*  over the next few days.
*  Right.
*  But as we've said on the show for weeks, there have been reports of a surge of people coming
*  to the border in anticipation of this change.
*  Do you have any sense of how many people are at or just inside of the border right now?
*  So we've been hearing that there's going to be this massive surge today on the day that
*  this pandemic ruled lifts.
*  But the reality is the numbers show that the surge is already here.
*  The number of encounters that the border has gone up to 11,000 a day.
*  That's up from 6,000 a day just a few weeks ago.
*  So that's a huge increase.
*  I mean, in effect, this thing that we were all racing for, it's already upon us.
*  It's been happening.
*  This is the reality at the border right now.
*  Now you have been where you are for the past week.
*  So describe what you have been seeing as all these migrants have arrived at the border.
*  Well, you're seeing people coming in on buses.
*  You're seeing them coming in on planes.
*  And one of the most dangerous ways that they're getting here is on this train that's known
*  as the beast.
*  It's also known as the train of death.
*  Because it's a really dangerous method for people to be traveling.
*  It's this massive cargo train that people risk their lives just getting on.
*  But I wanted to see what it was like to ride it into Fwates, to try to migrate on the
*  train.
*  So I boarded it south of the city.
*  We're sitting here among construction material.
*  Looks like steel, rebar.
*  And I got into a car that was full of steel, rebar, and about 40 migrants who had been
*  traveling some of them for four days.
*  The guys that I'm talking to said they've seen people killed when they've gotten off
*  it and the train has run over them.
*  There's not much water.
*  There's barely any food.
*  They're hungry.
*  They're scared.
*  It gets so cold at night.
*  And during the day, it's unbearably hot.
*  And they're surrounded by metal.
*  So during the day, touching that scalding hot surface can be dangerous.
*  And at night, sleeping on it is really uncomfortable.
*  And one of the people I talked to was this 33-year-old named Jonathan Aurevalos from Venezuela.
*  Jonathan said that the day there's been with us since we left.
*  He has crossed the Darian gap.
*  This treacherous jungle that was once considered impassable, but is now basically a highway
*  for migrants to get here.
*  He spent days doing that.
*  His friends told me that they had to basically eat sugar for a couple of days because that's
*  the only food that they had left.
*  Jonathan saying his choices were basically to stay in Venezuela and risk his life or leave
*  in risk his life.
*  He didn't think he was going to survive Venezuela, so he decided to give it a shot.
*  He's crossing the United States several times already and been returned under Title
*  42.
*  He was expelled at a different part of the border from where he entered and then bused to
*  the south of the country.
*  So that's why he had to take a train all the way up north to try again.
*  And he wanted to try one more time because he actually thinks it's going to get a lot
*  harder when the measure lifts.
*  So Jonathan just heard basically that when the measure lifts, you really could just be
*  deported.
*  I think there's a couple of mixed messages happening here.
*  So he had been on this train trying to make it one last time for several days and he
*  basically said, I'm going to walk to the border if I can.
*  And right now we're rolling through Quattas were coming from the south up until the north.
*  But when you're on the train, as soon as they catch a glimpse of the Quattas city limits,
*  you know, a cheer will go up.
*  People are also still really hopeful.
*  And when they start to arrive to this city, you can feel the kind of spirit lift and people
*  are looking at each other and they're saying, you know, we finally made it.
*  Of course, for many of them, this is, they hope the last leg of a very long journey.
*  I think they know and we know that there's no guarantee that this is really the end of it.
*  And the questions that the administration is asking itself and that we're all waiting
*  to see is how long that takes, how much chaos and folds and whether the system gets overloaded.
*  Well, Natalie, thank you for now and we will check back in with you once Title 42 is lifted
*  and everything is different.
*  Sounds good.
*  Thanks, Michael.
*  We'll break back.
*  So, Natalie, when we talked to you on Thursday during that afternoon, things were looking to be
*  at kind of a fever pitch.
*  There was this sudden wave of migrants at the border.
*  The shelters on the US side were full.
*  Everyone had this question in their mind, is this going to basically break the United
*  States system for processing migrants?
*  So what ended up happening once Title 42 was actually lifted?
*  Well, it didn't break the system and it turned out that what we'd been seeing over
*  the last few days, that was kind of the peak.
*  And so when the clock struck midnight, Eastern time, I was sitting there watching the border.
*  I was looking at the Rio Grande and looking at this group of migrants waiting to try to
*  get in.
*  It wasn't getting any bigger.
*  We weren't seeing a big rush to the border.
*  You know, for the whole week, we had kind of seen people walking with their kids and their
*  belongings toward the border.
*  We didn't see any of that that night.
*  I mean, it was really calm from where I was standing.
*  There was a lot of news media.
*  There were a lot of cameras pointed at the border wall.
*  But what they were capturing was a pretty tranquil scene.
*  How do you explain that?
*  That'll be the worst case scenario for the US didn't quite material.
*  As it sounds like perhaps the president's message about the end of Title 42 don't come.
*  The border is an open, perhaps, sunk in.
*  Well, yeah, I think a lot of people on both sides of the border think that Biden and his
*  administration were very clear that the new rules being put in place were not going to
*  mean open doors of the border.
*  And there's some sense that that message filtered down into the migrant WhatsApp groups,
*  the Facebook groups, the chats that are constantly spreading that information.
*  And I was talking to migrants in Huatas who were telling me that they had heard this message
*  from the Biden administration.
*  Right.
*  Because so much of the information that these migrants were receiving and spreading seemed
*  to be that this wasn't a good time to come because of these new rules that you just
*  referenced.
*  And Natalie, we talked about these rules last week with our colleague, Miriam Jordan,
*  but just briefly remind us why these new rules would have this cumulative effect of making
*  people pause, wait, not rush to the border.
*  So remember that under Title 42, there was a benefit for migrants.
*  There was a built-in incentive to cross the border illegally because if you crossed the
*  border illegally and got caught, you would probably be expelled immediately from the country,
*  but there was no black mark on your record.
*  As soon as Title 42 lifts, that's over.
*  If you are caught crossing illegally, migrants know that you could be subject to criminal
*  proceedings.
*  And most importantly, there's a five-year ban on re-entering the United States.
*  And so the migrants that I talked to are terrified of this.
*  This is the last thing that they want.
*  And it's really on their minds, this notion that they wouldn't be able to try to come
*  back in if this didn't work.
*  The other issue that they're talking about is this new set of rules that makes it really
*  hard to qualify for asylum, which is this legal status that gives you protection from persecution
*  in your home country.
*  If migrants tried to claim asylum under these new restrictions Biden put in place, you
*  have to prove that you requested and were rejected for asylum in Mexico or another country
*  that you passed through on the way to the United States.
*  There were some exceptions baked into these new rules, but all of the migrants that I talked
*  to felt that these new rules made it essentially impossible for many of them to qualify for this
*  kind of protected status.
*  So the overwhelming sense or the fear really was that the new system being put in place
*  was bad.
*  Right.
*  Which is exactly what the president and those around him hoped would be the message
*  that reached these migrants.
*  And as you have just explained that, it seemed it did reach them.
*  And it resulted in the averding of a momentary surge, perhaps even a crisis at the border
*  over the past few days when this three year old emergency rule came to an end.
*  Yeah.
*  It does seem that that may have happened, at least in the short term.
*  But honestly, the border is an extremely dynamic place and people are making decisions based
*  on information that changes daily.
*  And you know, the slightest sign that this new system actually isn't so bad that people
*  are getting in.
*  When migrants start getting those messages, that is going to change their decision.
*  That is going to impact the flows.
*  People are not static for long.
*  They are in wait and see mode for now, but that can change really quickly.
*  So what do we know about that?
*  Not at least specifically, what do we know about the people that you saw crossing into
*  the US late last week?
*  What ended up happening to them and what kind of signal might that be to everyone else
*  about whether this is in fact a good or bad moment to try to come into the US?
*  Well, we don't really know yet.
*  There's not a lot of information.
*  Here's what migrants are watching and really what everybody's watching.
*  How successful is the Biden administration going to be at implementing its own policy?
*  And essentially, the question is, how quickly is the Biden administration going to be able
*  to deport large numbers of people?
*  If the Biden administration can quickly deport large numbers of migrants,
*  that is going to send the message that it is not a good time to cross.
*  It remains a bad time to cross and migrants may sit back and wait.
*  But it's not a sure thing that the Biden administration will be able to deport large numbers
*  of people very quickly and efficiently.
*  It's logistically difficult to do that.
*  And if the administration doesn't do that, what we're going to see and what migrants will see
*  is people being let into the country with a notice to appear before an immigration judge
*  basically being allowed to stay and live in the country legally,
*  at least for some period of time while they wait for a hearing.
*  Children, for example, will definitely be let into wait.
*  Families will very likely be let into wait.
*  And if large numbers are being let into wait, that is going to send a message to people at the border
*  that, you know what, there is a chance that at least for some period of time,
*  you could get into the United States.
*  So maybe it isn't so bad to try right now.
*  Right. So you're saying that in this dynamic situation,
*  where migrants are looking for any sign that actually maybe it is a good time to go to the border,
*  even a failure to execute these scary new policies might end up undermining this entire program
*  designed to replace Title 42 for the Biden administration.
*  Oh, it definitely would.
*  And on top of that, there's this other threat to the new system, which is that Biden's new policies
*  are facing a bunch of legal challenges.
*  So tell us about this.
*  So the administration is facing a couple of legal challenges to its new policies.
*  The first legal challenge comes from Florida and it really targets the way the Biden
*  administration is letting migrants out of custody and into the United States.
*  The argument is that this is happening in an unlawful way that puts an undue burden
*  on the local government and the systems in the state.
*  If the lawsuit works, if it's successful, that wouldn't be great for the administration,
*  but it's not really clear what's going to happen with that one.
*  A potentially bigger threat experts are saying is a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union.
*  And basically what the ACLU and others are saying in that suit is that it's not fair and it's
*  a violation of U.S. law to require people to apply for and get rejected for asylum in another
*  country in order to get it in the United States. And if the ACLU succeeds, and even if this rule
*  is just suspended while the litigation is happening, that could be very difficult for the Biden
*  administration because a big part of their policy at the border is making it difficult for people
*  to get in. And if all of a sudden this new rule that makes it harder for people to qualify
*  for this legal status goes away, then again, you could see more people getting in and that would
*  reinforce the message to migrants waiting that now is a good time to try to cross.
*  So at any moment, a judge could just throw this entire system into chaos and all these signals
*  that the White House has been sending not to come could be turned on their head.
*  And the Biden administration will be back to square one.
*  That's a real possibility, I think. And it really speaks to this moment that we're in at the
*  border right now, which is just uncertainty. We really don't know what's going to happen.
*  There are a lot of people waiting in Mexico and there's an administration that is looking at how
*  this is playing out in the courts and how well they're able to execute their own new rules.
*  And things are really in flux.
*  Nellie, I'm curious. Do you know what happened to all the people that you met last week,
*  especially on the beast, that terrifying train that so many of them take to try to get to the border?
*  Yeah, so remember Jonathan Aerevalo, the 33 year old Venezuelan guy that I met on the train.
*  He's been sending me voice memos. We've been keeping in touch since that day.
*  And he told me that he was desperate to try to cross illegally before the end of title 42.
*  He thought that would give him a better chance of making it in.
*  And he told me how he got off the train that day and he basically spent all day and night walking.
*  He stopped for a quick bite to eat and then went straight to the border.
*  But when he got there, he said they ran into people from the cartel.
*  He said that cartel members were attacking a lot of the people around him.
*  He doesn't know what these cartel members were looking for.
*  Maybe it was to rob them, maybe it was to kidnap them.
*  But he's seen enough danger along the way that he knew to turn back.
*  No, I don't know if I'm here in Juarez.
*  So he abandoned that mission of trying to get in and went back to Juarez found a place to sleep.
*  You know, he's working at a fruit store. He's trying to make a little money and he's now waiting it out.
*  He said he's looking at information every day.
*  He is looking to see what happens with this new policy.
*  He's being patient right now.
*  But my sense is that patients isn't going to last long.
*  He said that as soon as he gets any sign that people are getting in, he's going to try.
*  He will cross the border and give it a shot.
*  It just gives you a sense.
*  I mean, this guy has been through a jungle.
*  He's been through several countries, several months of travel.
*  People who have done all of that aren't going to give up that easily.
*  There are tens of thousands of people just like Jonathan that are following close behind.
*  The numbers of people that are going through this jungle, the Darian gap to get here,
*  they are still hovering near record highs.
*  The forces that are driving people to the United States border are bigger than anyone
*  policy can control. It's hunger and poverty, it's economic displacement, it's violence,
*  and those things haven't changed.
*  You know, that's the real issue right now, both for migrants and for the Biden administration.
*  I mean, you have people that have their eyes trained on the border to just see what's going to happen
*  because they are desperate. And for the Biden administration, there's not a lot of leeway there.
*  If this policy doesn't work out the way they want it to, they could see Jonathan and all of the
*  other people that have suffered and sacrificed so much already, just take one more step to try to
*  test this system. And if that happens, all bets are off.
*  Natalie, thank you very much. Thanks Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know day. A special counsel appointed under President Trump
*  to reexamine how the government investigated ties between Trump and Russia issued a final report
*  on Monday that heavily criticized both the FBI and the Department of Justice. The report,
*  overseen by John Durham, found that agents rushed into the investigation of Trump
*  and that their handling of the pro was, quote, seriously, deficient.
*  But Durham's four-year investigation produced little new information, sent no one to prison,
*  and failed to deliver the kind of embarrassing revelations that both Trump and his allies had promised
*  that it would. And a man armed with a baseball bat entered a district office of congressman Jerry
*  Connolly of Virginia on Monday morning and attacked two of his staff members.
*  The motive of the attacker who is now in custody remains unclear, but the incident comes amid a
*  sharp rise in threats against members of congress, including a violent attack last fall
*  on the husband of former house speaker Nancy Pelosi.
