# The Day Title 42 Ended
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndkaZuPlK0o)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is a daily. Today.
*  And we are counting down to chaos. Title 42 will officially expire in less than 18 hours.
*  The pandemic era policy allowed the U.S. government to quickly expel migrants who crossed into
*  the U.S. illegally. After Thursday, it's going to be a free for all. The Biden administration
*  For weeks, officials have feared that the end of Title 42 would create a crisis at the
*  U.S.-Mexico border that would strain and possibly cripple America's immigration system.
*  Title 42 goes away on Thursday and migrants will be in crisis as soon as next week.
*  It will be a humanitarian crisis because we are not prepared.
*  My colleague, Natalie Kichereweth, has been at the border and describes what actually
*  happened when the milestone policy came to an end.
*  It's Tuesday, May 16th.
*  OK, can you hear me? I can hear you.
*  OK, great. We're just pulling up to this part of the border that I'm trying to get to.
*  I'm sorry. It's super dusty. So, Natalie, just by way of context,
*  it's Thursday, May 11th. You're right at the U.S.-Mexico border. It's the middle of the day.
*  Can you just describe exactly where you are geographically and what you're seeing?
*  First of all, I'm seeing the group of migrants, maybe three or four hundred people that have
*  gathered on the other side of the Rio Grande. Crossing the Rio Grande, which, by the way,
*  is not that grand at this particular part of Ciudad Juarez. It's like a shallow and very
*  crossable stream-like body of water almost. And they just have walked across the other side.
*  And there's this barbed wire. They've been going through the barbed wire and now they are between
*  the barbed wire and this massive border wall. That's what you might imagine. It looks like a big,
*  very tall fence. But they're on U.S. soil. And so they want to turn themselves in to border officials,
*  some of them to apply for asylum.
*  Natalie, what does it mean for the people on the other side of this river who are successfully
*  crossing to some degree to do that today? Yeah, we're hours away from this border
*  restriction being lifted. And what that means for folks is that the migration landscape
*  in the United States is about to radically change. They're going to be the first people,
*  we think, depending on when border agents start processing them, to really test out what is
*  this new system. You know, before, under the measure, which is called Title 42,
*  the U.S. government could summarily expel people when they crossed illegally. That's no longer an
*  option anymore starting later tonight. Now, folks who are on U.S. soil are going to have to be
*  processed. It's going to take longer. Whether or not they're actually going to get legal status,
*  we don't know. It's going to be difficult. The Biden administration has put in new rules. And
*  the people that I'm looking at right now are the ones who are really, we think, again, it depends
*  on when they get across or what's really going to happen. But these are going to be the first
*  people to kind of test it out. But if the policy right in this moment before midnight is to summarily
*  expel migrants who come to the border, why is this group crossing now?
*  Honestly, it's impossible to know exactly why any group of migrants is crossing right now.
*  We don't have any really clear sense, and there's just a lot of mixed messaging. So it's difficult
*  to parse the individual rationale of each person. But what we know is that over the last several days,
*  we have seen a rush to the border and we are still seeing people crossing today.
*  And it remains to be seen what's going to happen over the next few days.
*  Right. But as we've said on the show, for weeks, there have been reports
*  of a surge of people coming to the border in anticipation of this change. Do you have any
*  sense of how many people are at or just inside of the border right now?
*  So we've been hearing that there's going to be this massive surge today on the day that this
*  pandemic rule lifts. But the reality is the numbers show that the surge is already here.
*  The number of encounters at the border has gone up to 11,000 a day. That's up from 6,000 a day
*  just a few weeks ago. So that's a huge increase. I mean, in effect, this thing that we were all
*  racing for, it's already upon us. It's been happening. This is the reality at the border
*  right now. Now you have been where you are for the past week. So describe what you have been seeing
*  as all these migrants have arrived at the border. Well, you're seeing people coming in on
*  buses, you're seeing them coming in on planes. And one of the most dangerous ways that they're
*  getting here is on this train that's known as the Beast. It's also known as the train of death,
*  because it's a really dangerous method for people to be traveling. It's this massive
*  cargo train that people risk their lives just getting on. But I wanted to see what it was like
*  to ride it into Juarez, to try to migrate on this train. So I boarded it south of the city.
*  We're sitting here among construction material looks like steel rebar. And I got into a car that
*  was full of steel rebar and about 40 migrants who had been traveling some of them for four days.
*  The guys that I'm talking to said they've seen people killed when they've gotten off it and the
*  train has run over them. There's not much water. There's barely any food. They're hungry. They're
*  scared. It gets so cold at night and during the day it's unbearably hot. And they're surrounded
*  by metal. So during the day touching that scalding hot surface can be dangerous and at night sleeping
*  on it is really uncomfortable. And one of the people I talked to was this 33 year old named
*  Jonathan Arevalo. He's from Venezuela. Jonathan said that danger's been with us since we left.
*  He has crossed the Darien Gap.
*  This treacherous jungle that was once considered impassable but is now basically a highway for
*  migrants to get here. He spent days doing that.
*  His friends told me that they had to basically eat sugar for a couple of days because that's
*  the only food that they had left.
*  Jonathan's saying his choices were basically to stay in Venezuela and risk his life or leave and
*  risk his life. He didn't think he was going to survive in Venezuela so he decided to give it a shot.
*  He's crossed into the United States several times already and been returned under Title 42. He was
*  expelled at a different part of the border from where he entered and then bussed to the south of
*  the country. So that's why he had to take a train all the way up north to try again.
*  And he wanted to try one more time because he actually thinks it's going to get a lot harder
*  when the measure lifts. So Jonathan has heard basically that when the the measure lifts you
*  really could just be deported. I think there's a couple of mixed messages happening here.
*  I don't know what to do. I have to get back and try again.
*  And so he had been on this train trying to make it one last time for several days
*  and he basically said I'm going to walk to the border if I can.
*  And right now we're rolling through
*  Juarez. We're coming from the south up until the north.
*  But when you're on the train as soon as they catch a glimpse of the Juarez city limits,
*  you know a cheer will go up. People are also still really hopeful and when they start to arrive to
*  this city you can feel the kind of spirit lift and people are looking at each other and they're
*  saying you know we finally made it. Of course for many of them this is they hope the last leg of a
*  very long journey but I think they know and we know that there's no guarantee that this is really
*  the end of it. And the questions that the administration is asking itself and that we're
*  all waiting to see is how long that takes, how much chaos unfolds, and whether the system gets overloaded.
*  Well Natalie thank you for now and we will check back in with you
*  once Title 42 is lifted and everything is different.
*  Sounds good. Thanks Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Natalie when we talked to you on Thursday during that afternoon things were looking to be
*  at kind of a fever pitch. There was this sudden wave of migrants at the border, the shelters on
*  the U.S. side were full, everyone had this question in their mind is this going to basically break
*  the United States system for processing migrants? So what ended up happening once Title 42 was
*  actually lifted? Well it didn't break the system and it turned out that what we'd been seeing
*  over the last few days that was kind of the peak and so when the clock struck midnight
*  eastern time I was sitting there watching the border. I was looking at the Rio Grande and
*  looking at this group of migrants waiting to try to get in. It wasn't getting any bigger,
*  we weren't seeing a big rush to the border. You know for the whole week we had kind of seen people
*  walking with their kids and their belongings toward the border. We didn't see any of that
*  that night. I mean it was really calm from where I was standing there was a lot of news media,
*  there were a lot of cameras pointed at the border wall but what they were capturing was a pretty
*  tranquil scene. How do you explain that Natalie? That the worst case scenario for the U.S.
*  didn't quite materialize. It sounds like perhaps the president's message about the end of Title 42
*  don't come, the border isn't open, perhaps sunk in. Well yeah I think a lot of people on both
*  sides of the border think that Biden and his administration were very clear that the new rules
*  being put in place were not going to mean open doors at the border and there's some sense that
*  that message filtered down into the migrant WhatsApp groups, the Facebook groups, the chats
*  that are constantly spreading that information and I was talking to migrants in Juarez who were
*  telling me that you know they had heard this message from the Biden administration. Right
*  because so much of the information that these migrants were receiving and spreading
*  seemed to be that this wasn't a good time to come because of these new rules that you just
*  referenced and Natalie we talked about these rules last week with our colleague Miriam Jordan
*  but just briefly remind us why these new rules would have this cumulative effect of making people
*  pause, wait, not rush to the border. So remember that under Title 42 there was a benefit for
*  migrants. There was a built-in incentive to cross the border illegally because if you cross the
*  border illegally and got caught you would probably be expelled immediately from the country but there
*  was no black mark on your record. As soon as Title 42 lifts that's over. If you are caught crossing
*  illegally migrants know that you could be subject to criminal proceedings and most importantly there's
*  a five-year ban on re-entering the United States and so the migrants that I talked to are terrified
*  of this. This is the last thing that they want and it's really on their minds this notion that they
*  wouldn't be able to try to come back in if this didn't work. And the other issue that they're
*  talking about is this new set of rules that makes it really hard to qualify for asylum which is
*  this legal status that gives you protection from persecution in your home country. If migrants
*  tried to claim asylum under these new restrictions Biden put in place you have to prove that you
*  requested and were rejected for asylum in Mexico or another country that you pass through on the
*  way to the United States. There were some exceptions baked into these new rules but all of the migrants
*  that I talked to felt that these new rules made it essentially impossible for many of them to qualify
*  for this kind of protected status. So you know the overwhelming sense or the fear really was that
*  the new system being put in place was bad. Right which is exactly what the president and those
*  around him hoped would be the message that reached these migrants and as you have just explained
*  Natalie it seemed it did reach them and it resulted in the averting of a momentary surge
*  perhaps even a crisis at the border over the past few days when this three-year-old emergency
*  rule came to an end. Yeah it does seem that that may have happened at least in the short term but
*  honestly the border is an extremely dynamic place and people are making decisions based on information
*  that changes daily and you know the slightest sign that this new system actually isn't so bad
*  that people are getting in when migrants start getting those messages that is going to change
*  their decision that is going to impact the flows. People are not static for long they are in wait
*  and see mode for now but that can change really quickly. Well so what do we know about that Natalie
*  specifically what do we know about the people that you saw crossing into the U.S. late last week
*  what ended up happening to them and what kind of signal might that be to everyone else
*  about whether this is in fact a good or bad moment to try to come into the U.S.
*  Well we don't really know yet there's not a lot of information but here's what migrants are watching
*  and really what everybody's watching how successful is the Biden administration going to be at
*  implementing its own policy and essentially the question is how quickly is the Biden administration
*  going to be able to deport large numbers of people if the Biden administration can quickly
*  deport large numbers of migrants that is going to send the message that it is not a good time to
*  cross it remains a bad time to cross and migrants may sit back and wait but it's not a sure thing
*  that the Biden administration will be able to deport large numbers of people very quickly and
*  efficiently it's logistically difficult to do that and if the administration doesn't do that
*  what we're going to see and what migrants will see is people being let into the country with a
*  notice to appear before an immigration judge basically being allowed to stay and live in the
*  country legally at least for some period of time while they wait for a hearing children for example
*  will definitely be let in to wait families will very likely be let in to wait and if large numbers
*  are being led in to wait that is going to send a message to people at the border that you know
*  what there is a chance that at least for some period of time you could get into the United
*  States so maybe it isn't so bad to try right now right so you're saying that in this dynamic
*  situation where migrants are looking for any sign that actually maybe it is a good time to go to the
*  border even a failure to execute these scary new policies might end up undermining this entire
*  program designed to replace title 42 for the Biden administration oh it definitely would
*  and on top of that there's this other threat to the new system which is that Biden's new policies
*  are facing a bunch of legal challenges so tell us about this so the administration is facing a couple
*  of legal challenges to its new policies the first legal challenge comes from Florida and it really
*  targets the way the Biden administration is letting migrants out of custody and into the
*  United States the argument is that this is happening in an unlawful way that puts an
*  undue burden on the local government and the systems in the state if the lawsuit works if
*  it's successful that wouldn't be great for the administration but it's not really clear what's
*  going to happen with that one a potentially bigger threat experts are saying is a lawsuit filed by
*  the American Civil Liberties Union and basically what the ACLU and others are saying in that suit
*  is that it's not fair and it's a violation of US law to require people to apply for and get rejected
*  for asylum in another country in order to get it in the United States and if the ACLU succeeds and
*  even if this rule is just suspended while the litigation is happening that could be very
*  difficult for the Biden administration because a big part of their policy at the border is making
*  it difficult for people to get in and if all of a sudden this new rule that makes it harder for
*  people to qualify for this legal status goes away then again you could see more people getting in
*  and that would reinforce the message to migrants waiting that now is a good time to try to cross
*  so at any moment a judge could just throw this entire system into chaos and all these signals
*  that the White House has been sending not to come could be turned on their head and the Biden
*  administration will be back to square one that's a real possibility I think and you know it really
*  speaks to this moment that we're in at the border right now which is just uncertainty we really
*  don't know what's going to happen there are a lot of people waiting in Mexico and there's an
*  administration that is looking at how this is playing out in the courts and how well they're
*  able to execute their own new rules and things are really in flux. Nellie I'm curious do you know
*  what happened to all the people that you met last week especially on the beast that terrifying train
*  that so many of them take to try to get to the border? Yeah so remember Jonathan Arevalo the 33
*  year old Venezuelan guy that I met on the train he's been sending me voice memos we've been keeping
*  in touch since that day and he told me that you know he was desperate to try to cross illegally
*  before the end of title 42 he thought that would give him a better chance of making it in.
*  And he told me how he got off the train that day and he basically spent all day and night walking.
*  He stopped for a quick bite to eat and then went straight to the border
*  but when he got there he said they ran into people from the cartel.
*  He said that cartel members were attacking a lot of the people around him he doesn't know what these
*  cartel members were looking for maybe it was to rob them maybe it was to kidnap them but he's seen
*  enough danger along the way that he knew to turn back. So he abandoned that mission of trying to get
*  in and went back to Juarez found a place to sleep.
*  You know he's working at a fruit store he's trying to make a little money and he's now waiting it out
*  he said he's looking at information every day he is looking to see what happens with this new policy.
*  He's being patient right now but my sense is that patience isn't going to last long he said that as
*  soon as he gets any sign that people are getting in he's going to try he will cross the border
*  and give it a shot and you know it just gives you a sense I mean this guy has been through
*  a jungle he's been through several countries several months of travel people who have done all
*  of that aren't going to give up that easily and you know there are tens of thousands of people
*  just like Jonathan that are following close behind the numbers of people that are going through this
*  jungle the Darien Gap to get here they are still hovering near record highs.
*  The forces that are driving people to the United States border are bigger than any one policy can
*  control its hunger and poverty its economic displacement its violence and those things haven't
*  changed and you know that's the real issue right now both for migrants and for the bide
*  administration I mean you have people that have their eyes trained on the border to just see what's
*  going to happen because they are desperate and for the bide administration there's not a lot of leeway
*  there if this policy doesn't work out the way they want it to they could see Jonathan and all of the
*  other people that have suffered and sacrificed so much already just take one more step to try to
*  test this system and if that happens all bets are off.
*  Natalie thank you very much. Thanks Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. A special counsel appointed under President Trump to
*  re-examine how the government investigated ties between Trump and Russia issued a final report
*  on Monday that heavily criticized both the FBI and the Department of Justice. The report
*  overseen by John Durham found that agents rushed into the investigation of Trump and the FBI
*  into the investigation of Trump and that their handling of the probe was quote seriously deficient
*  but Durham's four-year investigation produced little new information sent no one to prison
*  and failed to deliver the kind of embarrassing revelations that both Trump and his allies had
*  promised that it would and a man armed with a baseball bat entered a district office of
*  Congressman Jerry Connolly of Virginia on Monday morning and attacked two of his staff members.
*  The motive of the attacker who is now in custody remains unclear but the incident comes amid a
*  sharp rise in threats against members of Congress including a violent attack last fall on the husband
*  of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Today's episode was produced by Carlos Prieto,
