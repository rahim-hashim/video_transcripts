# Sunday Special: Un-Marry Me!
**New York Times Podcasts:** [February 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wz__oE1ULs)
*  Hey, it's Michael.
*  Most weekends we bring you the Sunday read, but today we're doing something a little
*  bit different.
*  Sharing the latest episode of Modern Love, a podcast from New York Times Audio that explores
*  the complicated love lives of regular people.
*  Enjoy it, and if you like it, head over to the Modern Love feed for new episodes every
*  Wednesday.
*  Take a listen.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Anna Martin.
*  This is Modern Love.
*  Welcome to a new season.
*  If you listen to the show, you're clearly into stories about relationships.
*  So you may have heard of a guy named Dave Finch.
*  There was a time when a lot of people wanted to hear his ideas about making relationships
*  work because he seemed to have solved a big problem in his own marriage.
*  As he tells it, the problem stemmed from his overpowering need for order and predictability.
*  And it came out in all kinds of everyday situations with his wife, Kristin, and their two kids.
*  Take this for example.
*  I had it in my head that nap time was 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock.
*  And if the 2 o'clock nap didn't happen because somebody dropped over for a visit or because
*  they were, you know, fussy and not going down for a nap, I would start to almost spiral
*  in a way.
*  It was this sense of panic.
*  And I would lash out and try to seize control.
*  And she would say, why are you freaking out, Dave?
*  I already have two babies who won't go down for a nap.
*  And now I have a husband who's freaking out because babies won't.
*  They're babies.
*  They don't always take a nap.
*  And I remember saying to her, you told me nap time is 10 and 2.
*  So if it's not 10 and 2, you have to tell me that.
*  And she was thinking, why would I have to tell you that?
*  Be an adult.
*  I can't be a third person in this house I have to take care of.
*  Tensions kept building between the two of them.
*  But then they had a breakthrough.
*  Dave went to a psychiatrist.
*  Five minutes into the conversation, he was like, you can stop.
*  You have Asperger's.
*  This was in 2008.
*  So they were still using the word Asperger's.
*  But it was so revelatory for me because for three years, the most important person in
*  my life was saying things like, you just don't get it, Dave.
*  And in that moment, she saw me not as a husband who is a walking checklist of deficits, but
*  as a human being who is wired a certain way, who doesn't mean to be making things difficult
*  all the time.
*  It's not all his fault.
*  These days, the term Asperger's isn't used much.
*  But it refers to an autism spectrum disorder.
*  After that diagnosis, Dave began to understand all the ways his brain worked differently.
*  The autistic mind craves predictability.
*  And when that prediction doesn't match reality, it's considered a personal violation.
*  And that's why the autistic brain starts to spiral and feel very anxious and dysregulated.
*  I needed to understand what was expected of me, how I needed to show up in those situations.
*  I really needed a sense of control, a sense of structure, a sense of predictability.
*  Dave couldn't get predictability, but maybe he could figure out how to be a better partner.
*  So he came up with an idea.
*  Every time Kristen got frustrated with him about something he did or didn't do, he wrote
*  it down.
*  So maybe he could get it right the next time.
*  One rule he had was be present in moments with the kids, which meant playing with them
*  instead of getting annoyed when they didn't follow exactly the rules of a game.
*  Another rule was just listen.
*  When Kristen had a problem, she didn't need a literal spreadsheet of solutions.
*  All she wanted was for him to show a little empathy.
*  Dave's list of rules got longer and longer.
*  Don't change the radio station when she's singing along.
*  Don't sneak up on her and surprise her when she's pouring coffee.
*  She hates that.
*  Apologies do not count when you shout them.
*  Don't just take what you need from the dryer.
*  Fold all the clothes and put them away.
*  He wrote all these rules down on post-it notes and little scraps of paper and kept them in
*  a drawer in his bedside table.
*  Dave talked about all this in a modern love essay, which led to a bestselling book called
*  The Journal of Best Practices, a memoir of marriage, Asperger syndrome, and one man's
*  quest to be a better husband.
*  And he became a public speaker.
*  Thank you.
*  And it's really exciting for me to be able to come and talk to you this morning.
*  Sharing what he learned with other struggling couples.
*  The big game changer for people is adaptability.
*  A willingness and an ability to change, to adapt, to unlearn old behaviors.
*  Man, it's hard, but it is possible.
*  Thank you.
*  Seems like a happy ending, right?
*  But listen to this one interview Dave did at the time.
*  Ira Glass, the host of This American Life, asked Dave how Kristen felt about one of his
*  best practices.
*  It was the rule about acting empathetic.
*  But wait, is that satisfying for her?
*  I mean, if you say to her, like, God, that must be terrible for you, and you're not really
*  empathizing and she knows you're just saying it by rote because you've been trained to
*  do it, is that actually satisfying to her?
*  That's a really great point.
*  I can now surmise, you know, using intellect, that yes, that must have been very trying
*  for her.
*  Still, Dave stuck to his best practices for a few more years until one day.
*  I'd just gotten out of the shower and Kristen marched into the bathroom and said, I have
*  a revelation to share with you.
*  We're done being married.
*  We're just done.
*  And I said, wait, wait, wait, wait, what do you mean we're done?
*  She's like, this marriage, this thing we're doing, the thing we've been doing, it's exhausting
*  for both of us.
*  We're not doing that anymore.
*  We're just, we're done being married.
*  I said, wait a minute, wait a minute.
*  I've been doing the best practices.
*  I've been working the method.
*  I'm about to go give a lecture in Missouri about how to be a great partner in a marriage.
*  I said, so we were separating?
*  She said, no, more like we're detaching.
*  And I remember asking, detaching?
*  What does that even mean?
*  Because to me, it sounds like we're not married anymore.
*  And she said, you know what, Dave, we'll call this unmarried.
*  And then she just turned around and left the room.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Kristin had just dropped this major bomb on Dave, right as he was getting out of the shower,
*  no less.
*  So was this the end of their marriage or just another bump in the road?
*  I asked Dave to sit down and talk with me about it.
*  Dave, welcome to Modern Love.
*  Thank you so much for coming on the show.
*  Thank you so much.
*  I can't wait to have this conversation together.
*  So let's pick up where we left off.
*  What did you do after Kristin told you she wanted to be unmarried?
*  You were literally heading to give a talk about how to have a successful marriage.
*  I had to climb in the car and drive all the way down through Illinois to get to Missouri.
*  And then drive through Missouri.
*  And I had given so many talks at that point.
*  I wasn't worried.
*  I knew I could get my way through the talk.
*  The bigger picture was like, I'm about to go tell these people this.
*  And my wife just said, I don't want to be married anymore.
*  Yeah, what was going through your head on that drive?
*  I just replayed that moment over and over.
*  What could she mean?
*  I didn't go to a place of positivity when she said that.
*  The eight or nine hours I had in the car right after that moment were catastrophizing and
*  trying to imagine new scenarios of what our life would look like.
*  But really it was just replaying with deafening loudness the conversation that we had had
*  that morning.
*  Oh, Dave, I'm like feeling really crushed.
*  It was a moment where I felt I had lost my partner.
*  I was starting to feel what must have been grief.
*  What you thought it meant then was, we're done.
*  Yes.
*  It just sounded to me like this is the first step in what is ultimately going to lead to
*  divorce.
*  And I thought it's not even that I need Kristin to be my wife.
*  The scary thing for me was everything I was doing, it's still not good enough.
*  How is this person going to stay in my life if I can't be good enough even after all this
*  work?
*  That was the scariest part for me.
*  In the days and weeks after that conversation in the bathroom, you started to see what Kristin
*  meant by unmarrying.
*  What did you see her doing as she put unmarrying into action in her own life?
*  I was very confused.
*  Since she wouldn't give me a definitive, we are terminating the marriage, I knew that
*  we were still in a relationship.
*  I remember even asking her at one point, am I supposed to be dating other people?
*  She's like, God, no.
*  I was like, okay, so we're still faithful to each other, right?
*  Which is good because I don't want to go out there and start dating people.
*  And I'd asked her, does that mean I don't have to do household chores?
*  She's like, no, you still have to do the dishes.
*  I was like, God damn it.
*  But as I started observing her, what she was doing was going out and having long coffee
*  dates with friends.
*  And she was treating herself to leisurely strolls in the mid-morning.
*  She was journaling.
*  She was reading books by Brene Brown and Annie Lamott and all these great thinkers.
*  And she was like, Dave, go mountain biking, take trips by yourself, go whatever.
*  And so I started aping her work.
*  Okay, Dave, I got to know what that meant for you.
*  I started saying, well, I've noticed that she's really gotten into essential oils and
*  burning white sage and energy clearing the house.
*  I could do that too.
*  So check this out.
*  Here's my white sage that I still.
*  Well, there you go.
*  Oh my God.
*  I went full woo for about three months where I had my chakras tested.
*  And that didn't feel right.
*  I was like, I'm not experiencing the joy that she seems to be experiencing in her new Kristen
*  Renaissance of just living her life outside of the marriage.
*  So then I tried to get myself some friends and I architected how to get friends and I
*  went out there and I experimented and I was needing from them all the stuff I was needing
*  from Kristen, which was like this constant sort of brotherhood, companionship, awesomeness.
*  And after a while I was too much for them and they were like, dude, I don't want to
*  be macho with you anymore.
*  This sucks.
*  I mean, during this time, if you went somewhere together and you had to introduce her, what
*  would you even say?
*  Like, how would you explain your situation to someone?
*  So at this time I was meeting a lot of new people, a lot of philanthropists, a lot of
*  business people, and I had to go to a bunch of different functions and stuff.
*  And sometimes Kristen came along and when we went somewhere and I would introduce her,
*  I would introduce her kind of awkwardly as my not wife anymore.
*  Oh my God, Dave.
*  I'd be like, hi, I'm Dave.
*  This is my not really my wife, Kristen.
*  We're kind of married, but apparently we're not.
*  And she would get so angry.
*  What would she say?
*  She would roll her eyes and go, oh my God, I'm his wife.
*  I'm Kristen.
*  She did not love that I had taken off and put away my wedding ring and put that in a
*  drawer and I replaced it with a skull ring that I had bought from an artist in Spain.
*  Oh my God.
*  You're taking this.
*  You are confused, but you're taking it to a different level.
*  Yeah, I was very chippy about this.
*  This was like, I didn't sign up for Unmarried.
*  I didn't work this hard for the last six years to be floundering like this.
*  But I wasn't introducing Kristen as my not really my wife anymore.
*  To get under her skin, I truly thought that I couldn't introduce her as my wife anymore
*  and that I didn't know what else to call her since we were both clearly married.
*  And I mean, through all this, you're watching Kristen seem comfortable with your new relationship
*  dynamic.
*  She's having a life.
*  She's having fun outside your relationship.
*  And when you try to do similar things, it's not working.
*  Was it confusing to you?
*  Was it painful?
*  Yes.
*  So what I was observing was Kristen doing the work that was helping her to thrive.
*  And it was bringing her back online.
*  It was bringing her joy back into the world.
*  She was alive again.
*  She was flourishing.
*  And I was still struggling and I felt very lonely in that.
*  There are periods where I even felt resentful where I was like, so she has moved on from
*  trying to be somebody who the marriage is all that makes her happy.
*  She's moved on from that.
*  She's running a different playbook now.
*  And I felt sort of abandoned in my ridiculous best practices and frankly felt like I was
*  floundering.
*  And how long did it take for being unmarried to start making sense to you?
*  One of the very first times that I understood what she meant by unmarried, probably four
*  maybe five years after she introduced the idea to me, was that she was done managing
*  my energy.
*  Wait, four or five years?
*  Yes.
*  Wow.
*  So the next phrase that she coined after unmarried was energy manager.
*  And she was done running 10 steps ahead of me, making sure that the environment that
*  I was in was something safe, feeling and predictable and within my control.
*  Because if I got into a bad mood, then she would get into a bad mood.
*  So to avoid me getting into a bad mood and her ultimately feeling that same way, she
*  would prevent the sort of things that she knew would trigger my bad moods.
*  And it was exhausting for her and I didn't even know that she was doing this.
*  So she was this unwilling participant in my grand experiment to create the best possible
*  husband.
*  What she was saying was, I'm out of the experiment and neither one of us needs to be working
*  this hard all the time.
*  You stop trying to be this perfect husband.
*  I'm going to stop trying to manage your moods and your energy and being your partner in
*  this big experiment.
*  I'm going to work on making myself happy.
*  I suggest you do the same.
*  If we're going to stay together, I really need you to be happy for yourself by yourself
*  and then we come together in the middle and share that happiness.
*  Wow.
*  I mean, that feels like progress.
*  I totally get what she's saying too about energy manager.
*  That's so real.
*  But I mean, now you have to manage your own energy.
*  How did you do that?
*  A fellow classroom dad, the parents of somebody that my kids went to school with, pulled me
*  aside and was like, hey, you ever been mountain biking?
*  You want to go mountain biking with us this weekend?
*  Me and a group of guys are going.
*  I was like, oh yeah, okay.
*  And I was immediately addicted.
*  First ride, I was like, I need to do this every day for the rest of my life and I am
*  all in.
*  And Kristen said, perfect, Dave, that's the sort of heat that you need to follow.
*  Follow that, chase that feeling.
*  What does that feel like?
*  You don't need me to be part of that.
*  Go find a hobby that lights you up.
*  And so I was like, all right.
*  One of the first times where I thought, you know, maybe this unmarried isn't so bad.
*  I was flying weightlessly down the side of a mountain in Park City, Utah, having the
*  life, laughing out loud, hooting, hollering, feeling every turn and every jump and every
*  near death experience with a tree or a rock and laughing the whole way down the mountain.
*  And I got to the bottom and I thought, you know what?
*  I'm here by myself.
*  This feels like my soul is alive and on fire and I love it.
*  And I texted Kristen, I was like, I think I know what you mean.
*  The previously married you, not the unmarried you, would not have done that, would not have
*  leaned into this hobby, would not have leaned into this freedom.
*  No, because my Asperger model for faithful good husband was you do everything with your
*  spouse, everything that you do that you enjoy, every hobby, every undertaking, every lawn
*  project, every whatever is with your partner.
*  I had become someone who was determined to be Dave Finch relative to his marriage with
*  Kristen.
*  And if it's a good marriage, then I'm a good guy to be around.
*  And if it's a bad marriage, then I suck.
*  But behind the scenes, Kristen had a different take.
*  She was looking at it like he's going to all this trouble, all this effort, living
*  and dying by rules.
*  And Kristen was like, why don't you be Dave Finch?
*  I'll be Kristen Finch.
*  We'll have our marriage.
*  And Dave, your hobby cannot be our relationship.
*  I started to see that what Kristen really meant, and this is semantics, she probably
*  meant anti-married.
*  The way that we are married is not working.
*  We're going to flip it.
*  It was more of a divestment from all the things that were really holding us up in our relationship
*  as opposed to a termination of a marriage.
*  I just want to be clear.
*  Unmarried, anti-married kind of looks a lot like just being married.
*  Yes, we are still totally subscribed to the traditional trappings of a marriage, meaning
*  we still live together.
*  We are intimate with each other.
*  We are exclusively faithful.
*  Neither one of us has any intention, design, desire to go outside of the marriage for anything
*  other than friendships and hobbies.
*  It's more that we have parted ways with the other traditional trappings of marriage, which
*  is expectations and me needing you to be this thing that will never materialize, me needing
*  the relationship to feel a certain way.
*  We are anti-married because by throwing those things aside, we actually have more room to
*  enjoy watching each other flourish, supporting each other, cheering each other on, being
*  there when things are hard for each other.
*  The aspects of our marriage that we wanted in the first place, which is that joy of being
*  together.
*  The marriage that she was done having was the marriage where everything was a project.
*  She was looking at it like, he's going to all this effort.
*  I just want to sit on the couch with him and watch TV.
*  I just want to take a road trip with him and the kids to an amusement park and just have
*  fun together.
*  I don't want everything to be a homework assignment.
*  But now, thanks to Kristin's wisdom, we are committed to our own happiness first so that
*  we can bring our happy selves to this relationship.
*  When Kristin said, hey, Dave, we're detaching, we're unmarried.
*  She knew that I wasn't going to organically feel my way through a very gray situation.
*  She knows that I need parameters.
*  I need language.
*  And I think she needed the language too.
*  So Dave, have you gotten better at navigating those gray areas?
*  Can you give me an example of what it's been like for you to ease up on your project of
*  having rules for everything in your life with Kristin?
*  I have.
*  Here's an example.
*  This past Thanksgiving, Kristin decided, hey, we're going to do a friendsgiving with her
*  closest friend, basically her sister, her ride or die down in Texas.
*  And I said, sure, we'll do a friendsgiving.
*  But behind it, what I'm thinking is, well, wait, Thanksgiving is a very specific set of
*  events that happen.
*  And now we're changing that.
*  Is this even going to be a Thanksgiving?
*  Or is it going to be just a complete nebulous, undefined scary fest for three or four days?
*  It wasn't even defined how long we would be there.
*  That's tough for you.
*  It is tough for me.
*  And the first impulse that comes into my mind is, all right, we need some parameters on
*  this.
*  I need to understand how do they prepare their turkey?
*  Is it brined?
*  Is it deep fried?
*  This is Texas.
*  It's Dallas.
*  So is it going to be barbecued somehow, like under the ground with some kind of seasoning
*  on it?
*  I don't know how they do it.
*  So then I decide, all right, you see what you're doing here, self.
*  You could beat yourself up for the next three or four weeks and try to understand this and
*  be miserable by the time you get in the car to go to Dallas.
*  Or you could set one rule.
*  And that one rule is there really are no rules.
*  When we go down there, if you're having fun, then things are going in the right direction.
*  Wow.
*  Did your hack of the one rule is there's no rules?
*  Did it work?
*  It did.
*  And I knew it was working the next morning on the drive because normally I insist on
*  driving always.
*  And I actually let Kristin drive for a couple hours and we all just had fun in the car.
*  And I think if you're on a family trip and you're all having fun by the time you reach
*  your destination, you're still having fun and laughing and it's going well.
*  That's a miracle.
*  Yeah.
*  So after this 12, 13 hour drive, we pull into our friend's driveway.
*  And what I didn't know is that things were just going to get even better.
*  These are like exceedingly decent people, which means that they do not tart up their
*  Thanksgiving dinner.
*  It was a turkey.
*  It was perfect.
*  Like everything you wanted in a turkey.
*  Like it was just a turkey.
*  The best thing was the moments when Kristin would come over with either a glass of wine
*  or a cup of tea or whatever, Kristin would come over and just sit down next to me and
*  kind of lay into me like a blanket.
*  And I was like, all right, this is, I could do friendsgiving if that's what this is.
*  I could do this every year.
*  The whole thing from start to finish, as much as I wasn't sure about a friendsgiving, I'm
*  not sure I would do it any other way now.
*  Dave Finch, I truly feel like I took a masterclass in relationships and emotion and marriage.
*  After all this, do you still stand by your list of best practices?
*  All of the best practices amounted to a surface clean to fix myself so that I would appear
*  to be the world's greatest partner.
*  My bigger work than my deeper clean is to be somebody who goes out and creates for himself
*  a life that they can then share with that chosen partner.
*  But I stand by it and so does Kristin.
*  There were a couple of clunkers.
*  Some of them were truly admittedly...
*  We all got some clunkers.
*  Some of them were aspirational.
*  The two that come to mind are the laundry thing, right?
*  I still to this day root through the dryer for the one or two things I need and leave
*  the rest in there.
*  Oh, I wish you hadn't told me that.
*  Oh, we'd come to such an understanding.
*  I'm so sorry, Anna.
*  You just hurt my heart, but okay.
*  I have my limitations and that's one of them.
*  I'll take it one step further.
*  Since I am no longer somebody who pines for everyone to like him, I'll admit this to you
*  as well.
*  Only do I do that.
*  I will root through the dirty clothes hamper to take out my dirty stuff and just wash that.
*  Because it makes it so much easier when it's in the dryer for me to just take it out because
*  I don't have to sift through other people's clothes.
*  All right, listeners, you can direct your hate mail to...
*  Kristin Finch.
