# Drunkenness, Women and Wokeness A Dramatic Confirmation Hearing for Pete Hegseth
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=5.08s)]
*  On Tuesday, the confirmation process for Donald Trump's cabinet began with his most controversial [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=14.8s)]
*  choice, Pete Hegseth for Secretary of Defense. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=20.36s)]
*  Today, my colleague, National Security Correspondent Eric Schmidt, on the contentious and dramatic [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=24.92s)]
*  hearing and the odds that Hegseth will soon be running the military. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  It's Wednesday, January 15th. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=38.36s)]
*  Eric, from the moment that Pete Hegseth was nominated to run the Department of Defense, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=42.64s)]
*  it created a storm of controversy on both sides of the aisle because of the reports [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=50.6s)]
*  of his personal misconduct, because of his views on issues like whether women should [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=56.08s)]
*  be in the military, and because of his lack of traditional management experience. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  Everything about him represented a major deviation from the norm of who the Secretary of Defense [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=66.6s)]
*  is, so much so that it looked like Donald Trump might dump him as his choice, but that [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=71.12s)]
*  hasn't happened. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=76.14s)]
*  So heading into this confirmation hearing, what for you were the big questions about [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=77.4s)]
*  how this very highly anticipated day would unfold? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=84.2s)]
*  Well I think you said it's just amazing how unconventional Pete Hegseth's nomination is. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=89.88000000000001s)]
*  I mean, when his nomination was announced, we all kind of scratched our heads and you [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  mean the Fox News anchor, that guy? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=99.68s)]
*  And as it turned out, he did have a record. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=102.76s)]
*  He had run a couple of veterans groups, and then some of the allegations started seeping [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  out about his misconduct. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=112.64s)]
*  The Times unearthed a letter from his mother in 2018 saying he treats women terribly. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=115.16000000000001s)]
*  His mom later said that she wrote that letter in anger, but still. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=121.36000000000001s)]
*  Then we learned about an alleged sexual assault in 2017. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  So these things are starting to pile up. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=131.52s)]
*  And then we talked to former colleagues of his who talk about allegations of public drunkenness. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=133.56s)]
*  I mean, any one of these things would have been enough to sink a nominee in another time, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=139.56s)]
*  but not Pete Hegseth. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=147.66000000000003s)]
*  So going into the hearing, I think there were really three major questions about how it [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=149.72s)]
*  would unfold. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=154.08s)]
*  The first would be, what do the Democrats do? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=155.24s)]
*  Do they recognize this is a foregone conclusion and basically meet Pete Hegseth on his own [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=158.76s)]
*  terms, or do they go to war with him? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  The second for Republicans, do they acknowledge any misgivings at all about Pete Hegseth's [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  conduct, his fitness for the job, his experience, anything at all that would appear to give [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=176.6s)]
*  a crack in their support for him? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=184.92s)]
*  Or do they just fall in line? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=186.96s)]
*  And then the third question is, how would Pete Hegseth carry himself? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=193.72s)]
*  Again, remember, this is the firebrand Fox News commentator. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=194.72s)]
*  He's used to being on television and really being hard edged in the MAGA world. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=197.84s)]
*  Or do we see a different version of him where he's kind of buttoned up the Princeton grad [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=204.32s)]
*  and ready to play nice with Democrats and maybe soften some of their opposition? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=209.72s)]
*  Which Pete Hegseth shows up in what form and how does he present himself in this hearing? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=215.42s)]
*  Right, the firebrand or the charmer. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=220.85999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=223.1s)]
*  Or some combination. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=224.1s)]
*  So given those three big questions going into this hearing, take us into the actual confirmation [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=225.77999999999997s)]
*  hearing itself as you tried to figure out which way it was going to go for each of those [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=233.82s)]
*  three constituencies, Republicans, Democrats, and Hegseth himself. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=239.06s)]
*  So the hearing starts at 930 on Tuesday morning. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=243.68s)]
*  And this is the Senate Armed Services Committee. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=247.4s)]
*  And their job is basically to recommend or not for all their Senate colleagues how should [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=250.52s)]
*  they vote on this guy. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=257.74s)]
*  Again, remember, Republicans are in control as of the last election. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=259.32s)]
*  But there's a very narrow margin and it's still a question of whether the Republicans [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=263.1s)]
*  will hold together. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=267.0s)]
*  So Hegseth takes his seat in front of the dais and he looks like kind of like you would [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=269.5s)]
*  see him on television. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=275.58s)]
*  He's sporting a navy blue suit with a red tie, an American flag pocket square, and his [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=276.58s)]
*  wife and several other women, including Megyn Kelly, are sitting right behind him in support. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=283.86s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=290.22s)]
*  The hearing will come to order. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=291.22s)]
*  Roger Wicker of Mississippi is the chairman who starts with an opening statement. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=293.58s)]
*  Admittedly, this nomination is unconventional. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=299.34s)]
*  The nominee is unconventional, just like that New York developer who rode down the escalator [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=302.82s)]
*  in 2015 to announce his candidacy for president. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=311.14s)]
*  That may be what makes Mr. Hegseth an excellent choice. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=316.14s)]
*  Wicker signals pretty much from his opening statement the Republicans are going to be [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=320.65999999999997s)]
*  He is a decorated post-9-11 combat veteran. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=326.3s)]
*  He will inject a new warrior ethos into the Pentagon, a spirit that can cascade from the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=333.58s)]
*  top down. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=339.09999999999997s)]
*  Mr. Hegseth will bring energy and fresh ideas to shake up the bureaucracy. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=340.65999999999997s)]
*  You know, the Biden administration has weakened the American military. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=345.06s)]
*  The American service members are worn out. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=351.18s)]
*  The Marine is in the tank. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=355.22s)]
*  It's just, you know, we need a jolt here. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=356.98s)]
*  In short, I'm confident that Mr. Hegseth, supported by a team of experienced top officials, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=359.82000000000005s)]
*  will get the job done. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=364.98s)]
*  And so this very quickly from the chairman of the committee makes it sound, you know, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=366.78000000000003s)]
*  there's not going to be any doubts raised from his side of the aisle here at least. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=373.02000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=378.3s)]
*  And given that original question you posed, it now seems that Republicans will not be [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=379.3s)]
*  acknowledging any misgivings about Pete Hegseth that they had early on. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=382.94s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=387.58s)]
*  I mean, there are no reservations at all. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=388.58s)]
*  It's full speed ahead. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=389.78s)]
*  Mr. Hegseth, I welcome you and your family to today's hearing. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=391.53999999999996s)]
*  And then we get our first statement from the senior Democrat on the committee, Senator [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=396.17999999999995s)]
*  Jack Reed of Rhode Island, who's been on the committee for years, is a West Point graduate [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=402.67999999999995s)]
*  Army veteran himself. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=410.3s)]
*  And he actually starts out with some niceties. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=411.3s)]
*  Mr. Hegseth, I want to begin by saying that I respect and appreciate your military service [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=414.86s)]
*  in the Army National Guard. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=419.38s)]
*  I know from experience that there is no greater privilege than to lead American soldiers. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=421.1s)]
*  And I thank you for answering the call. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=427.02000000000004s)]
*  But then Reed, who's a relatively soft-spoken guy, not bombastic at all. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=428.82s)]
*  The secretary is expected to be a fair, nonpartisan and responsible leader, as well as a trustworthy [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=435.78s)]
*  advocate for the men and women that he leads. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=442.97999999999996s)]
*  Mr. Hegseth, I do not believe that you are qualified to meet the overwhelming demands [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=446.78s)]
*  of this job. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=451.58s)]
*  We must acknowledge the concerning public reports against you. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=453.29999999999995s)]
*  He just launches into this extraordinarily harsh assessment of Pete Hegseth's qualifications. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=457.46s)]
*  A variety of sources, including your own writings, implicate you with disregarding the laws of [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=464.65999999999997s)]
*  war, financial mismanagement, racist and sexist remarks about men and women in uniform, alcohol [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=470.41999999999996s)]
*  abuse, sexual assault, sexual harassment and other troubling issues. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=477.85999999999996s)]
*  It's as thorough a public disqualification, a kind of dismissal, as I think I've ever [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=483.02s)]
*  seen in, I don't know, the 10 or 15 years I've ever watched a congressional hearing. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=491.58s)]
*  It's a senior member of one of these committees basically saying, I don't even know why you [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=496.46s)]
*  are in front of me. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=501.46s)]
*  It's a total takedown. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=503.5s)]
*  Mr. Hegseth, you are the ninth nominee for secretary of defense that I've had the honor [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=504.5s)]
*  to consider as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=508.9s)]
*  I have voted in favor of all your predecessors, including those in the first Trump administration. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=512.42s)]
*  Unfortunately, you lack the character and composure and competence to hold the position [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=517.74s)]
*  of secretary of defense. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=522.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=523.98s)]
*  And of course, Hegseth is sitting across from Senator Reed. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=524.98s)]
*  At this point, his jaw looks really tense. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=531.26s)]
*  And then suddenly, and I was watching this alongside of you, it's his turn to finally [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=534.88s)]
*  speak. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=539.3s)]
*  What is he saying? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=540.3s)]
*  Well, thank you, Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Reed, and all the members of this committee [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=541.3s)]
*  for this opportunity today. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=545.74s)]
*  Again, remember, this guy is a television personality. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=548.1800000000001s)]
*  So he's on now. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=551.02s)]
*  The light is on for him to speak. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=552.5s)]
*  And he starts off quite deliberately trying to disarm the senators. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=554.5s)]
*  Should I be confirmed, I look forward to working with this committee, senators from both parties, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=559.38s)]
*  to secure our nation. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=564.34s)]
*  He's saying this is going to be a hearing where he's looking out for the best of the [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=565.34s)]
*  nation. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=570.94s)]
*  He's going to work across the aisle as much as he can. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=571.94s)]
*  Thank you to my incredible wife, Jennifer, who has changed my life and been with me throughout [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=575.9s)]
*  this entire process. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=581.5s)]
*  He turns and he thanks his wife for her support, including our seven wonderful kids, Gunner, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=583.18s)]
*  Jackson. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=589.6999999999999s)]
*  He tries to name his seven kids, Luke, Rex. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=590.6999999999999s)]
*  Sorry, it's a lot of them. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=595.42s)]
*  And Gwendolyn. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=599.9399999999999s)]
*  Forgets one of the names, which draws kind of a laugh. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=600.9399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=602.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean, who among us? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=603.6999999999999s)]
*  Seven kids. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=604.6999999999999s)]
*  And then something dramatic happens inside the hearing room. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=606.5s)]
*  You are a misogynist. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=610.38s)]
*  Not only that, you are a... [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=612.58s)]
*  Hecklers start screaming in protest of Hexeth's nomination. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=614.82s)]
*  And the Capitol Police rush over and basically hustle this guy out. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=621.34s)]
*  I want to thank the authorities for their swift reaction to that outburst. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=626.1400000000001s)]
*  And Hexeth tries to get going again. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=633.1s)]
*  He tries to kind of regain his momentum with this. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=635.9399999999999s)]
*  ...meritocracy, war fighting, accountability and readiness. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=639.06s)]
*  And then another heckler jumps up and starts screaming at something else. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=647.78s)]
*  You may continue, sir. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=653.14s)]
*  So it's very disruptive initially. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=656.3s)]
*  The Department of Defense under Donald Trump will achieve peace through strength. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=658.88s)]
*  This is all at a time when, you know, Pete Hexeth is trying to talk about how he's going [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=665.04s)]
*  to transform the woke military that has sunk to new lows into this, you know, new department [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=669.64s)]
*  of warriors. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=675.68s)]
*  Unlike the current administration, politics should play no part in military matters. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=677.2s)]
*  We are not Republicans. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=683.6s)]
*  We are not Democrats. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=685.4s)]
*  We are American warriors. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=686.56s)]
*  Our standards will be high and they will be equal, not equitable. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=689.16s)]
*  That's a very different word. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=695.4799999999999s)]
*  And so how do you get that powerful military? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=698.5799999999999s)]
*  You do that by focusing on the mission of the military, the building up of military [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=702.2199999999999s)]
*  might and not being distracted by what Republicans say Democrats have spent too much time on, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=708.1999999999999s)]
*  of DEI policies and progressive politics and getting away from basic tenets of military [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=715.4s)]
*  effectiveness. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=724.0s)]
*  What if anything does Hexeth say in this opening statement about the questions that have come [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=725.44s)]
*  up around his resume? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=730.38s)]
*  Well, interestingly enough. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=732.2s)]
*  Now it is true and has been acknowledged that I don't have a similar biography to defense [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=734.76s)]
*  secretaries of the last 30 years. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=738.46s)]
*  You know, he openly acknowledges he's not your usual defense secretary. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=740.8s)]
*  But as President Trump also told me, we've repeatedly placed people atop the Pentagon [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=745.04s)]
*  with supposedly the right credentials, whether they are retired generals, academics or defense [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=749.64s)]
*  contractor executives. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=755.2s)]
*  And where has it gotten us? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=757.68s)]
*  He believes and I humbly agree that it's time to give someone with dust on his boots the [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=760.48s)]
*  helm, a change agent, someone with no... [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=765.72s)]
*  And that what he says is, you know, I'm bringing a new fresh approach to this. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=769.08s)]
*  Thank you for the time. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=776.1600000000001s)]
*  And I look forward to your questions. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=777.1600000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. Hexeth. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=779.2800000000001s)]
*  So by this point, the table has been set and we have the Republican chairman basically [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=780.5600000000001s)]
*  saying we're going to offer our complete undiluted unapologetic support for Hexeth as defense [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=787.72s)]
*  secretary. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=795.32s)]
*  The ranking Democrat is determined to try to disqualify him in the eyes of the public. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=796.94s)]
*  And Hexeth is proudly and pretty diplomatically and cleverly embracing the role of the change agent. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=804.1s)]
*  That's right. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=813.46s)]
*  And remember, this isn't just the introduction to this hearing. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=815.82s)]
*  The real fireworks are yet to come because the question and answer is that's going to [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=819.4200000000001s)]
*  go on for hours with Democrats and Republicans lining up. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=823.54s)]
*  The partisan lines have been thrown down on both sides. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=828.64s)]
*  And that's where the drama is really going to unfold in this hearing. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=832.06s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=841.9399999999999s)]
*  So, Eric, talk about the fireworks portion of this hearing, the questioning of Hexeth [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=842.94s)]
*  from senators of both parties. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=854.1s)]
*  So one of the big topics that came up, particularly from Democrats, who launched into Hexeth's [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=857.0600000000001s)]
*  comments and what he's written about women in the military. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=863.22s)]
*  In the weeks leading up to this hearing, he's tried to walk some of those comments back. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=869.18s)]
*  The Democrats haven't had a chance to really talk this thing through. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=873.8399999999999s)]
*  This is their first time to really confront him with what he's actually said and written [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=876.26s)]
*  on this. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=881.62s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Hexeth. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=882.62s)]
*  Good morning, Senator. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=884.62s)]
*  Jeanne Sahin, for instance, the Democratic senator from New Hampshire, was one of several [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=885.62s)]
*  female Democrat senators who took Hexeth on. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=891.6999999999999s)]
*  As recently as November the 7th of 2024 on the Sean Ryan show, you said, and I quote, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=895.06s)]
*  I'm straight up saying that we should not have women in combat roles. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=901.5799999999999s)]
*  It hasn't made us more effective. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=905.4599999999999s)]
*  And Sahin, among others, really launches in some really tough questioning. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=907.42s)]
*  Mr. Hexeth, should we take it to believe that you believe that the two women on this committee [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=911.7399999999999s)]
*  who have served honorably and with distinction made our military less effective and less [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=917.3399999999999s)]
*  capable? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=922.5799999999999s)]
*  This was something that other Democratic senators, including Kirsten Gillibrand of [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=923.9s)]
*  New York, also picked on. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=928.22s)]
*  We have hundreds, hundreds of women who are currently in the infantry, lethal members [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=929.98s)]
*  of our military serving in the infantry. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=936.68s)]
*  And basically saying, wait a minute here. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=939.3s)]
*  We already have women who are serving in the military and serving in some of these combat [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=942.0s)]
*  positions in the infantry and ground combat roles. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=947.64s)]
*  So please explain these types of statements because they're brutal and they're mean and [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=950.22s)]
*  they disrespect men and women who are willing to die for this country. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=955.94s)]
*  You will have to change how you see women to do this job well. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=960.34s)]
*  And I don't know if you are capable of that. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=964.26s)]
*  So I want to. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=966.1800000000001s)]
*  And then you've got other senators. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=967.1800000000001s)]
*  Senator Elizabeth Warren says, well, wait a minute. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=968.94s)]
*  You've had these kind of vague pronouncements of how women are so great in the military. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=971.14s)]
*  After your last public comment saying that women absolutely should not be in combat, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=978.02s)]
*  you declared that quote, some of our greatest warriors are women. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=982.98s)]
*  It seems like you've had this conversion and you're trying to sand the hard edges off your [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=989.54s)]
*  myriad public comments about this. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=994.86s)]
*  What extraordinary event happened in that 32 day period that made you change the core [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=997.54s)]
*  values you had expressed for the preceding 12 years? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1007.8199999999999s)]
*  In response to all this, Hegseth basically says, yes, ma'am, women in our military, as [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1013.78s)]
*  I have said publicly, have and continue to make amazing contributions across all aspects [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1020.4399999999999s)]
*  of our battlefield. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1027.02s)]
*  Women obviously play a very important role in the military, but he doesn't really address [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1028.66s)]
*  some of the most extreme things that he's written and said in the past. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1033.64s)]
*  But just saying when I'm talking about that issue, it's not about the capabilities of [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1037.9s)]
*  men and women. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1042.02s)]
*  It's about standards. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1043.02s)]
*  We have to have a standards based military. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1044.5s)]
*  Again, going back to his theme about focusing on the warrior ethos and not some of the DEI [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1047.42s)]
*  characteristics of the current administration. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1056.46s)]
*  Standards that we unfortunately over time have seen eroded in certain duty positions, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1059.02s)]
*  certain schools, certain places, which affects readiness, which is what I care about the [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1065.46s)]
*  most. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1069.78s)]
*  And what exactly does he mean when he's using that word standards? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1070.9s)]
*  It sounds like he is suggesting that during a democratic administration of Joe Biden, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1075.3s)]
*  that those standards got lowered. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1082.38s)]
*  He doesn't quite come out and say it, but is that what he's implying? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1085.1000000000001s)]
*  That's what he's implying. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1089.46s)]
*  He's basically saying that in order to accommodate, whether it's gender politics or other politics [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1090.46s)]
*  within the military, you've lowered the standards, the effectiveness standards of your basic [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1096.9s)]
*  soldiers here. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1101.6200000000001s)]
*  And that's just not the case. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1103.7s)]
*  The most elite units have got a specific test that both men and women who serve in those [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1105.3400000000001s)]
*  units have to pass. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1110.46s)]
*  It's not like there's a test for women and a test for men in these elite units. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1112.7s)]
*  And to say that the standards have been warped under the current administration to serve [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1116.38s)]
*  their progressive politics, that's not right. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1122.06s)]
*  And this is what some of these democratic senators are saying. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1125.54s)]
*  They're saying, wait a minute now. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1129.26s)]
*  They're calling him on it. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1131.18s)]
*  These are the requirements today for people serving in the industry, men and women. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1132.7s)]
*  They are gender neutral and they are very difficult to meet. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1137.66s)]
*  So that was the Democrats. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1141.46s)]
*  But what was perhaps the most interesting and one of the most awaited parts of this [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1143.98s)]
*  hearing was the support that Hexseth seemed to get from Republican Senator Joni Ernst. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1148.26s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Hexseth. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1156.38s)]
*  And thank you very much. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1157.38s)]
*  I appreciate your service to our nation. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1160.3s)]
*  He is a combat veteran and also a sexual assault survivor. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1163.74s)]
*  Somebody who is seen as a pivotal figure in these hearings. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1168.06s)]
*  You and I have had many productive conversations. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1172.58s)]
*  And just for our audience, we have had very frank conversations. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1178.54s)]
*  Is that correct, Mr. Hexseth? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1184.58s)]
*  Senator that is a correct characterization. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1186.82s)]
*  And she had seemed to be against his nomination in the beginning and then slowly began to [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1189.6599999999999s)]
*  express support for him after several meetings. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1195.4199999999998s)]
*  And so where we meet her on Tuesday is that she seems to be in his camp. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1199.26s)]
*  That's right. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1204.78s)]
*  I do believe in high standards where they do seem to kind of come together now is this [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1205.78s)]
*  question of standards for the young women that are out there now and can meet those [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1211.02s)]
*  standards. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1216.78s)]
*  They must physically be able to achieve those standards so that they can complete their [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1217.78s)]
*  mission. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1223.82s)]
*  Men and women must meet the same high standards. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1225.54s)]
*  They must be physically able to achieve those standards in order to serve in these units. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1228.7s)]
*  That of course is one of the main things that he's trying to get across. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1234.1s)]
*  And now she seems to be saying the same thing. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1237.8999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1240.46s)]
*  And that matters because she seems to be basically pushing back against these Democratic women [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1241.46s)]
*  senators and the case they're making. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1247.66s)]
*  That's right. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1251.06s)]
*  Republicans on the committee want to zero in on the whole question of standards and [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1252.3s)]
*  how the military should be based on merit and skill rather than DEI qualities. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1255.8999999999999s)]
*  For those watching at home, DEI is not about giving everybody opportunity. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1262.8999999999999s)]
*  It is rooted in cultural Marxism. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1267.86s)]
*  And not the wokeness that they claim is making America weak and making America's military [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1271.54s)]
*  weak. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1278.22s)]
*  The Secretary of the Air Force thought we had too many white officers, advocated for [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1279.26s)]
*  quotas. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1284.54s)]
*  And if you crunch the numbers, that meant that 5,800 white officers who've worked really [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1285.54s)]
*  hard should be fired. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1291.66s)]
*  Senators such as Senator Tuberville of Alabama talking about how the military is way too [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1294.34s)]
*  focused on identity issues. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1301.18s)]
*  I met with a general, a couple of generals this summer. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1304.3s)]
*  Coach, we're spending more money on transgender restrooms than we are coverings for $100 million [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1307.5s)]
*  airplanes. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1312.78s)]
*  That's not acceptable. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1313.78s)]
*  We can't do that. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1315.6999999999998s)]
*  This is why P. Hegseth has to be installed right away so that he can get to the job of [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1317.5s)]
*  focusing the nation's military on war fighting. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1323.1799999999998s)]
*  That's really what's important here. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1326.58s)]
*  I very much appreciate your focus on lethality in war fighting. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1328.6599999999999s)]
*  We desperately need it. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1333.58s)]
*  That is the focus that they have and which goes on for several senators. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1335.7s)]
*  Beyond these questions around gender and DEI, where else does this questioning go? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1341.6200000000001s)]
*  So another main area of questioning for the Democrats is just Mr. Hegseth's qualifications [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1349.1000000000001s)]
*  for the job. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1355.18s)]
*  And this is where Democrats really leaned in as if they were treating Hegseth to a job [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1356.78s)]
*  interview. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1362.94s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Hegseth. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1363.94s)]
*  Looking forward to this opportunity to talk. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1364.98s)]
*  I want to return to the... [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1367.26s)]
*  Senators, like Tim Kaine and Mark Kelly zero in on Hegseth's conduct. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1368.26s)]
*  They asked him about extramarital affairs that he has acknowledged he's had. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1374.74s)]
*  At that time you were still married to your second wife, correct? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1378.94s)]
*  I believe so. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1384.42s)]
*  And you had just fathered a child by a woman who would later become your third wife, correct? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1385.8600000000001s)]
*  They asked him about allegations of sexual assault. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1390.9s)]
*  Now, if it had been a sexual assault, that would be disqualifying to be Secretary of [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1394.02s)]
*  Defense, wouldn't it? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1398.06s)]
*  It was a false claim then and a false claim now. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1399.06s)]
*  If it had been a sexual assault, that would be disqualifying to be Secretary of Defense, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1402.34s)]
*  wouldn't it? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1408.1s)]
*  That was a false claim. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1409.1s)]
*  So you can't... [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1411.1s)]
*  Talking about a hypothetical. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1412.1s)]
*  So you can't... [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1413.1s)]
*  They asked him about reports of his excessive drinking. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1414.1s)]
*  At the Grand Hyatt at Washington, D.C., you were noticeably intoxicated and had to be [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1417.18s)]
*  carried up to your room. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1423.18s)]
*  Is that true or false? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1425.42s)]
*  Anonymous smears. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1427.26s)]
*  While in Louisiana, on official business for CVA, did you take your staff, including young [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1428.26s)]
*  female staff members, to a strip club? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1435.3400000000001s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1439.3400000000001s)]
*  Anonymous smears. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1440.3400000000001s)]
*  So... [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1441.3400000000001s)]
*  All of which is to say, you know, with this kind of background, you know, how in the world [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1442.3400000000001s)]
*  you know, endorse you as the head of the Defense Department. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1448.54s)]
*  We're hiring you to be the CEO of one of the most complex, largest organizations in the [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1454.22s)]
*  world. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1460.3s)]
*  And in fact, Gary Peters, one of the senators from Michigan, basically equated the Senate, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1461.3s)]
*  at least the committee here, as a board of directors. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1468.94s)]
*  And they're kind of grilling Hexeth on his limited job experiences. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1472.42s)]
*  What's the largest number of people you've ever supervised or had in an organization [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1476.86s)]
*  in your career? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1480.78s)]
*  Not three million. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1481.78s)]
*  No, I don't expect that. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1482.78s)]
*  No one, very few people have ever had that experience. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1484.1399999999999s)]
*  But how many? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1486.34s)]
*  It's a straight up question. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1487.34s)]
*  I think we had over 100 full-time staff at Concern Vets for America, roughly with thousands [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1488.34s)]
*  of volunteers. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1494.62s)]
*  So 100 people. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1495.62s)]
*  And Peters in particular says, you got to be kidding me. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1496.86s)]
*  I don't know of any corporate board of directors that would hire a CEO for a major company [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1500.4199999999998s)]
*  if they came and said, you know, I supervised 100 people before. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1506.2199999999998s)]
*  You wouldn't be hired as a CEO of one of the biggest companies in the country. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1510.02s)]
*  That's basically what the Pentagon is. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1515.02s)]
*  You're basically being hired as the CEO of the Defense Department. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1517.1s)]
*  Do you think that the way to raise the minimum standards of the people who serve us is to [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1520.5s)]
*  lower the standards for the Secretary of Defense, that we have someone who has never managed [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1525.62s)]
*  an organization more than 100 people is going to come in and manage this? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1531.3799999999999s)]
*  In response to all this, the Republicans kind of turned the idea of job qualifications [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1535.62s)]
*  inside out. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1539.6599999999999s)]
*  Mr. Hegg said that it seems to me that you've supervised far more people than the average [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1542.02s)]
*  United States Senator supervises typically. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1548.86s)]
*  You had Senator Wicker, the chairman, basically making a joke out of it saying, you know, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1554.3s)]
*  how many people do we supervise? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1559.34s)]
*  How many senators have showed up drunk to vote at night? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1561.22s)]
*  Then you have Senator Mullen of Oklahoma, who's basically saying, wait a minute, you [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1564.46s)]
*  know, who among us hasn't had a drink too many at work or had an affair? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1572.02s)]
*  You guys make sure you make a big show and point out the hypocrisy because the man's [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1576.78s)]
*  made a mistake. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1581.34s)]
*  And you want to sit there and say that he's not qualified? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1583.5s)]
*  Give me a joke. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1586.54s)]
*  Another Republican senator, a new senator, Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL, also weighed [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1588.9s)]
*  in on this. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1592.8600000000001s)]
*  How many rounds of 5.56 can you fit into the magazine of an M4 rifle? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1594.3200000000002s)]
*  Depends on the magazine, but standard issues 30, Senator. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1599.22s)]
*  And what size round is the M9 Beretta standard issue sidearm for the military fire? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1603.92s)]
*  A 9 millimeter, Senator. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1608.74s)]
*  Basically making the case that Hexseth has the experience that matters most. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1610.8200000000002s)]
*  And he goes on to grill him about what kind of ammunition goes in certain kind of rifles [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1616.1399999999999s)]
*  and what tactics would you use in certain situations? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1621.4399999999998s)]
*  And Hexseth answers them all like kind of rapid fire and he seems to get the answers [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1624.8999999999999s)]
*  right. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1628.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, he talks about what kind of batteries and night vision goggles. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1629.9399999999998s)]
*  And it's just, it's kind of like, this is what real warriors care about, not this other [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1633.06s)]
*  stuff. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1638.1799999999998s)]
*  Let's get on with what's really important here, the Republicans seem to be saying. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1639.1799999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1643.46s)]
*  And by the end, it's very interesting. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1644.6200000000001s)]
*  Democrats have basically been saying, you're not technically qualified to run the Department [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1646.26s)]
*  of Defense in the way that we think about previous Secretaries of Defense, and therefore [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1650.26s)]
*  the DOD under you will be a mess. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1656.7s)]
*  And Republicans are saying, no, actually, because he has the right kind of experience [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1658.76s)]
*  and because he's going to root out, you know, what they would describe as kind of woke DEI [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1665.7s)]
*  culture in the military. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1670.1s)]
*  He's actually going to save the Department of Defense from the current mess. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1672.82s)]
*  As they say, they're both kind of talking right past each other, the Democrats and Republicans. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1679.1s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1684.4599999999998s)]
*  And along the way, you know, Democrats just seem completely unconvinced by any of this [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1685.4599999999998s)]
*  approach. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1690.54s)]
*  Democrats are underlined. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1692.34s)]
*  This guy is just a yes man for the president. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1693.34s)]
*  He will do anything. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1695.4599999999998s)]
*  He is so loyal to the president. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1696.4599999999998s)]
*  He could even violate human rights or other laws or other, you know, other norms and conventions [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1698.3s)]
*  to satisfy him. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1703.86s)]
*  Mr. Hessek, welcome to the committee. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1705.4199999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Senator. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1707.5s)]
*  You've made several references. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1708.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1709.5s)]
*  And there's this interesting exchange that Hexth has with Senator Angus King of Maine. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1710.5s)]
*  You wrote in your book just last year, if we're going to send our boys to fight, and [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1714.5s)]
*  it should be boys, we need to unleash them to win. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1719.26s)]
*  Where he talks about the rules of war and the law of armed conflict and what U.S. soldiers [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1723.22s)]
*  shouldn't be having to do. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1729.7s)]
*  We fight enemies also, Senator, as our generation understands, that play by no rules. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1732.7s)]
*  They use civilians as human shields. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1738.34s)]
*  So are you saying that the Geneva Convention should not be observed? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1740.5s)]
*  We follow rules, but we don't need burdensome rules of engagement that make it impossible [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1745.8600000000001s)]
*  for us to win these wars. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1749.9s)]
*  It gets to Hexth as a guy who used to be on the ground in these wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1752.46s)]
*  the suspicion of higher officials, including perhaps some lawyers, who put restrictions [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1758.1000000000001s)]
*  on the soldiers who are going after bad guys, in Hexth's view. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1765.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1768.74s)]
*  We are a country that fights by the rule of law, and our men and women always do. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1769.74s)]
*  And yet we have too many people here in air-conditioned offices that like to point fingers at the [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1773.96s)]
*  guys in dark and dangerous places. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1779.82s)]
*  The gals in helicopters in enemy territory who are doing things that people in Washington, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1781.7s)]
*  D.C. would never dare to do. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1786.3400000000001s)]
*  Or send... [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1788.38s)]
*  Eric, what was so surprising about that is that here you have a nominee to run the military [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1789.38s)]
*  saying that in his mind, there are moments where soldiers perhaps don't need to follow [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1793.94s)]
*  the chain of command, which is a weird message to send when you want to be the head of the [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1800.18s)]
*  military. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1805.74s)]
*  It may not mean to follow, not follow, but at least to challenge, to challenge the higher [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1807.46s)]
*  authority. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1812.06s)]
*  And again, that puts Hexth back in where he's been and where he's most comfortable. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1813.06s)]
*  He's the grunt. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1816.6200000000001s)]
*  He's an officer who is on the ground in the fight. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1817.6200000000001s)]
*  He's certainly indicating challenging a chain of command or higher authorities that don't [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1823.1s)]
*  have these priorities in mind that he does. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1828.9s)]
*  This is just another moment where Hexth is kind of showing he's going to be a very unconventional [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1834.06s)]
*  defense secretary going back. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1839.78s)]
*  He's going to be a disruptor, just like his boss. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1842.4199999999998s)]
*  This concludes today's hearing. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1846.82s)]
*  I want to thank the witnesses for and their families. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1848.3s)]
*  And this hearing is adjourned. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1853.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1855.46s)]
*  Eric, by the end of the hearing, it very much felt like every Democrat in that room was [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1857.46s)]
*  signaling that they will be opposing Hexth. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1864.02s)]
*  And my sense is that all the Republicans on that committee are going to be voting for [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1867.1399999999999s)]
*  Hexth. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1870.66s)]
*  And so he will be recommended by this committee. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1872.1399999999999s)]
*  And if we assume that the same scenario plays out in the full Senate, then Hexth most likely [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1874.2s)]
*  becomes the next secretary of defense. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1879.48s)]
*  And it would seem like there's some risk here, especially for the Democrats in the Senate, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1882.42s)]
*  that whether they mean to or not, in their opposition to Hexth, they're kind of reinforcing [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1890.54s)]
*  the message of the election itself, which is that Trump is the candidate of government [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1899.5s)]
*  disruption, which the majority of Americans voted for, and Democrats are the party that [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1905.34s)]
*  guards the status quo. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1913.3s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1917.1s)]
*  I think you're right, Michael, that this election was about change and was about disruption. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1918.74s)]
*  I think the Democrats have had to pick and choose which of these key cabinet offices [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1923.6999999999998s)]
*  they're going to challenge. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1929.62s)]
*  On some, such as at secretary of state, they're going to go along with this most likely. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1931.5s)]
*  But they've drawn the line at the Pentagon, at least for now. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1935.86s)]
*  But they just think he is the wrong guy at the wrong time at this place. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1939.4199999999998s)]
*  In this case, they seem fine with the risk that they're going against the trend of disruption. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1946.02s)]
*  The Pentagon is too important, too important an institution to put in the hands of such [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1952.22s)]
*  an inexperienced and unfit candidate in their view. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1958.98s)]
*  Well, Eric, thank you very much. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1963.74s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1967.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1969.3s)]
*  On Tuesday night, Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, whose vote is considered decisive for Hegseth's [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1971.38s)]
*  confirmation, said that she would support his nomination, all but assuring that he will [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1980.42s)]
*  become the next secretary of defense. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1987.14s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1993.38s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=1996.38s)]
*  Officials in California now say it may take weeks or longer to fully extinguish the largest [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=2002.5400000000002s)]
*  of the wildfires that have ravaged greater Los Angeles. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=2008.8200000000002s)]
*  On Tuesday, heavy winds ignited several new fires, but many of them were quickly brought [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=2013.1000000000001s)]
*  under control. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=2019.5800000000002s)]
*  And U.S. securities regulators have sued Elon Musk in federal court over his conduct in [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=2022.38s)]
*  purchasing Twitter. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=2029.18s)]
*  According to regulators, Musk violated securities laws in 2022 by amassing a large stake in [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=2031.18s)]
*  the social media company without filing the required notification. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=2038.5s)]
*  But because of Musk's close relationship with President-elect Trump, it's likely that [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=2044.2600000000002s)]
*  the incoming administration may seek to drop the lawsuit. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eaggDuKTFc&t=2049.66s)]
