Video Description: During their first few days in power, the Republican-controlled House and Senate vowed to put aside their furious intraparty battles to make Donald J. Trump’s sweeping agenda the law of the land.


Catie Edmonson, a congressional correspondent for The New York Times, discusses how likely that actually is.


Guest: Catie Edmondson (https://www.nytimes.com/by/catie-edmondson) , a congressional correspondent for The New York Times


Background reading: 

  •  Vice President Kamala D. Harris presided over the certification of her own loss (https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/us/politics/congress-trump-election-certification.html)  without disputing it, and Democrats made no move to challenge the results.
  •  Speaker Mike Johnson narrowly avoided a painful and prolonged fight to keep his post, but his messy victory showed how difficult his job will be. (https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/03/us/politics/johnson-speaker-trump-republicans.html)

# Republicans Take Control of Congress — and Harris Certifies Her Own Loss
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=4.24s)]
*  Today. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=10.08s)]
*  During its first few days in power, the Republican-controlled House and Senate have vowed to put aside their [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=13.86s)]
*  furious intra-party battles to make Donald Trump's sweeping agenda the law of the land. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=21.84s)]
*  I spoke with my colleague, Katie Edmondson, about how likely that actually is. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=31.0s)]
*  It's Tuesday, January 7th. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=45.12s)]
*  So Katie, take us, if you would, inside the House chamber on Monday afternoon for this [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=54.16s)]
*  pretty momentous ceremony. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=59.12s)]
*  Well, I think today's ceremony really underscored what is supposed to be the pro forma nature [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=61.12s)]
*  of the January 6th congressional counting of electoral votes. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=66.82s)]
*  This is a performative ritual in which Congress counts the electoral votes from each state [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=72.8s)]
*  and certifies the election of whoever won the presidency. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=78.96s)]
*  Obviously, if your first introduction to this ceremony was four years ago, you had a very [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=83.39999999999999s)]
*  different view of what happened on that day. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=90.24s)]
*  And so today's counting of electoral votes really was what was supposed to happen. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=95.12s)]
*  The House come to order. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=103.32s)]
*  The Senate and House of Representatives are meeting in joint session to verify the certificates [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=108.52s)]
*  and count the votes of the electors of the several states for president and vice president [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=115.0s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=122.16s)]
*  You had Vice President Kamala Harris overseeing the entire ceremony, overseeing essentially [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=123.72s)]
*  Congress certifying her own loss. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=130.48s)]
*  The certificate of the electoral vote of the state of Maryland seems to be regular in form [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=133.32s)]
*  and authentic. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=138.8s)]
*  And it appears there from the Kamala D. Harris of the state of California received 10 votes [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=139.8s)]
*  for president and Tim Walz of the state of Minnesota received 10 votes for vice president. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=146.6s)]
*  And you had a pretty stark scene, I think, in which she's standing there sort of staring [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=154.2s)]
*  straight ahead as one by one lawmakers stand up and they are announcing the states that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=159.2s)]
*  she won as a presidential candidate, but they're also announcing the states that she lost. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=164.72s)]
*  The certificate of the electoral vote of the state of Michigan. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=169.96s)]
*  The certificate of the electoral vote of the state of Nevada. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=173.84s)]
*  The certificate of the electoral vote of the great state of Wisconsin seems to be regular [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=177.76s)]
*  in form and authentic. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=181.72s)]
*  And it appears there from the Donald J. Trump of the state of Florida received 10 votes [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=183.28s)]
*  for president and JD Vance of the state of Ohio received 10 votes for vice president. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=188.04s)]
*  And so as we go through the roll call of states, not only are we reliving sort of the calls [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=193.92s)]
*  on election night, but Harris is reliving it too. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=198.88s)]
*  The votes for president of the United States are as follows. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=201.84s)]
*  Donald J. Trump of the state of Florida has received 312 votes. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=205.76s)]
*  Kamala D. Harris of the state of California has received 226 votes. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=211.72s)]
*  And at the end of this entire process, it falls to her to be the one to say that Trump [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=222.12s)]
*  was the candidate who won the electoral votes to win the presidency. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=227.32s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  It's all very respectful and it's the peaceful transfer of power. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=236.24s)]
*  An action to your point earlier, a restoration of what is supposed to be a routine. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=241.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=247.12s)]
*  I think lawmakers were largely pretty relieved to see that they were able to all come together [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=249.0s)]
*  here, complete their ceremony without any major events. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  But I also think at the same time, you'd be kidding yourself if you pointed to this particular [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=258.62s)]
*  vote and said, well, Congress is going to be a pretty drama free institution, a pretty [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=263.21999999999997s)]
*  united institution moving forward. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=268.64000000000004s)]
*  When in fact, you only have to look back to the vote that played out on the House floor [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=271.0s)]
*  on Friday with the reelection of Mike Johnson to the speakership to see if there are some [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=275.56s)]
*  pretty raw divisions within the House Republican Conference that are likely going to animate [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=281.54s)]
*  this Congress moving forward. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=286.76s)]
*  Well talk us through that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  What exactly happened last Friday? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, really, Michael, this is the continuation of the story that you and I have talked about [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  for so long now, which is that there is this group of ultra conservative, anti-spending [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=298.48s)]
*  fiscal hawks in the House Republican Conference who feel that they have been again and again [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=305.76s)]
*  let down by House Republican leadership when it comes to matters of government spending. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=311.6s)]
*  These are the guys who voted to oust Kevin McCarthy when he was speaker. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=317.0s)]
*  And this time when it came to the reelection of Speaker Mike Johnson, they decided to play [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=321.8s)]
*  the role of the thorn in his side yet again. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=326.68s)]
*  And why exactly did they choose to fight this speaker's reelection given, and Katie, I think [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=329.76000000000005s)]
*  it was you who said this to me in one of those many conversations about this group of hard [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=336.6s)]
*  right fiscal conservatives, Johnson was for a long time considered a kind of kindred spirit [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=340.44s)]
*  to these House conservative Republicans and someone whose strong relationship with them [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=346.08000000000004s)]
*  would insulate him from this kind of rebellion. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  So on paper, it should have been a glide path for Johnson. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=354.84s)]
*  But these ultra conservatives for months now have been nursing the same grievance against [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=357.96s)]
*  Johnson that they had against McCarthy, which is that when it comes to keeping the government [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=362.4s)]
*  open, avoiding a shutdown, passing these massive spending bills, both Johnson and McCarthy [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=368.23999999999995s)]
*  routinely relied on Democratic votes to keep spending levels flat. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=374.67999999999995s)]
*  And it is something that has just infuriated these hard right Republicans. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=379.67999999999995s)]
*  The other factor that was working against Johnson here is that he has an extraordinarily [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=384.68s)]
*  thin margin in the House. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=389.8s)]
*  So in order to win the speakership on Friday, he was able to lose just one Republican. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=392.56s)]
*  And we knew going into the vote that in fact he already had lost at least one Republican. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  We knew that Congressman Thomas Massey of Kentucky was going to vote against him. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=404.16s)]
*  For all the fiscal reasons we've been discussing. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=409.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=411.4s)]
*  That meant that he could not afford to lose anyone else on the House floor during that [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=412.47999999999996s)]
*  vote. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=416.88s)]
*  And we got our first sort of inkling that there was going to be real trouble for him [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=420.03999999999996s)]
*  on this first ballot early on. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=424.84s)]
*  The next order of business is the election of the Speaker of the House of Representatives [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=428.03999999999996s)]
*  for the 119th Congress. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=432.67999999999995s)]
*  The reading clerk will now call the roll. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=435.67999999999995s)]
*  Adams. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=438.47999999999996s)]
*  There are a number of Freedom Caucus members whose last names start with B or C, which [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=440.92s)]
*  is relevant only insofar as the roll call is called alphabetically. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=447.08000000000004s)]
*  And so lo and behold, we get to Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=452.08000000000004s)]
*  His name is called out. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=458.52000000000004s)]
*  And he doesn't respond. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=460.68s)]
*  Silence. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=462.68s)]
*  Silence. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=463.68s)]
*  Silence. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=465.68s)]
*  And Michael, I have to say, sometimes lawmakers are not necessarily the most focused on the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=466.68s)]
*  floor. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=471.24s)]
*  Sometimes they're hard of hearing. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=472.24s)]
*  And so the first time his name is called and there's silence, you're thinking maybe there's [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=474.40000000000003s)]
*  a mistake, maybe he's running late. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=478.68s)]
*  But we saw him standing on the center aisle of the House floor. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=481.4s)]
*  Biggs of Arizona. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=484.88s)]
*  His name was called again. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=487.56s)]
*  He was staring just sort of defiantly straight in space. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=491.64s)]
*  Biggs of South Carolina. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=496.56s)]
*  Johnson. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=499.56s)]
*  And they moved on. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=502.76s)]
*  Cloud. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=503.76s)]
*  Cloud. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=504.76s)]
*  And we saw that happen several more times throughout the roll call. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=507.04s)]
*  Clyde. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=512.04s)]
*  Clyde. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=514.04s)]
*  And it became extraordinarily clear, especially given which lawmakers were refusing to answer, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=516.68s)]
*  that this was a concerted effort to deprive Johnson of the votes he needed to become speaker [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=522.28s)]
*  and basically to put a stick in his eye. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=528.3599999999999s)]
*  And his predicament gets worse as you go down the roll call, because not only has Thomas [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=531.2399999999999s)]
*  Massey voted against him, voted for another Republican lawmaker, but... [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=536.28s)]
*  Norman. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=541.3599999999999s)]
*  Jordan. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=542.3599999999999s)]
*  Jordan. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=543.3599999999999s)]
*  Self. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=544.3599999999999s)]
*  Donald. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=546.04s)]
*  Donald. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=547.04s)]
*  Two other Republicans cast their votes for other lawmakers as well. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=548.04s)]
*  So now you had six lawmakers refusing to answer in protest and three Republicans voting against [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=552.72s)]
*  him outright. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=559.12s)]
*  Johnson this whole time was sitting very stoically in his seat on the House floor, but before [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=561.48s)]
*  they even I think got to the last set of names on the roll call, he was out of his seat and [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=566.48s)]
*  he was over talking to some of these defectors. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=571.8000000000001s)]
*  And that set off a very familiar scene on the House floor, which was the Republican [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=579.0400000000001s)]
*  leader haggling and negotiating in real time with these holdouts for their votes to win [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=584.52s)]
*  the gavel. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=589.96s)]
*  Right, because at this moment he has lost reelection or he's not won it. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=590.96s)]
*  Well, it looks like he's going to lose reelection. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=596.0s)]
*  And not only that, if the vote had been called with those lawmakers casting their votes or [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=598.8s)]
*  refusing to vote, it looked as if the gavel could fall into Hakeem Jeffrey's hands, the [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=604.56s)]
*  Democratic leader, because the person who wins the speakership is the person who wins [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=610.7199999999999s)]
*  the most votes. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=614.4799999999999s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=615.4799999999999s)]
*  So this was going to be a huge problem for not only Mike Johnson personally, but potentially [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=616.4799999999999s)]
*  Republicans at large. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=620.64s)]
*  So Mike Johnson is negotiating, he's talking with these lawmakers, and we see those six [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=622.96s)]
*  lawmakers who refuse to vote suddenly change their votes and cast them for Johnson. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=629.6s)]
*  Okay, so where does that math leave Mike Johnson? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=635.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, he still has a big problem on his hands because again, he can only lose one Republican. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=638.32s)]
*  And at this point in time, there are three Republicans voting against him. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=644.1600000000001s)]
*  Now his allies always saw Thomas Massey, the congressman from Kentucky, as being immovable, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=648.92s)]
*  someone they were not going to be able to flip. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=655.68s)]
*  And so Johnson's focus turns to the two other holdouts, Keith Self of Texas and Ralph Norman [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=658.04s)]
*  of South Carolina. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=663.88s)]
*  And he'd been talking with them on the House floor, but he kind of whisks them off the [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=665.9599999999999s)]
*  House floor into this ante room. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=669.68s)]
*  And that's when Congresswoman Nancy Mace of South Carolina intervenes and who does she [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=672.4399999999999s)]
*  have on the phone but President Trump. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=677.76s)]
*  He apparently was in the middle of a golf game down in Florida. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=681.72s)]
*  And he spoke with Johnson, Norman and Self all on speakerphone in this ante room. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=686.52s)]
*  And we know what his message was, because Ralph Norman and Keith Self told us afterwards. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=693.36s)]
*  His message was, look, Mike is the only guy who has the votes to become speaker, right? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=699.36s)]
*  You need to do this for me. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=705.0400000000001s)]
*  We need to get on with it, right? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=707.12s)]
*  We have a trifecta. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=708.88s)]
*  This type of opportunity is a rare one. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=710.0400000000001s)]
*  We need to seize it. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=712.0400000000001s)]
*  We need to get going. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=713.0400000000001s)]
*  And it sounds like neither man really pushed back much on this. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=714.9200000000001s)]
*  Ralph Norman told us that his response to Trump was, well, you know, we just want to [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=718.8000000000001s)]
*  make sure that Mike is the person who's going to get everything that you want. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=722.48s)]
*  We want to make sure you get your deal. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=726.6800000000001s)]
*  And that's really where our trepidations are. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=728.4000000000001s)]
*  But the House will be in order. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=730.9200000000001s)]
*  By the end of the call, Keith Self and Ralph Norman walked back out onto the House floor. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=733.36s)]
*  Mr. Norman Johnson, Mr. Self Johnson. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=738.8000000000001s)]
*  And they changed their votes. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=745.44s)]
*  Therefore, the Honorable Mike Johnson of the state of Louisiana, having received a majority [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=746.88s)]
*  of the votes cast, is duly elected speaker of the House of Representatives for the 119th [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=751.88s)]
*  Congress. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=757.96s)]
*  And so Johnson was able to successfully win the speakership on that first ballot. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=759.96s)]
*  But minutes after Johnson is officially reelected, the House Freedom Caucus, which is sort of [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=767.48s)]
*  the organizing organ for a lot of these guys, it's that ultra conservative block of lawmakers, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=772.6800000000001s)]
*  they sent him a public letter. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=778.5600000000001s)]
*  And it begins, today, we voted for Mike Johnson for speaker of the House because of our steadfast [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=781.32s)]
*  support of President Trump. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=787.36s)]
*  We did this despite our sincere reservations regarding the speaker's track record over [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=789.6800000000001s)]
*  the past 15 months. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=794.32s)]
*  Translation, we voted for you, but we don't really trust you. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=795.96s)]
*  And we did it for Trump. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=800.04s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=801.5600000000001s)]
*  And to send this minutes after he wins re-election, after they subjected him to this kind of embarrassing [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=802.5600000000001s)]
*  spectacle on the House floor, right, is really to assert their own power and to say, you [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=809.96s)]
*  need to listen to us. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=816.36s)]
*  Katie, how do you understand what played out here? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=818.16s)]
*  These House Republicans basically saying they're going to do this for Trump when Trump [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=820.2s)]
*  himself is somebody who has, when he was president, raised the national debt by trillions and [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=824.72s)]
*  trillions of dollars, which very much seems at odds with what these House fiscal conservatives [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=831.24s)]
*  say they care about. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=836.4s)]
*  It almost feels like they're holding a lot of what's happened in the last few years [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=837.92s)]
*  against Johnson rather than Trump, when on top of all that, Trump is pledging to do things [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=843.52s)]
*  as president that would further increase the national debt. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=849.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think we got a preview of a lot of potential collisions to come in this [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=853.48s)]
*  Congress, both in this vote and in the past couple of weeks, right? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=859.3199999999999s)]
*  In this letter that the House Freedom Caucus sent to Johnson, they enumerated a list of [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=864.36s)]
*  demands, and these demands are going to be incredibly hard for Johnson to act on. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=870.36s)]
*  One of them is that they can't raise the debt limit, which is something that President Trump [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=878.24s)]
*  has requested lawmakers do without enacting deep spending cuts that would offset their [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=882.2s)]
*  increases to the nation's borrowing limit. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=888.64s)]
*  Another one is that if you're going to implement a program as costly as mass deportations, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=892.12s)]
*  then you need to cut other government programs somewhere else. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=897.48s)]
*  And so what you have essentially is these lawmakers saying that they want to enact Trump's [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=901.6s)]
*  agenda, but they want to do so in a way that is going to be almost impossible to push through [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=907.96s)]
*  the House when it comes to achieving these types of fiscal goals. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=914.04s)]
*  And so I think that's partly why they're looking to Mike Johnson. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=917.8s)]
*  Congress, of course, has the power of the purse. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=921.8s)]
*  I think they're looking for him to come up with some of those answers, to fill in some of the [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=923.84s)]
*  blanks here. But I also think it's just a fact that they inherently understand that Trump [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=928.1600000000001s)]
*  himself doesn't really have these same concerns about fiscal responsibility that they [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=933.52s)]
*  themselves share. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=938.44s)]
*  So ultimately, they take out their frustration at Mike Johnson, at the speaker, because he's [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=940.0s)]
*  ultimately responsible for federal spending. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=943.72s)]
*  So it makes a certain sense. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=947.8000000000001s)]
*  I think that's right. And look, I think more cynically, you also just have to face the [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=949.6800000000001s)]
*  reality that he is a politically safer target to vent frustrations at than Trump is. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=953.52s)]
*  So what does all of this add up to when we think about how Republican control of the [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=960.52s)]
*  House is going to work with Donald Trump as president and Mike Johnson as speaker? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=966.28s)]
*  Well, I think the entire exercise that we went through on Friday was really conservatives [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=972.88s)]
*  putting Mike Johnson and his leadership on notice. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=978.52s)]
*  Right. The idea that he really is going to have to answer to them. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=982.4399999999999s)]
*  He is going to have to be responsive to their demands. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=986.92s)]
*  And I think, look, you could say, hasn't that been true for the entire last year of Mike [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=990.12s)]
*  Johnson's speakership? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=994.68s)]
*  How is this any different? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=996.28s)]
*  But the difference here, I think, are the expectations. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=998.0s)]
*  Republicans are starting this year thinking we have a real opportunity here. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1001.4399999999999s)]
*  We just won big. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1005.52s)]
*  We won the House. We won the Senate. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1007.1999999999999s)]
*  We won the White House. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1009.3199999999999s)]
*  This is our time to deliver for our voters, for our constituents. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1010.7600000000001s)]
*  And so there's a lot of pressure on Mike Johnson to deliver. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1014.5600000000001s)]
*  Or else. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1018.6400000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's the fundamental message here. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1021.08s)]
*  If he doesn't deliver for especially these conservative fiscal House Republicans, they [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1022.8800000000001s)]
*  may decide one day to wake up and toss them out. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1029.68s)]
*  Yes, that is the message. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1034.24s)]
*  That is the sort of Damocles they want hovering over his head. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1035.8s)]
*  They want him to know that he is on thin ice. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1039.6s)]
*  And I think what's striking about that is it's shaping up to be a very different [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1043.6s)]
*  environment than what we're seeing over on the other side of the Capitol, where [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1047.24s)]
*  Republicans also have a majority in the United States Senate. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1051.1200000000001s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1066.6s)]
*  So, Katie, describe the dynamic now at play over in the Senate side of the U.S. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1070.08s)]
*  Capitol under Republican control. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1074.88s)]
*  Well, while all of this drama was playing out in the House on Friday, things were much [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1077.24s)]
*  calmer over in the Senate. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1082.68s)]
*  We saw the newly elected senators get sworn in. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1084.68s)]
*  But probably the biggest change was that Mitch McConnell is no longer the Republican [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1087.56s)]
*  leader. And that's for the first time in about two decades. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1092.8s)]
*  Instead, we have a new leader helming the Republican conference, and that is Senator [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1097.28s)]
*  John Thune of South Dakota. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1101.28s)]
*  And what's the story of his selection, his rather undramatic selection compared to [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1103.2s)]
*  Mike Johnson's as Senate Majority Leader? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1108.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, it was an election that was lacking in drama, but that wasn't necessarily a [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1111.3600000000001s)]
*  foregone conclusion. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1115.24s)]
*  So back in November, when it became clear that Republicans had won control of the [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1117.08s)]
*  Senate, there was, I would say, a clutch of MAGA conservatives who said, look, if [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1122.12s)]
*  we're going to have this governing trifecta, why don't we make sure that we have a [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1128.3999999999999s)]
*  true MAGA loyalist leading Senate Republicans? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1133.04s)]
*  Because they felt that they had been somewhat smothered by the leadership of Mitch [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1137.32s)]
*  McConnell, who did much to enable Trump, but also was quite critical of him at times. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1141.7199999999998s)]
*  Right. And this is where Senator Rick Scott of Florida threw his hat in the ring [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1147.76s)]
*  to challenge John Thune to lead the Senate Republican conference. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1152.1599999999999s)]
*  And we should think of Rick Scott as being that MAGA style candidate. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1156.3999999999999s)]
*  That's right. Now, one incredibly important difference between how the House elects the [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1160.84s)]
*  Speaker and how senators elect their party leader is that the Senate does it by secret [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1166.32s)]
*  ballot. And by the time the first round of ballots were cast, it was clear that Rick [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1172.8799999999999s)]
*  Scott was not going to have the votes to lead the Republican conference at all. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1177.3999999999999s)]
*  Worth pointing out, as I think you're essentially doing, that the secret ballot means [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1182.12s)]
*  that a senator never really has to tell anybody, including potentially angry MAGA [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1187.12s)]
*  supporting constituents, what they did in that vote. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1192.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's absolutely right. It gives them this insulation of plausible deniability [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1196.04s)]
*  that members over in the House certainly do not have. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1200.76s)]
*  And I think that helped Thune get over the finish line here. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1203.6s)]
*  But I think a lot of these Republican senators saw Thune as an institutionalist. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1206.8000000000002s)]
*  He actually served as McConnell's deputy. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1212.24s)]
*  He was McConnell's number two. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1214.72s)]
*  He absorbed a lot of the responsibilities that McConnell kind of had to relinquish as [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1216.6000000000001s)]
*  he was dealing with health problems in the last year. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1221.1200000000001s)]
*  And I think they also saw him as someone who wanted to guard the Senate's independence [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1224.44s)]
*  as an institution in a way that Rick Scott was certainly not campaigning on. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1229.76s)]
*  Well, just explain that. How should we think of Thune and what is his relationship to [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1234.76s)]
*  Donald Trump? You've made it clear that he was not the MAGA candidate. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1240.48s)]
*  What is he exactly? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1243.96s)]
*  Well, I think it might be best explained in his own words. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1246.0400000000002s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader Thune, welcome back to Meet the Press. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1249.2s)]
*  Thanks, Kristen. Great to be with you. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1251.8400000000001s)]
*  He actually went on to a Sunday show a couple of days ago and was asked, how would you [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1253.0s)]
*  describe your relationship with President-elect Trump right now? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1256.2s)]
*  What's your relationship like with Donald Trump? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1258.96s)]
*  And his response was, well, you know what? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1261.5600000000002s)]
*  We are. It's evolving. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1263.92s)]
*  It's evolving. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1266.28s)]
*  I think kind of tells you all you need to know. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1268.6000000000001s)]
*  Where has it evolved from and what is it evolving into? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1270.64s)]
*  Well, Trump himself actually once accused John Thune of being a rhino, a Republican [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1274.92s)]
*  in name only, which is one of sort of the worst political slurs that can be bandied [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1280.48s)]
*  about within the Republican Party. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1285.6000000000001s)]
*  And what earned him that moniker, that slur rhino from Trump? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1287.48s)]
*  Well, that is because John Thune not only did not support Trump's effort to challenge [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1291.92s)]
*  the 2020 election results, but he also was quite publicly skeptical of that effort to [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1298.76s)]
*  overturn Biden's electoral victory. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1305.56s)]
*  I actually remember very distinctly a reporter asking Thune in the halls of the Capitol, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1308.24s)]
*  leading up to January 6th, 2021, asking him, John Thune, what do you think about [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1314.08s)]
*  Donald Trump's effort to overturn the election here? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1319.4s)]
*  And Thune's answer was, I think it's going to go down like a shot dog, which Trump did [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1322.76s)]
*  not take kindly to. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1328.2s)]
*  But four years later. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1330.2s)]
*  I think when it comes to the big issues, securing the border, rebuilding the military, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1331.76s)]
*  strengthening the economy, generating energy dominance for this country, those are all [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1335.88s)]
*  things on which we agree. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1340.5600000000002s)]
*  Thune himself explicitly says a number of the major agenda items that Trump has coming [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1342.1200000000001s)]
*  into the White House are ones that he believes in. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1348.56s)]
*  The things that he talked about on the campaign trail, the things that the American people [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1350.6799999999998s)]
*  voted for are all things that I think this president wants to get done. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1353.8s)]
*  We want to get done. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1358.6s)]
*  And I say that our incentives are aligned. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1359.44s)]
*  That his incentives and Trump's incentives are aligned. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1361.6799999999998s)]
*  At the same time, he is certainly not a MAGA loyalist in the vein of Rick Scott. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1365.1599999999999s)]
*  And I do think one of the reasons why Republican senators ultimately voted to have him [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1370.72s)]
*  lead their conference was because they are looking for a leader who is willing to assert [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1376.6s)]
*  a little bit more independence. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1381.48s)]
*  And they thought he would provide some sort of level of protection for the Senate as an [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1383.48s)]
*  institution at a time when Trump has strongly suggested he wants to co-opt that [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1389.2s)]
*  independence for his own agenda. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1395.36s)]
*  Right. I guess the question is just how much or just how little? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1397.44s)]
*  That's right. That is going to be the question of this Congress. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1401.08s)]
*  So, Katie, let's bring all of this together now as we consider how this Congress is likely [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1404.44s)]
*  to operate over the next few weeks, next few months, next basically two years until there's [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1409.8s)]
*  a midterm election and things might change. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1414.28s)]
*  What underlies the drama in the House, as you explained, is the fact that they have a [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1416.8s)]
*  very small razor thin majority that allows these fiscal conservatives to exert a lot of [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1421.68s)]
*  power when they want to. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1427.3999999999999s)]
*  They can simply withhold their support for either Johnson or any Republican bill. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1428.8799999999999s)]
*  The reality is that the same situation basically holds true in the Senate, right? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1433.3600000000001s)]
*  There are just a few Senate Republicans who could block anything, whether it's a [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1437.8000000000002s)]
*  confirmation or a spending bill or an immigration bill. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1442.5200000000002s)]
*  So is this a Republican controlled House and Senate that's actually practically capable [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1445.8000000000002s)]
*  of getting Trump's agenda passed? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1453.48s)]
*  I mean, it's going to be really tough. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1456.68s)]
*  Now we have a blueprint of what they hope their major legislative accomplishment is [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1458.52s)]
*  going to be. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1465.04s)]
*  What's that? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1465.76s)]
*  So Republicans right now are talking about shoehorning in a number of their priorities, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1466.56s)]
*  raising the debt limit, enacting deep spending cuts, extending the Trump tax cuts from 2017, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1471.6399999999999s)]
*  as well as cracking down on immigration, implementing these new border security policies. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1480.04s)]
*  And they want to put it all into one bill. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1485.84s)]
*  That they're going to try to fast track through Congress using this process called budget [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1488.6s)]
*  reconciliation, which allows the Senate to pass a measure like this using just a simple [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1493.1999999999998s)]
*  majority vote. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1498.4399999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1499.4799999999998s)]
*  Democrats did this with the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1499.6399999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1502.04s)]
*  And the point of that is that it's a much lower threshold of support needed to pass this [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1502.4399999999998s)]
*  than what is usually required in the Senate. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1507.04s)]
*  Now the problem with this is that by jamming all of this legislation into one bill, maybe [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1509.4399999999998s)]
*  even jamming it into two bills, as some have suggested, is that this essentially becomes [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1514.68s)]
*  sort of a seesaw from hell. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1519.68s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1522.2800000000002s)]
*  Well, you have lawmakers who want to include very expensive immigration measures, who want [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1524.0800000000002s)]
*  to extend the Trump tax cuts, which are estimated to cost about four trillion dollars. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1530.64s)]
*  And at the same time, they want to make sure this bill doesn't cost money or add to the [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1535.88s)]
*  nation's debt. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1540.0800000000002s)]
*  And so that means in order to offset the costs of all of those other policies, you're going [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1541.8s)]
*  to have to enact some really deep spending cuts. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1546.8s)]
*  Now, there are certainly a number of lawmakers who would be happy to shutter entire agencies. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1550.12s)]
*  These are the Republicans in the House that we've mostly been talking about today. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1555.08s)]
*  But at the same time, both in the House and the Senate, you have more centrist Republicans, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1559.3999999999999s)]
*  particularly Republicans who represent purplish districts, states who just got out of tough [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1564.6s)]
*  re-elections, who certainly don't want to be seen as laying waste to the federal government, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1571.28s)]
*  shuttering programs that their constituents rely on. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1577.4799999999998s)]
*  And so this becomes a tremendously difficult balancing act to figure out how do you implement [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1580.8799999999999s)]
*  all these policies that are going to cost a lot of money while cutting a bunch of programs, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1586.28s)]
*  each of which have their own constituencies on the Hill. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1591.4399999999998s)]
*  And House Republican leaders have decided to add an extra layer of difficulty here. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1594.6s)]
*  They've said they want to make sure this legislation at least passes the House within [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1599.7199999999998s)]
*  the first 100 days of Trump's presidency. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1604.36s)]
*  Wow. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1606.6799999999998s)]
*  And that is a Herculean lift that we're now talking about. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1607.4399999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1611.28s)]
*  Getting a bill of this scale and this many different goals and competing interests passed [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1611.52s)]
*  in essentially three months. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1617.9599999999998s)]
*  With a one vote majority in the House. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1619.9199999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1621.9199999999998s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1622.56s)]
*  It feels, Katie, that we should end where we began with the certification of the election. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1623.52s)]
*  And the reality that four years ago, we couldn't have had this kind of conversation. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1629.28s)]
*  In fact, we didn't have this conversation because the Capitol had just been overrun by [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1633.84s)]
*  rioters who believed Donald Trump's false claim that the election had been stolen. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1639.36s)]
*  And it was chaos and it was trauma. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1644.12s)]
*  And now four years later, his victory to a second presidential term has been very [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1646.48s)]
*  peacefully certified, as you recounted, in a way that does give us the space to talk [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1651.92s)]
*  about his agenda and what his relationship with Congress will look like. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1657.92s)]
*  And it's very ironic that he's now been on both ends of this day. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1661.64s)]
*  Well, I remember in the days after January 6th talking to Republican members of [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1668.08s)]
*  Congress who themselves were sheltering in place at the Capitol on January 6th, who [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1673.76s)]
*  heard stories from their staff about their staff barricading themselves into their [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1681.08s)]
*  office to protect themselves from the rioters who were rampaging through the Capitol. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1685.8s)]
*  And I remember a lot of them being appalled by what happened, who were making the case [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1691.3600000000001s)]
*  that Donald Trump was not someone who should lead the Republican party. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1698.68s)]
*  And that in fact, in order to move on from January 6th, in order to move on from what [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1703.96s)]
*  had happened, that Republicans needed to walk away from him as a leader. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1708.92s)]
*  Now, fast forward four years later, voters have spoken. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1714.8s)]
*  They re-elected Trump to the White House for a second term. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1719.64s)]
*  They elected a Republican Congress, giving Republicans a majority in both the House [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1723.4s)]
*  and the Senate. And you have a Republican party that is pretty unified around Trump [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1729.4s)]
*  himself. And so it's a remarkable turnabout. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1735.52s)]
*  And it's not lost on me at all that the question now is not should they unify around [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1738.64s)]
*  Trump, but rather how unified can they be and how successful they will be at making [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1744.52s)]
*  his agenda come to fruition? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1751.44s)]

*  On Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that he would resign after almost [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1775.28s)]
*  a decade in power. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1781.12s)]
*  His resignation follows months of calls by members of his own party that he step aside [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnuMMXnalk&t=1783.2399999999998s)]
