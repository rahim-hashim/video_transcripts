*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro.
*  This is a Daily.
*  A few days ago, the Biden Administration issued a report that documents how the federal
*  government itself encourages Americans to make bad decisions about living with climate
*  change.
*  Today, White House reporter Jim Tancersley on why getting the government to encourage
*  the right decisions will be so hard.
*  It's Friday, March 24.
*  Jim, I arrive very skeptical that an economic report from deep inside the West Wing of the
*  White House can be interesting and sustained in episode, but I'm open-minded and I'm asking
*  you to prove me wrong.
*  So first off, I'm disappointed in you.
*  I can't believe that everyone else is not completely riveted by this report, but no,
*  here, let me sell you on why this is really important and interesting.
*  Okay, please.
*  So the economic report of the president is released every year.
*  Let's put together by the president's economic team and it's hundreds of pages of charts
*  and citations and deep detail about the way the economy is behaving and the way that it's
*  going to behave going forward.
*  Wait, wait, Jim, I just dozed off.
*  Sorry, were you selling what to hear?
*  Stay with me, Michael.
*  Go ahead.
*  I will concede that in the past, some of these reports have been more targeted toward what
*  we might call a deep nerd audience.
*  And niche audience.
*  And niche audience, people like me and professional economists and policy wonks, whose job it is
*  to really geek out about economic policy and projects.
*  But in this case, this year, there's a chapter that I think has big, broad, important
*  appeal to everybody.
*  It focuses on climate change and specifically how we are going to adapt to a warming world
*  and what that's going to cost.
*  And it reflects a goal the Biden administration has had over the last couple of years to better
*  present to the public what those risks of climate change look like and not to put to
*  find a point on it.
*  But it's basically a blueprint for how that adaptation might completely upend how we
*  think about almost everything the federal government does.
*  Wow.
*  How it spends money, how it encourages people to do things or not do things.
*  It's a really vividly detailed summary of all of the risks and costs of adapting to
*  climate change or not adapting to climate change.
*  All right.
*  Well, let's stipulate now that this does sound novel and important.
*  But we're pretty far along in a climate crisis.
*  So simply acknowledging that it will affect the federal government doesn't sound hugely
*  groundbreaking to me.
*  I mean, just a few days ago, a UN report came out that said what so many of these reports
*  ultimately say, which is we are in enormous trouble.
*  Yes.
*  And the White House report acknowledges that and it acknowledges that we are already living
*  with the effects of climate change.
*  Americans are already making decisions that are influenced by climate change.
*  But what the report also lays out really starkly is just how much government policies as
*  they are right now are encouraging people to take more risk in the face of climate change
*  to do riskier things, more expensive things that they probably shouldn't be doing if the
*  world's going to keep warming like this.
*  So this report posits that our federal government when it comes to climate changing, climate
*  adaptation is kind of in its own way.
*  It's part of the problem.
*  Yes.
*  And gets in people's way.
*  In places we live, the crops we plant, where we choose to build homes, all are flying
*  in the face of climate risk right now.
*  And I think there's a really easy way to understand why that is because we subsidize a lot
*  of behaviors through direct spending or regulations or the tax code.
*  We give people sort of a thumb on the scale for stuff they should do with their lives.
*  And that thumb was in a world where the risks were not nearly what they are from a changing
*  climate.
*  And so if you just keep with those existing policies, you create what economists call perverse
*  incentives or moral hazards, you're basically encouraging people to do the wrong things.
*  So walk us through how according to this report, the government creates perverse incentives
*  and moral hazards when it comes to climate.
*  Sure thing.
*  First, and I think this is very easy for people to understand the way we deal with natural
*  disasters in this country, the way the federal government tries to stop them or guard against
*  them or bail people out after they happen.
*  So let's take forest fires, for example.
*  The federal government fights fires all across the West and those fires are getting worse
*  and more damaging.
*  And the report says, hey, if we keep fighting fires around, say, you know, gated subdivisions
*  in parts of the West that are bone dry, that will continue to encourage people to live
*  in those places when maybe they should not be taking the risks of living in places that
*  are very prone to fire.
*  Right.
*  The same is true with flooding.
*  There's more flooding that's being linked to climate change and the federal government
*  basically backstops all flood insurance across the country.
*  And so it bears the costs of people living in flood zones.
*  And when they flood more often, the government's paying the money and people can sort of continue
*  to choose the live there.
*  Right.
*  And of course, the federal government backstops flood insurance.
*  We've talked about this a lot on the show because private flood insurance that you could
*  buy in theory on the open market is so prohibitively expensive because it actually reflects the
*  true cost of ensuring a house in a flood zone.
*  So the government kindly generously says, we got this.
*  We'll take care of it.
*  And you're saying that is incentivizing bad decision making around living in flood zones.
*  Yeah.
*  What the report says is that so long as the federal government does that, you're not going
*  to see people correctly accounting for the risks of where they live.
*  Exactly what you just said.
*  So the government is not fully pricing in as economists call it, the risks they're taking
*  by where they're choosing to build their homes.
*  And the costs of that end up being borne by taxpayers.
*  So people who don't live in risk areas end up subsidizing the people who do.
*  Right.
*  And we tend not to think of this as a subsidy.
*  We tend to think of it as a rescue.
*  It sounds like this report is starting to re-brand this as basically paying people to make
*  bad decisions.
*  Yeah.
*  Effectively, yes.
*  So that's natural disasters.
*  What else does the government do, according to this report, that essentially encourages
*  bad climate behavior?
*  So another way is not just ensuring homes, but also helping people to buy them.
*  So I think a lot of people know this, but some doubt the federal government plays a large
*  role in the mortgage market.
*  It has these what are called government-sponsored entities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, that essentially
*  take on mortgage risk from private lenders.
*  And there's all this evidence, the report sites, that lenders are quietly sending loans
*  they've made to houses in risky climate areas, think like coastal communities, vulnerable
*  to sea level rise.
*  They're sending those loans basically to the federal government.
*  If I'm a lender and I write a mortgage for that, I might be really worried that that house
*  gets washed away as the sea level goes up.
*  But if I can just offload that mortgage to the government or to Freddie and Fannie, well,
*  then I don't worry about it as much and I'm much more willing to write the loan.
*  And so that's what the report lays out, that by being able to offload those loans to
*  the government, private mortgage lenders are making riskier loans in the face of climate
*  change.
*  But it's not just where we live.
*  It's also what we grow, agriculture.
*  The federal government subsidizes insurance for big crops farmers grow.
*  If those crops fail for whatever reason, like there's a drought or a flood, then the insurance
*  pays out and the farmer isn't out a ton of money.
*  What the report says, by subsidizing that insurance, you're again taking some of that risk
*  away from farmers and encouraging farmers to grow the wrong crops in the wrong places,
*  essentially risky behavior and piling the costs on taxpayers.
*  Right.
*  This sounds a lot like the way the federal government plays a role in home insurance and flood
*  zones.
*  Sounds like it plays a similar role with crops being grown in climate vulnerable areas.
*  And I have to imagine this is especially problematic for farmers in the American West where there
*  is so much drought these days.
*  Yes, but also across places like Texas where cotton crops have been under a lot of pressure
*  lately and across the Midwest, I mean, there's no part of the country that's immune from climate
*  change.
*  Right.
*  Okay, so I recognize this is a long list of things.
*  And then a lot of it is maybe stuff that people don't associate with the federal government.
*  But I'm going to give you one more that is something everyone associates with the federal
*  government, Medicare, one of the biggest, most popular programs in American history.
*  And the report is very clear that climate change is going to affect health care spending,
*  Medicare and Medicaid.
*  And how exactly?
*  Because climate change is a health risk, particularly for poor people who have a harder time moving
*  to get away from the effects of climate change.
*  So if you are say a senior citizen living in Arizona where temperatures are getting higher
*  every year and you are at a higher risk of heat stroke or of respiratory disease from
*  air pollution linked to climate change, then you're going to have higher health care
*  costs that get built to the government.
*  Right.
*  So one way, very simple way to think about this is that the more people are at risk from
*  heatwaves and other climate related events, that's more money that it's going to cost
*  taxpayers to take care of them and more strains on the health care system, which is a huge
*  driver of the national debt going forward.
*  And the government might need to rethink how it spends that money and how it apportals
*  health care just to keep up.
*  I mean, one way or another, it feels like this report is essentially saying that the federal
*  government's policies are misaligned with or are misfiring in almost every corner of
*  American life when it comes to climate and yet Jim, just to play devil's advocate.
*  I mean, how exactly is that such a problem?
*  Because the government's job is to help people as they experience new challenges in their
*  lives and climate's a new challenge and the government is going to have to use its existing
*  systems to help them, right?
*  So what's the problem?
*  The Biden administration would absolutely agree and this report agrees that a big part
*  of the federal government's role in a warming world is to help people, particularly poor
*  people, adapt to climate change.
*  The report's all about making that adaptation less expensive.
*  There are smarter ways the report says to do all this and there are ways the government
*  can help people make smarter decisions on their own.
*  But there's a problem with helping people make smarter decisions.
*  It often means telling people things they don't want to hear.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Jim, how does this report from the White House propose getting people to make smarter
*  decisions and get the government out of its own way on climate given the specific policies
*  that we have been talking about so far?
*  Well, there's basically two very broad ways that the report talks about that.
*  The first is you can help people make better decisions by giving them better information
*  about the decisions they're making.
*  So if we don't really know what the risks are from climate change, it's hard for us as
*  consumers to know what to buy or where to live or what to plant.
*  And so the report suggests the government do more to actually quantify and specify what
*  those risks are.
*  But the second thing, and the much bigger, more overarching part of the report, is the
*  government needs to stop paying you to make what the government already believes are very
*  risky decisions.
*  And that is the big change it's proposing.
*  Sweeping changes to all sorts of government programs to pull some of that perverse incentive
*  back.
*  Okay, how does that actually work in practice?
*  Making people stop making bad decisions?
*  Well, let's go back to some of those examples we were talking about earlier.
*  Like take forest fires.
*  The report sort of posits maybe the forest service needs to do less wildland firefighting.
*  Maybe you should just let some places burn is the implication because they're too risky.
*  I mean, that would be a very big change and it might mean telling somebody that their
*  house is going to burn down.
*  Right, right, which nobody wants to hear that the government might let your house burn
*  down.
*  But that would be the implication of letting people bear that risk more on their own.
*  Okay, how else can the government change these incentives?
*  So I think another really big one and it's contained in this kind of fun shaded box
*  within the report, almost like a nerd Easter egg in the report, is about insurance markets
*  because sometimes the perverse incentive in the government is that insurers see the
*  risks of people living in certain areas and they just won't ensure them anymore and the
*  government ends up footing the bill.
*  Right.
*  So what the report envisions is completely rethinking how insurance works so that it's not the
*  government stepping in with a big check at the end, but that actually we're spreading
*  the costs over an efficient market over time.
*  Now, here's how that would work.
*  Right now you buy fire insurance or hurricane insurance or flood insurance, like as a separate
*  one off policy, the report envisions, and I guess they do this in some countries like
*  France and New Zealand, the big national multi-paralleled disaster insurance, basically just like
*  everything in one policy and everybody has to buy it, everybody pays into it and then
*  spreads the risk when disaster strike, that fund pays out the benefits.
*  So you're essentially creating a much broader risk pool and keeping the government from having
*  to pay these huge costs that again could be perversely incentivizing people because they
*  know the government's going to step in if bad things happen.
*  Right.
*  So this might not exactly stop people from having a house or building a house in the wrong
*  place, but it's going to prevent the federal government from footing the bill when the
*  cost of that decision comes due.
*  Right.
*  The idea is that the people in those areas will have at least some more skin in the game
*  because they'll be buying insurance of some kind even if a private insurer has pulled
*  out of their market.
*  And what about the crop insurance subsidies that you had mentioned?
*  What does this report suggest doing differently when it comes to something like that?
*  Well, the obvious implication from the report is the government should subsidize crop insurance
*  less in particular for highly climate change exposed crops.
*  And if you reduce the subsidy, there will be less of that planting.
*  So so far, the solutions seem kind of obvious, which is if a government policy has perverse
*  incentives, do less of that perverse incentivizing.
*  Yes.
*  That's what a lot of this policy is.
*  But the report goes beyond that.
*  And I think this is a fascinating part of it.
*  It talks about the federal government trying to use its muscle to try to change some of
*  the incentives that cities and states have right now that leads them to allow building
*  in risky places.
*  Okay.
*  Explain that.
*  What are the local incentives?
*  Well, there's a lot.
*  So right now, if you're a community on the coast or in the mountains and you green light
*  more building that is businesses or homes and that brings in property taxes, well, the
*  local government reads the values of that.
*  But overall, that building might be really risky for the country.
*  And if fires rip through those new homes, the federal government ends up often paying
*  the costs of the disaster relief.
*  Right.
*  So what the report suggests is, hey, let's condition federal dollars more on states and
*  cities making better decisions.
*  We're going to give money to the places that don't build on floodplains, that don't build
*  in fire zones that are more careful about what and where they build.
*  Interesting.
*  So in other words, the federal government knows that it can't tell a coastal community.
*  You can't build houses there.
*  Even though ultimately, if it all governments get a bear huge amount of the cost of bailing
*  out that community in a flood, but what it can do is say to the entire state, hey, you
*  want something from us, then you need to behave differently.
*  And that might trickle down to that coastal community and affect decision making there.
*  Right.
*  And we've got lots of money for infrastructure.
*  Perhaps you say even more so than the government already is, we're not going to rebuild your
*  bridge that keeps getting washed out by floods.
*  We're going to rebuild a bridge if you choose to build in a safer place.
*  Or we're not going to put broadband internet into that new subdivision in a really high fire
*  risk zone.
*  So a lot of the things we've already talked about are the federal government removing incentives.
*  This is the federal government exerting pressure.
*  It's using the power of its dollars to make city and state leaders feel like we need
*  to rethink how we are developing our communities if we want to be eligible for this federal funding.
*  Got it.
*  Doesn't that mean, Jim, if we're being honest, that many Republican controlled communities
*  and states whose leaders are openly skeptical of climate change are going to be a lot less
*  likely to therefore receive federal spending given the strings that would be attached to
*  it and more likely to be kind of punished under this kind of a system.
*  That's a complicated question.
*  And I think there's two answers to it.
*  The first is the report does note that places where people believe strongly in the science
*  of climate change tend to be better at adaptation and take less risk in the face of climate
*  change.
*  So in that sense, they'll be less hard hit.
*  In a second sense, a lot of liberals live in the mountains and on the coast.
*  And often you see communities there really fighting back against any idea that the government
*  is going to tell them they can't have that second home or they can't be where they want
*  to be.
*  Republicans certainly don't like the government telling them what to do.
*  But a lot of Democrats don't either.
*  And I think that's one of the real political challenges for any climate adaptation strategy
*  is the government is going to explicitly or implicitly be telling people a lot of ways
*  that they currently behave don't work anymore.
*  So the politics of this are saying are much more nuanced and complicated than they might
*  seem.
*  Absolutely.
*  Take my home state of Oregon, which is a fairly liberal state where people really believe
*  in general in the science of climate change.
*  When the state tried last year to publish a map showing fire risk for homeowners, Oregonians
*  just recoiled.
*  There was a huge outcry.
*  People were complaining that it was going to drive up their insurance costs and it was
*  going to drive down their property values.
*  And the state had to withdraw the map and then go back to the drawing board on a new process
*  for it this year.
*  And I think that just sort of shows just how difficult this is going to be trying to get
*  people to adapt to the risks of a changing climate because people want to live in their
*  homes.
*  They don't want to be told that the existing world they live in is suddenly more expensive
*  or less valuable.
*  Right.
*  What's interesting about that example, Jim, is that first of all, it's pretty modest,
*  just publishing a map that says you're at greater risk if you live here.
*  But it's also exactly what this report suggests the federal government needs to do.
*  Just tell people the truth, give them lots of data about where their risks are greatest,
*  and then follow up with carrots and sticks that either reward or punish communities based
*  on whether or not they're adapting to climate change.
*  That's exactly what this is so hard.
*  If just publishing a map that just shows fire risk is this difficult.
*  Imagine how hard it's going to be when the federal government comes along and says,
*  hey, we're not going to give you that grant because you just greenlit a subdivision that
*  we think is going to flood in 10 years.
*  I mean, it's just generally true in American politics, probably just politics, that it's
*  easier to give people carrots.
*  Hey, I'm going to incentivize you to do something that we think is right than to punish them
*  for doing something you think is wrong.
*  And actually, we know this from the administration's approach to climate change in a variety of
*  other ways.
*  They're subsidizing people buying electric vehicles because they think that's good.
*  They've chosen that path as opposed to making it more expensive to buy gasoline by putting
*  on a carbon tax.
*  And so what's really interesting in this report is it envisions a world where you're pulling
*  away subsidies, where you are changing risk behavior in part by a lot more punitive measures.
*  Right.
*  It's very clear that should this approach ever be adopted by the federal government, because
*  right now it's all very theoretical, there would be a ton of resistance.
*  So how likely is it, Jim, that what we're discussing, what this report envisions will ever
*  become reality, that the forest service might not fight fires that would save a house,
*  and that the government might withhold money to a community for a bridge if that state
*  doesn't get its climate act together.
*  How realistic is that?
*  I think the political pressure against these sort of government changes to adapt climate
*  change is going to be really high.
*  It's going to be hard for any future administration or this current one to start implementing a
*  bunch of these things.
*  But I also think that adapting to climate change is going to be hard.
*  And that is sort of the real tension driving the economics in this report.
*  You're probably not going to have a choice in a lot of these communities of just sticking
*  with the life you had before the world started warming.
*  You're going to be dealing with more forest fires.
*  You're going to be dealing with more sea level rise.
*  You're going to be dealing with more flooding and natural disaster.
*  And the only question is who pays for that.
*  What we are seeing from this report, what we see from all of the climate warnings we're
*  getting now is that it's becoming more immediate.
*  This is not some abstract concept where we have a binary choice of, oh, do we want to
*  deal with it or not?
*  You have to deal with it.
*  It's like paying your taxes.
*  You can put it off as long as you want, but at some point you have to sit down and deal
*  with it one way or another.
*  And I think what this report is trying to do is kind of make clear that there are less
*  expensive or more expensive ways to actually deal with it and hopefully steer people to
*  the less painful, less expensive ways.
*  Right.
*  You're saying we have to add something to that list of death and taxes, death and taxes
*  and the bill for climate change.
*  Those are the things that we have to deal with.
*  We have to deal with taxes adapting to the horrible realities of a warming world.
*  Yes, exactly Michael.
*  Jim, thank you very much.
*  Thank you so much for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  We do not trust TikTok will ever embrace American values.
*  Values for freedom, human rights and innovation.
*  During a five-hour congressional hearing on Thursday, lawmakers from both parties berated
*  the chief executive of TikTok claiming, frequently without evidence, that the hugely popular
*  platform is a tool of the Chinese government.
*  TikTok has repeatedly chosen the path for more control, more surveillance and more manipulation.
*  Your platform should be banned.
*  TikTok is owned by a company based in China, but in his testimony, its CEO, Sho Chiu, told
*  lawmakers that TikTok is an independent company that is not influenced by China and he assured
*  them that the company has carefully protected the data of its American users from any foreign
*  interference by making sure that that data never leaves the United States.
*  That's what we've been doing for the last two years.
*  Building what amounts to a firewall that seals off protected US user data from unauthorized
*  foreign access.
*  The bottom line is this, American data stored on American soil by an American company overseen
*  by American personnel.
