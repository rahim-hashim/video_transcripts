*  Hey, it's Michael.
*  This week, the Daily is revisiting some of our favorite episodes of the year, listening
*  back and hearing what's happened in the time since they first ran.
*  Today, we return to a historic plan that Major League Baseball rolled out this past spring
*  to try and save the sport from the tyranny of the home run and then explore whether
*  the plan has actually worked.
*  It's Friday, December 29.
*  So Mike, the last time that we had you want to talk about baseball, you came on to
*  talk about how the sport was weathering or not weathering the pandemic.
*  And the reason we've asked you to come back is because baseball is now experiencing another
*  major change.
*  So tell us about that change.
*  This season, baseball will operate under new rules that are the biggest changes in
*  on the field play, certainly in my lifetime, if not the history of the game.
*  Wow.
*  Just give me a couple of tastes of this change.
*  There's three big rule changes coming this season.
*  The pitch clock?
*  Kind of like a shot clock.
*  Sort of.
*  Yeah.
*  And what else?
*  The bases are bigger.
*  You won't be able to notice it with your eye, but they are bigger.
*  Correct.
*  And then you have Major League Baseball creating these rules about where defenders,
*  fielders in the field can stand.
*  What is driving these changes, Mike?
*  baseball is facing a semi existential threat in terms of its appeal to fans.
*  The game has become not only too long, but too boring.
*  The non baseball fan or baseball hater will sort of be laughing at that because they'll
*  say it was always boring.
*  It was always boring.
*  But it has tipped over the edge.
*  And I think as a fan and as someone who has covered the game and keeps a close eye on
*  it and still talks to people within the game that the home run is to blame.
*  Hmm.
*  That is a provocative thesis.
*  Yeah.
*  Look, the game has become addicted to the home run.
*  And because of that addiction to the most exciting play in the game, the whole game
*  has become boring.
*  So explain how it is that the home run has made baseball boring.
*  How we got to this point where we need these reforms.
*  So to understand that, we need to go back to the early days of Major League Baseball where
*  the home run was this engine that powered the growth of the sport.
*  Way back in the early 1900s, home runs were not the key driving force of the game, but
*  then came the 1920s.
*  A hard-hitting lefty named Babe Ruth comes along and captures the country's attention
*  through his slugging.
*  That ball blazed like a bullet when he connected.
*  This is the site the fans came to see.
*  And help the sports popularity grow and set it on a trajectory that it follows in the
*  decades that come.
*  The home run comes to create and define the iconic moments and players of the game.
*  The Bobby Thompson shot her round the world.
*  Figures like Mickey Mantle, Hank Aaron.
*  It's gone.
*  It's 750.
*  There's a new home run champion of all time.
*  And then the story of the home run takes a dramatic turn in the 90s.
*  And as we see, the home runs witness this extraordinary chase between Mark McGuire and
*  Sammy Sosa to break the single season home run record.
*  A feel good story of two sluggers criss-crossing the country as they try to hit the most home
*  runs.
*  On the night of September 8, 1998, McGuire and Sosa are actually playing against each
*  other and with the whole country watching.
*  McGuire breaks the record.
*  And the home run has never been more central.
*  Correct.
*  But what happens is that in the years that follow, we find out that that chase that felt
*  so good was built in part on a lie that the players were using band drugs.
*  Steroids.
*  Correct.
*  And it leads to a reckoning in the sense that the sport needs to police itself from
*  performance enhancing drugs.
*  But by no means does anyone turn away from the home run?
*  Why not?
*  Because a new phenomena further fuels the drive for the home run.
*  And that's the money-ballification of baseball.
*  I just explained that for the 25 listeners who didn't read the book or watch the movie.
*  Teams become very focused on statistics and the greatest chances mathematically of scoring
*  and preventing runs.
*  Let me give you an example of what this looks like.
*  Teams have so much data about where players are hitting the ball that they begin to rearrange
*  their defenses.
*  And as the sport is grappling with all of these changes on the field, the home run emerges
*  as far and away the most appealing way to score.
*  Right.
*  Because it's the only way to literally transcend and cut through all these data-driven
*  defenses that you just described.
*  Unless you're going to put your players on each other's shoulders in the outfield to
*  try and stop the ball from going up in the fence, there's nothing your fielders can
*  do.
*  So in the wake of a steroids scandal that wasn't part-inspired by perhaps an over-emphasis
*  on home runs, we get a data-driven system that still over-emphasizes our Uly home runs.
*  All roads keep leading back in baseball to the home run.
*  And it becomes so extreme that it leads to the problem of boredom that the sport is
*  now confronting.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So how exactly do home runs become boring?
*  Home runs themselves are not boring.
*  But everything else that comes with everyone in the game concentrating on them is because
*  instead of trying to learn how to spray the ball around the field, hitters start to concentrate
*  on doing everything they can to just try and hit a home run.
*  They change their swing to have more of an upper cut to try and hit it out of the park.
*  But because you're swinging up, you're also more likely to miss.
*  So in the process of this happening, you end up with one of three results, a strikeout,
*  a walk, or a home run.
*  And home runs don't happen all that often.
*  So the action on the field goes way down because you don't have just regular good old
*  fashion hits.
*  Right.
*  You don't have good old fashion baseball anymore.
*  You just kind of have an endless home run derby.
*  At the same time, teams that are pitching are trying to do everything to prevent that
*  home run.
*  So they're bringing in different pictures.
*  They are encouraging pictures to try and make sure that they get that strikeout.
*  So there's no contact to the bat.
*  And all of these things are slowing the game down.
*  Correct.
*  And games become longer.
*  They become 20 to 30 minutes longer on average.
*  And so at what point does the league say to itself, all right, enough.
*  We have got to do something about this.
*  We've got to make this work more fun.
*  We've got to make it faster.
*  So it being baseball, it took a while.
*  And in this story, there's one person who made that call.
*  So I went directly to him, the commissioner of baseball, Rob Manford.
*  So I've known you for almost 17 years.
*  We have screamed at each other.
*  But I remember him.
*  So what does Manford tell you?
*  So he knows there's a problem.
*  We did fan based research and fans wanted a game, brister pace, more athleticism.
*  They wanted that best form of baseball back.
*  It was because of baseball is too boring.
*  I don't think it was too boring.
*  I think that baseball changed.
*  He doesn't say that baseball has a boring problem.
*  But he confirms that there's a real pace issue.
*  Yeah, but I had a great consensus.
*  We needed to fix this.
*  So over many years, he plots this change.
*  Waiting till you got an agreement so that the players understood it was coming.
*  Talking to players about them, testing at the minor league level, what these changes
*  would be.
*  We played 8,000 games in the minor league, literally, with these rules.
*  And all that work finally culminates this season.
*  So tell me more about these rule changes you started to hint at them at the beginning
*  of our conversation.
*  Let's do it in more depth and how they're supposed to actually fix baseball's problems.
*  So again, there's three big changes coming this season.
*  The pitch clock, the bigger bases, and where fielders can stand in the field.
*  So let me start with the fielders.
*  Remember we talked about those data-driven defenses, essentially computers telling teams
*  where players should be on the field.
*  Right, which of course encourages people at bat to just hit home runs over the fielders
*  heads.
*  You can't do that anymore.
*  You can't stack the defense on one side.
*  And because of that, it opens up much more space for a player to hit a ground ball, a
*  base hit up through the middle or through one of the holes.
*  Got it.
*  And Mike, what about the pitch clock?
*  What does that have to do with the home run?
*  On the face of it, it doesn't have anything to do with the home run.
*  Sluggers will still be waiting for the perfect pitch.
*  But the fact that there's a clock means that the pitches will be coming more quickly,
*  and the game will be moving faster.
*  A ticker on your screen that gives the pitcher 15 or 20 seconds to deliver a pitch.
*  And if the pitcher doesn't pitch before the clock goes off, it's a ball.
*  Got it.
*  And then you have the larger bases.
*  One of the byproducts of the push for the home run meant that if you had a runner on
*  base and you were looking at the numbers, you wouldn't want the runner to try and steal.
*  Because the risk of getting called out stealing was too great because if the batter hit the
*  home run, that person would never come home.
*  Correct.
*  And you wouldn't get the extra run.
*  So it was worth it to not steal.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  Of course, stealing is exciting.
*  It's perhaps the most action-packed non-home run event of the game.
*  And those larger bases, it just makes it easier to steal.
*  And it also makes the game a bit safer because bigger bases gives more space and potentially
*  less collisions.
*  Right.
*  At the same time, there's a new rule that limits the number of times a pitcher can try and
*  pick off a runner.
*  Because it's just slowing the game down.
*  So by taking together, this is a campaign to make baseball more exciting by doing a few
*  things, elevating the other parts of the game that aren't home runs like the base hit
*  or the stolen base and making those home run hitters just be less of a drag on the overall
*  pace of the game.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think the way to look at it is that baseball is not trying to kick the home
*  run.
*  Right.
*  They're trying to kick the problems and things that come with it, that there's other things
*  going on.
*  Got it.
*  I'm very curious, Mike, how baseball players and fans have been reacting to these new
*  rules.
*  Surprisingly, it's been embraced.
*  And spring training games are more than 20 minutes shorter than they were last year.
*  More balls are being hit and play.
*  More players are trying to steal basis.
*  What is Manford and I talked about?
*  The real test starts in the regular season.
*  Right.
*  When the game's actually matter.
*  What could go wrong?
*  Oh, that's a stop to go.
*  And then theory, you could imagine moments where teams,
*  blame a loss on one of these new rules.
*  And it'll all come down on Manford.
*  Baseball is different.
*  It occupies a place in our culture that is very, very different.
*  And it comes with the burden that when you make a mistake, people care a hell of a lot
*  more about it than if it was in another sport.
*  And if the criticism gets to a certain point, they'll find somebody else to take the
*  job.
*  And I really am.
*  Of course, there's a very strong possibility that these rules changes won't make Manford a
*  lightning rod that they're going to be embraced.
*  Maybe they're even going to be celebrated.
*  Right.
*  They're going to make the sport better and maybe even usher in a golden era in the sport.
*  Golden era?
*  I don't know about that.
*  A more appealing, faster, efficient product that is not going to take four hours to watch
*  a nine-inning game.
*  Good chance.
*  And in that sense, we're watching an American institution embrace new and different things
*  in a potentially positive way, which is progress.
*  A bit remarkable.
*  Oh, Mike, as always, thank you very much.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  After the break, Mike Schmidt gives us an update on how the first season went with those
*  new rules in place.
*  It's now the end of the year and the baseball season and its playoffs are long in the
*  books.
*  So to get a sense of how these rules changes went, I called up Commissioner Rob Manford
*  to see what he thought.
*  And he was extremely pleased.
*  I mean, you don't need to be the commissioner to look at the numbers and see that this
*  went about as well as baseball could have hoped.
*  Well, the fastest game of the year in one hour and fifty five-hole minutes.
*  The time of game came down substantially almost a half an hour.
*  Jack, do you guys have dinner plans tonight or what?
*  This was a lightning quick game.
*  No, not that I know of.
*  And there was more action.
*  There were more hits than last season.
*  But perhaps the biggest most dramatic change was that stolen bases went through the roof.
*  There goes the elephant.
*  Jansen around.
*  There he goes.
*  Brody's second base on one hot pea is safe.
*  But second.
*  This season, there were more stolen bases across the game than there had been in any year
*  over the past three decades.
*  A mad dash around the bases for yelling.
*  So what we ended up with was a season in which the number of home runs did not go down.
*  But the other action on the field went up.
*  One of the things that Manfred was happiest about was that baseball saw all these benefits
*  without any major disasters along the way.
*  He said, look, the players adjusted to this even more quickly and efficiently than we thought
*  they would.
*  There weren't as many violations of the new rules that changed the outcome of games in really
*  high profile and disastrous ways.
*  Baseball still faces some significant challenges.
*  Its world series had its lowest ratings in history, which is not a great sign.
*  On the other hand, 70 million fans went to games this year, which is the highest numbers
*  since 2017, certainly a bounce back to pre-pandemic levels.
*  And there was just this feeling that baseball was even more relevant than it ever had been.
*  There was a buzz around it.
*  And as a lifelong fan, it was like, that's kind of cool.
