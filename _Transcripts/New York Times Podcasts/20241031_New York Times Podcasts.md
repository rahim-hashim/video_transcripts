# Defending Democracy vs. Defending the Status Quo
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp1RD6gQmL0)
*  It's not like Democrats are working from the premise that there is a problem with democracy they have to fix.
*  They're mostly saying the way the system's working is okay and Donald Trump broke it.
*  And what I hear mostly is an agreement on a problem that Democrats don't really speak to.
*  Right.
*  And so just explain that it will be one thing if Kamala Harris was saying our political system is not working and Donald Trump is exploiting that in a poor fashion.
*  But here is what the Democratic Party is going to do to make that system work better.
*  She's not saying.
*  And be more responsive.
*  That is not what they're saying.
*  They are not working from the premise that democracy is going well.
*  And so what I think they what I think their attack on Trump sometimes sounds like is a defense of a status quo system.
*  Right.
*  Not an acknowledgement of a problem and a pitch to improve it.
*  When you go.
*  And so it doesn't shock me.
*  It doesn't land for a certain group of people and it only lands for kind of moderate Republicans because those are people who are usually pretty invested who think the status quo is not all that bad.
*  Right.
*  That goes back to the poll.
*  When you criticize Trump for being a threat to democracy you may reinforce the idea that you think democracy is going well for people when that poll shows it's not.
*  You're hearing that too when you talk to voters.
*  Yes.
*  And all I'm saying is they it's not like they've ever tried the opposite to present a different type of vision of how you would reshape government to work better for people.
*  Got it.
*  They've never tried that.
*  They know that's not their effort really.
*  So all I'm saying is I don't like when the democracy argument is dismissed as ineffective when the democracy argument they're giving is just Donald Trump is bad.
*  They're not presenting a competing vision on how a system can work better for people.
*  And in my reporting I feel like that's the thing I hear the most with the type of voters they lose.
*  And so Donald Trump is promising change and that is bull in China shot.
*  You know I can see how he picks off a couple of those people when it feels like the other side is offering stability but you don't like what's in the China shot.
