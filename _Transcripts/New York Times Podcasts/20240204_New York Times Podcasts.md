*  Hi, my name is Malia Wallen and I'm a contributing writer for the New York Times magazine, based
*  in Oakland, California.
*  There's something iconically American about freight train robberies.
*  The very phrase evokes this sort of western Robin Hood narrative of late 19th century
*  heists. You think of the every man stealing from hugely wealthy railbearers with their price
*  fixing schemes and monopolistic practices. You think of folk ballots, dime novels, and
*  black and white western movies. You might also think of Jesse James and Butch Cassidy or
*  the film The Great Train Robbery.
*  But these train heists aren't just a relic of the past.
*  Theft from trains and trucks is actually on the rise today. In fact, since 2019 cargo theft
*  has almost doubled, costing as much as $50 billion in annual losses globally by one estimate.
*  Just think of how often you shop online, how things are delivered quickly, seamlessly.
*  It's almost like magic. In reality, behind your Amazon or Walmart order, there is a huge
*  mind-boggling network of trucks and trains and warehouses.
*  So for this week's Sunday read, I went on a wild ride through this supply chain that
*  most of us never really see, and the theory that comes with it.
*  So the thought of jumping onto a moving freight train might seem scary, but it's actually
*  not that hard. I know because I've done it myself. I grew up in a town in northern California
*  that was built around the tracks. As teenagers, my best friend and I started climbing up onto
*  moving freight trains. The train would crawl through town slowly, and we jaw along the
*  gravel beside it. You just grab hold, take a big step and pull yourself up. It's loud
*  and it's smelly, and it's weirdly thrilling.
*  Thieves access freight trains in much the same way. They pick a car and they hoist themselves
*  up. The containers have these locks that are surprisingly easy to cut. So thieves will
*  just bring bolt cutters or mechanized hand saws to cut the locks and pry them open, and
*  they start digging for whatever loot they can resell online. Anything from solar panels
*  and e-bikes to shoes or cookware. If there's nothing of value inside, they'll just pop
*  open the next container. Today, these thefts are even harder to detect because trains can
*  be up to three miles long and staffed by just two people. Oftentimes, the engineer and
*  conductor have no idea that a theft has even happened because it took place miles back.
*  Unopened, COVID rapid tests. We even have fishing lures.
*  You might have seen these train theft videos in the news a few years ago from Los Angeles,
*  the region with the highest rates of cargo theft in the country.
*  The thieves in action, the bolt cutters in hand, the wide open cargo containers.
*  Wow, that's all pulled from trains.
*  That's where I traveled for this story, to spend time shadowing the undercover cargo theft
*  detectives at the Los Angeles Police Department. The video clips showed this section of Union
*  Pacific tracks where for months people were opening shipping containers and ransacking them.
*  Everything raging from washer and dryers, tires, perfume, cologne, TVs.
*  Thousands of boxes were strewn everywhere.
*  Some people online responded with a kind of glee, relishing the return of this old-fashioned American crime.
*  Train rowing, we've gone back in time. It isn't for oil, we don't want this one.
*  Get an open cap and let it run out. We're going to grab these Sony DCs.
*  My story gets into why this type of supply chain piracy is so widespread today,
*  and why it's so difficult to solve.
*  So here's my article, The Great Freight Train Heists of the 21st Century,
*  read by Julia Whalen. Our audio producer today is Adrian Hurst. The original music you'll hear
*  was written and performed by Aaron Esposito.
*  Of all the dozens of suspected thieves questioned by the detectives of the train burglary task force
*  at the Los Angeles Police Department during the months they spent investigating the rise in theft
*  from the city's freight trains. One man stood out. What made Victor Yamas memorable wasn't his
*  criminality so much as his giddy enthusiasm for trespassing. He was a self-taught expert of the
*  supply chain, a connoisseur of shipping containers. Even in custody, as the detectives interrogated
*  him numerous times after multiple arrests in a windowless police station room in the spring of
*  2022, a kind of nostalgia would sweep over the man. He said that was the best feeling he'd ever had,
*  jumping on the train while it was moving. Joe Chavez, who supervised the task force's detectives,
*  told me. It was euphoric for him. According to detectives, Yamas divulged how he learned to decode
*  the containers stacked on freight trains through his repeated break-ins and by googling the placards,
*  locking devices, logos and numbers on the containers, which often provided clues to the loot he
*  might find inside. An upgraded lock was a sure sign of more valuable contents. Inside the containers,
*  most of them were secured with metal locks about the size and shape of a corkscrew that easily succumbed
*  to his bolt cutters or mechanized handsaw. The items were varied and plentiful. TVs, beer, clothing,
*  makeup, shoes, electric bicycles, hard drives, tablets. Yamas worked with Kanye R.
*  Ismendi, his girlfriend at the time. After becoming aware of them, the detectives put a tracking
*  device on the couple's SUV and followed them around Southern California. The couple would set up
*  in a motel near the tracks somewhere out in the inland empire or farther south. They ranged as far
*  as Barso, more than 100 miles to the east. After nightfall, they would hit the trains and then
*  often shuttle cargo back to their motel rooms for storage. By that point, Chavez, who is 58,
*  had been at the LAPD for nearly 35 years, working homicides, drugs, gangs, auto thefts and
*  robberies, and he had never heard anyone talk about his crimes as rapturously as Yamas.
*  He straight out told me, he goes, detective Chavez, I'm never going to stop doing it. Chavez says.
*  Some 20 million containers move through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach every year,
*  including about 35% of all the imports into the United States from Asia. Once these steel boxes
*  leave the relative security of a ship at port, they are loaded onto trains and trucks.
*  And then things start disappearing. The Los Angeles Basin is the country's undisputed capital
*  of cargo theft, the region with the most reported incidents of stuffed stolen from trains and trucks
*  and those interstitial spaces in the supply chain, like rail yards, warehouses, truck stops and
*  parking lots. Cases of reported cargo theft in the United States have nearly doubled since 2019,
*  according to Cargonet, a theft-focused subsidiary of Varisk, a multinational company that
*  analyzes business risks, primarily for the insurance sector. On Cargonet's map of cargo theft
*  hotspots, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta, and Memphis show up as distinct, high incident red blobs.
*  But the biggest blob, a red, oblong smear, stretches out over the Los Angeles valley like molten lava.
*  Freight trains are massive mechanical constructions, but because they've been on the landscape
*  for so long, they tend to be part of the background, like hills. In Los Angeles, however,
*  trains roared back into the public imagination in late November 2021, when a local NBC affiliate
*  ran footage from a section of Union Pacific tracks, strewed with thousands of ransacked boxes.
*  The video included a man with bolt-cutters climbing up onto moving cars and reporters
*  calls to the package's intended recipients, as well as their reactions to seeing their emptied
*  out boxes. I'm honestly just disgusted in human behavior, set a woman in Seattle, who was waiting
*  for a car seat for her unborn baby. It was like an iMac scale version of those now ubiquitous
*  security camera videos of porch pirates sneaking off with deliveries. Soon, videos of the trains
*  were circulating all over. By January, the story had become international news, and the images
*  a kind of culture war war shock test. When a photojournalist and helicopter cameraman for CBS
*  Los Angeles posted a thread to Twitter featuring similar footage, tens of thousands of people
*  retweeted and commented. Some viewers saw the videos as evidence of the absurdity of global e-commerce
*  run-a-muck. Some even reveled that the return of an iconic American crime. One respondent
*  posted a clip of Robert Redford and Paul Newman in Butch Cassidy in the Sundance Kid. Another
*  clip, who will cry for the Amazon packages. But other viewers saw the entire mess as
*  illustrative of a kind of dystopian lawlessness they attributed to liberal cities gone rogue.
*  This breakdown of order is happening because the bedrock of civilized society, the rule of law
*  has been abandoned, the editors of National Review wrote. For Los Angeles District Attorney,
*  George Gascon, a paradigm exemplar of today's progressive prosecutors, this is literally the
*  express track redistribution of wealth. At the time, Union Pacific claimed that about 90
*  containers were being opened per day, and that theft on their freight trains in the area was up
*  some 160% from the previous year. About 80 guns were stolen from trains. In early 2022,
*  Governor Gavin Newsom dawned a pair of work gloves and picked up scattered boxes on the tracks
*  himself. What the hell is going on? He asked the assembled television news crews.
*  The Los Angeles Police Department scrambled to respond. Chavez and his crew of detectives were
*  put on the case. The boxes on the tracks were cleaned up, and for the most part, the story went
*  quiet. But under the placid surface of digital commerce, even as consumers continued to get almost
*  all of their online orders delivered to their doors so seamlessly and quickly it felt vaguely like
*  magic, the supply chain roiled, plagued by thieves, and things continued to go missing. Whole trucks
*  and train cars worth of things. Give me a call regarding your land pirate story.
*  The text that popped up on my phone last fall was from the communications guy at the brotherhood
*  of locomotive engineers and trainmen, which represents more than 51,000 members. He connected
*  me with Edward A. Hall, who in late 2022 won an upset election to become the Union's national
*  president after spending 28 years as an engineer for Union Pacific, first in El Paso, Texas,
*  but mostly out of Tucson, Arizona. I wanted to know what it was like to be inside a train during a
*  heist. Up in the cab Hall told me he regularly passed stopped trains and saw people clambering
*  up ladders or loading cargo into their trucks pulled up alongside the tracks. Sometimes he saw
*  people breaking into moving trains too. He would call the rail police dispatcher and keep going.
*  Those container doors, meanwhile, stayed open, he said, trailing boxes as the train rolled on.
*  Hall saw all kinds of merchandise spread out across the tracks, including tires and televisions.
*  Engineers don't stop for this flotsam of global capitalism. They run over it.
*  Once near the Dragrun Mountains in Southeast Arizona, Hall drove a train through a desolate quarter
*  mile of track littered with hundreds of pairs of Nike sneakers. Between LA and Tucson is where I know
*  a lot of theft happens. Hall said. The most extreme type of modern train theft occurs when thieves cut
*  the air compression brake hoses that run between train cars, thereby triggering an emergency
*  braking system. When that happens, the engineer stays in the cab and the conductor walks the
*  length of the stop train trying to locate the source of the problem. Thieves can also stop a train
*  by decoupling some of its cars. Of course, if a train is miles long, that walk takes a while.
*  In the meantime, the pilferers unload. Law enforcement officials told me that it's not uncommon for
*  thieves to target specific cars full of electronics, say, or tires, in a way that suggests
*  previous knowledge of their contents. Gary Rogers, a former Union Pacific Law Enforcement agent,
*  says that during his decades working throughout the West, he saw thieves coordinate their movements
*  precisely. One of them would climb aboard a moving train and know just when and to what extent
*  to cut into the air compression hose. The train would stop and the guys would be there waiting to
*  unload. Rogers told me. It's easy to imagine how frightening a heist might be for a train engineer
*  and conductor, but in cases when the train has not been stopped, they often have no idea it's even
*  happening. Sometimes they won't know for hundreds, maybe thousands of miles, until they arrive at their
*  destination and discover looted cars. Pyracy is an age-old occupation, particularly prevalent in
*  places and times when large gaps have separated the rich and the poor. But this modern-day
*  resurgence in Cargo theft stems in no small part from the extreme ways the internet has altered
*  the buying and selling of things. When the United States Census Bureau began collecting data on e-commerce
*  in 1998, online sales amounted to some $5 billion. Now, that figure is upward of $958 billion.
*  e-commerce revenue is forecast to exceed $2.5 trillion by 2027.
*  The need to get packages to consumers quickly has reshaped the infrastructural landscape,
*  changing the way freight moves around the world through more warehouses, distribution centers,
*  modes of transport, trucks, trains, planes, delivery drivers. This ever-quickening
*  tangle has opened new vulnerabilities to be exploited by supply chain thieves.
*  Many in the industry would prefer not to talk about theft. Union Pacific and BNSF Railway declined
*  my interview requests. They, each, along with the Association of American Railroads,
*  an industry trade group representing major freight rail, provided written statements,
*  emphasizing their commitment to combating theft. None of the parties involved, the rail companies,
*  the truckers, the shippers, the warehouses, the insurance companies are required to publicly
*  disclose stolen freight either. On the website of Operation Boiling Point, which the Department of
*  Homeland Security recently created to go after organized theft groups, the agency states that
*  cargo theft accounts for between $15 billion and $35 billion in annual losses.
*  The Federal Bureau of Investigation, in a statement emailed to me, estimated that cargo theft
*  losses amounted to $1 billion nationally in 2021, but the agency acknowledged that that was
*  an undercount. An FBI spokesperson also confirmed that the agency is working with the rail companies
*  and deploying special agents from its major theft program to address rail and cargo theft in known
*  trouble spots. One expert on supply chain risks gave me an estimate of $50 billion in annual losses
*  globally and noted that this kind of crime is a notorious problem in Mexico and Brazil.
*  But essentially, it's impossible to get a clear picture of how much is perloined from the
*  supply chain, who takes it, or where it goes next. We do know that often these hijacked goods are
*  cycled back into the online ecosystem, turning up for sale on places like Amazon, eBay, Etsy,
*  and Facebook Marketplace. Some eBikes, Chavez, watched Yamas and others take from the trains,
*  later showed up on OfferUp. Sometimes, products stolen out of Amazon containers are resold by
*  third-party sellers back on Amazon, in a kind of strange euro-borus in which the snakehead of capitalism
*  hungrily swallows its piracy tail. Last June, California's Attorney General created what was
*  touted as a first-of-its-kind agreement among online retailers that committed them to doing a better
*  job tracking, reporting, and preventing stolen items from being resold on their platforms.
*  While declining to comment on specific cases, a spokesperson for Amazon told me that the company
*  is working to improve the process of vetting sellers. The number of bad actor attempts to create
*  new selling accounts on Amazon decreased to 800,000 in 2022 from 6 million in 2020.
*  But Filched Cargo can be hard to get a handle on. It shapeshifts in effect. If you're buying brand
*  new speakers from someone's trunk in a parking lot, you can probably deduce that there's a good
*  chance they were ripped off, but the anonymity of the internet essentially launders stuff.
*  Cindy M. Rosen, Executive Director of the America's focused branch of the Transported Asset
*  Protection Association, told me that the job of tracking misappropriated goods across borders
*  and territories and law enforcement jurisdictions is often futile, particularly when merchandise is
*  moved out of the country before being sold back into the United States online. Rosen would know.
*  Her organization is made up of insurance companies, federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies,
*  security firms, shippers, truckers, railroad companies, and manufacturers.
*  You're basically trying to catch a fly in a dark room, she says.
*  More freight is moved on trucks than on trains, and much more is stolen off trucks too.
*  Trucking is a chaotic industry with hundreds of thousands of companies, some as small as a
*  single driver and a truck. Rail, on the other hand, is essentially do-op holistic. Just two companies,
*  Union Pacific and BNSF Railway, serve the entire Western United States. CSX transportation and
*  Norfolk Southern Railway dominate the East. Against trucks, thieves use various forms of digital
*  forgery and cyber fraud, including something called a fictitious pickup in which someone impersonates
*  an authorized truck driver online and reroutes a truck's load. This kind of theft increased almost
*  600 percent between 2021 and 2022, according to cargo net data. And on the rails, some cargo,
*  coal, grain, cement, fertilizer, hydrochemicals, lumber is just too cumbersome to appeal to thieves.
*  It's easier to run off with pallets of beer or the newest issue Nike's.
*  But railroads have increasingly been vying to move more containerized freight.
*  They want to make the most of the e-commerce boom. The fastest growing segment of rail traffic
*  is what's called intermodal, which refers to shipping containers and trailers that move on more
*  than one mode of transit, ships, trains, and trucks. These containers often carry merchandise bound
*  for stores or packages bound for consumers. Amazon, for example, now has its own branded containers,
*  in part to meet its net zero carbon emission goal. Calling a ton of goods on rail produces about
*  eight times less emission than on a truck. Such intermodal trains tend to be long, which can make
*  them more vulnerable. Over the past decade, in a push for greater efficiency and amid record
*  breaking profits, the country's largest railroads have been stringing together longer trains.
*  Some now stretch two or even three miles in length. At the same time, these companies cut the number
*  of employees by nearly 30 percent, so fewer people now manage these longer trains. Currently,
*  the Federal Railroad Administration does not place limits on freight train length, despite safety
*  concerns. The tracks heading away from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are thick with
*  long trains carrying intermodal containers, teaming with imports from Asia, electronics, toys,
*  clothing, shoes, food and beverages. Just the sort of offerings thieves find most enticing.
*  See this? One of the plain clothes, LAPD cargo theft unit detectives, was directing my attention
*  to a box of electronic bird feeders with a yellow sticker on it, showing an image of batteries.
*  Thieves look for placards like this because they know there will be some kind of electronics inside,
*  he said. We were in a 7,500 square foot windowless warehouse, surrounded by metal fencing and looped
*  barbed wire, located under interstate 10 in downtown Los Angeles. The warehouse packed with
*  $5 million worth of cargo stolen from BNSF Railway, belonged to the California Department of
*  Transportation, but had been leased or sub-leased by thieves, the detectives were still trying to
*  identify. They ran across the place almost accidentally a few days earlier, while tracking a truckload
*  of boosted tires. Inside the cavernous room, the towering stacks included pallets of Nike shoes,
*  more pallets piled high with a deedus shoes, under armor leggings, crocs and countless colors and
*  sizes tumbling from boxes onto the dusty floor, air purifiers, computer monitors, thousands of
*  bottles of melatonin gummies, those knee scooters people roll around on after injuries, cordless robotic
*  wool cleaners, tobaccoless cigarettes that smelled like lawn clippings, vape pens, R.E.I. outdoor gear,
*  boxes of plastic trash can liners, bluetooth speakers, plastic shower curtains, car seats, stainless
*  steel cookware, and Disney bagpacks featuring a heroin I didn't recognize. An image search later
*  revealed that she was Aasha from an animated film, wish that had not yet been released.
*  One of the two detectives at the warehouse was previously on the train burglary task force with
*  Chavez, because they work undercover, I'm not using their names. The detectives studied the labels
*  and purchased order numbers on the boxes in order to determine the companies of origin and where
*  their goods were being shipped to and from. Then they called asset recovery specialists at the
*  companies. Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour had already sent trucks to recoup their missing goods.
*  The detectives didn't know yet where the items were stolen, or even if they were taken from an
*  eastbound train or a westbound train or a truck in a rail yard. They suspected that the jumble
*  had been accumulating in this warehouse for months. A BNSF special agent was present too,
*  creating an inventory of the pillaged property. In most states, the railroad police are certified
*  law enforcement officers with arrest powers on and off the tracks. He wouldn't give me his name,
*  because he wasn't authorized to talk to the media, but we chatted for a while as two BNSF workers
*  with a forklift loaded the pallets into waiting trucks to be taken to another warehouse.
*  Unprompted, he said that he wanted to retire to an island with no trains, a place where he would
*  never again hear a lonesome train whistle at night. I hate that, he told me.
*  Some of the stockpile in the warehouse would most likely be reclaimed. Some would be sold to liquidators.
*  Some would be tossed. The detectives told me that most ingestible things are destroyed,
*  who wants the liability of putting recovered food, beverages, or medicines back into the supply chain.
*  One detective's cell phone rang. It's Disney, he said, talking the receiver under his chin.
*  It turned out the company had opened its own case into those missing backpacks,
*  which were looted on route to Las Vegas, thereby prematurely letting this heroin out into the world.
*  It is not unusual for stolen cargo to be hidden for a time in just such a warehouse before it
*  can be resold. One night in the spring of 2022, Chavez and his crew of detectives sat in unmarked
*  cars on a road beside the tracks where trains leave the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.
*  It was here on what's called the Alameda Corridor, where the detectives first spotted the
*  enthusiastic Yamas, loading up a car with oversized boxes containing high-end electric bicycles
*  fresh off the train. That night, the detectives followed him to Franz Sisko Guerra,
*  who stashed cargo in a parking lot and in a warehouse packed with burglarized items,
*  including brand new coffins. The detectives were looking for people working together
*  like this in organized fencing rings. Someone who buys and sells plundered goods is called a fence.
*  But over the course of the task force's existence, which lasted nearly a year,
*  only 34 of the roughly 700 people arrested or cited for stealing from trains were part of
*  these organized crews. Many more were just passers-by or unhoused people living near the tracks in
*  RVs or makeshift structures who just happened to pick up fallen boxes. Chavez gave me a driving tour
*  of the Alameda Corridor and the city's other train theft hotspots in his truck one bright day last
*  October. The tracks were no longer littered with boxes, new fencing and barbed wire had been put
*  up beside them. Keep your eyes out, Chavez told me. I wouldn't be surprised if we see someone stealing
*  stuff off the trains today. We pulled up alongside a Union-Pacific freight train waiting to enter a yard.
*  They hit that one, he said. He had stopped his truck in the middle of busy,
*  valuable of art to point out a container with its doors hanging wide open. Most of the train cars
*  carried double-stacked containers. Many of the top containers had been breached. In some,
*  we could see cardboard packages of various sizes. Others looked empty. See, they hit that one too,
*  Chavez said. That's Walmart. You know they're going to hit that one.
*  Earlier that morning, before he picked me up, Chavez took the psychological exam required to become
*  a law enforcement agent for BNSF Railway. He retired from the police force early in 2023,
*  just after the train burglary task force disbanded. Soon, he would be somewhere out along the
*  company's 32,500 miles of track, which had him thinking about Yamas. In late 2022, Yamas,
*  Rizmendi, and their fence, Gera, were arrested, and each charged with multiple felonies related to
*  train heists. Rizmendi and Gera are serving time in jail. Yamas, however, stopped showing up to
*  his court dates and vanished, after pleading not guilty to eight felony charges and posting bail.
*  I have a feeling I'll see him again. Chavez told me, his eyes scanning the trains as if he might
*  spot the man that very day, scaling the side of a train in motion, bolt cutters in hand.
*  Climbing a board of moving freight train isn't as difficult as it might seem. I know, I've done it.
*  My hometown in Northern California, like many western towns, was tiny and sliced through by tracks.
*  In 9th grade, my best friend and I started pulling ourselves up on freight trains as they crawled
*  through town before beginning their ascent into the Sierra's. We were bored and had recently
*  discovered the beatwriters and were making a literary scene on my dad's copy machine.
*  Teenage girls scrambling atop the machinery of capitalism was appealingly transgressive.
*  If Jack Carawag and blues musicians and the teenagers of the Great Depression could hop trains
*  without being crushed, we could too. I can relate a little at least to Yamas' exuberance.
*  Clinging on with one hand, we sometimes used rusty nails to scratch words on the
*  brightly painted boxes before jumping back down into the sharp gravel and walking back toward home.
*  We never went more than a mile and we never stole anything.
*  Although honestly, I wonder now if we might have tried to. Had we known how easy it is to open those
*  containers. While truckers are sometimes hijacked at
*  gun or knife point, train theft is almost exclusively non-violent nowadays.
*  Not so, with old timey train robbers who were notedly homicidal with a pension for explosives.
*  In one study published in the journal Criminal Justice Review, researchers analyzed information
*  called from newspaper accounts of 241 train heists that occurred between 1866 and 1930.
*  Granted, reporters were most likely covering the more violent robberies,
*  but still, more than 90% of them were committed at gunpoint, nearly 30% involved dynamite,
*  and in roughly as many cases, at least one person was shot.
*  Sometimes thieves would blow up the track, derailing the train and killing passengers.
*  Newspapers breathlessly covered the thefts, as did Western dime novels and traveling wild west
*  chose. Notorious train thieves like Butch Cassidy and Jesse James became household names.
*  In 1903, moviegoers flocked to theaters to see a short silent film, The Great Train Robbery,
*  featuring four gunslinging bandits commandeering a train and stealing valuables from passengers
*  before escaping on horseback, only to be chased down by a local posse and killed in a shootout.
*  Westerns, with their themes of crime, pursuit, and retribution,
*  became part of how we think about criminal justice and the landscapes of the West.
*  It wasn't uncommon for some train robbers to enjoy a kind of folk hero status too.
*  One thief, William L. Carlyle, who started sticking up trains in Wyoming in 1916,
*  was known as the Robin Hood of the Rails, for his practice of never taking money from women,
*  children, or service men, and for occasionally redistributing a snatched coin before fleeing.
*  When the Library of Congress and ethno musicologists to travel the country in the late 1930s to
*  record folk music, they returned to Washington with numerous ballads in both English and Spanish
*  about train bandits. The rail companies didn't enjoy the same populist affection.
*  They were owned by railbearers who engaged in monopolistic practices and price fixing schemes
*  while exposing workers and passengers to the sort of danger that's hard to imagine today.
*  The railroad was the largest single cause of violent death,
*  Mark Aldrich, an economic historian, writes in his 2006 book Death Road the Rails,
*  which details dismemberments, derailments, bridge collapses, and run-over pedestrians.
*  In the early 20th century, nearly 12,000 people were killed annually by trains,
*  vastly more than were killed by train thieves.
*  The human geography of the west is so entangled with the railroad as to be indistinguishable from it.
*  Entire cities and towns exist and persist because people organized themselves around the train.
*  When Charles Hodgson, a researcher who is now an economics professor at Yale, studied the
*  effect of railroad construction between 1868 and 1889 on the distribution of towns in the American
*  West, he found that post offices, a stand-in for town health, nearest to train tracks, were much
*  likely to still be extant in 2010 than those a bit farther afield. These latter towns eventually
*  collapsed in what researchers call the agglomeration shadow as people moved and clumped together
*  along the tracks. By the late 19th century, the railroads had a growing army of private police.
*  They didn't exactly help the railroads bolster their appeal with many local communities.
*  These private police forces were often supplied by the Pinkerton's National Detective Agency,
*  known for hunting down train berglers and violently breaking up Union strikes.
*  In his history of the Pinkerton's, the historian S. Paul O'Hara describes the agency as
*  the apotheosis of industrial violence and corporate power in gilded age America.
*  The legacy of using private security to guard the movement of freight is alive and well in the
*  modern day supply chain too. Insurance, shipping and retail companies hire private investigators,
*  asset recovery teams, and loss prevention personnel, many of them former police officers.
*  Though the rail companies have their own police forces and interstate law enforcement authority,
*  Union-Pacific police officers, for example, patrol 32,000 miles of track in 23 states,
*  much of the work still falls to local law enforcement.
*  Last fall, I met Buddy Porch, a detective from the Fontana Police Department at a monthly
*  meeting of the Western States Cargo Theft Association. He is one of two detectives recently
*  assigned to Cargo Theft in Fontana, a city of 200,000 or so, some 50 miles east of Los Angeles.
*  We're just being hammered, completely overwhelmed, he told me.
*  The city has been transformed by speedily constructed, prefabricated tilt-up mega warehouses.
*  Loads from semi-trucks are being taken, train cars emptied out. The entire region has been
*  altered by digital commerce. The inland empire now has an excess of 1.4 billion square feet of
*  warehouse space, with plans for millions more. It's a place run through by train tracks and
*  traversed by nearly a million trucks daily, spewing carbon dioxide and pollutants, and tempting
*  all manner of thievery. It's a lot for Buddy Porch. The technology exists to make containers
*  less susceptible to Theft. Companies sell container locking devices with GPS and cellular
*  connectivity that permit the containers to be tracked at all times. Sensors stuck on the freight
*  itself can report locations and precise conditions inside containers, including temperature,
*  humidity, and the bumpiness of the ride. Containers can be outfitted with smart seals,
*  motion detection alarms, video surveillance, and infrared imaging systems that can detect
*  intruder's body heat. And yet, the locks so often used to secure containers with hundreds of
*  thousands of dollars worth of merchandise inside are easier to cut off than the lock I use to
*  secure my old beater bicycle. I kept asking people, why? The answers were varied, but as far as
*  I can tell, the reason is that in the last several decades, the cost of shipping has fallen so much
*  that cheap shipping has become part of the essential energy force pushing the tsunami of low-cost
*  goods across the seas and onto our shores. A company with 20,000 containers might decide it
*  isn't worth an extra $10 per container for better locks or seals. In part, because even if they
*  did opt for the upgraded security, who or what would respond when the alarm goes off, or when the
*  smart seal sends notice that it's been breached? What if the signal pings from a train in the middle
*  of some empty stretch in West Texas? Anything that adds to that transportation cost, including security,
*  is typically thought of as extraneous or unnecessary. Tony Pelley, director of security and resilience
*  at the multinational business consultancy BSI group, told me. After all, most cargo is insured anyway.
*  But the insurance companies, for their part, would very much like to reduce the plundering.
*  Travelers, one of the largest cargo insurers in the country,
*  employs 12 full-time cargo theft investigators who travel the land, sometimes lending a
*  sting trailer wired with surveillance equipment to law enforcement to claw back some of those stolen
*  goods. They're also trying to educate warehousing, shipping, trucking, and rail companies on how to
*  deter thieves in the first place. Talk to anyone whose business is protecting or ensuring freight,
*  and they will tell you some iteration of cargo at rest is cargo at risk. They advise
*  truckers, for example, to avoid stopping at all within the first 200 miles from their pickup point
*  in case they're being followed. An opened box of makers mark whiskey bottles sat by a cubicle on
*  the fifth floor of LAPD's imposing downtown headquarters, evidence from a recently recovered
*  stolen truckload. A cargo theft detective cell phone rang. On the other end, was an officer from
*  a division to the south who had received a 911 call reporting that two men were rifling through
*  an Amazon truck trailer. 15 minutes later, when the two detectives pulled up in their two separate
*  cars to the blue container, with its telltale swooping logo, they could see that the truck's
*  cab was gone. The container's back doors were ajar, and boxes had spilled out onto the sidewalk.
*  Following a detective, I eagerly climbed up into the container, wondering if my anticipatory
*  excitement was akin to what thieves feel when they steal a container but don't yet know what
*  their treasure hunt will yield. What I found inside were boxes and boxes of arm and hammer forever
*  fresh cat litter. It looks like a load of Amazon crap, said the shorter detective still standing on
*  the street, hands on hips, peering inside. A bit deeper in, I could see plastic and high-scratch cat
*  protector couch covers, Cheerios, Christmas Advent puzzles, more cat litter. Someone had been there
*  before us and had helped themselves to the funnables Super Mario Fruit Flavored snacks. The colorful
*  candies and ravaged packaging were scattered across the floor. The detectives figured someone had
*  probably stolen the truck, popped open the container, found it rich in cat litter, and ditched it.
*  The taller detective called someone in asset recovery at Amazon, who confirmed that the container
*  should have arrived in another city two days earlier. The detective asked the Amazon rep if the
*  company was planning to come claim the container. The two of them went back and forth for a while
*  until eventually the detective told the rep that he had 90 minutes to get someone there or the
*  police would impound the container. It doesn't make sense for us to spend half the day babysitting
*  this thing. The detective said, exasperated when he got off the phone. After a tow truck took the
*  container away, the detectives returned to the neighborhood police station. Earlier that morning,
*  LAPD officers patrolling the area near the abandoned container spotted a black SUV with two men inside
*  that matched the description given by the 911 caller. They pulled the vehicle over and seeing
*  what looked like Amazon packages inside took the men into custody. Now the taller detective
*  interviewed them with the help of another Spanish speaking officer. At first, the men in custody
*  didn't want to talk. Then the detective brought in snacks and water. The detective told me,
*  I said, look, you're not El Chapo. This isn't the crime of the century. This is just some junk in an
*  Amazon trailer. One of the men started talking. He told the detective that he was mostly living on
*  the streets. The SUV belonged to his brother. The container was already open when they found it.
*  A person he didn't know offered him $20 to help unload. He and his friend took the money and when
*  they were done, they grabbed some spoils for themselves too, which they had stashed in his brother's
*  tent down by the railroad tracks. The detectives put the man who talked, the one with the brother,
*  in a police vehicle, and had him direct a patrol officer to his brother's tent. The two detectives
*  followed behind until they pulled up to a row of structures built from plywood and tarps,
*  along a section of seemingly abandoned tracks near the intersection of East Olympic Boulevard
*  and Lemmon Street. All we want is the stuff. The taller detective told the man identified as the
*  brother. We don't care about anyone else or anything that's going on. The man by the tent looked at
*  his brother in the back of the patrol car with one of the weirdest expressions I have ever seen.
*  And then he started lugging packages from his tent. A box containing a pet grooming vacuum cleaner,
*  two new radio-controlled model airplanes, dock-martons boots, boxes overflowing with flip flops,
*  printer cartridges, a sororily-and-blue spaghetti strap dress and a plastic sleeve.
*  The brother disappeared back behind the tarp door and the shorter detective called to him,
*  bring me the boxes, I know there's more shit in there.
*  Once the detectives were satisfied that they had what they'd come for, they loaded it all into
*  their unmarked cars and drove away. The man in the back of the patrol car was eventually driven
*  to a police station where he would spend the night in custody. Later, the detectives would look
*  up all the recovered loot on Amazon and tally up its total value, which exceeded the $950 minimum
*  required for a charge of felony grand theft in California. The Los Angeles County District
*  Attorneys Office declined to file a felony charge and referred the case to the City Attorney's Office,
*  which filed a misdemeanor instead. I left the encampment discombobulated by the mismatch between
*  the perpetrators, down and out men living intense, stealing goods someone else had already
*  nabbed and discarded, and the victim, a multinational company valued at more than $1.5 trillion.
*  The staff had been taken unlawfully, yes, but part of the reason these companies manufacture
*  items for so much less in Asia and then transport them thousands of miles in ships and trains and
*  trucks is so they don't have to pay the costs associated with adhering to environmental and labor
*  laws here. Also, I was flummoxed trying to imagine how a man living in a tent would go about selling a
*  stolen pet grooming vacuum cleaner. What even is a pet grooming vacuum cleaner?
*  On my last day in Los Angeles, I drove south in my rented Chevy Spark to take in the ports of Long Beach
*  and Los Angeles, which appeared on the horizon at sunrise as a single mega port,
*  enveloped in a particulate laden golden-colored haze. It was strangely beautiful and a little scary.
*  The closer I got, the more semi-trucks were rumbling past me in both directions.
*  Numerous trains, side by side, waited to be loaded on half a dozen parallel tracks.
*  Lines of trucks snaked around in no discernible pattern.
*  Stacks of chassies towered in fenced-off yards. Everywhere containers were in motion.
*  Massive gantry cranes reached out over ships to grab at steel boxes like hungry horses.
*  One human in a puny rental car can't take in the scale of the global supply chain,
*  but even this sliver of something so vast was enough to inspire all.
*  The four LAPD's cargo theft unit detectives had been scheduled that day to go undercover at a mall
*  and wander around stores pretending to be shoppers. Southern California had had a recent uptick of
*  what were being called flash mob robberies. The Versace store in the Beverly Center was hit
*  as was the Nordstrom in a mall in Canoga Park and an Eve Sandleraw in Glendale.
*  Videos from Southern California and elsewhere were going viral that showed people in black
*  ski masks, swarming stores, grabbing merchandise, jamming it into large garbage bags and fleeing.
*  The police department, along with other regional law enforcement agencies, now had a new organized
*  retail crimes task force. The detectives were setting up in anticipation of the next flash mob robbery.
*  I'd asked Alfonzo Lopez, former commanding officer of the commercial crimes division at the LAPD,
*  who until recently oversaw the cargo theft unit detectives. He is now assistant commander for
*  the operations South Bureau. How he thought the overall losses from these flash mobs compared
*  with the scale of theft from trains and trucks, he said cargo theft was bigger. But that didn't matter.
*  The viral flash mob videos had snagged in the city's psyche, in the country's psyche.
*  I pulled over into a dusty lot to listen to the low roar of the port and watch the trucks and trains.
*  Just one of these steel boxes contained more merchandise than a dozen flash mobbers could ever hold.
*  But the supply chain is hard to grasp fully with its anonymous looking containers rolling by,
*  giving away so little about their contents or destinations. Our collective gaze was shifting toward
*  the human drama we can see, focusing instead on videos of these young people dressed like ninjas,
*  running full tilt for the exit, stolen goods, spilling from their arms.
