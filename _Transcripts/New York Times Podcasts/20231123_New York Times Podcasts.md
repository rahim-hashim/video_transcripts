# Thanksgiving With 'The Run-Up': Are Black Voters Leaving Democrats Behind?

*  Hey, it's Michael.
*  First, a very happy Thanksgiving to you from everyone here at the Daily.
*  In addition to all of our listeners, one of the things we're very grateful for here at
*  the Daily is our colleagues at the Times across the newsroom and across the audio department.
*  And so this holiday weekend, we're going to be sharing a couple of episodes from other
*  shows here at the Times.
*  Today, we're going to hand things over to our colleagues at the run-up, a weekly show
*  about politics hosted by a steadhundan who brings us a very special and a very personal Thanksgiving
*  episode.
*  Take a listen.
*  Not to pick favorites, but Thanksgiving has always been my favorite holiday.
*  So when I thought about the show this week, there was only one place I knew it could
*  be.
*  Hi.
*  Hi.
*  Home.
*  Hey.
*  Well, this is Alisa.
*  This is Anna.
*  Hi.
*  You're from the run-up.
*  Hi.
*  And we're so excited.
*  So nice to meet you.
*  Come on in.
*  Hi.
*  Thank you so much.
*  I wanted to come home with my colleagues and microphones in tow to do the one thing you're
*  not traditionally supposed to do on Thanksgiving.
*  Talk politics at the dinner table.
*  Specifically, I wanted to ask my family and friends about one political question that's
*  recently been all over the news.
*  The changing relationship between Black voters and the Democratic Party.
*  The numbers are staggering in a new poll of battleground states from Sienna College and
*  the New York Times.
*  22% of Black voters that they would support Donald Trump over Joe Biden in a hypothetical
*  rematch in 2024.
*  It's compared to the 8% Trump carried nationally in 2020.
*  Now it's just one poll, but it comes after the 2022 midterms where Black turnout was one
*  of the Democrats' weakest points.
*  And anecdotally, it tracks what I see in my own life as Black people I grew up with,
*  especially younger Black people and Black men feel less and less tied to the Democratic
*  Party.
*  Some are more open to voting for Republicans or not voting at all.
*  So I decided to conduct a little focus group.
*  With a group of Black voters, I know very well.
*  What's the food?
*  Well, the food is turkey.
*  We have smother chicken, which is a traditional kind of a thing.
*  Smother chicken with mashed potatoes.
*  My mom and sisters prepare a feast.
*  And we also have a beef roast.
*  Low key, very low.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Just a little something slide, just a little turkey.
*  In a homemade dessert buffet for my sister Angelica.
*  Now I can take the pound cake and I can regen your molasses.
*  I'm curious about that.
*  That you have your eye on that?
*  Yeah.
*  Let's pray for the food.
*  Once my father bless the food.
*  Thank you, Lord, for a stay at the run-up.
*  Thank you for all of the family friends who are here tonight.
*  I pray you'll bless the food, sanctify a purifier for the nourishment of our bodies.
*  You turn the night over to me.
*  And keep them in Jesus' name, amen.
*  To play a role I was familiar with.
*  Yes, a reporter, but also the family instigator.
*  To ask a question that no one poll can answer.
*  Our black voters really souring on Democrats.
*  And if so, why?
*  From the New York Times, I'm a Steadhurndon.
*  This is the run-up.
*  We do a traditional thanks here at Thanksgiving.
*  We're grateful to God for another year.
*  And I want to take two minutes and you could just shout out one word or one sentence of what
*  you're thankful for because I know everybody in this room this year, something has
*  occurred in your lives that you are thankful for.
*  So I'm going to start us off and I'm going to take the generic one.
*  I'm thankful for life.
*  Thankful for life.
*  Thankful that I am seeing another year.
*  About 30 people showed up to this dinner.
*  I'm thankful to be serving.
*  Some friends, family, and people I've known forever through my dad's church.
*  I'm thankful for growth.
*  Growing and expanding.
*  I'm thankful for my right mind.
*  I grew up in the Southwest suburbs of Chicago in the town called Flossmore.
*  Around a lot of black families that were pretty similar to my own.
*  I'm thankful for life, health, strength, all of the above.
*  No class, college educated parents, black people who had left the city in search of something
*  better.
*  And not too far from my house.
*  My dad started a church, hollowly a temple.
*  I got one.
*  I'm thankful for peace.
*  It's a smaller congregation.
*  It's much less uniform in terms of class and education.
*  But it was always politically active.
*  And it's where I learned to talk about politics.
*  And ask questions about what people believe and why.
*  I'm thankful to see everybody here.
*  It's really amazing to see this collection of people.
*  And it really matters to me that you all are represented in what we're doing about the election.
*  Because this is a show that's about giving dignity to people.
*  And I think that's a value that you all taught me.
*  So thank you.
*  Most of the people here have been voting for Democrats their entire lives.
*  And some people remember a time when black people couldn't vote at all.
*  So I hope they could put this political moment in its necessary perspective.
*  So as folks grab their dinner, I set down at the dining room table.
*  Where their rose kind of melt in your mouth too though.
*  My plan was to divide people into groups that corresponded with divisions that we saw within
*  the poll.
*  I started with the group of older black folks, people who represent the demographic that
*  helped put Biden into office.
*  And that has largely stuck by him.
*  So while these folks are historically reliable democratic voters, I thought they could
*  still help us provide important context to what's been happening that's led to this point.
*  Would you all consider yourselves Democrats?
*  Why do you think black people have voted for Democrats and historically such high numbers?
*  I think one reason it seemed like, and this is only my opinion, when you look at the
*  Republican, it seems like they were in such a different bracket than what we were in.
*  What?
*  Uh, financially.
*  Seem like, you know, they were always on the top.
*  And Democrat doesn't mean that we're on the bottom though.
*  They just seem like they always seem so much higher than the Democrat.
*  They seem like Republicans care more about richer people.
*  And they are more concerned about staying rich and we stand where we are.
*  You know, it doesn't seem like they ever want us to get to the plateau that we meet where
*  they're at.
*  I think also on the Democratic Party, they have opened their arms to the point where
*  they may black folk feel that it's all inclusion.
*  Although we might not agree with everything that the Democratic Party stand for.
*  They don't discriminate against homosexuals or if you're poor or if you do have money,
*  it's more of a social thing where you talk about the Republican Party, it's about self.
*  And so it's like, how much more can I get?
*  It was the haven't had enough.
*  And so with Democrats, it was always, it was a whole new thing.
*  I think about Jesse Jackson, keep over live.
*  And so the Democratic Party has always been for black folk the possibility of doing something
*  if you will.
*  For you all, when you think about your time as a Democrat, what's the times the party has
*  made you the most proud?
*  A bomb.
*  A bomb.
*  A bomb.
*  And I think we all pull together.
*  That was the time that you really saw all of us as a race, pull together to get.
*  And we should be clear, we're in Chicago.
*  I mean, this was a place where it was specifically happening.
*  What did it feel like in 2008 when that was happening?
*  Do you remember how it felt for you?
*  It was like we were in control.
*  We were in power.
*  You know, yeah.
*  And when we go back to the Civil Rights Movement, then we saw like a fulfillment of all they
*  had worked for.
*  That's what it was.
*  You know, yes, all they had worked for, you know.
*  I remember you and I being the only ones at the church that thought he can win.
*  Yeah.
*  I put that on the record.
*  I was right early, y'all.
*  I can remember you and I arguing with your parents.
*  Yeah.
*  So they're like, he's not going to happen.
*  Black men, he's not going to happen.
*  I simply think it might.
*  And we would only two sand up.
*  He's going to win.
*  He's going to win.
*  And so I had to put that out there on the record.
*  I appreciate that for the record.
*  I believe he was going to win.
*  I mean, because everybody was pulling everybody to go to the pole.
*  This was the biggest turnout that we have ever, they said they were taking people off the
*  street.
*  You know, you got to go vote.
*  I'm wondering with Trump's election and the four years that came after that, did it
*  cause you to think differently about the Obama years before that or were those separate
*  events?
*  Those are separate.
*  I think it was separate.
*  You know, in 2016, one of the reasons it did happen is because you saw a big drop
*  off in some black turn out from 2012 to 2016.
*  Even the last recent midterms, one of the low points for the Democrats and what was
*  otherwise a pretty good year was that black people don't seem to have the same relationship
*  with the Democratic Party.
*  Do you think the relationship between black people and Democrats are changing or as Democrats
*  do you think maybe that's just one cycle or another, but this is a kind of connection
*  that will last?
*  I think it's about the generation that's, you know, doing the voting or not voting, you
*  know, and then you have to remember we were there, most of us, you know, doing the 70s
*  and the 60s, you know, and we were there watching all about, you know, the marches and everything.
*  And they don't really know about that.
*  It's not being taught in school.
*  Do you think that drop off in Democrats might be a generational thing?
*  Yes.
*  If there was an issue that matters to you that you want Democrats to deliver on, what is it?
*  Where you have the, of course, the economy, which they're looking out for and you have
*  crime and really, do you feel like they're looking out for that?
*  Well, I think that's the frustration.
*  Most of them they advocate for these particular issues, but the problem is you just don't
*  see much of any change and any results.
*  So that's what turns off a lot of people from politics that just give up because it's
*  apparently even though they vote, it seems like their vote is not making a difference.
*  So that's the struggle there.
*  So sometimes it's about pushing your agenda, letting people know what you're doing because
*  you have another voice on the other side.
*  Basically, they're screaming saying the Democrats are not doing anything and they scream
*  real loud and of course, the louder they scream, that's the voice we hear and ultimately
*  a lot of people believe that.
*  So the Democrats really have to do a better job of basically vocalizing what they're doing,
*  showing the results.
*  But to answer your question, yes, I believe they're making an effort, but everybody at this
*  table knows it's almost impossible to get anything done in Congress.
*  And that's where the fight is and that's what it is, basically a fight.
*  And if you don't have the patience to endure the fight, you give up.
*  But I think we have to encourage, you talk about generation, encourage the next generation
*  to stay in the fight.
*  One of the things that comes up as we talk to people is they feel less and less interested
*  in politics.
*  Do you feel people backing away from the fight?
*  It does feel like some of that is in the air.
*  I won't call names, but you talk to certain young people and they didn't even vote.
*  I say, how do you not vote in a presidential election?
*  I'm an election judge and I've been one for years and I could physically see where the
*  turnout was like no, and boy, you know.
*  And that was vote for young people and the older people that were not coming out to vote.
*  Yeah.
*  The question I had was, do you feel proud to be a Democrat?
*  Do you feel proud to be an American?
*  I'm proud of you, American.
*  You're a bad guy.
*  I feel like over the world, man.
*  I've been saying it's the best thing going on.
*  American.
*  Is everything great here?
*  No, could things be better?
*  Yes.
*  The seniors, the price gouges on the medicine and the rich are getting richer.
*  It's like how much money do you need?
*  Do I feel proud to be a Democrat?
*  I wish I could be a independent, you know, but we really don't have representation in
*  this region with independent.
*  So I have to go other.
*  I could never be a Republican, especially now because of anybody that supported Trump
*  in all the foolishness and lies that he told, no matter what your message is, like even
*  everybody on the ticket right now that's running, you all supported him.
*  And he lied openly and you believed the lie and you supported him and you backed him
*  with it.
*  So for me, you can never get anything from me because of that.
*  And so I can't say, I'm not going to say less or two evils, but I will not because of
*  people died for me to have this right.
*  I have to vote, you know, and so Democrat is the closest I can go.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, thank you so much.
*  We're going to talk to some more folks.
*  I'm really appreciate it.
*  What they're getting at, a sense that younger Black voters have been turning away from Biden
*  and the Democrats.
*  That supported in the data.
*  And that New York Times, Sienna, pulled Biden support among non-white voters under 45,
*  plummeted, a group that he carried by nearly 40 points in 2020.
*  He now led by just six.
*  This erosion is one of the biggest reasons Biden's numbers look so bad right now.
*  And it's giving hope to Republicans that they can win a greater share of Black voters
*  in 2024.
*  So just as people were going back for seconds.
*  I know a step from school, I guess.
*  I know a step from the church, but it's like family, you know.
*  Kind of grew up together.
*  His father is one of my mentors, yes sir.
*  I gathered a group of younger Black people at the same dining room table.
*  Would you all consider yourselves Democrats?
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Have you always considered yourself Democrats?
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  I'll ask this question, the same question I asked to kind of a older generation before
*  y'all.
*  Why do you think Black people vote in such numbers for the Democratic Party?
*  It's unique.
*  Like, among demographic groups in America, nobody votes for one party in this big of a
*  number.
*  Why do you think Black people vote for Democrats so consistently?
*  I think it's what you're taught kind of within your family that this is what you are.
*  And so you don't go anyway, different from it.
*  So you're like, my mom was a Democrat, so I'm going to be that without really looking
*  into the facts and finding out for yourself what you really want to be.
*  I do agree with Daniel.
*  This is like the household is Democrat.
*  But also there's a thought that, you know, like Black people are not Republicans.
*  It's just the bottom line.
*  And Republicans are for the rich people.
*  And you have all those tags among with being a Republican.
*  And it's all about money and not service.
*  This came up in the last one, too.
*  And I thought it was really interesting because sometimes you see Black folks say, I think
*  people vote for Democrats because Republicans are racist.
*  But that's not what the explanation you gave or the people last time.
*  It was that it's different rich people.
*  Yeah.
*  You think it's much more of a class thing than it is?
*  Yeah, it's beneficial to the higher class.
*  Those with more money.
*  I think the Democratic Party focuses more on our interests, the right to the Constitution
*  because we didn't always have rights.
*  So the Democratic Party seems to focus more with our interests.
*  You understand?
*  There's an understanding that Black people can lose rights.
*  And there's something about the Democrats that seem like they're at least safeguarding
*  someone.
*  And I think this is a thing I specifically wanted to focus on with this group.
*  And the last one we really talked about, the arc of civil rights movement through Obama
*  and how they feel that sense of pride.
*  I want to think about post Obama and what is that been in terms of shifting a relationship
*  or has it shifted in a relationship with Democrats?
*  I think about that high point of 2008, the hope for younger folks especially.
*  Do you still feel like that?
*  I don't know, I've been let down by Obama.
*  Do you hear me?
*  I've been heavily...
*  Why?
*  Why?
*  I feel as though he could have did more for us.
*  I feel as though he specifically Chicagoans.
*  That's where he come from.
*  And I'm just saying, you know, Trump and all that he did is like, man, Obama, you could
*  have did the same thing.
*  You could have been wrong, too, before you were people.
*  And the fact that he did not do it or even spoke towards doing it was disheartening.
*  And the fact that a lot of the mentees that I got trying to push them too vote to even
*  vote anymore.
*  Like the young people that I'm trying to push to start back voting was upset at the movement
*  of Obama.
*  They stopped voting altogether.
*  They lost faith in the political system.
*  There is a kind of unspoken thing about Obama era.
*  I think it's kind of especially true in Chicago that it wasn't meeting some of expectations.
*  But it's especially spoken in this group and it's not spoken in the last group, right?
*  They speak about just the dignity of him in office, about the power of having a black
*  family in that place.
*  I hear differently from younger people is a, okay, what else?
*  And that's not what I hear from you.
*  What is the else?
*  Democrats talk about blackness a lot more.
*  They talk about race a lot more.
*  That's not, it's not clear to me that that's like what people want, but is it?
*  I don't know.
*  But they definitely say the words more.
*  I mean, if you have like pandrian and talking about hot sauce in your bag, you know, I
*  think if you're being like real injured, I think people like him pick up on it.
*  It's like, yes, you want to know that your interest is heard.
*  But then I don't kind of like maybe bite.
*  And I think that was a lot of people's gripe that like he was kind of just maybe like
*  pandrian.
*  And then like when he was in office, it was like, okay, I got your vote.
*  But then you know, went to worlds.
*  I mean, it's talked about more, which is fine.
*  You know, and so now the issue is before us.
*  But we're still taking a lot of else in a lot of areas with, with violence, police,
*  even education.
*  So it's, yeah, we're talking about it.
*  But then what?
*  Because in this case, we're still on the losing end.
*  If not in a worse state than before when it wasn't talking about because now that it's
*  talked about, we're losing some of the ground that civil rights move again for us.
*  So I just think they're talking about it.
*  Yeah, it's good.
*  But now what?
*  As a follow up to the first question, it's about why do you think black people vote for
*  Democrats in such numbers?
*  Do you think that's changing?
*  I mean, the same part.
*  I think the relationship between the black people and the parties changes.
*  The sad part about it is, yes, even on my job, like these younger, like, so you have more
*  of black people that are on their own business, their entrepreneurs.
*  And so the benefit, the dare scene is that always helping me financially.
*  And so, you know, yes.
*  And so, you know, what have they done for me?
*  You know, the Republican Party can give me these tax cuts and give me this and give me
*  that.
*  It boils down to like those type of issues.
*  And then they look at the Democratic Party and they're like, well, Biden, I mean, look
*  at this, we got all these immigrants.
*  He ain't doing this.
*  He ain't doing that, but it's always the plus for the Republican side because it's benefiting
*  them tangibly.
*  My fear is that a lot of young Democrats are leaning towards Republican because of the
*  financial gain that they got during the pandemic, of course.
*  And yeah, those checks, thank you.
*  But my fear is the blindfold to what really is happening, like affirmative action.
*  No one's saying anything about that.
*  Nothing ears from now, we're going to feel that.
*  You're going to see that in these jobs.
*  You're going to see all of that.
*  But if we don't say anything about that now, you know, that'll be a problem.
*  Not so hard for like the affirmative action thing, but I think it kind of like goes to your
*  point though too and like explaining because like that change through like the Supreme Court.
*  So like you kind of have to educate like the young people as well, like that process.
*  So then they're not once again disappointed in like our demo.
*  Right.
*  Or student loans, right?
*  And then they talk down by the Supreme Court, but there's a lot of people holding it against
*  Biden that he didn't make student loans go away.
*  Right.
*  And but inviting like he kind of ran on that.
*  But I think maybe that's how he got a lot of the players who were like, oh, student
*  loans.
*  But then we all of us like didn't actually like, okay, we, it could get blocked.
*  And like what power does he really have?
*  And then so a lot of people are disappointed by them because of that.
*  They're like, if he runs again, I still have tons of student loan debt.
*  So he's not in my zone.
*  Yeah.
*  And not everybody in this room, but we are more so about self.
*  And what is it going to do for me?
*  And so when they're looking at these candidates, it's really like, how do I benefit this instead
*  of like what Chris said, thinking about 10 years from now, how this will affect us.
*  We're thinking about how this is going to affect me right now.
*  And right now it feels good because I got money in my pocket.
*  But now here we are three years later and prices for gas and milk are $20.
*  So we didn't think about how this would affect us later on.
*  We just thought, oh, this feels good now.
*  Joe Biden is 80 years old.
*  He's running for reelection.
*  The I get how I get that like, I get the options of the choice.
*  I'm saying, how do you feel about that?
*  I don't know because not I don't know.
*  It makes me think about if something were to happen, then who am I looking at as next
*  in life?
*  So then it's like, you know, because so it brings it to reality.
*  I mean, the interesting thing for me is I had this whole plan, right?
*  I had this plan of, okay, Biden can be Trump.
*  Biden will run for one term and then Kamala would be next in life.
*  And it didn't happen that way.
*  Kamala didn't Kamala didn't.
*  Kamala didn't.
*  She didn't break it.
*  She did.
*  That's it.
*  That's it.
*  You know, everything is this real uncomfortable lamp at the end of every statement.
*  And it just part of it, part of it is that she wasn't used correctly and part of it is
*  who she is.
*  But you thought Biden will be one term and he was setting up the next generation.
*  I was not prepared for to be back here.
*  I was not prepared.
*  I was like an impossible thought.
*  We would never see Biden and Trump again.
*  We just kind of thought we needed Biden for that moment.
*  He was our best shot of competing or beating Trump.
*  Specific to progressives, you know, like we think of the Bernie's of the world.
*  You think of the kind of national progressive leaders.
*  They've really struggled to win over black people.
*  What is it about progressive politics that has somehow at least at the top levels, not
*  fully mixed with black communities?
*  I think because a lot of black people are religious and that's where a lot of us say, be more
*  specific.
*  What do you mean?
*  Okay, let's say women who want to have abortion, you know, progressive beliefs that that's
*  what you can do.
*  But there are a lot of black people that don't believe that's wrong.
*  The Bible say that's wrong.
*  But you're taking away their power to choose.
*  God didn't even do that to you.
*  So for you to take away their power to choose, you just as wrong as them, you're being
*  God to them.
*  You know, we're in the same boat with this perspective, especially when you get to abortion.
*  And it's like people are absolutely shocked to believe that I am saying that the woman
*  should have a choice.
*  Like, it's like, can you be saved and say this?
*  Absolutely.
*  Because to your point, Chris, we all have choice.
*  Now I'm not saying I believe in it.
*  I'm not saying that I, you know, think it's right.
*  But you got a choice to make.
*  If it's Trump versus Biden again, do you know how you evolve?
*  So, so how I devote right now in this, I am very, very torn.
*  I, you know, I cannot vote for Trump.
*  You know, I cannot, you know, and face tomorrow and wake up and feel like I'm a person, a human.
*  I can't do that.
*  But also voting for Biden, it also brings concern, you know, to my life as well.
*  That's my thing.
*  Biden?
*  Yeah, absolutely Biden.
*  I'm going with Biden.
*  I'm with Chris.
*  I cannot do Trump.
*  I would go for Biden as well.
*  I probably would not vote for either.
*  I don't want either one.
*  So it's like, it's not to vote at all.
*  But it's like, am I going to vote for someone who I absolutely don't want and then vote
*  for someone who I really don't want either.
*  But what's the alternative?
*  What is it I'm going to say?
*  They are, but it won't be because of me.
*  But let's go.
*  So it's going to be because of a plethora of you.
*  Do you feel like you're a Democrat more because of what Democrats do or more because of
*  what Republicans do?
*  Oh, because of what Republicans do.
*  I'm going to be sorry.
*  That's a good one.
*  I probably more because of what Republicans do.
*  And I don't know what Democrats do.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the closest we'll get to pride.
*  More after the break.
*  At this point in the evening, the turkey was picked clean.
*  People were loading up on Angelica's bounty of desserts.
*  And at least in a typical year, it was the time of night when the board games would
*  come out.
*  And my mom would challenge me to a game of parches.
*  But this year, I was up to something.
*  And before everyone left, I wanted to have two more discussions about Black voters in
*  2024 to explore another division that's clear in the polling table.
*  So we're doing a gender split as our last combo.
*  So the men are going to stick around here and then we're going to have Black women in
*  the other group.
*  Gender.
*  While there's significant drop off between young and old Black voters in terms of political
*  engagement, what truly alarms national Democrats is the current trend line when it comes to
*  Black men specifically.
*  And that poll of battleground states, 27% of Black men supported Donald Trump.
*  An incredibly high number for a Republican primary candidate.
*  And considering Trump's struggles with traditional swing voters, like moderates and independence,
*  is ability to appeal to groups that don't typically vote Republican, like Black men,
*  matters a ton.
*  So I wanted to gather the Black men in the House and have an honest discussion about what
*  might be behind those numbers and whether they think they'll hold.
*  Can I raise if you consider yourself a Democrat?
*  So that's about one, two, three, four, five, six side of the nine of us.
*  Would you consider yourself a Republican?
*  One, would you consider yourself an independent?
*  I think the pin on the issue.
*  Depend on the issue.
*  Okay, so we got two.
*  For drew you to rail, you said you're a Republican.
*  Have you always been a Republican?
*  Always.
*  Always.
*  What makes you a Republican?
*  What made you a Republican?
*  Like generally, I think those things vary by state.
*  For us, you know, I'm saying, why would I vote against myself in my community and where
*  I'm from, the Republican Party does a lot for Black people and a lot for business.
*  Where are you from?
*  In the United States.
*  So as a state that has Republicans in power, has to have Republicans in power for a long
*  time.
*  You're saying that leads you to be more interested in voting for Republicans?
*  Absolutely.
*  Why would I vote against myself or vote against my interests?
*  One of the reasons we wanted to convene this group specifically is when you look at polling
*  data right now, there's some fear among Democrats that this could be an election where there's
*  a bigger drop off among Black men specifically when it comes to Democrats.
*  I'm curious, what do you think it is?
*  What's the connection?
*  Why are Black men more open to Republicans, you think, than Black women?
*  The financial mobility, the Republican Party preaches somewhat of this concept of just
*  drop up your bootstraps and Canada will your own way to make your own way far as financially.
*  The financial mobility that they say that's out there, I think that appeals to more men
*  in like a distant franchise that want to take another step financially within their
*  community.
*  So you're telling me that I can be a business owner.
*  You can give me the steps to be there.
*  I can be more efficient.
*  I can have more economic wealth in my own community.
*  That is appealing to some people.
*  I think that's kind of a reason that there might be appealing to them.
*  Another thing is that I honestly feel that the Democratic Party has forgot about the
*  Black male.
*  What I mean by that is that one of the major demographics that we have is the African-American
*  women, they're amazing.
*  They're very strong.
*  They come out to the polls.
*  But as African-American men, sometimes we get left like our needs, our desires, our
*  wants and our always in the count.
*  We kind of get pushed to the side.
*  I think sometimes that might be something that men are looking at that our needs are
*  not being taken care of, like our matters are not being resolved.
*  I mean, Democrats say in nearly every speech now, Black women are the bed rocks of democracy
*  or there needs to be specific focus on them as the anchors of the party.
*  I mean, I heard you say that you think that like sometimes the downstream of that can
*  feel like Black men are absent.
*  Do the rest of you all feel like Black men are?
*  Why are we looking for the Democratic Party or any kind of party to give you validation?
*  Why do you need these things?
*  You are a man, bro.
*  If you want to feel a certain way or you want to do something to know you clearly, if
*  you want to make money, then you should do it.
*  I always want to be spoken to, though, right?
*  Like, that's not unique to Black men, right?
*  That's not unique to one specific group.
*  Voters want politicians to speak to those concerns.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  That's the poor idea of politicians.
*  My job is to make money so I could buy my way or what I want.
*  I don't want to ask you or you to tell me what I think.
*  I want to pay you to speak for what I think.
*  Yeah, very good.
*  I also wanted to tag on to a lot of Black men, Democrats do not cater to men because the
*  squeaky world get the oil.
*  We don't talk often.
*  We don't speak up.
*  We don't say anything.
*  You know, women say they, I don't know.
*  I mean, I can't get this raise.
*  They speak up.
*  So of course, they're going to cater to who's going to speak up.
*  And the number ratio towards women versus men is, you know, who will you spend more of
*  your money to cater towards?
*  You're going to cater towards the women.
*  There's also been a big change in how the Democratic Party talks about gender and sexuality
*  and other issues over the last five, six years, right?
*  A Me Too movement has completely upended language around gender and gender roles.
*  A embrace of kind of LGBTQ rights about transgender identity has changed the way the party talks
*  about certain issues.
*  Do you think that that has shifted the party's relationship with Black men?
*  Yes.
*  It is.
*  You know, this reality of it, especially in the inner cities, you know, we have a lot of
*  people that can't pull themselves up, whether whatever the circumstances were.
*  So we have a lot of Black men are essentially zombies in their neighborhoods.
*  And so with a lack of wisdom and knowledge to get to that point, you know, they're not
*  even in the picture.
*  And then some that are in the picture, they feel that they're left out because the reality
*  of it is when you look at the homosexual movement or LGBTQ or however you want to put it,
*  the reality of it is they get more equity than Black men in some cases.
*  But part of that is because of the movement that they have and at base.
*  And so they base make noise.
*  And so if we collectively got together, perhaps, you know, we can make that noise.
*  But unfortunately, sometimes we can't get together for whatever reason.
*  You know, it's like 10 churches on one street in the same neighborhood.
*  And collectively, we can't work together to do God's mission.
*  You know, I think the zombie point is interesting.
*  That makes me think about, you know, obviously joblessness, criminal justice.
*  If there was a specific issue that you think matters most to Black men, what would you
*  think that is?
*  I think it's a mass generalization.
*  I know.
*  Trust me.
*  I know.
*  I'm saying this.
*  If we could think, what would you think about like if there was an issue that someone
*  could speak to that you think would resonate?
*  Economic empowerment will be one of the primary things, but also spiritual enlightenment.
*  And when I say that, I'm speaking specifically to coming to a knowledge of who we are, what
*  our design is based upon the biblical understanding of truth and manhood.
*  Because manhood, I do think we have to fight for manhood.
*  Because it's being pulled away and redefined by all these different groups.
*  And I do believe that Black men, we have to take our voice back and not be passive and
*  be more deliberate and particularly Christian Black men, being very deliberate about discipleship,
*  but also economic empowerment.
*  I think those two things are critical for us.
*  Well, let me ask then about the current figures, right?
*  One about Trump and specific to his appeal or lack of appeal, maybe to Black men, but
*  Trump is someone who's done more outreach to Black men specifically, whether that be,
*  you know, first step act and kind of criminal justice reform openness, whether that be, you
*  know, hitting up every rapper who's ever lived.
*  But I mean, the man talks more explicitly about Black men than any Republican I've ever
*  known.
*  And he's getting a response for it too.
*  Do you feel like that?
*  A lot of stuff that a lot of Black men may be going towards Trump now is because what
*  he said, he did.
*  His word was his bond.
*  And that's a lot of men's value.
*  When he said he was doing Obama ran, ran because he was Black and saying all this Black
*  stuff.
*  But when he took office, oh, he can't do that no more.
*  Because it's spicy, Chris.
*  But you ran from that and you got you won because of that.
*  But when you got there, you couldn't do that.
*  So what did he say that he was going to do that he actually he did.
*  Who?
*  Uh, Trump.
*  They didn't have the oil.
*  I think that's a good thing.
*  No, I ain't saying the word.
*  I think that's like a word.
*  I don't actually about the value judgment of what he did.
*  It's the fact that it's a person willing to do what they say they do.
*  And now I want to add this one more point.
*  Under Trump's administration, I found a whole lot of Black men starting businesses.
*  Yeah, but you understand I had nothing to do with truck.
*  Oh, I just had nothing.
*  No, no.
*  That's, that's what.
*  That's what that's what Republican, whenever there's a Republican in charge, they, they,
*  they, they, they, they they get rid of the regulations.
*  That's always.
*  That's always.
*  That's the, that's the, that's the, you gotta get them a job.
*  Democrat if Obama does absolutely.
*  Flies.
*  No.
*  Only the first time.
*  It would be really funny when that only first five.
*  Did you move from George?
*  No.
*  One thing we haven't talked about is kind of wars globally.
*  That's kind of in the last month has really taken up
*  a bunch of the space.
*  And one of the ways it's really affecting domestic politics
*  is Joe Biden is going to ask Congress for close to $100
*  billion for Ukraine, for Israel.
*  And a place that you see him having trouble kind of
*  pitching that is among black communities, right?
*  Like that there is less support sometimes for that amount
*  of money going abroad.
*  Quickly, I'm curious like black men and black people
*  have been a very domestic focused electorate, right?
*  How, with what is happening globally right now?
*  How does that impact the way you think about next year's
*  election?
*  And what do you think about the prospect of how much money
*  America spends to countries abroad?
*  Because people like Donald Trump are going to make that
*  America first.
*  That's going to be one of those arguments that he's laying out.
*  I agree.
*  It should be.
*  As the war is not a broad, not America first.
*  That's a fine answer.
*  I should be saying.
*  I'm saying, I'm saying.
*  So right now, when you're talking about allocating
*  hundreds of millions of dollars to Ukraine and Israel,
*  and yet, when you have all these folks coming across the border
*  and you go right there, right down the street to Chicago,
*  where you have people in the police departments and all that.
*  And unfortunately, sometimes our government,
*  whether it's Democratic Republic,
*  we don't take care of home base.
*  We have a lot of places how they can put those ones
*  and help folk out.
*  But right now, the focus is over there.
*  And I think you can do, you can multitask.
*  Unfortunately, we're not.
*  I encourage us to take the stance of the airlines.
*  Put your mask on first and then go and help somebody else
*  put their mask on.
*  Because here's the deal.
*  If you don't put your, you will not survive.
*  If we don't take it on, if we pay all this money
*  to all these people, eggs gonna be $25, you know,
*  a perk, we don't create anything.
*  Who is that gonna affect the most?
*  We don't create anything.
*  We don't affect black people anymore.
*  Okay, let's get back to Biden.
*  What's the word on Biden?
*  He's too old.
*  And we talk about the negatives of Trump often,
*  but we don't talk about the negatives of Biden
*  in a world of today's politics,
*  where most policies are written by think tanks
*  and groups of people.
*  Biden hand wrote a policy that resulted in more black people
*  being locked up than ever in the history of America.
*  Like, I mean, just...
*  For Donald Trump to succeed next year,
*  specifically when we talk about black men,
*  he basically needs like one out of four,
*  25% black men, who will vote to vote for him?
*  Do you think that's possible?
*  Yeah.
*  I'm not gonna lie to him.
*  I think the chair's gonna slide him there.
*  He's gonna say,
*  he's gonna press it up.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it's gonna be, I think it's durable,
*  but I don't think he's gonna get to take it.
*  If he can't do that, I really am.
*  He's gonna go, yeah.
*  So I think he can get 25% there.
*  Just work with, work for, first question.
*  Just work with me that he's the nominee.
*  Just let's assume he's the nominee.
*  Yes, assume he is.
*  Assume as he's the nominee.
*  So you think that Trump can win one out of four black men?
*  Yeah, there's two factors.
*  One is the economic factor in terms of him
*  pushing for entrepreneurial and all those type of things.
*  The other thing is that he's dealing with straight men.
*  He's not pushing the gay agenda openly,
*  and that's another elephant in the room
*  when it comes to brothers, you know?
*  And so he has two things working for him
*  that will appeal to one out of four.
*  That is the elephant in the room.
*  Trump's ability to appeal to some black male voters
*  isn't just about Trump.
*  It's also about masculinity itself.
*  And the ways that change norms around gender and sexuality
*  are reshaping the political landscape.
*  Earlier in the week, I told my mom,
*  I wanted to focus on this in my conversations.
*  And she pointed out that to only seek the perspective
*  of black men without talking to black women
*  would be a real oversight.
*  And I agree.
*  And not just because you should always listen to your mother.
*  So while I was speaking to the group of men
*  in the dining room,
*  I'm just thinking free roaming with the mic.
*  So I'm gonna try to come up to you.
*  My colleague, Alisa, spoke to a group of about 15 black women,
*  including my mom and sisters,
*  about their own political power.
*  We carry the weight of a lot.
*  And politicians know it, right?
*  That if we're voting, we're turning the tides on.
*  Oftentimes we're that extra, whatever percentage,
*  I will take that particular candidate over the top to win.
*  The way that responsibility can be a burden.
*  Although men are still having the difficult time voting.
*  Yeah, not, yeah.
*  But when they come, it just seems like we're still fumbling.
*  And not us fumbling, but the same issues are before us.
*  And so black women have had to shoulder that.
*  And I don't think that we shoulder it like we're
*  shouldering it.
*  I just think we do it.
*  We just do what we do.
*  And that's all.
*  And there if you want a question,
*  we've been asking everyone all night.
*  We're particularly interested to
*  and like black men who decide to vote for Trump.
*  And I guess what do you all think is the appeal there?
*  Do you get it?
*  Do you not get it?
*  What do you think is the reason that they're vote?
*  You know, you have the black men who makes it,
*  who's the CEO, who's successful.
*  And then the things that Trump stands for
*  financially benefits them.
*  So then that's the black man that's voting for Trump.
*  The black man that has an experience.
*  I don't think that's the only black man.
*  That's voting for Trump at all.
*  I don't think so.
*  But that's one of them.
*  You can go ahead.
*  I think, so if you say uneducated,
*  because we're uneducated, I think that's the thing.
*  That's it, right?
*  That when you think about the lived experience
*  with women and men,
*  there was a burdening.
*  There was a show during that we had to do,
*  but we got education, right?
*  We also think once we talk about the fairness of this country,
*  in my approximation,
*  I think that the problem is,
*  we believed the gendered lie
*  that a man would be up here.
*  And that women do what they do.
*  And I think that maybe we propped up the belief
*  that as a man, you would have certain advantages, maybe.
*  And that hasn't happened for black men.
*  And I do think that it's created a question
*  of what do I do in this moment?
*  And Trump is very demonstrative against women
*  in a way that affirms manhood, right?
*  And so again, if you're feeling like you're discarded
*  and nothing's working for you,
*  that's gonna appeal, that language,
*  is really gonna appeal to you.
*  But I think the more insidious part of it
*  is that I think it really is the juxtaposition of the life,
*  you women had it.
*  You know, you're making money.
*  You're doing all things that I could never do, right?
*  And so I know that on the higher end,
*  but I think when anyone white or black makes money,
*  they want that tax break.
*  I have not met CEO who don't want a tax break.
*  That's right.
*  So I don't know, we could just put it on just black men
*  who make money.
*  But I think that when you mitigate and talk about,
*  take away education, take away just privileges.
*  And that's working, right?
*  Those are things that we're able to do as women
*  in a way that just hasn't happened
*  in an equitable sense, right?
*  So it's literally the competition of things.
*  And I think that, you know,
*  I think black men, when we, black mothers,
*  we maybe gave wrong lessons to the children
*  because I think it's this idea that I was as a man,
*  I was supposed to have this.
*  This is what I was, oh, this is what I was due.
*  That was your brother told.
*  That's what you were saying.
*  The other thing that you'll hear him say all the time,
*  him being Trump is, you know,
*  even if he has all his, you know, different litigation issues,
*  he'll say, they're coming after me and they're coming.
*  No, and not just that they will.
*  By way of coming after me, they're coming after you.
*  When they attack me, they're attacking you
*  that definitely maybe pulls on the desires
*  of becoming for some black men.
*  And if this man is saying,
*  this powerful man is saying, I've got you.
*  You know, I understand that they have not been there for you
*  and I, and you see how they're attacking me,
*  that's how they're attacking you.
*  And I'm gonna stop them from attacking me
*  and that'll also stop them from attacking you.
*  I'm always scared to say it, but less educated,
*  but if you are not astute,
*  if you're not educating yourself,
*  then what he says becomes golden.
*  Yeah.
*  I think even just like on a simpler level,
*  like when he ran on like make America great again,
*  I think not just on like race and gender,
*  that whole slogan to me was almost like,
*  people wanting to get there like, so-called power back.
*  And so the Nessa Black woman is like, race wise,
*  what do you mean make America great?
*  Like what time period are you talking about?
*  Because in the 50s, I don't want to go for me.
*  And then even for me, like you were saying like,
*  we now have like done so much.
*  And so like if you are the man who's like, actually like,
*  I thought it was being a different place.
*  And I see my woman counter part.
*  I'm trying to make America great again too.
*  Reversa time and get my back perfect.
*  So I hear like that it seems like in this case,
*  like why you seem Black men voting for Trump
*  is that it comes from a place of self interest
*  of wanting to step from your perspective.
*  And like, you know, choosing the thing that they think
*  is going to like best benefit them, I guess.
*  Like I'm wondering who you will see as like
*  the strongest advocates for Black women.
*  For Black women?
*  No one needs to be right.
*  Right.
*  Ourself.
*  Ourself.
*  Ourself.
*  Our women are advocates for them safe.
*  I like to watch that.
*  Because we talked about like, I'm going to like,
*  but you're name Kamala.
*  We talked about her and like, I think people thought
*  something more for me.
*  Like I don't, I don't know if Black women saw
*  like that was her.
*  I don't, I don't have the answer to that.
*  But I wonder like when we talk about that, like if we saw her.
*  I can't believe she had that pearls and gym shoes thing
*  and you saw all women from sororities coming together
*  with their pearls and their chucks and they thought,
*  they were like, oh, we've got someone that looks like us
*  and they're again and they were hoping like we say,
*  well, Obama, they were expecting her to do so much.
*  And we've seen nothing.
*  And so now it's like, who speaks for us?
*  I think people were thinking that she would be it
*  and that's why we voted.
*  So I honestly think she helped them pull that thing
*  because there was no way without it.
*  And so now that we don't have what we expected,
*  it's kind of like, okay, well, there goes that.
*  What's next?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I think that when we talk about men,
*  whether black or white, I think that the thought
*  of Kamala Harris being the president is easy to see
*  while it's that black men could be going towards Trump
*  because the thought even when we deal with Biden in his age
*  and the thought is, okay, if something does happen,
*  then this is going to be our president.
*  I think that thought will drive many men black or white.
*  At this point, I walked over from the dining room
*  to listen to what was being said.
*  I also wanted to know what they thought of the question
*  I posed to the group of men.
*  So next year, and next year for Trump
*  to basically achieve his black male goals,
*  he needs to win one out of four.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  One out of four, if he wins 25 to 30% of black men
*  will be the highest rate of any Republican in modern history.
*  Do you think he can win one out of four black men?
*  Yeah, at this moment.
*  Yeah, that's scary to say.
*  We have a lot of praying to do.
*  Ah.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know that I can.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  Soon after that conversation, we ended the night.
*  People started grabbing leftovers, packing them in tin foil,
*  and saying goodbye with laughter and hugs.
*  I hadn't seen some of these people in a long time.
*  And over the next couple days, I heard from several of them
*  who told me that they felt grateful to be part of the experience.
*  I felt thankful for them.
*  They're willing to play ball with my questions, their candor,
*  for celebrating my favorite holiday a little early.
*  I was like, can you take a few, but take a few.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  And of course, forgiving Angelica and excuse.
*  I have Christmas, pinwheel, coconut macaroons,
*  to bake 13 different desserts.
*  Fruit filled, shortbread, regular shortbread,
*  pumpkin macaroons, cinnamon, shortbread,
*  lemon poppy seed shortbread,
*  pound cake, ginger molasses, cookies, chocolate,
*  chip cookies, Oreo cheesecake, which is going to be like the triumph
*  and a peacom brittle.
*  Did I say walnut brownie?
*  OK.
*  LAUGHTER
