*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernici, and this is the Daily.
*  The posturing between the US and China has been intensifying in recent weeks, especially
*  when it comes to Taiwan.
*  Today, my colleague Edward Wong on why China is so fixated on Taiwan, and how the US got
*  in the middle of it.
*  It's Monday, April 17th.
*  So Ed, Taiwan has been back in the news again for the past few weeks.
*  Tell us why.
*  Well, Sabrina, we saw tension spike this month over Taiwan.
*  Earlier this month, the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, stopped in Los Angeles on her
*  way back to Taiwan from Central America.
*  I want to thank Speaker McCarthy for his warm hospitality.
*  She went to the Reagan Library in Southern California and met with House Speaker Kevin
*  McCarthy.
*  The friendship between the people of Taiwan and America is a matter of profound importance
*  to the free world.
*  This infuriated the people's Republic of China.
*  Today China is condemning House Speaker Kevin McCarthy for hosting the president of Taiwan
*  at the Reagan Library.
*  We don't only see any form of diplomacy, even informal diplomacy, taking place between
*  Taiwanese officials and US officials.
*  And they announced the start of military exercises around Taiwan.
*  On the Taiwan Strait, China's Shandong aircraft carrier launched 80 fighter jet missions
*  and 40 helicopter flights.
*  This is the latest in the kind of surge intentions that happens periodically and that has taken
*  place in recent years.
*  The drills came with an ominous warning.
*  China's military is ready to fight.
*  Right, it feels like we're in this cycle where Taiwan does something pretty minor and
*  China reacts.
*  And this brings up a question a lot of us here at the Daily Have Had, which is why is China
*  so fixated on Taiwan?
*  Well, this is a conflict that dates back a century.
*  And it permits Chinese national informed policy and the question of Chinese nationalism.
*  And there are a lot of ways that you could tell the story, but there's a handful of moments
*  that really define it.
*  And I would start with what many people see as the root of the modern fixation and that
*  arose in the late 1940s.
*  Once again, crisis comes to China, whose teaming millions now ask a single question, what does
*  the future hold?
*  So at that time, there was a civil war raging in China between the nationalist party, also
*  known as the Guamindong and the Congress.
*  The nationalists have been ruling China for many years under an authoritarian system.
*  And their leader is Shanghai Shad.
*  Now many Chinese saw this party as corrupt and as serving only the interests of the elite.
*  And they were eager to have a new type of government.
*  And at that time, Mao Zedong was leading the communist and the communist army in a fight
*  against the nationalists.
*  Now the communist leader Mao Zedong is winning one victory after another.
*  And many people in the countryside, as well as some students, intellectuals and workers
*  in the cities, were joining his cause and willing to fight against the nationalists.
*  Red Maral was high and above all, they knew what they were fighting for.
*  The civil war raged on for years and eventually the communist army got the upper hand.
*  Mao Zedong declared the Chinese people's revolutionary war has now reached a 10 point.
*  And in October of 1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of
*  China in Beijing.
*  The rid of China's face and the world's largest country within the communist empire.
*  And so the nationalists had to flee.
*  And they left mainland China and went to the island of Taiwan off the southeast coast
*  of China.
*  General Chen Kai-shek returns to power as president of nationalist China.
*  He takes office in exile at Formosa, island fortress, 90 miles from the Chinese mainland.
*  And then once they settled down on the island in 1949, they went about refashioning their
*  government and their society on the island.
*  And they claimed that they were still the legitimate government of China.
*  After their disastrous defeat of the hands of the communists, the nationalists have started
*  a new from scratch.
*  And what did that look like, Ed?
*  So the government that the nationalists set up on Taiwan looked very much like the government
*  that they had been running on mainland China.
*  For example, on Taiwan, they had officials who they said were leaders of provinces in
*  China.
*  They had different offices running what they said were places like Mongolia and Tibet
*  in China.
*  And they also had some of the most sacred symbols of the O-China.
*  They have brought treasures from the forbidden city, accumulated by previous dynasties and
*  brought them to Taiwan.
*  So both in governance and in culture, they were saying that they were essentially China.
*  Like Taiwan in its own telling was a fully fledged version of China in exile, right down
*  to the most sacred objects of Chinese history.
*  That's right, Sabrina.
*  And this is very important.
*  They said there are aspirations, be to one day depose the communists and reestablish
*  control over China.
*  So you can see why communist China would be annoyed by this, right?
*  Like a renegade China that effectively lost the civil war, sets up shop right next
*  door and claims that it is the real China.
*  Well, Sabrina, they're more than just annoyed.
*  Mao sees this as an important unfinished part of the civil war and he has intentions to
*  conquer Taiwan and take it back into China.
*  Okay.
*  So effectively, you have two different parties saying that they are the real China and each
*  side says it wants to take the other side.
*  That's right.
*  And how does the world handle this weird situation of two China's?
*  Well, some nations decide to recognize the people's republic of China, but the United States
*  actually supports Taiwan as the legitimate government of China.
*  And why does the US do that?
*  Well at this point, the Americans were engaged in the Cold War through trying everything
*  they could to hold back the Soviet Union and contain the spread of communism in the world.
*  So they didn't want to recognize the Chinese Communist as the legitimate government.
*  And so they decide that Taiwan, even though it's an authoritarian government, should be the
*  legitimate ruler of China.
*  And this US support of Taiwan continued for many years.
*  But then in the 1960s, something started to change.
*  Remember the Cold War was very complicated.
*  In the Southeast Asia, the Americans were fighting the war in Vietnam against the Vietnamese
*  Communists who were backed by the Soviet Union and by China.
*  And by 1971, the war was going poorly for the United States.
*  And President Nixon and his aid thought that they could improve diplomatic ties with China,
*  the maybe they could get the Chinese Communist to withdraw their support from the North Vietnamese
*  and the Soviets.
*  And that would hasten the end of the war in Vietnam.
*  So basically swallowed their dislike for one communist regime in an effort to contain
*  the other and on the chance that it might end this disastrous war they were engaged with.
*  That's exactly right.
*  And in addition to the urgent problem of the Vietnam War, Nixon and his aid were also beginning
*  to recognize the potential power of China.
*  And they think that the country could be an important partner if they take the right diplomatic
*  steps.
*  So what does Nixon do?
*  In 1971, Nixon sent his aid, Henry Kissinger, on a secret trip to China to start having
*  talks with Chinese officials on reopening diplomatic ties.
*  Shortly after Kissinger's secret visit, Nixon announces that he himself will make a trip
*  to Beijing.
*  There can be no stable and enduring peace without the participation of the People's Republic
*  of China and its 750 million people.
*  And in 1972, he travels there.
*  East meets West as a handshake bridges 16,000 miles and 22 years of hostility.
*  He goes to the Great Wall.
*  The president said one would have to conclude that this is in fact a Great Wall built by
*  great people.
*  And he speaks with Mao Tadeem.
*  Get the summit face to face, two leaders who directed Destiny of one out of three persons
*  on the Earth.
*  It's a huge, Earth-shaking event in diplomatic relations around the world.
*  So Nixon here is switching sides, I mean, effectively reversing decades of American foreign
*  policy.
*  Yes.
*  And this begins a new chapter in U.S.-China relations and in world diplomacy.
*  The actions of the U.S. government that began under Nixon culminated in 1979.
*  The United States of America and the People's Republic of China have agreed to recognize each
*  other and to establish diplomatic relations as of January 1st, 1979.
*  When President Carter formally establishes diplomatic recognition of the Communist-run
*  government in Beijing as the legitimate government of China.
*  The government of the United States of America acknowledges the Chinese position that there
*  is but one China and Taiwan is part of China.
*  And he officially cuts off diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
*  OK, so at this point, Communist China gets what it wants, right?
*  Well, not exactly, Sabrina.
*  President Carter did give China a big part of what it wanted, which was diplomatic recognition
*  of its government.
*  But Carter also put the question of Taiwan aside.
*  Beijing wanted the U.S. to acknowledge that Taiwan was ruled by China.
*  But what Carter did was a very complicated, evasive maneuver.
*  He said in his own words that the U.S. acknowledges China's position, that there is one China and
*  that Taiwan is part of it.
*  But that doesn't mean that the U.S. endorsed that position.
*  There was an explicitly supporting Beijing's idea that it was the ruler of Taiwan now.
*  It just said it knew how Beijing felt about the situation.
*  And that's the foundation of what the U.S. caused its one China policy.
*  So this is a real act of political jiu jitsu on the part of the United States, right?
*  I mean, Carter saying to Beijing, we recognize that you think Taiwan is part of China.
*  We hear you.
*  But we're not saying that we agree.
*  That's exactly right.
*  So Carter left the U.S. government's position on Taiwan's status intentionally big.
*  And that would have far reaching consequences in the coming decades.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Ed, you said that the U.S. left its position toward Taiwan ambiguous intentionally.
*  How does that play out?
*  So when Carter makes this announcement, formally establishing diplomatic ties with China,
*  not everyone in the U.S. is enthusiastic about it.
*  And some lawmakers in Congress are not happy with the recognition of Beijing and this loss
*  for Taiwan.
*  They want to protect Taiwan in case the Chinese Communist Party ever tried to make a move
*  against it.
*  So in 1939, the same year that the Carter administration formally established diplomatic ties with China,
*  Congress passes this legislation called the Taiwan Relations Act.
*  It essentially commits the U.S. to protecting Taiwan in certain ways without saying explicitly
*  that its military would come to Taiwan's defense.
*  This act says that the U.S. must give weapons of a defensive nature to Taiwan.
*  It says that it must maintain a capacity to defend Taiwan if there's coercion.
*  And it says that it will work to make sure that any friction or tensions over Taiwan are
*  resolved peacefully.
*  Doesn't that seem to run counter to the U.S. diplomatic efforts toward China?
*  Because China and the U.S. have just spent the entire decade of the 1970s hammering out
*  diplomatic relations, right?
*  And now if China takes any military action against Taiwan, this new condition basically
*  says that the U.S. might take action to defend Taiwan.
*  That's right.
*  And it creates this deep mistrust between the rulers and Beijing on the one hand and the
*  U.S. and Taiwan on the other hand.
*  And then the coming decades, something happens within Taiwan that makes China even more upset.
*  So remember, the original nationalist leaders in Taiwan had the singular focus on retaking
*  China.
*  And then you had these newer generations of people in Taiwan who were born on the island,
*  who had never been to China, and who had no interest in claiming ownership of China.
*  They were really more interested in their identity as Taiwanese people and in governing
*  themselves in Taiwan.
*  And in the 1990s, there was this ground floor support throughout the island for the leaders
*  to install a new political system.
*  Taiwan wanted a democracy and they wanted multiple parties and general elections.
*  So, up until this point, Taiwan has basically seen its future as connected to China.
*  But now Taiwan in a way is striking out on its own, which is probably very threatening
*  to China, right?
*  Right.
*  And of course China is watching this very carefully.
*  And this push for democracy culminates in the first democratic presidential election in
*  1996.
*  For people in Taiwan, this is their proudest moment.
*  The Taiwanese elected their first native foreign president, Lee Donghui, president Lee
*  Swift, a victory with almost 54% of the vote.
*  Coming as China is trembling because of our democracy, Lee Donghui tells the crowd
*  and calls China's aging leaders, lock heads.
*  And his decisive victory and leadership style sent a message to Beijing.
*  Lee and the Taiwanese people were saying that while Taiwan wasn't going to openly claim
*  to be independent country, it would push the boundaries and edge away from this idea
*  of one China.
*  So how does China react?
*  Well, of course the communist leaders are anxious.
*  On the Chinese mainland, the communist leadership is not just fuming over the democratic frenzy
*  on Taiwan, they've literally gone ballistic.
*  Their biggest action came in the months before and then around the election.
*  When China took a very aggressive step and shot missiles into the waters around Taiwan,
*  China's military exercises serve notice to Taiwan that independence is not an option.
*  And then the US seized this and it responds by sending warships to the area around Taiwan
*  to tell Beijing to back off.
*  Our purpose in being here is to demonstrate the presence and commitment of the United States
*  to peace and stability in the region.
*  With two US naval battle groups now in the South China Sea, the war of nerves intensify.
*  So this is at US policy of look but don't touch.
*  Right.
*  And some people say that this moment was the first big test in this three-way dynamic
*  that the US established with its policies on Taiwan.
*  And this is a type of action and reaction involving military forces that becomes a defining
*  pattern in relations in the coming years.
*  Right.
*  The pattern is that China has this unfinished business with Taiwan and it's frustrated
*  by the role of the United States and each country is responding to the others' moves with
*  Taiwan in the middle.
*  That's right.
*  And this sense of impending conflict has gotten a lot higher in recent years, especially
*  because we've seen a more aggressive leader emerge in China.
*  Xi Jinping, the current leader of China, has made some very bold statements on Taiwan.
*  Xi Jinping took power in 2012.
*  He said that the problem of Taiwan cannot be passed on from generation to generation.
*  And for some people that suggests that Xi might make some bold and decisive move on
*  Taiwan in the near future to resolve that issue.
*  And then in the US, you also have this transition from President Obama to President Trump, who
*  is a lot more confrontational with China.
*  Right.
*  Trump campaigned on how he was going to be tough on China.
*  That's exactly right.
*  So for example, after Donald Trump won the election 2016, officials who worked under President
*  Trump took a much more assertive position on China and they really framed US-China relations
*  as an intense competition and pushing out any room for cooperation between the two nations.
*  By the end of the Trump administration, they were trying to figure out ways to strengthen
*  Taiwan and the government there as a bulwark against China.
*  In other words, China and the United States are both more aggressive in this moment.
*  That's exactly right.
*  And we've seen the Biden administration continue to take assertive actions around the Taiwan
*  straight.
*  Biden officials have continued sending warships through the straight as a signal to Beijing.
*  And President Biden himself has said four times now that he will have the US military defend
*  Taiwan if China were to try and take military action against the island.
*  So at this point in the story, it almost seems like the US is just as fixated on Taiwan
*  as China is.
*  Why?
*  Well, I think there's several reasons for that, Sabrina.
*  Some US national security officials think Taiwan is an important strategic point to contain
*  China.
*  So, for example, they want to make sure that the Chinese military cannot extend its reach
*  beyond Taiwan and into other island chains in the far Pacific.
*  And they think that as long as Taiwan remains autonomous and has robust military forces,
*  it'll be difficult for China to do that.
*  So an important check on China's military power?
*  Exactly.
*  And US officials also have begun to realize the importance of Taiwan in the global economy.
*  At this point, Taiwan has the world's most advanced semiconductor industry.
*  And as you know, these chips that their companies make are used in everything from appliances
*  in our household to the most advanced military systems that the United States and other countries
*  deploy around the world.
*  So the US sees the Taiwanese semiconductor industry as something that must protect and
*  it views it as a sector that China cannot get its hands on.
*  So Ed, when we started this conversation over Taiwan, the big question was, who was the
*  real China?
*  But what you've laid out here is really much broader than that, right?
*  I mean, Taiwan has come to represent much more for the US and China.
*  It's really come to symbolize this battle between the two superpowers over military power
*  or the economy.
*  I mean, it really feels like it contains the fate of the future of the world in a lot of
*  ways.
*  Sabrina, when I talked to US officials here in Washington, they also speak about it in
*  these very high stakes terms.
*  And some of them are openly speculating on whether the US and China will end up fighting
*  a war over Taiwan in the coming years.
*  But no one wants that war.
*  When you look at the actions that the US and China are taking, you can tell that they want
*  to make sure they don't cross that line.
*  They'll move up to the edge, but they're not willing to take that next step.
*  And where does all of this leave Taiwan?
*  Well, of course, the Taiwanese don't want war over their island.
*  So even today, you see Taiwan's leaders trying to very carefully calibrate their actions.
*  We saw that recently when House Speaker Kevin McCarthy met with President Tsai Ing-wen
*  in Southern California.
*  President Tsai could have invited him to Taiwan, but she chose to meet with him on US
*  soil instead.
*  I suspect that she knew that Beijing would see this as a less provocative action.
*  And she appears to have been right.
*  We saw how the Chinese reacted.
*  They sent warships and airplanes around the Taiwan Strait, but that was a much less intense
*  military action than other things they'd done in the recent past.
*  So Taiwan was kind of just testing the line, right, engaging how far it could go without
*  provoking the full fury of China?
*  Yes.
*  And I think President Tsai's calculation is an example of the tightrope that Taiwanese
*  leaders and citizens have walked for decades.
*  It's interesting because I would think that Taiwan would be in a pretty vulnerable position,
*  but you're talking about Taiwan as having agency.
*  Yeah, in many ways, it's counterintuitive, Sabrina.
*  Many people think of Taiwan as this tiny island of 23 million people living in the shadow
*  of China.
*  And it's true that Beijing has taken steps to diplomatically isolate them from much of
*  the world.
*  But the Taiwanese see themselves as being much more than a pawn in a geopolitical contest
*  between superpowers.
*  And despite all the pressure on them, they've managed to build an important economy over
*  the years.
*  They've created a new government and they put democracy into practice.
*  And they managed to avoid armed conflict over their island through all these decades.
*  So when I talk to Taiwanese officials and citizens these days, many of them tell me that
*  the fate of the island is really in their hands.
*  Ed, thank you.
*  Thanks, Sabrina.
*  It's always great to talk to you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what El Toshit know today.
*  Over the weekend, Sudan descended into violence, with street battles raging for control of
*  Hartoom, the capital.
*  Four years ago, Sudan was an inspiration to the world when its citizens toppled a widely
*  detested ruler, Omar El Bashir.
*  The revolution faltered 18 months ago when the military seized power in a coup.
*  The military was supposed to hand back power to civilian leaders this week.
*  Instead, two generals, each commanding different factions of the armed forces, are now battling
*  each other for control of the country.
*  Scores of people have been killed in the fighting, and hundreds injured.
