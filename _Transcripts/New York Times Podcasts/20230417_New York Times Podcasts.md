# China and Taiwan: A Torrid Backstory
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJX-uf8omE)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  The posturing between the U.S. and China has been intensifying in recent weeks, especially
*  when it comes to Taiwan.
*  Today, my colleague Edward Wong on why China is so fixated on Taiwan and how the U.S. got
*  in the middle of it.
*  It's Monday, April 17th.
*  So, Ed, Taiwan has been back in the news again for the past few weeks.
*  Tell us why.
*  Well, Sabrina, we saw tension spike this month over Taiwan.
*  Earlier this month, the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, stopped in Los Angeles on her
*  way back to Taiwan from Central America.
*  I want to thank Speaker McCarthy for his warm hospitality.
*  She went to the Reagan Library in Southern California and met with House Speaker Kevin
*  McCarthy.
*  The friendship between the people of Taiwan and America is a matter of profound importance
*  to the free world.
*  This infuriated the People's Republic of China.
*  Today, China is condemning House Speaker Kevin McCarthy for hosting the president of Taiwan
*  at the Reagan Library.
*  They don't see any form of diplomacy, even informal diplomacy taking place between Taiwanese
*  officials and U.S. officials.
*  And they announced the start of military exercises around Taiwan.
*  On the Taiwan Strait, China's Shandong aircraft carrier launched 80 fighter jet missions and
*  40 helicopter flights.
*  This is the latest in the kind of surge in tensions that happens periodically and that
*  has taken place in recent years.
*  The drills came with an ominous warning.
*  And his military is ready to fight.
*  Right.
*  It feels like we're in this cycle where Taiwan does something pretty minor and China reacts.
*  And this brings up a question a lot of us here at The Daily have had, which is why is
*  China so fixated on Taiwan?
*  Well, this is a conflict that dates back a century and it permeates Chinese national
*  and foreign policy and the question of Chinese nationalism.
*  And there are a lot of ways that you could tell the story, but there's a handful of moments
*  that really define it.
*  And I would start with what many people see as the root of the modern fixation.
*  And that arose in the late 1940s.
*  Once again, crisis comes to China, whose teeming millions now ask a single question, what does
*  the future hold?
*  So at that time, there was a civil war raging in China between the Nationalist Party, also
*  known as the Guomindang and the communists.
*  In the spring of 1947, the communists exploded in a series of quick offensives which left
*  the nationalist garrisons in Manchuria dazed and confused.
*  The Nationalists have been ruling China for many years under an authoritarian system.
*  And their leader is Chiang Kai-shek.
*  Now many Chinese saw this party as corrupt and as serving only the interests of the elite.
*  And they were eager to have a new type of government.
*  And at that time, Mao Zedong was leading the communists and the communist army in a fight
*  against the Nationalists.
*  Now the communist leader, Mao Zedong, is winning one victory after another.
*  And many people in the countryside, as well as some students, intellectuals and workers
*  in the cities, were joining his cause and willing to fight against the Nationalists.
*  Red morale was high and the bubble then knew what they were fighting for.
*  The civil war raged on for years and eventually the communist army got the upper hand.
*  Mao Zedong declared, the Chinese people's revolutionary war has now reached a turning point.
*  And in October of 1949, Mao Zedong proclaims the founding of the People's Republic of China in Beijing.
*  The Reds have changed the face of China and brought the world's largest country within the communist empire.
*  And so the Nationalists had to flee and they left mainland China and went to the island
*  of Taiwan off the southeast coast of China.
*  General Chiang Kai-shek returns to power as president of Nationalist China.
*  He takes office in exile at Formosa, island fortress, 90 miles from the Chinese mainland.
*  And then once they settled down on the island in 1949, they went about refashioning their
*  government and their society on the island.
*  And they claimed that they were still the legitimate government of China.
*  After their disastrous defeat at the hands of the communists, the Nationalists have started anew from scratch.
*  And what did that look like, Ed?
*  So the government that the Nationalists set up on Taiwan looked very much like the government
*  that they had been running on mainland China.
*  For example, on Taiwan, they had officials who they said were leaders of provinces in China.
*  They had different offices running what they said were places like Mongolia and Tibet in China.
*  And they also had some of the most sacred symbols of the old China.
*  They had brought treasures from the Forbidden City, accumulated by previous dynasties, and
*  brought them to Taiwan.
*  So both in governance and in culture, they were saying that they were essentially China.
*  Like Taiwan, in its own telling, was a fully-fledged version of China in exile, right down to the
*  most sacred objects of Chinese history.
*  That's right, Sabrina.
*  And this is very important.
*  They said their aspiration would be to one day depose the communists and reestablish
*  control over China.
*  So you can see why communist China would be annoyed by this, right?
*  Like a renegade China that effectively lost the Civil War sets up shop right next door
*  and claims that it is the real China.
*  Well, Sabrina, they're more than just annoyed.
*  Mao sees this as an important unfinished part of the Civil War, and he has intentions to
*  conquer Taiwan and take it back into China.
*  Okay, so effectively you have two different parties saying that they are the real China,
*  and each side says it wants to take the other side.
*  That's right.
*  And how does the world handle this weird situation of two Chinas?
*  Well, some nations decide to recognize the People's Republic of China, but the United
*  States actually supports Taiwan as the legitimate government of China.
*  And why does the U.S. do that?
*  Well, at this point, the Americans were engaged in the Cold War.
*  They were trying everything they could to hold back the Soviet Union and contain the
*  spread of communism in the world.
*  So they didn't want to recognize the Chinese communists as the legitimate government.
*  And so they decide that Taiwan, even though it's an authoritarian government, should be
*  the legitimate ruler of China.
*  And this U.S. support of Taiwan continued for many years.
*  But then in the 1960s, something started to change.
*  Remember, the Cold War was very complicated.
*  In Southeast Asia, the Americans were fighting the war in Vietnam against the Vietnamese
*  communists who were backed by the Soviet Union and by China.
*  And by 1971, the war was going poorly for the United States.
*  And President Nixon and his aides thought that if they could improve diplomatic ties
*  with China, then maybe they could get the Chinese communists to withdraw their support
*  from the North Vietnamese and the Soviets.
*  And that would hasten the end of the war in Vietnam.
*  So basically swallowed their dislike for one communist regime in an effort to contain the
*  other and on the chance that it might end this disastrous war they were engaged with.
*  That's exactly right.
*  And in addition to the urgent problem of the Vietnam War, Nixon and his aides were also
*  beginning to recognize the potential power of China.
*  And they think that the country could be an important partner if they take the right diplomatic
*  steps.
*  So what does Nixon do?
*  In 1971, Nixon sent his aide Henry Kissinger on a secret trip to China to start having
*  talks with Chinese officials on reopening diplomatic ties.
*  Shortly after Kissinger's secret visit, Nixon announces that he himself will make a trip
*  to Beijing.
*  There can be no stable and enduring peace without the participation of the People's
*  Republic of China and its 750 million people.
*  And in 1972, he travels there.
*  East meets West as a handshake bridges 16,000 miles and 22 years of hostility.
*  He goes to the Great Wall.
*  The president said one would have to conclude that this is, in fact, a Great Wall built
*  by great people.
*  And he speaks with Mao Zedong.
*  At the summit, face to face, two leaders who direct the destiny of one out of three persons
*  on the earth.
*  It's a huge earthshaking event in diplomatic relations around the world.
*  So Nixon here is switching sides, I mean, effectively reversing decades of American
*  foreign policy.
*  Yes.
*  This begins a new chapter in US-China relations and in world diplomacy.
*  And the actions of the US government that began under Nixon culminate in 1979.
*  The United States of America and the People's Republic of China have agreed to recognize
*  each other and to establish diplomatic relations as of January the 1st, 1979.
*  When President Carter formally establishes diplomatic recognition of the communist-run
*  government in Beijing as the legitimate government of China.
*  The government of the United States of America acknowledges the Chinese position that there
*  is but one China and Taiwan is part of China.
*  And he officially cuts off diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
*  Okay, so at this point, communist China gets what it wants, right?
*  Well, not exactly, Sabrina.
*  President Carter did give China a big part of what it wanted, which was diplomatic recognition
*  of its government.
*  But Carter also put the question of Taiwan aside.
*  Beijing wanted the US to acknowledge that Taiwan was ruled by China.
*  But what Carter did was a very complicated evasive maneuver.
*  He said in his own words that the US acknowledges China's position that there is one China and
*  that Taiwan is part of it.
*  But that doesn't mean that the US endorsed that position.
*  Carter wasn't explicitly supporting Beijing's idea that it was the ruler of Taiwan now.
*  It just said it knew how Beijing felt about the situation.
*  And that's the foundation of what the US calls its one China policy.
*  So this is a real act of political jiu-jitsu on the part of the United States, right?
*  I mean, Carter saying to Beijing, we recognize that you think Taiwan is part of China.
*  We hear you.
*  But we're not saying that we agree.
*  That's exactly right.
*  So Carter left the US government's position on Taiwan's status intentionally big.
*  And that would have far reaching consequences in the coming decades.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Ed, you said that the US left its position toward Taiwan ambiguous intentionally.
*  How does that play out?
*  So when Carter makes this announcement, formally establishing diplomatic ties with China, not
*  everyone in the US is enthusiastic about it.
*  And some lawmakers in Congress are not happy with the recognition of Beijing and this loss
*  for Taiwan.
*  They want to protect Taiwan in case the Chinese Communist Party ever tried to make a move
*  against it.
*  So in 1979, the same year that the Carter administration formally establishes diplomatic
*  ties with China, Congress passes this legislation called the Taiwan Relations Act.
*  It essentially commits the US to protecting Taiwan in certain ways without saying explicitly
*  that its military would come to Taiwan's defense.
*  This act says that the US must give weapons of a defensive nature to Taiwan.
*  It says that it must maintain a capacity to defend Taiwan if there's coercion.
*  And it says that it will work to make sure that any friction or tensions over Taiwan
*  are resolved peacefully.
*  Doesn't that seem to run counter to the US diplomatic efforts toward China?
*  Because China and the US have just spent the entire decade of the 1970s hammering out diplomatic
*  relations, right?
*  And now, if China takes any military action against Taiwan, this new condition basically
*  says that the US might take action to defend Taiwan.
*  That's right.
*  And it creates this deep mistrust between the rulers in Beijing on the one hand and
*  the US and Taiwan on the other hand.
*  And then the coming decade, something happens within Taiwan that makes China even more upset.
*  So remember, the original nationalist leaders in Taiwan had the singular focus on retaking
*  China.
*  And then you have these newer generations of people in Taiwan who were born on the island,
*  who had never been to China, and who had no interest in claiming ownership of China.
*  They were really more interested in their identity as Taiwanese people and in governing
*  themselves in Taiwan.
*  And in the 1990s, there was this ground-solid support throughout the island for the leaders
*  to install a new political system.
*  People wanted a democracy and they wanted multiple parties and general elections.
*  So up until this point, Taiwan has basically seen its future as connected to China.
*  But now, Taiwan, in a way, is striking out on its own, which is probably very threatening
*  to China, right?
*  Right.
*  And of course, China is watching this very carefully.
*  And this push for democracy culminates in the first Democratic presidential election
*  in 1996.
*  For people in Taiwan, this is their proudest moment.
*  The Taiwanese elected their first native-born president, Lee Deng-hui.
*  President Lee swept a victory with almost 54% of the vote.
*  Communist China is trembling because of our democracy, Lee Deng-hui tells the crowd.
*  He calls China's aging leaders blockheads.
*  And his decisive victory and leadership style sent a message to Beijing.
*  He and the Taiwanese people were saying that while Taiwan wasn't going to openly claim
*  to be an independent country, it would push the boundaries and edge away from this idea
*  of one China.
*  So how does China react?
*  Well, of course, the communist leaders are anxious.
*  On the Chinese mainland, the communist leadership is not just fuming over the democratic frenzy
*  on Taiwan.
*  They've literally gone ballistic.
*  Their biggest action came in the months before and then around the election, when China took
*  a very aggressive step and shot missiles into the waters around Taiwan.
*  China's military exercises serve notice to Taiwan that independence is not an option.
*  And then the US sees this and it responds by sending warships to the area around Taiwan
*  to tell Beijing to back off.
*  Our purpose in being here is to demonstrate the presence and commitment of the United
*  States to peace and stability in the region.
*  With two US naval battle groups now in the South China Sea, the war of nerves intensified.
*  So this is that US policy of look, but don't touch.
*  Right.
*  And some people say that this moment was the first big test in this three-way dynamic that
*  the US established with its policies on Taiwan.
*  And this is a type of action and reaction involving military forces that becomes a defining
*  pattern in relations in the coming years.
*  Right.
*  The pattern is that China has this unfinished business with Taiwan and it's frustrated
*  by the role of the United States.
*  And each country is responding to the other's moves with Taiwan in the middle.
*  That's right.
*  And this sense of impending conflict has gotten a lot higher in recent years, especially because
*  we've seen a more aggressive leader emerge in China.
*  Xi Jinping, the current leader of China, has made some very bold statements on Taiwan.
*  In 2012, he said that the problem of Taiwan cannot be passed on from generation to generation.
*  And for some people, that suggests that Xi might make some bold and decisive move on
*  Taiwan in the near future to resolve that issue.
*  And then in the US, you also have this transition from President Obama to President Trump, who
*  was a lot more confrontational with China.
*  Right.
*  And he campaigned on how he was going to be tough on China.
*  That's exactly right.
*  So for example, after Donald Trump won the election in 2016, officials who worked under
*  President Trump took a much more assertive position on China.
*  And they really framed US-China relations as an intense competition and pushing out
*  any room for cooperation between the two nations.
*  By the end of the Trump administration, they were trying to figure out ways to strengthen
*  Taiwan and the government there as a bulwark against China.
*  In other words, China and the United States are both more aggressive in this moment.
*  That's exactly right.
*  And we've seen the Biden administration continue to take assertive actions around the Taiwan
*  Strait.
*  Biden officials have continued sending warships through the Strait as a signal to Beijing.
*  And President Biden himself has said four times now that he will have the US military
*  defend Taiwan if China were to try and take military action against the island.
*  So at this point in the story, it almost seems like the US is just as fixated on Taiwan as
*  China is.
*  Why?
*  Well, I think there's several reasons for that, Sabrina.
*  Some US national security officials think Taiwan is an important strategic point to
*  contain China.
*  So for example, they want to make sure that the Chinese military cannot extend its reach
*  beyond Taiwan and into other island chains in the far Pacific.
*  And they think that as long as Taiwan remains autonomous and has robust military forces,
*  it'll be difficult for China to do that.
*  So an important check on China's military power.
*  Exactly.
*  US officials also have begun to realize the importance of Taiwan in the global economy.
*  At this point, Taiwan has the world's most advanced semiconductor industry.
*  And as you know, these chips that their companies make are used in everything from appliances
*  in our household to the most advanced military systems that the United States and other countries
*  deploy around the world.
*  So the US sees the Taiwanese semiconductor industry as something that must protect and
*  views it as a sector that China cannot get its hands on.
*  So Ed, when we started this conversation over Taiwan, the big question was, who was the
*  real China?
*  But what you've laid out here is really much broader than that, right?
*  I mean, Taiwan has come to represent much more for the US and China.
*  It's really come to symbolize this battle between the two superpowers over military
*  power over the economy.
*  I mean, it really feels like it contains the fate of the future of the world in a lot of ways.
*  Sabrina, when I talk to US officials here in Washington, they also speak about it in
*  these very high stakes terms.
*  And some of them are openly speculating on whether the US and China will end up fighting
*  a war over Taiwan in the coming years.
*  But no one wants that war.
*  When you look at the actions that the US and China are taking, you can tell that they want
*  to make sure they don't cross that line.
*  They'll move up to the edge, but they're not willing to take that next step.
*  And where does all of this leave Taiwan?
*  Well, of course, the Taiwanese don't want war over their island.
*  So even today, you see Taiwan's leaders trying to very carefully calibrate their actions.
*  We saw that recently when House Speaker Kevin McCarthy met with President Tsai Ing-wen in
*  Southern California.
*  President Tsai could have invited him to Taiwan, but she chose to meet with him on US soil instead.
*  I suspect that she knew that Beijing would see this as a less provocative action.
*  And she appears to have been right.
*  We saw how the Chinese reacted.
*  They sent warships and airplanes around the Taiwan Strait.
*  But that was a much less intense military action than other things they've done in
*  the recent past.
*  So Taiwan was kind of just testing the line, right?
*  Gauging how far it could go without provoking the full fury of China.
*  Yes.
*  And I think President Tsai's calculation is an example of the tightrope that Taiwanese
*  leaders and citizens have walked for decades.
*  It's interesting because I would think that Taiwan would be in a pretty vulnerable position.
*  But you're talking about Taiwan as having agency.
*  Yeah, in many ways, it's counterintuitive, Sabrina.
*  Many people think of Taiwan as this tiny island of 23 million people living in the shadow
*  of China.
*  And it's true that Beijing has taken steps to diplomatically isolate them from much of
*  the world.
*  But the Taiwanese see themselves as being much more than a pawn in a geopolitical contest
*  between superpowers.
*  And despite all the pressure on them, they've managed to build an important economy over
*  the years.
*  They've created a new government and they put democracy into practice.
*  And they managed to avoid armed conflict over their island through all these decades.
*  So when I talk to Taiwanese officials and citizens these days, many of them tell me
*  that the fate of the island is really in their hands.
*  Ed, thank you.
*  Thanks, Sabrina.
*  It's always great to talk to you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  Over the weekend, Sudan descended into violence, with street battles raging for control of
*  Khartoum, the capital.
*  Four years ago, Sudan was an inspiration to the world when its citizens toppled a widely
*  detested ruler, Omar al-Bashir.
*  The revolution faltered 18 months ago when the military seized power in a coup.
*  The military was supposed to hand back power to civilian leaders this week.
*  Instead, two generals, each commanding different factions of the armed forces, are now battling
*  each other for control of the country.
*  Scores of people have been killed in the fighting and hundreds injured.
