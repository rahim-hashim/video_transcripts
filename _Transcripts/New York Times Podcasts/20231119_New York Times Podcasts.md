*  Hi, my name is John Gertner. I'm a contributor to the New York Times magazine, and I write about
*  science and technology. This week's Sunday read is a story I wrote for the magazine's space
*  issue about the space force. It's the newest, smallest, and most secretive branch of the U.S.
*  military. It was established just four years ago, and its members, they're called guardians,
*  are in charge of observing and protecting everything that belongs to America that's orbiting above
*  the Earth. That includes defending military satellites, and all the satellites we sometimes take for
*  granted that are vital to our day-to-day lives. Unlike, say, the Air Force or even the Coast Guard,
*  you won't see photos of its planes and ships in service. And because so much of its work is out of
*  sight, the space force has almost become this caricature. There's even a Netflix comedy series about it,
*  starring Steve Carell. The operating costs for the space force amount to about $26 billion a year.
*  And I don't think it's uncommon to hear questions like, well, why do we need to spend so much to
*  protect our satellites? Or are these threats to our satellites real or imagined? But picture life
*  without GPS, without mapping and directions, or without weather satellites, which are entire agricultural
*  systems depend on. Our lives are tied very intimately to what's happening in space. And so I want
*  to find out what does this new branch of the military actually do? And how do they do it?
*  So, after approaching the space force and explaining the premise of my story, they agreed to give me
*  some access that I think they don't ordinarily offer. In Colorado, I visited the Peterson and Shrever
*  bases, which were formerly used by the Air Force. I also went to a place called Space Systems
*  Command in Los Angeles, not far from LAX. Most of the time, there was a great veil of secrecy
*  over what the Guardians were doing. At Peterson, I couldn't bring any electronic devices into the
*  buildings. I could only go old school and use a notebook. There were some people I couldn't quote by
*  name. And sometimes I'd enter a room and it would need to be vacated before I could walk through it.
*  And I'd have to pass through quickly. But I did uncover a lot in my reporting about how
*  and why the Space Force operates, which you'll hear about in my story. One of the most striking
*  things to me was this. I've always thought of space as a place of wonder and delight and endless
*  curiosity. But the Space Force Guardians, in their own words, consider space to be a contested,
*  congested war-fighting domain. This military branch of about 15,000 people has to prepare for a war
*  in space, even as they do everything they can to prevent a war in space. It's this delicate
*  balancing act between security and the kind of arms race we've entered into with Russia and China.
*  And they have to make sure they don't overstep it. So here's my article. What does the US Space Force
*  actually do? Red by Eric Jason Martin.
*  Chief Master Sergeant Ron Lurch of the US Space Force sat down in his office in Los Angeles one
*  morning in September to deliver a briefing known as a threat assessment. The current threats in space
*  are less sci-fi than you might expect, but there are a surprising number of them, at least 44,500
*  space objects now circle Earth, including 9,000 active satellites and 19,000 significant pieces of debris.
*  What's most concerning isn't the swarm of satellites, but the types. We know that there are
*  kinetic kill vehicles, Lurch said, for example a Russian nesting doll satellite, in which a big
*  satellite releases a tiny one and the tiny one releases a mechanism that can strike and damage
*  another satellite. There are machines with the ability to cast nets and extend grappling hooks too.
*  China, whose presence in space now far outpaces Russia's, is launching unmanned space planes into orbit,
*  testing potentially unbreakable quantum communication links and adding AI capabilities to satellites.
*  An intelligence report, Lurch said, predicted the advent within the next decade of satellites with
*  radio frequency jammers, chemical sprayers and lasers that blind and disable the competition.
*  All this would be in addition to the cyber warfare tools, electromagnetic instruments and ASAT,
*  anti-satellite missiles that already exist on the ground. A Lurch's assessment space looked
*  less like a grand new ocean for exploration, phrasing meant to induce wonder that is
*  lingered from the Kennedy administration and more like a robotic battlefield, where the conflict
*  raging on Earth would soon extend ever upward. The Space Force, the sixth and newest branch of the
*  US military, was authorized by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump in December 2019.
*  Its creation was not a partisan endeavor, though Trump has boasted that the idea for the organization
*  was his alone. The initiative had in fact been shaped within the Armed Forces and Congress
*  over the previous 25 years, based on the premise that, as satellite and space technologies evolved,
*  America's military organizations had to change as well. At its incarnation,
*  the Space Force was an assemblage of programs and teams that already existed, mainly as entities
*  within the Air Force. It's one of the common misperceptions that it caused money to create the
*  Space Force, and it really didn't, because we already had Space Forces, Todd Harrison of the
*  Center for Strategic and International Studies, told me, these were just spread throughout the military.
*  The people, the bases, the platforms, the satellites, the ground stations. What the new directive
*  did accomplish, however, was to group space endeavors under a central chain of command and
*  authorize its leaders to chart a unified future. One of the things that we were lacking without a
*  Space Force was an organization that would argue for its own destiny, Douglas Leverro, a former
*  Pentagon official involved in helping start the branch, told me. The concern was that without a
*  dedicated team within the military's bureaucracy that could push for the specific tools they needed,
*  the United States would be at a disadvantage. Some strategists worried that the nation already was.
*  Leverro pointed out that two decades ago, a Chinese military analyst named Wang Hu Cheng
*  wrote a paper that presaged an aspect of China's aerospace strategy, for countries that can never
*  win a war with the United States by using the method of tanks and planes, attacking the US space
*  system may be an irresistible and most tempting choice. The argument identified space as the US
*  military's soft ribs and strategic weakness. From the start, the Space Force had detract
*  Air Force officials wondered if it was necessary, while some political observers believed that
*  it signified the start of a dangerous and expensive militarization of another realm.
*  What seemed harder to argue against was how nearly every aspect of modern warfare and defense,
*  intelligence, surveillance, communications, operations, missile detection has come to rely on
*  links to orbiting satellites. The recent battles in Eastern Europe, in which Russia has tried to
*  disrupt Ukraine's space-born communication systems, are a case in point. And yet, the strategic
*  exploitation of space now extends well beyond military concerns. Satellite phone systems have
*  become widespread, positioning and timing satellites such as GPS, now overseen by the Space Force,
*  allow for digital mapping, navigation, banking and agricultural management. A world without
*  orbital weather surveys seems unthinkable. Modern life is reliant on space technologies to
*  an extent that an interruption would create profound economic and social distress.
*  The work of the Space Force is by its nature highly sensitive, often classified and mostly out of
*  sight. This leaves the organization in a battle for visibility and at times viability.
*  Some members of the Force, Guardians, as they're called, told me that even now they find themselves
*  bumping into members of other branches of the military who see their arm patches and ask
*  in earnest space force. Is that a real thing? The Steve Carell Netflix comedy series,
*  which members of the actual Space Force sometimes argue is neither good nor funny,
*  doesn't help their cause. It likewise doesn't capture their seriousness of purpose.
*  For the moment, the Force has taken up a problem not often contemplated outside science fiction.
*  How do you fight a war in space or a war on Earth that expands into space? And even if you're
*  ready to fight, how do you make sure you don't have a space war in the first place?
*  The Space Force's operations division is headquartered on the southeastern side of Colorado Springs
*  in a massive three-story building within the guarded perimeter of Peterson Space Force Base.
*  Until recently, it was Peterson Air Force Base. The office's inner workings are highly secure
*  and secretive. The Force, as one security analyst told me, has a larger proportion of its budget,
*  around $26 billion this year, dedicated to classified spending than any other branch of the military.
*  Visitors to headquarters are not allowed to bring electronic devices or walk unescorted inside.
*  The building nevertheless hums with activity, with personnel hustling about under a canopy of
*  scale model satellites, large replicas of machines that now orbit Earth, hanging in a bright,
*  airy atrium. When I visited in late September, several military and civilian personnel
*  took me through their day-to-day work. Right away, they noted that the Space Force is often mistaken
*  for United States Space Command, also headquartered in Colorado, that reports to the US Secretary of Defense.
*  Space Command is a decision-making entity that coordinates space-related operations for all
*  branches of the armed forces. The Space Force, by contrast, outfits and trains troops for potential
*  space conflicts, scrutinizes space for dangers, and launches satellites for the Department of Defense.
*  The Space Force regularly consults with Space Command to ask how, or whether, the potential threats
*  it discovers should be addressed. As large as the Space Force's remit seems to be, to monitor,
*  protect, and ensure access to a territory far larger than Earth's oceans, technology now enables
*  economies of scale. It's a big domain with the smallest force, smaller than the Coast Guard,
*  Christopher Ares, the technical director to the Deputy Commanding General for Operations,
*  explained. All told, the Space Force has about 8,600 military guardians at about 5,000 civilian
*  guardians. But you don't need hundreds of people to operate a satellite after launch. You may need
*  only one. Space Force personnel often do their work in air-conditioned, windowless buildings,
*  outfitted with computer servers and robust intelligence links. During critical situations,
*  they deploy in place, that is, they report to the same offices, but at a heightened state of readiness.
*  Guardians tend to think of the realm they patrol as a kind of structured, multi-level terrain,
*  Earth as being surrounded by three highways or three rings. The nearest level, low-Earth orbit,
*  Leo, is host to constellations like SpaceX's Starlink Network and the International Space Station,
*  which moves about 250 miles above us at 17,500 miles per hour. Medium Earth orbit,
*  Neo, between 1222,000 miles above, is where GPS satellites circle. At the highest ring,
*  at least for now, is a track known as Geosynchronous orbit, Geo, because an object in such an orbit
*  keeps pace with Earth's rotation. This band is home to direct TV satellites, whether tracking instruments
*  from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Crucial Defense Department
*  communication links. It's a technological zoo up there. The satellite mix is foreign and domestic,
*  young and old, sinister and peaceful. The technologies are all different sizes, flying at different
*  speeds and altitudes. The challenge for the force is to monitor all movement, but also to track
*  the threatening presence of debris, the some of which is naturally occurring, tiny rocks, for instance,
*  and some of which has human origins, like shards of old rockets. Because space junk can move at
*  extraordinary velocities, a floating screw might pack a destructive punch equivalent to a small bomb.
*  The main focus within the Space Force is on observation and deterrence. Nobody wants a space war,
*  I was reminded frequently. But the force has a capacity to mobilize when necessary.
*  At Peterson, I visited an electromagnetic warfare center, a building not far from headquarters,
*  but ringed with surveillance cameras and an additional perimeter of high fencing,
*  where men and women train to unjam signals that may be intentionally interfering with American
*  planes, ships and ground troops. It would be like watching TV and you can't get the signal,
*  Lieutenant Colonel DJ Thomas, who leads the team, told me. In emergencies, Thomas said,
*  his guardians would pack up a pair of portable dish antennas and a customized computer console
*  that a moment's notice, a combined unit that struck me as fitting easily into a minivan,
*  and ship out to remote locations all over the world. The rooms I visited at the
*  Electromagnetic Warfare Center were for defensive training, a part of the building was given over
*  two offensive tactics, clearly the force sees both as necessary. And if a requirement to
*  blind and deafened and enemies satellites were to arise from US Space Command, the Space Force
*  could help fulfill the order. The means would most likely not be kinetic, some form of physical
*  or explosive contact, but electronic, a weapon of code-related stealth, or perhaps a kind of
*  debilitating high-energy burst. Colonel Chandler Atwood of Space Force Operations Command
*  told me that what concerns him most is his belief that Americans are unaware of how rapidly
*  orbital dangers have evolved. He acknowledged that the force observes multiple events daily
*  in space that require its attention. It's not the kinetic threat that keeps me up at night,
*  he added, it's the cyber-defense aspect. We have significant vulnerabilities we have to harden up.
*  From Peterson, I took a 30-minute ride to a smaller Space Force Base in Colorado known as Shriever,
*  which sits on a grassy plain with a distant view of Pikes Peak. To reach the Space Force's
*  orbital warfare unit, meant passing through a gated station at the base's perimeter and barriers
*  of high protective fencing monitored by guards with body armor and weapons. Lieutenant Colonel
*  Galen Thorpe escorted me inside the complex. The most crucial part of his work occurs inside a
*  building where about 120 guardians working in teams of five at a time, push buttons, as Thorpe
*  put it, to drive five maneuverable observation satellites known as G-SAPs for the Geosynchronous
*  Space Situational Awareness Program at a distance of 22,300 miles above Earth.
*  Unlike many satellites, which cannot be significantly steered once they're put into orbit,
*  these have tanks of propellant and are akin to enormous remote controlled drones.
*  The program was originally created inside the Air Force. I asked Thorpe how things had evolved
*  since his unit was reconfigured within the Space Force three years ago. He pointed to a shift
*  in posture from nearly cataloging all the satellites in orbit to scrutinizing their behavior,
*  using tools like G-SAPs in terms of threat awareness, or, as he put it, we have to know where these
*  objects are in a protect and defend sense. Thorpe's colleague, Captain Raymond Pereira,
*  drawing on a whiteboard, pointed me to another concern, the crowd of satellites in low Earth orbit.
*  I would say we're probably already entering into an area where congestion is a problem,
*  he said, and anything that would generate debris would be catastrophic for the domain.
*  One plausible theory is known as the Kessler syndrome, named after the former NASA scientist
*  Donald Kessler, which posits that a release of wreckage and fragments in this orbit could eventually
*  lead to a domino effect of unstoppable destruction. Pereira pointed out that if someone, or something,
*  or to touch off such an event, they would not only be harming their adversary, they would be
*  harming themselves. But even short of that, a single collision or attack might hamstring science
*  missions to the moon, or to Mars, or lead to failures for GPS and communications systems,
*  a problem that could have huge consequences for life on Earth.
*  Keeping track of 44,500 items moving around the planet, along with new arrivals that slip
*  into orbit nearly every week, poses a multi-dimensional task. Who launched these machines?
*  Why? What could they do? We need to know what's up there. Where is it going and why we should be
*  concerned? Colonel Brian McLean of the Space Force told me.
*  This goal, known as Space Domain Awareness, has become one of the forces over arching priorities.
*  There are enormous challenges in creating a system of constant observation and making sense of
*  so much data. What constitutes threatening activities in orbit moreover and what might necessitate
*  a strategic response is not always clear. In truth, Space has few unquestioned laws,
*  apart from those relating to gravity. A treaty from the late 1960s, signed by most of the major
*  nations on Earth, prohibits the use of nuclear weapons in space and designates the moon for peaceful
*  purposes. But recently, I was told, satellites from foreign adversaries have been coming close to
*  machines from the United States and its allies. The treaty says nothing about such provocations,
*  or about grappling hooks, nesting dolls, and cyber warfare.
*  Space Force leaders readily describe their guardians as working toward a state of combat readiness,
*  even as they hope an era of actual conflict never arrives. In October, I went to the Pentagon to
*  meet with General Chance Sultzman, the chief of space operations, and the Space Force's highest
*  ranking officer. Sultzman remarked that several decades back, when he began working with satellites
*  in the Air Force, the notion that there could be combat losses in space was not part of the conversation.
*  But those are discussions now, he told me, because both the Chinese and the Russians have demonstrated
*  operational capabilities that truly placed those assets at risk. In 2007, China's decision to
*  test an ASAT weapon to destroy one of its own satellites sent shockwaves through the US military
*  and created a vast field of debris. A similar Russian tactic in 2021 generated more than
*  1,500 fragments, and led Secretary of State Antony Blinken to describe the act as recklessly
*  conducted. The Space Force's own squadrons, Sultzman told me, were still tracking pieces of junk
*  that date to the 2007 explosion. You know, the other domains kind of clean themselves up after war?
*  Sultzman said, you shoot an airplane down, it falls out of the sky, ships sink out of the sea lanes,
*  even on land, you bring the bulldozers in and you move things around. But space doesn't heal itself.
*  Debris has led military strategists to ponder a related issue. In space, it's difficult to get out
*  of the way of conflict. Right now, Sultzman noted, if you pull up real-time data to see where flights
*  are around the world, the airspace over Ukraine is empty. You will see a void, he said. Commercial
*  air traffic does not want to fly over Ukraine. The same thing happens in shipping lanes, like the
*  straight of Hormuz, when the Middle East is in turmoil, as it is now. So in other domains,
*  refugees, displaced persons, people get out of the way of conflict. Commercial entities move out
*  of the way and avoid conflict. In space, orbital mechanics take over, machines keep going around
*  and around, following the laws of gravity. NASA satellites may not be able to steer away from a
*  potential combat zone, and commercial entities can't move, or won't know where or when to move,
*  and then potentially every satellite becomes more debris, Sultzman remarked. Every peaceful satellite
*  could become a weapon accidentally. By asked Sultzman what he and his colleagues had learned from
*  observing the war in Ukraine, with a caveat that the fighting is hardly over, it could still be a
*  catastrophe on a grand scale, he said. He pointed to several crucial events. The first was how one of
*  Russia's earliest endeavors was to deny Ukrainian troops access to a satellite communications
*  system they relied upon, known as Viasat, which is stationed in the distant Gio-Synchronous
*  orbital belt. And they did it with a cyber attack against the ground infrastructure, he said,
*  so you attack the ground network to achieve the space effect you want.
*  This wasn't a surprise to him, he said, yet it was a reminder of the potential power of cyber
*  warfare and how battles to dominate space could still be terrestrial.
*  Another crucial point came after that attack, Ukraine's decision to go to a commercial vendor,
*  SpaceX, and use its Starlink system for combat communications. Here the lesson was twofold,
*  first that what Sultzman called commercial augmentation could prove vital in a crisis,
*  as important he added, Starlink, a configuration of hundreds of proliferated small satellites
*  flying in low-Earth orbit, has proved hard to bring down. The Russians are trying to interrupt it,
*  he said, and they're not having very good success. And the takeaway is that proliferated systems of
*  many small machines in low orbit can be more technologically resilient to hacking and disruption
*  than a few big machines in higher orbits. This seems to fit into Sultzman's goal of maintaining
*  strength during combat while achieving a larger objective of avoiding conflict altogether.
*  If I have two or three satellite communications doing nuclear command and control,
*  maybe those are targets, he explained. But if I take nuclear command and control and spread it
*  across 400 satellites that are zipping over the horizon every 15 minutes, there's a targeting problem.
*  How many satellites do I have to shoot down now to take out the US nuclear command and control?
*  If the answer was 400, it would make things difficult for the enemy.
*  And while small satellites in a large configuration could potentially be a more expensive investment,
*  than two or three mega satellites, the shift could be worthwhile.
*  If an adversary believes that it cannot achieve a military objective, Sultzman remarked,
*  it will hesitate to cross a threshold of violence. No conflicts, no debris, no crisis.
*  The US nuclear intelligence system
*  used to suffer massive massive disasters in the US.
*  Over the course of several days in Los Angeles, that space systems command,
*  a Space Force division that plans and requires technology,
*  I met with about a dozen kernels who detailed their ideas for the next decade.
*  Some discussions addressed the space force's goal of being able to launch satellites within say
*  24 hours in urgent situations.
*  I learned the force is working on developing machines that can be refueled in orbit, as
*  well as satellites that can repair other satellites.
*  Because rockets and orbital objects travel so fast, the International Space Station circles
*  Earth every 90 minutes, some tacticians are pondering being able to deliver via launches
*  into space a high-value package, such as a rare medication or a vital part for an F-35
*  fighter jet halfway across the world in as little as 30 minutes.
*  Other projects are less speculative.
*  There are deep concerns within the military about China and Russia's hypersonic glide
*  weapons, which may be able to avoid defense systems through bursts of speed and pretzel
*  flight pads.
*  In response, the force is trying to implement a new system of detection in the next several
*  years at low and middle-earth orbits.
*  It took ample funds to build and launch the old systems, Colonel Heather Bogstey, who
*  helps oversee the program, told me, but with the speed our adversaries are fielding
*  these hypersonic glide vehicles, we don't have the luxury of time anymore.
*  Brian Wheaton of the Secure World Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on keeping the orbital
*  realm peaceful and sustainable, told me that the US military has faced perennial challenges
*  in reducing costs and delivery times for new space-based projects, and that the space
*  force has yet to prove it can buck that trend.
*  Still, the force is trying to nurture America's domestic rocket industry, acting as a
*  facilitator for national security launches, while stoking the growth and bringing down
*  the expense of fledgling commercial enterprises.
*  The Department of Defense sometimes requires big rockets to take heavy satellites farther
*  into space, that is, into the Mio or Geo layers, making for significant technical challenges
*  for new companies.
*  Colonel Douglas Pentecost, the Deputy Director of Launch Enterprise at Space Systems Command,
*  also told me that because some launches carry very precious, super-secret instruments, they
*  cannot fail under any circumstances.
*  For now, SpaceX has demonstrated the capabilities and safety record to carry these payloads.
*  But Pentecost told me, we can't rely on one company to always be there for us, and
*  that's basically taking us back to the 1980s when we were relying on the space shuttle,
*  and then when the space shuttle had its unfortunate accident, we had no way into space for several
*  years.
*  In an effort to diversify risks, Pentecost's team is working with the United Launch Alliance,
*  a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing.
*  Global companies, Firefly, Rocket Lab, and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, for instance, are
*  in the mix too.
*  The goal would be a range of reliable and cheaper launch companies to choose from by the late
*  2020s.
*  Pentecost said he would soon like to be able to get any payload into orbit at any time.
*  There is a darker side that accompanies a future of rampant growth.
*  As space becomes commercialized, it increasingly becomes a geopolitical arena for competition
*  too.
*  Just as China launched a space plane that stayed aloft for months, so has the US Space
*  Force.
*  Just as competitors develop satellites that make close and unnerving approaches to our
*  satellites, so does the US Space Force.
*  There are so many launches now planned, and so many designs for enigmatic satellites
*  in the works.
*  It becomes hard not to wonder if the United States will become engaged in a new arms race,
*  or to ask if it already has.
*  In 1950, a political scientist named John Hertz introduced the term security dilemma, noting
*  that in international affairs, a state concerned with being attacked, subjected, dominated,
*  or annihilated by others, can be drawn into a vicious circle of building up its defenses.
*  One implication of this, a political scientist named Robert Jervis later posited, is that
*  one states gain insecurity and inadvertently threatens others.
*  When I asked Sultzman if this was a concern, he acknowledged that it was, but he also said
*  that the security dilemma was a phenomenon that probably dated back thousands of years.
*  Weapons are not inherently offensive or defensive, Sultzman maintained.
*  Weapons are just weapons, and the operations that you choose to undertake with those weapons
*  makes them more offensive or defensive.
*  The important question, as he saw it, was this, at what point does a build up of defensive
*  weapons in space constitute an ability to conduct offensive operations so that someone
*  else feels threatened?
*  There is a balance here, he said, and this is about stability management.
*  What actions can we take to protect ourselves before we start to cross the line and maybe
*  create a security dilemma?
*  The line, he suggested, harder to find in space no doubt, and at this point not clearly
*  defined, had not yet been crossed.
