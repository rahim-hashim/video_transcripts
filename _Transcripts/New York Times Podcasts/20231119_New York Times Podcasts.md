# The Sunday Read: ‘What Does the U.S. Space Force Actually Do?’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ckdx1J03Hg)
*  Hi, my name is John Gertner.
*  I'm a contributor to the New York Times Magazine, and I write about science and technology.
*  This week's Sunday Read is a story I wrote for the magazine Space Issue about the Space
*  Force.
*  It's the newest, smallest, and most secretive branch of the US military.
*  It was established just four years ago, and its members, they're called guardians, are
*  in charge of observing and protecting everything that belongs to America that's orbiting above
*  the Earth.
*  That includes defending military satellites and all the satellites we sometimes take for
*  granted that are vital to our day-to-day lives.
*  Unlike, say, the Air Force or even the Coast Guard, you won't see photos of its planes
*  and ships in service.
*  And because so much of its work is out of sight, the Space Force has almost become this
*  caricature.
*  There's even a Netflix comedy series about it starring Steve Carell.
*  The operating costs for the Space Force amount to about $26 billion a year.
*  And I don't think it's uncommon to hear questions like, well, why do we need to spend so much
*  to protect our satellites?
*  Or are these threat star satellites real or imagined?
*  But picture life without GPS, without mapping and directions, or without weather satellites,
*  which our entire agricultural systems depend on.
*  Our lives are tied very intimately to what's happening in space.
*  And so I wanted to find out what does this new branch of the military actually do, and
*  how do they do it?
*  So after approaching the Space Force and explaining the premise of my story, they agreed to give
*  me some access that I think they don't ordinarily offer.
*  In Colorado, I visited the Peterson and Shriver bases, which were formerly used by the Air
*  Force.
*  I also went to a place called Space Systems Command in Los Angeles, not far from LAX.
*  Most of the time, there was a great veil of secrecy over what the Guardians were doing.
*  At Peterson, I couldn't bring any electronic devices into the buildings.
*  I could only go old school and use a notebook.
*  There were some people I couldn't quote by name.
*  And sometimes I'd enter a room and it would need to be vacated before I could walk through
*  it.
*  And I'd have to pass through quickly.
*  But I did uncover a lot in my reporting about how and why the Space Force operates, which
*  you'll hear about in my story.
*  One of the most striking things to me was this.
*  I've always thought of space as a place of wonder and delight and endless curiosity.
*  But the Space Force Guardians, in their own words, consider space to be a contested, congested,
*  war-fighting domain.
*  This military branch of about 15,000 people has to prepare for a war in space, even as
*  they do everything they can to prevent a war in space.
*  It's this delicate balancing act between security and the kind of arms race we've entered into
*  with Russia and China.
*  And they have to make sure they don't overstep it.
*  So here's my article.
*  What Does the U.S. Space Force Actually Do?
*  Read by Eric Jason Martin
*  Chief Master Sergeant Ron Lurch of the U.S. Space Force sat down in his office in Los
*  Angeles one morning in September to deliver a briefing known as a threat assessment.
*  The current threats in space are less sci-fi than you might expect, but there are a surprising
*  number of them.
*  At least 44,500 space objects now circle Earth, including 9,000 active satellites and 19,000
*  significant pieces of debris.
*  What's most concerning isn't the swarm of satellites, but the types.
*  We know that there are kinetic kill vehicles, Lurch said.
*  For example, a Russian nesting doll satellite, in which a big satellite releases a tiny one
*  and the tiny one releases a mechanism that can strike and damage another satellite.
*  There are machines with the ability to cast nets and extend grappling hooks, too.
*  China, whose presence in space now far outpaces Russia's, is launching unmanned space planes
*  into orbit, testing potentially unbreakable quantum communication links and adding AI
*  capabilities to satellites.
*  An intelligence report, Lurch said, predicted the advent within the next decade of satellites
*  with radio-frequency jammers, chemical sprayers and lasers that blind and disable the competition.
*  All this would be in addition to the cyber warfare tools, electromagnetic instruments
*  and ASAT anti-satellite missiles that already exist on the ground.
*  In Lurch's assessment, space looked less like a grand new ocean for exploration, phrasing
*  meant to induce wonder that is lingered from the Kennedy administration, and more like
*  a robotic battlefield where the conflicts raging on Earth would soon extend ever upward.
*  The Space Force, the sixth and newest branch of the U.S. military, was authorized by Congress
*  and signed into law by President Donald Trump in December 2019.
*  Its creation was not a partisan endeavor, though Trump has boasted that the idea for
*  the organization was his alone.
*  The initiative had in fact been shaped within the armed forces and Congress over the previous
*  25 years, based on the premise that as satellite and space technologies evolved, America's
*  military organizations had to change as well.
*  In its incarnation, the Space Force was an assemblage of programs and teams that already
*  existed, mainly as entities within the Air Force.
*  It's one of the common misperceptions that it cost money to create the Space Force, and
*  it really didn't, because we already had Space Forces, Todd Harrison of the Center for Strategic
*  and International Studies told me.
*  These were just spread throughout the military, the people, the bases, the platforms, the
*  satellites, the ground stations.
*  What the new directive did accomplish, however, was to group space endeavors under a central
*  chain of command and authorize its leaders to chart a unified future.
*  One of the things that we were lacking without a Space Force was an organization that would
*  argue for its own destiny.
*  Douglas Loverro, a former Pentagon official involved in helping start the branch, told
*  me.
*  The concern was that without a dedicated team within the military's bureaucracy that could
*  push for the specific tools they needed, the United States would be at a disadvantage.
*  Some strategists worried that the nation already was.
*  Loverro pointed out that two decades ago, a Chinese military analyst named Wang Hucheng
*  wrote a paper that presaged an aspect of China's aerospace strategy.
*  For countries that can never win a war with the United States by using the method of tanks
*  and planes, attacking the U.S. space system may be an irresistible and most tempting choice.
*  The argument identified space as the U.S. military's soft ribs and strategic weakness.
*  From the start, the Space Force had detractors.
*  Air Force officials wondered if it was necessary, while some political observers believed that
*  it signified the start of a dangerous and expensive militarization of another realm.
*  What seemed harder to argue against was how nearly every aspect of modern warfare and
*  defense, intelligence, surveillance, communications, operations, missile detection, has come to
*  rely on links to orbiting satellites.
*  The recent battles in Eastern Europe, in which Russia has tried to disrupt Ukraine's space-borne
*  communication systems, are a case in point.
*  And yet, the strategic exploitation of space now extends well beyond military concerns.
*  Satellite phone systems have become widespread.
*  Positioning and timing satellites, such as GPS, now overseen by the Space Force, allow
*  for digital mapping, navigation, banking, and agricultural management.
*  A world without orbital weather surveys seems unthinkable.
*  Human life is reliant on space technologies to an extent that an interruption would create
*  profound economic and social distress.
*  The work of the Space Force is by its nature highly sensitive, often classified, and mostly
*  out of sight.
*  This leaves the organization in a battle for visibility, and at times viability.
*  Some members of the Force, Guardians, as they're called, told me that even now they
*  find themselves bumping into members of other branches of the military who see their arm
*  patches and ask, in earnest, Space Force, is that a real thing?
*  The Steve Carell Netflix comedy series, which members of the actual Space Force sometimes
*  argue is neither good nor funny, doesn't help their cause.
*  It likewise doesn't capture their seriousness of purpose.
*  For the moment, the Force has taken up a problem not often contemplated outside science fiction.
*  How do you fight a war in space, or a war on Earth that expands into space?
*  And even if you're ready to fight, how do you make sure you don't have a space war
*  in the first place?
*  The Space Force's operations division is headquartered on the southeastern side of Colorado Springs,
*  in a massive three-story building within the guarded perimeter of Peterson Space Force
*  Base.
*  Until recently, it was Peterson Air Force Base.
*  The office's inner workings are highly secure and secretive.
*  The Force, as one security analyst told me, has a larger proportion of its budget, around
*  $26 billion this year, dedicated to classified spending than any other branch of the military.
*  Visitors to headquarters are not allowed to bring electronic devices or walk unescorted
*  inside.
*  The building nevertheless hums with activity, with personnel hustling about under a canopy
*  of scale model satellites, large replicas of machines that now orbit Earth, hanging in
*  a bright, airy atrium.
*  When I visited in late September, several military and civilian personnel took me through
*  their day-to-day work.
*  Right away, they noted that the Space Force is often mistaken for United States Space
*  Command, also headquartered in Colorado, that reports to the U.S. Secretary of Defense.
*  Space Command is a decision-making entity that coordinates space-related operations
*  for all branches of the armed forces.
*  The Space Force, by contrast, outfits and trains troops for potential space conflicts,
*  scrutinizes space for dangers, and launches satellites for the Department of Defense.
*  The Space Force regularly consults with Space Command to ask how, or whether, the potential
*  discovers should be addressed.
*  As large as the Space Force's remit seems to be, to monitor, protect, and ensure access
*  to a territory far larger than Earth's oceans, technology now enables economies of scale.
*  It's a big domain with the smallest force, smaller than the Coast Guard.
*  Christopher Ayers, the technical director to the deputy commanding general for operations,
*  explained.
*  All told, the Space Force has about 8,600 military guardians and about 5,000 civilian
*  guardians.
*  But you don't need hundreds of people to operate a satellite after launch.
*  You may need only one.
*  Space Force personnel often do their work in air-conditioned, windowless buildings outfitted
*  with computer servers and robust intelligence links.
*  In critical situations, they deploy in place.
*  That is, they report to the same offices, but at a heightened state of readiness.
*  Guardians tend to think of the realm they patrol as a kind of structured, multi-level
*  terrain, Earth as being surrounded by three highways or three rings.
*  The nearest level, low Earth orbit, LEO, is host to constellations like SpaceX's Starlink
*  Network and the International Space Station, which moves about 250 miles above us at 17,500
*  miles per hour.
*  A medium Earth orbit, NEO, between 1,200 and 22,000 miles above, is where GPS satellites
*  circle.
*  At the highest ring, at least for now, is a track known as Geosynchronous Orbit, GEO,
*  because an object in such an orbit keeps pace with Earth's rotation.
*  This band is home to direct TV satellites, weather tracking instruments from the National
*  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and crucial Defense Department communication links.
*  It's a technological zoo up there.
*  The satellite mix is foreign and domestic, young and old, sinister and peaceful.
*  The technologies are all different sizes, flying at different speeds and altitudes.
*  The challenge for the force is to monitor all movement, but also to track the threatening
*  presence of debris, some of which is naturally occurring, tiny rocks, for instance, and some
*  of which has human origins, like shards of old rockets.
*  Because space junk can move at extraordinary velocities, a floating screw might pack a
*  destructive punch equivalent to a small bomb.
*  The main focus within the Space Force is on observation and deterrence.
*  Nobody wants a space war, I was reminded frequently, but the force has a capacity to mobilize
*  when necessary.
*  At Peterson, I visited an electromagnetic warfare center, a building not far from headquarters,
*  but ringed with surveillance cameras and an additional perimeter of high fencing, where
*  men and women train to unjam signals that may be intentionally interfering with American
*  planes, ships and ground troops.
*  It would be like watching TV and you can't get the signal, Lt. Col. D.J. Thomas, who
*  leads the team, told me.
*  In emergencies, Thomas said, his guardians would pack up a pair of portable dish antennas
*  and a customized computer console at a moment's notice, a combined unit that struck me as
*  fitting easily into a minivan, and ship out to remote locations all over the world.
*  The rooms I visited at the electromagnetic warfare center were for defensive training.
*  A part of the building was given over to offensive tactics.
*  Clearly, the force sees both as necessary.
*  And if a requirement to blind and deafen an enemy's satellites were to arise from U.S.
*  Space Command, the Space Force could help fulfill the order.
*  The means would most likely not be kinetic, some form of physical or explosive contact,
*  but electronic, a weapon of code-related stealth, or perhaps a kind of debilitating high-energy
*  burst.
*  Col. Chandler Atwood of Space Force Operations Command told me that what concerns him most
*  is his belief that Americans are unaware of how rapidly orbital dangers have evolved.
*  He acknowledged that the force observes multiple events daily in space that require its attention.
*  It's not the kinetic threat that keeps me up at night, he added.
*  It's the cyber defense aspect.
*  We have significant vulnerabilities we have to harden up.
*  From Peterson, I took a 30-minute ride to a smaller Space Force base in Colorado known
*  as Shreiver, which sits on a grassy plain with a distant view of Pike's Peak.
*  To reach the Space Force's Orbital Warfare Unit meant passing through a gated station
*  at the base's perimeter and barriers of high-protective fencing monitored by guards with body armor
*  and weapons.
*  Lt. Col. Galen Thorpe escorted me inside the complex.
*  The most crucial part of his work occurs inside a building where about 120 guardians, working
*  in teams of five at a time, push buttons, as Thorpe put it, to drive five maneuverable
*  observation satellites known as GSAPs for the Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness
*  Program at a distance of 22,300 miles above Earth.
*  Unlike many satellites, which cannot be significantly steered once they're put into orbit, these
*  have tanks of propellant and are akin to enormous remote-controlled drones.
*  The program was originally created inside the Air Force.
*  I asked Thorpe how things had evolved since his unit was reconfigured within the Space
*  Force three years ago.
*  He pointed to a shift in posture, from merely cataloging all the satellites in orbit to
*  their behavior, using tools like GSAPs in terms of threat awareness, or, as he put it,
*  we have to know where these objects are in a protect-and-defend sense.
*  Thorpe's colleague, Captain Raymond Pereira, drawing on a whiteboard, pointed me to another
*  concern, the crowd of satellites in low Earth orbit.
*  I would say we're probably already entering into an area where congestion is a problem,
*  he said, and anything that would generate debris would be catastrophic for the domain.
*  One plausible theory is known as the Kessler syndrome, named after the former NASA scientist
*  Donald Kessler, which posits that a release of wreckage and fragments in this orbit could
*  eventually lead to a domino effect of unstoppable destruction.
*  Pereira pointed out that if someone, or something, were to touch off such an event, they would
*  not only be harming their adversary, they would be harming themselves.
*  But even short of that, a single collision or attack might hamstring science missions
*  to the Moon, or to Mars, or lead to failures for GPS and communications systems, a problem
*  that could have huge consequences for life on Earth.
*  Keeping track of 44,500 items moving around the planet, along with new arrivals that slip
*  into orbit nearly every week, poses a multi-dimensional task.
*  Who launched these machines?
*  Why?
*  What could they do?
*  We need to know what's up there, where is it going, and why we should be concerned,
*  Colonel Brian McLean of the Space Force told me.
*  This goal, known as space domain awareness, has become one of the Force's overarching
*  priorities.
*  There are enormous challenges in creating a system of constant observation and making
*  sense of so much data.
*  What constitutes threatening activities in orbit, moreover, and what might necessitate
*  a strategic response is not always clear.
*  In truth, space has few unquestioned laws apart from those relating to gravity.
*  A treaty from the late 1960s, signed by most of the major nations on Earth, prohibits the
*  use of nuclear weapons in space and designates the Moon for peaceful purposes.
*  But recently, I was told, satellites from foreign adversaries have been coming close
*  to machines from the United States and its allies.
*  The treaty says nothing about such provocations or about grappling hooks, nesting dolls, and
*  cyber warfare.
*  Space Force leaders readily describe their guardians as working toward a state of combat
*  readiness, even as they hope an era of actual conflict never arrives.
*  In October, I went to the Pentagon to meet with General Chance Saltzman, the chief of
*  space operations and the Space Force's highest-ranking officer.
*  Saltzman remarked that several decades back, when he began working with satellites in the
*  Air Force, the notion that there could be combat losses in space was not part of the
*  conversation.
*  But those are discussions now, he told me, because both the Chinese and the Russians
*  have demonstrated operational capabilities that truly placed those assets at risk.
*  In 2007, China's decision to test an ASAT weapon to destroy one of its own satellites
*  sent shockwaves through the U.S. military and created a vast field of debris.
*  A similar Russian tactic in 2021 generated more than 1,500 fragments and led Secretary
*  of State Antony Blinken to describe the act as, recklessly conducted.
*  The Space Force's own squadrons, Saltzman told me, were still tracking pieces of junk
*  that date to the 2007 explosion.
*  You know, the other domains kind of clean themselves up after war.
*  Saltzman said, you shoot an airplane down, it falls out of the sky.
*  Ships sink out of the sea lanes.
*  Even on land, you bring the bulldozers in and you move things around.
*  But space doesn't heal itself.
*  History has led military strategists to ponder a related issue.
*  In space, it's difficult to get out of the way of conflict.
*  Right now, Saltzman noted, if you pull up real-time data to see where flights are around
*  the world, the airspace over Ukraine is empty.
*  You will see a void, he said.
*  Commercial air traffic does not want to fly over Ukraine.
*  The same thing happens in shipping lanes, like the Strait of Hormuz, when the Middle
*  East is in turmoil, as it is now.
*  So in other domains, refugees, displaced persons, people get out of the way of conflict.
*  Commercial entities move out of the way and avoid conflict.
*  In space, orbital mechanics take over.
*  Machines keep going around and around, following the laws of gravity.
*  Because satellites may not be able to steer away from a potential combat zone, and commercial
*  entities can't move, or won't know where or when to move.
*  And then potentially every satellite becomes more debris, Saltzman remarked.
*  Every peaceful satellite could become a weapon accidentally.
*  I asked Saltzman what he and his colleagues had learned from observing the war in Ukraine,
*  With a caveat that the fighting is hardly over, it could still be a catastrophe on a
*  grand scale, he said.
*  He pointed to several crucial events.
*  The first was how one of Russia's earliest endeavors was to deny Ukrainian troops access
*  to a satellite communications system they relied upon, known as Viasat, which is stationed
*  in the distant geosynchronous orbital belt.
*  And they did it with a cyber attack against the ground infrastructure, he said, so you
*  attack the ground network to achieve the space effect you want.
*  This wasn't a surprise to him, he said, yet it was a reminder of the potential power of
*  cyber warfare and how battles to dominate space could still be terrestrial.
*  Another crucial point came after that attack, Ukraine's decision to go to a commercial
*  vendor, SpaceX, and use its Starlink system for combat communications.
*  Here the lesson was twofold.
*  First that what Saltzman called commercial augmentation could prove vital in a crisis.
*  As important, he added, Starlink, a configuration of hundreds of proliferated small satellites
*  flying in low Earth orbit, has proved hard to bring down.
*  The Russians are trying to interrupt it, he said, and they're not having very good
*  success.
*  And the takeaway is that proliferated systems of many small machines in low orbit can be
*  more technologically resilient to hacking and disruption than a few big machines in
*  higher orbits.
*  This seems to fit into Saltzman's goal of maintaining strength during combat while achieving
*  a larger objective of avoiding conflict altogether.
*  If I have two or three satellite communications doing nuclear command and control, maybe those
*  are targets, he explained.
*  But if I take nuclear command and control and spread it across 400 satellites that are
*  zipping over the horizon every 15 minutes, there's a targeting problem.
*  How many satellites do I have to shoot down now to take out the U.S. nuclear command and
*  control?
*  If the answer was 400, it would make things difficult for the enemy.
*  And while small satellites in a large configuration could potentially be a more expensive investment
*  than two or three mega satellites, the shift could be worthwhile.
*  If an adversary believes that it cannot achieve a military objective, Saltzman remarked, it
*  will hesitate to cross a threshold of violence.
*  No conflicts.
*  No debris.
*  No crisis.
*  Over the course of several days in Los Angeles at Space Systems Command, a Space Force division
*  that plans and acquires technology, I met with about a dozen colonels who detailed their
*  ideas for the next decade.
*  Some discussions addressed the Space Force's goal of being able to launch satellites within,
*  say, 24 hours in urgent situations.
*  I learned the Force is working on developing machines that can be refueled in orbit, as
*  well as satellites that can repair other satellites.
*  Because rockets and orbital objects travel so fast, the International Space Station circles
*  Earth every 90 minutes.
*  Some tacticians are pondering being able to deliver, via launches into space, a high-value
*  package such as a rare medication or a vital part for an F-35 fighter jet halfway across
*  the world in as little as 30 minutes.
*  Other projects are less speculative.
*  There are deep concerns within the military about China and Russia's hypersonic glide
*  which may be able to avoid defense systems through bursts of speed and pretzeled flight
*  paths.
*  In response, the Force is trying to implement a new system of detection in the next several
*  years at low and middle Earth orbits.
*  It took ample funds to build and launch the old systems, Colonel Heather Bogsdy, who helps
*  oversee the program, told me.
*  And with the speed our adversaries are fielding these hypersonic glide vehicles, we don't
*  have the luxury of time anymore.
*  Brian Wheaton of the Secure World Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on keeping the orbital
*  realm peaceful and sustainable, told me that the U.S. military has faced perennial challenges
*  in reducing costs and delivery times for new space-based projects, and that the Space Force
*  has yet to prove it can buck that trend.
*  Still, the Force is trying to nurture America's domestic rocket industry, acting as a facilitator
*  for national security launches while stoking the growth and bringing down the expense of
*  fledgling commercial enterprises.
*  The Department of Defense sometimes requires big rockets to take heavy satellites farther
*  into space, that is, into the NEO or GEO layers, making for significant technical challenges
*  for new companies.
*  Colonel Douglas Pentecost, the deputy director of launch enterprise at Space Systems Command,
*  also told me that because some launches carry very precious, super-secret instruments, they
*  cannot fail under any circumstances.
*  For now, SpaceX has demonstrated the capabilities and safety record to carry these payloads.
*  But Pentecost told me, we can't rely on one company to always be there for us.
*  That's basically taking us back to the 1980s, when we were relying on the Space Shuttle,
*  and then when the Space Shuttle had its unfortunate accident, we had no way into space for several
*  years.
*  In an effort to diversify risks, Pentecost's team is working with the United Launch Alliance,
*  a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing.
*  Commercial companies, Firefly, Rocket Lab, and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, for instance,
*  are in the mix too.
*  The goal would be a range of reliable and cheaper launch companies to choose from by
*  the late 2020s.
*  Pentecost said he would soon like to be able to get any payload into orbit at any time.
*  There is a darker side that accompanies a future of rampant growth.
*  As space becomes commercialized, it increasingly becomes a geopolitical arena for competition
*  too.
*  Just as China launched a space plane that stayed aloft for months, so has the U.S. Space
*  Just as competitors develop satellites that make close and unnerving approaches to our
*  satellites, so does the U.S. Space Force.
*  With so many launches now planned and so many designs for enigmatic satellites in the works,
*  it becomes hard not to wonder if the United States will become engaged in a new arms race,
*  or to ask if it already has.
*  In 1950, a political scientist named John Hertz introduced the term security dilemma,
*  noting that in international affairs, a state concerned with being attacked, subjected,
*  dominated, or annihilated by others can be drawn into a vicious circle of building up
*  its defenses.
*  One implication of this, a political scientist named Robert Jervis later posited, is that
*  one state's gain in security inadvertently threatens others.
*  When I asked Saltzman if this was a concern, he acknowledged that it was, but he also said
*  that the security dilemma was a phenomenon that probably dated back thousands of years.
*  Weapons are not inherently offensive or defensive, Saltzman maintained.
*  Weapons are just weapons, and the operations that you choose to undertake with those weapons
*  makes them more offensive or defensive.
*  The important question, as he saw it, was this.
*  At what point does a buildup of defensive weapons in space constitute an ability to
*  conduct offensive operations so that someone else feels threatened?
*  There is a balance here, he said, and this is about stability management.
*  What actions can we take to protect ourselves before we start to cross the line and maybe
*  create a security dilemma?
*  The line, he suggested, harder to find in space, no doubt, and at this point not clearly
*  defined, had not yet been crossed.
