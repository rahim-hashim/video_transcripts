# Is Trump's Nomination Now Inevitable?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 22, 2023](https://rr1---sn-ab5l6nkd.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?expire=1711142749&ei=_aL9ZZTBN4i6_9EPoYCVoAs&ip=128.59.177.129&id=o-ACzm3FDyN80xmMkIoQ8ARgTVm53dnKtJdpJJtAS9Gy7T&itag=139&source=youtube&requiressl=yes&xpc=EgVo2aDSNQ%3D%3D&mh=O9&mm=31%2C29&mn=sn-ab5l6nkd%2Csn-ab5sznz6&ms=au%2Crdu&mv=m&mvi=1&pl=16&initcwndbps=1663750&vprv=1&mime=audio%2Fmp4&gir=yes&clen=15491309&dur=2540.207&lmt=1684749887220745&mt=1711120620&fvip=4&keepalive=yes&c=ANDROID_EMBEDDED_PLAYER&txp=6218224&sparams=expire%2Cei%2Cip%2Cid%2Citag%2Csource%2Crequiressl%2Cxpc%2Cvprv%2Cmime%2Cgir%2Cclen%2Cdur%2Clmt&sig=AJfQdSswRQIhAJ4I1UX-5ozdVyxBbbGscM3v4VRnqwZe79tD83L_sH_pAiAV4uaZCfD_vJUhIV4BvtjNeyZL94WMny8eD0mHGBOwMQ%3D%3D&lsparams=mh%2Cmm%2Cmn%2Cms%2Cmv%2Cmvi%2Cpl%2Cinitcwndbps&lsig=ALClDIEwRQIhAMZLOYbAbeyx7d5b-slAyt_IdQ8eqIJcyrWbKHtnNmeEAiAwuHLi12A41BbVtypAvWugMKp1RITthJbUEVGtqfGDlg%3D%3D)

*  And now on to the show.
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, as Governor Ron DeSantis is expected to enter the 2024 Republican presidential race
*  this week, he's pulling well below the leading candidate, former president Donald Trump.
*  It's a very different picture than just a few months ago when midterm voters embrace
*  DeSantis and his brand of cultural conservatism while overwhelmingly rejecting extremism and
*  Trump.
*  My colleague, Astead Harnan, host of our politics podcast, The Run Up, has been reporting on how
*  we got from there to here when Trump's nomination has started to feel almost inevitable.
*  It's Monday, May 22nd.
*  It's nice to see you in person.
*  It's nice to see you too.
*  Last week we were in this room was the midterm election night.
*  That's right.
*  That was almost a year ago.
*  Definitely that year.
*  I think actually someone is hopefully telling me that it was only six months ago.
*  Yeah, yeah, definitely.
*  Well, let's go back to that moment.
*  The last time you were on the show, right after the midterm elections, I just
*  think we remember you saying that while the result of that midterm election was a clear
*  rejection of Donald Trump by general election voters that didn't mean that Trumpism was
*  over.
*  The question that you posed heading into the next election, the 2024 presidential cycle,
*  was what's the Republican party going to do with a disappointing set of results and
*  with the person who ushered in those disappointing results, Donald Trump?
*  Yeah.
*  And I look back at that night and there was that feeling that Donald Trump had been
*  diminished by the electorate.
*  You had congressional leaders and conservative media asking an open question about whether
*  Donald Trump was still the kind of leader of the party because the Republican results were
*  so far from their expectations.
*  I think there was a natural political question to say, is this thing over?
*  Is this the time that when folks turn the page on Trump?
*  At the same time, I felt like I couldn't ignore my own reporting, which is that Trump
* ism is so deeply ingrained in the Republican party that even something like the midterm
*  results is not inherently clear that that's enough for it to be cut out.
*  So I kind of set off to understand what the midterms impact on Trump's power was.
*  And are we now looking at a Republican party where he is still the overwhelmingly dominant
*  political figure or are we looking at a Republican party where post midterms though
*  ground was really open for a new leader to emerge?
*  Right.
*  And there's one person in particular, I remember very clearly in that moment that people
*  are starting to look to as somebody who could take advantage of this weaker Trump.
*  Yeah, totally.
*  We're talking around the Sanctus.
*  We are.
*  I mean, yeah, I mean, Governor around the Sanctus because he had a good midterms night was
*  hoisted into the position of Donald Trump alternative almost immediately.
*  And for a Republican party where some folks have been looking for a way to turn the page
*  for a long time, he really embodied a lot of those hopes.
*  Right.
*  And of course, things have changed a tremendous amount since then.
*  So let's understand the said how we got to this moment where things seem kind of flipped
*  on their head from that place you just described.
*  So tell us where you start your reporting and why.
*  Well, we were thinking about how to kind of untangle this question.
*  Where are the places in the Republican party that the leadership and the decision makers
*  would be wrestling with both the reality of Trump's power and the reality of his drag
*  on the party's ability to win.
*  And what emerged for us was the R&C winter meeting in January in Zainaboyne, California.
*  This is a gathering of Republican insiders.
*  The folks who actually make the decisions about how to set up the primary process.
*  And this was their first party gathering since the midterm elections.
*  Right.
*  Embers are still smoldering.
*  The embers are still smoldering.
*  And what we found when we got there was a universal recognition of the party's disappointing
*  results.
*  No one was in confusion that the red wave was promised that the conditions were there and
*  that they failed to seize on it.
*  Right.
*  So when you arrive, this is a party that knows it's losing.
*  And in theory, this is going to be the place, this R&C meeting where party officials start
*  to scheme about how they're going to win again and whether that requires ditching Donald
*  Trump.
*  Exactly.
*  It was the unspoken elephant in every room that Donald Trump was part of the reason that
*  Republicans had had such losses.
*  And for different spaces of the party, they were having much different actions to that
*  information.
*  Can you just say your name and where you just put it?
*  John Fredericks, I am the Godzilla of Truth in America.
*  You can follow me at JF Radio Show.
*  The first person I meet at that winter meeting was a man named John Fredericks.
*  He's a big kind of Trump embodied radio host in Virginia.
*  And he was hosting a forum at that R&C event that was meant to really put pressure on the
*  Republican insider saying, hey, the kind of Trump base is still here.
*  And I think really importantly, we are not embarrassed by those results.
*  When we went to them, they had a clear explanation for why Republicans didn't do as well
*  as they did, which is what?
*  If you want to blame Trump, don't vote for him in the upcoming primaries.
*  That's your choice.
*  You can do that if you think he's the reason, right?
*  I happen to not think he is, but she is the chairman of the Republican National Committee.
*  They thought the establishment side of Republicans, I'm talking the party apparatus, the R&C,
*  including its chair, Ron and McDaniel, and the kind of Senate coffers of money that come
*  out of DC.
*  They felt that they had not adequately supported the Trump candidates in the midterm election.
*  I guess a question I have is how are those five elections her fault, but they're not Donald Trump's fault.
*  Why does she get blamed for those elections?
*  She's the chairman of the R&C.
*  She's done nothing on ballot harvesting.
*  She hasn't done anything in any of the critical areas.
*  That people like Harry Lake or her shawalker or Blake Masters would have all done better
*  if the Republican party had united around them.
*  It's just one big ring of consultants paying each other for this, that, TVS, etc.
*  And so they were all making money.
*  And rather than that, you have party leadership, polling them bad candidates publicly, and more
*  importantly, not giving them the data and money that could have been at their disposal.
*  And so they really blamed the mechanics of the Republican party for not adequately rallying
*  around the Trump candidates.
*  And that was the reason this group said they lost.
*  So to the degree that Frederick says, a proxy for the Trump base, the base is not seeing
*  Trump or the issues he cared about like election to nihilism as what cost the party these
*  midterm elections.
*  It's the Republican party that's responsible for that.
*  Absolutely.
*  It is an argument that is very convenient for them because it does not require them to
*  blame Trump or require them to blame the messages that those candidates gave.
*  But it allows them to continue a proxy war that's been happening in the Republican party
*  for a long time where the Trump base really sees its role as overtaking the Republican
*  establishment.
*  And they were really clearly expressing that.
*  It's, we're trying to take over the Republican party because what it represents right now
*  is the Mitt Romney elites, right?
*  We go to the infield of NASCAR, at Grill Hot Dogs, and Mitt Romney goes to the box of the
*  owner of the jets, right?
*  That's the disconnect.
*  And eventually we're going to take over the Republican party as a vehicle, right?
*  As a vehicle for our movement.
*  And I talked to Frederick, he said that Donald Trump had gotten so many people involved
*  in the party on the base level that the top levels of Republican leadership needed to defer
*  to them, but didn't and that they were the ones living in the past and not really dealing
*  with the reality, which is that Trumpism is the party and therefore requires being supported
*  as the party's dominant message.
*  That's what they felt was the disconnect that led to the midterms losses.
*  Was a Republican establishment that was not willing to go all in on Trump, not the Trump
*  and those messages had caused the losses.
*  But that's another really important thing that Frederick's told me at that event.
*  People have changed.
*  And it was that this is a different type of Trump grassroots in 2023 than it was in 2022.
*  The movement has eclipsed all of its current leaders.
*  That's what you're not.
*  It's eclipsed them all.
*  This is not defined anymore by its leaders.
*  That's the most important thing to realize.
*  And the movement itself is becoming the...
*  And that's because the Trump base, as he says, sees itself as bigger and more distinct
*  from Donald Trump as a campaign in candidate than they did before.
*  And I think this is an important point to understand.
*  Because that for a long time, we've kind of thought of this as a clear, causational relationship
*  that Donald Trump and his campaign says a message and that millions of these voters follow
*  that message.
*  Right.
*  Kind of robotically respond to that message that he is dictating the political priorities
*  of this base.
*  But when I talked to Fredrick at the RNC event, he said that a couple of things have changed.
*  One is that there have been some policy breaks between the Trump base and Donald Trump
*  as a candidate.
*  One of the things that came up at the RNC was that Donald Trump embraced the vaccines.
*  And that's something this base did not like.
*  Trump was too progressive on...
*  Too pro-vaccine.
*  Vaccines and COVID.
*  Yes.
*  Too pro-vaccine.
*  Not everyone's understanding of the situation.
*  And among that group, Donald Trump was too pro-vaccine and too pro-COVID mandates while
*  in office.
*  And so I think if you want to think of it as like a kind of Frankenstein figure, the vaccine
*  is a moment where they realize they get sentience.
*  You know, that they realize that there is something maybe different than the person who made
*  them.
*  That's one break from him and that's a kind of political figure.
*  The other break that was really important was they were mentioning the speaker fight
*  in the house.
*  In the house.
*  And how when Kevin McCarthy was seeking to get the gavel for the Republican majority in
*  the house, remember Donald Trump endorsed him early.
*  But it was a GOP base that was led by Matt Gaetz, Lauren Bober, Fox figures like Tucker
*  Carlson at the time, who really went over the recommendation of Trump to maintain distance
*  from McCarthy and get more concessions out of them.
*  And when I was asking them about this, they said that this was another moment that became
*  clear to them that they are acting in their own America first priorities, that yes, that
*  overlaps with Donald Trump, but they're not scared to go past Donald Trump.
*  They're not scared to push Trump as a candidate in campaign and that the speaker fight was
*  a proof of that.
*  Right.
*  It seems like what you're describing is a moment where this is very intriguing to Trump's
*  grassroots base, this movement he's created, he is starting to seem a little bit like the
*  establishment, right?
*  Yes, absolutely.
*  I think this is again really critical nuance of Trump this version versus Trump previous
*  versions.
*  He's not been president for four years.
*  There's a lot of relationships that are mixed in with the GOP leadership and establishment.
*  These are all these little instances that created a distance between Donald Trump's grassroots
*  base and Donald Trump as a candidate and political figure.
*  And when we were at the RNC talking to folks in the crowd, there was a real openness to
*  seeing other candidates, one person who we talked to, I remember saying, I'm for anyone
*  who's America first.
*  They were seeing those priorities as really their political guiding light, not following
*  the specific personality of Donald Trump.
*  That's an important distinction, I think, to understand where this race started off
*  as.
*  You have a significant portion of Republicans who want a kind of America first message, but
*  that can be distinct from wanting Donald Trump.
*  And as part of the reason, DeSantis was showing a lot of real early promise in those post-midterm
*  stages.
*  Okay.
*  So at this moment, we have the grassroots unchastened by the midterm results, emboldened
*  even by them, not blaming Trump for them.
*  But we also have this group of voters saying we're kind of bigger than Trump and potentially
*  being open to an alternative like DeSantis.
*  So what's the significance of this when it comes to understanding how the party is going
*  to handle Donald Trump going forward?
*  Right.
*  An important thing to remember about the type of people who go to the RNC when it's
*  a meeting, the delegates that represent the Republican Party is that they're thinking
*  about what's best for the GOP at large.
*  And when you talk to these people, they say they have this really difficult task to navigate,
*  which is the reality that 30 to 35% of the party is unshakably with Donald Trump.
*  And they also have the reality that that is not enough people to win.
*  A general election.
*  That is not enough people to win a general election.
*  And more so than that, that the priorities of that 30 to 35% might be opposed to the type
*  of people that they need to win a general election.
*  And so when you talk to people about moving on from Donald Trump, they would hit you
*  with a kind of gut check.
*  How you doing?
*  I'm staying at a Henry Barber, nice to meet you.
*  I'm thinking about a man we talked to whose name is Henry Barber, the son of Governor
*  Hillen Barber.
*  The nephew of Governor Hillen Barber.
*  It's a big family.
*  Big family.
*  Oddly enough, I ended up becoming an RNC member in 05.
*  I've said pretty long times.
*  It's in the middle of the George W. administration.
*  That's so many different versions of the Republican Party.
*  How have you kind of maintained RNC credibility throughout all of those changes?
*  Well, we have all kinds of incredible members on the RNC.
*  I'm more of a political hack.
*  I'm real driven by one goal for the RNC.
*  And that's winning elections.
*  It's the only statistic that matters.
*  And he was someone who has really seen us a trusted figure about how does the party win
*  elections going forward.
*  And when we pose this question to him saying, how do you deal with the reality that the Trump
*  base might be losing you elections?
*  He says very clearly that being anti-Trump is a non-starter for Republicans.
*  Anybody who has a plan and the foundation of it is any Trump has gotten out of click
*  because that is a path to losing.
*  I know we need Donald Trump to be part of this, part of our success.
*  He's recognizing the reality that Donald Trump has so changed the issues that most Republican
*  voters prioritize, that there's no version of winning, particularly in a primary and even
*  in the general election that doesn't energize and activate that core base of people.
*  At the same time, that same group of people has caused the party to drift away from the
*  type of issues that motivate swing voters, that motivate the people in the middle who
*  really rejected them in the last midterm elections.
*  I think if you look at the 22 cycle, I think there's a lesson for the 24 cycle.
*  Our candidates who were focused on the future, who were focused on public policy did much,
*  much better in the 22 cycle than the candidates who were stuck in the past.
*  And particularly those who were just talking about 2020.
*  What Barbara is saying is that somehow the Republicans need to square that circle, need
*  to energize and activate the base, but at the same time, making sure that they aren't pushed
*  in directions that pull them further away from swing voters and cause them to lose.
*  To when Barbara says you need both, not either or.
*  So I want to have that Reagan-esque leader who we nominate in 2024, who brings us together,
*  who independence flock to, who moderate Democrats go, I'm voting for that guy because I want
*  the opportunity that this guy or the gal are offering.
*  If that leader comes through the primary, they will fall in line.
*  Yeah, and in the reality, look at 2016, that's what happened with Donald Trump.
*  The party followed behind him and I think the press wonders, we all are never going to
*  get rid of Donald Trump, you're never going to move on.
*  We're not trying to get rid of Donald Trump.
*  All we know is is we have to move forward together if we want to win.
*  You know, Trump can be part of this 24 victory, whether he's the nominee or not.
*  We need Donald Trump.
*  We need the people who love Donald Trump.
*  We need him to be part of the solution if we're going to win because if we don't come together,
*  I can assure you we're going to have Joe Biden for four more years and America ain't going to like that.
*  So rather than trying to find a way forward after these midterm losses without Trump,
*  rather than putting their fingers on the scale, maybe a little bit signaling it's time for someone
*  new, someone like DeSantis, the party's message in January is we want Trump and Trump supporters
*  to come with us on this forward looking journey.
*  And we want everyone else as well.
*  The question of course is how on earth do you do that because the components of that are very
*  contradictory? Absolutely. It was all vibes and those specifics.
*  But it said we're still left with this really intriguing situation that I want you to resolve
*  for us, which is that this grassroots base, it's still got a kind of weary relationship to
*  Trump himself, which you described earlier. Suddenly this grassroots base is feeling like
*  they don't need to do exactly what Trump says.
*  Yes. So how does that factor into this moment?
*  When we were talking to Trump supporters, even at the RNC, while they weren't publicly expressing
*  any problems with Trump and more blaming the kind of Republican establishment for the losses,
*  they were privately telling us that they do believe that the version of Donald Trump that came out
*  of the 2020 race and came into the 2022 midterms was much more focused on his own personal grievances
*  and settling the score of his own election loss rather than what I think they would often refer to
*  in shorthand as kind of 2016 version of Donald Trump, which was certainly grievance driven,
*  but representing a kind of larger community. He was a grieved on behalf of them.
*  A little guy. And whatever you think that is. Not just him. Not just him. It was a
*  manufacturing grievance. It was America first and economic sense. It was the wall grievance.
*  The wall grievance. It was all of that, but he was a vessel for a larger, unseen quote-unquote
*  forgotten American. They felt that that message had gotten lost from 2020 to 2022,
*  where it became about Donald Trump and his own election loss.
*  If they had a critique of him and how they wanted to see him shift heading into 2024,
*  what we were hearing in that kind of January period was they wanted to hear him back to being
*  refocused on their grievances, not his own. And so that was the kind of mandate we were hearing
*  from Trump supporters in that early period. Walking past like a table full of hats,
*  we've got let's go Brandon, Trump won, Trump. And we really see this like explicitly in early March
*  when we go to CPAC. Make America, Florida. Don't New York, my Florida.
*  The conservative political action conference, the big grassroots gathering of right-wing activists
*  that happens outside of Washington DC. Oh, the right stuff. This is a dating app for conservatives.
*  Nice. I'm sure it is pop in this weekend. And this is traditionally a bell weather of where the
*  energy on the presidential race is. What are your guys' names? Amanda, Jeannie Sylvia.
*  When we got there and talked to voters, they were expressing similar things to what we heard
*  at the RNC winter meeting. 100% he needs to just we all know. Yes, focus more on like what he's
*  going to do in the future and how he's going to make the country great again. That they were looking
*  to see if Donald Trump had moved past his personal grievances. What do you hope he talks about?
*  The economy. And when we were asking what did they want? That was really clear at the conference, too.
*  Close the border. I mean, and then also to get rid of this whole Russia and Ukraine war that's just
*  done. This would have never happened another him. A clear expression that the country is being
*  rested by liberal elites. There's only two genders and I don't like the drag shows are bringing
*  more kids to. That's not right. That's being threatened by progressive social movements like Black Lives
*  Matter or the growth of trans rights. Well, I think it's disgusting actually. And it's hurting our
*  kids and now the future. And so all of those became very clearly identifiable priorities for
*  this group that they were seeking the candidates reflect. And so when you got to Trump's speech,
*  which was the last thing to happen at that conference, the question I had going into the speech is
*  would this be a candidate that reflects those priorities? Would this be a candidate that understands
*  that there is a gap, a weakness, a distance between him and the base he so associated with?
*  And would he reflect what they were asking him to do, which was close that gap?
*  And I think when we heard that speech, for seven years you and I have been engaged in an
*  epic struggle to rescue our country from the people who hate it and want to absolutely destroy it.
*  It was a box checking one by one of those priorities. I will refoke everybody in policy promoting
*  the chemical castration and sexual mobilization. You heard Donald Trump go through the type of
*  cultural grievances they were concerned about. We will teach our values and promote our history
*  and our traditions to our children. We will, in other words, be proud of our country again.
*  Make clear he was the champion of their expression of America first. We'll be stopping the slide into
*  costly and never ending wars. We're going to stop it. Can't keep spending.
*  And when you hear those things in the context of the conference, I think it has a different resonance.
*  In 2016 I declared I am your voice. Today I add I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who
*  have been wronged and betrayed. I am your retribution. I am your retribution.
*  Let's take the I am your retribution line that got such national attention from that speech.
*  In isolation, you hear a candidate promising to use the powers of the federal government to attack
*  their opponents. But when you're in that context, you hear a little more than that. You hear him
*  saying that those grievances you reflect, I understand and I will prioritize when given power.
*  So it's not just a scatter shot expression from him. It is a specific response to a base that was
*  calling for him to be their vessel. That's what they wanted from Donald Trump. And that's what they
*  heard at CPAC. And we will make America great again.
*  So when we think about the journey we've been on that starts at the RNC with the grassroots saying
*  that they have some concerns about Trump. They have some low level weariness.
*  This is a big milestone moment in that journey because Trump is saying back to them,
*  I've heard you. I've heard your wearing this. I've heard some of your concerns. And he's saying,
*  my grievances are your grievances once again. I can adjust. I can be this thing you need me to be.
*  And he seems like he's doing that pretty successfully. Right. Exactly. It's that time of year again,
*  Jim. The poll that gets it all started.
*  And this bond between candidate and base is most clearly expressed in the straw poll that comes
*  out of CPAC. This is a kind of tradition that happens at this conference where they informally
*  ask the attendees who they want their presidential nominee to be. And Trump was always the favorite
*  to win this straw poll. But this year, the numbers kind of speak for themselves. You saw him
*  really clobber to Sanctus 62 to 20 over round to Sanctus. President Trump gets 62%.
*  And it's not as if the people there hated round to Sanctus. The people we talk to who are at CPAC
*  frankly thought round to Sanctus was a great governor that they thought understood their grievances.
*  But they felt that that did not add up to a reason to ditch Donald Trump.
*  And I think even more importantly, that really doesn't add up to a reason to ditch Donald Trump
*  when Donald Trump is reflecting their priorities and doing so at that conference. And so,
*  whereas I think after the midterms, there was even a question of just, okay, what is the starting point?
*  For Trump's support. I think already by early March, that curiosity was already feeling
*  like it was starting to shift. That even if someone assumed that the midterms would be kind of
*  fatal for Trump, it was not.
*  We'll be right back.
*  I said, we just talked about this idea that the Trump base, 30, 35% of the Republican electorate,
*  has now been resolidified behind Trump. And that seems very much at odds with the idea that
*  has now become conventional wisdom that Trump is looking more or less inevitable to be
*  re-nominated as the Republican presidential candidate. Because that actually leaves a huge
*  percentage of the Republican electorate still up for grabs.
*  Yeah. And I think it's because we have to understand these numbers in the more specific way.
*  When you have 30 to 35% of the Trump base, of course that leaves 65, maybe 70% of people who are,
*  we will categorize in that construction as anti-Trump. When you look under the hood, that 65,
*  70% dislikes Trump for very different reasons. They can include moderates who think that he is a
*  kind of scary political figure from an ideological perspective. They include people who dislike him
*  from a kind of personality driven perspective and have no problem with how far to the right he is.
*  And so the reasons they are anti-Trump are sometimes in conflict. And so the challenge for someone
*  who is trying to put together a coalition of those people is how do you cobble together a big
*  enough percentage while at the same time uniting them under one banner and under one candidate?
*  In your reporting, how have you seen this challenge of a Republican candidate trying to cobble
*  together these disparate elements of the anti-Trump coalition? How have you kind of seen that play out?
*  Mm-hmm. I think this is where Ron DeSantis is really helpful figure to look at because he is
*  someone who has done the most explicit appeals to all sides of the Republican party.
*  We have maintained law and order. We have respected our taxpayers and we reject
*  woke ideology. He is trying to appeal to the market base. Florida is where woke goes to die.
*  He is trying to appeal to moderates.
*  Governing is not about building a brand or talking on social media and virtue signaling.
*  It's ultimately about winning and about producing results.
*  By saying that he would not bring the drama that the Trump president see brought.
*  No, it goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some type of alleged
*  affair. I just, I can't speak to that.
*  The problem is that's much easier said in the abstract and in the specifics.
*  When you look at things like, for example, show the Republican nominee be support of a more
*  A to Ukraine, that's something that really splits those group of people. And you saw this really
*  challenge. Ron DeSantis. He put out a statement saying he did not feel Ukraine should be a strategic
*  priority. And that got real blowback from the donor class, from candidates like Mike Pence and
*  Nikki Haley. And specifically because they know that that's at odds with the type of voters on
*  one side of the ledger that he needs to get. That's the challenge of the coalition building. You end
*  up pissing off one side or the other or creating openings for your opponents to seize on. It is why
*  Donald Trump remains a front runner even with a minority of support is because his 30 to 35
*  percent of people are ideologically homogenous and unified around his message.
*  Right. Because someone like Mara Sanchez, it looks so easy on paper. Get 36% of the
*  Republicans based, but you're saying that's so much harder to do in reality because of an issue
*  like Ukraine, which looks like it might get you X percent, but then it pisses off Y percent,
*  or maybe actually that just canceled itself out. Right. Exactly. But what about DeSantis' anti-woke
*  campaign? It's kind of the signature of the DeSantis emerging candidacy. And that really did look
*  like a very savvy place to focus. Yeah. It's not Ukraine. Yeah. It's something that many Republicans
*  pulling to just can get behind. Yeah. Absolutely. And this is the reason why Ron DeSantis is not
*  one of the also rants in this race because he has found an issue that gets a lot of Republicans
*  on board. And because he has distinguished himself from the other candidates as being someone
*  who will follow through on said priority. And so when Ron DeSantis lands on his anti-wokeness
*  campaign, he is speaking the language of this Republican party. They are seeking a candidate
*  that speaks ingredients, that speaks in retribution, that's willing to use the federal government
*  to prioritize those goals. And what DeSantis' campaign does is place himself in that language.
*  And so that is the good part for Ron DeSantis. Yeah. That's a bad part. Is that?
*  That is not a message that's in conflict with Donald Trump. Right. It's kind of an echo.
*  Yeah. It's the language of the party. But if he comes to language of the party because Donald Trump
*  has partially made it so. So if you're a voter whose biggest priority is grievance, right?
*  It's the way to make that most true in your next Republican nominee voting for the guy who's
*  going to attack Disney or is the biggest sense of retribution bringing Donald Trump back.
*  Right. Because ultimately Trumpism and DeSantisism have called that.
*  Our can coexist. Well, they're just two slightly different forms of cultural conservatism and
*  grievance. But they're not so different that a Trump-based grassroots person is going to look
*  over in DeSantis and say, yeah, I need to ditch Trump for that. Right. Exactly. And so do some
*  Republican see the flaw of DeSantis is that he's just trying to defeat Trump by running on the
*  issues that Trump himself brought to the floor. Yeah. And this is what you have seen in reporting,
*  coming from DeSantis donors and other people who've kind of made the argument that he has lost
*  this kind of electability argument to say that I would win and Trump would lose because he's
*  playing in Donald Trump's sandbox. Okay. But what about a candidate running for the Republican
*  voters that don't like Trumpism and that as a result is a candidate not playing in Trump's
*  sandbox? Are you saying that cultural grievances now run so deep within the Republican Party that
*  there isn't a lane for that kind of candidate who wants to focus on issues like the economy and
*  diplomacy, not trans rights. That's exactly what I'm saying. I'm saying literally not
*  enough Republicans exist who prioritize those type of issues for someone to run exclusively in
*  that lane and win the nomination. The party has changed in such a way that the type of people you
*  would need to make that candidate nominee, they've become independence. Some of them have become
*  Democrats. They've left the party. There's just not enough of them. And so there's question that
*  keeps getting asked over and over about when do Republicans turn the page on Donald Trump? It is a
*  useless question. You want it banned? I want it banned. There is no universe where that happens
*  even if he loses. He can lose. And whoever that is, if it's around the centers or someone else,
*  would have to bring Trumpism along. But I said, don't we have to consider the possibility
*  that Trumpism might have to go on without Trump because of the legal situation that he now finds
*  himself in. We haven't talked about it that much in this episode, but he's been indicted in
*  New York over the Hush Money Payment investigation. We know that the district attorney in
*  Georgia is talking about potentially inditing Trump by the end of the summer.
*  And there's a possibility Trump goes to jail in either of these cases. So how does that factor
*  into all of this? And doesn't it mean that this is not just a theoretical question of Trump
*  and Trumpism needing to separate like a court and a judge might make it happen pretty soon?
*  Yeah, absolutely. I think we definitely need to think about that possibility because it's the
*  largest live ball that's still left in the race. To your point, we have the very real possibility
*  that Donald Trump could be criminally convicted as these indictments roll down. And at the same time,
*  it's really created a political problem for the race for the other candidates who are not named
*  Donald Trump. There was this kind of assumption, I think before the race started that the legal
*  problems that Trump faced would do the work for them would cause him to lose support among Republicans,
*  would make him to bloody and bruise to be a viable presidential candidate. But what we saw after
*  the New York criminal indictment came down was that Donald Trump was raising more money. Was that
*  some level of voters were coming back to him after he was attacked that it fed into his narrative
*  of victimhood and the idea that the federal government was trying to use its powers to shut him down.
*  And so the assumption that it would fall off support from Trump just hasn't become true. And I
*  think that's particularly important for the two main candidates in this race for Ron DeSantis.
*  There's a subtle premise to his campaign that if Trump were to not be there, say because of
*  these legal challenges or because of a conviction that DeSantis is the natural next step for where his
*  supporters go. But the Trump campaign thinks the exact opposite effect is going to happen.
*  That as more of these indictments come down, it becomes harder to remove Donald Trump because more
*  and more Republicans will rally around him. It's two different ideas and assumptions about how the
*  legal problems and indictments can scramble the race. And they're all based on just best guesses
*  because we're in such uncharted territory. We really have no idea how this is going to play out.
*  So DeSantis's position here is really interesting. He might be running against Trump directly. And
*  he's also positioning himself for the possibility of running in place of Trump. In which case,
*  he has to be respectful of Trump, respectful enough so that they can stand there and operate as his
*  political heir. It's a legitimately difficult tightrope. I mean, we should not underplay that.
*  And when you talk to Trump supporters, you see why? You'll ask them about Ron DeSantis and they will
*  say largely positive things about him that he's kind of there. Number two, if we could think kind of
*  ranked choice voting style, but they will also say that if someone becomes anti Trump or if
*  Ron DeSantis positions himself as someone who's making what they would believe is kind of like
*  liberal arguments against Trump, that would make him an enemy, not an ally in the kind of overall
*  war of Trump politics. And so if you're on DeSantis, your kind of dream version of the race is one where
*  you are naturally handed the baton to the Trump coalition. But the reality has been that core
*  support has stuck with Donald Trump. And to me, this adds up to a really important point because
*  what we're really talking about here is what are the terms in which this presidential race will be
*  run on? I think for a lot of people, the last time they were plugged into politics was the night
*  of midterm elections where they saw a country send a unified message to both parties to reject
*  extremism on the Republican side to make clear that issues like election denial and conspiracy
*  were a step too far to really ask the political system to turn the page on Trumpism. And I think
*  for a lot of people, there is a uncomfortable reality that is about to hit them that that system
*  is set to ignore that message. And we are set to deal with another year and a half on the same
*  kind of terms of Trump and Trumpism, no matter who the Republican nominee is, because that is so
*  in strength now. That's so at the core of all of our national politics. And I think the big golf
*  between what people said they wanted in the midterms and what people are about to get in this
*  presidential race is going to drive home that disconnect really clearly.
*  Thank you very much. Thank you.

*  Here's what else you need to know today. Over the weekend, Russia appeared to effectively win
*  control of the Ukrainian city of Bogdmude, the scene of the deadliest battle in the 15-month war.
*  If Russian troops can hold the Eastern city, it would mark Russia's most successful battlefield
*  since last summer. On Sunday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said that no matter what happens
*  to the city, quote, there is nothing of Bogdmude left after months of fierce fighting there.
*  Meanwhile, in response to the newest round of U.S. sanctions against Russia, Russian president Vladimir
*  Putin has sanctioned Americans who are perceived as enemies of Donald Trump, the latest evidence
*  that Russia favors Trump over President Biden in the next U.S. election.
*  Among the 500 people that Russia sanctioned were Letitia James, the state attorney general of
*  New York, who has investigated and sued Trump, Brad Raffensberger, the Secretary of State of Georgia,
*  who rebuffed Trump's effort to reverse the result of the 2020 election, and Lieutenant Michael
*  Bird, the U.S. Capitol Police Officer, who shot a pro-Trump rioter on January 6th.
