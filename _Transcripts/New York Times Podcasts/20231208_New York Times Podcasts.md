# Biden Is Trying to Rein In Israel. Is It Working?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9KpJJB8wvI)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. This is The Daily.
*  Over the past eight weeks, what started as unwavering public support of Israel from President
*  Biden and his cabinet has now given way to something else.
*  Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.
*  Frankly the scale of civilian suffering and the images and videos coming from Gaza are
*  devastating.
*  Growing skepticism of Israel's approach.
*  The way Israel defends itself matters.
*  It is capable of neutralizing the threat posed by Hamas while minimizing harm to innocent
*  men, women and children.
*  And it has an obligation to do so.
*  But at times, open disapproval of its tactics.
*  I have repeatedly made clear to Israel's leaders that protecting Palestinian civilians in Gaza
*  is both a moral responsibility and a strategic imperative.
*  Today, Chief White House Correspondent Peter Baker reports on the public and private ways
*  that the Biden White House is trying to influence Israel's conduct and whether it's working.
*  It's Friday, December 8th.
*  Peter, good morning.
*  I just want to explain where you are as best I can tell.
*  You seem to be at the White House in the kind of room where somebody might walk by and say
*  something.
*  I am.
*  Good morning.
*  I'm at the White House.
*  I'm in a broom closet we call the press room.
*  And we have pool duty today.
*  So I'm here to follow the president around whatever he ends up doing.
*  Right.
*  So if there's some ambient noise, that's the cost of working out of the White House.
*  Yeah, I'm afraid so.
*  So we wanted to talk to you, Peter, as a White House correspondent, because over the past
*  week or so, as the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has ended, and this war has resumed
*  in a very fierce way, the way that the Biden administration, the way the White House talks
*  about Israel and specifically how Israel is conducting its war against Hamas has changed
*  in a very conspicuous way.
*  Well, it has.
*  You're right.
*  You've heard in the last few days, the vice president, the secretary of state, secretary
*  of defense issuing much sharper warnings to Israel that they have a responsibility to
*  avoid civilian casualties and not just they have a responsibility, but they aren't living
*  up to that responsibility.
*  It's a much different emphasis.
*  And it represents, I think, the frustrations about how these realities have been conducting
*  the war, that there's just too many civilian casualties, there's too much bloodshed and
*  that these images are hurting both Israel and the United States around the world.
*  These are not people who are responsible for the October 7th attack, but are paying the
*  price for it.
*  And that's something that the United States, that the Biden administration is increasingly
*  upset about, that this is not good on the ground and it's not good around the world.
*  Right.
*  And that change in tone really stands out because it is so profoundly different from
*  the way that this president and this White House and administration talked about this
*  war at the very start in the days after the October 7th attacks inside of Israel.
*  And that's where I really want to start with you, kind of understanding the president's
*  journey from there to here.
*  So just kind of take us back to the beginning.
*  Well, at the beginning, of course, on October 7th, President Biden was essentially in Israel's
*  corner.
*  Good afternoon.
*  Today, the people of Israel are under attack.
*  He came out in the beginning and said, The United States stands with Israel.
*  We will not ever fail to have their back.
*  You know, I am with Israel.
*  And not only that, he just understood and viscerally expressed the trauma and the outrage
*  and the pain that Israelis were feeling.
*  Innocent people murdered, wounded, entire families taken hostage by Hamas.
*  And he was just reciting one atrocity after another.
*  It was not an antiseptic description of what had happened.
*  It was a very personal view on his part.
*  And Jill and I are praying for those families who have been impacted by this violence.
*  We grieve with those who have lost their loved ones, lost a piece of their soul.
*  And within a few days, he jumps on the plane, jumps on Air Force One.
*  I'm actually with him on that plane during that trip to fly all the way across the world
*  to Israel.
*  Mr. Prime Minister, I'm very happy to be back in Israel with you.
*  Why is he going that far?
*  He's going there to give them a hug, almost in a literal sense.
*  He literally hugs Bibi Netanyahu on Carmack.
*  I want to say to the people of Israel, their courage, their commitment, their bravery is stunning.
*  And he hugs the Israeli people and he says, I'm with you.
*  This is Joe Biden at his empathetic best.
*  It's also Joe Biden at his most pro-Israel, which, of course, is a different point of
*  view than a lot of Democrats have these days.
*  Well, let's talk about that.
*  I mean, on some level, the president being supportive of Israel after a terror attack
*  isn't all that surprising, given the United States' historic alliance with the country.
*  But as you're hinting at, it felt for Biden personal on a level.
*  And you could hear that in his speeches and in these literal and figurative hugs.
*  Where does that come from?
*  Where does that come from?
*  Well, first of all, you have to remember that Joe Biden is of a different generation than
*  most Americans and most of his fellow Democrats.
*  He is of the generation where people talked about the Holocaust at the dining room table.
*  His father talked to him about America's failure to do more to stop the Holocaust early on
*  and how that was shameful of the world, allowed that to happen.
*  This is something that Joe Biden grew up with.
*  And when he gets to the Senate, he often told the story and he tells it now almost every day.
*  I told the story before and I'll tell it again of my first meeting with an Israeli prime
*  minister 50 years ago as a young senator.
*  Going to Israel in 1973.
*  Just before the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
*  He meets Golda Maier and how she's the famous prime minister of Israel.
*  Without her looking at me, she said to me, knowing I'd hear her, why do you look so worried,
*  Senator Biden?
*  And I said, worried?
*  Like, of course I'm worried.
*  When he says he's worried about the Jewish people, she tells him, don't worry, Senator.
*  We Israelis have a secret weapon.
*  We have nowhere else to go.
*  Don't worry about us.
*  We have nowhere else to go.
*  And he takes a lot of meaning from that.
*  So he's been talking about this for a long time.
*  Right.
*  In fact, he recites that story about Golda Maier during his recent trip to Israel as
*  if to say, I come here as somebody with a lot of personal connection and rapport with
*  this country.
*  I'm not a newcomer.
*  Absolutely.
*  He has said, and he said that on that trip, you don't have to be Jewish to be a Zionist.
*  That's quite a statement to make.
*  Obviously, Joe Biden is not Jewish, but he expresses a real connection to the Israeli
*  project and it's a way you don't hear from more modern Democrats.
*  It's not something you hear from younger members of the party.
*  This is something born of his time and he has not changed in that way.
*  He is a big supporter of Israel going back from the beginning.
*  And that's come to this moment.
*  But I caution this while you feel that rage.
*  Don't be consumed by it.
*  But in that same speech, he also issues his caution.
*  After 9-11, we were enraged in the United States.
*  While we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.
*  He says, I understand your rage.
*  I understand your feelings.
*  We had the same thing at 9-11, but don't make the mistake that we made after 9-11.
*  I made wartime decisions.
*  I know the choices are never clear or easy for leadership.
*  There's always cost.
*  But it requires being deliberate.
*  It requires asking very hard questions.
*  And what he's saying in effect is don't go too far, right?
*  That you will lose the world.
*  Right now you have the world's sympathy.
*  If you respond with excess, if you respond too aggressively, then you will lose that.
*  He's clearly referring to the Iraq War.
*  He doesn't say that in the speech, but that's clearly the inference.
*  And remember, he had voted for that as a senator and came to regret it.
*  Right.
*  And it felt like he was anticipating that Israel might react in a way that required
*  such a warning.
*  It didn't feel like a warning issue just for the sake of a warning.
*  It felt like Biden was saying, I know you're about to respond with extraordinary force.
*  Yeah, it didn't come out of the blue.
*  Everybody understands Israel's history.
*  The history of Israel is to respond with overpowering force.
*  It's their doctrine.
*  You come after us, we will come after you 10 times as hard.
*  And the reason, of course, is to establish a sense of deterrence so that people don't
*  do it again.
*  And Biden knew this, but he also knew that that overwhelming force had a cost.
*  And the cost would be on the ground in terms of civilian lives and the cost would be internationally
*  in terms of Israel's position in the world.
*  Right.
*  And in fact, even at that point where Biden is issuing this warning, Israel has already
*  started a pretty major bombardment of airstrikes in Gaza.
*  So I'm curious how Biden starts to marry this public support of Israel with a kind of enforcement
*  of this warning he's issued.
*  How does he start to ensure that Israel is going to heed his admonition not to, in a
*  sense, overreact?
*  Part of the effect of his hug of Bibi Netanyahu and the Israeli government is to build up
*  the credibility to then say, I'm on your side.
*  You know how much I'm on your side.
*  So here's my private advice about how you go about doing it.
*  And my private advice is be careful.
*  And in Israel, they actually call it the bear hug.
*  And by the bear hug in Hebrew, the bear hug isn't just a hug of affection.
*  It's a hug of I'm controlling you a little bit.
*  Right.
*  And that's how they see Biden.
*  That's the strategy that he's applying here.
*  No daylight in public, but listen to me behind the scenes because you know I have your back
*  and I'm the only guy who has your back like this.
*  And so he begins to apply pressure.
*  Right.
*  He begins to say, you know, are you really sure you want to do it this way?
*  He doesn't do questions, by the way, at first.
*  He does sort of a Socratic thing.
*  Is this really the way you've done it?
*  What have you thought through about the next day?
*  What about this?
*  What about that?
*  And in doing so, of course, telling them how he thinks they should go forward.
*  So these are conversations that the president is having, conversations, it sounds like,
*  that are filled with Socratic questions.
*  I assume with the prime minister of Israel, Bibi Netanyahu.
*  Yes.
*  In fact, they're talking like all the time, especially at first.
*  I mean, I think they've talked more than a dozen times in the first six, seven weeks
*  of this crisis.
*  And it's not just him.
*  He is sending one administration official after another to Israel to basically hold
*  their hand.
*  I mean, it's almost like there's never a moment when there isn't a senior administration
*  official on the ground there.
*  Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, a senior general, the CIA director, whatever.
*  And the idea seems to be we are with you, but we are literally going to be in the room
*  here and we're going to be looking over your shoulder in a sense.
*  They want to be in the room, not just hearing about things afterwards.
*  Well talk about some of the moments and some of the strategies where we can understand
*  specific attempts by the United States to shape Israel's response during this conflict.
*  The first and most important priority for the Biden team is to keep the war from expanding
*  beyond Gaza to other parts of the region.
*  That's the thing that President Biden fears the most in those early days.
*  And in those early days, there was real uncertainty about how this could blow up.
*  There was Hezbollah in southern Lebanon tossing rockets across the border at the Israelis.
*  There's some sentiment in Israel to go ahead and go after them as well.
*  That really launch a new war against southern Lebanon and Hezbollah.
*  They have a hundred thousand some rockets aimed at them there.
*  And the Biden team doesn't want that.
*  They do not want to widen this war.
*  What Biden does is he says, look, you worry about Hamas.
*  I'll take care of Hezbollah because I'm going to send two carriers groups to the region
*  and they will see that if they get involved in this war in a big way, they're going to
*  have to answer to us, to the United States.
*  And that basically talks the Israelis out of expanding and escalating this war beyond
*  Gaza.
*  That's the number one most important priority for Biden coming in.
*  Right.
*  That strategy from the U.S. seems to have largely been effective.
*  It hasn't expanded into a regional conflict.
*  Right.
*  OK.
*  Where else do we see the U.S. pressure?
*  Well, another place where we see it is how Israel delays the beginning of the ground
*  war, right?
*  It doesn't go immediately over the border into Gaza as much as I think there is a desire
*  to do that.
*  Biden says, wait a second before you do it, think it through.
*  What are you going to do here?
*  What do you do about civilians?
*  What are you going to do the day after?
*  And so instead of just jumping right into a ground war, Israel warns civilians to get
*  out of the way.
*  It begins telling them head into the south and that's where you'll be safe.
*  It isn't adequate as far as a lot of their critics go.
*  It isn't adequate as far as a lot of human rights groups would tell you.
*  But it's something that Biden, I think, pushes them into doing and he affects their game
*  plan from the start.
*  So when we think about that moment when Israel is massing troops on the border and is about,
*  it very much seems, to invade Gaza, but instead delays it and starts issuing these massive
*  evacuation orders of Gazan civilians from the north to the south, you're saying behind
*  the scenes, President Biden, the administration is very much playing a huge role in why that
*  happens.
*  Right, very much.
*  They're not dictating.
*  They understand that dictating is not a good idea with Israelis, not going to take it well,
*  but they're just really pushing on the consequences if they don't do it this way.
*  Now, if you do it, we can tell you how this goes.
*  They say we were in Fallujah, we were in Mosul, and we can give you advice.
*  They send in fact, a general who was in Iraq to tell the Israelis about their American
*  experiences doing this kind of really tough urban warfare to give them a sense of what
*  they have ahead of them and to make sure that they have thought it through enough before
*  they get started.
*  Right.
*  They're also, of course, pushing Israel on humanitarian aid and this is a tough moment.
*  Israel says at first they're going to blockade Gaza and not allow any food, water, fuel into
*  the enclave and the Americans are saying, no, no, that's unacceptable.
*  That's too far.
*  You cannot do that.
*  in effect over getting more humanitarian, getting any humanitarian aid in and eventually
*  they start to get some and not nearly enough according to the to the groups, but they begin
*  to get trucks through the Rafa crossing and you begin to see some led up by the Israelis
*  on this grudgingly and unhappily because they worry that any supplies helps Hamas, not necessarily
*  the civilians, but eventually the Biden team pushes them into allowing more humanitarian
*  aid.
*  Right.
*  And I think that's how far the Biden administration is able to influence things.
*  I mean, just look at the airstrikes.
*  They're so overwhelming, so powerful, right?
*  Even if you don't credit the exact numbers issued by the Hamas run health ministry in
*  Gaza, clearly there are thousands and thousands of civilians who have died here because of
*  these airstrikes.
*  So how surgical are they really?
*  I think the Americans would have preferred a more surgical approach that would hit Hamas
*  and destroy that group without hitting so many civilians.
*  But it's hard to say how you do that, right?
*  Because Hamas is so integrated into the community and distinguishing between the two obviously
*  has been hard, but the Americans have been very frustrated, I think, behind the scenes
*  at how heavy the toll has been among the civilian casualties of those airstrikes.
*  Right.
*  This has got to be the single biggest source of American frustration.
*  The fact that Israel's aerial bombardment especially has produced such staggeringly
*  high levels of civilian deaths in Gaza.
*  At this point, the health ministry in Gaza puts that number at well over 15,000, which
*  includes combatants and civilians, thousands of which Hamas says are children.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  And it's a concern for the Biden team, not just because of the obvious emotion of watching
*  people who didn't have anything to do with the attack of October 7th pay a price for
*  it, but also because they know that internationally it costs Israel support.
*  And domestically here as well, right?
*  It's cost Biden support among his fellow Democrats who are watching what's happening in Gaza
*  with great concern, great upset, sometimes great outrage, and their outrage of Biden
*  for not doing more to rein in the Israelis.
*  So he's under a great deal of pressure from all sides.
*  Right.
*  I mean, another friction point, a really important friction point is what happens the day after,
*  right?
*  When Hamas is destroyed, for what have you, when Israel is done with its war, at least
*  the main part of the war, what comes next?
*  How do you govern Gaza?
*  You can't allow Hamas to be in charge anymore, but who then takes over?
*  And there's a real difference of opinion between Washington and Jerusalem about this.
*  You know, President Biden's been pretty straightforward, even in public saying, do not reoccupy Gaza.
*  That's not a good idea.
*  And he wants to see the Palestinian Authority, which governs at least in part the West Bank,
*  take over Gaza in some sort of revitalized version, he says.
*  And that's not where Bibi Netanyahu and most Israeli government officials are.
*  They don't trust the Palestinian Authority.
*  They don't think much of it.
*  And they don't like the idea of anybody else being in charge.
*  Bibi Netanyahu said in public, I don't think there's anybody other than the IDF who can
*  be in charge in Gaza when the war part of this is over.
*  So there are real loggerheads over that.
*  Right.
*  I mean, that is a moment where Netanyahu openly defies President Biden's wishes here because
*  he goes on TV, and I think he's now done it twice, and said Israel will play a major role
*  in the security of Gaza, which to many sounds a lot like Israel will control Gaza.
*  And to some, it sounds like Israel will occupy Gaza.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you know, it's not clear that necessarily means occupation because you have heard Israelis
*  say we don't want to get back in the way we used to.
*  They pulled out, of course, in 2005, but they plan to control it.
*  What does that mean, control it?
*  We don't know whether it might be some kind of forced relocation.
*  That's something the Biden administration has made very clear they're against.
*  So there's a real friction point there, and that's going to come to a head at some point.
*  So the question of day after is another way in which Biden has realized the limitations
*  of his influence over this conflict.
*  Right, exactly.
*  But that's a long-term issue.
*  In the short term, there's so many others on the table, including, for instance, the
*  hostages, really important priority for the president.
*  And he does manage to convince Bibi Netanyahu to pause the fighting in order to have an
*  exchange in effect with Hamas.
*  This is an important deal that he brokers.
*  It takes weeks.
*  He points a secret cell of negotiators working with Qatar, the Gulf Emirate, which is friendly
*  with both Hamas and the United States.
*  President himself is getting on the phone with Netanyahu and with the emir of Qatar
*  to break the last kind of obstacles to this.
*  And they do have a deal.
*  They do pause the fighting for basically a week or so in order to release some of the
*  hostages.
*  About 110 hostages get out, mainly women and children.
*  But there's still another 100 or so in captivity, including a number of Americans.
*  And at some point, this hostages deal breaks down.
*  Hamas refuses to put more women on the list.
*  And to the extent that the Americans had hoped this pause in fighting would give them some
*  breathing room to allow more humanitarian aid in and to maybe shape the next phase of
*  the combat, maybe even to see if the combat might not have to resume quite at the same
*  level.
*  That's the test for the Biden strategy here.
*  Right.
*  I recall understanding from coverage that you wrote, Peter, during this period that
*  the United States saw the ceasefire, the pause in fighting during the hostage deal as a chance
*  to reshape the war.
*  And that was the hope.
*  And then the resumption occurs.
*  And my strong sense is that they don't quite feel that that is what happens.
*  No, in fact, they specifically say, don't go into southern Gaza where you have told
*  everybody to go flee for their safety and then start indiscriminately bombing again.
*  And they push the Israelis to say you need to do more tactical, more targeted kind of
*  strikes, be more surgical about what you do.
*  And the Israelis basically, they take some of this to heart.
*  They do, you know, issue some maps saying here are some safe places for civilians to
*  But otherwise, they basically go into the south in full force.
*  And the war suddenly that had paused for a number of days and giving everybody kind of
*  a chance to catch their breath is back on full bore.
*  And suddenly we're back where we were before the hostage exchange.
*  And this is an important pivot point.
*  That's when you begin to see senior administration officials almost like in a chorus begin in
*  public to really ratchet up the pressure on Israel.
*  They need to stop doing things the way they were doing them.
*  You're hearing them say you heard Secretary of State Tony Blinken say they can't do in
*  the south what they did in the north.
*  We need to have a different way of approaching it.
*  You hear Lloyd Austin saying, look, if you go after the Palestinian civilians, all you're
*  doing is radicalizing them and creating a whole new generation of enemies.
*  And this is a very different tone than you heard from the Biden administration for the
*  first seven, eight weeks.
*  Right.
*  Suddenly the public rhetoric from the Biden administration is starting to, it seems more
*  accurately, reflect the private pressure that the president has been putting on Israel.
*  Exactly.
*  And the assumption is that's because the Israelis aren't listening to the private messaging
*  anymore.
*  And so by taking it public, you are reinforcing your point and pushing them even harder.
*  We'll be right back.
*  The week long truce between Israel and Hamas is over.
*  Israel says it has resumed combat operations and says Hamas, quote, violated the operational
*  pause and in addition fired toward Israeli territory.
*  The new Israeli airstrikes raining down on Gaza overnight after the temporary ceasefire
*  collapse, the death toll climbing in Gaza.
*  Israel pounded the south of Gaza today, the same region they had told Palestinians in
*  the north to evacuate to.
*  The Israeli army says it's engaged in the heaviest fighting since it began its ground
*  invasion five weeks ago.
*  About 170,000 people in Khan Unis have been warned to leave for safety.
*  But a spokesman for the UN Children's Charity, UNICEF, says there's nowhere safe for people
*  to go.
*  So Peter, the post-hostage deal, post ceasefire, Israeli assault of southern Gaza.
*  Israeli has not so far seemed to conform to the wishes of the American government.
*  And that makes me want to understand if President Biden wanted to pressure Israel much further
*  on issues like reducing civilian deaths, what tools does the president and his administration
*  have at their disposal to really do that?
*  Beyond Socratic questions and evening phone calls with Netanyahu saying, I'd like you
*  to do this a little bit differently and beyond the public statements that Biden's deputies
*  are now making.
*  How much further could Biden go?
*  Well, I mean, the administration, the Americans have extraordinary influence tools if they
*  want to use them.
*  First of all, of course, the United States is the main supplier for Israel's military
*  operation at this point.
*  They need American interceptors for their anti-missile batteries.
*  They need American ammunition.
*  They need American arms.
*  And I think that that is a huge instrument if the Biden administration wanted to use
*  it. Now, they're not using it in a public way.
*  There is some suggestion as to maybe quietly whether they're holding back or delaying certain
*  shipments. But publicly, they are not conditioning arm supplies with any kind of demands about
*  how the war be conducted.
*  But you're hearing Democrats say that in Congress, who are talking about this 14 billion
*  dollars that President Biden has asked for for additional aid.
*  A lot of Democrats saying, well, why don't we attach conditions to that, very explicit
*  conditions about how they conduct the war.
*  And so far, the Biden administration hasn't ruled that out, but hasn't gone along with
*  that either.
*  What this makes clear is that Biden does have meaningful leverage over Israel in this conflict
*  if he wants to use it.
*  And I think what this seems to reveal is a bit of a paradox at the center of what the
*  Biden administration is up to in this war.
*  It says it wants to support Israel in its objective of defeating Hamas and increasingly
*  makes clear it wants to limit civilian deaths, but it's not willing to do anything to lower
*  civilian deaths that might jeopardize Israel's objective in defeating Hamas.
*  And therefore, civilian deaths are going to keep growing.
*  So basically, these two stated U.S. goals just do not seem compatible at the moment.
*  Well, they're definitely in conflict.
*  They do not want to undermine Israel.
*  Obviously, they are very straightforwardly on Israel's side here.
*  But they are very concerned that the civilian casualties are excessive and that they don't
*  want to cost Israel's standing in the world.
*  They are the one country that stands by Israel time and time again when the rest of the world
*  is condemning them.
*  They're the ones that block Security Council resolutions of the United Nations that are
*  blasting Israel.
*  They're the ones who supply them the arms.
*  So the United States has such a unique relationship with Israel.
*  It is both a partner and in some way is a mentor.
*  So it's a symbiotic relationship in that way.
*  This is why Biden can, in fact, do what he has done to influence things, but he does
*  not want to go so far as to seem to undercut them.
*  And it's a balancing act that some people would say, you know, would argue about whether
*  he's been successful at.
*  But that's the treacherous territory is in.
*  I just want to make sure I understand what you're saying, because it feels important.
*  Biden feels confident that a relationship in which he's at the table having these calls
*  with Netanyahu and able to apply private pressure, even when it's not all that effective, is
*  a better scenario than one in which he threw pressure, perhaps too much pressure in the
*  eyes of Israel, alienates it and has no influence over the way it conducts this war.
*  That's the calculation.
*  Yes, exactly right.
*  If you talk to administration officials, what you hear them say is if we didn't support
*  them, they would do this anyway.
*  They wouldn't be moderating in any fashion.
*  They would find other ways.
*  They have their own weapons.
*  They would go to other places to get weapons if they had to.
*  They would do whatever was necessary.
*  So from Biden's point of view, rightly or wrongly, it's better to be at the table and
*  be able to have some influence than to be on the outside without any.
*  But is there a point, Peter, based on your reporting on this president and your larger
*  reporting on the history of America's relationship with Israel and the world, where this conflict
*  we're talking about and the calculations that Biden is making, they just might change, where
*  he might decide that the civilian deaths are so great and popular opinion of the war becomes
*  so dim that he would take this harder edged approach, even if it means challenging Israel's
*  objective of destroying Hamas and even if it means in some way jeopardizing America's
*  relationship with Israel and its ability to influence it.
*  Yeah, I think that's right.
*  I talked to an analyst the other day.
*  He says, look, he thinks there's four to six weeks left in this policy.
*  At a certain point, this becomes just too big a burden for the United States to handle
*  if it doesn't change on the ground.
*  And really the pressure on Biden to do more to intervene will grow so large, both domestically
*  and internationally, that he will have to change course and he will have to be much
*  more aggressive in trying to pull back on the Israeli offensive.
*  That's why you hear Tony Blinken said weeks, not months in terms of how far this offensive
*  should go.
*  And in private, I've been hearing lately some Israeli officials saying, look, yes, yes,
*  weeks, not months.
*  And they're trying to get in, I think, under the wire here.
*  They also see a short window here in which they have to operate before the pressure on
*  Biden grows so tense that he has to be more aggressive in his intervention.
*  Peter, I'm curious if that four to six weeks becomes influenced by something like what
*  we're seeing Israel do over the past 24 hours, which is to say we are being more successful
*  in killing Hamas fighters and leaders than perhaps the world realizes.
*  Netanyahu coming out and saying we've killed half of Hamas's battalion commanders.
*  Is that an effort by Israel to say, no, no, no, give us more time because this is actually
*  working and does the US agree with that?
*  Does the US think it's working?
*  Yeah, I mean, this is the problem, right?
*  What is the metric for success here?
*  What does it mean to destroy Hamas?
*  It's not a numbers game.
*  You can't sit there and say, OK, we've now killed X thousand Hamas fighters or militants
*  or terrorists and therefore we're good to go.
*  But I think what you're hearing when you hear the Israelis say we've killed this many battalion
*  commanders and this many leaders is a way for them to eventually declare that they have
*  been successful and allow them perhaps at some point in those next four to six weeks
*  to say, OK, we are done with this phase of the operation.
*  Doesn't mean they're going to stop all military action, by the way.
*  But at some point, they seem to be laying the groundwork to begin phasing back and to
*  say we did accomplish what we wanted because you're never going to get every single person
*  who is a Hamas member or supporter.
*  So they need to find some way to begin to say this is working.
*  From what you're saying, it's very clear that the US would like Israel to start to wrap
*  up the most intense phase of this war.
*  But the one person who's not forcefully signaling this view from the US publicly is President
*  Biden himself.
*  And I'm curious why Biden seems reluctant to do that if it's clearly now the policy
*  of his administration.
*  Yeah, it's fascinating to watch, actually, in the same week you've heard the vice president
*  and secretary of defense and secretary of state say such strong things.
*  The president himself, first of all, hasn't given a lot of formal remarks, but where he
*  has addressed this at, say, some campaign fundraisers, he has emphasized again and again
*  how much he supports Israel.
*  And he had not repeated some of the same things that his own top administration officials
*  have said.
*  Now, why is that?
*  You know, it could be a good cop, bad cop diplomacy thing.
*  I'm still the one who's on your side.
*  But it's both strategy and, I think, you know, his own personality and his own feelings about
*  Israel.
*  He says that October 7th attack was the worst, most deadliest day for Jews in the world since
*  the Holocaust.
*  And he does not want to repeat what his father told him were the mistakes of the outside
*  world in the 1930s.
*  And so he's allowing his staff to do it.
*  He's allowing his top officials to do it.
*  They're not freelancing.
*  But that's not where he's going to be personally applying the pressure at this point.
*  And if your strategy is at some point that there is a limit to this, weeks, not months,
*  then perhaps it makes sense from their point of view to hold back the president because
*  he can still come in later and increase that pressure.
*  And they understand that there's a difference when the president himself says it than when
*  the people around him say it.
*  So in the end, Biden's decision to stay personally on the side of Israel and not embody his administration's
*  ambivalence in this moment is strategic.
*  It's keeping his powder dry so that when he does deliver that message publicly, it has
*  all the more power.
*  But you're saying at the end of the day, it's a reflection of the reality that he's personally
*  inclined to support Israel in this offensive against Hamas because of his deeply felt views
*  about Israel and what it means, what it represents.
*  I think that's exactly right.
*  Strategic and personal.
*  These two things are married in Joe Biden at the moment.
*  That could change and we'll see whether it does or not.
*  But for him right now, he does not want to be the person out there banging away on the
*  Israelis, even though he is, of course, privately very concerned about the way they're conducting
*  this operation.
*  Well, Peter, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you.
*  On Thursday, as Israel pushed civilians in southern Gaza into ever smaller pockets of
*  land, the Israeli military offered what it said was evidence that Hamas militants were
*  firing rockets from humanitarian safe zones in the area.
*  Such safe zones were created at the urging of the U.S. to protect Palestinian civilians,
*  raising the possibility that Hamas is now using them as a base of operations and that
*  Israel might treat them as a military target.
*  But as of Thursday night, the Times could not immediately verify Israel's claims and
*  Hamas did not respond to the allegations.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Thursday, a Texas judge granted a request to allow an abortion despite the state's
*  strict ban on the procedure.
*  The case involves a pregnant woman whose fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition.
*  It is believed to be among the first successful attempts in the nation to seek a court-approved
*  abortion since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year and allowed states like
*  Texas to ban abortions.
*  Although the ruling applies to a single pregnant woman, it is part of a larger legal effort
*  by abortion rights advocates to ensure that even states that ban abortion still allow
*  for medical exceptions.
