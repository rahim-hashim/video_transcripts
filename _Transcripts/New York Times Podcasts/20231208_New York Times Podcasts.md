*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Barrow. This is the Daily.
*  Over the past eight weeks, what started as unwavering public support of Israel from President
*  Biden and his cabinet has now given way to something else.
*  Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.
*  Frankly, the scale of civilian suffering and the images and videos coming from Gaza are
*  devastating.
*  Growing skepticism of Israel's approach.
*  The way Israel defends itself matters. It is capable of neutralizing the threat posed
*  by Hamas while minimizing harm to innocent men, women and children. And it has an obligation
*  to do so.
*  And at times open disapproval of its tactics.
*  I have repeatedly made clear to Israel's leaders that protecting Palestinian civilians in Gaza
*  is both a moral responsibility and a strategic imperative.
*  Today, Chief White House correspondent Peter Baker reports on the public and private ways
*  that the Biden White House is trying to influence Israel's conduct and whether it's working.
*  It's Friday, December 8.
*  Peter, good morning. I just want to explain where you are as best I can tell. You seem
*  to be at the White House in the kind of room where somebody might walk by and say something.
*  I am good morning. I'm at the White House. I'm in a broom closet we call the press room.
*  And we have pool duty today. So I'm here to follow the President around whatever he
*  ends up doing.
*  Right. So if there's some ambient noise, that's the cost of working out of the White House.
*  Yeah, I'm afraid so.
*  But we wanted to talk to you, Peter, as a White House correspondent because over the past
*  week or so, as the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has ended and this war has resumed
*  in a very fierce way, the way that the Biden administration, the way the White House talks
*  about Israel and specifically how Israel is conducting its war against Hamas has changed
*  in a very conspicuous way.
*  Well, it has. You're right. You've heard in the last few days the Vice President of the
*  Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense issuing much sharper warnings to Israel that
*  they have a responsibility to avoid civilian casualties and not just they have a responsibility,
*  but they aren't living up to that responsibility. It's a much different emphasis and it represents
*  I think the frustrations about how these realies have been conducting the war that there's
*  just too many civilian casualties. There's too much bloodshed and that these images are
*  hurting both Israel and the United States around the world. These are not people who are
*  responsible for the October 7th attack, but are paying the price for it. And that's something
*  that the United States, that the Biden administration is increasingly upset about that this is not
*  good on the ground and it's not good around the world.
*  Right. And that change in tone really stands out because it is so profoundly different
*  from the way that this President and this White House and administration talked about
*  this war at the very start in the days after the October 7th attacks inside of Israel.
*  And that's where I really want to start with you, kind of understanding the President's
*  journey from there to here. So just kind of take us back to the beginning.
*  Well, at the beginning, of course, on October 7th, President Biden was honestly in Israel's
*  corner. Good afternoon. Today, the people who are zero under attack. He came out in the
*  beginning and said, the United States stands with Israel. We will not ever fail to have
*  their back. You know, I am with Israel. And not only that, he just understood and viscerally
*  expressed the trauma and the outrage and the pain that Israelis were feeling.
*  And as some people murdered, wounded, entire families taken hostage by a mosque.
*  And he was just reciting one atrocity after another. It was not an antiseptic description
*  and what had happened. It was a very personal view on his part.
*  And Jill and I are praying for those families who have been impacted by this violence. We
*  agree with those who have lost their loved ones, lost their peace of their soul.
*  And within a few days, he jumps on the plane, jumps on Air Force One. I was actually with
*  him on that plane during that trip to fly all the way across the world to Israel.
*  I'm very happy to be back in Israel with you.
*  Why is he going that far? He's going there to give them a hug almost in a little sense.
*  He literally hugs BB Netanyahu on the carmac.
*  I want to say to the people of Israel, they're courage, they're commitment, they're bravery
*  is a stunning thing.
*  And he hugs the Israeli people and he says, I'm with you. This is Joe Biden at his empathetic
*  best. It's also Joe Biden at his most pro-Israel, which of course is a different point of
*  view than a lot of Democrats have these days.
*  Well, let's talk about that. I mean, on some level, the president being support of Israel
*  after a terror attack isn't all that surprising, given the United States's historic alliance
*  with the country. But as you're hinting at, it felt for Biden personal on a level.
*  And you could hear that in his speeches and in these literal and figurative hugs.
*  Where does that come from? Where does that come from? Well, first of all, you have to remember
*  that Joe Biden is of a different generation than most Americans and most of his fellow
*  Democrats. He is of the generation where people talked about the Holocaust at the dining
*  room table. His father talked to him about America's failure to do more, to stop the
*  Holocaust early on and how that was shameful of the world, allowed that to happen. This
*  is something that Joe Biden grew up with. Right. And when he gets to the Senate, he often
*  told the story and he tells it now almost every day.
*  I told the story before and I'll tell it again to my first meeting with an Israeli Prime
*  Minister 50 years ago as a young senator about going to Israel in 1973 just before the 1973
*  Yom Kippur War. He meets Gold in my ear and how she's the famous Prime Minister of Israel.
*  Without her looking at me, she said to me, knowing I'd hear why do you look so worried
*  Senator Biden. And I said, worried. Of course, I'm worried. When she says he's worried
*  about the Jewish people, she tells him, don't worry, Senator, we Israelis have a secret weapon.
*  We have nowhere else to go. Don't worry about us. We have nowhere else to go. And he takes
*  a lot of meaning from that. So he's been talking about this for a long time. Right. In fact,
*  he recites that story about Gold in my ear during his recent trip to Israel as if to say,
*  I come here as somebody with a lot of personal connection and rapport with this country. I'm
*  not a newcomer. Absolutely. You know, he has said and he said that on that trip, you don't
*  have to be Jewish to be a Zionist. Right. That's quite a statement to make. Obviously,
*  Joe Biden is not Jewish, but he expresses, you know, a real connection to the Israeli project.
*  And it's a way you don't hear from more modern Democrats. It's not something you hear from
*  younger members of the party. This is something born of his time. And he has not changed
*  in that way. He is a big supporter of Israel going back from the beginning. And that's
*  come to this moment. But I caution this while you feel that rage. Don't be consumed by
*  it. But in that same speech, he also issues his caution. After 9-11, we were in rage in
*  the United States. While we saw justice and got justice, we also made mistakes. He says,
*  I understand your rage. I understand your feelings. We had the same thing at 9-11, but don't
*  make the mistake that we made after 9-11. I've made wartime decisions. I know the choices
*  are never clear or easy for a leadership. There's always cost, but it requires being
*  delivered. It requires asking very hard questions. And what he's saying in effect is don't
*  go too far, right? That you will lose the world right now. You have the world sympathy.
*  If you respond with excess, if you respond too aggressively, then you will lose that. And
*  he's clearly referring to the Iraq war. He doesn't say that in the speech, but that's
*  clearly the inference. And he had, remember, he had voted for that as a senator and came
*  to regret it. Right. And it felt like he was anticipating that Israel might react in
*  a way that required such a warning. It didn't feel like a warning issue just for the sake
*  of a warning. It felt like Biden was saying, I know you're about to respond with extraordinary
*  force. Yeah. It didn't come out of the blue. Everybody understands Israel's history, the
*  history of Israel is to respond with overpowering force. It's their doctrine. Their doctrine
*  is we will, you come after us, we will come after you 10 times as hard. And the reason, of
*  course, is to establish a sense of deterrence so that people don't do it again. And Biden
*  knew this, but he also knew that that overwhelming force had a cost. And the cost would be on the
*  ground in terms of civilian lives and the cost would be internationally in terms of Israel's
*  position in the world. Right. And in fact, even at that point where Biden is issuing this
*  warning, Israel has already started a pretty major bombardment of airstrikes in Gaza.
*  Right. So I'm curious how Biden starts to marry this public support of Israel with a kind
*  of enforcement of this warning issue. How does he start to ensure that Israel is going to
*  heed his admonition not to, in a sense, overreact? But part of the effect of his hug of
*  BB Netanyahu and the Israeli government is to build up the credibility to then say, I'm
*  on your side. You know how much I'm on your side. So here's my private advice about how
*  you go about doing it. And my private advice is be careful. And in Israel, they actually
*  call it the bear hug. And by the bear hug in Hebrew, they bear hug isn't just a hug
*  of effect. It's a hug of I'm controlling you a little bit, right. And that's how they
*  see Biden. That's the strategy that he's applying here. No daylight in public, but listen to me
*  behind the scene because you know I have your back. And I'm the only guy who has your
*  back like this. And so he begins to apply pressure, right. He begins to say, you know, are
*  you really sure you want to do it this way? He doesn't do questions by the way at first.
*  He does sort of a secratic thing. Is this really the way you've done it? What have you
*  thought through about the next day? What about this? What about that? And in doing so, of
*  course, telling them how he thinks they should go forward. So this are conversations that
*  the president is having. Conversations that sounds like they're filled with secratic
*  questions. I assume with the prime minister of Israel, Bevanette Nyahu. Yes. And they're
*  talking like all the time, especially at first. I mean, I think they've talked more than
*  a dozen times in the first six, seven weeks of this crisis. And it's not just him.
*  He is sending one administration official after another to Israel to basically hold their
*  hand. I mean, it's almost like there's never a moment when there isn't a senior administration
*  official on the ground there. The secretary of state, secretary of defense, a senior general,
*  the CIA director, whatever. And the idea seems to be we are with you, but we are literally
*  going to be in the room here and we're going to be looking over your shoulder in a sense.
*  They want to be in the room, not just hearing about things afterwards.
*  Well, talk about some of the moments and some of the strategies where we can understand
*  specific attempts by the United States to shape Israel's response during this conflict.
*  The first and most important priority for the Biden team is to keep the war from expanding
*  beyond Gaza to other parts of the region. That's the thing that President Biden fears
*  the most in those early days. And in those early days, it was real uncertainty about how
*  this could blow up. There was his bala in southern Lebanon, tossing rockets across the
*  border at the Israelis. These Israelis, there's some sentiment in Israel to go ahead and
*  go after them as well. I really launched a new war against southern Lebanon and his
*  people. They have a hundred thousand some rockets aimed at them there. And the Biden
*  teams doesn't want that. They do not want to widen this war. And what Biden does is he
*  says, look, you worry about Hamas. I'll take care of his bala because I'm going to send
*  two carriers groups to the region. And they will see that if they get involved in this
*  war in a big way, they're going to have to answer to us to the United States. And that
*  basically talks this Israelis out of expanding and escalating this war beyond Gaza. The
*  success, the number one most important priority for Biden coming in. Right. That strategy
*  from the US seems to have largely been effective. It hasn't expanded into original conflict.
*  Right. Okay. Where else do we see the US pressure? Well, another place where we see it is how
*  Israel delays the beginning of the ground war, right? It doesn't go immediately over the
*  border into Gaza as much as I think there is a desire to do that. Biden says, wait a
*  second. Before you do it, think it through. What are you going to do here? What are you
*  going to do by civilians? What are you going to do? You know, the day after. And so instead
*  of just jumping right into a ground war, Israel warn civilians to get out of the way.
*  It begins telling them head to the south and that's where you'll be safe. It isn't adequate
*  as far as a lot of their critics go. It's an adequate as far as a lot of human rights groups
*  could tell you, but it's something that Biden, I think, pushes them into doing. And he
*  affects their game plan from the start. So when we think about that moment when Israel
*  is massing troops on the border and is about it very much seems to invade Gaza, but instead
*  delays it and starts issuing these massive evacuation orders of Gaza civilians from
*  the north to the south. You're saying behind the scenes, President Biden, the administration
*  is very much playing huge role in why that happens. Right. Very much. They're not dictating.
*  They understand that dictating is not a good idea. These are not going to take it well.
*  But they're just really pushing on the consequences if they don't do it this way. Now if you do
*  it, we can tell you how this goes, they say we were in Fallujah. We were in Mosul. We
*  can give you advice. They send, in fact, a general who was in Iraq to tell these rallies
*  about their American experiences doing this kind of, you know, really tough urban warfare
*  to give them a sense of what they have ahead of them and to make sure that they have thought
*  it through enough before they get started. Right. They're also, of course, pushing Israel
*  on humanitarian aid. And this is a tough moment. Israel says at first they're going to block
*  a Gaza and not allow any food, water, fuel into the enclave. And the Americans are saying,
*  no, no, that's unacceptable. That's too far. You cannot do that. And they're fighting
*  with the Israelis in effect over getting more humanitarian aid. And eventually they
*  start to get some, not nearly enough, according to the groups, but they begin to get trucks
*  through the Rafa crossing and you begin to see some led up by the Israelis on this grudgingly
*  and unhappily because they worry that any supplies helps Hamas, not necessarily the civilians,
*  but eventually the Biden team pushes them into allowing more humanitarian aid. Right.
*  But there's a limit to how far the Biden administration is able to influence things. I mean,
*  just look at the airstrikes. They're so overwhelming, so powerful. Right. Even if you don't
*  credit the exact numbers issued by the Hamas run health ministry in Gaza, clearly there
*  are thousands and thousands of civilians who have died here because of these airstrikes.
*  So how surgical are they really? I think the Americans would have preferred a more surgical
*  approach that would hit Hamas and destroy that group without hitting so many civilians.
*  But it's hard to say how you do that, right? Because Hamas is so integrated into the community
*  and distinguishing between the two obviously has been hard, but the Americans have been
*  very frustrated, I think, behind the scenes and how heavy the toll has been among the civilian
*  casualties of those airstrikes. Right. This has got to be the single biggest source of
*  American frustration. The fact that Israel's aerial bombardment, especially, has produced
*  such staggeringly high levels of civilian deaths in Gaza. At this point, the health ministry
*  in Gaza puts that number at well over 15,000, which includes combatants and civilians,
*  thousands of which Hamas says are children. Yeah, absolutely. And it's a concern for the Biden
*  team not just because of the obvious emotion of watching people who didn't have anything to do with
*  the attack of October 7th, a price for it, but also because they know that internationally,
*  it costs Israel support and domestically here as well, right? It's cost Biden's support
*  among his fellow Democrats who are watching what's happening in Gaza with great concern,
*  great upset, sometimes great outrage, and they're outraged by Biden for not doing more to rein in
*  the Israeli. So he's under a great deal of pressure from all sides. Right. I mean, another
*  friction point, a really important friction point is what happens the day after, right? When
*  Hamas is destroyed for what have you, when Israel is done with its war, at least the main part of
*  the war, what comes next? How do you govern Gaza? You can't allow Hamas to be in charge anymore,
*  but who then takes over? And there's a real difference of opinion between Washington and Jerusalem
*  about this. You know, President Biden has been pretty straightforward, even in public saying,
*  do not reoccupy Gaza. That's not a good idea. And he wants to see the Palestinian Authority, which
*  governs at least in part the West Bank take over Gaza. And some sort of revitalized version,
*  he says, and that's not where Bebe Netanyahu and most Israeli government officials are. They don't
*  trust the Palestinian Authority. They don't think much of it. And they don't like the idea of
*  anybody else being in charge. Bebe Netanyahu said in public, I don't think there's anybody other
*  than the IDF who can be in charge in Gaza when the war part of this is over. So there are real
*  loggerheads over that. Right. I mean, that is a moment where Netanyahu openly defies President
*  Biden's wishes here because he goes on TV. And I think he's now done it twice and said Israel
*  will play a major role in the security of Gaza, which too many sounds a lot like Israel will
*  control Gaza and to some. It sounds like Israel will occupy Gaza. Yeah. I mean, you know,
*  it's not clear that necessarily means occupation because you have heard Israeli say we don't want to
*  get back in the way we used to. They pulled out of course in 2005, but they planned to control it.
*  What does that mean control it? We don't know whether it might be at some kind of worse relocations.
*  That's something the Biden administration has made very clear there again. So there's a real
*  friction point there and that's going to come to a head at some point. So the question of day after
*  is another way in which Biden has realized the limitations of his influence over this conflict.
*  Right. Exactly. But that's a long term issue. In the short term, there's so many others on the
*  table, including for instance, the host is really an important priority for the president.
*  And he does manage to convince Bebe Netanyahu to pause the fighting in order to have a
*  exchange and effect with Hamas. This is an important deal that he brokers. It takes weeks. He points
*  a secret cell of negotiators working with Guter, the Gulf Emirate, which is friendly with both
*  Hamas and the United States. President himself is getting on the phone with Netanyahu and with
*  the Emir of Guter to break the last kind of obstacles to this. And they do have a deal. They do
*  pause the fighting for basically a week or so in order to release some of the hostages.
*  About 110 hostages get out mainly women and children. But there's still another hunter or so
*  in captivity, including a number of Americans. And at some point, this hostage deal breaks down.
*  Hamas refuses to put more women on the list. And to the extent that the Americans that hoped
*  this pause and fighting would give them some breathing room to allow more humanitarian and to
*  maybe shape the next phase of the combat, maybe even to see if the combat might not have to
*  resume quite at the same level. That's the test for the Biden strategy here.
*  Right. I recall understanding from coverage that you wrote Peter during this period that the
*  United States saw the ceasefire, the pause and fighting during the hostage deal as a chance
*  to reshape the war. And that was the hope. And then the resumption occurs. And my strong
*  sense is that they don't quite feel that that is what happens. No. In fact, they specifically say
*  don't go into southern Gaza where you have told everybody to go flee for their safety and then
*  start indiscriminately bombing again. And they push the Israelis to say you need to do more
*  tactical, more targeted kind of strikes. Be more surgical about what you do. And the Israelis
*  basically, they take some of this to heart. They do, you know, issue some maps saying here are some
*  safe places for civilians to go. But otherwise they basically go into the south and full force.
*  And it be the war suddenly that it paused for a number of days and giving everybody kind of a
*  chance to catch their breath is back on full bore. And suddenly we're back where we were before
*  the hostage exchange. And this is an important pivot point. That's when you begin to see
*  senior administration officials almost in like an a chorus begin in public to really
*  ratchet up the pressure on Israel. They need to stop doing things the way they were doing
*  them. You're hearing them say you heard secretary of state Tony Blinken say they can't do in the south
*  what they did in the north. We need to have a different way of approaching it. You hear
*  Lloyd Austin saying look if you go after the Palestinian civilians, all you're doing is
*  radicalizing them and creating a whole new generation of enemies. And this is a very different
*  tone than you heard from the Biden administration for the first seven eight weeks. Right. Suddenly
*  the public rhetoric from the Biden administration is starting to it seems more accurately
*  reflect the private pressure that the president has been putting on Israel. Exactly. And the assumption
*  is that's because these really aren't listening to the private messaging anymore. And so by taking it
*  public you are reinforcing your point and pushing them even harder.
*  We'll do it back.
*  The week long truce between Israel and Hamas is over. Israel says it has resumed combat operations
*  and says Hamas quote violated the operation of cars and in addition fired toward Israeli territory.
*  The new Israeli air strikes raining down on Gaza overnight after the temporary cease-fire
*  collapse. The death for climbing in Gaza. Israel pounded the south of Gaza today. The same region
*  they had told Palestinians in the north to evacuate too. The Israeli army says it's engaged in
*  the heaviest fighting since it began its ground invasion five weeks ago. About 170,000 people in
*  car units have been warned to leave for safety. But a spokesman for the UN Children's Charity
*  says there's nowhere safe for people to go.
*  So Peter the post hostage deal post cease-fire is really assault of southern Gaza. Clearly has not
*  so far seemed to conform to the wishes of the American government. And that makes me want to
*  understand if President Biden wanted to pressure Israel much further on issues like reducing civilian
*  deaths. What tools does the president and his administration have at their disposal to really do
*  that beyond socratic questions and evening phone calls with Netanyahu saying I'd like you to do
*  this a little bit differently and beyond the public statements that Biden's deputies are now making.
*  How much further could Biden go?
*  Well, I mean the administration they were the Americans have extraordinary
*  influence tools if they want to use them. First of all, of course, the United States is the
*  main supplier for Israel's military operation at this point. They need American interceptors for
*  their anti-missile batteries. They need American ammunition. They need American arms. And I think
*  that that is a huge instrument if the Biden administration wanted to use it. Now they're not
*  using it in a public way. There is some suggestion as to maybe quietly whether they're holding back
*  or delaying certain chipmins, but publicly they're not conditioning arm supplies with any kind of
*  demands about how the war be conducted. But you're hearing Democrats say that in Congress who are
*  talking about the $14 billion that President Biden has asked for for additional aid. A lot of
*  Democrats are saying, well, why don't we attach conditions to that for explicit conditions about
*  how they conduct the war. And so far the Biden administration hasn't ruled that out but hasn't
*  gone along with it either. I mean, what this makes clear is that Biden does have meaningful leverage
*  over Israel in this conflict if he wants to use it. And I think what this seems to reveal is
*  a bit of a paradox at the center of what the Biden administration is up to in this war. It says it
*  wants to support Israel in its objective of defeating Hamas. And increasingly makes clear it wants
*  to limit civilian deaths. But it's not willing to do anything to lower civilian deaths that might
*  jeopardize Israel's objective in defeating Hamas. And therefore civilian deaths are going to
*  keep growing. So basically these two stated US goals just do not seem compatible at the moment.
*  Well, they're definitely in conflict. They do not want to undermine Israel. Obviously they are
*  very straightforwardly on Israel side here. But they are very concerned that the civilian
*  casualties are excessive and that they don't want to cost Israel's standing in the world. They are the
*  one country that stands by Israel time and time again when the rest of the world is condemning
*  them. They're the ones that block security council resolutions of the United Nations that are
*  blasting Israel. They are the ones who supply them the arms. So you know, United States has such a
*  unique relationship with Israel. It is both a partner and in some ways a mentor. So it's a
*  symbionic relationship in that way. This is why Biden can in fact do what he has done to
*  influencing, but he does not want to go so far as to seem to undercut them. And it's a balancing
*  act that some people would say, you know, we'd argue about whether he's been successful at.
*  But that's the treacherous territory. I just want to make sure I understand what you're saying
*  because it feels important. Biden feels confident that a relationship in which he's at the table
*  having these calls with Netanyahu and able to apply private pressure even when it's not all that
*  effective is a better scenario than one in which he threw pressure, perhaps too much pressure in
*  the eyes of Israel, alienates it and has no influence over the way it conducts this war. That's
*  the calculation. Yes, exactly right. If you talk to administration officials what you hear them say
*  is if we didn't support them, they would do this anyway. They wouldn't be moderating in any fashion.
*  They would find other ways. They have their own weapons. They would go to other places to get
*  weapons if they had to. They would do whatever was necessary. So from Biden's point of view,
*  rightly or wrongly, it's better to be at the table and be able to have some influence than to
*  be on the outside without any. But is there a point, Peter, based on your reporting on this
*  president and your larger reporting on the history of America's relationship with Israel and the
*  world where this conflict we're talking about and the calculations that Biden is making,
*  they just might change where he might decide that the civilian deaths are so great and popular
*  opinion of the war becomes so dim that he would take this harder edge to approach even if it means
*  challenging Israel's objective of destroying Hamas and even if it means in some way jeopardizing
*  America's relationship with Israel and its ability to influence it. Yeah, I think that's the right.
*  I talked with Ann. I'll see the other day. He thinks there's four to six weeks left in this policy.
*  At a certain point, this becomes just too big a burden for the United States to handle if it
*  doesn't change on the ground. Eventually, the pressure on Biden to do more to intervene will grow
*  so large, both domestically and internationally, that he will have to change course and he will have
*  to be much more aggressive and trying to pull back on the Israeli offensive. That's why you hear
*  Tony Blinken said weeks not months in terms of how far this offensive should go. And in private,
*  I've been hearing lately. Some Israeli officials saying, look, yes, yes, weeks not months and
*  they're trying to get in, I think, under the wire here. I did. They also see a short window here
*  in which they have to operate before the pressure on Biden grows so tense that he has to be
*  more aggressive in his intervention. Peter, I'm curious if that four to six weeks
*  becomes influenced by something like what we're seeing Israel do over the past 24 hours,
*  which is to say we are being more successful in killing Hamas fighters and leaders than perhaps
*  the world realizes Netanyahu coming out and saying we've killed half of Hamas's battalion commanders.
*  Is that an effort by Israel to say no, no, no, give us more time because this is actually working
*  and does the US agree with that? Does the US think it's working? Yeah, I mean, this is a problem,
*  right? What is a metric for success here? What does it mean to destroy Hamas? It's not a numbers
*  game. You can't sit there and say, okay, we've now killed ex-thousand Hamas fighters or militants
*  or terrorists and therefore we're good to go. But I think what you're hearing when you hear
*  the Israelis say we've killed this many battalion commanders and this many leaders is a way for
*  them to eventually declare that they have been successful and allow them, perhaps at some point in
*  those next four to six weeks, to say, okay, we are done with this phase of the operation. Doesn't
*  mean they're going to stop all military action, by the way, but at some point they seem to be laying
*  in the ground or to begin phasing back and to say we did accomplish what we wanted because you're
*  never going to get every single person who is a Hamas member or supporter so they need to find
*  some way to begin to say this is working. From what you're saying, it's very clear that the US
*  would like Israel to start to wrap up the most intense phase of this war. But the one person
*  who's not forcefully signaling this view from the US publicly is President Biden himself.
*  And I'm curious why Biden seems reluctant to do that if it's clearly now the policy of his
*  administration. Yeah, it's fascinating to watch actually. In the same week you've heard the vice
*  president of Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State say so strong things. The president himself,
*  first of all, hasn't given a lot of formal remarks, but where he has addressed this at say some
*  campaign fundraisers, he has emphasized again and again how much he supports Israel and he not
*  repeated some of the same things that his own top administration officials have said. Now why is
*  that? You know, it could be a good cop, bad cop diplomacy thing. I'm still the one who's on your side.
*  But it's both strategy and I think, you know, his own personality and his own feelings about Israel.
*  He says that October 7th attack was the worst, most deadliest day for Jews in the world since the
*  Holocaust. And he does not want to repeat what his father told him with the mistakes of the outside
*  world in the 1930s. And so he's allowing his staff to do it. He's allowing his top officials to do it.
*  They're not freelancing, but that's not where he's going to be personally applying the pressure
*  at this point. And if your strategy is at some point that there is a limit to this week's not
*  months, then perhaps it makes sense from their point of view to hold back the president because he
*  can still come in later and increase that pressure. And they understand that it's a difference
*  when the president himself says it, then when the people around him say it.
*  So in the end, Biden's decision to stay personally on the side of Israel and not embody
*  his administration's ambivalence in this moment is strategic. It's keeping his powder dry so that when
*  he does deliver that message publicly, it has all the more power. But you're saying at the end of
*  the day, it's a reflection of the reality that he's personally inclined to support Israel in
*  this offensive against Hamas because of his deeply felt views about Israel and what it means,
*  what it represents. I think that's exactly right. Strategic and personal. These two things are
*  married in Joe Biden at the moment. That could change and we'll see whether it does or not.
*  But for him right now, he does not want to be the person out there banging away on the
*  Israelis, even though he is, of course, privately very concerned about the way they're conducting this operation.
*  Well, Peter, thank you very much. We appreciate it. Thank you.
*  On Thursday, as Israel pushed civilians in southern Gaza into ever smaller pockets of land,
*  the Israeli military offered what it said was evidence that Hamas militants were firing rockets
*  from humanitarian safe zones in the area. Such safe zones were created at the urging of the US
*  to protect Palestinian civilians, raising the possibility that Hamas is now using them as a base
*  of operations, and that Israel might treat them as a military target.
*  But as of Thursday night, the Times could not immediately verify Israel's claims,
*  and Hamas did not respond to the allegations.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Thursday, a Texas judge granted a request to allow an abortion despite the state's strict ban
*  on the procedure. The case involves a pregnant woman whose fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition.
*  It is believed to be among the first successful attempts in the nation to seek a court-approved abortion
*  since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year and allowed states like Texas to ban
*  abortions. Although the ruling applies to a single pregnant woman, it is part of a larger legal
*  effort by abortion rights advocates to ensure that even states that ban abortion still allow
*  for medical exceptions. Today's episode was produced by Stella Tam, Olivia Nat,
