# Trump 2.0: What a Second Trump Presidency Would Bring
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9_tITIipeU)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro.
*  This is a special episode of The Daily.
*  Starting today, we begin a series of episodes leading up to Election Day that will explore
*  what a second Trump presidency would look like and what it would mean for American democracy.
*  Part One.
*  Trump's Plan.
*  In 2016, I declared, I am your voice.
*  Today I add, I am your warrior.
*  I am your justice.
*  And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.
*  I am your retribution.
*  On the campaign trail, Trump has outlined a second term.
*  He says, you're not going to be a dictator, are you?
*  I said, no, no, no.
*  Other than day one, we're closing the border.
*  That is far more radical, vindictive and unchecked than his first one.
*  We will root out the communists, Marxists, fascists and the radical left thugs that live
*  like vermin within the confines of our country, that lie and steal and cheat on elections.
*  My colleagues, Jonathan Swan, Maggie Haberman and Charlie Savage, have found that behind
*  that rhetoric is a highly coordinated plan to make his vision a reality.
*  This is the final battle.
*  They know it.
*  I know it.
*  You know it.
*  Everybody knows that this is it.
*  It's Monday, April 29th.
*  All right, let's start.
*  Maggie, Charlie, Jonathan, thank you for rearranging your lives to be in the same room at the same
*  time from the multiple places you all live.
*  Thanks for having us.
*  Thanks for coming down to DC for it.
*  Thanks for making me come down to DC.
*  This isn't normally how we do things, three guests in the same room, but we think this
*  is a big enough and important enough conversation to merit doing it this way.
*  The reason we felt this way is because all three of you have been engaged in a months
*  long line of reporting about what a second Donald Trump presidential term would look
*  like, what Trump 2.0 would seek to achieve, how different it would be from the first term,
*  and how much more it might test the norms of our government and perhaps even the values
*  of our democracy.
*  So just to begin, why in your own minds did you undertake this project and what were your
*  biggest questions heading into it?
*  It's an obvious reporting project when you have somebody who's already served in government,
*  you have this body of accomplishments, work, intentions that he's half completed, fully
*  completed in some cases in the first term, and now he's running for office again.
*  But what made it different and why we were so intensely interested in this very early
*  is that Donald Trump's last year of his first term was very different from the first three
*  years and it was really a foreshadowing of what a second term would look like.
*  And where I sort of begin in my mental map of this is the first impeachment of Donald
*  Trump in early 2020.
*  We know from our reporting that he was sitting in the dining room adjoining the Oval Office
*  watching these proceedings on television.
*  And he's watching this assortment of people who sort of embodied in his mind the deep
*  state testify against him.
*  And he's saying, who the F is this person?
*  Who's this person?
*  Who are these snakes?
*  They're out to get me.
*  And there were people in his government.
*  And after that impeachment, when he was acquitted, this is a guy who wanted to take names and
*  get rid of them.
*  This was a guy motivated by vengeance.
*  So he brings back in his body man, former body man, Johnny McEntee, who's this young
*  guy who had no government experience.
*  And he basically says, come in.
*  I want you in charge of presidential personnel and I want you to get rid of all the snakes,
*  get rid of all the disloyal people.
*  And that sort of sets the train for this last 10, 11 months of government.
*  And one addendum to that, Michael, a lot of what they wanted to accomplish that year,
*  they couldn't because of COVID.
*  COVID changed a lot of what they were looking at doing.
*  Changed their focus.
*  Changed their focus.
*  They resumed ultimately trying to focus on purging the government of people who they
*  believe were opposed to Trump.
*  But they were thrown from where they were initially heading shortly after the impeachment
*  ended because of COVID.
*  And obviously that last year of the presidency and this new approach, all of this came to
*  a head after the election and in the lead up to January 6, where Donald Trump, desperate
*  to overturn the election, had to search outside the White House for lawyers who would tell
*  him what he wanted to hear, that Michael Pence, your vice president, can unilaterally reject
*  the results of the election.
*  And for people who would tell him that you can order your Department of Homeland Security
*  to go around the country seizing voting machines, those were the ideas that he was seeking out.
*  But he was stymied.
*  He was stymied because they hadn't accomplished what they set out to accomplish in terms of
*  ridding the government of people who would be impediments.
*  Those impediments were still there at the end.
*  And they proved very decisive, including the ultimate impediment, which was his vice president.
*  And so what we found through our reporting is that he wants to make certain that in a
*  second term, those people who were pushing back, particularly in that last period, are
*  not there.
*  And then in fact, the people who are there are people who are going to be bringing him
*  the means of achieving what he wants to achieve.
*  Well, what does he want to achieve?
*  Do all of your combined reporting efforts reveal, top line, about what Donald Trump
*  would seek in a second term?
*  Well, the first thing we all agreed on in this project was we didn't want this to be
*  some fan fiction, sitting around, you know, smoking a pipe, trying to imagine what a second
*  term of Trump would look like.
*  We want it to be rooted in real reporting.
*  And also, where the sweet spot of this series was, is we had reporting on what Trump himself
*  has been saying privately in his inner circle and the intersection of that with this very
*  well-funded and quite vast network of outside groups that are formulating policy.
*  And so we focused very intently on things that Donald Trump himself cares about.
*  And at the heart of that is power, centralizing power, clearing away guardrails.
*  And that is why Charlie became such an essential partner for Maggie and I, because, you know,
*  Maggie and I have the background with Trump.
*  We have the sourcing in his world and the conservative movement, the outside groups.
*  But what we don't have is what Charlie has, which is expertise in executive power and
*  understanding the legal aspects of all of this.
*  Well, thank you for that, Jonathan.
*  I could listen to you all day.
*  No, I think the top line of all of this is Trump is someone who is interested in his
*  own personal power in removing any interior barriers, guardrails, or constraints on that
*  power.
*  He's far more interested in power as an into itself than in the details of policy.
*  And yet he's surrounded by people who have their own policy agendas that align with him
*  and are telling him, we will increase your power so that you can do these things.
*  And therefore it is a pulling together towards a presidency that would be unlike anything
*  we have seen before.
*  So I just want to be very clear about this, because it's so central to the work you're
*  all doing to understand what another Trump presidency might be like.
*  He, you have found, wants more power for its own sake, mostly.
*  And at the same time, there are people around him who hope to achieve certain policy goals.
*  And they've identified that the best way to do that is for Trump to accumulate the power
*  that he wants.
*  So together, they've collectively determined that the way to accomplish all of this is
*  to remove the encumbrances and the obstacles that stood in Trump's way the first time and
*  make sure that they are not present in a second term.
*  So let's talk about the details of how Trump and those around him might achieve all of
*  this logistically.
*  Where do you all think we should start?
*  What he's going to look for is people who are much more ideologically aligned with him.
*  And he's focused on a cabinet full of people who are going to find ways to enact the policies
*  that he wants.
*  So what would characterize the people he would be choosing in a Term 2 cabinet?
*  It is going to be people who he thinks are going to enact whatever his agenda in that
*  moment is, who won't stymie him on foreign policy, who won't go out and oppose him on
*  his views on NATO, for instance.
*  Trump wants people who are going to help him get to a yes, not a no.
*  And to put a finer point on it, his biggest regret from his first term is personnel.
*  It's the people he hired.
*  You ask him what his biggest regret is, he'll just list names.
*  Jeff Sessions, the first attorney general, Bill Barr, the second attorney general, John
*  Bolton, all the generals that he appointed, Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
*  Basically, the list of people that you see going out and saying that he's unfit to serve,
*  that's the group of people that really surrounded him for the first two, three years of the
*  administration.
*  Got it.
*  And many of them saw their job as protecting the country and the world from Donald Trump.
*  In that last year, Trump cleared out several of these people that he regarded as disloyal
*  or obstructionist and started to appoint people that he viewed as loyal, as people who were
*  willing to implement his agenda.
*  But in his mind, he hadn't gone nearly far enough.
*  Right.
*  So let's assume Trump is able to get the cabinet that he wants and make the appointments that
*  he wants.
*  What would Trump likely turn to next?
*  Well, I think an important insight that flows out of what Maggie and Jonathan were just
*  saying is about a layer of power and potential constraint or permission that exists less
*  in the public eye, one layer below the cabinet official, which is the top lawyers at various
*  departments and agencies.
*  The lawyers occupied a unique niche in the government because they're about what is permissible.
*  And if they say no, it's a real problem.
*  And one of the things we wrote about early in our series was about how in the first term,
*  one of the constraints was that lawyers, politically appointed lawyers, conservative Republican,
*  Federalist Society lawyers that filled the ranks of the legal structure of government
*  in the first term had often acted to constrain Trump, had raised legal objections about things
*  that he and the people around him in the White House wanted to do.
*  They don't want any of those conversations to happen in the next term.
*  They want lawyers who will say yes.
*  And so they have been systematically vetting lawyers for a potential second term already.
*  Yes.
*  And they are eschewing the traditional that Jonathan was the first, I think, reporter to
*  wake up to this, a break between the MAGA movement and Federalist Society, conservative
*  legal movement, where the MAGA movement sees them now as too willing to say no, too willing
*  to raise rule of law questions and wants a different kind of lawyer.
*  Yeah, I just kind of want to underscore how kind of stunning this is.
*  In many readers minds, particularly like liberal readers, the Federalist Society is this sort
*  of dark Darth Vader type entity run by Leonard Leo, big bad Leonard Leo.
*  In Trump world now, it's sort of a lot of these, these are a bunch of squishes, just
*  so you understand.
*  Squishes are those who are insufficiently backbone.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  The Federalist Society was, you know, the heart, the beating heart.
*  I mean, Leonard Leo built the pipeline that delivered Trump's Supreme Court, the Supreme
*  Court that overturned Roe.
*  But Donald Trump has had a falling out with Leonard Leo and his people like Stephen Miller,
*  who runs this America First legal group, which is doing some of this vetting of lawyers.
*  He's not going through the traditional Federalist Society pipeline.
*  And so it's a very different mindset.
*  You won't hear any of these people say we need to break the law.
*  And that's not what they're saying.
*  But stretch, push the envelope, find creative ways to get what needs to be done done.
*  Hmm.
*  It strikes me that so far everything we've been discussing is about clearing away guard
*  rails at the higher levels of government, the cabinet, lawyers for the White House,
*  lawyers for various federal agencies.
*  But Jonathan, you mentioned earlier that Trump is also really interested in getting rid of
*  the people he described as the snakes, right?
*  The kind of lower level government workers he thinks of as being the heart of the deep
*  state who testified against him during his first impeachment.
*  So help us understand who exactly these snakes are and what the plans are for getting them
*  out of Trump's way.
*  So just to kind of zoom back a little bit, the federal government, the way I think about
*  it is basically there's this rotating layer on top of about 4,000 political appointees
*  that get replaced every time a new president comes in.
*  Below that is this mass of two million plus career officials who have pretty good protections.
*  There are all of these procedures you have to go through in order to fire someone.
*  They have lots of rights as an employee of the federal government to object, to appeal.
*  And that's by design.
*  The design is a nonpartisan, professionalized workforce that does not change every time
*  there's a new party in power, but actually develops expertise over a number of years.
*  And these are the people who come up with rules to regulate stuff that's not sexy, but
*  clean drinking water, food, all of this stuff.
*  So anyway, what's Trump's plan?
*  Trump, his idea wasn't Trump's idea.
*  It was a guy named James Shook, but was how do we fire more people?
*  How do we get our own people in?
*  And he came up with this idea shorthanded as Schedule F, but it's an executive order
*  that Trump issued in October of 2020.
*  In the first term?
*  Yes.
*  It didn't get much attention at the time because it was October.
*  It was the very end and they didn't really have time to properly implement it.
*  But it would allow them to reassign.
*  They estimated 50,000 people who they determined were involved in some way in affecting policy.
*  And what this order would allow to do is effectively turn them into political appointees.
*  So you are now Schedule F.
*  And so it would allow them to fire as many as 50,000 and replace them with their own people.
*  Now, I want to caveat this a little bit, which is that in the view of some of Trump's
*  closest advisors who really are steeped in this, they don't believe that they will need to
*  fire necessarily that many people and replace them.
*  They believe that the threat of the order will have a chilling effect and will force these
*  people into line and will make them stop trying to slow walk or obstruct.
*  If you know that your head can be chopped off, you might salute a little quicker.
*  Is that legal, Charlie?
*  Is this possible with Jonathan's description?
*  So it hasn't been tested.
*  Biden immediately rescinded it when he came in.
*  And so we don't know if we don't know, but it'll be the Trumpified Supreme Court that
*  ultimately decides whether or not a president can do this.
*  Right. This Supreme Court, at least the six conservatives on it, are part of a
*  conservative legal movement that predates Trump that has been interested for a
*  generation or more in centralizing greater executive power over the government in the
*  White House itself.
*  And a huge component of that is increasing the president's power to remove people that
*  do not do exactly what he wants them to do.
*  So I think that this would be a good opportunity for them to put another brick on
*  that wall. So I think they would probably uphold it.
*  If Trump is successful in carrying out this kind of remaking of government personnel at
*  all the levels we've been talking about here, what kind of policy changes that either
*  he or those around him want would logically flow from that?
*  So one of our major early focuses on what the policy consequences could be was in the
*  area of immigration, obviously a core part of Trumpism.
*  And while they did succeed in 2020 with the help of Covid in shutting down the border
*  temporarily, they were unable to really achieve their broader agenda in immigration
*  enforcement. And so they have laid out and developed a roadmap for a really radical
*  crackdown on immigration at a scale that we have not seen in the modern era to escalate
*  the number of deportations from several hundred thousand a year to millions per year
*  to militarize the border, to use military funds to build gigantic camps along the
*  border, to hold all these people.
*  Basically detention camps, detention camps, to try again to end birthright citizenship
*  for people born in the United States to undocumented parents, to extend due process
*  free removals of people who have been here less than two years and to essentially put
*  the entire weight of the federal government around the single minded task of purging the
*  country of people who do not have a legal right to be here.
*  I mean, that sounds like basically the first terms already very aggressive approach to
*  immigration, basically on steroids.
*  And I wonder how the personnel changes we're talking about might make that possible to
*  accomplish.
*  So there were certain attempts to push through policies in the first term that raised legal
*  concerns. The general counsel of the Department of Homeland Security, John Mitnick, who is
*  a very conservative, traditional federal society style Republican lawyer, occasionally
*  would say to the White House, to Stephen Miller, Trump's top immigration adviser, there's
*  a legal problem with that.
*  And not having someone there who would say there's a legal problem with that would be
*  a tremendous effort in terms of we're just doing it and we'll let it be fought out in
*  the courts. A judiciary that is much more Trump oriented now than it was for much of
*  the term that Trump had before due to his own appointments to the Supreme Court.
*  We think that we'll get it through.
*  And so just in the area of immigration and what it would mean domestically to have this
*  kind of sort of police state crackdown necessary to achieve the goals they have is one
*  area in which they have very openly, quite radical plans that they could very well
*  achieve.
*  Am I right to imagine that combined with what you just said, Charlie, would be the
*  implementation perhaps of that change to the civil service rules that would have sent the
*  message, Jonathan, like you said, to lower ranking people, perhaps in Homeland Security
*  and immigration world, that maybe you just saw something get implemented that you don't
*  think is good or legal, you're going to be a lot less likely to complain about it, become
*  a whistleblower, whatever, if you are suddenly worried that your own job status, which had
*  previously been pretty safe, might now be on the line.
*  Yeah, I mean, that's explicitly the view.
*  It stands to reason that if you need your income to feed your family and to pay your
*  mortgage and you could lose your job, the threat of that would have an educational impact
*  on the way that you do your job.
*  Yeah, politely said.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Okay.
*  How else, based on your all reporting, does Trump's orbit intend to knock down barriers
*  in his way and ensure that there are those throughout government inclined to do his
*  bidding?
*  We had some really interesting conversations with sources in Trump's orbit early on in
*  this reporting.
*  And one of the concepts that emerged was this idea of scouring the federal government for
*  any pocket of independence, any element within the executive branch that operated with any
*  independence from the president.
*  The idea being we need to eradicate that because we believe that executive power exists in
*  the human body of the president, which is the sort of logical end point of something
*  called the unitary executive theory.
*  In shorthand, this is an idea that began in the Reagan administration that was an interpretation
*  of the constitution whereby executive power is vested in the president of the United
*  States and that it is illegal for there to be any impediments to that power within the
*  executive branch.
*  Where this matters is that the way the government actually works and has worked for the past
*  century, there is not total unfettered control of the entire government vested in the president
*  as a singular person.
*  Congress has created by law various pockets of some independent decision making authority.
*  They have said that the head of the EPA is the person who decides how much air pollution
*  to let in the air, not the president in the Oval Office stroking his chin and saying,
*  oh, this much mercury is too much.
*  He doesn't know what to do.
*  Congress says we're going to have an expert do that, or at least the person leading this
*  expert agency.
*  And in some places, Congress has gone beyond that and created agencies that it's empowered
*  to do things, whether it's the Federal Reserve setting interest rates, Federal Trade Commission,
*  Federal Communications Commission, and regulating Internet and phone companies where they are
*  allowed to issue regulations.
*  But it's run by a commission that although the president appoints these people, he cannot
*  remove them at will if they act differently than he wants them to do.
*  But these are literally called independent agencies.
*  They fall under the executive branch, but they still retain...
*  They're exercising executive power.
*  The Supreme Court has said it is OK for Congress as part of its constitutional authorities
*  to structure the government in this way so that the president does not just sort of the
*  dictator of all that happens.
*  And how does Trump want to treat these agencies?
*  Trump says on his website, we are going to bring the so-called independent agencies under
*  executive authority, under the president's authority.
*  And that would mean trying to fire someone who has these job protections, a member of
*  an independent agencies commission, who does something Trump doesn't like, and seeing if
*  this new look Supreme Court that Trump has created will uphold what they're trying to
*  do.
*  And if they can get five votes on the Supreme Court, that's the end of executive independence.
*  That's the end of independent agencies.
*  That means that going forward, the president, in this case, Donald Trump for a while, would
*  exercise total control over these chunks of the government that for generations have
*  some degree of checks and balances on what the president can order by dictat.
*  What's an example of an agency, independent agency, that frustrated Trump in the first
*  term and how that agency might be changed if he got this level of power?
*  So a really good example of that is the Fed.
*  Trump wanted them to lower interest rates, was constantly using public commentary to
*  try to influence what might happen.
*  They have not gone so far as to say what they would try to do about the Fed if Trump comes
*  back into office.
*  But that would be a great example of a so-called independent agency where Trump wanted to see
*  something different.
*  This is just a good example, Maggie brought up, of how to think about it.
*  Because if you are in office and you're running for reelection, you want the economy to be
*  roaring.
*  And a good way to make the economy do better is to lower interest rates.
*  Unless inflation is really high.
*  So it may not be in the long term health interests of the economy to lower interest rates, just
*  because there's going to be an election in four months.
*  But it may be in the short term interests of whoever happens to be in the Oval Office.
*  And so we have Congress set up a structure in which the Federal Reserve is supposed to
*  analyze the economy with an eye towards the long term economic health of the country and
*  not the short term political interests of whoever happens to be in power.
*  That's why there's independence there.
*  But if it's unconstitutional to have any executive power that's independent of the president's
*  control, then that would, by definition, be something that the president could direct
*  out of his or her own self-interest, even if it wrecks the country in the long term.
*  Right. It feels like the repercussions of this would be pretty far reaching.
*  I'm thinking about how much Donald Trump has always not just wanted to raise or lower
*  interest rates, but take away the licenses of TV networks that he disagrees with.
*  And that would fall, and correct me if I'm wrong, Charlie, under the independent agency
*  known as the Federal Communications Commission.
*  That's right. Not necessarily that he disagrees with, but that publish error journalism that
*  criticizes him. I mean, do you think, Jonathan, that if President Trump were to achieve this
*  power and the courts would approve it, that you could start seeing things like that happen?
*  Rather than speculate, I just go back to what he's telling us he's going to do.
*  And multiple times he has said that Comcast, you know, owner of NBC, he has very strongly
*  signaled that there will be repercussions if he gets back in and has again has said this
*  out loud in public.
*  He hasn't been specific about what exactly those repercussions will be.
*  But, you know, I don't think it's a huge leap of imagination to think that Donald Trump
*  might want to use the regulatory powers available to him as president to punish entities that
*  he's already promised to punish.
*  So what we're already talking about is a very meaningful re-envisioning and restructuring
*  of presidential power.
*  That's correct, Michael. But there's one agency that looms larger in Trump's mind than any
*  other in the government, and that's the Department of Justice.
*  And it is an agency with which Donald Trump has a historically very fraught relationship.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So what is Trump's vision for the Department of Justice in a second term?
*  And how does it fit in with everything else that we have been talking about here?
*  I think the way to explain this in the simplest terms is that Donald Trump has never viewed
*  the Department of Justice in the way that it has been viewed since the Watergate era.
*  Firstly, it isn't an independent agency.
*  It's an agency within the executive branch that has some degree of independence by norm.
*  By norm.
*  Not by law.
*  The idea being that a president should not direct, for example, investigations or
*  prosecutions of people.
*  Those decisions should be made independently.
*  Trump doesn't view it that way.
*  Firstly, he wants the Justice Department for there to be no independence.
*  And he's already said out loud that if he gets in again, he will appoint, quote, unquote,
*  a real special prosecutor to go after, that's a direct quote, go after President Biden
*  and his family.
*  So he's not making any secret about this.
*  He's telling us what he's going to do.
*  And he's got allies on the outside who are working on frameworks to justify getting
*  rid of the independence of the DOJ.
*  Well, what mechanisms exist for a potential President Trump and his allies to achieve
*  what Jonathan's talking about, Charlie, to essentially begin to wipe away the independence
*  that was, as you said, by norm, by tradition rather than by law within the DOJ?
*  Is it just going to be him showing up and appointing the right attorney general or do
*  they have to justify it in other legal ways?
*  So let me start to answer that by picking up on your word, begin, because I think it's
*  important to note that this would not be something unique about a second Trump term,
*  but an intensification of what we saw in the first term.
*  So Trump did, in fact, pressure the Justice Department when he was in office to use the
*  powers of federal criminal law enforcement to go after his enemies.
*  He pressured and succeeded in getting the Justice Department to open investigations into
*  people like Jim Comey, right?
*  Like Hillary Clinton, his Democrats or members of the previous administration's national
*  security state that he wanted to scapegoat for the fact that his campaign ties to Russia
*  came under suspicion and they failed to find evidence sufficient to bring charges and that
*  enraged him.
*  And so part of what the vision is here is even if you independent prosecutor, you know,
*  don't want to go ask the grand jury to indict so and so because you don't think you have a
*  good case. If I, the president, tell you to do it, you will go do that anyway.
*  You're removed, right?
*  This is the sort of direct control.
*  I will appoint a real prosecutor who will do the thing that even the people who are quite
*  loyal to me like Bill Barr were unwilling to do or unable to do the last time.
*  And that's the sort of direct use of federal law enforcement power for political purposes
*  that a Justice Department that is no longer seen even as a norm independent from direct
*  White House control would be capable of.
*  So a successful version of this for Trump would not just be the opening of investigations
*  into his enemies, which he already did, as you just said, Charlie, in the first term, but the
*  ability to force charges to be brought against people whether or not sufficient evidence
*  exists.
*  I mean, what else could it mean?
*  I want to pivot Maggie to the question of how a president Trump in the second term would
*  handle one of the biggest issues facing him right now in the campaign, which is the charges
*  against him. It has been implied that he would like a Department of Justice to stop pursuing
*  those charges.
*  So Trump advisors have said to me privately, very bluntly, that he has to win and that if
*  he wins, the soul goes away.
*  And how's that going to work?
*  Well, it would either be that he would tell his AG or his AG would do it on their own to
*  drop the cases.
*  You know, it depends on what stage those are at and whether a judge would agree.
*  Then there's the theory of whether he would try to pardon himself.
*  And he has privately said to people that the cases will go away.
*  So I don't think this is a stretch of the imagination.
*  This is how he's looking at it.
*  But it does give him an impetus for trying to win an election.
*  I mean, Charlie, is it as easy as it looks from a distance for the president to ask what
*  we imagine to be a loyal attorney general and those loyal deputies?
*  Is it easy to imagine him achieving this very quickly?
*  Yes, with the nuance that there's different kinds of cases here.
*  There's federal and state.
*  So absolutely, the federal cases against him would stop the minute he becomes president.
*  It wouldn't even necessarily take some radical new act by a radical new attorney general.
*  The longstanding Justice Department interpretation of the Constitution going back to Nixon,
*  going back to Clinton, is that sitting presidents are temporarily immune from legal
*  process because it would interfere with their constitutional responsibilities.
*  So those cases stop while he's in office.
*  When we put all these plans that we've been talking about here together and when we put
*  together all your reporting, I think it's safe to say that we're looking at a greater
*  pursuit of presidential power and intolerance for dissent within the executive branch.
*  Then we've seen in quite some time and so much of the conversation around Trump and
*  the idea of a second term is whether it would undermine our democratic system or our values.
*  And I want to just hit on that directly.
*  Is something like the consolidation of power we're talking about here using, for example,
*  the unitary executive theory.
*  Is that just a realization of a longstanding conservative principle that the president
*  should be more powerful or is it a kind of assault on our existing understanding of our
*  democratic norms?
*  How should we be thinking about that?
*  I think this is a crucial point for putting this all into perspective that this is not just
*  about Trump in the current moment.
*  You know, I'm my entire career has been about writing about executive power.
*  I wrote a book about the Bush Cheney administration's efforts to expand executive power,
*  the subtitle of which, which I hate because the book publisher posted on me, but was the
*  return of the imperial presidency in the subversion of American democracy.
*  And so you know something about this.
*  Right. So the Republican conservative movement has been trying to expand executive power
*  ever since Nixon collapsed in the Watergate in Vietnam era.
*  And then Reagan was trying to restore things in the face of a democratic Congress in the 80s.
*  And these ideas like the unitary executive theory start to arise, trying to get back to where
*  Nixon was before he fell to achieve conservative policy outcomes, even if liberals controlled
*  Congress or in that era of the courts.
*  And so this unilateralism has a deep pedigree.
*  Building blocks have been put in place long before Trump's arrives on the scene that he is
*  now able to take advantage of and take to the next level.
*  But he's building on a series of presidents that have taken things to the next level from their
*  predecessors. It's too much to say it's the end of democracy per se.
*  It's American style democracy.
*  American style democracy is not just you vote for someone and then that person can do whatever
*  they want. It's a series of checks and balances.
*  It's the prevention of too much accumulated, concentrated, unfettered power in any one person
*  is separation of powers.
*  We are suspicious of concentrated power.
*  Right. So we have set up a system in which power is diffused.
*  And yes, you need a strong presidency, but within limits, limits that are not just about the rule of
*  law, but about some degree of decision making checks so that one person cannot just
*  arbitrarily and capriciously careen the country in this direction or that direction.
*  But it has to operate within a system.
*  And what the conservative legal movement has set Trump up to do and what he now wants to do are
*  the people around him are saying, sir, we can help you do is to move into a more volatile
*  situation where whoever happens to be president at any given time can take us in a radical
*  direction very quickly.
*  We're out of NATO because I decided we're out of NATO.
*  These precedents that have been assembled over the past generation or two have set Trump up to
*  take things to the next level in a way that American style democracy, as we have come to know
*  it, would evolve into something much more volatile.
*  Well, American style democracy is the style of democracy that we're accustomed to, Jonathan.
*  So I just ask you the same question.
*  Does this fully realized or even mostly realized vision of a second term make American style
*  democracy less real and therefore is the country less democratic?
*  Is this more authoritarian?
*  When you listen to Donald Trump talk about the kinds of leaders that he admires, he doesn't
*  mention the Chancellor of Germany or the President of France.
*  He mentions Viktor Orbán in Hungary.
*  He mentions how he wishes his people would stand to attention the way they do to Kim Jong-un.
*  He talks about Xi Jinping and how he can, with the click of a finger, execute drug dealers.
*  And he talks about how they can get things moving quicker.
*  So his own views are that the president should be able to move really quickly unilaterally and
*  get things done.
*  And so the answer is yes, of course.
*  But I don't think Donald Trump ever was attached to or believed in the principles that
*  Charlie outlined.
*  There's no history in his life of caring about checks and balances and separation of power.
*  I've never heard him once talk about how these are important elements of the American system.
*  The part that throws me a little bit, because here you are invoking this idea that he is
*  drawn to authoritarian figures and clearly we've established a desire for a more empowered
*  presidency, is that everything we've talked about so far, and please correct me if I'm wrong,
*  appears that it was kind of always there for the taking.
*  If a president wanted it, they could imagine that civil servants were fireable.
*  They could attempt to bring independent agencies closer to them.
*  They could definitely appoint as loyal, as imaginable a cabinet.
*  And so all of those changes would seem to operate within the democracy.
*  And yet they might still, in a sense, curtail what we see as the American style democracy.
*  Which is when Trump was elected, a Democratic strategist said to me that the nation was about
*  to find out how much of our system is norms and not laws, which is your point that this is an
*  honor system. This has always been an honor system.
*  There are people, to Charlie's point, who have tried to increasingly press their advantage in
*  terms of executive power, but who have never taken the kind of leaps that Trump took and wants
*  to take if he comes back into office.
*  But it is to Jonathan's point, it's not that Trump has some systemic belief in democracy.
*  It's not that Trump has a particular interest in how the federal government works or doesn't
*  work. He has an interest in what can Donald Trump do?
*  And that's it. And so he has been given a bunch of rationales by lawyers or policy advisors who
*  are close to him about how far he can take things.
*  And if he is elected, he has promised that he will do that.
*  I mean, there are two other branches of government that could exert themselves in relationship to
*  everything we're talking about here.
*  One, we've already established a Supreme Court and the judiciary are now heavily populated by
*  Trump appointees. And I know many imagine that they will be more pliant than perhaps a
*  different court. So I guess I really would like to focus on the idea of Congress and the
*  legislative branch. If we get this version of a Trump administration, kind of Trump 2.0,
*  how do we imagine Congress, obviously, this is determined by which party controls it, could
*  hold some of this in check?
*  Seems like it would be a very natural instinct for a Democratic Congress.
*  Subpoenas could start flying.
*  Members of this new administration would be dragged before to explain why are you firing civil
*  servants? Why are you treating independent agencies this way?
*  Why are you doing this at the Department of Justice?
*  That would operate as a check.
*  Correct?
*  Yeah, not necessarily.
*  Because I think one thing that's really important to bear in mind is Joe Biden's been
*  president for the last three years.
*  And for the first period of his presidency, Democrats controlled the House and the Senate.
*  Now, they didn't have a supermajority, so they couldn't get everything that they wanted done.
*  But they saw the experience of Trump.
*  You know, Trump could presumably come back into power.
*  Could we pass legislation to constrain him?
*  No such legislation was passed.
*  And under Trump, OK, yes, if there's a Democratic House, that's going to stop some things and
*  there'll be much more oversight and scrutiny.
*  But the composition of the Republican Party in Congress is different than it was in 2017.
*  Trump, when he left office, made it his mission to drive out of the party disloyal people.
*  So the composition has changed substantially.
*  You're not going to see as much pushback.
*  Not that there was a huge amount in his first term, but you're going to see even less.
*  Well, you're saying basically the purge he wants to see in the executive branch has already
*  happened in the legislative branch in Congress, partly through who he endorsed or tried to
*  push out. And so that as a barrier has been.
*  Yes.
*  I mean, that was a really important part of our reporting is that that erosion of restraint
*  on the Hill has been a really important factor that creates these conditions.
*  And so the only way you'd get serious checking and balancing from a legislative branch is
*  if Democrats controlled one or both chambers, which is not a certainty.
*  Even that is too optimistic, I think, in that in the second half of Trump's term, Democrats
*  had the House and they tried to perform oversight and issued subpoenas and he didn't comply
*  with any of them. He just stonewalled them.
*  And then now what happens?
*  Well, there's a long drawn out court battle before a judiciary that was unwilling to move
*  fast enough to do anything about it.
*  And so there was stymied oversight.
*  And then another factor that both Mitt Romney and Liz Cheney have talked about is during
*  the second impeachment, they each independently claimed there were a number of their Republican
*  colleagues on the Hill who wanted to vote to convict Trump, who were afraid to do so
*  not because of their political career so much as their own physical safety in that of their
*  family. That the specter of mob violence that Trump is able to summon as made manifest on
*  January 6 is also a disciplining force within the Trumpified Republican Party.
*  Mm hmm. I think we can't end this conversation without trying to understand how central what
*  we're talking about in this room is to Trump's political appeal right now.
*  I know he doesn't go out and give a speech where he talks necessarily, you know, applause
*  lines about civil servants.
*  But there is a vision of government that we're talking about here that I imagine does translate
*  to his supporters. And how big an element is this of his appeal?
*  I think when you look at polling and you look at the way that people talk in focus groups
*  and also the way that the Trump advisors view things and I think the way he views things,
*  it's not really so much his vision for government.
*  It's strong versus weak.
*  Everything he does, his visual messaging, his rhetorical messaging is about projecting
*  strength. And I think to that extent, there's tremendous appeal in the idea of a
*  strong man. It's not just like Democrats have bad policies.
*  It's they're trying to destroy the country and they need to be defeated.
*  You hear this sort of trope from old line establishment Republicans.
*  I like Trump's policy, but I don't like his personality.
*  There's this new kind of theory on the new right, which is like, no, Trump's personality
*  is actually essential. He's the guy we need for this battle we're in.
*  And actually, we shouldn't be trying to limit the federal government and reduce its size
*  because what suckers we are if we do that.
*  No, we need to seize power and use the instruments of power to defeat our adversaries.
*  It actually fits quite neatly with what we've been talking about today, because what is
*  strong, but, you know, blowing through any obstacle or barrier or impediment to you doing
*  what you want to do. Yeah.
*  Or person. That is the embodiment of strength.
*  Well, to all three of you, Maggie, Charlie, Jonathan, thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Michael. Thanks, Matt.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Over the weekend, more than 200 protesters were arrested at college campuses across the
*  country as administrators and police sought to rein in pro-Palestinian demonstrations
*  and encampments.
*  The arrests occurred at Northeastern University, Arizona State University, Indiana
*  University and Washington University in St. Louis.
*  In each case, officials said that the protesters had violated campus rules, defied orders
*  to disperse or become dangerously anti-Semitic.
*  Overall, police have arrested more than 800 protesters on college campuses since April
*  18th, when Columbia University asked police to remove a pro-Palestinian encampment at
*  the center of campus.
*  Student protesters have since rebuilt that encampment and Columbia has said it will not
*  ask police to clear it.
