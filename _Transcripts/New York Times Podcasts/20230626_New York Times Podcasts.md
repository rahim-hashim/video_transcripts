# A 36-Hour Rebellion in Russia
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDvV6ILq9Us)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverdisi, and this is The Daily.
*  An armed rebellion in Russia over the weekend stunned the world and amounted to the single
*  biggest challenge to Vladimir Putin's rule since he came to power 23 years ago.
*  Today, my colleague Anton Trinovsky, on The Man Who Led the Revolt, and what his brief
*  but bold rebellion tells us about the future of political power in Russia.
*  It's Monday, June 26th.
*  So Anton, I think it's safe to say that we witnessed something extraordinary in Russia
*  over the weekend.
*  And the first thing I wanted to do was to call you and ask you what was going on, what
*  it was that we were witnessing.
*  I mean, what has transpired in Russia over the last 72 hours really is an incredibly
*  extraordinary event that all of us will be interpreting, deciphering for weeks, months,
*  maybe years to come.
*  It was an armed rebellion, from all we can tell.
*  It was a leader of a mercenary force, his name is Yevgeny Prigozhin, marching columns
*  of thousands of fighters armed with tanks, with artillery, with anti-aircraft batteries
*  into Russia.
*  And it raised the specter of Russians fighting Russians of civil war.
*  It was really just breathtaking.
*  I mean, the whole weekend, all Russian nerds I know, including my own husband, were just
*  texting with Russian friends, just kind of gobsmacked at how this could actually be happening.
*  But let's take this just bit by bit.
*  Why don't you first tell us, Anton, who is this guy, Yevgeny Prigozhin, and remind us
*  where he started, how he got to be where he was.
*  He is a very murky figure with a criminal past.
*  He was born in the Soviet Union in 1961 in the city that was then known as Leningrad,
*  now called St. Petersburg.
*  He spent 10 years in a Soviet prison for robbery and other crimes.
*  He then got out and in the 1990s became a businessman.
*  He opened a hot dog stand, eventually other restaurants, convenience stores.
*  Around the year 2000, so that was Putin's first year as president, that is when he says
*  he first met Vladimir Putin.
*  His story goes that he catered a meal for Putin and the Japanese prime minister.
*  He somehow won Putin's trust and became a kind of unofficial problem solver for Putin,
*  a sort of fixer operating in the shadows whose loyalty was to Putin above all.
*  He became very rich.
*  He got enormous government contracts in catering, in construction, and he really was one of
*  these classic figures of the Putin era who really owed their success to their connections
*  to Putin.
*  And remind us, how exactly is Prigozhin serving Putin?
*  Well probably the most important way in which Prigozhin kind of quietly serves Putin out
*  of the public eye is by forming this mercenary fighting group called Wagner, essentially
*  a private army that's not part of the Russian military.
*  And why Anton would Putin need that?
*  I mean, you know, he controls this massive Russian army, right?
*  Like why a private one?
*  So remember Putin as a former KGB agent seems very comfortable operating outside the public
*  eye.
*  And Prigozhin's private army gave the Russian government and the Kremlin the ability to
*  have operations carried out on its behalf from which Putin and Russian officials could
*  remain at arm's length.
*  So an early example of that was 2014, after Russia annexed Crimea and fomented a separatist
*  war in eastern Ukraine.
*  We saw Wagner troops join the fight on the Russian side there.
*  We saw it again later on after Russia intervened in the Syrian civil war in 2015.
*  Wagner forces provided those Russian boots on the ground.
*  And we saw it in Africa in recent years, places like the Central African Republic, where Wagner
*  forces have been providing security for various governments while also helping the Kremlin
*  expand its influence across the continent.
*  So kind of secret militia forces engaging really in major global conflicts.
*  Absolutely.
*  Up until the war in Ukraine, Prigozhin operated almost completely in the shadows.
*  In fact, he didn't even acknowledge that he was the guy behind the Wagner group.
*  Prigozhin almost never appeared in public, never gave interviews.
*  We saw very, very little of him.
*  Then Putin invades Ukraine in February of 2022.
*  It goes very badly.
*  Putin expected Ukraine to fall within days or weeks.
*  Instead, Ukraine put up this tremendous resistance that the Russian regular military was simply
*  not able to handle.
*  That was when Wagner got involved.
*  And not only did Prigozhin send his highly trained and experienced mercenary forces into
*  Ukraine, he also starts this incredible recruitment drive in Russian prisons that must have clearly
*  been blessed by Putin himself.
*  There's this video that gets leaked on to the Telegram messaging app last fall where
*  we see Prigozhin standing in a prison courtyard in Russia surrounded by a circle of prisoners.
*  And you can hear him laying out the terms of his recruitment, which is basically, you
*  come fight for us for six months.
*  If you try to do something bad, we shoot you.
*  If you survive, you have your freedom.
*  Which was kind of remarkable at the time, I remember, Anton, because this was kind of
*  the first time we'd ever really seen the guy in action in his mercenary role, right?
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  And this became the beginning of Prigozhin going from this man who operated purely in
*  the shadows to increasingly a public figure.
*  And how important is this Wagner fighting force to the overall Russian war effort?
*  Well, very important.
*  Numerically, they're smaller, but we're still talking about tens of thousands of fighters.
*  Certainly with those prisoners who were recruited, the Wagner group is more agile, more flexible,
*  maybe even in some ways more skilled than the Russian military.
*  They were critical, for instance, in the battle for Bakhmut, that city in eastern Ukraine
*  that it took the Russians months to capture.
*  They finally did capture it in May.
*  But something that happened as the war went along is that Prigozhin increasingly started
*  marketing his Wagner forces as a separate entity.
*  There's a public relations aspect to this, where Prigozhin, he's on social media almost
*  every day, releasing voice messages, videos, where he talks about what's happening on the
*  ground in a totally different kind of language than what we hear from the official spokespeople
*  for the Russian military.
*  He's much more honest about the fact that this is a war, that people are dying.
*  Right.
*  There are videos where he's actually showing the corpses of Russians killed in the fighting.
*  And then...
*  He starts going on the attack against the Russian military brass.
*  He uses incredibly harsh, profane language to denigrate the leadership of the Russian military.
*  Almost every day for the last few months, Prigozhin has been saying that Russia's top
*  generals, their defense minister, Sergey Shoigu, and the head of the general staff, General
*  Valeriy Gerasimov, he's been saying that they're incompetent, that they're indifferent to their
*  soldiers' lives.
*  He has said that Shoigu should be tried for treason.
*  I mean, really wild, intense stuff.
*  And obviously, we're all watching this just in shock as to how someone can keep saying
*  these things about the Russian military and not be punished for it in some way, given
*  how harshly Putin has been cracking down on so many other people who have criticized the
*  military over the last 16 months.
*  So what's the answer?
*  Like, what does Putin actually think?
*  Is he backing him?
*  Well, Putin said nothing.
*  And frankly, the only possible explanation is that Putin personally is protecting Prigozhin.
*  Putin probably felt that Prigozhin was necessary for the Russian war effort to proceed.
*  So that emboldened Prigozhin, and he kept on pushing and pushing and really escalating
*  that criticism in a remarkable way.
*  But then earlier this month, something important happened, which is that the Russian
*  authorities ordered that all volunteers and mercenaries fighting for the Russian side
*  in Ukraine needed to sign contracts with the regular military.
*  It was really a moment where it looked like the Russian government was finally going to
*  dismantle Wagner as an independent force.
*  So is this Putin turning away from Prigozhin?
*  It was kind of the closest we saw Putin come to that because Putin publicly backed that
*  order. And if this order were to be carried out, Prigozhin would lose command.
*  Of his huge fighting force.
*  And Prigozhin's frustration with all of this seemed to come to a head on Friday when he
*  released a remarkable 30 minute video where he went above and beyond all of his criticism
*  of the Russian authorities thus far.
*  He not only went after the generals, as he often does, he went after the fundamental
*  justification that Putin laid out for the invasion of Ukraine.
*  Extraordinary.
*  Yeah. So Prigozhin says in this video that Ukraine did not actually pose a threat to
*  Russia when Russia invaded in 2022.
*  He describes the war as a quote, racket that military officials and elites are using just
*  to profit. And, you know, he doesn't actually mention Putin by name, but it's sort of by
*  far the most confrontational video from him that we saw.
*  You could see, you know, on social media, even among bloggers who supported the war,
*  they were saying, wow, this is a bit intense, but here's a guy who's kind of finally saying
*  things that should be said, you know, and I think it also showed us how Prigozhin was
*  trying to turn himself into a politician, into a populist politician, kind of saying
*  these things that officially are not being said.
*  So then what happens after this shocking video?
*  So this is when things get really crazy.
*  About six hours later, he claims that the Russian military fired at the encampments of
*  his Wagner soldiers and killed huge numbers of Wagner soldiers.
*  And was that true, Anton?
*  We don't have any independent evidence that it was true.
*  But whatever the case, he says on Friday night that we're going to retaliate and there's
*  25000 of us.
*  And then shortly after that, we start seeing images of military equipment on the streets
*  of Rostov, a city of a million people near the border with Ukraine that is a base for
*  Wagner.
*  So it starts to become clear that an armed rebellion is underway.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Anton, by Saturday morning, things had really deteriorated.
*  Walk us through what happened next.
*  Saturday morning is when we see that this rebellion is for real.
*  An armed rebellion is apparently underway in Russia.
*  In the Russian city of Rostov, armed men and armor on the streets.
*  The Wagner chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, is saying that his group actually took control of the
*  military headquarters in Rostov.
*  Prigozhin's troops roll into the city of Rostov on dawn, the southern military headquarters,
*  which is the nerve center for the invasion.
*  And he says they did that, and I'm quoting him now, without firing a shot.
*  It's just this remarkable moment because some kind of non-official armed force has taken
*  control of a major Russian city.
*  OK, so remarkable.
*  Like, he has control of this Russian city, as it appears, and of the Russian military
*  headquarters for Ukraine.
*  What happens next?
*  So Prigozhin releases a video where he's sitting and negotiating with two very senior
*  generals.
*  Prigozhin says that until his forces get access to Shoygu and Gorosimov, he says, we'll
*  block the city of Rostov and we'll go to Moscow.
*  And that's what happens.
*  There are significant reports now that columns, hundreds of vehicles potentially, are moving
*  north halfway to Moscow.
*  His forces march toward Moscow in these long columns going along a major highway.
*  We don't know how big this column of vehicles is.
*  Hundreds of vehicles potentially are moving north, hours away from Moscow, and largely
*  unopposed.
*  The capital is bracing itself for repercussions of Wagner's advance towards Moscow.
*  If they get there, unclear, but their progress is reasonably fast.
*  Meanwhile, what's the Russian military doing?
*  They seem to completely be at a loss.
*  So they didn't fight back when Prigozhin's forces took over that key military facility
*  in Rostov.
*  There are a few cases where it looks like the Russian military does try to attack that
*  column of Wagner forces, but they fire back.
*  And there were several helicopters that we believe were shot down by Wagner forces.
*  Otherwise, it seems like the Russian authorities just don't know what to do.
*  There are a lot of images coming in at this point of the Russian military trying to stop
*  some kind of defense of Moscow.
*  Local governors, the mayor of Moscow, were urging people to stay off the streets.
*  There were various pro-Kremlin public figures on social media warning of the risk of civil
*  war.
*  So there were just all these jitters.
*  And where was Putin in all of this, Anton?
*  What was he saying?
*  Was he saying anything?
*  So he didn't say anything Friday night as this rebellion started to unfold.
*  He finally spoke up in a five-minute speech at around 10 a.m. Moscow time on Saturday.
*  He tried to look determined, but he also clearly looked rattled.
*  He never said Prigozhin's name in that speech, but he called him a traitor.
*  He was saying that Prigozhin was stabbing his country in the back just as it was fighting
*  this war in Ukraine.
*  Putin warned of anarchy and fratricide and promised tough actions to stop this rebellion.
*  So Putin taking a clear, hard line against Prigozhin.
*  What happens next, Anton?
*  So the situation seems to be escalating.
*  There are reports of isolated firefights, more helicopters, even planes being shot down
*  by the Wagner forces.
*  And there's a point where they get to just over 100 miles from Moscow.
*  We're talking a two-hour drive.
*  Crazy.
*  So at this point, we're thinking what will happen when they actually get to the outskirts
*  of Moscow?
*  Will there be large-scale fighting that breaks out?
*  Will they be able to enter the Russian capital?
*  And then finally, at around 10 p.m. Moscow time.
*  So just about 24 hours into this whole thing, there's a breakthrough.
*  And we get word that there's been some kind of deal struck where Prigozhin agrees to turn
*  his military columns around, call off the march on Moscow, and in exchange get some
*  kind of immunity.
*  Okay, needle off the record.
*  Like what happened?
*  What was the deal?
*  Well, there's obviously a lot here that we simply don't know.
*  But what the Kremlin did say publicly was that Prigozhin was going to have the criminal
*  investigation against him dropped.
*  He was going to be able to go to Belarus, and the fighters who rebelled alongside Prigozhin
*  were not going to be prosecuted.
*  And is that it?
*  I mean, does the Wagner group still exist?
*  Very much unclear.
*  I have a hard time believing that it's just going to go away.
*  But at the end of the night, Saturday night, we saw them withdraw from Rostov.
*  We saw footage of Prigozhin leaving the Rostov military headquarters.
*  So really, in a span of just over 24 hours, this insurrection goes from start to this
*  strange conclusion.
*  So, Anton, help me make sense of this.
*  I mean, what is it that we just witnessed?
*  Would you actually call it a coup?
*  I'm not sure that it was a coup because Prigozhin never said that he actually wanted Putin
*  out of office.
*  In fact, it really looked like he was hoping to make some kind of deal with Putin.
*  But this was an incredibly dramatic and dangerous threat to Putin's power.
*  You had one group of fighters taking control of key facilities in the city of Rostov on
*  dawn.
*  You had another column of fighters making that long drive to Moscow.
*  It was the first time that you had such a large, powerful armed force training its guns
*  at Putin's army.
*  Well, Anton, to that point, what did we just learn about Putin and his power?
*  What did this weekend show us?
*  It shows us how incredibly unstable and vulnerable this system that Putin built has turned out
*  to be.
*  Putin's power does not rest on institutions like parliament or the justice system or even
*  the police.
*  It's all about these personal, informal ties that he has built with people in his inner
*  circle and the elite.
*  And he has thrived for many years by figuring out how to manage all those informal ties
*  in a way that people's loyalties go to him and he can kind of stay in control of this
*  chaotic system.
*  What happened this past weekend was that that chaos finally got the better of Putin.
*  All of a sudden, one of these key players in that constellation of informal power centers
*  got out of Putin's control.
*  Like Frankenstein's monster, right?
*  Putin created the monster, Prokofiev, and that monster ended up coming after his creator.
*  Well, yeah, you know, the problem obviously with this kind of system that is all dependent
*  upon informal ties and personalities rather than institutions is that it becomes vulnerable
*  to the whims of the various individuals involved, especially as we've also seen when you have
*  a war that increases the stresses on the system by many, many times, things become very
*  unpredictable.
*  And that's what happened here.
*  This, of course, doesn't mean that Putin is going to collapse overnight, but this type
*  of scenario is one that very few people were able to lucidly envision.
*  And all of a sudden, we see that actually it is possible to lead an armed uprising in
*  Putin's Russia.
*  And that creates all kinds of questions as to how Putin is able to maintain legitimacy
*  and maintain control in the months and years to come.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Friday, the Supreme Court ruled that the Biden administration had the power to set
*  its own priorities for which undocumented immigrants to arrest and which to leave alone,
*  rejecting a challenge from two conservative states which had pressed for more aggressive
*  enforcement.
*  The eight to one ruling was a major victory for the Biden administration, which has sought
*  to balance control of the southern border with humane treatment of immigrants.
*  The court ruled that the states that brought the case, Texas and Louisiana, did not have
*  standing to sue, signaling a skepticism to further legal challenges by states to immigration
*  measures, which are traditionally the domain of the federal government.
