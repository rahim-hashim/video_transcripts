*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverny-Sea, and this is the Daily.
*  An armed rebellion in Russia over the weekend stunned the world and amounted to the single
*  biggest challenge to Vladimir Putin's rule since he came to power 23 years ago.
*  Today, my colleague Anton Trinovsky, I'm the man who led the revolt and what his
*  brief but bold rebellion tells us about the future of political power in Russia.
*  It's Monday, June 26.
*  So Anton, I think it's safe to say that we witnessed something extraordinary in Russia over
*  the weekend. And the first thing I wanted to do was to call you and ask you what was going on,
*  what it was that we were witnessing. I mean, what has transpired in Russia over the last 72
*  hours really is an incredibly extraordinary event that all of us will be interpreting, deciphering,
*  for weeks, months, maybe years to come. It was an armed rebellion from all we can tell.
*  It was a leader of a mercenary force, his name is Yvgeny Prigotin, marching columns of
*  thousands of fighters armed with tanks, with artillery, with anti-aircraft batteries,
*  into Russia. And it raised the specter of Russian fighting Russians of civil war.
*  It was really just breathtaking. I mean, the whole weekend, all Russian nerds, I know,
*  including my own husband, were just texting with Russian friends, just kind of gobsmacked at how
*  this could actually be happening. But let's take this just about that. Why don't you first tell us,
*  Anton, who is this guy, Yvgeny Prigotin, and remind us where he started, how we got to be where he was.
*  He is a very murky figure with a criminal past. He was born in the Soviet Union in 1961 in
*  the city that was then known as Lennon Grad, now called St. Petersburg. He spent 10 years in a
*  Soviet prison for robbery and to other crimes. He then got out. And in the 1990s became a businessman.
*  He opened a hot dog stand, eventually other restaurants, convenience stores, around the year 2000.
*  So that was Putin's first year as president. That is when he says he first met Vladimir Putin.
*  His story goes that he catered a meal for Putin and the Japanese Prime Minister.
*  He somehow won Putin's trust and became a kind of unofficial problem-solver for Putin.
*  A sort of fixer operating in the shadows whose loyalty was to Putin above all.
*  He became very rich. He got enormous government contracts in catering, in construction,
*  and he really was one of these classic figures of the Putin era who really owed their success
*  to their connections to Putin.
*  And remind us how exactly is Prigotin serving Putin?
*  Well, probably the most important way in which Prigotin kind of quietly serves Putin
*  out of the public eye is by forming this mercenary fighting group called Wagner,
*  essentially a private army that's not part of the Russian military.
*  And why Anton would Putin need that? I mean, you know, he controls this massive Russian army,
*  right? Like why a private one?
*  So remember Putin as a former KGB agent seems very comfortable operating outside the public eye.
*  And Prigotin's private army gave the Russian government and the Kremlin the ability
*  to have operations carried out on its behalf from which Putin and Russian officials could remain
*  at arm's length. So an early example of that was 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea and
*  foemen to the separatist war in eastern Ukraine. We saw Wagner troops join the fight on the Russian
*  side there. We saw it again later on after Russia intervened in the Syrian civil war in 2015.
*  Wagner forces provided those Russian boots on the ground. And we saw it in Africa in recent years,
*  places like the Central African Republic where Wagner forces have been providing security for
*  various governments while also helping the Kremlin expand its influence across the continent.
*  So kind of secret militia forces engaging really in major global conflicts.
*  Absolutely. Up until the war in Ukraine, Prigotin operated almost completely in the shadows.
*  In fact, he didn't even acknowledge that he was the guy behind the Wagner group.
*  Prigotin almost never appeared in public, never gave interviews. We saw very, very little of him.
*  Then Putin invades Ukraine in February of 2022.
*  It goes very badly. Putin expected Ukraine to fall within days or weeks. Instead,
*  Ukraine put up this tremendous resistance that the Russian regular military was simply not able to
*  handle. And that was when Wagner got involved. And not only did Prigotin send his highly trained and
*  experienced mercenary forces into Ukraine. He also starts this incredible recruitment drive
*  in Russian prisons that must have clearly been blessed by Putin himself.
*  There's this video that gets leaked on to the Telegram messaging app last fall,
*  where we see Prigotin standing in a prison courtyard in Russia surrounded by a circle of prisoners.
*  And you can hear him laying out the terms of his recruitment.
*  Which is basically you come fight for us for six months if you try to do something bad. We shoot you.
*  If you survive, you have your freedom.
*  Which was kind of remarkable at the time I remember Anton because this was kind of the first time
*  we'd ever really seen the guy in action in his mercenary role, right? Exactly. Yeah. And this
*  became the beginning of Prigotin going from this man who operated purely in the shadows to
*  increasingly a public figure. And how important is this Wagner fighting force to the overall Russian
*  war effort? Well, very important. You know, numerically they're smaller, but we're still talking about
*  tens of thousands of fighters certainly with those prisoners who were recruited. The Wagner
*  group is more agile, more flexible, maybe even in some ways more skilled than the Russian military.
*  They were critical, for instance, in the battle for Bachmout that city in eastern Ukraine that
*  it took the Russians months to capture. They finally did capture it in May. But something that
*  happened as the war went along is that Prigotin increasingly started marketing his Wagner forces
*  as a separate entity. There is a public relations aspect to this where Prigotin
*  he's on social media almost every day. Releasing voice messages,
*  videos where he talks about what's happening on the ground in a totally different kind of language
*  than what we hear from the official spokespeople for the Russian military.
*  He's much more honest about the fact that this is a war that people are dying.
*  Their videos where he's actually showing the corpses of Russians killed in the fighting.
*  He starts going on the attack against the Russian military brass.
*  He uses incredibly harsh profane language to denigrate the leadership of the Russian military.
*  Almost every day for the last few months Prigotin has been saying that Russia's top generals,
*  their defense minister Sergei Shogu and the head of the general staff, General Valery Gerasimov,
*  he's been saying that they're incompetent, that they're indifferent to their soldiers' lives.
*  He has said that Shogu should be tried for treason. I mean, really wild intense stuff. And obviously
*  we're all watching this just in shock as to how someone can keep saying these things about
*  the Russian military and not be punished for it in some way, given how harshly Putin has been
*  cracking down on so many other people who have criticized the military over the last 16 months.
*  So what's the answer? Like what does Putin actually think? Is he backing him?
*  Well, Putin said nothing. And frankly, the only possible explanation is that Putin personally is
*  protecting Prigotin. Putin probably felt that Prigotin was necessary for the Russian war effort
*  to proceed. So that emboldened Prigotin. And he kept on pushing and pushing and really escalating
*  that criticism in a remarkable way. But then earlier this month, something important happened,
*  which is that the Russian authorities ordered that all volunteers and mercenaries
*  fighting for the Russian side in Ukraine needed to sign contracts with the regular military.
*  It was really a moment where it looked like the Russian government was finally going to dismantle
*  Wagner as an independent force.
*  So is this Putin turning away from Prigotin?
*  It was kind of the closest we saw Putin come to that because Putin publicly backed that order.
*  And if this order were to be carried out, Prigotin would lose command of his huge fighting force.
*  And Prigotin's frustration with all of this seemed to come to a head on Friday when he released
*  a remarkable 30-minute video where he went above and beyond all of his criticism of the Russian
*  authorities thus far.
*  The military is here, but it doesn't seem to be seen in Ukraine.
*  He not only went after the generals, as he often does, he went after the fundamental
*  justification that Putin laid out for the invasion of Ukraine.
*  Extraordinary.
*  Yeah, so Prigotin says in this video that Ukraine did not actually pose a threat to Russia when Russia
*  invaded in 2022.
*  He describes the war as a quote, racket that military officials and elites are using just to profit.
*  And he doesn't actually mention Putin by name, but it's sort of by far the most
*  confrontational video from him that we saw.
*  I think it's a whole belief.
*  You could see on social media, even among bloggers who supported the war, they were saying, wow,
*  this is a bit intense, but here's a guy who's finally saying things that should be said.
*  I think it also showed us how Prigotin was trying to turn himself into a politician,
*  into a populist politician, kind of saying these things that officially are not being said.
*  So then what happens after this shocking video?
*  So this is when things get really crazy.
*  About six hours later, he claims that the Russian military fired at the encampments of his
*  Wagner soldiers and killed huge numbers of Wagner soldiers.
*  And was that true, Anton?
*  We don't have any independent evidence that it was true, but whatever the case, he says on Friday
*  night that we're going to retaliate and there's 25,000 of us.
*  And then shortly after that, we start seeing images of military equipment on the streets of
*  Rostov, a city of a million people near the border with Ukraine that is a base for Wagner.
*  So it starts to become clear that an armed rebellion is underway.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Anton, by Saturday morning, things had really deteriorated.
*  Walk us through what happened next.
*  Saturday morning is when we see that this rebellion is for real.
*  An armed rebellion is apparently underway in Russia.
*  In the Russian city of Rostov, armed men and armament on the streets.
*  The Wagner chief, you have any progoation is saying that his group actually took control
*  of the military headquarters in Rostov.
*  Progozion's troops roll into the city of Rostov, Anton.
*  The southern military headquarters, which is the nerve center for the invasion.
*  He says they did that and I'm quoting him now without firing a shot.
*  It's just this remarkable moment because some kind of non-official armed force has taken control
*  of a major Russian city.
*  Okay, so remarkable.
*  Like he has control of this Russian city as it appears and of the Russian military headquarters
*  for Ukraine. What happens next?
*  So progozion releases a video.
*  Where he's sitting and negotiating with two very senior generals.
*  Progozion says that until his forces get access to Shorygu and Garasimov,
*  he says we'll block the city of Rostov and we'll go to Moscow.
*  And that's what happens.
*  There are significant reports now that columns hundreds of vehicles potentially are moving north
*  halfway to Moscow.
*  His forces march toward Moscow in these long columns going along a major highway.
*  We don't know how big this column of vehicles is.
*  Hundreds of vehicles potentially are moving north hours away from Moscow and largely on a post.
*  The capsule is bracing itself for repercussions of Wagner's advance towards Moscow.
*  If I get there unclear, that progress is reasonably fast.
*  Meanwhile, what's the Russian military doing?
*  They seem to completely be at a loss.
*  So they didn't fight back when pregozion's forces took over that key military facility in Rostov.
*  There are a few cases where it looks like the Russian military does try to attack that column
*  of Wagner forces, but they fire back.
*  And there were several helicopters that we believe were shot down by Wagner forces.
*  Otherwise, it seems like the Russian authorities just don't know what to do.
*  There are a lot of images coming in at this point of the Russian military trying to set up
*  some kind of defensive Moscow.
*  Local governors, the mayor of Moscow, were urging people to stay off the streets.
*  There were various pro-Cremlin public figures on social media warning of the risk of civil war.
*  So there were just all these jitters.
*  And where was Putin in all of this, Anton?
*  What was he saying? Was he saying anything?
*  So he didn't say anything Friday night as this rebellion started to unfold.
*  He finally spoke up in a five-minute speech at around 10 AM Moscow time on Saturday.
*  I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
*  You know, he tried to look determined, but he also clearly looked rattled.
*  He never said pregozion's name in that speech, but he called him a traitor.
*  He was saying that pregozion was stabbing his country in the back
*  just as it was fighting this war in Ukraine,
*  Putin warned of anarchy and fratricide,
*  and promised tough actions to stop this rebellion.
*  So Putin taking a clear hard line against pregozion.
*  What happens next, Anton?
*  So the situation seems to be escalating.
*  There are reports of isolated firefights,
*  more helicopters, even planes being shot down by the Wagner forces.
*  And there's a point where they get to just over 100 miles for Moscow.
*  We're talking a two-hour drive.
*  Crazy.
*  So at this point, we're thinking what will happen when they actually get to the outskirts of Moscow?
*  Will there be large-scale fighting that breaks out?
*  Will they be able to enter the Russian capital?
*  And then finally at around 10 p.m., the Moscow time.
*  So just about 24 hours into this whole thing, there's a breakthrough.
*  And we get word that there's been some kind of deal struck,
*  where pregozion agrees to turn his military columns around,
*  call off the march on Moscow, and in exchange get some kind of immunity.
*  Okay, needle off the record.
*  Like what happened?
*  What was the deal?
*  Well, there's obviously a lot here that we simply don't know.
*  But what the Kremlin did say publicly was that pregozion was going to have the criminal
*  investigation against him dropped.
*  He was going to be able to go to Belarus,
*  and the fighters who rebelled alongside pregozion were not going to be prosecuted.
*  And is that it?
*  I mean, does the Wagner group still exist?
*  Very much unclear.
*  I have a hard time believing that it's just going to go away.
*  But at the end of the night, Saturday night, we saw them withdraw from Rostov.
*  We saw footage of pregozion leaving the Rostov military headquarters.
*  So really, in a span of just over 24 hours, this insurrection goes from start to this strange conclusion.
*  So Anton, help me make sense of this.
*  I mean, what is it that we just witnessed?
*  Would you actually call it a coup?
*  I'm not sure that it was a coup, because pregozion never said that he actually wanted
*  Putin out of office.
*  In fact, it really looked like he was hoping to make some kind of deal with Putin.
*  But this was an incredibly dramatic and dangerous threat to Putin's power.
*  You had one group of fighters taking control of key facilities in the city of Rostov,
*  Anton. You had another column of fighters making that long drive to Moscow.
*  It was the first time that you had such a large, powerful armed force training its guns at Putin's army.
*  Well, Anton, to that point, what did we just learn about Putin and his power?
*  What did this weekend show us?
*  It shows us how incredibly unstable and vulnerable this system that Putin built has turned out to be.
*  Putin's power does not rest on institutions like parliament or the justice system or even the police.
*  It's all about these personal informal ties that he has built with people in his inner circle
*  and the elite. And he has thrived for many years by figuring out how to manage all those
*  informal ties in a way that people's loyalties go to him and he can kind of stay in control of this
*  chaotic system. What happened this past weekend was that that chaos finally got the better of Putin.
*  All of a sudden, one of these key players in that constellation of informal power centers
*  got out of Putin's control.
*  Like Frankenstein's monster, right? Putin created the monster,
*  Progozhyn, and that monster ended up coming after his creator.
*  Well, yeah, the problem obviously with this kind of system that is all dependent upon
*  informal ties and personalities rather than institutions is that it becomes vulnerable to the
*  whims of the various individuals involved, especially as we've also seen when you have a war
*  that increases the stresses on the system by many, many times, things become very unpredictable.
*  And that's what happened here.
*  This of course doesn't mean that Putin is going to collapse overnight, but this type of scenarios
*  one that very few people were able to lucidly envision. And all of a sudden, we see that actually
*  it is possible to lead an armed uprising in Putin's Russia.
*  And that creates all kinds of questions as to how Putin is able to maintain legitimacy
*  and maintain control in the months and years to come.
*  Anton, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Friday, the Supreme Court ruled that the Biden administration had the power to set its own
*  priorities for which undocumented immigrants to arrest and which to leave alone, rejecting a
*  challenge from two conservative states which had pressed for more aggressive enforcement.
*  The 8-1 ruling was a major victory for the Biden administration, which is sought to balance
*  control of the southern border with humane treatment of immigrants.
*  The court ruled that the states that brought the case, Texas and Louisiana,
*  did not have standing to sue, signaling escapacism to further legal challenges by states to
*  immigration measures, which are traditionally the domain of the federal government.
