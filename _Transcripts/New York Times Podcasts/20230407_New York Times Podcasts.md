# The Outsourcing of Americaâ€™s Border Problem
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1wxdHPlkMk)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  At least 40 migrants are dead after a fire at a detention center in Mexico near the US border.
*  One by one, Mexican soldiers pull people out of the building.
*  Mylar blankets covering the dead, 28 seriously hurt.
*  A fatal fire in an immigrant detention center in Juarez, Mexico.
*  Before the fire, Mexican police arrested migrants off the streets and threw them into the cells.
*  Many of the shelters there were oversaturated and overwhelmed, overcrowded.
*  Raised troubling questions about the ways immigration is being handled by the United States.
*  There is no question that we have a very serious challenge.
*  Today, my colleague, Simone Romero, on how America outsourced its immigration dilemma to Mexico
*  and brought cities like Juarez to a breaking point.
*  It's Friday, April 7th.
*  So, Simone, you've been doing a lot of reporting at the US border with Mexico.
*  And I know recently you've been focused on this terrible fire that broke out at a detention center just on the Mexican side.
*  What have you found out in the time since it broke out?
*  So on Monday, March 27th, authorities in Ciudad Juarez in northern Mexico went around the city
*  and they began rounding up dozens of migrants after receiving complaints that they had been begging or harassing people on the streets of the city.
*  And they took them to this facility which really resembles a jail more than a shelter.
*  And it lies just steps away from the border with the United States.
*  One of the men picked up that day was a Venezuelan and husband of a woman I met in Juarez, Viangly Infante Padron.
*  I went to Pia de las Negras on December 22 and I went to the United States and they expelled me along with my children.
*  She told me that she had been traveling literally for months with their three young children
*  in a desperate attempt to get to the US border with the hope of applying for asylum.
*  And they had been staying in Juarez since December.
*  And the day that he was rounded up, she said that he had been out buying medication for their daughter
*  who has a medical condition that causes her to have seizures.
*  Almost immediately when she heard that he had been detained, she got up with her kids
*  and raced over to the facility with his migration papers.
*  She actually had to wait there with her children for hours pleading with officials trying to get him out,
*  trying to get him released.
*  Around 9 p.m. that evening, she was told that he would be released that night.
*  Suddenly, a smell started coming out, like a burning plastic, and my son told me,
*  Mom, something is burning.
*  But then I told him, what could it be?
*  But shortly after, her son noticed the smell of something burning.
*  I heard screams, the screams of them, and they heard that they were hitting the walls.
*  Then they heard the screams coming from lower down of the facility and banging on the walls.
*  But she said that migration officials were just sitting there as if they couldn't smell or hear anything.
*  But I didn't pay much attention to them because the migrants were sitting there very calmly,
*  talking as if nothing was happening.
*  Eventually, she said she sees them start to bring some women out,
*  but all of the men were still inside, including her husband.
*  And that's when she started to panic.
*  I started to argue with one of them and I said, why are they going to close the door
*  and not let the men in the cell?
*  Officials then told her to get out of the building, otherwise she could face some sort of legal consequences.
*  So she went to the outskirts of the facility.
*  She was stranded on the sidewalk outside, witnessing the fire trucks arriving.
*  When I'm on the street, I see dead bodies.
*  I don't see anyone alive, just dead bodies.
*  And she actually saw bodies being removed from the facility.
*  God!
*  Charred remains.
*  She didn't know if those were the remains of her husband or not, or who they belonged to.
*  Whoa!
*  And when I realized the ambulance, my husband was there.
*  Until she finally saw him.
*  He said he went into the bathroom and got wet.
*  He was in the bathroom.
*  That's why he didn't get burned, because he went into the bathroom immediately.
*  And she told me that he managed to survive by going into a bathroom at the facility
*  and covering himself in water in a desperate effort to prevent himself from being burned.
*  But he did emerge with serious smoke inhalation injuries, and was immediately hospitalized.
*  So, Simone, that's just an unbelievably painful account of what happened during the fire.
*  Do we have any more information about how it actually started?
*  So the first pieces of information that we have came from Mexican government officials.
*  They said that some of the migrants being held in the facility
*  started the blaze by lighting mattresses on fire as a form of protest.
*  Apparently these migrants who were being held, they were upset, first of all,
*  that they had been detained without having committed any crimes,
*  and were protesting the conditions inside.
*  They were contending that they hadn't been given any water.
*  They were being held behind bars in essentially what they viewed as a jail.
*  But pretty quickly, surveillance videos surfaced presenting a darker side to what had happened.
*  There's video from inside the facility that shows uniform people saw the smoke filling the cells,
*  and then left without opening the cells or the doors, effectively leaving men trapped inside.
*  Oh, man.
*  And now there's a homicide investigation into the fire, and at least five people have been arrested.
*  Three government employees, a security guard for a private contractor,
*  and one of the detainees accused of actually starting the blaze.
*  And really, while this fire is obviously tragic, it's also the latest in a long chain of events
*  and pressure that's been building in policy change after policy change
*  that has been keeping people amassed in cities like Juarez along the border.
*  Okay, so tell me about that, Simone. Where does that story begin?
*  Well, there have been decades of failed immigration policies that certainly play a role.
*  But as far as where to start this current chapter of the story,
*  all of that has been exacerbated since the depths of the pandemic.
*  And that's due to the embrace of an arcane rule known as Title 42 that was used by the Trump
*  administration to quickly expel migrants who were showing up at the border and even some seeking
*  asylum. This was presumably to prevent them from transmitting COVID due to fears over infections
*  at that point. And when the Biden administration came in, they tried to discard this rule, but they
*  weren't able to do so. There was a huge legal battle that went all the way up to the Supreme Court,
*  and the rule was kept in place. And so this meant that large numbers of migrants coming from many
*  countries simply could not get into the United States during the pandemic. But there was one
*  critical exception, and that was for people coming from countries like Venezuela, with which the
*  United States has very bad or very tense diplomatic relations. It meant that U.S. officials
*  simply cannot send those people back to those countries. They cannot deport Venezuelans back
*  to Venezuela. So then those people were getting into the United States?
*  Many of them were being able to enter the United States, yes, as part of the process that involves
*  them applying for asylum. And, you know, this was adding political pressure at the time. This was
*  ahead of the midterms, we have to remember. And we had a lot of Democratic candidates running in
*  border states like Arizona, like Texas, who were coming under criticism because of this influx.
*  So in October, the Biden administration made a change that really just upended everything.
*  They struck a deal with Mexico that, among other things, allowed them to send Venezuelans back to
*  Mexico. So effectively closed the exception for Venezuelans. That's exactly what they did. And
*  this led to plummeting numbers of arrivals of Venezuelans on the U.S. side. And so this policy
*  really worked so well that the Biden administration then applied it to other countries such as Cuba,
*  such as Nicaragua, with which the U.S. also has strained diplomatic relations.
*  But while the numbers were plummeting on the U.S. side, Mexico had to continue dealing with this influx.
*  Why did Mexico agree to it?
*  Well, we have to remember that Mexico really had already come under immense pressure during the
*  Trump administration to do something, to do anything about the situation along the border.
*  The United States exerts immense influence in Mexico's economy. It remains Mexico's largest
*  trading partner. Also, it's kind of in a way politically expedient for Mexico's president,
*  because with a deal like this, Mexico's president can really pursue his domestic policies without
*  much explicit criticism from Washington. That's a big deal for him. And that's really effectively
*  been the case. The U.S. has largely been hands off in terms of criticizing him, especially when it
*  comes to weakening an election law. So the deal to close this exception to Title 42 went into effect
*  in October. And from the U.S. perspective, it worked. But the problem didn't go away. It just
*  shifted to the other side of the border. And so effectively, what we're seeing on the ground
*  is an outsourcing of the immigration dilemma from the United States to Mexico, where migrants are
*  still arriving in huge numbers, where they're amassing. And you see this especially on the
*  streets of Juarez. We'll be right back.
*  So, Simone, what does this increase in migrants along the border look like in Juarez? Like,
*  how has this border city been affected? Well, we really have to remember what Juarez is.
*  It's a city that really views itself as a place of migration, as a place of refuge, as a place of
*  passage. The original name for the entire area was El Paso del Norte, the pass of the north,
*  reflecting how people have been transiting through this area for hundreds of years. What's
*  different now, though, is that instead of passing through, they're stuck. They're staying put for
*  weeks or months at a time. And why? Why are they stuck? So there are two big reasons. One is a new
*  app that the U.S. introduced, which these restricted nationalities under Title 42 must now use to secure
*  an appointment where they can request asylum. In the past, you could turn yourself in at the border,
*  ask for asylum, and either be allowed in temporarily or be deported. The app essentially makes that step
*  virtual. And you have to apply for that asylum appointment using the app from Mexico. Got it. So
*  essentially, the sorting process for who's likely to get asylum happens in Mexico instead of the U.S.
*  That's right. And this app has just been plagued with issues and different kinds of glitches.
*  And that's resulted in an even larger logjam of people hanging around on the border. Okay. So what's
*  the other reason people are hanging around longer? That has to do with the expectation that Title
*  42 is going to expire in May. So in anticipation of that, lots of people have gathered in border
*  towns with the idea that in a month or so, it'll be much easier to cross the border.
*  Okay. So you have all of these new migrants from places like Venezuela and Nicaragua who
*  would have gotten in before, but who are now being turned away. Then you have this glitchy app.
*  And on top of all of that, there's this anticipation that soon it will be easier to enter the United
*  States. And all of this together has created this kind of perfect storm for the situation on the
*  Mexican side of the border. That's right. And that's just a huge challenge for Juarez. You know,
*  what you're seeing now is that many of the people who would have crossed through are actually staying.
*  And immediately after crossing the bridge from downtown El Paso, you see entire families at
*  intersections there. They're often with infants. They're often begging for money. You see migrants
*  selling anything they can from sunglasses to flowers. They're cleaning the windshields of cars
*  that are stuck in traffic. You're seeing shelters way beyond their capacity. Families sleeping in
*  abandoned construction sites, literally sleeping on the streets. And the numbers are just growing.
*  They continue to amass in Juarez. And it's really just increasing pressure on the city in ways that
*  are kind of unprecedented, even for a place that views itself as welcoming, that views itself as a
*  place that's used to such migration. And what are people in Juarez saying? How do they see this?
*  Well, really, as the situation grows more dire and as the pressure increases, you can see that patience
*  is really wearing thin among many people in Juarez. And of course, amongst the migrants
*  themselves who have carried out protests about the time that they have to spend waiting on the Mexican
*  side, at one point in March, migrants tried to rush across one of the bridges connecting
*  El Paso and Juarez. And that just stunned many people. It shut down traffic on that bridge. And
*  people in Juarez, you know, they depend on those bridges to study on the other side, to work on the
*  other side, to see family on the other side. The economy of the city relies on those connections.
*  And, you know, that elicited really what was a rare positioning by the city's mayor.
*  After that incident on the bridge, he came out and said, we're running out of patience. The
*  city's economy cannot and should not be affected by the arrival of these migrants.
*  He also cited the presence of migrants at intersections and how that's affecting daily
*  life in the city. And that's really quite something. That was a change that's kind of
*  like really shook people. They're not used to hearing pronouncements like that from their
*  elected officials, from a city that really views itself as a place of refuge. So this is the mayor
*  saying out loud that the city's infrastructure is really being strained here, right? Like that they
*  just simply cannot support the sheer numbers. That's right. So you have the mayor saying that.
*  And at the same time, you also have law enforcement taking a tougher approach, becoming more aggressive
*  in their treatment of the migrants. You know, whether they're rounding up people, placing them
*  in these detention centers. We've heard from migrants who have said that they've had to pay
*  bribes to either migration officials or local police, even that they've had their identification
*  documents burned by some of these officials, which would make eventually getting to the
*  United States or applying for asylum even more difficult for them. And that creates a climate
*  of fear and tension on the streets. At the same time, you're hearing these expressions of concern
*  coming from elected officials. You're also hearing from religious figures, from volunteer
*  organizations, from shelter operators. These organizations have been fierce in their criticism
*  of what the mayor said. They're saying that's not what we're about. We have to stick to who we are.
*  And they believe that Wadashu remain a welcoming place that treats migrants with dignity.
*  It's very complex, of course.
*  You're from Juarez?
*  Yes, sir.
*  Yes? Born and raised?
*  Yes, sir. Thank you.
*  You know, I met one man who was born and raised in Juarez.
*  Carlos Armendariz.
*  Carlos Armendariz with a Z.
*  His name is Carlos Armendariz, and he makes a living selling used tools in downtown Juarez
*  on the street. Anything he can pick up, screwdrivers, hammers, saws. And, you know, he himself
*  was a migrant. He had worked in the United States for years in construction
*  and was even deported back to Mexico. And yet he's concerned.
*  He sees a lot of these migrants begging at intersections. And he said that that's a real
*  contrast with his own experience of trying to work hard and make a living.
*  And, you know, he just really questioned whether they have the same gumption that people of his
*  experience have had when they've had to really follow their own star across the border in
*  search of work and opportunity.
*  And is there any truth to what he's saying here? Like that these migrants could work but don't want to?
*  Many of them do actually work. I saw migrants, you know, selling staples of Venezuelan food,
*  like arepas on the streets. Really anything they could. At the same time, a lot of them can't work
*  legally in jobs in factories in Juarez, you know, that are open to migrants from parts of Mexico.
*  They don't have the right papers. They don't have a bank account. They just don't have the
*  infrastructure that's really necessary for jobs like that. But also the main reason many of them
*  might not seek long-term employment is because their goal is still getting into the United States,
*  not to stay in Juarez. So many of them are just waking up every single day trying to desperately
*  get their asylum appointment. And that means logging on to this app. You know, some of them
*  have one, two, three different cell phones that they're using. And really I spoke to dozens and
*  dozens of people when I was in Juarez. None of them got that appointment except for one person,
*  and that was Viangley, the woman whose husband survived the fire. Oh, wow. Yeah, it's just
*  incredible. And by the way, I mean, both she and her husband work every single day. She works in
*  an ice cream parlor. Her husband sells roses on the street. She managed to get an appointment.
*  That is extremely rare, but it still does offer a semblance of hope to many of the other people who
*  are trying to do the same thing. So Simone, is there any relief on the horizon? Like it just
*  feels like something in this situation has to give. You know, a lot of migrants and advocates
*  thought you might see some relief in May when Title 42 is set to lift. But for many people in
*  the United States who are looking to limit immigration, the system is working. Numbers of
*  arrivals have plummeted. They don't really have a lot of incentive to change things. And so people
*  are really waiting to see what's going to happen. The latest expectation is that the Biden
*  administration is going to revert to another measure for people deemed to have entered the
*  U.S. unlawfully, along with a proposal which would help determine when and how asylum seekers can be
*  expelled. Some people even jokingly refer to this new rule that's coming as Title 43. So in other
*  words, it's going to be more of the same. That's what a lot of people are saying along the border.
*  Mexico's economy continues to be extremely interconnected with that of the United States.
*  And the conditions that people are fleeing from in countries other than Mexico continue to be
*  extremely challenging economically and politically. It's just unlikely that any of these factors
*  leading to this situation are going to change anytime soon. So it's likely you're only going
*  to see this pressure continuing to build in border cities like Juarez. And what many people
*  fear is that tragedies like this fire are probably not the last that we're going to see.
*  Simone, thank you. Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. On Thursday, the Biden administration
*  weighed in on the
*  debate over transgender athletes, announcing a proposed rule change that would prohibit schools
*  from categorically banning transgender students from athletic teams that are consistent with
*  their gender identities. But the proposed change to Title IX, the federal civil rights law that
*  prevents discrimination based on sex in education programs, would also offer flexibility to limit
*  the participation of transgender students when including them could undermine, quote,
*  fairness in competition or potentially lead to injuries. And in the wake of a school shooting
*  in Nashville last week, three Democratic lawmakers took to the floor of the Republican-controlled
*  Tennessee House chamber and interrupted debate by leading protesters in a call for stricter gun laws.
*  On Thursday, in a dramatic act of political retribution, the state's legislature voted to
*  oust two of them. The ousted lawmakers, Justin Jones and Justin Pearson, two of the state's
*  youngest Black representatives, can run again for their seats. But the ousters temporarily leave
*  thousands of residents in Memphis and in Nashville without representation in the final weeks of
*  Tennessee's legislative session. Today's episode was produced by Carlos Prieto, Nina Feldman,
