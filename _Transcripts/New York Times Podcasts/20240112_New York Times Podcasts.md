# In Iowa, Two Friends Debate DeSantis vs. Trump
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGelUcu0GGc)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  You know, as governor of the Sunshine State, normally in January, I'm down in Florida
*  with all the Midwesterners storming down to escape the cold.
*  On Monday, when Iowa holds the first contest in the Republican presidential nominating
*  process, nobody will have more on the line than Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.
*  I don't like what the future looks like with another four years of Trump.
*  I would like somebody to step up and make that a challenge because it's really disappointing.
*  Who has staked his candidacy.
*  I really like Ron DeSantis much better.
*  On a victory there that now seems increasingly remote.
*  I came because I love Trump.
*  Everybody that I know is going for Trump.
*  Did you decide pretty early on in the process that you wanted to support Trump for 24?
*  No question.
*  There's no question.
*  I mean, how did both of you think about it?
*  Today, my colleagues, Shane Goldmacher, Rob Zipko, and Carlos Prieto, on what DeSantis'
*  challenge has looked like on the ground in Iowa.
*  This Friday, January 12th.
*  Shane, the question from the beginning of the Republican presidential race was, is there
*  anyone who can beat Donald Trump?
*  And as we sit here today, just a few days before the Iowa caucuses, the first Republican
*  vote, Trump is more than 30 points ahead of his nearest rival, which is about as daunting
*  and advantage as I've ever seen.
*  I think the question now is why exactly that has been the case and what have Trump's rivals
*  been trying to do in these final weeks and days to try to defy the laws of political
*  gravity and perhaps pull off some kind of a long shot upset in Iowa?
*  Well, you're right.
*  It is daunting and it's so daunting that a number of his former rivals have quit, including
*  Chris Christie, who left just this week.
*  And that's left really two people who are ostensibly still competing with Donald Trump
*  and that's Nikki Haley and it's Ron DeSantis.
*  And in a lot of ways, the race has become a race for second place between the two of
*  them.
*  And in that race, Nikki Haley has been gaining momentum and she's been raising money.
*  And while she's hoping to top DeSantis here, she's been more focused on the next states,
*  on New Hampshire, where she pulls more strongly and then her home state of South Carolina.
*  But for Ron DeSantis, it's really Iowa.
*  He has set himself apart by saying this is a state he will win and he's in a tough spot.
*  In a make or break state just days before the caucuses, he's found himself much closer
*  to Nikki Haley than to Donald Trump.
*  Right.
*  And we've talked about DeSantis with you a lot and about the fact that his campaign set
*  a series of major missteps, miscalculations and has had to really scale back its ambitions
*  and focus them on Iowa, not by choice, but a little bit by necessity.
*  Because his thinking is if we can do well in Iowa, maybe, just maybe he can kind of
*  resurrect this candidacy and make this a two candidate race with Trump.
*  Yeah, he has gone all in on Iowa.
*  He's visited every single county in the state, the only one of the top candidates to do so.
*  He is got the backing of the state's popular Republican governor.
*  He's won the backing of one of the most important evangelical networks in the state and his
*  super PAC has just been knocking on door after door, more than 800,000 doors in the state
*  so far.
*  Wow.
*  There's mailers, there's TV ads, it's hand to hand combat to find the very small number
*  going to show up on a really cold night in Iowa.
*  And the way the DeSantis team sees it is look, they're campaigning the Iowa way.
*  This is how some of those long shots surged at the last minute.
*  People like Rick Santorum, who were given little chance but had pounded the pavement
*  in all 99 counties, he won.
*  Rick Santorum, of course, went on to lose the nomination and really didn't gain a ton
*  of traction after Iowa.
*  And for the DeSantis campaign, this is the model.
*  Put in the maximum effort here.
*  And if it doesn't really work here, it's really hard to see how it's going to work for him
*  anywhere else.
*  Right.
*  Long shots can and sometimes do win in Iowa.
*  But given this daunting math of Trump's lead in the polls that we've just talked about,
*  I'm curious as you're describing this elaborate door to door, hand to hand combat by the DeSantis
*  campaign, what kind of voter he's trying to win over at this point?
*  Who exactly is the ideal target of this uphill DeSantis effort in Iowa?
*  I think it's really important to answer that, to go back to the assumptions that the DeSantis
*  campaign made at the very beginning of the race, which is that voters in a Republican
*  primary fall into three basic buckets.
*  The first bucket is the diehard Trump supporters, the people who are going to be with Trump
*  from the beginning to the end, and there's really nothing you can do to compete for them.
*  The second bucket is the sort of soft Trump supporters, people who like Donald Trump as
*  president, people who are open to supporting him again, but also are open to an alternative.
*  Maybe somebody without as much baggage, maybe somebody who was younger.
*  And then the third bucket is the never Trumpers, the people in the Republican Party who are
*  absolutely ready to move on and we're not going to support Trump no matter what.
*  And so their theory of the case was basically that that second bucket, the soft Trump bucket,
*  that that was the biggest of them all.
*  And there were even more people there than folks were presuming.
*  So at the heart of DeSantis' vision in a place like Iowa, you're saying is the belief that
*  perhaps there are actually a lot of people who are soft Trump supporters.
*  And therefore, if you're campaigning and you meet somebody who says, I'm a Trump supporter,
*  they actually might be available to DeSantis.
*  That is one of the essential questions of the entire Republican primary.
*  Just how many of those Trump supporters are actually persuadable in 2024?
*  And for the DeSantis campaign, it's the existential question.
*  And I think the best way to understand how the DeSantis campaign has approached this
*  is to meet a former Trump supporter who they actually won over.
*  Are you the Lance?
*  How's it going?
*  Good.
*  His name is Lance Loughbridge.
*  It's good to meet you.
*  Good to meet you too.
*  And he's become an ardent DeSantis supporter out in eastern Iowa.
*  Can you give us a quick tour of the farm before we sit down and talk?
*  Where two of our producers for the daily, Rob Zipko and Carlos Prieto, went to meet
*  him last week.
*  Yeah, let's see.
*  Let's go this way.
*  Okay, so tell us about Lance.
*  Well, he's a farmer who grows corn and he raises cattle.
*  I know you mentioned you're in the middle of calving season.
*  I just had two this morning.
*  And he's been busy with all the new calves being born.
*  You'll see them here in a second.
*  Let me jump over the fence real quick.
*  Actually Michael, the very first calf born in 2024 has a very special name.
*  The first one born this morning, we named him DeSantis 24.
*  It's DeSantis 24.
*  Like I said, this is a DeSantis success story.
*  And this cow is living on his farm of more than 1500 acres.
*  Does it ever get too cold for the cattle?
*  I've never had a cow freeze to death.
*  I've come close three times.
*  And for many years, that's really just how he thought of himself as a farmer, not as
*  somebody who was particularly politically engaged.
*  I really haven't always been into politics.
*  You know, in fact, I kind of despised him for most of my life.
*  But about a decade ago, that changed when he started working with what's really an important
*  organization in Iowa, the Iowa Corn Growers Association.
*  And it's a group that lobbies politicians on behalf of corn farmers across the state.
*  And I was asked to participate in a meeting there and was late to that meeting.
*  And when I got there, I found out they voted me in as the county president.
*  Don't ever be late to a meeting, right?
*  Lance says the politicians he was dealing with, they didn't actually understand farm
*  policy and they didn't understand really what life was like for a farmer.
*  And that whole experience, it was a big wake up call.
*  And as Lance is experiencing this awakening, how does he describe his politics?
*  Well, he describes himself as pretty conservative, as a Christian, pro-life.
*  And then when 2016 rolled around, as you listen to Trump and as he confronted the other party
*  and other GOP candidates, as far as that goes, he was intrigued by Donald Trump.
*  He wasn't afraid to come right out and say it.
*  And that I thought was something that we needed.
*  And he voted for him in 2016.
*  And then when Trump actually got into office, he liked a lot of what he had to say on certain
*  issues, especially on trade.
*  We're going to make the best deal with China.
*  China's going to buy our agricultural products.
*  It's going to be great.
*  Remember, Trump had promised he was going to renegotiate trade deals with China, that
*  business was going to get better for American businesses.
*  As a farmer, it made us think we've got a future ahead of us.
*  I've got a daughter and a son that have an opportunity now to potentially come into this
*  farming operation without having to sweat and lose sleep every night on whether they're
*  going to be able to pay the next bill.
*  And he in fact did start to rip up a lot of those trade agreements and understandings.
*  He imposed tariffs and he made a whole number of changes to American's relationship with
*  businesses abroad.
*  But Lance has all those Trump policies that sounded good.
*  They ended up backfiring for him.
*  As Lance tells it, when these tariffs are imposed, it was very difficult for equipment manufacturers
*  to source what they needed to build equipment.
*  It raises the cost of the raw materials he needs to make his farm work.
*  That made the price of equipment go up.
*  Things like farm equipment and fertilizer.
*  When those fertilizer tariffs got put into place, it becomes a higher cost to us.
*  And those tariffs also set off a trade war with China.
*  And China stopped buying a lot of American agricultural goods.
*  Hmm.
*  And Lance's businesses are getting squeezed.
*  They're getting squeezed on both sides.
*  His costs are going up and he's not making as much money when he sells his products across
*  America and across the world.
*  We were really standing on an edge of a cliff, ready to fall over.
*  And luckily we didn't, but it was not an easy time.
*  I don't ever want to go back to living like that.
*  In fact, he had to take part in a Trump administration program that amounted to a bailout for farmers
*  who all across the country were suffering from the trade war that had been started.
*  Hmm.
*  And so because of all of this, he starts to grow more and more disillusioned with Donald Trump.
*  We've got this motivating speaker, Trump, out there talking about how this is going to get better,
*  how it's going to be so much better, you know.
*  But in the background, we've got all these things that are falling apart.
*  Come election day though, did you vote for him?
*  Yes.
*  Yep.
*  And yet when we get to 2020, Lantz stuck with Trump in that election.
*  Hmm.
*  Why?
*  It's because he didn't like the alternative.
*  I wasn't a Biden fan.
*  I mean, I did not see anything good coming out of a Biden administration.
*  So what was the worser of the two evils?
*  You know, you kind of had to look at that.
*  Trump still had some good things going on for him.
*  So Lantz feels like a kind of classic Trump voter, liked Trump's tough stance on trade,
*  founded a non-establishment, anti-establishment figure in the White House, so voted for him
*  in 2016, stuck with him in 2020 despite some disappointments because there wasn't really
*  a primary that year and he wasn't going to vote for a Democrat.
*  Obviously, now in 2024, there is a primary, there are alternatives to Trump.
*  So how is Lantz thinking about 2024?
*  So at the beginning of the 2024 cycle, Lantz sort of fits into that soft Trump supporter
*  category, maybe even borderline opposed to Trump.
*  And he's determined to figure out, well, who will his Republican alternative be?
*  If I'm going to pick somebody, if I'm going to go out and pick that prize bull or that
*  prize cow and sorry, I don't mean to compare any of our candidates to cattle.
*  But if I'm going to go out and pick a winner, you know, I want to look at every attribute.
*  I want something that's got the whole package, you know.
*  And look, he's an influential figure in the farming community.
*  And so some of these candidates are actually seeking him out for meetings.
*  Well, I had an opportunity to meet with almost all of them.
*  I've met with Vivek, I've met with Doug, I've met with Nikki Haley.
*  And at some point, he eventually gets to meet Ron DeSantis.
*  So I was asked to meet with DeSantis.
*  He got out of the car, we exchanged pleasantries, we sat down at a table and I said, well,
*  it's just not beat around the bush.
*  Where are you at on agriculture and where are you out on biofuels?
*  I don't know. That's how he answered it.
*  I need to learn more.
*  I don't understand the industry.
*  Tell me more. How can I learn?
*  And he was impressed with DeSantis and how he seemed open to hearing his concerns about
*  his industry and his business.
*  After we had that conversation that day, one of his policymakers had called me and
*  said, hey, if you got time, let's talk about biofuels.
*  Let's talk about agriculture.
*  So I thought, wow, here's a candidate that had somebody call me and ask more specific
*  questions. And some weeks after that first meeting, Lance had another opportunity to
*  meet with DeSantis with a bunch of farmers from all across the state.
*  There must have been 30 or 40 farmers there.
*  And Governor DeSantis went around the room and introduced himself to every single person
*  individually and had a conversation with every single person individually.
*  So it was probably all of 40 minutes or better before we actually sat down and then had
*  more of a roundtable type meeting where guys could ask questions and talk about what's
*  important to them as far as agriculture goes.
*  How did you feel, though, at the end of that conversation?
*  I guess the two conversations at those different facilities.
*  Well, I hadn't made up my mind yet.
*  But I got to tell you that I've never seen a candidate engage people like that, whether
*  it was a senator, a representative or a presidential candidate.
*  And it wasn't long after that that Lance saw Ron DeSantis speaking on the campaign trail
*  in the exact kind of way he wanted based on what he'd heard from Iowa farmers.
*  Hmm.
*  I think a lot of those things that were talked about that day, he's incorporated into some
*  of his conversations and rallies.
*  So Lance is really liking DeSantis.
*  But what really clinches it is something that happens over the summer.
*  I was hit.
*  He got into a pretty serious motorcycle accident.
*  And it broke my leg and had some pretty severe damage.
*  It required some reconstructive surgery.
*  I got 36 staples, eight screws, a wire and a plate in my ankle and foot holding things
*  together.
*  I was laid up and it's a Saturday morning and I get a phone call and that phone call
*  was a no caller ID number.
*  And I thought it was the highway patrol calling me to, you know, ask questions about the
*  accident.
*  And it wasn't.
*  It was Governor DeSantis.
*  And Ron DeSantis actually called him to check in.
*  He said, Lance, yeah.
*  Hey, this is Ron DeSantis.
*  And I'm thinking, what?
*  He says, hey, he says, we heard you had an accident and we just we wanted to call and
*  see if you're doing OK.
*  What's going on?
*  And, you know, you all right.
*  And so we had a really nice conversation and it really wasn't about the campaign.
*  And he he he cared.
*  You know, that's how I felt.
*  That was very uplifting that day.
*  So it was really cool.
*  You know, I have to say, Shane, this is a bit surprising.
*  This is not the version of DeSantis that we have come to understand.
*  He is pretty widely seen as a little bit cold, disconnected, not somebody who easily
*  connects with voters.
*  I mean, Michael, it's striking in that there's this conventional wisdom that's congealed
*  about Ron DeSantis is that he's weak on the stump and that he's awkward and wooden.
*  And for Lance, he thinks that portrayal of Ron DeSantis, it's the media's fault, which
*  is, of course, what Ron DeSantis says, too, that they're not showing the real Ron DeSantis.
*  That is one thing that just absolutely frustrates me when I turn on the TV and you get
*  that from the media.
*  He's not that way.
*  And so Lance feels like he knows the real Ron DeSantis and he decides he's going to
*  support Ron DeSantis in the Iowa caucuses.
*  Which makes this, as you had hinted at earlier, a real success story for DeSantis's
*  high touch strategy in Iowa.
*  But it's the kind of success that would seem incredibly hard to replicate because you
*  can't call every voter who gets into an accident.
*  You can't call every voter in Iowa, period.
*  And if we're being honest, Lance is not just anybody, he's somebody who is influential.
*  So he's not entirely representative of Republican voters.
*  Right. This is a success, but it's a really hard one to repeat.
*  And so what Ron DeSantis needs is to convince Lance and then have Lance start to convince
*  other people on his behalf.
*  And actually, that's exactly what Lance decides to do.
*  He starts volunteering for the campaign to help get out the vote for Ron DeSantis.
*  Basically, I feel like if I'm going to be all in on somebody, then I need to be all
*  in on them. OK.
*  And I feel strongly that I've had a unique experience and I need to be able to share
*  that with others.
*  And what has that looked like?
*  Well, as he's recovering from his accident, he's sitting around his house and...
*  I'm sitting around and so I was calling and talking to people.
*  I was trying to keep myself busy and this was a good way to...
*  Hey, how you doing? You got a couple of minutes?
*  He says he's calling his friends and his family and other farmers.
*  I'm just kind of curious.
*  Where are you at in this caucus?
*  And there's one person from the campaign that has sent me multiple texts.
*  Like, here's one.
*  Will you call Darla?
*  Basically, anyone the campaign sends his way and says, any chance that you could call
*  Carmen? Hey, could you call this person, Lance?
*  She's got questions about the governor and she'd like to hear him from somebody else.
*  And a lot of these people are on the fence.
*  Yeah, I see. Like, I like him, but I really kind of like that Nikki Haley, you know, and
*  those sort of soft Trump supporters or maybe even opposed to Trump, but picking between two
*  candidates, looking at Nikki Haley or Ron DeSantis.
*  And I said, OK, yeah, she's not a horrible choice by any means.
*  But here's why I think DeSantis is better is because I've had the opportunity to have this
*  conversation. And Lance says he shares his experience with Ron DeSantis and the particular
*  things he likes about the governor.
*  How many calls would you guess that you've made?
*  Oh, in the hundreds?
*  It's almost it sounds like the campaign is kind of turning to you as their closer a little
*  bit. OK.
*  So how did Lance say that those calls have been going?
*  Lance has been having what he feels like his success.
*  He's flipping some people to Ron DeSantis, people who are kind of open to a Trump
*  alternative. But he's also realizing that some of the people he thought were open to a
*  Trump alternative turn out to be really, really hard to flip.
*  And one of the people he's had a really hard time flipping happens to be one of his really good
*  friends. So we asked Lance if we could sit down with him and his friend and hear how it's been
*  going as he's tried to pull him into the Ron DeSantis camp.
*  And he said yes.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Hey, Shane. How's it going?
*  Good. So, Shane, describe this conversation between Lance and his friend who Lance has been
*  trying to convert from Trump to DeSantis.
*  So last Sunday.
*  Hi, thanks for making the time, Shane.
*  Just about a week out from the caucus, Lance Lillard.
*  Lance, Rob and I headed out to Lance's farm to meet his friend, Nate Nating.
*  Nate, nice to meet you guys.
*  A guy by the name of Nate Nating.
*  Good. OK, I think we're ready to get started.
*  And we all sit down and Nate begins to tell us about himself.
*  I'm a farmer.
*  I should say that Nate's voice does sound a little bit like Lance's.
*  Got a few beef cows and also work for another farmer.
*  And that's about it.
*  How big is your farm?
*  I only own 38 acres.
*  OK, and how did you guys come to know each other, become friends?
*  Way back in school, in grade school.
*  Grade school?
*  Yeah, like since we were knee high to a grasshopper, probably, I suppose.
*  So probably since kindergarten or first grade, maybe.
*  Big enough to get in trouble.
*  Right.
*  And the two of them joke a lot.
*  I mean, you know, he drives green equipment.
*  I have red equipment.
*  What kind of motorcycles do you ride now?
*  Harley-Davidson.
*  Honda.
*  That's another thing.
*  He's got a Honda.
*  They joke a lot about how they're opposites.
*  He likes Trump.
*  I like DeSantis.
*  But they also started to talk about what they have in common.
*  But we both do not agree with Biden.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of common ground.
*  They both generally share the same worldview.
*  And Nate, like Lance.
*  I liked Trump just because he's not a politician.
*  Said that he was drawn to Donald Trump, basically from the start, back in 2016.
*  I just think he was more honest and more down to earth.
*  You could understand him more redneck.
*  I so interesting to me, because, you know, he's more redneck because he's,
*  you know, billionaire from Manhattan.
*  Right.
*  So how do you, how do you connect?
*  How does the billionaire from Manhattan feel like more redneck to you?
*  Well, he's, he's a worker, you know?
*  So I just, I can connect with somebody better that way.
*  And just like Lance, Nate said he was hopeful, not just about the idea of Trump,
*  but some of the specifics.
*  That he would turn the US around.
*  It's cliche, but make it great again.
*  Trade in particular.
*  There's a lot of people going broke, but yet we're bringing in beef from other countries.
*  What sense does that make?
*  So they both bought into the original promise of the Trump presidency, but the
*  impact of those trade policies, that's where they really started to diverge.
*  I think it was like taking medicine.
*  It doesn't taste good.
*  And at first it might hurt you a little bit, but the after-effects, if he would
*  have been able to keep going on, I think it would have made a hell of a difference.
*  I think, you know, Trump had these great ideas and we were all willing to, as
*  Nathan said, take the medicine and hopefully then it would get better.
*  And it cost us and I mean, depending on the size of your operation, it was extremely
*  painful. So there's a difference there when you look at the scope of things.
*  Equipment, equipment got higher priced, fertilizer got higher priced.
*  And would that be the same for you, Nate?
*  Sorry, I just, you nodded.
*  You said yes.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  And so your bottom line in a lot of ways was tougher at that time.
*  Oh, definitely.
*  Yeah.
*  Definitely.
*  And that was the medicine.
*  Yeah.
*  And so.
*  But that, that wasn't Trump's fault.
*  That wasn't, you know, that wasn't a politician's fault.
*  That was just big business doing what they want to.
*  It was policy.
*  That was, I mean, not necessarily Trump's fault, but it was under his watch.
*  So the thing to know here is that Lance's farm is actually a lot bigger than Nate's.
*  And you hear Lance very politely point out that fact.
*  It meant that he took a bigger hit during the Trump years than Nate did.
*  And so while that was a huge factor in driving Lance away from Trump, Nate came
*  away feeling differently.
*  Did you ever question your support for Trump in that medicine era when things
*  were a little bit difficult?
*  No, I didn't.
*  How come?
*  I just, I believed in him.
*  So your, your trust in him never really faltered.
*  No, it didn't.
*  No.
*  And so these two friends entered 2024 on very different sides of
*  the Republican primary equation.
*  Nate, heading into this 2024 cycle, are you thinking of going with Trump again?
*  I am.
*  Just for the, for the reason I liked what he did before and I liked the way he talks.
*  I like, I'd like to give him another shot.
*  So how does Lance navigate that?
*  I mean, what is he saying to his friend who is pretty adamant that he is
*  likely to stick with Trump?
*  That's what I wanted to know too.
*  DeSantis is behind in the polls, right?
*  You're going to need to pull some people with your speech.
*  So what is your, like, how are you going to get Nate onto the DeSantis train?
*  Probably with a baseball bat.
*  I'm thinking, right, Nate, is it going to take that or what's a good
*  idea?
*  The first hit count.
*  All right.
*  Short of a baseball bat.
*  What should, but like, how are we, you know, like, what can you, what is there
*  anything he could say to you that would get you to vote for him in the caucus?
*  Or is there anything he could say?
*  No, no, I don't think so.
*  Like I said, I don't like politicians.
*  I think DeSantis is a politician.
*  I don't think Trump is.
*  That's, that's, that's my thoughts.
*  Can Trump still be not a politician?
*  He's been president.
*  He's been the head of the party.
*  He's got allies in all of the places.
*  It's one of those things.
*  It's kind of remarkable.
*  How is he still the outsider?
*  Just cause he.
*  Because he's that hated by the politicians.
*  You know, they keep saying that he doesn't have a chance.
*  He doesn't have a chance of getting elected and everything, but why do they
*  keep trying to impeach him?
*  Why do they keep trying to take his name off the ballot?
*  If, if, if he wasn't that much of a threat to them, why don't they just walk away from it?
*  Lance, I saw you shrug your shoulder when he said he's that hated.
*  Can you just give us your reaction to what Nate said about Trump?
*  Well, I think Nathan's right.
*  I think he's extremely hated.
*  And by people in both parties.
*  I mean, I don't, here's why I don't think that Trump will make it.
*  I could be wrong.
*  There's not a Democrat out there that will vote for him.
*  There's a very few independents that will vote for him.
*  And there's a lot of Republicans that won't vote for him because they're never Trumpers.
*  And so when you start doing the math, that's concerning to me.
*  The math to me doesn't show him winning a general election.
*  And so I've got to strategically think that through my mind, if he can do that, who can,
*  who's the next person that can?
*  And in my mind, that's DeSantis.
*  And it really captures actually a dynamic that's happening across the Republican party,
*  which is, and Lance is open about this.
*  He's thinking strategically, who can we find who can win?
*  He's thinking all these people, they hate Donald Trump.
*  He's polarizing.
*  And that's the kind of candidate who might lose in November.
*  He's being deeply pragmatic.
*  This is, this is the classic head versus heart argument.
*  And as you're sitting in the room, you're watching Nate sit there and Nate, Nate is
*  all heart in this debate.
*  You know, he may be hated.
*  And I think that's also a good thing though, because, you know, I'm sure there's a lot
*  of people out there that hate me, but there's a lot of people that respect me though,
*  also.
*  So.
*  He's basically like, and having people hate Donald Trump, that's a selling point.
*  But Lance wasn't just making an electoral argument.
*  He was also saying, even if Trump wins, all these people that hate him, they're going
*  to make him less effective.
*  You look back at the history on things and Trump lost a lot of seats in the House and
*  the Senate Republican side, and he's going to need all of that to get anything done.
*  So I don't know if he can recapture that in that first two years.
*  I mean, if he can, it'd be beneficial to him, but I'm going to be very concerned about
*  that. He's, he's said a lot of things to a lot of legislators and governors.
*  He's, he's put our governor down just because she didn't support him.
*  And another thing that I fear is retribution.
*  How much of that's going to come into play with his first two years.
*  And not that I blame the guy, he's got a lot of people have done him wrong.
*  I'd want to get even with them as well.
*  But if we take that out and really look at what we need in the country, we need
*  leadership.
*  We need somebody that's going to get something done.
*  We need somebody that's not a blowhard.
*  And I'm not saying that Donald Trump's a blowhard.
*  I'm just saying we just need somebody that's going to do what they say they're going to
*  do.
*  And I fear that there's going to be so much resistance that it's going to play
*  havoc on any kind of results.
*  So that's, that's going to be one of the biggest reasons I went all in on the
*  CNS.
*  And how does Nate respond to all of this?
*  I mean, it's hard to quote a shrug, but he basically says, I'm still a Trump guy.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Well, I totally agree.
*  But we need somebody that the other countries are going to respect or fear.
*  And Trump has that.
*  And it goes back to what I said before, we got to start standing up for ourselves.
*  And I think he can do that better for us.
*  I mean, what's your reaction when Lance says that strategically, you know, the
*  DeSantis is a better pick.
*  What do you think?
*  Or strategy.
*  I don't know.
*  There's a lot of good points and it's hard for me to explain.
*  So Nate, it seems, remains essentially immune to this pitch from Lance.
*  Right.
*  Lance, as he's going through this process, he even diagnoses at one point
*  what he thinks is going on.
*  Well, Nathan, if I can say that, I'm just going to say it.
*  I think that, and I respect this, I think that you feel like Trump is owed
*  that second term because it was taken from him and he needs to get in there
*  and be able to finish what he started.
*  And I think that I'm thinking about this more strategically.
*  So I don't necessarily disagree with Nathan's thoughts.
*  Okay.
*  But I'm thinking strategically more in a business sense.
*  So I think maybe is that the dividing line?
*  I don't know.
*  What do you think?
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, we disagree on a lot of stuff.
*  And at the end of the day, we're still friends.
*  But even in this one conversation, there's a little bit of surprise.
*  I guess one of the questions is like, are you definitely showing up at a caucus
*  for him next Monday?
*  It might be negative five degrees.
*  If I wanted to go to a caucus, I would.
*  But will you?
*  I never have.
*  And that's that Nate is a decided Trump voter.
*  But even at the end of this long conversation, it wasn't clear for sure
*  that he was going to show up on Monday and caucus for Donald Trump.
*  Fascinating.
*  And that's really one of the questions that remains in this election is do
*  people who like Trump, who haven't caucused before, do they show up?
*  Hmm.
*  And so if at this late date, there's any uncertainty about the
*  results, it's because of that.
*  But let's presume that things do turn out the way that the polls anticipate
*  that they will, which is that Trump will prevail in the Iowa caucuses.
*  How is Lance, no doubt a bit crestfallen by his inability to convert his friend
*  Nate, how is Lance thinking about the prospect of Trump prevailing in Iowa?
*  I asked him about that.
*  Let's say that Nate's right.
*  And this is what polling shows too, which is that Trump is, is the
*  likelier winner in Iowa.
*  How are you going to feel if he ends up being your party's nominee?
*  Well, I'll have some disappointment for sure.
*  I mean, who wouldn't, right?
*  But I think that that disappointment needs to stop right there.
*  He says if Trump wins the Iowa caucuses, he'd be not particularly happy about it.
*  But I would definitely support Trump rather than Biden.
*  When it comes to the general election, he'd vote for him again, even if a bit begrudgingly.
*  And how would it feel to find yourself back in the voting booth, voting
*  for Trump one more time?
*  It's kind of like rats.
*  There's some disappointment there.
*  It's like the cows got out.
*  Dang it.
*  Now I got to go round them up again.
*  I don't know if that's a great analogy or not.
*  Another flat tire, we got to fix this.
*  And it just seems like it's another maintenance item, I guess.
*  So, all right, last question.
*  What kind of effect is all this having on your friendship?
*  None at all.
*  Yeah.
*  No, no, just another thing to argue about, right?
*  I'm going to get to go.
*  Told you so, Nathan.
*  I told you so.
*  So, Shane, what Lance's experience with Nate, I think, demonstrates what your own
*  reporting has also found is that in 2024, Republicans in general, and really
*  DeSantis in particular, they basically may just have gotten their math wrong, right?
*  They misunderstood how many Republican voters were ever really available to them.
*  Yeah, Michael, if you look at polls, now I'm in Iowa, but I can also look at
*  national polling, Donald Trump is at 60%, 70% in a lot of these surveys.
*  That means that those bucket presumptions, they weren't quite right.
*  That the number of people in that soft Trump category, either they all decided
*  to go with Trump or they were diehards all along.
*  And so now on the eve of the Iowa caucuses, the reality is that there
*  seemed to be a lot more Nates than Lances.
*  And that more than anything explains this lopsided state of the race as
*  Iowans get ready to caucus.
*  Well, Shane, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  A quick note, we'll be back to analyze the results of the Iowa caucuses next
*  week after the holiday, but on Monday, you can get caucus day coverage from
*  our colleagues over at the run-up.
*  They'll have a special episode with more about the campaign strategies,
*  get out the vote efforts and about what Iowa voters are thinking.
*  You can look for the run-up and that special episode wherever you listen.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to another day.
*  The U S and its allies carried out military strikes against more than a
*  dozen targets controlled by the Houthi militia, an Iranian backed group in
*  Yemen that has for weeks been attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea in
*  protest of Israel's war against Hamas.
*  The U S led airstrikes against the Houthis who are allies of Hamas represents
*  an expansion of the war in the Middle East that president Biden has sought to
*  avoid since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th.
*  And Israel has a genocidal intent against the Palestinians in Gaza.
*  On Thursday, officials from South Africa made their case to the United Nations
*  top court that Israel's military bombardment and siege of Gaza has
*  demonstrated an intent to commit genocide against Palestinians, a claim
*  that Israel categorically denies.
*  The level of Israel's killing is so extensive that nowhere is safe in Gaza.
*  On the first day of a historic two day hearing, the South African officials
*  cited as evidence the words of Israeli officials, including defense minister
*  Yoav Galant, who said that after the October 7th attacks by Hamas, Israel
*  would impose a complete siege on Gaza because he said it was fighting
*  human animals.
*  Israel will present its defense today.
*  Decisions by the court known as the International Court of Justice are
*  binding, but there are few means of enforcement and a final ruling could
*  take years.
*  Today's episode was reported and produced by Rob Zipko and Carlos Prieto
*  with help from Luke Vanderplueck.
*  It was edited by Rachel Quester and Paige Cowitt with help from Ben Calhoun.

*  Powell and Will Reed and was engineered by Chris Wood.
