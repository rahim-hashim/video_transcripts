*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernu-C, and this is the Daily.
*  The great supply chain disruption caused by the pandemic is mostly over, but it's led
*  to a larger and more permanent change in the global economy.
*  Today, my colleague Peter Goodman reports from the forefront of that change, an industrial
*  park in Mexico, where companies from China are setting up shop.
*  It's Tuesday, February 21st.
*  Peter, we all remember that during the pandemic, we couldn't get our stuff.
*  Mattresses, couches were all stuck out at sea taking forever to get to us.
*  And as you explained to us on the show in October 2021, that was because the supply chain
*  was totally disrupted, and specifically that the factories in China were totally disrupted,
*  which really scrambled the entire shipping system across the Pacific that feeds everything
*  that Americans want to buy.
*  But now you've reported that there's been a big shift in all of this.
*  So what was it?
*  So the last time we talked, we were talking about giant container vessels that were stuck
*  floating off of large American ports for weeks and sometimes even months waiting their
*  turn to pull up to the dock.
*  That's largely gone.
*  At least it is on the big West Coast ports and Los Angeles and Long Beach.
*  There are trucks moving and picking up containers.
*  A lot of the shortages are gone.
*  Some prices which had spiked dramatically have plummeted and have returned largely to
*  pre-pandemic normal.
*  But meanwhile, something really significant has shifted.
*  The kind of globalization that we've all been accustomed to over decades has given
*  way to something much more regional.
*  And what does that mean, Peter?
*  Well, for decades, China was at the center of globalization.
*  The national companies went pouring into China.
*  We talked about the China price, which was code for the cheapest possible price.
*  This assumption that China, this country of 1.3, now 1.4 billion people, essentially has
*  a limitless supply of workers, eager for factory jobs streaming in from the countryside.
*  And that this was just an unbeatable combination along with investments into ports and other
*  infrastructure by the government and the build-up of the supply chain.
*  You could get everything in China to make just about any product that you could imagine from
*  top to bottom.
*  But since the pandemic, multinational companies have come to revisit this central faith in
*  China, I talked not that long ago to the CEO of Columbia Sportswear, this giant sportswear
*  company that's headquartered in Oregon, who said for years, as we invested in Asia, we
*  operated as if shipping was essentially free.
*  Shipping was cheap, it was reliable, and we don't feel that way anymore.
*  And now we're trying to figure out what comes next.
*  And what comes next for many companies is figuring out how to make their products closer
*  to their largest markets.
*  Right.
*  We're thinking that model because the pandemic showed how vulnerable the shipping system we
*  all relied on actually was.
*  Yeah, that's exactly right.
*  Companies are looking for alternatives to factories in China.
*  Now the biggest market is the United States.
*  And so this takes us to Mexico, which is an obvious place if you're looking for lower-wage
*  production and easier land transportation to the United States, just glance at the map,
*  end up in Mexico.
*  And I had heard in fact that as production shifts from China to Mexico, a lot of goods are
*  being moved by truck through the port of Laredo, Texas.
*  This is this border town that has for a long time been the busiest overland port in the
*  United States.
*  And so I go down to Laredo to see how this is playing out there.
*  And on my first morning there.
*  Buenos días a todos ustedes.
*  Thank you for joining us.
*  Gracias por ser buenos sofros.
*  I'm invited to a press conference at City Hall.
*  Just so much to be happy about.
*  For the mayor at the time, Pete Sines is celebrating a fact that in the most recent month,
*  in October, there are more goods crossing the border at Laredo than there are goods coming
*  into the ports of LA and Long Beach.
*  Wow, incredible.
*  Yeah, it was amazing.
*  And of course, the expectation there is that it's going to increase international
*  commerce.
*  For everyone, I've even heard the word tsunami of commerce trade.
*  And the mayor is talking about the need to work with governments on the other side of
*  the Rio Grande in Mexico to make sure there's enough infrastructure to handle the flow of
*  all these goods.
*  So bienvenido y esperamos a escucharte.
*  And he's invited to delegation from one of those border states, the state of Nueva
*  La Yon.
*  Very good.
*  Buenos días a todos ustedes.
*  Un privilegio.
*  Está recorando.
*  And the officials from Nueva La Yon play this promotional video touting the merits of investing
*  in their state.
*  En 1991, Se inauguró a Puerto Colombia.
*  In the video, they're saying that Nueva La Yon is already getting something like half
*  of all the foreign investment that's coming to Mexico.
*  They're talking about how they're upgrading the highways and how there are only a two-hour
*  drive from the border.
*  La modernización del Puerto Colombia, ara de este un joble, logístico, internacional
*  de nivel mundial.
*  And after this video was over and the press conference was done, I approached this economics
*  minister who had made this presentation and I asked him, well, do you think that this
*  trend, this trend where companies are shifting production from China to Mexico?
*  Well that last after shipping rates returned to normal after the pandemic is behind us.
*  And he told me something that I found just astonishing.
*  He said, listen.
*  We've got Chinese companies that are setting up aggressively.
*  We've got a whole industrial park where there's 28 different Chinese companies that are now
*  sinking billions of dollars into factories in Nueva La Yon to serve the American market
*  and he said, you should come down and take a look and I was immediately intrigued.
*  Right, because for so long, Chinese companies have been making all of their products inside
*  China.
*  Yeah, that's exactly right.
*  And I went down there just a couple of weeks later.
*  What do you find when you get there?
*  Well I landed Monterey, the capital of Nueva La Yon, which is this boom town.
*  There are all these glittering new shopping malls full of luxury goods outlets.
*  There are some lovely hotels with interesting modern architecture.
*  There's fine dining and very clean streets.
*  Heck to Monterey, which is known as Mexico's MIT, is based here along with some other prestigious
*  universities that are turning out engineering graduates and that are looking to boost the
*  Mexican supply chain.
*  But what I really wanted to do was go see what was happening out at these industrial parks
*  where companies were setting up factories.
*  And so by getting a car, drive for about an hour north of Monterey, the city gives way
*  to a bunch of ranches, villages, then just unbroken desert dotted by cactus and at a very
*  kind of blank spot in the map.
*  Suddenly there's this enormous construction zone, lots of heavy equipment.
*  There's a gate marking the entrance to the Halfouson industrial park where these 28
*  Chinese companies are erecting factories somewhere already producing, most are still breaking
*  ground.
*  And I'm introduced to a guy named Bill Chan, who is the head of the Mexico subsidiary for
*  a Chinese furniture maker called Manuah.
*  And he tells me the story of how his company adapts to the changes in the global economy
*  by setting up a $300 million factory right there in Mexico.
*  So what is the story with this company?
*  And how does Bill Chan talk about their decision to set up in Mexico?
*  So Manuah is really a classic Chinese export story.
*  Founded in Hong Kong in 1992, Manuah has been a dedicated producer of sofas, mattresses,
*  they start with a bunch of factories in China throughout the country from the southern
*  boom town of Shenzhen to the northern city of Tianjin.
*  They make really cheap lazy boy like reclining sofas.
*  Manuah puts out 1.32 million sets of sofas a year or more than 3,600 sets of sofas a day,
*  providing quality and comfortable furniture to over 4,000 families a day.
*  They export this stuff all over the world, but the US is their most important market.
*  They sell online merchants like Wayfair, wholesalers, various retail channels.
*  In a year's a heck, we will strive to build Manuah into a top international furniture center
*  and steer the advancement of global furniture industry.
*  And you have to remember that even before the pandemic, that model was disrupted by the trade war
*  started by President Trump, really from the minute he took office.
*  He starts off slapping punitive tariffs on Chinese goods across the board,
*  which makes it more expensive for Americans to purchase Chinese goods.
*  So long before the pandemic, Manuah is already searching out alternative places to make products for the American market.
*  This prompts the company to buy a factory in Thailand.
*  They build a new factory in Vietnam near Ho Chi Minh City.
*  They even purchased a factory in Ukraine, though they had to abandon that once Russia invaded.
*  And they were using these factories outside of China to ship goods to the American market
*  to get out from under the Trump tariffs.
*  Well, then the pandemic comes and disrupts shipping across the Pacific.
*  So whether you're in Thailand or Vietnam or China no longer matters.
*  You're on the wrong side of the Pacific Ocean.
*  And they decide they need to get onto the right side of the Pacific Ocean.
*  And that leads them to start exploring the possibility of opening a factory in Mexico.
*  So first comes the trade war prompting them to move production to Southeast Asia.
*  But then comes the pandemic, which prompts them to move to, as you said, the right side of the Pacific.
*  And they turn to Mexico.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  And you know, there are a bunch of factors that bring them to Mexico.
*  Proximity is the primary consideration.
*  But you know, they could set up in the United States, presumably.
*  But the US has labor shortages.
*  And the US has much higher wages than they're accustomed to paying in China and Southeast Asia.
*  Mexico, the wages are much closer to prevailing wages in Asia.
*  And when they factor in the savings on transportation,
*  they think they can get pretty close to the overall cost of making a sofa and delivering it to a customer.
*  You know, the same equation they're looking at in Asia.
*  And not least, Mexico is part of a free trade zone with the United States and Canada.
*  Right.
*  And if they're able to make their products in Mexico and qualify for the made in Mexico label,
*  they can ship them to the rest of North America duty free.
*  And so for all of those reasons,
*  Manwai is looking very seriously at Mexico.
*  Bill Chan reaches out to one of the marketing people at this industrial park.
*  He finds outside of Monterey the one I'm visiting.
*  They're texting on WeChat, the Chinese social media platform.
*  He's asking, you know, basic questions like,
*  can we start constructing immediately?
*  Yes.
*  How are the roads?
*  They're not that great, but they're getting better.
*  Are there any real Chinese restaurants around?
*  Absolutely not.
*  Then he is really feeling a sense of urgency to make this happen because they've got just
*  scores of containers that are stuck in these floating traffic jams.
*  They cannot get their product from Asia to the United States.
*  So Chan has never set foot in Mexico.
*  He doesn't even visit this industrial park,
*  but he takes some reassurance from the fact that 27 of the 28 parcels in the first phase of
*  this industrial park are already spoken for.
*  And there are some companies he recognizes.
*  And without even setting foot in Mexico, he signs a letter of commitment
*  to build a $300 million factory just a couple of weeks after he starts talking
*  to the people in Mexico.
*  And he signs the letter of commitment at Shanghai's Pudong Airport
*  before he boards a flight to San Francisco on his way to Monterey,
*  leaving his wife and children behind in China.
*  So he moves really fast to get in on this?
*  Yeah.
*  He just shrugged when he's telling me this.
*  He said, look, we have to move fast.
*  Can we make our decisions and we execute?
*  I mean, they are intent on figuring out how to continue selling into the US market.
*  Never mind the pandemic disruption, the trade war, whatever the politicians are saying,
*  this large Chinese company is simply not walking away from the largest consumer market on Earth.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Peter, there are all of these Chinese companies setting up shops south of the border
*  in New Aviliune, Mexico. How is it going so far?
*  Well, it's too early to know how it's going because lots of stuff has to happen.
*  But you know, there's a lot of enthusiasts.
*  In Mexico, there's a lot of hope that all this investment is going to translate into jobs,
*  potentially at higher wages as there's greater demand and competition for workers.
*  For American consumers, this could be a way to get out from under these product shortages and
*  disruptions that we've seen through the pandemic, the trade war. There is some talk that
*  there could be slightly higher prices for some things, but for some goods, there could actually be
*  lower prices because a lot of people argue that after you factoring the cost of transportation,
*  the cost of labor are more or less the same in many areas of Mexico and China.
*  And so there could be savings. But the most important reason this might be good for the US is because
*  trade within the region tends to produce more job opportunities at home. You know, we've seen
*  hollowing out of the industrial base during the era of China-centric globalization in manufacturing
*  communities in the US. Well, the data shows that when we buy a good that's made in Mexico,
*  roughly 40% of the value of that good is actually produced in the United States by American workers.
*  The figure for China is something closer to 4%, and of course, Chinese state policy
*  is aimed at driving that as close to zero as possible, as China aims for self-sufficiency.
*  So, again, when we trade within the region, we're effectively creating demand for American-made goods.
*  So you're saying that even though these factories are not in the US, it could still stimulate
*  US manufacturers because products would go to supply those factories in Mexico.
*  Yeah, that's right. I mean, the supply chains in the US and Mexico and Canada are increasingly
*  intertwined. So if you look at a car that might be assembled in Mexico, it draws on parts and
*  components made across the US. There are goods that cross the border multiple times back and forth
*  before a final product is assembled. So in other words, things made in Mexico are also kind of
*  made in America in a way that they just wouldn't be if they were made in China. Yeah, that's well put.
*  You know, the other way in which it could be good for the US and for Mexico is all of our tensions
*  around the border involving immigration could be eased somewhat if Mexico develops and has more
*  decent-paying jobs. So whatever your feelings are about immigration for Mexico and Central America,
*  it does seem like a positive if there are more decent-paying jobs in Mexico.
*  Right. So if the economy in Mexico is booming, migrants might stop in Mexico instead of coming
*  across the US border. Yeah, that's exactly right. And instead of arguing over border and
*  immigration policy, we can be celebrating economic growth that ideally benefits the whole region.
*  And what about these Chinese companies? I mean, we know it makes a certain kind of sense for them
*  on paper, right? Like, that's why they're coming to Mexico. But now that the rubber is really starting
*  to hit the road, how's it going for these companies? Well, it's challenging. And there are reasons
*  to wonder how Chinese companies will adapt. The first thing that Chinese companies have to deal with
*  is the reality that the supply chain in Mexico is just nowhere as abundant or sophisticated as it is
*  at home in China. So they're still having to bring in a lot of the key components, a parallel
*  company, years from bringing in fabric from China. I talked to one of the other 28 companies that
*  industrial park is a big wheel manufacturer. They have to bring in aluminum ingots from Dubai. I
*  mean, that's not something they can buy in Mexico. So that will be a long-term challenge. The more
*  immediate challenge is labor. They're operating in a place where there are labor unions. I mean,
*  labor unions are very active in Mexico. You know, Chinese companies at home are accustomed to
*  operating in a place where unions are effectively banned. And there's this assumption, even if it's
*  changed over time in reality, that you'll never run out of workers. That if you mistreat workers
*  and they go somewhere else, there'll be some new people showing up from the countryside,
*  desperately in search of a job and willing to work at low pay. Well, in Mexico, and take just
*  Nueva Laone, for example, where the unemployment rate is around 3.5%. They're going to be in fierce
*  competition with European companies, American companies, other Latin American companies for labor.
*  And there's also a gap between the expectations of the people on the ground and their bosses in China.
*  I had some conversations with Chinese executives in Mexico. He said, look, we understand. We have to do
*  things like, you know, throw a barbecue for the workers. Think about offering them buses to help
*  them get from their homes to the factory, but we're answering to bosses in China who are like, well,
*  why are we paying for this stuff? What's up with this line item? We're there to try to cut costs.
*  So that's attention going forward for sure. But this isn't just about barbecues and free shuttle
*  buses, right? Like, given the labor dynamics you're describing here, I'm assuming that the relatively
*  low wages these companies were counting on when they set their sights on Mexico in the first place
*  may not last for long. Like, the workers could very easily demand more knowing how much China needs
*  them. Yeah, that's right. I mean, union power plus low unemployment is a prescription for higher
*  wages. And a lot of these Chinese companies are simply not accustomed to having to compete with
*  other employers to higher workers and to retain workers. And they're going to have to distinguish
*  themselves as good employers, or they're simply going to have a tough time getting the people they
*  need. Monois needs 6,000 workers in a place with 3.5% unemployment to fill out this giant factory
*  that's now building for $300 million. So it sounds like while this could be really good for China,
*  because this could be a way that they hang onto their giant market in the US,
*  there are also profound risks. Because of this huge X factor you're describing, you know,
*  whether they'll be able to work with a completely different labor market or not.
*  Yeah, that's true. But I guess I would flip that and say the status quo has risks and the model
*  has changed. I mean, take Walmart, the world's largest retailer, 20 years ago, if you were a factory
*  trying to sell a product to Walmart to put on their shelves and you weren't making it in China,
*  they pretty much didn't want to talk to you because that was an indication that you weren't
*  producing at the lowest possible cost. Well, now, I mean, I was just down in Bentonville,
*  Arkansas, which is Walmart's headquarters just last week. And I met with a representative
*  from a bunch of factories in China that's now exploring alternative factories elsewhere.
*  And he's been going to see Walmart for 20 years to pitch them on products. And he told me that now,
*  if you're only relying on Chinese factories, that's the end of the meeting with Walmart. Now,
*  they are so insistent that there'd be greater diversity of supplies that you better have an
*  option where, if you're selling to the United States, you've got a factory in Mexico or maybe
*  Central America. I mean, regionalization is now being driven by the world's largest retail operations.
*  Interesting. So Walmart is trying to insulate itself from all of the vulnerabilities of manufacturing
*  in China, the trade war stuff and the supply chain stuff. And basically forcing these companies to
*  embrace this model of regionalization because it's fundamentally in Walmart's interest. Exactly.
*  Peter, given all of that, is China going to remain the dominant manufacturer in the world that
*  it has been for so many years? Yeah, it probably will for several years for the simple reason that
*  there's nothing else like China on earth. I mean, in terms of the scale, in terms of the intensity
*  of the supply chain, it's still really the only place where you can make a huge range of industrial
*  goods from furniture to clothing to higher value stuff like electronics, where you have all the
*  components and the raw materials right there. I mean, China is the world's second largest economy.
*  China can drive an enormous amount of economic growth, simply making stuff for its own 1.4 billion
*  and China will continue to do that as well as continue to be an export powerhouse. And so
*  anybody writing an obituary for globalization is way off base. We're going to continue to trade.
*  We're going to continue to look to different parts of the globe for specialties and countries
*  will still be defined by their various competitive advantages. But it is the end of the way in which
*  we've conceived of globalization where China is the factory floor to the world.
*  We've come out of this experience of the pandemic combined with the trade war with a profound
*  understanding that there are risks that we used to pretend weren't there at all. And that
*  argues for all multinational companies, not just Chinese multinational companies,
*  all multinational companies, keeping their production close to their ultimate markets.
*  We now have industrial policy in the United States designed to ensure that things like advanced
*  computer chips can be made in the US, that electric vehicles and batteries can be made in the US.
*  And this stuff involves erecting plants that cost billions of dollars in places like the US
*  Mexico. China will still be an incredibly significant place for manufacturing, but there will be
*  others and they will be driven by an emphasis on regionalization and an appreciation of the value
*  of making your goods closer to where you're actually selling them.
*  And that is a fundamental shift in the way the entire global economy works.
*  Yeah, big time. I mean, it's really like the world map is being redrawn in real time.
*  Peter, thank you. Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. It was one year ago this week
*  that we spoke on the telephone with the president. It was very late in night and washing
*  in her early morning here in Kiev. On Monday, President Joe Biden made a surprise visit to
*  Kiev to meet with Ukrainian president Vladimir Zelensky. And I don't know they remember what you
*  said to me, but you said and I quote, gather the leaders of the world, ask them to support Ukraine.
*  Biden wrote 10 hours by train from the Polish border. The first time he had traveled to Ukraine since
*  Russia invaded a year ago. The Americans stand with you and the world stands with you.
*  Kiev has captured a part of my heart, I must say.
*  He praised Ukraine's resilience and announced an additional $500 million in U.S. military aid.
*  And he criticized Russia's president Vladimir Putin, who's expected to make a speech of his own
*  on Tuesday in Moscow. We know that there'll be very difficult days and weeks and years ahead,
*  but Russia's aim was to wipe Ukraine off the map. Putin's war conquest is failing.
*  And another earthquake hit Turkey in Syria on Monday. The 6.3 magnitude quake struck near
*  Turkey's Hattay province, one of the areas most devastated by the earthquakes that struck earlier
*  this month. Those quakes killed more than 46,000 people. Finally, over the weekend, Jimmy Carter,
*  the 39th president of the United States, entered hospice care. He served from 1977 to 1981,
*  but lost reelection after a sour economy and an American hostage crisis in Iran.
*  At 98, Carter is the longest living president in American history.
