*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Maburo.
*  This is Adelaide.
*  Today, for the past three years, the United States has relied on an emergency health
*  rule to solve its immigration problems at the U.S. Mexico border.
*  By the end of the week, that rule will expire.
*  My colleague, Miriam Jordan, has been reporting on what that will mean for those on both sides
*  of the border.
*  It's Tuesday, May 9.
*  Miriam, I wonder if you can walk us through precisely what's happening at the border
*  on Thursday.
*  Well, at 11.59 pm Eastern time, the Biden administration is lifting an emergency health
*  rule that has been used to prevent hundreds of thousands of migrants, many of them seeking
*  asylum from entering the United States.
*  That rule is called Title 42.
*  Right, and we've talked about Title 42 a lot on this show, but just explain where Title
*  42 comes from and what exactly it has done.
*  Well, Title 42 was imposed three years ago by President Trump under the premise of preventing
*  the spread of COVID-19 to the American public.
*  But it was essentially used as a border control tool because, quite simply, it has allowed
*  U.S. border officials to very quickly turn away most migrants who show up trying to enter
*  the United States.
*  No hearing, no chance to ask for asylum, nothing.
*  They're literally expelled within minutes.
*  Which is not the normal situation.
*  Exactly.
*  Let's replace the previous system that critics sometimes labeled catch and release because
*  migrants were able to turn themselves into border patrol agents, say that they wanted
*  asylum, and then were allowed to wait in the United States for the outcome of their immigration
*  case for years.
*  And they might never leave.
*  Right, it was a system whereby in the crudest possible terms, if you came to the U.S.
*  and asked for asylum, it was a way of staying in the U.S. for quite some time.
*  Yes, that is correct.
*  A asylum doesn't happen overnight.
*  Applicants have to wait for years for their cases to resolve in court.
*  The reality on the ground that that system generated became very frustrating, particularly
*  to Republicans and the administration of Donald Trump.
*  And that triggered a major change in policy.
*  And that policy change was to block asylum seekers from entering the United States using
*  Title 42 and the health emergency rationale of the pandemic.
*  Correct.
*  You know, people from many countries who touch U.S. soil and turn themselves into the
*  border patrol or were apprehended by agents were now swiftly expelled back to Mexico or
*  placed on deportation flights back to their home countries.
*  And obviously the pandemic emergency has ended, so there's no justification for keeping
*  this policy in place.
*  Miriam, what does it look like at the border right now as this emergency policy Title 42
*  that really served as a message to those seeking asylum that they shouldn't come to the
*  border because the old rules weren't going to apply?
*  What does it look like as that now ends?
*  Well, I guess it's mayhem.
*  Tonight, the scenes of pure desperation growing on the border waves a migrant surging across
*  the Rio Grande River into the U.S.
*  We've seen a substantial increase in the number of migrants trying to cross into the United
*  States ahead of this policy shift.
*  A large crowd of migrants are gathering at the U.S. Southern border with Mexico.
*  They're waiting to be apprehended.
*  And we've also seen very large numbers of migrants amassing in border cities on the
*  Mexican side.
*  Migrants grasping for what food and supplies they can get through the border wall in El Paso
*  with hopes of crossing after the policy sun sets.
*  The new group of migrants are doing what they can to stay warm as they wait for what
*  is sometimes hours to be processed.
*  There's confusion.
*  Some people think it will become more difficult to enter the U.S. so they want to come as soon
*  as possible before 11.59 pm on Thursday.
*  Many others think it's going to become easier afterwards.
*  Border towns are already stretched El Paso declaring a state of emergency saying 1300
*  50 migrants arrive there every day already.
*  Outside a church in downtown El Paso last week, there are about 2,000 migrants who had
*  recently managed to cross the border, sleeping on the sidewalk, on these collapsed cardboard
*  boxes.
*  You know, some children were begging.
*  Migrants were trying to figure out how they were going to get to their destinations across
*  the country.
*  It was really sad.
*  This young woman who came to the U.S. saying there are many more coming trying to escape
*  violence and economic collapse back home.
*  So some of the migrants who are now massing at the border think that the end of Title
*  42 means it's going to be harder to get into the U.S. for them.
*  Others think when Title 42 expires it's going to be easier.
*  So which side of this argument is right?
*  It's likely to get harder because the Biden administration sees the end of Title 42 as
*  an opportunity to make some pretty significant changes to how a silent works.
*  And those changes could mean but large numbers of migrants seeking asylum will no longer
*  be able to do so at the border.
*  And the reason the Biden administration wants to do that is really because we have an unprecedented
*  number of people from around the world seeking entry into the United States.
*  Its Russians trying to evade conscription as the war with Ukraine rages.
*  Afghans trying to escape the Taliban.
*  It's Venezuela's Haitians, Cubans, Colombians, Nicaraguan's who are coming from countries
*  whose economies have been ravaged by COVID.
*  And all those people that you just described, they're coming through Mexico, correct?
*  And almost all of them see this previous system of asylum in the U.S. the one that was
*  in place before Title 42 as their best path into the United States.
*  Right.
*  And the reality is that long before Title 42 was put in place, the system was just not
*  equipped to handle this number of people applying for asylum.
*  The system has been completely buckling.
*  So many people apply that there's often a five year backlog until a case comes to completion.
*  It's in part because it's not just people who qualify for asylum applying for it.
*  They're also people taking advantage of the system.
*  People who know they won't qualify still apply because they know that they can stay in
*  the country at least for the number of years it takes for their case to move through the
*  system.
*  And the result of all this is that the system doesn't function as a working immigration
*  policy.
*  So what exactly is the Biden administration's plan now that Title 42 is going away to change
*  the way asylum works and to avoid this crush of people at the border?
*  Well, actually, the Biden administration has come up with two ways to try to discourage
*  people from coming to the U.S. Mexico border.
*  The first is legal pathways for people to avoid making their journey altogether.
*  And the second is actually making it harder for them to get in if they come to the border.
*  Okay.
*  Let's start with the first, the idea of new legal pathways that might prevent people
*  from making this dangerous track to the U.S. Mexico border.
*  What is that plan?
*  Well, it's a patchwork of programs.
*  The first one called humanitarian parole enables people from four countries, including Venezuela,
*  Haiti, Cuba, and Nicaragua, to fly directly to the U.S. rather than come to the border,
*  they've decided they have a financial sponsor in the United States that commits to receiving
*  them.
*  Interest.
*  That alleviates pressure from the border.
*  Secondly, the administration recently announced that it will be setting up regional centers
*  for people to apply for refugee status in Colombia, Guatemala, and potentially other countries.
*  Again, that would prevent people from coming all the way
*  to the border.
*  Right.
*  In other words, seek your entry into the US
*  long before you get to the US-Mexico border.
*  Precisely.
*  And lastly, the administration unveiled a mobile app
*  that enables migrants who are in Mexico
*  to apply for an appointment for an interview
*  with an immigration officer at the border.
*  Many of these migrants would normally come to the border
*  and turn themselves in, but the app is designed
*  to create some order in the process,
*  even if they're already in Mexico,
*  having left their countries in South America or Asia.
*  Got it.
*  So the message embedded in all three of these plans is,
*  there are ways of trying to get into the country
*  that don't require you to come to the border,
*  and please don't come to the border.
*  Exactly.
*  But for migrants who are trying to reach the US,
*  there are problems with all of these alternatives.
*  Such as?
*  Well, the problem with the humanitarian parole program
*  is that many of these migrants don't have family or friends
*  with means in the United States
*  to take responsibility for supporting them.
*  The regional centers haven't yet been established,
*  and it's not clear when they would be up and running.
*  The mobile app has problems.
*  It offers a very limited number of appointments.
*  Those appointments fill up very quickly, almost instantly,
*  and the app favors people who have good internet connection.
*  I've talked to migrants who say that it crashes
*  when they finally get on,
*  or it doesn't accept the information they upload.
*  So some of these alternative means of applying
*  to come to the US are either a work in progress
*  or not in place really at all at this point.
*  Right.
*  But the main problem the Biden administration
*  is facing right now is that on top of all that,
*  there are already tens of thousands of people
*  amassed on the Mexican side of the border,
*  and they're still going to try to get in
*  in a way that the government really doesn't want them to try.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Miriam, what's going to happen to all these people
*  who have done with the US government
*  doesn't want them to do,
*  which has come to the border seeking asylum?
*  Right.
*  So that brings us to the second set of rules
*  that will go into effect.
*  The first set was designed to discourage people
*  from coming to the border altogether.
*  The second set is designed to make it harder
*  to get in if you come to the border.
*  And make it harder once you're at the border.
*  So when Title 42 lifts to be eligible for asylum
*  in the United States,
*  if you pass through another country to arrive here,
*  such as Mexico, you must have applied for asylum
*  in that other country first and been denied there.
*  So to apply for asylum in the US going forward,
*  an applicant has to have been denied asylum
*  in another country.
*  So for someone coming from, say Guatemala, for example,
*  Mexico, which is a stop along the way
*  from Guatemala to the US,
*  would have had to deny them asylum.
*  And the US cannot be the first place
*  that this person tries to immigrate.
*  Right.
*  And so when Title 42 goes away,
*  and you arrive at the US border and request asylum,
*  the key question to determine whether you're eligible
*  to enter the country is going to be,
*  have you applied for asylum in another country
*  on the way here like you're supposed to?
*  And if you haven't,
*  if everything goes according to this new plan,
*  you would be arrested, processed, and quickly deported.
*  So by making it so hard to ever get to the point
*  where you can apply for asylum,
*  by creating all these hoops to jump through,
*  it would really seem like the Biden administration
*  in this moment is going a long way
*  toward effectively eliminating asylum.
*  Is that right?
*  Well, it may look that way,
*  but there are some very notable exceptions
*  that mean that is not the case.
*  And what are those?
*  For one, Mexicans who come to the border
*  do not pass through another country
*  on their way to the United States.
*  And there are more than 200,000 internally displaced Mexicans
*  who would like to seek asylum in the United States
*  according to independent estimates.
*  Got to say this policy won't really apply to them.
*  Correct.
*  Then there are families with young children
*  under the Biden administration.
*  The United States does not detain families.
*  It typically allows them into the country
*  after processing them at the border.
*  The reason for that is that technically,
*  kids aren't supposed to be detained
*  for more than a few days.
*  And every time a president has tried to find
*  an alternative other than just letting families in,
*  whether it be separating parents and kids,
*  or detaining them all together,
*  it's drawn ferocious criticism.
*  Right.
*  As President Trump learned when he tried to separate
*  migrant families, children from their parents.
*  Correct.
*  So if a family shows up at the border,
*  the US is very likely to allow them into the country
*  after processing them.
*  And finally, there's one more exception,
*  individuals who come from countries
*  with which the United States does not have good relations,
*  such as Russia, making it almost impossible
*  to put them on deportation planes
*  back to where they came from.
*  Got it.
*  So Miriam, in all, how many people are we talking about
*  who would fit into one of these categories of exceptions
*  to the Biden administration's plan
*  to discourage people from coming to the border
*  to seek asylum?
*  Well, altogether, we could have hundreds of thousands
*  of people who are still led in,
*  which is problematic to the Biden administration's intentions
*  because it sends a mixed message to potential migrants.
*  Right.
*  The message being, on the one hand, we're telling you,
*  don't come to the border, don't come to the border,
*  don't come to the border.
*  On the other hand, we're saying, well, you can come to the border
*  and you can come to the border and that gets messy.
*  Exactly.
*  And let's not forget that there's a very sophisticated
*  smuggling network out there that uses these mixed messages
*  to convince would be clients that entry to the United States
*  is virtually guaranteed.
*  So Miriam, this conversation is ending in a place
*  I hadn't quite expected it to
*  because we started this conversation with the Biden administration
*  to resolve to replace Title 42 with a new system
*  that discouraged people from heading to the US
*  Mexico border to seek asylum.
*  And yet, the first part of the plan is in various stages
*  of not quite readiness or a kind of buggy.
*  And therefore, people are still going to come to the border.
*  And then the second part has so many exceptions
*  that it won't do a ton of work to discourage all that many people.
*  So is this going to do what the Biden administration
*  hopes it's going to do, which is signal
*  that people don't come to the border?
*  Yeah, Michael, I think we're in this kind of strange position.
*  A lot of advocates are very upset about the new asylum restrictions.
*  They regard them as cruel and a violation of US commitment
*  to being a safe haven for those seeking refuge.
*  But the reality is that the nature of what the Biden administration
*  is seeking to do leaves plenty of confusion and hope.
*  So migrants will continue to come to the border
*  because they are aware that there is a chance
*  that they will make it into the country.
*  So long and short of this is that if the Biden administration
*  hoped that this new replacement for title 42 would end these painful scenes
*  of people massing at the border trying to get in, that is not what's likely
*  to happen anytime soon.
*  That's right, because there's so many people waiting on the other side
*  of the border as we speak to enter the United States.
*  And they're not going to turn around and retrace their journey
*  from Afghanistan or from Venezuela once they've gotten so close.
*  So Miriam, this doesn't really seem like a foolproof plan
*  from the Biden administration.
*  And I wonder why this is the best that it can do.
*  And I ask that very mindful that President Biden is now officially running
*  for reelection against Republicans, including Donald Trump,
*  who are very, very focused on the issue of the border.
*  Well, the Biden administration has been trying to use its executive authority
*  to address this intractable problem.
*  We have masses of people who want to come to the United States
*  to rebuild their lives.
*  But ultimately, any real solution has to come out of Congress
*  because our immigration system is broken.
*  We've had this policy for three years that's been used to sort of hold the line.
*  But, you know, Congress is responsible for immigration legislation.
*  And we know that immigration has been a political nonstarter
*  because the Republicans and Democrats are so polarized on this issue.
*  So what you end up with is a president with his hot potato in his hands
*  trying to come up with solutions.
*  And these solutions are a hodgepodge that no one is happy with
*  because ultimately, they aren't going to stop people from coming to the border.
*  Well, Miriam, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you so much for having me.
*  We'll do it back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Monday, after a two week civil trial,
*  a jury in Manhattan will now decide whether former president Donald Trump
*  is guilty of battery and defamation,
*  stemming from allegations that he raped a woman in the 1990s.
*  That woman, E. Jean Carroll,
*  accused Trump of sexually assaulting her in a department store dressing room.
*  If found libel, Trump may be forced to pay financial damages and retract statements
*  that he's made mocking both Carroll and her claims.
*  And officials tell the Washington Post that the gunman who killed eight people
*  at a mall in Texas over the weekend was briefly enlisted in the U.S. Army,
*  but was discharged over a mental health condition.
*  The shooter's motive remains unclear,
*  but police are examining online posts in which the shooter expressed hate
*  towards women and black people.
*  The rampage was the 199th mass shooting in the U.S.
*  since the start of the year.
