# Is the Future of Medicine Hidden in Ancient DNA?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CJ8H2VKAtU)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverdisy, and this is The Daily.
*  In a major new advance in science, DNA from Bronze Age skeletons is providing new clues
*  to modern-day medical mysteries.
*  Today, my colleague Carl Zimmer explains how a new field of science is changing the way
*  we think about treatments for devastating diseases.
*  It's Wednesday, January 31st.
*  So Carl, you are a science reporter, as our listeners will know, and you write about
*  evolution and the origins of life.
*  And you've recently written a story that really piqued my interest.
*  It was about a major new discovery in our understanding of ancient people.
*  And it's leading to some big advances, as I understand it, in modern medicine.
*  So tell me about it.
*  Well, scientists have been wondering about two big questions for a long time.
*  One of them is, why do we get sick?
*  The other question is, where do we come from?
*  And they seem like they should have two very different answers.
*  But now scientists are starting to realize maybe the two questions actually have the
*  same answer.
*  The same answer how, Carl?
*  Well, it's possible that in order to treat the diseases we have to deal with today,
*  diseases often that have no treatment yet, it may be necessary to go back thousands of years
*  and look at how our ancestors lived then.
*  What were the challenges they faced?
*  What was their health like?
*  What kind of genes did they carry?
*  And maybe we can then come back to the present and start to be able to make our own health
*  better.
*  And now researchers have just made some really big discoveries, both about human history
*  and about our diseases at the same time.
*  And this history actually lives inside of us right now in our own genes and has big
*  implications for our health.
*  Okay.
*  So two branches of science coming together, as you say, making some major new discoveries.
*  So tell me about this first field of science, Carl.
*  What's happening there?
*  Well, you know, once upon a time, if you wanted to study ancient life, you were pretty much
*  limited to fossils.
*  After an animal or person died, their body is decomposed.
*  And if you're lucky, their bones managed to survive in rock.
*  And then thousands or millions of years later, a paleontologist would come along and dig
*  those fossils out.
*  But now it is actually possible to dig up those bones and to drill a little sample out
*  of them and find some DNA still surviving in it.
*  So this actually gives you a glimpse into the molecular life of these ancient people
*  or ancient animals.
*  And it's amazing enough when scientists can get just a single gene out of a fossil that's
*  thousands and thousands of years old.
*  But actually, the science has come so far in recent years that it's been so far from
*  scientists to get a whole genome of an extinct species.
*  That is, every single gene, every stretch of DNA reconstructed pretty accurately.
*  Once you can look at the whole genome of some ancient organism, you are really starting
*  to get the big picture of how that thing lived.
*  And looking back at our own past, we can actually use this ancient DNA from fossils to figure
*  out some clues about our ancient relatives going back a couple hundred thousand years,
*  actually.
*  And this includes ancient relatives like Neanderthals, for example.
*  So now we can actually see an entire genome of Neanderthal.
*  But more recently, what's been really spectacular is actually how scientists have been able to
*  focus on the past 10,000 years.
*  And what we're talking about there is that time in history where hunter-gatherers started
*  to domesticate animals and plants and start to farm when you started to have the first
*  towns, when you started to have first large-scale societies.
*  And we can actually go now and see what the DNA of these people look like.
*  Actually, we can see thousands of people from this time period.
*  OK, so we're really getting a clearer picture of how groups of ancient peoples came to be
*  and live their lives many, many years ago.
*  But how specific is that picture?
*  Like, what does it look like?
*  What are some of the things we're learning, Carl?
*  We're learning about all sorts of things about these people's lives by looking at
*  their DNA.
*  I mean, some people today, they can drink milk and be fine with that.
*  And some people are lactose intolerant.
*  Well, we can actually look back at the DNA and say, who was lactose intolerant among
*  ancient farmers 8,000 years ago?
*  We can say that.
*  We can start to actually get clues about the color of the skin of people who lived 10,000
*  years ago.
*  We can figure out how societies were organized.
*  When you come across a burial with several skeletons in it, when they all have jewelry
*  on it, you can actually show genetically if they're related or not.
*  And that might tell you you're looking at, say, a royal family.
*  And on top of that, look at how these different groups of people with certain genetic markers
*  moved around, how they expanded from one place to another, how two populations might interbreed.
*  So there's an astonishing amount that you can learn now from ancient DNA.
*  So we're basically seeing the stories of different groups of people over time.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  And there are groups of people that we didn't really know much about before, people who
*  existed thousands of years ago who now we're realizing were actually really important to
*  the course of history.
*  And one of those was actually a group called the Yamnaya.
*  OK, Yamnaya.
*  That is not a group I am familiar with, not a household name.
*  Well, archaeologists have known about the Yamnaya to some extent for decades, but they
*  couldn't really say that much about them.
*  What has become clear now is that the Yamnaya were living, you know, maybe 6,000, 5,000
*  years ago.
*  They started out as farmers, but they actually gave up farming because they developed this
*  practice of herding cattle and sheep and goats, and they were incredibly successful at this.
*  And they were among the first horse riders.
*  They would use the horses and other livestock to haul wagons, and they would just go across
*  hundreds of thousands of miles of the steppe from the Ukraine all the way over to Central Asia,
*  to places like Kazakhstan.
*  They went from roaming around to exploding across Europe and Asia.
*  And when they showed up, they took over.
*  And you can see this actually when they arrive in Denmark, for example.
*  Scientists have looked very closely at the DNA in Denmark from skeletons over the past
*  10,000 years, and you can see that there's a group of farmers there with a certain kind
*  of ancestry, and then boom, the Yamnaya show up about 5,000 years ago.
*  That's it.
*  It's all Yamnaya.
*  So they showed up in northern Europe from Central Asia, and at some point became the
*  dominant population.
*  That's right.
*  We don't know exactly how that happened.
*  There are some very dark possibilities.
*  This could have been some kind of genocide, or maybe it wasn't such a violent transition.
*  Maybe it was a competition for land that took decades to play out.
*  But in any case, we know that the Yamnaya became the people of the region, and then
*  they became the ancestors of people in northern Europe today.
*  People today with northern European ancestry, they come from the Yamnaya.
*  And Carl, why are these people important?
*  Why are we talking about Yamnaya in the context of this genetic stuff?
*  Well, in addition to being really important to the course of history, they actually matter
*  to us today.
*  Because locked inside of their DNA 5,000 years ago are some really crucial secrets
*  about some of the most devastating diseases we suffer from today.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Carl, you said that this new science was showing us something important about these
*  Yamnaya people, and it had to do with disease, this little code locked inside their DNA.
*  Tell me about that.
*  So this brings us to the second field of science I was talking about, which is the basic question
*  of why we get sick.
*  We get these diseases, and they seem to have all sorts of just random symptoms.
*  But if you can understand their history, if you can understand their evolution,
*  maybe they're not as random as they seem.
*  Maybe by understanding their history, we're going to be able to treat them.
*  Okay, so this is these two fields of science coming together, like a kind of, you know,
*  scientific chocolate, peanut butter, Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.
*  But what's the process once they come together?
*  Like, how do you study disease in ancient people?
*  So on the one hand, you have some scientists who are looking at the DNA of living people
*  and finding different variations in their genes that put them at risk for certain diseases.
*  There are genes that can raise your risk for heart disease, for cancer, for schizophrenia,
*  for all sorts of conditions.
*  And scientists have actually been able to create pretty long lists of these genes where
*  there's strong evidence that if you have a certain version of a gene, you are at a greater
*  risk of getting these diseases.
*  And so these scientists who are pulling ancient DNA out of bones that are 5,000, 10,000 years old
*  are saying, well, let's see if these people who lived thousands of years ago had those genes too.
*  When did these mutations arise?
*  And how did they spread?
*  Let's trace the whole history of these mutations that today put us at risk of different diseases.
*  So how exactly did they do that?
*  Well, one of these projects is based on a British database called the UK Biobank.
*  What happens there is that half a million volunteers have submitted their DNA and allowed
*  scientists to compare their DNA to their own medical records.
*  So basically these scientists are tracing the diseases people have to mutations in their genes
*  and looking for patterns across populations.
*  That's right.
*  And so then what you can do is you can compare their DNA of these living people in Britain
*  to all of this ancient DNA from across Europe and Asia.
*  And you can try to figure out, well, where is their DNA coming from?
*  Who did they inherit their DNA from?
*  And did they actually inherit some of these disease genes from those ancient people?
*  So it's kind of like a 23 and me to figure out who you were related to in the Bronze Age, right?
*  And whether they pass down anything to you that might make you sick now.
*  That's right.
*  And what they found were mutations that today we know increase people's risks
*  for a whole bunch of different diseases.
*  But with a twist.
*  Some of these mutations were beneficial to those people thousands of years ago.
*  Okay, that is kind of mind blowing.
*  Okay, so explain that to me, Carl.
*  What's an example?
*  So we can go back to the Yamnaya for a really powerful example of this.
*  So the Yamnaya were herding animals.
*  They were with their animals all the time.
*  They were just going back and forth along the steppe, always with the animals.
*  And that was great because that gave them a source of meat.
*  It gave them a source of milk, of leather, wool, like this incredible resource to have right on hand.
*  But animals have something else.
*  They have diseases.
*  And so if you're going to be living with animals, you are actually at risk
*  of picking up some of the diseases that they're carrying.
*  So Carl, were the Yamnaya the first people to actually live with animals and then
*  therefore get sick from them?
*  Well, the Yamnaya were getting diseases from animals at a rate that was really different
*  than people had before because they were living with these animals so much of the time.
*  And we actually know that because we can see it for ourselves in their bones.
*  When you drill into the bones of the Yamnaya or other ancient people,
*  you can get out the DNA of the people themselves.
*  And sometimes you can also get the DNA out of the germs that killed them.
*  Amazing.
*  It is amazing.
*  And we know for a fact that they were dealing with a lot of diseases.
*  And it turns out that they were actually evolving a resistance to them.
*  Evolving resistance to them.
*  How exactly?
*  So if you had a mutation that ramped up your immune system so that you were better able to fight off
*  these germs that were spilling over from these animals all around you,
*  that would mean you're more likely to live long enough to have kids and pass down that gene to them.
*  So if you look across the DNA of Yamnaya, they have a lot of mutations
*  for the first time that are associated with a really strong immune response.
*  But there's something else that's really important about these genes in the Yamnaya.
*  These are some of the same genes that today can put people at risk for certain diseases.
*  One of those diseases is multiple sclerosis.
*  Multiple sclerosis like very debilitating disease.
*  That's right.
*  Yes.
*  When people develop multiple sclerosis, their immune cells look at their own nerves as the enemy.
*  They actually will attack the nerves in the body.
*  And this is incredibly debilitating.
*  It can progress to the point where people can't walk, have trouble talking.
*  It affects millions of people today.
*  And yet we're seeing some of the genes that put people at risk of MS today
*  actually being beneficial in the Yamnaya.
*  Okay. So explain that, Carl.
*  How was it protective to the Yamnaya?
*  But obviously very debilitating and problematic today.
*  Like how did that happen?
*  So if we go back to the Yamnaya, 4,000 or 5,000 years ago,
*  they are being exposed to a lot of diseases, a lot of bacteria, maybe a lot of viruses.
*  Now, recently, like in the past century, a lot of those pathogens have gone away.
*  So you have pasteurized milk, you have clean water,
*  you have all these innovations that make these pathogens much less of a threat.
*  To people's health.
*  But they still have this aggressive immune system.
*  They still have an immune system that evolved for this tug of war with the pathogens.
*  And now, if the immune system is not being continually challenged by these pathogens,
*  it looks like sometimes the immune system makes mistakes.
*  In its aggressiveness, it misfires.
*  So that there are opportunities to get confused and to start to look at a person's own body as the enemy.
*  Okay, that's pretty interesting that like something that was so protective through the ages
*  suddenly becomes a real hindrance because everything changed really in the past hundred years or so.
*  But how exactly does knowing this actually help people who have MS today, Carl?
*  What are the practical implications here?
*  Well, it helps us to understand why it is that some people get MS and other people don't.
*  Recent research has pointed to a virus called Epstein-Barr as the trigger for MS.
*  In other words, you probably don't get MS unless you get infected with Epstein-Barr.
*  But the fact is that most people get infected with Epstein-Barr.
*  And maybe a couple million people have MS.
*  So clearly, there's something special about these people.
*  And what's special is that they have inherited these genes.
*  And if you can understand how those genes first evolved,
*  what their functions were for 5,000 years ago,
*  that can actually help you to understand how they're going wrong now.
*  So, you know, right now there are some fairly effective treatments for MS.
*  They're okay for some people.
*  They're not great for others.
*  But they're crude.
*  They're kind of like a sledgehammer.
*  Basically, they just sort of take the immune system and just dial it all down.
*  That's good in some ways because then your immune system is not going to be
*  attacking yourself so readily.
*  But, you know, like you do need your immune system.
*  Right.
*  You actually do need it to avoid getting really sick from infections.
*  So really what we need to do is find a better balance.
*  We need to understand that what's happening is that the immune system just has lost this
*  partner in this dance of survival.
*  And so how can we mimic that?
*  Are there drugs that could actually like give the immune system that balance again
*  without us having to get really sick and things like that?
*  Okay. So understanding the origins means we go from treating MS with this big sledgehammer
*  to a little scalpel, right?
*  We can really fine tune the treatment.
*  That's right.
*  And we start to understand why different people are at greater risk of getting MS.
*  Why are the rates highest in Northern Europe?
*  People came up with all sorts of stories for a long time.
*  But we actually know why.
*  We know because the Yamnaya showed up.
*  So it takes some of the randomness out of it, right?
*  This research has really helped us understand something incredibly important
*  about this very debilitating disease.
*  It has.
*  And this is really just a trial run for this whole approach.
*  This research was based just on the UK biopeng, just on people in Britain.
*  But when we look forward, it's not just going to be British people
*  whose history scientists are going to be unpacking.
*  It's going to be people all over the world.
*  We're going to be learning not just about multiple sclerosis,
*  but we're going to be learning about diseases like heart disease, diabetes,
*  conditions like schizophrenia.
*  And it may be possible to understand how it is that actually maybe the genes that put us
*  at risk of these diseases today were giving us other benefits thousands of years ago.
*  So in effect, we could be sitting on a whole new cache of future cures, right?
*  In all of our archaeological sites.
*  Like is the future of medical research paleontology?
*  It could be.
*  It could be.
*  This is what scientists sometimes call evolutionary medicine.
*  But really up till now, it's been more of an idea than a reality.
*  But the experts I talk to say that with ancient DNA research like this,
*  evolutionary medicine is now finally coming of age.
*  Carl, thank you.
*  Thanks so much.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Tuesday, in a partisan indictment of President Biden's border policy,
*  House Republicans began pushing through articles of impeachment
*  against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.
*  Republicans are poised to charge Mayorkas with refusing to uphold the law
*  and with breaching the public trust in his handling of a surge of migrants
*  across the U.S. border with Mexico.
*  Democrats and many leaders have been trying to get the country to stop
*  the
*  U.S. border.
*  But the action could force an election year trial on the politically charged
*  issue of immigration and the southern border.
*  And Hamas said it was considering a proposal to pause the fighting in Gaza
*  and exchange with the U.S.
*  and the United States.
*  But the U.S.
*  has been forced to stop the U.S.
*  from doing so.
*  And the U.S.
*  was considering a proposal to pause the fighting in Gaza
*  and exchange Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners.
*  The deal's terms were finalized in Paris over the weekend by the United States,
*  Qatar, Egypt, and Israel, and involves a six-week ceasefire
*  in exchange for the release of more hostages.
*  In a statement, Hamas's political chief Ismail Haniyeh suggested that the group
*  was open to the deal but also reiterated its longstanding demand for a total
*  withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, one that Israel has repeatedly rejected.
*  Today's episode was produced by Alex Stern and Jessica Chung with help from
*  Shannon Lin and Carlos Prieto.
*  It was edited by M.J. Davis Lin with help from Mark George,
*  contains original music by Chelsea Daniel and Dan Powell,
*  and was engineered by Alyssa Moxley.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landsberg of Wonder Lee.
*  That's it for the Daily.
*  I'm Sabrina Taverneisi.
*  See you tomorrow.
