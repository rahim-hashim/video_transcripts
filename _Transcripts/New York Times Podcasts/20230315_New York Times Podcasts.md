# What to Know About the Covid Lab Leak Theory
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7NtdAllUUc)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Three years after the start of COVID, the central mystery of the pandemic, how exactly
*  it began, remains unsolved.
*  But recently, the debate about the origins of the virus has reemerged, this time in Congress.
*  Today, my colleague Benjamin Mueller, on what we actually know about how COVID started,
*  and why the politics are making it harder to find answers.
*  It's Wednesday, March 15th.
*  So Ben, in Washington last week, there was a hearing on the question of where and how
*  COVID actually began.
*  And it really felt like deja vu, right?
*  Like here we are again, three years later, listening to a debate about whether COVID
*  leaked from a lab or crossed over from a sick animal in a market.
*  How are we all of a sudden having this conversation again?
*  Well, Republicans took control of the House recently, and they've made it a priority
*  to investigate the origins of the virus.
*  They see themselves as having unfinished business, which is to look much more closely at how
*  the virus began, and specifically at a theory that's popular on the Republican side of
*  the aisle, which is that the virus may have accidentally leaked from a lab.
*  I think they have grievances with the way Democrats have handled many parts of the pandemic
*  response, and that includes the idea that Democrats have unfairly overlooked this theory
*  about how the virus started, the possibility that it came from a lab.
*  Good morning, everyone.
*  The select subcommittee on the coronavirus pandemic will come to order.
*  So they set up a committee to look at just that question, and they had their first hearing
*  last week.
*  And at it, they used the hearing to go after one of their most favorite political targets,
*  Tony Fauci, a public health official who led parts of the coronavirus response.
*  We released a memo highlighting new evidence.
*  That suggests that Dr. Fauci prompted the drafting of a publication that would disprove
*  the lab leak theory.
*  They blamed Fauci in particular for steering scientists away from the lab leak theory in
*  early 2020, and they furnished emails and other records that they say proves their case
*  against him.
*  This was a narrative that was decided that they were going to say this came from the
*  wet market, and they were going to do everything they could to support it, to negate any discussion
*  about the possibility that this came from a laboratory.
*  But it's not only Republicans who have taken interest in this question.
*  Democrats have become much more careful lately about saying that we need to investigate the
*  possibility that the virus came from a lab leak.
*  It is my sincere hope that we can conduct this work in an objective, bipartisan way
*  based on evidence to save lives.
*  If there is no further business without objection, the select subcommittee stands adjourned.
*  Thank you.
*  But then my memory of the lab leak theory is that it was something that Trump had really
*  pushed and had kind of gotten caught up in his rhetoric, right?
*  Like his insistence on calling it the China virus, like the pandemic was somehow China's
*  fault, but that it was also largely dismissed by scientists.
*  That's right.
*  Scientists early on in the pandemic, some of them referred to the lab leak theory as
*  a conspiracy theory.
*  President Trump has now claimed, without citing evidence, that COVID-19 likely originated
*  in a government lab in China.
*  It became very identified with Trump and his accusations against China.
*  Some people call it the Chinese flu, the China flu.
*  He even raised the idea that it might have been intentionally released from the lab.
*  Are you insinuating they intentionally let it spread?
*  Well, they could have done it.
*  And I'm just saying, well, one of two things happened.
*  They either didn't do it and, you know, they couldn't do it from a competent standpoint
*  or they let it spread.
*  I think that made it harder for scientists to openly talk about the idea that the virus
*  may have come out of a lab, even if that was only accidentally.
*  And so then what happened?
*  Well, that started changing when Trump left office.
*  I think he became a little less identified himself with the theory that the virus may
*  have leaked out of a lab.
*  There was also something really important that happened in early 2021.
*  An international group of scientists working for the World Health Organization arrived
*  in Wuhan.
*  The World Health Organization, with a lot of input from China, released a big report
*  about how the pandemic may have started.
*  How much cooperation did you get from the Chinese authorities when you did this investigation?
*  Was everything you would wish to see on the table?
*  That report said a lab leak was extremely unlikely.
*  It even ranked that possibility below one of China's pet theories, which is that the
*  virus came into the country from abroad.
*  And so now you have scientists who had spent a lot of 2020 either not investing that much
*  of their own work in looking into this question or sort of watching it from a distance, who
*  felt troubled by this report, who felt like China had had too much influence on its findings.
*  The World Health Organization had not gotten the evidence they might have, and that motivated
*  them to start speaking up more openly about the idea that a lab leak needed to be taken
*  seriously.
*  So how did the scientists go about doing that?
*  There was a group of 18 prominent scientists, that's virologists and other experts in the
*  field, who decided to publish an open letter in the scientific journal Science in May of
*  2021, pushing for all origin theories to be investigated.
*  What we're saying in this letter is, let's just refrain from offering our opinions and
*  simply look at the cold hard facts that we have available.
*  What that did, I think, is give Democrats and the Biden administration in particular
*  an opening to themselves come forward and push for the same sort of openness to the
*  lab leak theory.
*  President Biden apparently has some specific questions for the Chinese and he wants the
*  Intel folks to double down.
*  Which took the form of the Biden administration telling their intelligence agencies to review
*  the evidence and try to furnish their own answers about how the pandemic may have started.
*  And what did they find?
*  Initially a majority of the intelligence agencies weighed in in favor of the natural origin
*  theory, the idea that the virus spilled naturally from animals into humans outside of a lab.
*  But there was one agency, the FBI, that opened the door to the idea of a lab leak.
*  They were joined just two weeks ago by the Department of Energy, which long after Biden
*  ordered the initial review, updated its assessment, reviewed the intelligence, maybe found some
*  new intelligence and said that they, with low confidence, also think it's possible that
*  the virus leaked from a lab.
*  With low confidence?
*  What does that mean?
*  We're not exactly sure.
*  It's not clear that there's some smoking gun new evidence at all or how new the intelligence
*  even is that led them to this updated assessment.
*  What I think the new assessment has done is it's really revived the public debate around
*  the origins.
*  It's put it front and center and it's sort of re-energized the public conversation and
*  the conversation in Congress in a way that hasn't been true for some time.
*  So Ben, let's get into that debate.
*  I mean, you know, we have the changing of the guard in Congress, this new assessment
*  by this government agency, all resurfacing the theory.
*  But devil's advocate for a second here.
*  It's been three years.
*  Do we care about where it came from at this point?
*  Like, why is that important?
*  Well, I used to be a police reporter and I saw the kind of government resources that
*  got poured into answering the question of how even a single person was killed.
*  Here we've got a pandemic that's killed seven million people and sickened many others.
*  And so I think some public health officials feel a kind of moral obligation to those victims
*  to figure out how the pandemic started.
*  So what do we know at this point about what really happened?
*  And I'm assuming there's not one clear, you know, black and white answer to the thing.
*  There are the two main theories that have gotten a lot of public attention.
*  One of those is that the virus leaked from a lab or was related to research in some way.
*  And the other is that the virus spilled over naturally into humans outside of a lab from
*  some sort of animal source.
*  Okay, so let's start with a theory that the virus was leaked from a lab.
*  Tell me about that theory.
*  That theory starts really with a coincidence, which is that the virus happened to start
*  spreading in the city, Wuhan, that happens to house a major center for coronavirus research,
*  the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
*  Now early on, proponents of that theory were talking vaguely about the idea that the virus
*  may have been intentionally engineered as a kind of bio weapon.
*  The intelligence community later sort of took that theory off the table and said it was
*  not likely that it was a biological weapon.
*  But the theory that is still on the table is that researchers at that virology institute
*  in the course of trying to isolate a virus from a bat sample, for example, or tinkering
*  with the virus may have accidentally become infected themselves and let the virus into
*  Wuhan that way.
*  And Ben, what's the case for that theory?
*  Like what's the argument about what happened?
*  Well this lab in Wuhan was collecting new coronaviruses from bats, which are known to
*  harbor viruses that closely resemble the virus that ended up spreading in humans.
*  One of the leading researchers at the lab was this woman, Xi Zhengli, who was nicknamed
*  the Bat Woman for those very experiments on bat coronaviruses.
*  We also know that lab accidents do happen.
*  They've happened in China, as they have in the United States.
*  And some experts became more suspicious as they learned more about the kind of studies
*  that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was interested in.
*  That included a proposal in 2018 that outlined experiments looking at new coronaviruses and
*  a particular feature of viruses that can make them more efficient at infecting human cells.
*  So the lab was actually considering doing an experiment on coronaviruses and how to
*  make them more infectious in human cells.
*  That's the way some experts see it.
*  Now it's important to know that that grant proposal was rejected.
*  The researchers involved in it say the work was never done.
*  And some of the proposed experiments were in fact envisioned to happen at the University
*  of North Carolina and not in Wuhan at all.
*  It's also important to know that scientists who've looked at the genetic sequence of the
*  virus say it doesn't bear the sort of hallmark features of genetic engineering.
*  And I'd say the most important thing to know is that it's not really possible for scientists
*  to make one of these viruses from scratch.
*  They've got to start somewhere.
*  And as far as we know, no labs in Wuhan had a virus in their collections that they could
*  have altered in such a way that that virus became the pandemic virus.
*  So what's the bottom line for this lab leak theory overall?
*  Like does any of it add up to any conclusive understanding of how COVID started?
*  Some scientists think there's the circumstantial evidence pointing in the direction of the
*  lab leak, but no, as of yet there is no hard evidence that's emerged suggesting this pandemic
*  came from a lab.
*  Now where does the evidence point?
*  Well many experts believe that the evidence actually points more strongly now than it
*  ever has toward this one wild animal market in Wuhan.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Ben, you just said that there's evidence pointing to the theory about the animal market.
*  This is where COVID really came from.
*  And of course, this has been kind of the primary operating theory of many scientists since
*  really the early days of the pandemic.
*  So tell me about this theory.
*  Lay it out for me.
*  Well, there's a market in Wuhan called the Huanan market.
*  We know that that market sold in the months before the start of the coronavirus pandemic.
*  Animals that are known to harbor viruses very much like this.
*  That includes the raccoon dog, for example, which is a kind of cross between a fox and
*  a raccoon.
*  Some of the very early cases of the virus were linked to the market.
*  And so the theory goes that an animal at this market was sick and passed the virus to some
*  one who was shopping there or someone who was working there or someone who was trading
*  animals at the market.
*  And Ben, what's the evidence supporting this theory?
*  Like what's the case for the market being the culprit?
*  Well, every previous human coronavirus has had an animal origin, as do most human viruses
*  in general.
*  And we actually have to look back only a couple decades for a very similar event to have happened
*  in China.
*  So in late 2002, there's an outbreak of a virus called SARS-1 related to this coronavirus
*  that ended up killing almost 800 people.
*  That outbreak is believed to have begun at a wild animal market that was selling animals,
*  including raccoon dogs.
*  OK, so other coronaviruses that we've seen have actually started at animal markets as
*  well.
*  What other evidence was out there?
*  The missing piece of evidence in this case is an animal that was infected.
*  We know with the virus at the market shortly before the pandemic started.
*  Now part of the reason for that is that the police moved very quickly to shut down the
*  market after the coronavirus outbreak started.
*  That's a huge difference from back in the days of SARS-1 when scientists could sort
*  of waltz into the market and freely sample animals that were being sold there.
*  So in the absence of that kind of evidence, scientists have combed through what other
*  clues they might be able to use to build a picture of how this outbreak began.
*  A lot of those clues were assembled for a series of two studies that were published
*  about a year ago now.
*  Those studies looked, for example, at the home addresses of early COVID patients and
*  asked where were those patients clustered, whether or not they had shopped at the market
*  or worked at the market, where did they live?
*  And it turned out that those patients lived in much closer proximity to the market than
*  the scientists said you would have expected by pure chance.
*  They also zoomed in on the market itself and said, well, we know that researchers didn't
*  have access to live animals, but they did sample the walls and the cages and the drains
*  of that market looking for evidence of the coronavirus and they found some.
*  And they said that those samples predominantly came from parts of the market that were selling
*  live animals, including particular stalls where in previous years, researchers had found
*  animals in very close proximity to each other, living among each other in a way that made
*  it easy for viruses to spread and mutate and jump into humans, including, for example,
*  raccoon dogs living in a cage that sat right on top of a cage that housed birds.
*  But Ben, didn't you say that this kind of trade had been made illegal in China?
*  I mean, after all, it had spread the SARS epidemic, right?
*  That's right.
*  It was a step down after the SARS outbreak, which is part of why experts think China would
*  have been so sensitive to the idea that there was this illegal activity happening right
*  under their noses in the very same kind of market that we know poses huge risks for viruses
*  jumping into humans.
*  So that's perhaps partly why the authorities moved quickly to shut down the market.
*  And beyond that, made it very hard to investigate the farms that were supplying the market,
*  for example.
*  Those animals, too, were either released or killed or the farms were closed.
*  That all has made it hard to sort of build the complete picture of the outbreak if it
*  did indeed start at the market in the way that some scientists wish we could.
*  And what does China itself say happened?
*  Like what's its version of the origins of COVID?
*  China's argued that the virus came from anywhere but within China's borders.
*  They've suggested that the virus may have sprung from an American military lab.
*  They've suggested that maybe it came in on big shipments of frozen food packages.
*  And are either of these remotely plausible?
*  Scientists think they're a bit ridiculous and don't put much stock in those explanations.
*  They think there's very strong evidence that the pandemic did start in China.
*  But I think in the course of making those kinds of arguments, China has made it very
*  difficult for researchers to go back and do the sorts of follow up investigations within
*  China's borders that could help us nail down the question of how the pandemic started.
*  So for example, they've not given researchers the kind of access to blood banks that could
*  help establish what sort of patients and how many and who they were who were infected in
*  the very earliest stages of the outbreak.
*  They've not been as transparent as many folks think they could have been about the kind
*  of research happening in labs in Wuhan.
*  And I was talking about those samples earlier that they took from the walls and the cages
*  of the Huanan market.
*  They've not published the complete genetic sequences from those swabs that could help
*  us get a sense of what sort of animals they came from and who may have been infected within
*  the market.
*  So Ben, after hearing you lay all of this out for me, I am left kind of wondering whether
*  there's enough evidence for the animal market theory.
*  Some scientists think that that evidence does paint a compelling picture of a virus that
*  started at the market, the combination of the location data and what we know about the
*  animals being sold there and the genetic evidence from the early sequences of the coronavirus.
*  They think that that points strongly to the market.
*  Other scientists are much more focused on the holes in that theory that remain.
*  But I would say that most virus experts think that the evidence so far published points
*  to an origin at the market.
*  That's definitely where most of the sort of published peer-reviewed scientific evidence
*  sits at the moment.
*  So Ben, stepping back here, it sounds like there's still a lot we don't know.
*  And that, of course, leaves the door open for more and more debate about what actually
*  happened.
*  It leaves the door open for politics to keep going and to keep trying to answer the question
*  in committee hearings like the one we just had.
*  I guess my question is, does it matter that we can't come to a conclusion on this?
*  It matters because we've all lived through this horrendous pandemic and we, and especially
*  scientists, are obsessed with figuring out how it all started.
*  Despite that, though, I think the truth is we might never have the conclusive evidence
*  that some people crave to be able to come to a sort of settled conclusion.
*  But I think the question about the origins of this virus inevitably shapes the conversation
*  about what steps we should take to best prevent the next pandemic.
*  On the one hand, you have experts who have been voicing concern for decades about the
*  risks of dangerous lab experiments and about the sensible steps that we can take to both
*  preserve the value of those experiments, which is to help produce vaccines and therapeutics,
*  while also reducing the chances that a virus spills out of those labs and starts an outbreak.
*  It's also true that nature is running experiments that are in some cases far more dangerous
*  than anything being cooked up in labs.
*  In the last few months, we've seen the bird flu spread rampantly across countries.
*  That's included in Spain, where it's spilled into mink farms and in passing from mink to
*  mink, picked up mutations that some scientists worry could make the virus more transmissible
*  in humans.
*  Those are exactly the kind of natural experiments that scientists think we need to be paying
*  attention to, even as we also focus on the risk of lab accidents.
*  I think some scientists are worried that in the course of getting so fixated on one hypothesis
*  or another, that we lose sight of the steps we need to take right now to address the threat
*  of future pandemics.
*  Ben, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  After almost a week of chaos in the banking industry, the crisis appeared to ease on Tuesday
*  as pressure began to lift on midsize and regional lenders that were the most at risk.
*  Shares of regional banks, including First Republic Bank, which had to take emergency
*  action to shore up its finances over the weekend, bounced back over the course of the day.
*  The crisis began last week when a sudden drop in the value of Silicon Valley Bank triggered
*  a run on the bank.
*  The Times reports that the Justice Department is investigating that collapse.
*  And American officials said that a Russian military jet flew into an American reconnaissance
*  drone over the Black Sea, causing the drone to crash into international waters.
*  Russia, for its part, denied the collision and said that the drone had crashed of its
*  own accord.
*  A National Security Council spokesman called the behavior of the Russians, quote, unsafe
*  and unprofessional.
*  If a collision is confirmed, it would be the first known physical contact between the two
*  nations' militaries as a result of the war in Ukraine.
