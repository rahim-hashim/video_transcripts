# Amazon’s Most Beloved Features May Turn Out to Be Illegal
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tktxhIdGXPg)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Boborio. This is The Daily.
*  Last week, when the U.S. government filed a landmark antitrust lawsuit against Amazon,
*  it pointed to a set of familiar features that have made Amazon so beloved by consumers.
*  Today, my colleague Karen Weiss on why those beloved features may actually be illegal.
*  It's Monday, October 2nd.
*  Karen, now that the U.S. government has actually sued Amazon for monopolistic tactics,
*  we wanted to talk to you, somebody who has covered Amazon for years, about the very specific ways
*  that Amazon has allegedly broken the law. So talk us through that.
*  Yeah, so the Federal Trade Commission looked at a lot of things, but they said in the end,
*  it kind of boiled down to two tactics that are behind the scenes of things that we all know.
*  So one is how we buy things on Amazon. When you click buy, the buy now button,
*  and then also prime shipping, that super fast shipping that is part of how things get to your door so quickly.
*  Right. What you just mentioned are basically the throbbing heart of my relationship with Amazon.
*  I assume everyone's relationship to Amazon. And you're saying those are at the center of
*  this federal action against Amazon. Exactly. And the government is saying
*  there are these very sophisticated mechanisms that let Amazon illegally maintain its monopoly.
*  That's kind of the core of their argument, that behind the things that we all see,
*  there's this grip of power over not just the sellers on Amazon's website, but over the whole internet.
*  Okay, so I want you to explain this behind the scenes grip on the internet and consumers and
*  sellers that Amazon has developed through these two items you mentioned. And let's start with
*  the buy now button and how, according to our government, that has been misused by Amazon.
*  Sure. So the first thing you have to understand briefly is that most things we buy on Amazon
*  are not actually sold directly by Amazon. They're sold by outside sellers. And these are companies
*  and brands that list their products on Amazon's marketplace. And as a consumer, that whole world
*  of sellers is more or less invisible. Mostly what you see is you go to a product page and you see
*  these big orange and yellow buttons that say buy now and add to cart, or they entice you free
*  delivery. This could be here tomorrow if you order in the next hour. That is called a buy box.
*  And so the government says Amazon has used this buy box, those buttons, as one of its key ways
*  it prevents discounting across the internet. And how does that work? Sure. So they're basically
*  saying that Amazon wants to have the lowest price available for a product. And it does that,
*  it enforces that by saying if a product is available on another website, it crawls the web,
*  Amazon has these machines that go across, scrapes other websites, and if they find it's even one
*  penny less elsewhere, they will essentially punish the seller for that happening. And they do that
*  by removing those big bright buy now and add to cart button. And instead they make this little
*  button that says, you know, just plain black and white text that says see all buying options. It's
*  like the opposite of calling you to action, the opposite of enticing you to buy. Maybe you've
*  landed on a page like this, I know I have, where it just has, it's like, how do I even buy this
*  thing? It looks like it's unavailable, even though technically it is available.
*  You're saying that Amazon regularly scours the online retail world and figures out if one of its
*  sellers is simultaneously selling on another online retail platform at a lower price. And if
*  it discovers that's the case, it basically demotes that product and I guess that seller on Amazon
*  and makes you not really want to buy their stuff because it doesn't even give you the buy now button.
*  Exactly, exactly. So for most sellers, Amazon is a huge portion of their sales. And so if the buy
*  button goes away, their sales plummet. And then the sellers have to figure out what to do. And
*  they can do two things. They can either raise their price on another website or lower their price
*  on Amazon. And what the FTC in this complaint against Amazon says is that they say Amazon
*  knows that sellers often raise their price elsewhere. And here's an example of how that
*  might work. So for a story a couple years ago, I spoke with a company called Vita Cup,
*  and they make those little coffee pods, theirs have vitamins infused in them. And so they wanted to
*  reach new customers and decided to offer a deal on a different website that has a different model.
*  They basically do these flash sales, so deep discounts, but with slow shipping. And so they
*  offer their coffee pods at 30% off on this other website. But when Amazon's web crawlers find this,
*  they remove that buy now button. And all of a sudden sales plunge. And for Vita Cup,
*  like many sellers, like most sellers I've spoken with, Amazon is most of their sales.
*  And so all of a sudden, their biggest outlet, the sales go close to zero for them. And so they then
*  scramble and they email the other website and said, please take the listing down immediately.
*  Because I can't afford to lose my Amazon sales like I am.
*  So in this example with Vita Cup, we clearly see that Amazon's decision to remove the buy now button
*  is so meaningful that the seller takes their product off of a rival website once they lose
*  that button. It doesn't just raise the price, says, oh, I can't even do business with you anymore,
*  which suggests just how powerful this tactic of removing the buy button really is.
*  Exactly. I mean, I've talked to sellers who don't even list on other websites at all because they're
*  like, you know, it's not worth losing my sales on Amazon. And so the complaint against Amazon is
*  saying this has an effect across the internet of preventing discounting that yes, Amazon may have
*  the lowest price, but it's actually raising the costs across websites because Amazon is essentially
*  policing what people sell elsewhere. Amazon is basically preventing deals from happening elsewhere,
*  which effectively means it has almost sole control over the price in the entire market.
*  That's what the FTC is alleging. And if you know anything about antitrust law,
*  what we are describing here, Karen, sounds a lot like something that is anti-competition
*  and anti-consumer choice. Exactly. Because they're saying that this mechanism, this anti-discounting
*  control that Amazon has, that's how they talk about it, that it has the effect of making it
*  so competitors can't compete on price. Got it. Okay. I think that brings us to the second example
*  that you mentioned, Amazon Prime, perhaps even better known than the buy now button.
*  Everyone enrolls in it, seemingly, because you get really good deals and you get them delivered
*  in insanely fast ways. How does the government say that Prime is being abused here?
*  They're really focusing on the shipping component of Prime. Prime is this membership program
*  that an estimated 170 million American people have. This is most adults in America.
*  Yeah, kind of like half the country. Half the country if you include kids.
*  Lots of people. Right. Prime works because people love Prime. There's this idea at Amazon,
*  people love great selection, great prices, and fast delivery. They will always love those things,
*  and you focus on that, and you have this flywheel, this virtual circle that consumers love.
*  Right. And so what's the problem? So the way Amazon has done this is by building all of their
*  logistics infrastructure, warehouses, delivery vans, those vans you see driving down your street
*  all the time. Yep. And the FTC is saying that they basically force sellers to use their
*  logistics operations. How so? Basically, to get that check mark, to get it to say that this is
*  a Prime product, the sellers have had to pay Amazon to use this program called Fulfillment
*  by Amazon. They have to use Amazon's warehouses. They have to use Amazon's logistics, this vast
*  system you just described. Exactly. So they send their product to Amazon. Amazon puts it through
*  all these buildings. When you click buy, pretty much immediately it gets put in a box and put on
*  a truck and to your house. And it's doing that faster and faster every single day. But if you
*  don't use Amazon's logistics, you don't use their warehouses, then you don't get that check mark.
*  You're not Prime eligible. And then your sales are going to tank because customers are looking
*  for that. We've seen that time and again. And so sellers know that. And it's very hard to build a
*  business on Amazon if you don't ship through Amazon. So if you're a seller, this isn't really
*  feeling like that much of a choice. You're basically being compelled to use Amazon's vast
*  logistics system, or you're going to be locked out of half of America's buying habits, which are
*  Amazon Prime. That's exactly right. And when I talk to sellers, they say the more you get into
*  Amazon's logistics, the more you're into the whole Amazon system, the harder it is, the more
*  complicated, the more expensive it can be to sell elsewhere because you have so much of your sales
*  are on Amazon, that you then all of a sudden have to set up a whole different supply chain and
*  figure out different warehouses just gets much more complicated. Right. And I'm going to guess
*  that some sellers basically decide, this is too much of a headache. I'm only going to sell the
*  Amazon, which then calls back to our earlier conversation about the buy button. So what you're
*  describing collectively is just a tremendous amount of control. Exactly. Amazon has so much scale,
*  so many orders it's delivering, it can deliver them really efficiently, really, really quickly.
*  And that's incredibly hard to compete with now. If you look at the number of warehouses, the number
*  of drivers, the speed of their delivery, it's unsurpassed. I mean, it is incredible. Right.
*  And so what we as consumers have come to understand as Amazon's brilliance, its ability to be so fast
*  and so cheap, this is why we all use it. What the FTC is saying is it's actually built on a couple of
*  tactics that ultimately are kind of coercion for sellers. Exactly. That's exactly right.
*  And that there's a broader effect on consumers.
*  That it has an effect of both raising prices and an effect of limiting our choice,
*  because there aren't that many places that can viably compete with Amazon anymore.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Aaron Norris Karen, I imagine that Amazon and their lawyers have
*  a very robust defense to this lawsuit. And I wonder if you can represent their counter-argument,
*  both to the charges about these two specific tactics and to the larger allegation being made
*  by the US government that Amazon is being monopolistic, anti-competitive and bad for the
*  economy. Sure. So when you talk about that buy now button, the buy box, Amazon says,
*  why in the world should we show our customers bad deals? Why should we knowingly let our customers
*  buy something that we think is not the best deal around? And people trust us because they know that
*  we can give them the best deal around. So in some sense, it's kind of a simple argument.
*  We serve customers and we're not going to do wrong by them. And for prime and logistics,
*  they say, look, we've made billions of dollars of investments in these warehouses and let sellers
*  use it. That this has actually made it very easy for sellers to build businesses. You can build a
*  business without being a supply chain person. You can just be great at coming up with like this
*  really cool new toy for kids or whatever it is. They say that it's very well priced,
*  which most sellers I talk to say is true. And they say it's very easy. And it's actually unlocked
*  this business for so many people and let so many sellers get something that customers love, which
*  is this unbelievably fast and reliable delivery that we all know. And that makes so many things
*  so simple. I would say broadly, their argument is the FTC has this totally upside down.
*  Also, Amazon says that they are the most customer obsessed company in the world and that every
*  decision they make is what is best for customers. We're going to show them the best deal. We're
*  going to get them things fastest that they do things with the customer in mind that has had an
*  effect of creating this whole world of sellers that didn't really exist, that it's lower prices
*  broadly over time, that it's just made this whole ecosystem work essentially in a way that
*  customers clearly love because they keep coming back for more. But in theory and in practice,
*  it's possible for two things to be true at the same time. And I'm sure that's what the government
*  is going to say in response to Amazon's response, which is you can be a customer focused company.
*  You can be great at delivering fast, discounted products to customers. And you can simultaneously
*  be making life very hard for sellers by eliminating their choices through coercive tactics that
*  ultimately over time might be bad for consumers. I think that's right. There's kind of two sides
*  to this coin. It's like what is good in the Amazon universe for Amazon customers and what
*  is good for customers broadly? Are we missing out on things that we don't even know? Are we paying
*  more than we even realize we need to be? Are there other websites, other companies that could
*  have started up and done things differently that we don't even, it's like, what don't we know?
*  Right. What don't we know because we so thoroughly live in Amazon's world.
*  That's exactly right.
*  So that of course raises the question of what will happen to Amazon if it loses this case and what
*  does the government really want here in the end? Does it want to basically turn back the clock,
*  turn back the clock to a time where Amazon doesn't so thoroughly dictate the terms of
*  the American retail landscape? And if that is the goal, what might that look like?
*  The government doesn't exactly say what they want. They don't say we're going to break Amazon up.
*  They just say we want to undo these things. And what Amazon says is that it's going to force them
*  to unwind all these things that customers love. They won't be able to offer their prices. They
*  won't be able to make it as easy and as simple as possible. These are the things that keep us
*  coming back for more. All these things, they have to unwind it. And that's very hard to do.
*  And I know because I tried to do it myself.
*  What do you mean?
*  About a year ago, my husband and I did something that very few people do,
*  which is we canceled our Prime subscription.
*  Huh. You predicted that there was going to be an antitrust case.
*  Exactly.
*  And you just went ahead and said, what will this future potentially look like?
*  Exactly.
*  You know, it did come out of reporting though. This was not a protest thing. This was not like
*  an Amazon's bad thing. This was us looking at our finances. And we felt like many Americans,
*  we spent a lot of money in the pandemic. We were just buying a lot of stuff. And we wanted to buy
*  less stuff. And so I know from reporting, we know from what Amazon tells sellers, we know from
*  our own experience that the easier things are to buy, the more you buy them.
*  Right. And nothing's easier than Amazon Prime. So you drop it.
*  So we dropped it. Yeah. It was an experiment. Would we miss it? Would we agreed we'd pay for
*  fast shipping when we wanted it? We wouldn't when we didn't. We might put things in the cart,
*  but not click buy eventually. And we're just curious, like what would happen?
*  And so what happens? Tell us about this alternate universe.
*  It's very weird. It's like you have to plan ahead a little bit. I found that I spent more on other
*  websites as a result of it. You know, Target, you know, one year my kids swim class, I put things
*  to buy online and pick up in their store and I go and swing by and get it. I also found that we did
*  buy less. You know, there were things that I searched for. And when I saw it, it wouldn't be
*  available in the time for when I wanted it. We just didn't buy it. You know, I remember we were
*  going camping with friends and I was considering getting these reusable water balloons, which are
*  a thing with kids these days. They're kind of cool. They don't produce the scraps all over the
*  ground. And I couldn't get it fast enough. And so we just didn't buy it before we went camping. And
*  guess what? Camping was okay. But then there were other times, like I had the Seattle Bureau for
*  the New York Times over for a barbecue and I wanted to get something for the kids to play with
*  outside. So I ordered these little tiny soccer goals and we paid $8 or whatever for the shipping
*  and it got there before the weekend. And the kids actually spent a ton of time playing with their
*  soccer goals. Broadly, I definitely spent way less on shipping because I realized very few things are
*  quite that urgent. It's striking to me, Karen, your experience in some ways, like you said, you are
*  kind of making the case for Amazon because what you have found is that there's life beyond Amazon.
*  You can opt out of it and you're fine. Therefore, it's a little hard to think of them as a coercive
*  monopoly that you can't avoid in our economy. But on the other hand, what you're describing,
*  the experience you're having, requires you to have a totally rethought version of being a consumer
*  than the one the rest of us have gotten used to quite happily. And you have volunteered to have
*  a more burdensome version of buying stuff, waiting for it, diversifying your shopping experience,
*  driving to a store, God forbid. So you're kind of making Amazon's point. You're also kind of
*  undermining it. That's exactly right. Amazon fundamentally changed what we all expect.
*  I mean, even in the year since I stopped having Prime, their shipping speeds for Prime have
*  dramatically improved. They're faster than they've ever been. They've built all these
*  warehouses in the pandemic and now they are putting them to use like you would not believe.
*  They're getting things so fast. They have taught us how to shop online, basically. And that is
*  very hard to unwind as a consumer. I did it as an experiment and I'm an outlier and I don't even know.
*  We may still rejoin Prime. We haven't even decided because there are definitely times
*  where I'm like, oh man, this would have been really nice to have.
*  Right. I mean, ultimately what you're saying is no matter what happens here, no matter how this case
*  gets resolved, it's going to be really hard, perhaps even impossible, to unrewire our brains
*  in the way that Amazon has as consumers. Right. They have taught us that we can go to them,
*  open, click, buy, the item shows up at your doorstep that day, done. I mean,
*  that's a very hard loop to break. Well, Karen, thank you very much. We appreciate it. Anytime.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to another day. I have very good news for the country. Democrats
*  and Republicans have come to an agreement and the government will remain open. We will have avoided
*  a shutdown. Over the weekend, the U.S. government narrowly averted a shutdown that had appeared to
*  be all but certain after Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy put forth a short-term spending
*  bill that won more support from House Democrats than it did from House Republicans. Hours later,
*  that bill was adopted by the Democratic controlled U.S. Senate and signed by President Biden,
*  moments before the government was scheduled to shut down. The bipartisan outcome was the
*  exact scenario that McCarthy had sought to avoid for fear of upsetting the House's far-right
*  membership who unanimously voted against the bill and who may now use it as a pretext to try to
*  remove McCarthy as House Speaker in the coming days. During a news conference, McCarthy said he
*  was willing to take that risk. If somebody wants to make a motion against me, bring it.
*  There has to be an adult in the room. Democrats, especially in the Senate, celebrated the moment
*  as both an economic and political victory and as a chance to scold House Republicans
*  for their partisanship. If there is one lesson for House Republicans to take from the absolute
*  chaos they have caused this past week, it is that partisanship is not a path forward, it's a path to chaos.
