# What Phil Donahue Meant to Me
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA4DyYcxKnM)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, a tribute to Phil Donahue, the king of daytime talk, from me.
*  It's Friday, August 30th.
*  On the inside, foreclosed that Tristan Longstreet, at bold three, detergent plus fabric sofa.
*  From NBC News, this is Today.
*  When I was growing up, there were four television shows that I watched religiously.
*  The Today Show.
*  I love that Wayne Gretzky.
*  He's a good guy.
*  And his wife, the doll, too.
*  And their children are really cute.
*  Because Matt and Katie were pure magic together, on that set.
*  60 Minutes.
*  Because nobody has ever told stories like that on network TV.
*  General Hospital.
*  I do trust my husband.
*  He loves me.
*  And we're married and we're happy.
*  And there's nothing that you or Miranda or anyone is ever going to do to change that.
*  Because all of us have a guilty pleasure.
*  And finally, the Phil Donahue Show.
*  Now why Donahue?
*  Your parents do not know that you lead this double life.
*  You leave the apartment after they've gone to sleep.
*  Is that right?
*  Yeah.
*  Uh huh.
*  Yes.
*  Good.
*  That's a good answer.
*  Yeah.
*  Why was I, why were millions of other Americans, drawn to this middle-aged host of a daytime
*  talk show?
*  You dress up like this because first of all, it's fun and hey.
*  Certainly.
*  This guy with a helmet of gray hair and what always seemed to me anyway to be the world's
*  longest, slimmest microphone.
*  As far as songs go, every song is a message.
*  Who sprinted around his studio in a beige 3P suit.
*  The message of good night, Irene.
*  The lyrics were, Irene, good night, Irene.
*  It never really occurred to me to try and answer that question.
*  Donahue has been off the air now for more than 20 years.
*  He's no longer a household name.
*  The culture has kind of forgotten him.
*  But then a few days ago, he died at the age of 88.
*  And suddenly I wanted to know what had it been about Donahue.
*  So I logged on YouTube and I started to watch a show again.
*  And I was right back in my childhood basement with the gray commercial carpet and the exposed
*  pipes.
*  And if you're married, you can't have the job because you might have children.
*  And if you have children, you can't have the job because they might get sick and you'd
*  have to take care of them.
*  If you didn't, you'd be a bad mother.
*  Any condition of being a female still may be used against you no matter what.
*  And what I remembered right away was Donahue's extraordinary intellectual range.
*  135,000 citizens were displaced because of the explosion in Chernobyl.
*  And some of them lived here.
*  One day he'd interview a presidential candidate.
*  Throughout this imperfect part of your marriage, did you ever separate you and Hillary?
*  No.
*  There's none of your business if we did.
*  The next, an activist.
*  If we don't put a halt to this new kind of nuclear war fighting which we're moving into,
*  we are going to guarantee that we have a nuclear war.
*  The day after that, a celebrity.
*  Please welcome the Divine Miss M. Here's Bette Midler.
*  An illiterate adult.
*  You came out of the closet, so to speak, two years ago.
*  October 16th.
*  And no one knew except my wife.
*  Who somehow had outwitted his college professors and his bosses and still couldn't read at
*  the age of 45 despite having a big corporate job.
*  And I might add that I am healing as we all are healing from the trauma of being an illiterate
*  in this dominant literate society.
*  It must be terrifying.
*  Now, remember, this is daytime talk.
*  At a time when daytime talk didn't really exist.
*  Donahue is competing with soap operas and game shows and his show was the exact opposite
*  of all of that escapism.
*  It was the AIDS crisis.
*  To what?
*  That we don't have to worry about catching AIDS in the air?
*  AIDS is not transmitted by casual contact.
*  It never has and it probably never will be.
*  It was the hardcore scene in New York.
*  He devoted an entire episode to that.
*  Yeah, well, share with us some of the feelings that make you feel comfortable in this group.
*  Well, people are always seeming to try to tell us what to do, where to go, how to talk,
*  how to walk, what to wear.
*  And we're just trying to say that maybe there's an alternative to what is set before us and
*  told dictated to us.
*  And it was this incessant curiosity about ideas and motivations, why people did what
*  they did, why they believed what they believed, what made people who they are.
*  But that doesn't quite explain why I think so many of us were watching Donahue.
*  It was this thing he did on top of all of that.
*  It was how he treated his audience.
*  Now remember, until this point, a studio audience was basically an inanimate object.
*  Mike, you know about the evil presence in my office, right?
*  Of course I do, Paul.
*  She's standing right next to you.
*  Boo-ya!
*  They laughed, sometimes literally on a laugh track.
*  They clapped in unison.
*  They were basically a prop.
*  Let me go out in the audience and get some observations.
*  What do you think of all this business of student protest?
*  For example, Columbia, Berkeley, another...
*  But in Donahue's hands, the audience became just as important as the guest on the stage.
*  Yes, ma'am.
*  I think there's racism everywhere and you cannot pinpoint it on a particular race, but
*  it depends on the individual.
*  And I think that as long as we keep calling people black and white, that's when racism's
*  going to continue.
*  I know you want to...
*  As soon as that happens, you let me know, okay?
*  And this wasn't an accident.
*  This was quite deliberate.
*  Donahue made the audience central to the show from the very beginning and he talked about
*  how it happened and why it happened in interviews.
*  Welcome to Speaking Freely.
*  I'm Ken Paulson.
*  It's a pleasure to welcome Phil Donahue.
*  Thank you.
*  And he liked to tell the story of how the show's origins in Dayton, Ohio, forced him
*  to do it.
*  We tried to get movie stars.
*  Everybody but us had movie stars.
*  We would call movie stars and they'd say, Dayton, that's the soapbox derby.
*  I said, no, that's Akron.
*  Dayton is...
*  He could never persuade big name guests to come to Dayton.
*  So he gravitated to issues.
*  We discovered that issues would keep us on the air.
*  Issues.
*  And when it came to issues, it turned out that the most interesting perspectives were
*  not his.
*  And suddenly the audience is starting to ask better questions than I was during the commercials.
*  And I got up one day and walked out and we realize now that if it hadn't been for that,
*  we probably would not have survived.
*  I just don't think you can sell two talking heads in front of a curtain for very long.
*  Now you tell me.
*  And so slowly but surely, he started to turn his microphone and his show over to his audience.
*  And people's hands were going up all over and I couldn't get to them fast enough.
*  And since this was the 1960s and the 1970s and it was in the middle of men's workday,
*  turning his microphone over to the audience really meant turning his microphone and eventually
*  his show over to women.
*  Racism was rampant at the time.
*  The mantra in the television game was the only thing women care about is covered dishes,
*  needle point, and children and mothering.
*  That's all.
*  And we came along and it was clear that behind this stereotype were thinking, live human
*  beings who wanted to get in the act, who had something to say, who wanted to kick tires,
*  who wanted to get mad, who were mad at doctors for patronizing them.
*  And we exploited all this to our own advantage.
*  So in the relative obscurity of Dayton, Ohio, Donahue was undertaking a pretty radical experiment
*  in the history of television.
*  He was asking women what they thought.
*  And he was taking their lives and their needs very seriously.
*  We are inside an abortion clinic in Chicago.
*  The patient with her back to the camera is in the first trimester of an unwanted pregnancy.
*  He televised an abortion.
*  Our patient, having been told what to expect, walks to the treatment room where she meets
*  the doctor for the first time.
*  The medical term for this abortion is vacuum aspiration.
*  He televised a tubal ligation surgery.
*  He televised a child's birth.
*  Of course, not all his gestures towards women were super high minded.
*  Ladies, for those of you that prefer Italian men, one of Houston's top models, Mr. GQ himself
*  the Italian stallion.
*  There were the episodes about male strippers where these guys came out on the set, took
*  off all their clothes and the women went wild.
*  And Donahue made very clear that those pitches came from the women on his staff, not him.
*  Then there's this moment in an episode in 1979.
*  Here's a woman who's read by millions around the world.
*  She may be our most debated philosopher.
*  Where all of these puzzle pieces of what made Donahue Donahue come together, his curiosity,
*  his female audience, and these feminist ideas that his show so often probed.
*  A warm human being who has a lot to say and comes straight at everything she says.
*  I am pleased to present Ayn Rand.
*  It was an interview with the writer Ayn Rand.
*  So your view is if we all became more comfortable with our natural tendencies, that is to say
*  selfishness, there would be less horror, less war, less Hitler.
*  There wouldn't be any.
*  And just think about that for a moment.
*  Ayn Rand, one of the great public intellectuals of her era or really any era, this champion
*  of rational selfishness and capitalism unbound on daytime television.
*  So the more selfish we are, the more tranquil and peaceful the world in which we live.
*  And more benevolent toward other people if we're rationally selfish.
*  And this moment starts, as so many great Donahue moments do, with a question from the audience.
*  Ms. Rand, in your novels, you portray very strong women.
*  I was wondering why you think in the world we don't have strong women leaders.
*  Because if you're speaking about women's liberation, that whole movement, it's a very
*  false and funny issue.
*  And Rand responds by basically casting doubt on the whole movement for women's rights.
*  Women are human beings, so they need leaders just like men.
*  They need leaders who are men or women as the leaders have earned.
*  And then Donahue jumps in.
*  Well, but the point is that women feel because of the cultural inhibitors that have been
*  placed on women, some sort of woman leadership is needed.
*  And he asks Ayn Rand how she thinks that women can get ahead.
*  For him, this avowed feminist, the answer seems pretty obvious.
*  What's needed is a formal, sustained effort to advocate for women's equality.
*  You can do it only by education.
*  You do it by spreading the right idea that women intellectually are not the inferior
*  of men.
*  That's what feminists are doing.
*  They're standing up and educating.
*  No.
*  But Rand totally rejects that.
*  They're asking for government power and government handouts.
*  They go around depriving men of jobs because you have to have water of so many women.
*  But their point is that they have been denied jobs all these years.
*  Donahue wants to talk about systemic barriers.
*  Rand wants to talk about hard work.
*  Well, what should they do?
*  Be nice little girls and not say anything and stay home and break bread?
*  No.
*  Well, what should they do?
*  Should they?
*  Go into any career of their choice except longshoremen or professional football players
*  who are crying today and cry for their career as every man has to fight.
*  In her mind, women simply have to prove themselves one by one.
*  And in Rand's telling, in any reasonable, logical free market economy,
*  talented women will eventually just rise.
*  It will happen.
*  All you have to do is show your ability and if someone is prejudiced and doesn't hire you,
*  the intelligent employer will.
*  But then as the conversation keeps going, this heady, fascinating back and forth about
*  feminism and capitalism, something really interesting happens when another woman in
*  the audience asks Rand a question.
*  Fifteen years ago, I was impressed with your books and I sort of felt that your philosophy
*  was proper.
*  Today, however, I'm more educated and I find that if a company...
*  This is what I don't answer.
*  Wait a minute.
*  You haven't heard the question yet.
*  And when Rand responds...
*  She's already estimated her position and my work incidentally displaying the quality of
*  her brain.
*  If she says today she is more educated...
*  I am more educated now than I was 15 years ago when I was in high school before I went
*  to college and before I read the newspaper.
*  She is exceptionally dismissive of this woman.
*  Let her make a point.
*  It's very basic.
*  If a company is permitted to do what it wants to do, like IT...
*  Donahue tries to create some space for this audience member to speak, but...
*  Can we encourage you to make a contribution to that observation?
*  I will not answer anyone who is impolite, but to show you...
*  She wasn't impolite.
*  I do not sanction impoliteness and I am not the victim of hippies.
*  Rand's disdain completely overpowers everything.
*  If anyone else wants to ask the same question politely, I'll be delighted to answer.
*  There was nothing impolite.
*  You are punishing this woman for the vigor and energy that she brought to the dialogue.
*  And that's not fair to her.
*  This is the kind of woman we spend a long time trying to attract to our television audience.
*  And what I realized was that this was a moment that could only happen on Donahue.
*  It was a moment that I don't think ever would have happened if it were just Donahue
*  and Ayn Rand sitting on stage talking to one another.
*  I don't think Rand would have been that rude to this powerful TV host.
*  She would only act that way toward an ordinary person.
*  So what you get because of this complicated ecosystem that Donahue has created
*  is this totally unfiltered version of this intellectual titan.
*  And it's pretty ugly.
*  And while you're watching this happen, you start to wonder what truly animates Ayn Rand.
*  Is it this ruthless, uncompromising philosophy at the center of her bestselling books?
*  Or is it maybe that she just doesn't like other people?
*  Whatever was really going on here, it is revealing, it is messy, it is unexpected,
*  and it is fantastic television.
*  And all of it was orchestrated by this guy, Philip John Donahue, whose biography in no way prepares
*  you for this kaleidoscopic, boundary-pushing national conversation that he invited the
*  country to have day after day for 30 years.
*  And we'll be back in just a moment.
*  So who was Phil Donahue?
*  You know, my father always had a job.
*  I was born in 1935.
*  So his unemployment preceded my birth.
*  He felt the depression.
*  Oh, yes, my parents did.
*  Absolutely.
*  He was born six years after the Great Depression into an Irish Catholic family in Cleveland.
*  His dad sold furniture.
*  His mom sold shoes.
*  I worked for the nuns for 50 cents an hour when I was 10, 12 years old, you know, switching.
*  He went to a Catholic day school and later a Catholic college.
*  And in his telling, Catholicism was the scaffolding for his entire way of thinking.
*  The guy, I had 16 years of Catholic education.
*  You know, I had most of the answers.
*  Who made me?
*  God made me.
*  Why did God make me?
*  I mean, it was, I knew the answers to the toughest questions.
*  And then in the 60s, you know, everything started to fall apart.
*  And then he starts to rethink everything, especially his relationship with the church.
*  We began to realize that we really did have two Americas, a black one and a white one.
*  And the liberal guilt, my conscience began to manifest itself and I began to
*  question the answers that had been given.
*  And suddenly, my mind was racing, I guess, I'd have to say.
*  He gets really mad at his local diocese, which is building a fancy new cathedral where he thinks
*  it's least needed.
*  Who else would spend a million dollars on a building that is used about four and a half hours a week?
*  And he begs the church instead to put that money into inner city Catholic schools.
*  And suddenly we were saying, hold it, hold it.
*  Now we've been listening to you.
*  Now you listen to us.
*  But the church leaders ignore him.
*  The church was built at a cost of a million dollars, including a bell tower.
*  It is centrally air conditioned.
*  It stands today in Centerville, Ohio, I think, as a very hard, cold monument to what churches
*  are everywhere, almost always dark and empty.
*  And when he loses that battle to the church, the church loses him.
*  So by the time he enters broadcasting, Donahue strongly identifies with the powerless.
*  Don't talk about subsidizing the farmer, the man that printed the box
*  made more than the man that grew the corn.
*  Farmers.
*  In our lifetime, we've traveled on in a corridor of fear.
*  Gay men.
*  Fear of employers finding out fear of fellow employees, fear of landlords, fear of the
*  family.
*  But we finally have decided at our respective ages to put that aside and to tell the world
*  about our relationship and that we're very proud of it.
*  Black women.
*  You're not surprised that there's not a greater participation of women of color in the women's
*  movement.
*  And there are huge numbers of women of color involved in the women's movement.
*  It's just that we don't get the media.
*  This is a real treat for us.
*  And sees his job as challenging the rich and the powerful.
*  Why couldn't the millions of men, women and children who are Arab and who find themselves
*  in this desperate conflict and look around wondering where peace will be?
*  Why can't they be angry with you for your characterization of them, your roundhouse
*  up?
*  That sensibility is a through line across every episode of the show.
*  And you really see it in an interview that he did in 1987.
*  Are you 40?
*  I'm 41.
*  41.
*  With a young Donald Trump.
*  You're a star, Mr. Trump, and you're a businessman.
*  And you do not run away from publicity.
*  Trump is flying high.
*  His first book, The Art of the Deal, has just come out.
*  But Donahue keeps bringing the conversation back to the little guy.
*  He wants to point it down to the street, not up at Trump's penthouse and Trump Tower.
*  I didn't like it because it wasn't fact, and I decided to fight it.
*  And at one point, Donahue reads from a passage in Trump's book.
*  The fact was that we did rent to blacks in our buildings.
*  What we didn't do was rent to welfare cases, white or black.
*  In which Trump says that he would never rent a unit in one of his buildings to anybody
*  on welfare.
*  I watched what happened when the government came after Samuel LeFranc, another builder,
*  and he caved in and started taking welfare cases.
*  They virtually ruined his building.
*  Donahue, at this moment, dramatically rubs his hands together, as if preparing to go
*  into battle.
*  Isn't that, aren't you pretty close here to looking like an insensitive guy from atop
*  your Trump Tower, looking down on the woman rank over the vast holdings of your own empire?
*  Shouldn't we have just a little more understanding from a man of your influence and wealth on
*  the issue of making New York livable for all of us, safety on the subway, these kind of
*  Then we can't continue to give you guys these big tax breaks.
*  And that would go for.
*  And Trump does what we all now know to be his go to move when somebody tries to hold
*  him accountable.
*  So when everybody else in the city gets it, but Donald Trump, when Koch and the administration
*  tries to stop Donald Trump, and I don't say give me the tax breaks, I say don't give
*  everyone else the tax breaks.
*  He makes himself the victim.
*  I'm honest.
*  Hey, I'm not running for anything.
*  I'm not running for office.
*  I don't have to lie in a book.
*  I want to tell the facts.
*  Okay.
*  And toward the end of the episode, as always, you keep saying you're not running for
*  office, but why don't you?
*  The most prescient questions come from the women in the audience.
*  No, I wouldn't want to run for mayor of New York.
*  I'd like to see somebody talented do that, but I really have no intention of running
*  for me.
*  Thank you.
*  But you definitely are a political person, whether you run for office by what everything
*  that you say and do points in that direction.
*  You know what it is?
*  I don't like being taken advantage of.
*  Okay.
*  They saw Trump's future even before Trump did.
*  By the late 1980s, the Phil Donahue show was a bona fide hit.
*  It's syndicated across the country and the wait time for tickets to be in his studio
*  audience is an astonishing 18 months.
*  And this success opens up an entirely new genre of TV.
*  Copycats are popping up across the daytime schedule.
*  Sounds scary.
*  Well, the mothers on today's show say they are terrified of their own children.
*  Sally Jesse Raphael, Maury Povich.
*  You are not.
*  Geraldo Rivera, Jerry Springer.
*  You have a secret to tell them.
*  Yes.
*  And your secret is?
*  I'm a man, Jerry.
*  And most important of all,
*  Oprah.
*  Who told Donahue that
*  if it wasn't for Phil Donahue, there would never have been an Oprah show.
*  Her career would not have been possible if it weren't for him.
*  So this is a full, full, full circle.
*  Well, we've watched Oprah as you've soared.
*  There is no other single human being who has done with this media what Oprah has done.
*  My Cubs cap is off to you.
*  Oprah aside, the shows that followed Donahue, his illegitimate children, as he called them,
*  were nowhere near as thoughtful as his show was.
*  But Donahue steadfastly refused to criticize them, and he was asked to criticize them all the time.
*  You talked about it being a naughty show, but it is a far cry from what you see today on
*  television. Are you comfortable with where it's gone?
*  Well, you know, it's hard for me to be uncomfortable with what's happening on television today because
*  I've been preached to so much in the 29 years I was on the air.
*  I mean, there were viewers who got messages from God to get me off the air.
*  There were people who felt that the United States of America was going to hell,
*  and Phil Donahue was leading it there with atheists and doing shows like the march on
*  Skokie by Nazis. We had Nazis on our program.
*  So when people say, what do I think of this or that program, I'm a little bit hesitant.
*  I don't want to, I feel that the show is not worthy of consideration will fall of their own weight.
*  We don't want a bunch of white men, and that's usually what it winds up being behind closed
*  doors deciding what you and I should see. Because for him, TV belonged in the hands
*  of the viewer. Good, bad, smart, stupid, Ayn Rand or in-studio surprise paternity tests.
*  They all had their place because the alternative was undemocratic.
*  And one of the main bulwarks against somebody assuming power who knows what's good for you
*  is a free press and unfettered speech by the citizenry, allowing all of us to be heard.
*  We were looking for a cacophony of voices, not a well-trained choir.
*  But eventually, after three decades, that cacophony overtook Donahue. The viewers were voting and they
*  were no longer voting for him. And his show ended its run in 1996. He briefly tried to make
*  a comeback in the early 2000s with a reboot of a Donahue show on MSNBC.
*  The anti-war movement is heating up. But all of his anti-establishment instincts
*  ran up against the cruel realities of cable news after the September 11th terror attacks.
*  At a time when almost everybody else in TV news seemed to be beating the drums of war,
*  Donahue very loudly questioned the coming U.S. invasion of Iraq.
*  This is an email from Michael. I'm 17. I'm the person the Bush administration wants to hold
*  a rifle and go off and kill Iraqis. I would like to know why. Is that too much to ask?
*  And to hear him tell it, his bosses at MSNBC were not interested in a cacophony of voices.
*  They wanted a well-trained choir. It really is funny almost when you look back on how
*  how the management was just frozen by the anti-war voice. We were scolds. We weren't
*  we weren't patriotic. American people disagreed with us. And we weren't good for business.
*  And his show was canceled after just seven months.
*  As it happens, the year he went off the air for good was the year that I began my career in
*  journalism. And when I think about Phil Donahue now and I try to answer that question of why I
*  was always so drawn to his work, it's all right there in his show. He respected his audience.
*  He never talked down to them. He sought out nuance wherever he could find it.
*  He forced us way outside our comfort zones. And he challenged us to see ourselves
*  and our neighbors in a new and more generous light.
*  A few months before Donahue died back in May, President Biden invited him to the White House
*  to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest civilian honor.
*  And before social media and clickbait news, Phil Donahue broadcast the power of personal
*  stories and living rooms all across America. He helped change hearts and minds through honest
*  and open dialogue. Over the course of a defining career in television and through thousands of
*  daily conversations, Phil Donahue steered the nation's discourse and spoke to our better angels.
*  I wish you were still speaking there, pal. And for once, Phil Donahue, now seated in a wheelchair,
*  didn't say a word.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to another day.
*  Madam Vice President, Governor Walz, thank you so much for sitting down with me.
*  In her first extended interview since becoming the Democratic nominee,
*  Vice President Kamala Harris, joined by her running mate, Tim Walz, was pushed by CNN to explain
*  positions she had taken during her first run for president in 2020, but has since backed away from,
*  including banning fracking and decriminalizing illegal border crossings.
*  There was a debate you raised your hand when asked whether or not the border should be
*  decriminalized. Do you still believe that? I believe there should be consequence. We have laws
*  that have to be followed and enforced that address and deal with people who cross our
*  border illegally. And there should be consequences. Harris insisted that despite shifting stances on
*  specific policies, her core beliefs have remained the same. How should voters look at some of the
*  changes that you've made in your policy? Is it because you have more experience now and you've
*  learned more about the information? Is it because you were running for president in a Democratic
*  primary? And should they feel comfortable and confident that what you're saying now is going
*  to be your policy moving forward? Dana, I think the most important and most significant aspect
*  of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed.
*  And you have.
