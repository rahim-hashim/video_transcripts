# What the record breaking number of early voters can tell us about the election
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTKzcTf4lA)
*  This is the very first time on a roundtable that we can really talk about early voting
*  because we now have hard numbers.
*  They're starting to come in because people are actually early voting.
*  We got our first real batch of those numbers on Tuesday night out of Georgia, and the numbers
*  were pretty eye-popping.
*  Let me just summarize them for you.
*  By the end of Tuesday, more than 300,000 voters in Georgia had cast ballots, which basically
*  means more than twice as many people voted early this year.
*  I think that tells us something, but what does it tell us?
*  What does that mean?
*  I mean, Michael, you know.
*  How do you add a record-shattering first day early voting?
*  I understand we are in a neck-and-neck race, razor-tight margins, margin-to-error every
*  state, as you said, and we are all desperate for things to grab onto that will tell us
*  where it's going.
*  You're about to tell me that the first day doesn't matter.
*  I mean, there's a lot more days, right?
*  We don't know what's going to happen to all these other days.
*  We don't necessarily know who those people are who are voting.
*  We don't know how they voted.
*  Well, we know, historic patterns tell us, that early voting and mail-in voting tends
*  to trend significantly democratic.
*  Yes.
*  However, our big marker on mail-in voting is 2020, which, if you may recall...
*  Was anomalous.
*  I believe you were in your closet studio then.
*  We were not in this beautiful place.
*  It's not like you can glean that much data from that experience.
*  So I just think let's not...
*  You're caveating it.
*  Let's not overdo it.
*  I have to imagine it tells us something about Democratic Party energy in a state like Georgia,
*  because I'm just thinking back four years ago, Joe Biden won that state over Donald
*  Trump.
*  If that number is twice as big this year, I just wonder if that starts to tell us something
*  about the way we should be thinking about Georgia, a state that for the longest time
*  we thought of as Trump's to lose.
*  I think it tells us about the total amount of energy versus the Democratic or Republican
*  energy, because the Republican Party has been trying to get voters to vote early.
*  They have been scolding voters, despite what Donald Trump said in 2020, they've been pushing.
*  And there's a really sort of mechanical reason why this matters, which is the most organized
*  campaigns have a list of voters that they would like to get to the polls, right?
*  And for those states that say who actually has voted, they can cross them off the list
*  so you don't knock on their door again.
*  You don't send them another mailer.
*  You save money.
*  Your targeting becomes more sophisticated.
*  It's an advantage for the more organized campaigns to make sure they focus on the lower propensity
*  voters that they think is going to make the difference.
*  And can't we all just find something to celebrate in the fact that people are voting?
*  It's great.
*  People are voting.
*  We still have a democracy.
*  I mean, Trump isn't just a unifying thing for the Democrats.
*  He has brought more people out to vote.
*  We have said voting records since he got into office, we shatter record after record for
*  turnout.
*  So people are more engaged in the process of voting than they were before.
