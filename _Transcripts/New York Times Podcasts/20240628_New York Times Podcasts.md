# A Brutal Debate for Biden
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nSXbQqF5Ls)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily.
*  Today, in the first debate of the 2024 president's, Joe Biden hoped to make the case that Donald
*  Trump was unfit to return to the White House. Instead, Biden's weak performance deepened
*  doubts about his own fitness for the job.
*  My colleague, Astead Herndon, a political reporter and host of The Run-Up, explains
*  what happened.
*  It's Friday, June 28th.
*  Astead, good evening, almost good morning. By the time we're done talking, it is definitely
*  going to be Friday morning. Thank you for joining us at what is clearly a very tender
*  hour.
*  No, thank you for having me.
*  Okay. This was always going to be a historic debate. Two single term presidents debating
*  each other for a chance at a second term, both choosing to opt out of the traditional
*  presidential commission authorized debates. We've never had any of this before, but that's
*  not I would wager what people are going to remember about this debate. I suspect they're
*  going to remember just how much one of these candidates openly struggled, struggled mightily
*  on the biggest possible stage.
*  Yeah. I mean, there were some things I was expecting for tonight's debate. Bitter insults,
*  an incumbent defending a policy record, a challenger really attacking it. But one thing
*  I didn't expect was for President Biden to kind of live up to the caricature of him that
*  has been really been created over the last six months by Republicans. In the first 10
*  minutes, he was not even just a poor debater. He seems like a struggling old man in a way
*  that I think for a lot of people was alarming, not even just in a political sense, but in
*  a personal sense. And I think then the low bar that had been created for him for tonight's
*  performance, it immediately raised alarm flags that he was not even clearing it.
*  Well, let's talk about what both Biden and Trump were trying to do in this debate before
*  we return to the question of how Biden did or didn't do and how Trump did or didn't
*  do tonight. You know, for Trump, there is an electoral opening right now for him to
*  really create a coalition that's unique for a Republican candidate. If you believe the
*  polling or the kind of trend lines that we have seen in polling over the last six months,
*  Donald Trump is not winning back the kind of traditional Republicans he's lost over
*  the last four years. He's winning over people who were considered more traditionally democratic
*  groups or just more disaffected voters in general, younger people, people of color,
*  low income folks, black folks. There has been a kind of growth among those margins that's
*  provided Trump with this ability to say that if he can put that together in November, there's
*  a real unique path for him to beat Joe Biden. But that path requires a candidate who's
*  kind of speaking in more disciplined, controlled tones that I think we're used to Trump talking.
*  And the Trump campaign was eager to put that best foot forward. Now on the Biden side,
*  they have a fundamental problem, which is that the majority of Americans think the president
*  is too old to serve. And the prospect of an 86 year old Joe Biden at the end of a second
*  term, frankly freaks folks out. And the Biden campaign's response to that problem has
*  been frankly to diminish it, but also say to watch him. And the idea was that if they
*  had an earlier debate before the conventions and before the race really kicked off, they
*  can put some of those concerns to bed as we saw him slightly do at the State of the Union
*  earlier this year. But as we just talked about, Biden provided his party no reassurance
*  tonight.
*  Okay, well, take us into the meat of this debate and let's explore why this night ended
*  up being so problematic for Biden. And let's try to understand whether Trump did achieve
*  his goal of being the kind of candidate who can assemble this theoretical broad coalition.
*  Well, let me set the scene.
*  We're live from Georgia, a key battleground state in the race for the White House.
*  Good evening, I'm Dana Bash, anchor of CNN's...
*  Dana Bash and Jake Taffer, the moderators, introduced both candidates.
*  Now, please welcome the 46th president of the United States, Joe Biden.
*  And when Biden walked onto the stage, I mean, it's generous to call it a walk.
*  He frankly shuffled in a way that was only a visual reminder of the advanced age of this
*  president.
*  Gentlemen, thanks so much for being here.
*  Let's begin the debate and let's start with the issue that voters consistently say is
*  their top concern, the economy.
*  And within the first couple answers, what do you say to voters who feel they are worse
*  off under your presidency than they were under President Trump?
*  We got to take a look at what I was left when I became president, when Mr. Trump left me.
*  The immediate thing that was noticeable was not about what he was saying, but about how
*  he sounded.
*  The economy collapsed.
*  There were no jobs.
*  Unemployment rate rose to 15 percent.
*  Biden's voice was really raspy.
*  We created 15,000 new jobs and we brought out another position where...
*  It sounded as if he needed to clear his throat.
*  He was talking really softly.
*  There's more to be done.
*  Working class people are still in trouble.
*  And it made his first couple answers almost incoherent.
*  What I'm going to do is fix the tax system.
*  For example, we have a thousand billionaires in America.
*  I mean, billionaires in America.
*  And what's happening?
*  And then we got to one answer that was literally incoherent.
*  Making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I've
*  been able to do with the COVID, excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do
*  with. Look, if we finally beat Medicare.
*  Thank you, President Biden, President Trump.
*  And eventually ended up trailing off such that it became clear that this was not someone
*  who was fully in command of their presence at the moment.
*  And that really set the tone for Biden's performance throughout the whole debate.
*  Right. This was the moment, if we're being honest, where everyone in politics and political
*  journalism's phones just started exploding with text messages, all of them saying some
*  version of, oh, gosh, this debate is going really quite badly for President Biden.
*  And I said to your point about what he was seeking to do and the assurances he was trying
*  to give people in his party and beyond his party, he was not giving those assurances
*  at all. Yeah.
*  Let me read you some live text messages I got from Democrats in those first 10 minutes.
*  One says, I think you have to question seriously whether he can even make it to the end of
*  this night. Another says, man, this just doesn't feel good to watch.
*  I mean, it was an immediate sense of panic that was spreading among the party.
*  And I think it's because, you know, typically these debates have an air of optics and
*  showmanship. But for Biden and his kind of political challenge, it was really about that
*  sense of energy and about that sense of command of stage because the question of age has
*  been so circling around his candidacy.
*  And so for him to immediately come out with a both presentation and an answer that was
*  frankly not substantive and hard to follow, it sent the concerns to the roof.
*  I mean, things went from zero to 100 very fast, partially because I think that's what
*  people were coming in seeing as a baseline for him.
*  And he very immediately stumbled.
*  I would make an analogy to like an Olympic hurdler, right, where at the first hurdle,
*  he fell. Donald Trump, on the other hand, doesn't seem to have lost his edge.
*  That becomes very clear from the beginning of the debate and instead is displaying his
*  usual swagger as well as his usual challenges with the facts.
*  Yeah, absolutely. To the extent that Donald Trump can be focused on policy, he came out
*  in that mode today.
*  We're the greatest economy in the history of our country and we have never done so well.
*  Everybody was amazed by it.
*  Other countries were copying us.
*  We got hit with COVID.
*  We know that the campaign really wants to focus on three things, inflation, immigration
*  and crime.
*  The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounce back jobs, a bounce back
*  from the COVID.
*  And you could see Trump really returning to those in the early kind of 10, 15 minutes.
*  He inherited almost no inflation and it stayed that way for 14 months.
*  And then it blew up under his leadership because they spent money like a bunch of people
*  that didn't know what they were doing.
*  And they repeatedly tied Biden to rising prices and tried to frame the economy that he
*  stewarded as president as significantly better than the one that we are experiencing now.
*  Migrant crime.
*  I call it Biden migrant crime.
*  They're killing our citizens at a level that we've never seen before.
*  He framed the country as safer four years ago than what we're experiencing now.
*  And it's a shame what's happened to our country in the last four years is not to
*  be believed.
*  You could see him trying to follow through on the kind of classic premise of a re-election
*  campaign where the challenger really tries to ask the question, are you better off than
*  you were four years ago?
*  Mm-hmm.
*  And so we got the Donald Trump version of that tonight, but we should be clear it's
*  infused with a lot of his usual set of falsehoods as we have come to expect from him.
*  And what struck me was for all the exaggerations and some of the falsehoods in what Trump was
*  saying, the contrast between his swagger and his presentation and Biden's became the most
*  pronounced part of this back and forth.
*  Yeah, I think you're right that Trump sounded and felt a little more, dare we say, presidential
*  than Biden in those first 10 minutes.
*  But the bar was on the floor because the president came out with such, I think, a shocking
*  level of incoherence that it made Donald Trump, the Donald Trump we have seen spew falsehoods,
*  conspiracies, unhingedness at every turn, it made him seem like the person who kind
*  of had their ducks in a row.
*  There are 40% fewer people coming across the border illegally.
*  That's better than when he left office.
*  And in a kind of crystallizing moment of this interaction, I'm going to continue to move
*  until we get the total ban on the total initiative relative to what we're going to do with more
*  border patrol and more asylum officers.
*  After one of Biden's more meandering answers, Trump responds with a quip that really said
*  what everyone was thinking.
*  President Trump, I really don't know what he said at the end of this sentence.
*  I don't think he knows what he said either.
*  Saying that I don't know what Biden said at the end of the sentence, and I don't know
*  if he does either.
*  This is the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.
*  It feels like a strong topic for Biden in this part of the debate was going to be abortion.
*  Which returned the issue of abortion to the states.
*  And the moderators bring it up.
*  And it felt like low hanging fruit, an opportunity for Biden to blame Trump for the fall of
*  Roe v. Wade and score some real points on the board.
*  But it didn't feel like that's what happened.
*  No, it didn't.
*  And I think that speaks to the point that came through during this debate.
*  That was consistently not the message.
*  It was the messenger.
*  Abortion has been a politically potent issue for Democrats and something that folks have
*  been looking for Biden to speak to directly.
*  Do you support any legal limits on how late a woman should be able to terminate a pregnancy?
*  I support Roe v. Wade.
*  And he kind of botched that framing.
*  Which had three trimesters.
*  The first time is between the woman and the doctor.
*  Second time is between the doctor and an extreme situation.
*  The third time is between the doctor, I mean, between the woman and the state.
*  He was trying to seemingly make an analogy about trimesters that didn't really come
*  through very clearly.
*  And so that, I think, was a moment where when the moderator brought it up,
*  you would feel Democrats think, OK, this is something that might play better for us
*  than the economy or immigration.
*  But like a lot of things in this debate, Biden just didn't seem to put it together that well.
*  Eventually, in this first half of the debate, things start to get a bit more personal.
*  They start to get a bit nastier between these two candidates who clearly do not like each
*  other at all.
*  And interestingly, given your framing of, you know, would Trump moderate some of his
*  excesses, it was Biden who went there first.
*  Yeah, it was.
*  And, you know, we should put the background here.
*  There was previous reporting that Donald Trump had called fallen soldiers suckers and
*  losers while touring a military gravesite.
*  I went to the World War II cemetery, World War I cemetery, he refused to go to.
*  He was standing with his four-star general and he told me, he said, I don't want to go
*  in there because they're a bunch of losers and suckers.
*  And that's what Biden was referring to, framing Trump as someone who is consistently
*  disrespected, veterans.
*  We're also in a situation where we have great respect for veterans.
*  My son spent a year in Iraq.
*  But Biden lands on saying, my son was not a loser, was not a sucker.
*  And then looks to Trump and says, you're the sucker, you're the loser.
*  You're the sucker, you're the loser.
*  Mm hmm.
*  And I thought for me, this reflected the Biden campaign strategy of wanting to draw Trump
*  out to kind of bring out, let's say, more chaotic version of him that was less stuck
*  to the policy script.
*  And so I was looking at this moment to see, OK, how was Trump going to respond to this?
*  First of all, that was a made up quote, suckers and losers.
*  They made it up.
*  It was in a third rate magazine that's failing.
*  Like many of these.
*  He denied kind of making the suckers and losers remark about dead soldiers.
*  But he didn't kind of respond on the personal level in which Biden was trying to draw him out to.
*  It was made up by him, just like Russia, Russia, Russia was made up.
*  Just like he reframed the conversation about commander in chief to be about the kind of
*  global instability that has happened under Biden's watch.
*  I tell you what happened.
*  He was so bad with Afghanistan.
*  It was such a horrible embarrassment.
*  Most embarrassing.
*  This is when he mentions the kind of Afghanistan withdrawal.
*  We lost 13 beautiful soldiers and 38 soldiers were obliterated.
*  And by the way, we left.
*  It kind of starts framing the world as more generally unsafe under Biden than it was under Trump.
*  That's why you had no terror at all during my administration.
*  This place, the whole world is blowing up under him.
*  Now, certainly that's done in a kind of Trumpian way, but it was an example of him,
*  at least at that moment, not really meeting Biden in the mud and trying to stay focused
*  on what I think was his campaign's goal in this night, which was to present him as someone making
*  a policy first challenge to Biden rather than a personal one.
*  Right.
*  And what seems to happen for the next 10 or 15 minutes in the debate is that Biden keeps
*  trying to get under Trump's skin and really make the case that there's nothing about him
*  that makes him fit to be president.
*  Yeah.
*  You could feel President Biden trying to draw out the more crazy, chaotic side of Donald Trump.
*  Some of the attacks were lighter.
*  And now he says that he loses again such a whiner that he is that it could be a blood bath.
*  Things like calling him a whiner, for example.
*  For doing a whole range of things of having sex with a porn star.
*  At one point, he pointed out the allegations that Donald Trump had sex with a porn star
*  while his wife was pregnant.
*  You have the morals of an alley cat.
*  And at another point.
*  The only person on this stage is a convicted felon is the man I'm looking at right now.
*  He mentioned the most serious, I think, of the political allegations,
*  which is the idea that Donald Trump has convicted felon is unfit to be president.
*  And you could see Trump physically wince when the words felon were said out loud,
*  which I think is reflective to just how much that label really stings him.
*  I'm going to give you a minute, President Trump, for a follow-up question I have.
*  After a jury convicted you of 34 felonies last month, you said if re-elected, you would, quote,
*  have every right to go after, unquote, your political opponents.
*  You just talked about members of the select committee on January 6 going to jail.
*  Your main political opponent is standing on stage with you tonight.
*  Can you clarify exactly what it means about you feeling you have every right to go after
*  your political opponents?
*  When he talks about January 6, it becomes very clear that he's trying to obfuscate his own role.
*  And let me tell you about January 6.
*  Trump goes into a soliloquy about, oh, January 6.
*  We were energy independent.
*  On January 6, we had the lowest taxes ever.
*  We had the lowest regulations ever.
*  Completely actually diverting the question that was at hand,
*  which is did Donald Trump encourage a mob that struck at the heart of democracy?
*  You have 80 seconds left.
*  My question was, what do you say to those voters who believe that you violated your
*  constitutional oath through your actions and inaction on January 6, 2021,
*  and worry that you'll do it again?
*  Well, I didn't say that to anybody.
*  I said peacefully and patriotically.
*  And Nancy Pelosi, if you just want something to do with it.
*  And so that's the kind of push and pull that we were seeing play out on the stage,
*  which is that certainly Trump was engaging in his normal level of kind of dodges and falsehoods,
*  but it was coming off, I think, more successfully than some expected,
*  partially because Biden was just ineffective in landing some of those attacks.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So instead, the second half of the debate starts with a question that feels quite central to what
*  you described as Trump's strategy of trying to build this bigger coalition that exists in theory,
*  that he's trying to make real in November.
*  And it's a question the moderators ask of Biden and why he seems to have disappointed Black America.
*  Yeah, and you're right.
*  Biden knows that Black voters are an overwhelmingly democratic constituency.
*  And theoretically, if those folks came home to support him,
*  it wouldn't be much harder to see the path for Donald Trump's victory.
*  What do you say to Black voters who are disappointed with the progress so far?
*  And so he tries to give a little two-part answer here.
*  I say I don't blame them for being disappointed. Inflation is still hurting them badly.
*  For example, I provided for the idea that any Black family,
*  first-time homebuyers should get a $10,000 tax credit.
*  Both acknowledging that Black voters are right to feel some disappointment in Democrats,
*  while also pointing to some things his administration has done to provide support
*  for those communities.
*  He's blaming inflation. And he's right, it's been very bad.
*  He caused the inflation and it's killing Black families.
*  And you hear Trump saying that none of those things are mattering
*  because inflation is hurting Black communities more.
*  His big kill on the Black people is the millions of people that he's allowed to come in through
*  the border. They're taking Black jobs now.
*  And also that immigration is taking what Trump dubs, quote, unquote, Black jobs.
*  Now, I'm not exactly sure what Black jobs are, but we could guess that Trump here is trying to mean
*  that an influx of immigration has hurt specifically Black communities more than other ones.
*  And you haven't seen it yet, but you're going to see something that's going to be
*  the worst in our history.
*  Thank you.
*  That's again Trump hitting that three-pong message in one.
*  Inflation, immigration, and crime.
*  And those things are all wrapped up in that answer.
*  And it's really the pitch that Trump is giving to Black voters.
*  So this is Trump executing on the strategy that you mentioned him wanting to execute on
*  in this debate, which is finding a way of appealing to this group of voters, traditionally
*  Democratic through and through, who are intrigued by him and might come to him in this election.
*  He is threading a complicated needle in seeking their votes.
*  He's seeming to succeed a bit.
*  Yes and no, because I also think this answer was a real reminder of how Donald Trump is
*  not a natural communicator on these issues.
*  And frankly, often sounds like an unhinged man himself, whether it be Black jobs, quote,
*  unquote, or in his next answer about climate change.
*  There were some moments in this debate that definitely reminded us of the Donald Trump
*  who lost four years ago, frankly, because most of the country did find him unacceptable.
*  Will you take any action as president to slow the climate crisis?
*  Let me just go back to what he said about the police.
*  When asked about climate change, he doesn't answer the question at all.
*  President Trump, will you take any action as president to slow the climate crisis?
*  And then after a follow up by the moderators, he goes on a kind of classic Trump soliloquy.
*  So I want absolutely immaculate clean water.
*  About how I want absolutely immaculate clean water.
*  I want absolutely clean air.
*  And we had it.
*  We had H2O.
*  We had the best numbers ever.
*  How we have the best H2O.
*  It's the Trump of the memes that frankly, I think, gets him further away from who he
*  wants to be if he's going to pass his own kind of standard in terms of reaching different
*  folks for November.
*  Right.
*  What kept striking me in this second half, as in this climate change exchange, is just
*  how consistently Trump is not answering the questions that the moderators are asking him.
*  Oh, absolutely.
*  Whether it be questions about child care, Medicare, whether it's questions about opioids.
*  These are core issues people cared about.
*  And Trump almost never responded to the moderators direct questions about those things.
*  He almost always stayed in those three buckets that were clearly his focus to attack Biden.
*  Economy, immigration, crime.
*  It's around here that the moderators turn to a question that has been on everyone's
*  mind at this point all night, which is the candidates age.
*  And they start with Biden, whose age has been quite present in this debate.
*  So tell us how that unfolds.
*  Yeah, the moderators put to the candidates directly the question about whether these
*  are people who even physically or mentally can lead the country for the next four years.
*  And Biden, I have to say, didn't inspire much confidence.
*  Well, first of all, I spent half my career being criticized, being the youngest person.
*  He starts off by saying he spent half his career being criticized for how young he was.
*  And then he goes on to say that you should judge him for the job that he's done in office.
*  Look at what I've done.
*  Look how I've turned around in the horrible situation he left me.
*  He's saying to judge him by what he did rather than how old he is.
*  The problem is that the first part of the debate was so defined by how inarticulate he was
*  that the question of age had been subtly already answered and he had flunked that test.
*  Now, Trump responds in a maybe even more ridiculous fashion.
*  What do you say to voters who have concerns about your capabilities to serve?
*  Well, I took two tests, cognitive tests.
*  I aced them, both of them, as you know.
*  Talking about the mental acuity test that he has taken.
*  I just won two club championships, not even senior, two regular club championships.
*  And focusing on his own golf game, saying that he can hit a ball 50 yards
*  and that that's an example of how he feels like in physical good shape,
*  you know, akin to 25 and 30 years ago.
*  Right. And this is when we enter the strangest moment I have to think in presidential debate
*  history, two rather old men wrangling over who has the better golf game.
*  Look, I'd be happy to have a driving contest with him.
*  I got my handicap, which when I was vice president, down to a six.
*  But by the way, I told you before, I'm happy to play golf if you carry your own bag.
*  Think you can do it?
*  It was a six handicap of all.
*  I have to say, like, this moment personally kind of bummed me.
*  There was a one minute period where the two options to leading the country
*  were arguing over their golf handicaps.
*  Something about the debate about whose golf handicap was better felt like a distillation
*  of the failure of this debate to really provide the American people with the options
*  and the kind of serious policy discussion that the office warns.
*  I said, by the end of this 90 minute debate, it really felt like the consuming question
*  that it produced wasn't so much about whether Donald Trump was going to assemble
*  a coalition that won him the presidency.
*  The burning question seemed to be around President Biden and his weak performance.
*  And so I want to make sure we end there with an understanding of what now happens
*  because of how Joe Biden performed and what it's going to mean for the rest of the race.
*  Yeah, I had come into the debate thinking that the onus was on Donald Trump to prove himself
*  as a disciplined challenger who could take what was a polling possibility of a broad coalition
*  and make it real.
*  But frankly, that belief was based on the assumption that Joe Biden would clear the baseline
*  of coherence that would make the age question at least neutralized for the night.
*  But by the end of the night, it became clear that that wasn't where the conversation would be.
*  I think that Joe Biden's performance was frankly so disastrous that a Democratic Party freak out
*  that has been bubbling under a lid for months now has now exploded into the open to the point
*  where you have his former communications director on television saying that was a
*  poor performance.
*  Right, Kate Bennington.
*  That struck me too.
*  His former White House communications director went on TV and said that was a disappointing
*  debate performance from President Biden.
*  Something Democratic communications directors don't normally say on the record moments
*  after a debate ends.
*  Absolutely.
*  I mean, also, I saw an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris and Anderson Cooper
*  immediately after the debate where the vice president, the cheerleader in chief for the
*  president, said very explicitly that she would not deny he had a rough start but believes that
*  he got better at the end and saying the last 90 minutes does not erase the last three and a half
*  years of real acknowledgement of the hole that Biden frankly put himself in throughout tonight's
*  debate.
*  But I got to say, as someone who has dedicated the last year and a half to asking a lot of
*  Democrats questions about how we arrived at an 81 year old president running for reelection,
*  they have consistently dismissed the overwhelming evidence that most Americans thought Biden was
*  too old to run for a second term.
*  I brought that question to them at the DNC as they were making his path to the nomination
*  easier.
*  And the answer that frankly we got at the time was that Donald Trump will be so inherently
*  invalid.
*  None of that would matter.
*  But there was no evidence to support that.
*  That was their own belief that that would just change.
*  And then tonight, not only did Donald Trump not seem like someone who was completely unfit for the
*  office of president, but that Biden was the memed version of himself, the incoherent falling off a
*  bike, TikTok caricature of himself.
*  And I think now that Democrats are openly panicking about what Biden should do next, about
*  what the party should do next, they have a lot fewer options at their disposal.
*  Right.
*  There is really no plan B because of how Democratic leaders handled this situation for so long.
*  Yes.
*  There is no plan B because they refused to ask the questions that would even lead to the creation of
*  a plan B in the lead up to this.
*  And so there aren't really clear solutions as to what Democrats should do going forward.
*  And that really, I think, is going to scare a lot of Democrats.
*  Because if you're someone who wants Joe Biden to be president, a lot of those people believe that
*  Donald Trump is a grave danger to this country.
*  And the belief was that Joe Biden was the person uniquely positioned to stop that from happening.
*  Because he had done it four years before.
*  Because he had done it four years ago.
*  But I think what's changed from last night to today is a realization that actually nominating
*  Joe Biden might be the biggest risk for the party and be the very thing that makes a second term of
*  Donald Trump most possible.
*  Well, instead, thank you very much.
*  Thanks for having me.

*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Thursday, the Supreme Court blew up a landmark legal settlement between prosecutors and Purdue
*  Pharma, the maker of Oxycontin.
*  The settlement would have channeled $6 billion into alleviating the opioid epidemic that Purdue
*  Pharma allegedly played a major role in creating.
*  But the settlement relied on a promise to shield members of the Sackler family that created Purdue
*  Pharma from future lawsuits.
*  And in their five to four ruling, the Supreme Court found that shield to be illegal and invalid.
*  The case was one of several major rulings on Thursday.
*  In another decision, the court temporarily cleared the way for women in Idaho to receive emergency
*  abortions when their health is at risk, despite a state law there all but banning the procedure.
*  In a third decision, the court blocked a federal plan to reduce air pollution that drifts across
*  state lines, a legal defeat for President Biden.
*  A quick reminder about this week's episode of The Interview.
*  David Marchese talks with Eddie Murphy about his long career in comedy, his return to the
*  Beverly Hills franchise, and about what it's like to make his idol, Richard Pryor, laugh.
*  I could have died right there.
*  You could have crashed the plane right there to make Richard laugh.
*  I made Richard laugh for real.
*  He laughed like this.
*  He laughed like this.
