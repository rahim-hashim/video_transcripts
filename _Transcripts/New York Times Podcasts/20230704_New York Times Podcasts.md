# From Serial: ‘The Retrievals’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qQgwtyJVgM)
*  Hi everyone, it's Sabrina.
*  Today as we take a break for the holiday, we're going to do something a little different.
*  We're going to share the first episode of a new show from our colleagues over at Serial
*  Productions.
*  It's hosted by reporter Susan Burton.
*  The series tells the story of something shocking at a Yale fertility clinic.
*  Without saying too much, I can tell you it's a story about healthcare, about women, and
*  about the vulnerabilities of patients.
*  It's also about trust, addiction, accountability, and really whose stories get believed.
*  It's remarkable and harrowing and complicated.
*  Also a heads up to sensitive listeners, parts of the show are graphic, but it's definitely
*  worth a listen.
*  Here's Susan Burton with the first episode of the new series, The Retrievals.
*  The women are seeking fertility treatment for a variety of reasons.
*  They've had a couple miscarriages and they're pushing 40.
*  They don't have fallopian tubes or they need sperm.
*  One woman has a diagnosis that's like a metaphor from feminist sci-fi.
*  A uterus with a single horn like a unicorn.
*  All of them wind up at the fertility clinic at Yale University.
*  A couple of the women choose this clinic because they work at Yale and that's what the Yale
*  health plan covers.
*  Doctors go to Yale on the recommendation of their doctors.
*  But in Connecticut, you don't even really need the recommendation.
*  Yale Medicine.
*  It's a blue chip medical brand.
*  You know Yale is just a huge name and you just think anything that has anything to do
*  with Yale is going to be the best of the best.
*  It's really not close to our house.
*  It's not where I would have gone, but we figured, you know, another doctor from another hospital
*  said this is the best you can get.
*  And you want, of course you want that.
*  To some of the women, the clinic seems to live up to its billing.
*  They like their doctors, feel cared for by them.
*  That man is an angel, one of the women tells me.
*  He is by far the best doctor I've ever had.
*  Others are not happy at the clinic from the start.
*  It's things like feeling like a number or issues with communication.
*  There's a lot to communicate.
*  You don't know how hard fertility treatment is until you get into it.
*  And once you start it in one place, it can be difficult to go somewhere else.
*  So they talk themselves into staying.
*  That's the first thing they go against their instincts and talk themselves into.
*  The women drive to the clinic before work in the morning for blood draws and then wait
*  for the afternoon email from their nurse team.
*  You really have to trust your nurse team, one of the women tells me.
*  At this point she did.
*  The nurse team gives instructions and the women give themselves shots.
*  These shots contain hormones to stimulate the body to produce eggs.
*  A side effect is emotional volatility.
*  The wind is making me cry, one of the women says.
*  But the thing is you have to stay calm.
*  Don't get stressed.
*  It's so stressful trying not to get stressed.
*  One woman uses a fertility meditation app called Expectful.
*  She does her guided meditation on the beach.
*  The app plays the sound of waves while the real waves heave in the background.
*  It's absurd, but so much of this is absurd, including the money.
*  There's all kinds of stuff that's not covered no matter what insurance you have.
*  Meanwhile, your ovaries enlarge and you get so bloated that your abdomen feels like bricks.
*  And then finally, you get to the day you've been waiting for.
*  The day of the first egg retrieval.
*  Which is what it sounds like.
*  The eggs are removed from the body and then fertilized or frozen, depending on what you're
*  doing.
*  How many eggs am I going to get?
*  That is the big question.
*  The more eggs you get, the better your chance of a healthy embryo, a viable pregnancy, a
*  child.
*  The day of the retrieval, the women arrive at the clinic.
*  They check in on different mornings, in different months and calendar years.
*  None of them are here on the same day, but they will come out of the day with the same
*  story.
*  Laura arrives for her retrieval on a weekday morning in January 2020.
*  She checks in and changes into a gown.
*  Two months ago, Laura was diagnosed with breast cancer.
*  A double mastectomy followed.
*  Then an infection and additional surgeries.
*  As soon as she freezes her eggs, she's going to start treatment.
*  It's a lot.
*  Laura is trying to put all of that to the side and just focus on the procedure ahead.
*  I was excited, trying to stay positive.
*  I was just like, having been through so much just the month prior, I was like, this is
*  going to be easy because I had been through so many surgeries and procedures.
*  I was just like, I know what this is like.
*  I know what it's like to be under anesthesia or something and be given medication so you
*  don't feel things.
*  The egg retrieval is a surgical procedure.
*  A long needle is inserted into the vagina, then pierced through the vaginal wall and
*  up into the ovary.
*  Laura has been told in advance what drugs she will be getting during the procedure.
*  Two drugs, fentanyl and another one, mydolazam or Zalam, and I believe that one's to induce
*  sleepiness.
*  Together, these two drugs offer what's often called moderate sedation.
*  Basically, the fentanyl takes away pain and the mydazolam relaxes you.
*  Some people get drowsy with this combination.
*  Others remain alert.
*  The use of fentanyl surprises some of the women.
*  One of them, a public defender, has seen a lot of clients messed up by fentanyl and for
*  a second she's worried.
*  Another woman, Katie, a neuroscientist at Yale, feels a spark of interest.
*  And in fact, you know, just being someone who studies addiction and studies some opioid
*  use disorder and as a curious person, I remember the morning of thinking like, okay, this will
*  be interesting.
*  I've never tried fentanyl before.
*  And I, so I expected to go in and have twilight anesthesia, you know, not full anesthesia,
*  but not feel anything.
*  The women complete the last steps before the procedure.
*  Get an IV, go over some papers.
*  If their partners came back with them, now their partners say goodbye.
*  And then it is time.
*  The women tell what happens next.
*  I walked myself into the procedure room because you get rolled out afterwards, but you don't
*  have any medication in you.
*  You're just kind of hooked up to the IV pole.
*  And I walked into there and you, you know, you get into the, on the chair or table, whatever
*  they call it.
*  And that's from there.
*  They said, you're not going to feel anything.
*  And they, you know, they explained everything that was going to happen.
*  They started the procedure and, you know, I was just sort of taken by surprise, not
*  expecting the excruciating pain and just letting them know that, you know, I don't think the
*  pain medication is doing anything.
*  You know, I can, it really feels like you're stabbing the needle.
*  I felt everything.
*  It's literally your most intimate parts of your body.
*  They're using these long needles and there's also a screen so I can watch what they're
*  doing and I couldn't.
*  I had to try and look away because literally each needle pierce you feel.
*  As we were moving along, it was my blood pressure started going up.
*  I was sweating profusely and telling them, you know, I was just in too much pain that
*  they had to stop.
*  At that point, I remember them giving me more of the pain medication and me saying, it's
*  not making, you know, it's not making a difference.
*  You know, a nurse coming over and putting a wet towel on my head and another nurse holding
*  my hand and them comforting me and saying, you know, you're going to be okay.
*  The nurse who, she was at the top of my body, kind of at my shoulders, wiping the tears
*  away and helping me kind of hold my breath to keep myself still so that the doctors didn't
*  slip with the needle and just telling me that I was going to be okay, that I was going to
*  get through it.
*  And up until that moment, I'm so excited, like, oh, I have 24 follicles, like this is
*  great, like I'm going to have a great egg retrieval.
*  And then you're like, oh my God, I wish there was only one.
*  Like, everything was counting on that retrieval.
*  And that's how it feels, like the whole, the way of, you know, your world.
*  My partner and I, she's counting on me to be able to get through this and to have this
*  successful retrieval.
*  And all I'm feeling is, oh my God, I needed to stop.
*  Is this worth it?
*  And, you know, your feet are in the stirrups and, you know, you're supposed to be laying
*  on the table, but I remember tightening up and just trying to relax my body so that they
*  could do what they needed to do because I was so tense that, like, my bottom was almost
*  off of the table.
*  I remember, like, thrusting my hips up, actually thrusting my hips up saying, I feel everything,
*  like, and like nobody believed me.
*  And it's just like, I don't know.
*  But what are you going to do?
*  I, you know, I wanted the procedure done.
*  I just let it happen.
*  And I was like, I'm awake.
*  So.
*  You know, I was stone cold sober and awake.
*  And I remember I, the egg retrieval, you know, they kind of do them one by one or like a
*  couple at a time, you know, my impression.
*  And so you have moments in between pain to say, like, what the fuck is going on?
*  I do remember, I think I swore I was using curse words because it was just so painful.
*  You know, I don't know if I can do this any longer.
*  You know, you just have to get through it.
*  It's going to be over before you know it.
*  Okay, this is going to be over eventually.
*  You can do this.
*  You can do this.
*  I just want this moment to be over.
*  Get through it.
*  Get through it.
*  I remember yelling or kind of making like, ah, and really like looking in confusion at
*  my nurse, the attending nurse and her saying, you know, I'm giving you the most I can legally
*  give you.
*  She said that that's the maximum that she's allowed to give me.
*  So she couldn't give me anything else.
*  I'm almost certain that at one point they said that they had given me all of the pain
*  medication that they could give me.
*  At one point they did say that I had maxed out.
*  I couldn't have any more fentanyl or Versa.
*  And I was like, how is this possible?
*  How is that even like, how am I feeling?
*  How do people go through this?
*  I can feel that.
*  Like I could feel the, I don't even know how to describe that.
*  Like you can just feel them inside of there.
*  You know, as a woman, we've all been through things, you know, with those kind of doctors
*  and stuff.
*  But like, this is just a pain.
*  It's like hard to even explain what it felt like.
*  This is hard to do, but could you describe the pain that you felt?
*  Oh gosh.
*  It felt like someone was like ripping something from the inside of your body.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is what they were doing.
*  That's what it felt like.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm sorry.
*  But I remember almost immediately thinking or almost daydreaming in that moment that
*  like the attending nurse had one tube going from my IV into my arm and another tube going
*  from my IV into her pocket.
*  Like it occurred to me almost immediately that the nurse was stealing the fentanyl.
*  And I remember telling my friends, you know, after the procedure, my friends who were aware
*  of what I was going through, but who are also colleagues at Yale in addiction research,
*  I remember telling them like the nurse is stealing the fentanyl.
*  Because it seems so obvious to me.
*  I mean, fentanyl is the most diverted drug in medical settings.
*  It's like a now major driver of the opioid crisis.
*  And it was just really easy to imagine that someone with access to, you know, poorly controlled
*  fentanyl would be abusing it.
*  It's so fascinating that that's the image that raised itself up for you because it is
*  so evocative.
*  Because it is so evocative.
*  And also because it was true.
*  A nurse at the clinic was stealing fentanyl.
*  Not Katie's nurse.
*  Not the tube in the pocket.
*  But a nurse at the clinic was stealing fentanyl and replacing it with saline.
*  She did so undetected for months.
*  Which meant patients weren't getting fentanyl in their IVs.
*  They were getting salt water instead.
*  Drug addicted former nurse is sentenced for a crime that caused unbearable pain to dozens
*  of women.
*  The nurse stole drugs and then replaced them with saline solution.
*  Connecticut nurse admits that she swapped out anesthesia drugs for salt water, causing
*  excruciating pain to women during infertility treatments.
*  It happened at a top rated center affiliated with Yale.
*  A horrible story about the extremes a fertility nurse struggling with drug addiction took
*  to get her fix.
*  A federal investigation determined that as many as 200 patients may have been victims
*  of this substitution over five months in 2020.
*  Lawyers for some of the patients believe the real number is higher and this went on for
*  longer.
*  I've talked to a dozen patients who believe they were victims of this.
*  Eleven of them are plaintiffs in a lawsuit against Yale and their lawyers were present
*  when we spoke.
*  When I started doing these interviews, I was struck by the echoes in these women's stories.
*  To me it sounded like a chorus of women saying, something is wrong here, again and again.
*  The patients wondered how the clinic could have failed to detect this.
*  And the conversations I was having made me wonder that too.
*  And then I began talking to other people, staffers who'd been there, and I learned
*  about what went on behind the scenes.
*  The staffers I spoke to were horrified by what the patients had experienced.
*  They were grappling with their own questions about how this had happened, about what had
*  gone amiss.
*  The patients didn't know why they were in pain.
*  Their doctors didn't know either.
*  And in the absence of information about the true cause of the pain, people came up with
*  stories to explain it.
*  The patients constructed stories about why they felt pain.
*  Staffers at the clinic came up with theories too.
*  Eventually the nurse would tell her own story about the pain, which would launch a whole
*  new set of stories.
*  The ones her friends and family would come up with.
*  The one that would get argued in court.
*  The one Yale would tell.
*  And all of these stories revealed something about women's pain.
*  How it's tolerated, interpreted, accounted for, or minimized.
*  In fertility treatment, you evaluate the outcomes by whether you wind up with a baby.
*  That's the metric by which success is measured.
*  It all went well if you leave with a live birth.
*  The outcomes here are a lot more complicated.
*  For everyone.
*  From Serial Productions and The New York Times, I'm Susan Burton.
*  And this is The Retrievals.
*  This is Episode 1.
*  The patients.
*  When the retrieval is over, the women are wheeled out to the recovery room.
*  And one of the first things that happens is that they try to come up with an explanation
*  for their pain.
*  They put you into the recovery room and that's where you meet with whoever you were with.
*  And I just remember that's when I had my phone back and I was texting my sister-in-law because
*  she was my confidant for all of this having been through that.
*  And she was just replying like, oh my god, how could you, what do you mean you felt everything?
*  And I was just explaining to her, I'm like, I don't know what's wrong.
*  And one of the texts I said, I said, I think I'm immune to fentanyl because I don't think
*  it works on me.
*  I'm not sensitive to fentanyl is a common theory.
*  And I remember when the procedure was done.
*  My family sort of, we have a family text that's ongoing and I just remember texting them that
*  it's hard to believe that we have a fentanyl epidemic where people are addicted because
*  it did nothing for me.
*  Not all of the women were alert during their procedures.
*  Some were more deeply sedated.
*  They were so out of it during the retrieval that they don't really remember it or only
*  kind of.
*  The pain hits when they come to.
*  It was bad instantly and it shouldn't really be bad instantly.
*  Like you shouldn't wake up and be in like horrific, like nightmarish pain.
*  But I woke up and I was, I mean like, it felt like someone had been inside me and like gutted
*  me.
*  Yeah, it was like a gutted feeling.
*  It was like someone had been inside me, scraped me hollow, it was burning.
*  In a way it is more confusing for the wake up later patients.
*  They're not matching each stab of pain to the needle on the screen.
*  It hurts a lot, but it's less explicable.
*  And because of that, scarier.
*  You know your mind just goes to the worst possible places.
*  I, you know, I'm thinking, am I bleeding?
*  You know, am I bleeding internally?
*  Is it like a pain is, normally a pain is a sign, is protective, right?
*  It tells you something's wrong.
*  There's a lot of uncertainty in the recovery room.
*  An elevated blood pressure, a nurse running around to get ginger ale, a doctor coming
*  by to say, there are fewer eggs than we expected.
*  Are you sure you only want us to fertilize half of them?
*  It's all just very overwhelming.
*  And on top of it, some of the women feel like they're being rushed out of the clinic.
*  Julia is one of them.
*  I remember vomiting.
*  They were giving me some, some fluids.
*  I was very uncomfortable.
*  There was no way I could walk.
*  They put me in a wheelchair and wheeled me out.
*  And I just, I just, I just had this feeling like this is not, this is not right.
*  Julia is 31 years old and already a college professor.
*  This morning when her husband drove to the clinic, she'd been frantic.
*  There was work on a bridge near their house and they got stuck.
*  There's only a short window to retrieve the eggs before you ovulate them.
*  And Julia was worried she would miss it.
*  When she arrived at the clinic, she felt a huge relief, like we made it, both we made
*  it on time and we made it to this day.
*  Now she's feeling something she never expected.
*  At home, she goes upstairs and gets into bed.
*  I fell asleep for a little while and then I woke up and I was nervous.
*  We had a babysitter here watching my daughter.
*  And I just, you know, you wake up, you're like, oh my God, who's with my kid?
*  I need to, and I walked a few steps to try and go down the stairs.
*  And I realized I really had gone too far from the bed.
*  By this point, the pain was excruciating, I would say.
*  And I turned to go back to lay down in my bed again.
*  I mean, I don't remember this, but I blacked out or passed out.
*  And I woke up on the floor and I kind of busted my lip open.
*  Julia calls the clinic and they tell her that she should go to the ER.
*  She's in so much pain that she can't bend enough to get into a car.
*  An ambulance is called.
*  And when Julia gets to the hospital, they check her out.
*  The retrieval is a safe procedure, but things can go wrong.
*  Your ovary can strangulate.
*  A major artery can get punctured.
*  But none of the obvious things are wrong, and nobody can explain what is.
*  Back home over the weekend, Julia calls the on-call doctor at the clinic multiple times.
*  By Sunday, I sort of got the sense I was annoying him.
*  Julia keeps waiting for a call from her official doctor.
*  By Tuesday, she still hasn't heard from him.
*  It was impossible for me to understand how he hadn't called me by this point.
*  But I called his office on Tuesday, basically saying, I need to talk to you.
*  I wrote down what he said, and I've kept this note since that time.
*  He said he was not alarmed, but perplexed and surprised at my experience.
*  Those words, I guess, ring pretty hollow now, right?
*  Knowing that there was a pattern of many women who had extreme,
*  inexplicable pain after the egg retrieval.
*  What did you make of that language in the moment, perplexed and surprised?
*  It was, I mean, I guess, I felt crazy.
*  I mean, by this point, I'm asking myself, am I being difficult?
*  Am I, I mean, you just question your sense of self,
*  like your ability to assess your situation rationally,
*  which is very disconcerting when that happens,
*  because at least at the end of the day, you have that, right?
*  You start thinking about your whole life, right?
*  Like, I'm a pretty high energy person.
*  Like, I take care of a toddler.
*  I have a PhD. I have a job.
*  Like, I run marathons in my free time.
*  Like, I'm not, you know, like you have all these parts of your life
*  that make you feel like that give you this sense of like who you are.
*  And then I just felt like they were treating me like I was like nuts,
*  you know, for still, you know, being in pain and just having
*  what I would call a difficult time.
*  You know, I just left the office.
*  I mean, crying, you know,
*  I just felt like, like nobody, nobody cares.
*  That's the way I would describe how I felt in the days after.
*  Like, nobody gives a crap that that this was so hard for me.
*  In the days after the retrieval,
*  other patients live out versions of the same story.
*  They also call the clinic.
*  They ask, is this normal?
*  They say the Tylenol isn't helping.
*  At home, they're laid up on the couch.
*  They can't pick up their toddler.
*  They wonder if they really should have scheduled themselves for a shift the next day.
*  Not all staffers at the clinic are dismissive,
*  but even when they respond with concern, there aren't any real answers.
*  Some of these conversations take place days after the procedure,
*  like at follow ups to talk about next steps.
*  You didn't really talk to the office until day five or day six,
*  which is when I found out that none of the eggs had survived.
*  None were healthy enough to go to testing.
*  And we had to talk about moving forward.
*  And that's when I really expressed my sort of shock
*  that the procedure was as painful as it was,
*  and talked about if there were other pain management protocols
*  that could be considered at that point.
*  I was told that that was the best pain medication that was available.
*  And my doctor prescribed me an anxiety medication
*  to take before the next procedure.
*  And I remember saying to my husband,
*  you know, I think it's strange because I'm not anxious about a medical procedure.
*  You know, it was the pain.
*  It was severe pain, not anxiety about going into it.
*  The next time that I saw my doctor, he asked me how the procedure went.
*  And I said it was really, really painful.
*  And he was kind of like a little bit concerned,
*  but then he just didn't say anything after that.
*  So I was like, OK, I guess.
*  And this was my first time doing it, so I didn't know any better.
*  So I was like, OK, I guess it's supposed to be painful.
*  Other women are talking about what happened with family and friends.
*  So at that point, I had talked to a couple of family members who had done retrievals,
*  and I felt even worse.
*  There's nothing like feeling shame from like another female and unintentional, too.
*  You know, like that just seems weird because, you know,
*  I was wheeled back there and joked with the staff and then fell asleep
*  and woke up and was fine.
*  And that seemed to be the general consensus between procedures at different clinics that,
*  oh, yeah, I was kind of alert, but I didn't feel anything.
*  It was really no big deal.
*  Like the shots ahead of time were way worse than the actual procedure.
*  And I started shutting down after hearing those stories that this was on me.
*  Like I something wasn't right with my tolerance and my ability to handle this.
*  The women are already settling on their stories about what happened to them.
*  I'm immune to fentanyl.
*  It's my fault.
*  It's supposed to be painful.
*  The clinic tells patients that they may experience mild discomfort,
*  but now some of them have recalibrated their expectations,
*  including Lynn, who will have eight retrievals at the clinic.
*  All of them will cause her excruciating pain.
*  You know, again, you hear about IVF and how tough of a process it is mentally and physically.
*  And, you know, I just thought this is what I have to do.
*  This is what I have to do.
*  And sort of just thought this is what women go through.
*  Yael declined to offer information about how reports of pain were addressed at the clinic
*  or to answer any other questions.
*  Episode 1 of The Retrievals continues after the break.
*  Of the 12 patients I spoke to, most are white.
*  The one black woman in the group was often the only black woman in the clinic waiting room.
*  Everyone in the group identified as a woman.
*  While a couple of them were pursuing pregnancy for the first time as they neared 40,
*  most did not fit that stereotype.
*  Most were married to men, one to a woman.
*  That patient would provide the eggs and her wife would carry the pregnancy.
*  Her wife presents as more stereotypically masculine, doesn't wear women's clothing,
*  and at first family members were like,
*  are you sure you want to do it this way?
*  Yes, they were sure.
*  One was doing this on her own at 41 after the end of a long relationship.
*  Another left her boyfriend partway through the process
*  and then fell in love with the new guy at the office.
*  One was born in Iran and came to the U.S. as a refugee.
*  Another grew up in Jamaica.
*  One had what she described as a horrible childhood.
*  She essentially had to raise herself.
*  Another longed to have a second baby
*  because she was so close to all of her siblings.
*  One had type 1 diabetes and was used to everyone
*  always attributing all medical issues to, oh, it's your diabetes.
*  All of them worked.
*  A special ed teacher, an accountant at a maritime firm,
*  and a lecturer at Yale in the Department of American Studies.
*  Her name is Lea.
*  Her scholarship encompasses a variety of subjects.
*  Exile and migration.
*  She's the patient who came to the U.S. as a refugee from Iran.
*  And gender.
*  From the beginning of her treatment,
*  Lea located her experience within a context of assumptions
*  about women patients,
*  that they are unreliable narrators of their own symptoms,
*  that they are anxious, exaggerating.
*  But I remember the first time I went in there
*  to get ready for the ultrasound, there was blood on the floor
*  from a previous person's ultrasound.
*  And I have to tell you, it was as ominous as the signs fucking come.
*  And I just remember me and Navid was with me, I think.
*  Was Navid with me?
*  Or I subsequently...
*  Oh, no, he couldn't go inside. He was waiting in the car.
*  My husband was waiting in the car.
*  I was just shaking. I was like, this isn't good.
*  I mean, it was like, you walk in and I was like, there's blood?
*  You guys left blood over?
*  What is going on here?
*  Did you say anything to...
*  Like, did you say that?
*  But here's the thing, and this is where it begins,
*  is you are treated like a hysterical woman
*  from the second you walk in there.
*  So you already know.
*  And like as a, you know, like a person who...
*  Like, I study this stuff, I teach this stuff,
*  and you're there and you're like, oh, this is actually what's happening right now.
*  Here comes like Freud's patient, the hysterical woman,
*  who's childless and angry and hormonal and terrified and bitchy and mean.
*  And that's how we're going to treat her.
*  Hysteria comes from the Greek word for uterus.
*  Ancient explanations for it involve an empty uterus.
*  A woman was hysterical because her uterus was not full.
*  Unanchored, the uterus roved through the body,
*  which was what made women sick and crazy.
*  To fix hysteria, you really needed to fill that uterus up.
*  Like, so with the blood, I remember being like,
*  there's blood on the floor, you know?
*  I was really upset and they're like, okay, okay.
*  I mean, it's, you know, it turned right back on me.
*  And I remember one of the nurses was like, okay, well, you can calm down.
*  You know, I was told to calm down.
*  And I mean, and then when they're doing the ultrasounds, of course,
*  someone's doing a transvaginal ultrasound.
*  So there's literally like this stick that's inside of you
*  and they're moving it around.
*  And if you cringe, okay, it'll just be like another,
*  it's just another second.
*  It's just, okay, just be patient.
*  So you're constantly overemphasizing or overdramatizing what's happening.
*  It's not that big of a deal.
*  Leah felt like her doctor wasn't listening to her.
*  She also didn't trust her assigned nurse.
*  Then came Leah's first retrieval.
*  She felt her pain wasn't taken seriously by anyone.
*  She says they all blew her off.
*  Leah wasn't happy with her treatment, but she decided to continue.
*  Here I was.
*  I saw it.
*  I felt it.
*  I was alarmed by it.
*  But I kept going because I wanted to have a baby.
*  Leah asked for a new doctor.
*  He oversaw her next cycle, and soon she went in for another retrieval.
*  Right after you're in that room, the anesthesiologist came up to me
*  and she said, you know what?
*  You were waking up.
*  You were waking up.
*  We had to give you some more meds.
*  You know, you were waking up.
*  So again, you, your body, you were nervous, you were agitated.
*  You burdened us.
*  Your kind of uncontrollable body put us in a position
*  where we actually had to give you more drugs.
*  You were waking up, so we had to give you more fentanyl.
*  And I was like, oh.
*  But again, to them, to them, I'm this woman who's already like on edge.
*  I already left the doctor because I didn't like the doctor.
*  So the other physicians and the other nurses all know this about me.
*  I'm a kind of already unruly, perhaps entitled, overly kind of needy woman
*  who's just really angry that she doesn't have a baby.
*  There's a balance you have to strike as a woman patient.
*  You have to complain just the right amount to be taken seriously,
*  but not so much that you seem shrill.
*  Still, your pain is more likely to be underestimated than men's.
*  Black women are more likely to have their pain ignored no matter what they do.
*  All of this we know from the literature and also from life.
*  In my life, I've been the kind of patient where if I've ever spoken up,
*  I felt like I need to be obsequious later to protect myself.
*  That is what I felt I needed to perform.
*  Leia knew she'd need to perform a whole range of things in order to get help.
*  Stern, docile, smart, stupid, agreeable.
*  And now, on a gurney in the recovery room, Leia became an observer.
*  She would remember what was happening.
*  She would write about this one day.
*  She tuned into the language, into the emphasis that to her seemed so
*  interesting and fucked up, into the syntax that seemed to place the blame on her body.
*  But at the same time, Leia had also internalized the narrative
*  that her body was to blame.
*  Her body was inadequate, deficient.
*  That was why she was here.
*  Her body had had miscarriages.
*  Her body didn't make enough eggs.
*  Her body couldn't cooperate long enough to get through a critical procedure.
*  Oh, God, my body.
*  Here it goes again.
*  Not only can I not have a baby, I also can't even just lay still
*  with the right amount of fentanyl.
*  In this moment and throughout her treatment, Leia was simultaneously the writer saying,
*  I can name what's happening here.
*  And the patient saying, how could I have let this happen?
*  Other women occupied their own versions of this position.
*  Their professional identities offered them one kind of story about these events.
*  Their identities as patients directed them to another.
*  Several of them had an area of expertise that was directly applicable here
*  in a way that is kind of uncanny.
*  For example, there are multiple patients who work in healthcare,
*  including one who's designed systems for the safe storage of medications.
*  There's a nurse anesthetist.
*  She thought the anesthesia was the one part of fertility treatment
*  she wouldn't have to worry about.
*  And of course, there's the addiction researcher, Katie, who had the prophetic fantasy.
*  What's unique about you is that not only did you know something was wrong,
*  you knew exactly what was wrong.
*  I did.
*  Yet still, you constructed like this other narrative to explain it.
*  Yes.
*  Like other patients, Katie had expertise that gave her knowledge.
*  But she and others pushed that knowledge aside.
*  They decided not to know what they knew in order to keep going.
*  I wanted Katie to lay out the path to that cognitive dissonance.
*  I wanted her to explain exactly how she got from one story to the other.
*  I mean, as I've told you, I came out of that procedure and
*  I remember immediately texting my friends who are also colleagues in
*  addiction research at Yale, like the nurse is stealing the fentanyl.
*  It just seemed so obvious.
*  But then you sort of come out of the, I remember just coming out of the shock and
*  recovering from the procedure and things just go on.
*  No one is addressing the fact that I was sober during the procedure.
*  And I remember violently shaking in recovery from the shock.
*  I don't know that that's related to having the procedure with or
*  without fentanyl, but that's how my body responded.
*  And my nurse was there and I remember her saying something like,
*  I think it was so painful because we got so many eggs.
*  And so it's just sort of this positive kind of false narrative
*  about what had happened.
*  And so then I think I coped by coming up with an alternate explanation,
*  which was that I do remember waking up during my, having my wisdom teeth being
*  pulled when I was a kid to the nurse saying, shit, shit.
*  And then giving me more drugs, putting me back under.
*  So the other explanation for me was that maybe I'm not sensitive to certain opiates.
*  And I remember also that kind of became my narrative with my friends and
*  colleagues kind of remember me sort of switching to that narrative and saying,
*  well, maybe you're not sensitive to fentanyl.
*  So I started to kind of just tell myself a story about my pain,
*  just try to understand.
*  It's a way of just understanding my experience and thinking,
*  yeah, maybe this is what happened.
*  The story becomes a way not only to explain pain, but to cope with it.
*  A way to not only make sense of the pain, but to manage it, to tamp it down,
*  get through it.
*  And this way, the story becomes the medicine that the patients weren't given.
*  The women gear up for second, third retrievals.
*  They change their diets.
*  They cut chemicals out of their home.
*  They read the books the nurses recommend.
*  Or they get ready for embryo transfers.
*  They make reservations at a hotel in town so
*  that they won't have to drive home over a bumpy road.
*  Despite these efforts, some of the women miscarry.
*  One woman wakes up about ten days after her embryo transfer with some spotting.
*  Don't think anything of that yet, a nurse reassures her.
*  But the pregnancy test comes back negative.
*  When do you think you might want to get started again?
*  Her doctor asks her at a virtual follow-up appointment.
*  I'm not ready, the patient says.
*  She closes the telehealth, and
*  that's the last time she talks to the doctor.
*  She never goes back to that clinic.
*  She stopped fertility treatment and doesn't know when or
*  if she will ever resume it.
*  She never wants to go through an egg retrieval again.
*  Fertility treatment doesn't always result in a good result.
*  It's not just giving yourself shots that's hard.
*  It's the cycle of hope and loss.
*  It just clobbers you.
*  And the longer you stay in it, the more the drugs mess with your head.
*  It's called the Clomid crazies for a reason, one of the women tells me.
*  And the money, always the money.
*  If your insurance covers this, it probably only covers a few cycles.
*  There's so much pressure on each one.
*  Once you have to pay out of pocket, you're talking maybe 15K for one cycle.
*  And that's the low end.
*  Some of the women are keeping their treatment secret.
*  One of them can't even tell her own mother.
*  It's hard.
*  It's hard to begin with, even without this extra layer that's been added on to
*  this now, the pain and the fear of more of it.
*  The first time I went in clueless, thinking you're not gonna feel a thing.
*  So I think the second time I had a lot more anxiety.
*  Laura doesn't get as many eggs as she hoped for the first time around.
*  It's urgent that she start cancer treatment, and
*  the doctors accelerate her cycle.
*  Her second retrieval is scheduled for
*  barely more than two weeks after her first.
*  That morning, Laura's mother drives her to the clinic and
*  sits in the waiting room while Laura goes back for the procedure.
*  And I was shocked.
*  I was shocked again that it was the same situation.
*  I'm thrusting my hips and telling these people, why do we speak to them?
*  And I was just like, I feel everything you're doing.
*  And that was when I did, I remember actually saying to them,
*  I could drive myself home right now, I'm that alert.
*  In the recovery room, Laura gets her phone back, and
*  just like last time, texts her sister-in-law.
*  Then she sees her mom.
*  She tells them both how much pain she's in.
*  So my sister-in-law right away was like, my God,
*  I cannot believe you felt that again.
*  But my mom, she just felt, it's hard because she had seen me go through so
*  much as it was with the cancer, any mother who has to live watching their daughter go
*  through that, and then for me to tell her, this was supposed to be a special moment
*  because we're preserving my fertility, and I'm sorry.
*  It's okay.
*  And for her to see that, it hurts her to see me in pain.
*  And I was just like, well, thank God,
*  I think this was the last time I had to do that.
*  What did the two of you do the rest of that day?
*  Did she drive you home?
*  Yeah, she drove me home and she stayed with me because she had already been
*  staying with me a lot during the day after my surgeries because I couldn't even.
*  At that point, I still wasn't allowed to lift more than five pounds because I was
*  still recovering from the other surgeries.
*  So, yeah, she was with me and maybe lunch and comforted me.
*  And we were like, okay, so now we just go back to waiting and hoping we get a good
*  number and I just moved on from it because I faced many more surgeries that year as
*  well.
*  So, I kind of had to just switch back into survival mode, like, okay, now we just
*  battle the next thing.
*  So.
*  In the other surgeries you had, like cancer related surgeries, like, what were your
*  experiences of pain like?
*  It's actually interesting that you bring that up, because when I did have my double
*  mastectomy, I was hospitalized.
*  I think I was in for a day or two days.
*  And strangely enough, the nurse, the night nurse, forgot to give me morphine.
*  So I actually was awakened in pain the entire night.
*  And I have a gluten allergy, so they couldn't feed me anything because the kitchen was closed.
*  So I spent the entire night vomiting because they were trying to give me like Percocets
*  or something.
*  And so I know what pain feels like.
*  I've, whatever.
*  And the next morning the doctor goes, I don't understand why she didn't give it to you.
*  It was in the order.
*  And I had a really young nurse.
*  Whatever.
*  This is completely unrelated to that.
*  But I know what pain feels like.
*  I've been through it.
*  And then when I was hospitalized at Christmas, that's funny that you bring that up because
*  my sister-in-law actually had pointed out, she goes, do you remember when you kept telling
*  me you were immune to fentanyl?
*  She goes, when I did a search on my phone, I guess you can, she's really savvy.
*  You can type in like fentanyl in text messages and it'll bring up every conversation.
*  She goes, I actually found one from when you were hospitalized at Christmas saying that
*  you were on fentanyl.
*  I guess she had sent me a picture of her Christmas tree and I had made a comment like, oh my
*  God, did your house burn down?
*  And she was just like, and she was like, what are you talking about?
*  And I said, I don't know.
*  The nurse just gave me fentanyl.
*  And so she goes, look, Laura, so it does work on you.
*  And this was a month prior and that didn't even dawn on me.
*  Like, oh my God.
*  But when it came time for the other thing, I was just like, oh, it must not work on me.
*  Because I just felt like nobody had heard what I was saying.
*  So it just didn't exist.
*  It was in my head.
*  So yeah, so I don't know.
*  Was I foolish?
*  Because I didn't dispute it more?
*  Maybe not.
*  I don't know.
*  But I believe them.
*  You trust them.
*  Months pass.
*  Some of the women get pregnant.
*  Others are still trying.
*  Some of them are still showing up at that clinic for blood draws when they open their
*  mailboxes in December 2020.
*  Christmas was on a Friday of 2020.
*  And the mail arrived on Thursday.
*  It was Christmas Eve.
*  And I was busy.
*  And I just thought, I'm just not, I'm not going to go get the mail today.
*  And I waited until Monday, the 28th.
*  And you know, it was a nice day.
*  I went outside, I got the mail and you know, I got this letter.
*  So I got this letter in the mail.
*  It's nothing fancy.
*  It's a Yale envelope.
*  I'm assuming it's a bill.
*  Bills never stop coming with IVF.
*  You get so much when you work at Yale.
*  Also, you just get like Yale emblazoned mail.
*  And so you're like, oh, okay, whatever.
*  It was like this thin thing.
*  And I was like, oh, they, you know, change locations or something.
*  It's like, this is not important.
*  And instead of just setting it aside, I happened to open it.
*  And I was furious.
*  And it says, Dear Kathleen Garrison, I'm writing you, I'm writing to you in my role as director
*  of Yale Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility to let you know that we have learned of an
*  event that may have involved your care.
*  You know, that they've become aware that the nurse was switching out the fentanyl with
*  the saline.
*  A few weeks ago, we learned that on multiple occasions, a Yale Fertility Center nurse replaced
*  fentanyl, a routinely used narcotic medication, with a normal salt solution, saline, in some
*  medication vials.
*  As a result, some patients may have received saline instead of the intended narcotic medication
*  during their procedures.
*  While there's no reason to believe that this event has had any negative effect on your
*  health or the outcome of the care that you received, we believe that you should be informed.
*  They make this stupid comment in the letter that there was no harm done from this happening.
*  I don't know if Hall was home or I called her and I was like, bullshit, no harm done?
*  Don't send me a letter and tell me that we're confident no one's outcomes were affected
*  by this.
*  I know my outcomes were affected by this.
*  I know what I experienced and went through.
*  But Yale wasn't going to help me.
*  They didn't think there was harm.
*  They didn't think it was a problem.
*  You know, that it was the most, honestly, I think it was one of the most disrespectful
*  ways they probably could have notified any of us that it had happened.
*  That you know, oh, we had this little breach and you're fine.
*  No biggie.
*  Go about your day.
*  Again, no one reached out to talk with us or to see what we experienced as patients.
*  My only communication about it was through the letter.
*  And that's still to this day.
*  And yet in addition to fury, there's also vindication.
*  When they learn the news, however they learn it, the women text their twin sister or run
*  inside to their husband or weep in their kitchen.
*  It was mind blowing.
*  I immediately called my mother.
*  I immediately called my sister-in-law and I'm like, oh, like, I don't know.
*  And everything had just hit like, it all makes sense now.
*  And it was like, okay, it all makes sense.
*  It was almost a relief, a relief to know like, you know, I'm not crazy.
*  There's nothing wrong with my body.
*  I don't have something like blocking opioids or, you know, where, you know, my body is
*  wrong and doesn't react to medicine.
*  But it also shows how much they ignored my pleas for help and like saying like, nobody
*  believed me.
*  And so in a sense, it was like relief, you know, just knowing that what I felt was real.
*  But there's more.
*  The letter continues.
*  The law enforcement investigation and our own review have found no reason to believe
*  that you were exposed to an infection due to this event.
*  Even so, we can appreciate that you may want further reassurance.
*  And if you wish, we will arrange for you to be tested for a group of blood borne infections
*  at no charge.
*  And I was like, what the fuck?
*  You know, those words, not alarm, but perplexed and surprised came back to me, right?
*  And you just feel like so completely let down by this institution that's supposed to make
*  you feel safe and I mean, keep you safe, right?
*  An institution that's supposed to keep you safe, right?
*  That was gone.
*  But maybe the most remarkable thing about the letter is the way it addresses pain.
*  It seems to be saying you did not feel what you felt.
*  I also want to assure you that the Fertility Center routinely uses a combination of pain
*  medications during procedures.
*  We closely monitor patients for signs of discomfort during every procedure and adjust medications
*  or add medications as needed.
*  In this way, we can be confident that our patients stay comfortable even if one medication
*  is not working.
*  Well, I don't believe that accurately describes my experience.
*  And then it goes on to say if you have any questions or want a blood test, you know,
*  here's who you can call.
*  The women put the letter on the counter in shock.
*  For months, they've been constructing their own stories about what happened to them.
*  Now they have Yale's story, which is that this is barely a story at all.
*  The questions the patients have been asking all along have a new focus.
*  You know, as soon as I received that letter, it's like, how does this happen?
*  You know, and how does it happen at Yale?
*  You know, a hospital system with such a great reputation.
*  And how did it happen for so long?
*  So many things had to go wrong, you know, for this to happen as long as it did.
*  How does an entire facility let this happen?
*  Who trained them?
*  Who thought that this was OK?
*  I get sent home with, you know, I get packages in the mail with sharp needle containers and
*  strict instructions and alcohol swabs and this crazy protocol that I'm expected to do
*  at home.
*  They make you double check things, you know, are there puncture marks?
*  And I'm like, did I really spend more time following directions at home for hormone shots?
*  Like, where were they?
*  I think my immediate reaction was, you know, how could this happen at Yale?
*  Like, why wasn't there a better system in place to prevent it or detect it when it was
*  happening and respond?
*  You know, why wasn't our pain listened to?
*  The women wonder about the system that failed them.
*  But there's something very intimate and human that they're wondering about too.
*  We were notified that it was a nurse.
*  We didn't have the name of the nurse in that original letter.
*  And so it's sort of, you know, racing through your mind like, well, which nurse?
*  Because you build such a strong relationship with these people and you see them so often
*  and you trust them and, you know, build a relationship.
*  And so you're thinking like, well, which nurse could this have been?
*  And then you're you're showing up, you know, and OK, who's not here anymore?
*  Who's gone?
*  And just trying to figure out who it was.
*  The patients know what happened.
*  They're about to find out who did it.
*  That's next.
