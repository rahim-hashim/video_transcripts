*  Hi, my name is A. All Press and I'm a contributor to the New York Times magazine.
*  A few years ago, I got this email from a high-ranking official at a hospital that sent
*  me down a rabbit hole.
*  The Times had just published an excerpt from a book of mine called Dirty Work, which
*  examines low-wage, low-status workers in places like the prison system and the meat-packing
*  industry.
*  The book looked not only at the economic challenges these workers face, but also at the moral
*  dilemmas they experience doing their jobs, how it can go against their core values.
*  This hospital official had read my excerpt and they wrote to me, saying there's another
*  group I should look into that might also fit into the topic of Dirty Work.
*  A group of workers who are going through dilemmas as wrenching as those of Border Patrol
*  agents and slaughterhouse workers, and they were talking about doctors.
*  At first, I was skeptical.
*  Like really, physicians who are earning $200,000 salaries and have degrees from Harvard
*  and NYU are experiencing this same level of moral crisis, but I gave this person a call
*  and that's where this Sunday read begins.
*  The story that I think is familiar to people is that doctors are burning out.
*  They're working too hard, they're seeing too much suffering, and it's wearing on them
*  over long hours and sleepless nights, especially since the pandemic.
*  But that's only part of the story.
*  In this piece for the magazine, I wrote about the ethical quandaries that physicians are
*  finding themselves in as they try to provide care in an American medical system that's
*  increasingly driven by profit.
*  You see it playing out across the country.
*  Pediatric treatment is being willed down because it's not a money maker.
*  Primary care practices are getting bought up by CVS and Amazon, and that's left doctors
*  feeling controlled and pressured to do things that go against their own medical ethics.
*  I spoke with dozens of physicians who said they're finding themselves in extremely uncomfortable
*  situations, like having a seven minute window to see patients or being forced to switch
*  a patient to a new medication because that's what their insurance will cover, even when
*  it's dangerous to do that.
*  Or having a patient come to them in tears over an expensive hospital bill that they then
*  have to explain.
*  One provider became emotional, telling me how at her practice, she's so squeezed for
*  time that she can't even sit by a patient's side while they're dying.
*  And so more and more, doctors are feeling that they're the face of a system they can't
*  morally defend.
*  They've come to feel like scapegoats for the systems inequities.
*  And in some instances, one source told me, they feel that they are acting as the instruments
*  of a system they don't even believe in anymore.
*  Throughout my reporting, all of the doctors I spoke with took pains to say, look, this
*  concerns me primarily because of what it means for my patients, not what it means for
*  me.
*  Doctors also feel like victims of the system and the numbers very much confirm this, whether
*  it's the alarming suicide rate among physicians or the number of doctors who are considering
*  quitting and pursuing something else.
*  Since my article came out, I've been flooded with correspondence from doctors.
*  Just letter after letter from people telling me they've considered quitting or they are
*  quitting, or they left the country to go practice medicine in New Zealand or Canada.
*  I haven't gotten a single letter from a doctor saying the system is just fine.
*  In fact, most have told me, you've scratched the surface of how bad things really are and
*  how bad they're going to get.
*  So here's my article, The Moral Crisis of America's Doctors, read by Eduardo Bavarini.
*  Some years ago, a psychiatrist named Wendy Dean read an article about a physician who died
*  by suicide.
*  Such deaths were distressingly common, she discovered.
*  The suicide rate among doctors appeared to be even higher than the rate among active military
*  members, a notion that startled Dean who was then working as an administrator at a US Army
*  Medical Research Center in Maryland.
*  When started asking the physicians, she knew how they felt about their jobs, and many of
*  them confided that they were struggling.
*  Some complained that they didn't have enough time to talk to their patients because they
*  were too busy filling out electronic medical records.
*  Others bemoaned having to fight with insurers about whether a person with a serious illness
*  would be pre-approved for medication.
*  The doctors Dean surveyed were deeply committed to the medical profession, but many of them were
*  frustrated and unhappy, she sensed, not because they were burned out from working too hard
*  but because the healthcare system made it so difficult to care for their patients.
*  In July 2018, Dean published an essay with Simon G. Talbot, a plastic and reconstructive
*  surgeon that argued that many physicians were suffering from a condition known as moral
*  injury.
*  Military psychiatrists used the term to describe an emotional wound sustained when, in the
*  course of fulfilling their duties, soldiers witnessed or committed acts, raiding a home,
*  killing a non-combatant, that transgressed their core values.
*  Doctors on the front lines of America's profit-driven healthcare system were also susceptible to
*  such wounds, Dean and Talbot submitted, as the demands of administrators, hospital executives
*  and insurers, forced them to stray from the ethical principles that were supposed to
*  govern their profession.
*  The pull of these forces left many doctors anguished and distraught, caught between the
*  Hippocratic oath and the realities of making a profit from people at their sickest and
*  most vulnerable.
*  The article was published on STAT, a medical news website with a modest readership.
*  To Dean's surprise, it quickly went viral.
*  Doctors and nurses started reaching out to Dean to tell her how much the article spoke
*  to them.
*  It went everywhere.
*  Dean told me when I visited her last March in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where she now lives.
*  By the time we met, the distress among medical professionals had reached alarming levels.
*  One survey found that nearly one in five healthcare workers had quit their job since the start
*  of the pandemic, and that an additional 31% had considered leaving.
*  Professional organizations like National Nurses United, the largest group of registered
*  nurses in the country, had begun referring to moral injury and moral distress in pamphlets
*  and news releases.
*  Mona Masoud, a psychiatrist who established a support line for doctors shortly after the
*  pandemic began, recalls being struck by how clinicians reacted when she mentioned the
*  term.
*  I remember all these physicians were like, wow, that is what I was looking for, she says.
*  This is it.
*  Dean's essay caught my eye too, because I spent much of the previous few years reporting
*  on moral injury.
*  Saving workers in menial occupations whose jobs were ethically compromising.
*  I spoke to prison guards who patrolled the wards of violent penitentiaries, undocumented
*  immigrants who toiled on the kill floors of industrial slaughterhouses, and roused abouts
*  who worked on offshore rigs in the fossil fuel industry.
*  Many of these workers were hesitant to talk or be identified, knowing how easily they
*  could be replaced by someone else.
*  And with them, physicians were privileged, earning six figure salaries, and doing prestigious
*  jobs that spared them from the drudgery endured by so many other members of the labor force,
*  including nurses and custodial workers in the healthcare industry.
*  But in recent years, despite the esteem associated with their profession, many physicians have
*  found themselves subjected to practices more commonly associated with manual labor
*  and auto plants and Amazon warehouses, like having their productivity tracked on an
*  hourly basis and being pressured by management to work faster.
*  Because doctors are highly skilled professionals who are not so easy to replace, I assume
*  that they would not be as reluctant to discuss the distressing conditions at their jobs
*  as the low wage workers I'd interviewed.
*  But the physicians I contacted were afraid to talk openly.
*  I have since reconsidered this, and do not feel this is something I can do right now,
*  one doctor wrote to me.
*  Other texted, will need to be a non.
*  Some sources I tried to reach had signed non-disclosure agreements that prohibited them from speaking
*  to the media without permission.
*  Others worried they could be disciplined or fired if they angered their employers, a
*  concern that seems particularly well-founded in the growing swath of the healthcare system
*  that has been taken over by private equity firms.
*  In March 2020, an emergency room doctor named Ming Lin was removed from the rotation at
*  his hospital after airing concerns about its COVID-19 safety protocols.
*  Lin worked at St. Joseph Medical Center in Bellingham, Washington, but his actual employer
*  was Team Health, a company owned by the Blackstone Group.
*  ER doctors have found themselves at the forefront of these trends as more and more hospitals
*  have outsourced the staffing in emergency departments in order to cut costs.
*  A 2013 study by Robert McNamara, the chairman of the Emergency Medicine Department at Temple
*  University in Philadelphia, found that 62% of emergency physicians in the United States
*  could be fired without due process.
*  Nearly 20% of the 389 ER doctors surveyed said they had been threatened for raising quality
*  of care concerns and pressured to make decisions based on financial considerations that could
*  be detrimental to the people in their care, like being pushed to discharge Medicare and
*  Medicaid patients or being encouraged to order more testing than necessary.
*  In another study, more than 70% of emergency physicians agreed that the corporatization
*  of their field has had a negative or strongly negative impact on the quality of care and
*  on their own job satisfaction.
*  There are of course plenty of doctors who like what they do and feel no need to speak out.
*  Clinicians in high paying specialties like orthopedics and plastic surgery are doing just
*  fine, thank you, one physician I know joked.
*  But more and more doctors are coming to believe that the pandemic merely worsened the strain
*  on a healthcare system that was already failing because it prioritized profits over patient
*  care.
*  They are noticing how the emphasis on the bottom line routinely puts them in moral
*  binds, and young doctors in particular are contemplating how to resist.
*  Some are mulling whether the sacrifices and compromises are even worth it.
*  I think a lot of doctors are feeling like something is troubling them, something deep
*  in their core that they committed themselves to, Dean says.
*  She notes that the term moral injury was originally coined by the psychiatrist Jonathan Shey
*  to describe the wound that forms when a person's sense of what is right is betrayed by leaders
*  in high-stakes situations.
*  Not only are clinicians feeling betrayed by their leadership, she says, but when they allow
*  these barriers to get in the way, they are part of the betrayal.
*  They are the instruments of betrayal.
*  Not long ago I spoke to an emergency physician whom I'll call A about her experience.
*  She did not want her name used, explaining that she knew several doctors would be fired
*  for voicing concerns about unsatisfactory working conditions or patient safety issues.
*  A soft-spoken woman, with a gentle manner, A, referred to the emergency room as a sacred
*  space, a place she loved working because of the profound impact she could have on patients'
*  lives, even those who weren't going to pull through.
*  During her training, a patient with a terminal condition somberly informed her that his daughter
*  couldn't make it to the hospital to be with him in his final hours.
*  A promised the patient that he wouldn't die alone and then held his hand until he passed
*  away.
*  Interactions like that one would not be possible today, she told me, because of the new emphasis
*  on speed, efficiency and relative value units, RVU, a metric used to measure physician reimbursement
*  that some feel rewards doctors for doing tests and procedures and discourages them from
*  spending too much time unless remunerative functions, like listening and talking to patients.
*  It's all about RVUs and going faster.
*  She said of the ethos that permeated the practice where she'd been working.
*  Your door to doctor time, your room to doctor time, your time from initial evaluation to
*  discharge.
*  Appeasing her peers and superiors without breaching her values became increasingly
*  difficult for A. On one occasion, a frail elderly woman came into the ER because she was unable
*  to walk on her own.
*  A nurse case manager determined that the woman should be discharged because she didn't
*  have a specific diagnosis to explain her condition and Medicare wouldn't cover her
*  stay, even though she lived alone and couldn't get out of a chair to eat or go to the bathroom.
*  A cried with the woman and tried to comfort her.
*  Then she pleaded with a hospitalist on duty to admit her.
*  A's appeal was successful, but afterward she wondered, what are we being asked to do?
*  When we spoke, A had taken a leave from work and was unsure if she would ever go back
*  because of how depleted she felt.
*  It's all about the almighty dollar and all about productivity, she said, which is obviously
*  not why most of us sign up to do the job.
*  That's not always clear to patients, many of whom naturally assume that their doctors
*  are the ones who decide how much time to spend with them and what to charge them for
*  care.
*  Doctors are increasingly the scapegoats of systemic problems within the healthcare system,
*  Masood says, because the patient is not seeing the insurance company that denied them the
*  procedure.
*  They're not seeing the electronic medical records that are taking up all of our time.
*  They're just seeing the doctor who can only spend 10 minutes with them in the room, or
*  the doctor who says, I can't get you this medication because it costs $500 a month.
*  And what ends up happening is we internalize that feeling.
*  I spoke to a rheumatologist named Diana Grenita, who found this cycle deeply distressing,
*  originally from Romania, Grenita came to the United States to do a post-doc at Harvard
*  and was dazzled by the quality of the training she received.
*  Then she began practicing and hearing patients complain about the exorbitant bills they
*  were sent for routine labs and medications.
*  One patient came to her in tears after being billed $7,000 for an IV infusion, for which
*  the patient held her responsible.
*  They have to blame someone, and we are the interface of the system, she said.
*  They think we are the greedy ones.
*  Fed up Grenita eventually left the practice.
*  Some doctors acknowledged that the pressures of the system had occasionally led them to
*  betray the oaths they took to their patients.
*  Among the physicians I spoke to about this, a 45-year-old critical care specialist named
*  Keith Coral stood out.
*  Raised in a working class town in upstate New York, Coral was an idealist who quit a lucrative
*  job in finance in his early 20s because he wanted to do something that would benefit
*  people.
*  In medical school he felt inspired, watching doctors in the ER and ICU stretch themselves
*  to the breaking point to treat whoever happened to pass through the doors on a given night.
*  I want to do that, he decided instantly, and he did, spending nearly two decades working
*  long shifts as an emergency physician in an array of hospitals, and cities from Providence
*  to Las Vegas to Sacramento, where he now lives.
*  Like many ER physicians, Coral viewed his job as a calling.
*  But over time his idealism gave way to disillusionment, as he struggled to provide patients with
*  the type of care he'd been trained to deliver.
*  Every day you deal with somebody who couldn't get some test or some treatment they needed
*  because they didn't have insurance, he said.
*  Every day you're reminded how savage the system is.
*  Coral was particularly haunted by something that happened in his late 30s when he was working
*  in the emergency room of the hospital in Patucket, Rhode Island.
*  It was a frigid winter night.
*  So cold you could see your breath.
*  The hospital was busy.
*  When Coral arrived for his shift, all of the facilities ER beds were filled.
*  Coral was especially concerned about an elderly woman with pneumonia, who feared might be slipping
*  into sepsis, an extreme, potentially fatal immune response to infection.
*  As Coral was monitoring her, a call came in from an ambulance, informing the ER staff that
*  another patient would soon be arriving.
*  A woman with severe mental health problems.
*  The patient was familiar to Coral.
*  She was a frequent presence in the emergency room.
*  He knew that she had bipolar disorder.
*  He also knew that she could be a handful.
*  On a previous visit to the hospital, she detached the bedrails on her stretcher and
*  fell to the floor injuring a nurse.
*  In a hospital that was adequately staffed, managing such a situation while keeping tabs
*  and all the other patients might not have been a problem.
*  But Coral was the sole doctor in the emergency room that night.
*  He understood this to be in part a result of cost-cutting measures.
*  The hospital has since closed.
*  After the ambulance arrived, he and a nurse began talking with the incoming patient to
*  gauge whether she was suicidal.
*  They determined she was not.
*  But she was combative, arguing with the nurse in an increasingly aggressive tone.
*  As the argument grew more heated, Coral began to fear that if he and the nurse focused
*  too much of their attention on her, other patients would suffer needlessly.
*  That the woman at risk of septic shock might die.
*  Coral decided he could not let that happen.
*  Exchanging glances, he and the nurse unplugged the patient from the monitor, wheeled her
*  stretcher down the hall and pushed it out at the hospital.
*  The blast of cold air when the door swung open caused Coral to shut her.
*  A nurse called the police to come pick the patient up.
*  It turned out that she had an outstanding warrant and was arrested.
*  Later, after he returned to the ER, Coral could not stop thinking about what he'd done,
*  imagining how the medical school version of himself would have judged his conduct.
*  He would have been horrified.
*  Concerns about the corporate takeover of America's medical system are hardly new.
*  More than half a century ago, the writers Barbara and John Ahrin Reich assailed the power
*  of pharmaceutical companies and other large corporations and what they termed the medical
*  industrial complex, which, as the phrase suggests, was anything but a charitable enterprise.
*  In the decades that followed, the official bodies of the medical profession seemed untroubled
*  by this.
*  To the contrary, the American Medical Association consistently opposed efforts to broaden
*  access to healthcare after World War II, undertaking aggressive lobbying campaigns against
*  proposals for a single-payer public system, which it saw as a threat to physicians autonomy.
*  But as the sociologist Paul Star noted in the social transformation of American medicine,
*  physicians earned the public's trust and derived much of their authority because they were
*  perceived to be above the market and pure commercialism, and in fields like emergency medicine and
*  ethos of service and self-sacrifice prevailed.
*  At academic training programs Robert McNamara told me, students were taught that the needs
*  of patients should always come first, and that doctors should never allow financial interest
*  to interfere with how they did their jobs.
*  Many of these programs were based in inner-city hospitals, whose emergency rooms were often
*  filled with indigent patients.
*  Carrying for people regardless of their financial means was both a legal obligation, codified
*  in the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, a federal law passed in 1986, and in programs
*  like the one McNamara ran at Temple, a point of pride.
*  But he acknowledged that over time these values increasingly clashed with the reality that
*  residents encountered once they entered the workforce.
*  We're training people to put the patient first, he says, and they're running into a buzz
*  saw.
*  Throughout the medical system, the insistence on revenue and profits has accelerated.
*  This can be seen in the shuttering of pediatric units at many hospitals and regional medical
*  centers, in part because treating children is less lucrative than treating adults, who
*  order more elective surgeries and are less likely to be on Medicaid.
*  It can be seen in emergency rooms that were understaffed because of budgetary constraints
*  long before the pandemic began.
*  And it can be seen in the push by multi-billion dollar companies like CVS and Walmart to buy
*  or invest in primary care practices, a rapidly consolidating field attractive to investors
*  because many of the patients who seek such care are enrolled in the Medicare Advantage
*  program, which pays out $400 billion to insurers annually.
*  For the past decade, meanwhile, private equity investment in the healthcare industry has
*  searched, a wave of acquisitions that has swept up physician practices, hospitals, outpatient
*  clinics, home health agencies.
*  McNamara estimates that the staffing in 30% of all emergency rooms is now overseen by private
*  equity owned firms.
*  Once in charge, these companies start squeezing the doctors to see more patients per hour,
*  cutting staff, he says.
*  As the focus on revenue and the adoption of business metrics has grown more pervasive,
*  young people embarking on careers in medicine are beginning to wonder if they are the beneficiaries
*  of capitalism or just another exploited class.
*  In 2021, the average medical student graduated with more than $200,000 in debt.
*  In the past, one privileged conferred on physicians who made these sacrifices was the freedom to
*  control their working conditions in independent practices.
*  But today, 70% of doctors work as salaried employees of large hospital systems or corporate
*  entities.
*  Taking orders from administrators and executives do not always share their values or priorities.
*  Philip Sassenheimer, a 30-year-old medical resident at Stanford, told me that these changes
*  had begun to precipitate a shift in self-perception among doctors.
*  In the past, physicians didn't really see themselves as laborers, he notes.
*  They viewed themselves as business owners or scientists as a class above working people.
*  Sassenheimer feels that it is different for his generation because younger doctors realize
*  that they will have far less control over their working conditions than their elders did,
*  that the prestige of their profession won't spare them from the degradation experienced
*  by workers in other sectors of the economy.
*  For our generation, millennials and below, our feeling is that there is a big power imbalance
*  between employers and workers, he says.
*  Last May, the medical residents at Stanford voted to form a union by a tally of 835 to 214.
*  A campaign Sassenheimer enthusiastically supported.
*  We've seen a boom in unionization in many other industries, he told me, and we realize
*  it can level the power dynamics, not just for other workers, but within medicine.
*  One thing that drove this home to him was seeing the nurses at Stanford, who belonged to
*  a union, go on strike to advocate for safer staffing and better working conditions.
*  Their outspokenness stood in striking contrast to the silence of residents, who risked being
*  singled out and disciplined if they dared to say anything that might attract the notice
*  of the administration or their superiors.
*  That's a big reason that unionization is so important, he says.
*  The Stanford example has inspired medical residents elsewhere.
*  Not long ago I spoke with a group of residents in New York City who were thinking about unionizing
*  on the condition that I not disclose their identities or institutional affiliations.
*  Although the medical profession has been slow to diversify, the residents came from strikingly
*  varied backgrounds.
*  Few grew up in wealthy families, judging by the number of hands that went up when I asked
*  if they'd taken on debt to finish medical school.
*  One here at Not, take on debt, set a woman sitting on the carpet in the living room
*  where we gathered, prompting several people to laugh.
*  Having a union, one resident explained, would enable the group to demand better working
*  conditions without having to worry about getting in trouble with their superiors or losing
*  fellowship opportunities.
*  They would be able to advocate for patients rather than apologizing to them for practices
*  they considered shameful, another added.
*  When I asked what they meant by shameful, I learned that a number of the residents had
*  trained at a hospital that served an extremely poor community with a limited number of ICU
*  beds, beds that during the pandemic were sometimes given to wealthy VIP patients from other
*  states, or sicker patients from the surrounding neighborhood languished on the general floor.
*  Forming unions is just one way that patient advocates are finding to push back against
*  such inequities.
*  Critics of private equities growing role in the healthcare system are also closely watching
*  a California lawsuit that could have a major impact.
*  In December 2021, the American Academy of Emergency Medicine Physician Group A-A-E-M-P-G,
*  part of an association of doctors, residents, and medical students, filed a lawsuit accusing
*  Envision Healthcare, a private equity-backed provider, of violating a California statute
*  that prohibits non-medical corporations from controlling the delivery of health services.
*  An equity firms often circumvent these restrictions by transferring ownership on paper to doctors,
*  even as the companies retain control over everything, including the terms of the physician's
*  employment and the rates that patients are charged for care, according to the lawsuit.
*  A-A-E-M-P-G's aim in bringing the suit is not to punish one company, but rather to prohibit
*  such arrangements altogether.
*  We're not asking them to pay money, and we will not accept being paid to drop the case.
*  David Milstein, a lawyer for the A-A-E-M-P-G, has said of the suit.
*  We are simply asking the court to ban this practice model.
*  In May 2022, a judge rejected Envision's motion to dismiss the case, raising hopes that
*  such a ban may take effect.
*  Until the system changes, some doctors are finding ways to opt out.
*  I spoke to several physicians who have started direct care practices in which patients pay
*  a modest monthly fee to see doctors who can offer them more personalized out-of-network
*  care, without having to answer to administrators or insurers.
*  Deanna Grenida, the rheumatologist, to became disillusioned by the astronomical bills her
*  patients kept receiving, started a direct care practice in her specialty in 2020.
*  One afternoon, not long ago, I sat in on a virtual appointment she had with a patient to
*  wish to remain anonymous, a 32-year-old veteran with an athletic bill to begin to experience
*  severe joint pains several months earlier.
*  He asked his primary care physician for a referral to see a rheumatologist after a blood test
*  showed a high level of anti-nuclear antibodies, ANAs, which can be a sign of an autoimmune
*  disorder.
*  He called every doctor's office he could find within a 100-mile radius of his house,
*  but none could schedule him for months.
*  His wife then stumbled upon Grenida's name online and called her office, and he got
*  a virtual appointment the next day.
*  The meeting I sat in on was a follow-up appointment.
*  When it began, Grenida relayed some good news, telling him that his ANA level had fallen,
*  and that his lab results indicated he did not have an autoimmune disease.
*  The patient was visibly relieved, though he was still experiencing persistent pain in
*  his wrist.
*  Grenida advised him to get an MRI, which he said she could order for $800, a fraction
*  of the amount that hospitals typically charged.
*  One advantage of the direct care model was that physicians negotiated with labs and
*  imaging centers for tests and services Grenida told me bypassing the corporate middleman,
*  insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, that drove up health care costs.
*  When he went to medical appointments in the past, Grenida's patient told me later the
*  doctors he saw were often brusque.
*  They come in, tell you the medicine you're going to take, and that's it, he said.
*  His first appointment with Grenida lasted an hour.
*  The minimum amount of time she allotted to all patients in their initial consultations.
*  During the follow-up appointment I observed, Grenida spent half an hour answering his questions.
*  She never cut him off and did not seem rushed or harried.
*  At the end of the appointment he thanked her profusely, and a way that made it clear he
*  was not accustomed to such treatment.
*  It was a novel experience not only for the patient, but also for Grenida.
*  Who told me that in the past, she often had to squeeze appointments into seven minute
*  time slots.
*  Before starting her direct specialty care practice she added, she spent so many hours doing
*  bureaucratic work that she barely had time to see her family, much less her patients.
*  The direct care model is designed to rebuild trust, she said, and to reestablish a normal
*  relationship between physicians and patients.
*  Of course the model is far from a panacea.
*  Many doctors struggle to attract enough patients to make a living, which is a problem for
*  specialists like Grenida who rely on referrals from primary care doctors.
*  Grenida told me she understood why some doctors were choosing to leave the professional
*  together.
*  Two physicians she knew had switched careers recently, and impulse she fears will overcome
*  more and more of her peers in the years to come, especially those who chose to become
*  doctors for altruistic reasons.
