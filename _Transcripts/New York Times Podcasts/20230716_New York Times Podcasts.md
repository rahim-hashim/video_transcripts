# The Sunday Read: ‘The Moral Crisis of America’s Doctors’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoJ2_vE0n7w)
*  Hi, my name is Ayal Press and I'm a contributor to the New York Times magazine.
*  A few years ago, I got this email from a high-ranking official at a hospital that sent me down a
*  rabbit hole.
*  The Times had just published an excerpt from a book of mine called Dirty Work, which examines
*  low-wage, low-status workers in places like the prison system and the meatpacking industry.
*  The book looked not only at the economic challenges these workers face, but also at the moral
*  dilemmas they experience doing their jobs, how it can go against their core values.
*  This hospital official had read my excerpt and they wrote to me, saying there's another
*  group I should look into that might also fit into the topic of dirty work.
*  A group of workers who are going through dilemmas as wrenching as those of border patrol agents
*  and slaughterhouse workers.
*  And they were talking about doctors.
*  At first, I was skeptical.
*  Like really?
*  Physicians who are earning $200,000 salaries and have degrees from Harvard and NYU are
*  experiencing this same level of moral crisis?
*  But I gave this person a call.
*  And that's where this Sunday read begins.
*  The story that I think is familiar to people is that doctors are burning out.
*  They're working too hard, they're seeing too much suffering, and it's wearing on them
*  over long hours and sleepless nights, especially since the pandemic.
*  But that's only part of the story.
*  In this piece for the magazine, I wrote about the ethical quandaries that physicians are
*  finding themselves in as they try to provide care in an American medical system that's
*  increasingly driven by profit.
*  You see it playing out across the country.
*  Pediatric treatment is being whittled down because it's not a moneymaker.
*  Primary care practices are getting bought up by CVS and Amazon.
*  And that's left doctors feeling controlled and pressured to do things that go against
*  their own medical ethics.
*  I spoke with dozens of physicians who said they're finding themselves in extremely uncomfortable
*  situations, like having a seven-minute window to see patients, or being forced to switch
*  a patient to a new medication because that's what their insurance will cover, even when
*  it's dangerous to do that.
*  Or having a patient come to them in tears over an expensive hospital bill that they
*  then have to explain.
*  One provider became emotional, telling me how at her practice, she's so squeezed for
*  time that she can't even sit by a patient's side while they're dying.
*  And so, more and more, doctors are feeling that they're the face of a system they can't
*  morally defend.
*  They've come to feel like scapegoats for the system's inequities.
*  And in some instances, one source told me, they feel that they are acting as the instruments
*  of a system they don't even believe in anymore.
*  Throughout my reporting, all of the doctors I spoke with took pains to say, look, this
*  concerns me primarily because of what it means for my patients, not what it means for me.
*  But doctors also feel like victims of the system, and the numbers very much confirm
*  this, whether it's the alarming suicide rate among physicians, or the number of doctors
*  who are considering quitting and pursuing something else.
*  Since my article came out, I've been flooded with correspondence from doctors, just letter
*  after letter from people telling me they've considered quitting, or they are quitting,
*  or they left the country to go practice medicine in New Zealand or Canada.
*  I haven't gotten a single letter from a doctor saying the system is just fine.
*  In fact, most have told me, you've scratched the surface of how bad things really are,
*  and how bad they're going to get.
*  So here's my article, The Moral Crisis of America's Doctors, read by Eduardo Ballerini.
*  Some years ago, a psychiatrist named Wendy Dean read an article about a physician who
*  died by suicide.
*  Such deaths were distressingly common, she discovered.
*  The suicide rate among doctors appeared to be even higher than the rate among active
*  military members, a notion that startled Dean, who was then working as an administrator at
*  a US Army Medical Research Center in Maryland.
*  Dean started asking the physicians she knew how they felt about their jobs, and many of
*  them confided that they were struggling.
*  Some complained that they didn't have enough time to talk to their patients because they
*  were too busy filling out electronic medical records.
*  Others bemoaned having to fight with insurers about whether a person with a serious illness
*  would be pre-approved for medication.
*  The doctors Dean surveyed were deeply committed to the medical profession, but many of them
*  were frustrated and unhappy, she sensed, not because they were burned out from working
*  but because the health care system made it so difficult to care for their patients.
*  In July 2018, Dean published an essay with Simon G. Talbot, a plastic and reconstructive
*  surgeon that argued that many physicians were suffering from a condition known as moral
*  injury.
*  Military psychiatrists used the term to describe an emotional wound sustained when, in the
*  course of fulfilling their duties, soldiers witnessed or committed acts, raiding a home,
*  killing a noncombatant, that transgressed their core values.
*  Doctors on the front lines of America's profit-driven health care system were also susceptible to
*  such wounds, Dean and Talbot submitted, as the demands of administrators, hospital executives,
*  and insurers forced them to stray from the ethical principles that were supposed to govern
*  their profession.
*  The pull of these forces left many doctors anguished and distraught, caught between the
*  Hippocratic Oath and the realities of making a profit from people at their sickest and
*  most vulnerable.
*  The article was published on STAT, a medical news website with a modest readership.
*  To Dean's surprise, it quickly went viral.
*  Doctors and nurses started reaching out to Dean to tell her how much the article spoke
*  to them.
*  It went everywhere, Dean told me when I visited her last March in Carlisle, Pennsylvania,
*  where she now lives.
*  By the time we met, the distress among medical professionals had reached alarming levels.
*  One survey found that nearly one in five health care workers had quit their job since the
*  start of the pandemic, and that an additional 31 percent had considered leaving.
*  Professional organizations like National Nurses United, the largest group of registered nurses
*  in the country, had begun referring to moral injury and moral distress in pamphlets and
*  news releases.
*  Mona Massoud, a psychiatrist who established a support line for doctors shortly after the
*  pandemic began, recalls being struck by how clinicians reacted when she mentioned the
*  term.
*  I remember all these physicians were like, wow, that is what I was looking for, she says.
*  This is it.
*  Dean's essay caught my eye too, because I spent much of the previous few years reporting
*  on moral injury, interviewing workers in menial occupations whose jobs were ethically compromising.
*  I spoke to prison guards who patrolled the wards of violent penitentiaries, undocumented
*  immigrants who toiled on the kill floors of industrial slaughterhouses, and roustabouts
*  who worked on offshore rigs in the fossil fuel industry.
*  Many of these workers were hesitant to talk or be identified, knowing how easily they
*  could be replaced by someone else.
*  Compared with them, physicians were privileged, earning six-figure salaries and doing prestigious
*  jobs that spared them from the drudgery endured by so many other members of the labor force,
*  including nurses and custodial workers in the healthcare industry.
*  But in recent years, despite the esteem associated with their profession, many physicians have
*  found themselves subjected to practices more commonly associated with manual labors and
*  auto plants and Amazon warehouses, like having their productivity tracked on an hourly basis
*  and being pressured by management to work faster.
*  As doctors are highly skilled professionals who are not so easy to replace, I assumed
*  that they would not be as reluctant to discuss the distressing conditions at their jobs as
*  the low-wage workers I'd interviewed.
*  But the physicians I contacted were afraid to talk openly.
*  I have since reconsidered this and do not feel this is something I can do right now,
*  one doctor wrote to me.
*  Another texted, we'll need to be anon.
*  Some sources I tried to reach had signed nondisclosure agreements that prohibited them from speaking
*  to the media without permission.
*  Others worried they could be disciplined or fired if they angered their employers, a concern
*  that seems particularly well-founded in the growing swath of the healthcare system that
*  has been taken over by private equity firms.
*  In March 2020, an emergency room doctor named Ming Lin was removed from the rotation at
*  his hospital after erring concerns about its COVID-19 safety protocols.
*  Lin worked at St. Joseph Medical Center in Bellingham, Washington, but his actual employer
*  was Team Health, a company owned by the Blackstone Group.
*  ER doctors have found themselves at the forefront of these trends as more and more hospitals
*  have outsourced the staffing in emergency departments in order to cut costs.
*  A 2013 study by Robert McNamara, the chairman of the emergency medicine department at Temple
*  University in Philadelphia, found that 62% of emergency physicians in the United States
*  could be fired without due process.
*  Only 20% of the 389 ER doctors surveyed said they had been threatened for raising quality
*  of care concerns and pressured to make decisions based on financial considerations that could
*  be detrimental to the people in their care, like being pushed to discharge Medicare and
*  Medicaid patients or being encouraged to order more testing than necessary.
*  In another study, more than 70% of emergency physicians agreed that the corporatization
*  of their field has had a negative or strongly negative impact on the quality of care and
*  on their own job satisfaction.
*  There are, of course, plenty of doctors who like what they do and feel no need to speak
*  out.
*  Clinicians in high-paying specialties like orthopedics and plastic surgery are doing
*  just fine, thank you, one physician I know joked.
*  But more and more doctors are coming to believe that the pandemic merely worsened the strain
*  on a health care system that was already failing because it prioritized profits over
*  patient care.
*  They are noticing how the emphasis on the bottom line routinely puts them in moral binds,
*  and young doctors in particular are contemplating how to resist.
*  Some are mulling whether the sacrifices and compromises are even worth it.
*  I think a lot of doctors are feeling like something is troubling them, something deep
*  in their core that they committed themselves to, Dean says.
*  She notes that the term moral injury was originally coined by the psychiatrist Jonathan Shea
*  to describe the wound that forms when a person's sense of what is right is betrayed by leaders
*  in high-stake situations.
*  Not only are clinicians feeling betrayed by their leadership, she says, but when they
*  allow these barriers to get in the way, they are part of the betrayal.
*  They're the instruments of betrayal.
*  Not long ago, I spoke to an emergency physician whom I'll call A about her experience.
*  She did not want her name used, explaining that she knew several doctors who had been
*  fired for voicing concerns about unsatisfactory working conditions or patient safety issues.
*  A soft-spoken woman with a gentle manner, A referred to the emergency room as a sacred
*  A place she loved working because of the profound impact she could have on patients' lives,
*  even those who weren't going to pull through.
*  During her training, a patient with a terminal condition somberly informed her that his daughter
*  couldn't make it to the hospital to be with him in his final hours.
*  A promised the patient that he wouldn't die alone and then held his hand until he passed away.
*  Interactions like that one would not be possible today, she told me, because of the new emphasis
*  on speed, efficiency, and relative value units, RVU, a metric used to measure physician
*  reimbursement that some feel rewards doctors for doing tests and procedures and discourages
*  them from spending too much time on less remunerative functions like listening and talking to patients.
*  It's all about RVUs and going faster, she said of the ethos that permeated the practice
*  where she'd been working.
*  Your door to doctor time, your room to doctor time, your time from initial evaluation to
*  discharge.
*  Appeasing her peers and superiors without breaching her values became increasingly difficult
*  for A. On one occasion, a frail elderly woman came into the ER because she was unable to
*  walk on her own.
*  A nurse case manager determined that the woman should be discharged because she didn't have
*  a specific diagnosis to explain her condition and Medicare wouldn't cover her stay, even
*  though she lived alone and couldn't get out of a chair to eat or go to the bathroom.
*  A cried with the woman and tried to comfort her.
*  Then she pleaded with a hospitalist on duty to admit her.
*  A's appeal was successful, but afterwards she wondered, what are we being asked to do?
*  When we spoke, A had taken a leave from work and was unsure if she would ever go back because
*  of how depleted she felt.
*  It's all about the almighty dollar and all about productivity, she said, which is obviously
*  not why most of us sign up to do the job.
*  That's not always clear to patients, many of whom naturally assume that their doctors
*  are the ones who decide how much time to spend with them and what to charge them for care.
*  Doctors are increasingly the scapegoats of systemic problems within the health care system,
*  Masoud says, because the patient is not seeing the insurance company that denied them the
*  procedure.
*  They're not seeing the electronic medical records that are taking up all of our time.
*  They're just seeing the doctor who can only spend 10 minutes with them in the room, or
*  the doctor who says, I can't get you this medication because it costs $500 a month.
*  And what ends up happening is we internalize that feeling.
*  I spoke to a rheumatologist named Diana Gernita, who found this cycle deeply distressing.
*  Originally from Romania, Gernita came to the United States to do a post-doc at Harvard
*  and was dazzled by the quality of the training she received.
*  Then she began practicing and hearing patients complain about the exorbitant bills they were
*  sent for routine labs and medications.
*  One patient came to her in tears after being billed $7,000 for an IV infusion, for
*  which the patient held her responsible.
*  They have to blame someone, and we are the interface of the system, she said.
*  They think we are the greedy ones.
*  Fed up, Gernita eventually left the practice.
*  Some doctors acknowledged that the pressures of the system had occasionally led them to
*  betray the oaths they took to their patients.
*  Among the physicians I spoke to about this,
*  a 45-year-old critical care specialist named Keith Coral stood out.
*  Raised in a working class town in upstate New York, Coral was an idealist who
*  quit a lucrative job in finance in his early 20s because he wanted to do something that
*  would benefit people.
*  During medical school he felt inspired, watching doctors in the ER and
*  ICU stretch themselves to the breaking point to treat whoever happened to
*  pass through the doors on a given night.
*  I want to do that, he decided instantly, and he did, spending nearly two decades
*  working long shifts as an emergency physician in an array of hospitals,
*  in cities from Providence to Las Vegas to Sacramento, where he now lives.
*  Like many ER physicians, Coral viewed his job as a calling.
*  But over time his idealism gave way to disillusionment,
*  as he struggled to provide patients with the type of care he'd been trained to
*  deliver.
*  Every day you deal with somebody who couldn't get some test or
*  some treatment they needed because they didn't have insurance, he said.
*  Every day you're reminded how savage the system is.
*  Coral was particularly haunted by something that happened in his late 30s,
*  when he was working in the emergency room of a hospital in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.
*  It was a frigid winter night, so cold you could see your breath.
*  The hospital was busy.
*  When Coral arrived for his shift, all of the facility's ER beds were filled.
*  Coral was especially concerned about an elderly woman with pneumonia,
*  who he feared might be slipping into sepsis,
*  an extreme potentially fatal immune response to infection.
*  As Coral was monitoring her, a call came in from an ambulance,
*  informing the ER staff that another patient would soon be arriving,
*  a woman with severe mental health problems.
*  The patient was familiar to Coral.
*  She was a frequent presence in the emergency room.
*  He knew that she had bipolar disorder.
*  He also knew that she could be a handful.
*  On a previous visit to the hospital, she detached the bed rails on her stretcher
*  and fell to the floor, injuring a nurse.
*  In a hospital that was adequately staffed, managing such a situation while
*  keeping tabs on all the other patients might not have been a problem.
*  But Coral was the sole doctor in the emergency room that night.
*  He understood this to be in part a result of cost cutting measures.
*  The hospital has since closed.
*  After the ambulance arrived, he and
*  a nurse began talking with the incoming patient to gauge whether she was suicidal.
*  They determined she was not.
*  But she was combative, arguing with the nurse in an increasingly aggressive tone.
*  As the argument grew more heated, Coral began to fear that if he and
*  the nurse focused too much of their attention on her,
*  other patients would suffer needlessly, and that the woman at risk of septic shock
*  might die.
*  Coral decided he could not let that happen.
*  Exchanging glances, he and the nurse unplugged the patient from the monitor,
*  wheeled her stretcher down the hall, and pushed it out of the hospital.
*  The blast of cold air when the door swung open caused Coral to shudder.
*  A nurse called the police to come pick the patient up.
*  It turned out that she had an outstanding warrant and was arrested.
*  Later, after he returned to the ER, Coral could not stop thinking about what he'd
*  done, imagining how the medical school version of himself would have judged his
*  conduct.
*  He would have been horrified.
*  Concerns about the corporate takeover of America's medical system are hardly new.
*  More than half a century ago, the writers Barbara and
*  John Ehrenreich assailed the power of pharmaceutical companies and
*  other large corporations in what they termed the medical industrial complex.
*  Which, as the phrase suggests, was anything but a charitable enterprise.
*  In the decades that followed,
*  the official bodies of the medical profession seemed untroubled by this.
*  To the contrary, the American Medical Association consistently opposed efforts
*  to broaden access to healthcare after World War II.
*  Undertaking aggressive lobbying campaigns against proposals for
*  a single payer public system, which it saw as a threat to physicians' autonomy.
*  But as the sociologist Paul Starr noted in
*  The Social Transformation of American Medicine, physicians earned the public's
*  trust and derived much of their authority because they were perceived to be
*  above the market and pure commercialism.
*  And in fields like emergency medicine, an ethos of service and self-sacrifice prevailed.
*  At academic training programs, Robert McNamara told me,
*  students were taught that the needs of patients should always come first.
*  That doctors should never allow financial interest to interfere with how they did
*  their jobs.
*  Many of these programs were based in inner city hospitals,
*  whose emergency rooms were often filled with indigent patients.
*  Caring for people regardless of their financial means was both a legal
*  obligation, codified in the Emergency Medical Treatment and
*  Labor Act, a federal law passed in 1986.
*  And in programs like the one McNamara ran at Temple, a point of pride.
*  But he acknowledged that over time, these values increasingly clashed with
*  the reality that residents encountered once they entered the workforce.
*  We're training people to put the patient first, he says, and
*  they're running into a buzzsaw.
*  Throughout the medical system, the insistence on revenue and profits has accelerated.
*  This can be seen in the shuttering of pediatric units at many hospitals and
*  regional medical centers, in part because treating children is less lucrative than
*  treating adults, who order more elective surgeries and
*  are less likely to be on Medicaid.
*  It can be seen in emergency rooms that were understaffed because of
*  budgetary constraints long before the pandemic began.
*  And it can be seen in the push by multi-billion dollar companies like CVS and
*  Walmart to buy or invest in primary care practices.
*  A rapidly consolidating field attractive to investors because many of the patients
*  who seek such care are enrolled in the Medicare Advantage Program,
*  which pays out $400 billion to insurers annually.
*  Over the past decade, meanwhile, private equity investment in the healthcare
*  industry has surged.
*  A wave of acquisitions that has swept up physician practices, hospitals,
*  outpatient clinics, home health agencies.
*  McNamara estimates that the staffing in 30% of all emergency rooms is now
*  overseen by private equity owned firms.
*  Once in charge, these companies start squeezing the doctors to see more
*  patients per hour cutting staff, he says.
*  As the focus on revenue and the adoption of business metrics has grown more
*  pervasive, young people embarking on careers in medicine are beginning to
*  wonder if they are the beneficiaries of capitalism or
*  just another exploited class.
*  In 2021, the average medical student graduated with more than $200,000 in debt.
*  In the past, one privilege conferred on physicians who made these sacrifices was
*  the freedom to control their working conditions in independent practices.
*  But today, 70% of doctors work as salaried employees of large hospital systems or
*  corporate entities, taking orders from administrators and executives who do not
*  always share their values or priorities.
*  Philip Sassenheimer, a 30-year-old medical resident at Stanford, told me that
*  these changes had begun to precipitate a shift in self-perception among doctors.
*  In the past, physicians didn't really see themselves as laborers, he notes.
*  They viewed themselves as business owners or scientists,
*  as a class above working people.
*  Sassenheimer feels that it is different for his generation because younger
*  doctors realize that they will have far less control over their working conditions
*  than their elders did, that the prestige of their profession won't spare them from
*  the degradation experienced by workers in other sectors of the economy.
*  For our generation, millennials and below, our feeling is that there's a big
*  power imbalance between employers and workers, he says.
*  Last May, the medical residents at Stanford voted to form a union by a tally of 835 to 214.
*  A campaign Sassenheimer enthusiastically supported.
*  We've seen a boom in unionization in many other industries, he told me, and
*  we realize it can level the power dynamics, not just for other workers, but within medicine.
*  One thing that drove this home to him was seeing the nurses at Stanford,
*  who belong to a union, go on strike to advocate for safer staffing and
*  better working conditions.
*  Their outspokenness stood in striking contrast to the silence of residents,
*  who risked being singled out and disciplined if they dared to say anything
*  that might attract the notice of the administration or their superiors.
*  That's a big reason that unionization is so important, he says.
*  The Stanford example has inspired medical residents elsewhere.
*  Not long ago, I spoke with a group of residents in New York City who were
*  thinking about unionizing on the condition that I not disclose their identities or
*  institutional affiliations.
*  Although the medical profession has been slow to diversify,
*  the residents came from strikingly varied backgrounds.
*  Few grew up in wealthy families, judging by the number of hands that went up when
*  I asked if they'd taken on debt to finish medical school.
*  Anyone here not take on debt?
*  Said a woman sitting on the carpet in the living room where we gathered,
*  prompting several people to laugh.
*  Having a union, one resident explained, would enable the group to demand better
*  working conditions without having to worry about getting in trouble with their
*  superiors or losing fellowship opportunities.
*  They would be able to advocate for patients rather than apologizing to them
*  for practices they considered shameful, another added.
*  When I asked what they meant by shameful, I learned that a number of the residents
*  had trained at a hospital that served an extremely poor community with a limited
*  number of ICU beds, beds that during the pandemic were sometimes given to wealthy
*  VIP patients from other states, while sicker patients from the surrounding
*  neighborhood languished on the general floor.
*  Forming unions is just one way that patient advocates are finding to push
*  back against such inequities.
*  Critics of private equity's growing role in the healthcare system are also closely
*  watching a California lawsuit that could have a major impact.
*  In December 2021, the American Academy of Emergency Medicine Physician Group,
*  AAEMPG, part of an association of doctors, residents, and medical students,
*  filed a lawsuit accusing Envision Healthcare, a private equity backed provider,
*  of violating a California statute that prohibits non-medical corporations
*  from controlling the delivery of health services.
*  Private equity firms often circumvent these restrictions by transferring
*  ownership on paper to doctors, even as the companies retain control over everything,
*  including the terms of the physician's employment and the rates that patients
*  are charged for care, according to the lawsuit.
*  AAEMPG's aim in bringing the suit is not to punish one company, but rather to
*  prohibit such arrangements altogether.
*  We're not asking them to pay money, and we will not accept being paid to drop
*  the case.
*  David Milstein, a lawyer for the AAEMPG, has said of the suit,
*  In May 2022, a judge rejected Envision's motion to dismiss the case,
*  raising hopes that such a ban may take effect.
*  Until the system changes, some doctors are finding ways to opt out.
*  I spoke to several physicians who have started direct care practices in which
*  patients pay a modest monthly fee to see doctors who can offer them more
*  personalized out-of-network care without having to answer to administrators or
*  insurers.
*  Diana Granita, the rheumatologist who became disillusioned by the astronomical
*  bills her patients kept receiving, started a direct care practice in her
*  specialty in 2020.
*  One afternoon not long ago, I sat in on a virtual appointment she had with a
*  patient who wished to remain anonymous, a 32-year-old veteran with an athletic
*  bill to begin to experience severe joint pain several months earlier.
*  He asked his primary care physician for a referral to see a rheumatologist after a
*  blood test showed a high level of antinuclear antibodies, ANAs, which can be
*  a sign of an autoimmune disorder.
*  He called every doctor's office he could find within a 100-mile radius of his
*  house, but none could schedule him for months.
*  His wife then stumbled upon Granita's name online and called her office, and
*  he got a virtual appointment the next day.
*  The meeting I sat in on was a follow-up appointment.
*  When it began, Granita relayed some good news, telling him that his ANA level had
*  fallen and that his lab results indicated he did not have an autoimmune disease.
*  The patient was visibly relieved, though he was still experiencing persistent
*  pain in his wrist.
*  Granita advised him to get an MRI, which she said she could order for $800,
*  a fraction of the amount that hospitals typically charged.
*  One advantage of the direct care model was that physicians negotiated with labs
*  and imaging centers for tests and services, Granita told me,
*  bypassing the corporate middlemen, insurers, pharmacy benefit managers,
*  that drove up healthcare costs.
*  When he went to medical appointments in the past, Granita's patient told me later,
*  the doctors he saw were often brusque.
*  They come in, tell you the medicine you're going to take, and that's it, he said.
*  His first appointment with Granita lasted an hour, the minimum amount of time she
*  allotted to all patients in their initial consultations.
*  During the follow-up appointment, I observed,
*  Granita spent half an hour answering his questions.
*  She never cut him off and did not seem rushed or harried.
*  At the end of the appointment, he thanked her profusely,
*  in a way that made it clear he was not accustomed to such treatment.
*  It was a novel experience, not only for the patient, but also for
*  Granita, who told me that in the past,
*  she often had to squeeze appointments into seven-minute time slots.
*  Before starting her direct specialty care practice, she added,
*  She spent so many hours doing bureaucratic work that she barely had
*  time to see her family, much less her patients.
*  The direct care model is designed to rebuild trust, she said, and
*  to reestablish a normal relationship between physicians and patients.
*  Of course, the model is far from a panacea.
*  Many doctors struggle to attract enough patients to make a living,
*  which is a problem for specialists like Granita,
*  who rely on referrals from primary care doctors.
*  Granita told me she understood why some doctors were choosing to leave
*  the profession altogether.
*  Two physicians she knew had switched careers recently, an impulse she
*  fears will overcome more and more of her peers in the years to come,
*  especially those who chose to become doctors for altruistic reasons.
*  They didn't quit because they don't like medicine, she said.
*  They were both wonderful physicians.
*  And even running direct care practices, doctors cannot fully escape
*  the frustrations and injustices of the healthcare system.
*  A few months earlier, Granita told me, a patient came to her after
*  having a severe allergic reaction to an ulcer medication that his insurer
*  had switched him onto because it no longer covered the drug he'd been taking.
*  Granita told me she had called her patient's insurer every week as his
*  condition deteriorated.
*  When she finally got through, she was told they needed 30 days to process the appeal.
*  Granita was livid.
*  They are literally putting this patient in danger.
*  It is sick, she said.
*  This is sick medical care.
