# The 1948 Economic Moment That Might Explain Our Own
**New York Times Podcasts:** [February 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH9M5OLvU44)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. This is The Daily.
*  On Friday's show, we explored President Biden's political challenge with a core group of supporters,
*  black voters. Today, his challenge with voters motivated by the economy at a time when it
*  looks good on paper but still feels bad for so many Americans. My colleague, Nate Ko,
*  says that to understand the situation, it helps to look back at another election 76 years ago.
*  It's Monday, February 5th.
*  Nate, we just got the latest batch of economic news on Friday, which showed a surge in hiring,
*  a very strong US labor market. And it really highlighted this conundrum we've talked about a lot
*  on the show, which is that we're living in a pretty healthy economy, and yet voters are still
*  quite sour on the economy. And now that we've entered this general election phase of the
*  presidential campaign, that dynamic looms as a pretty major question mark over the entire race,
*  because it doesn't feel like we have a precedent for it. Does this sentiment help Trump? Does it
*  help Biden? But you say, Nate, we actually do have a precedent for this, this weird economy in an
*  election year. It has happened before. So just explain. Yes, it has. But I've been searching for
*  a long time to find a economic and political moment that resembles the economy we have today. And
*  that's been really hard because, you know, in the era of modern consumer confidence data, there just
*  isn't an economy like this one. There isn't an economy that has this weird combination of low
*  unemployment, high economic growth and a dissatisfied electorate. But I wound up digging
*  just a little bit further back, just before the era of modern consumer confidence data, and I did
*  find an economic moment that actually bore a lot of resemblance to the economy today. And it also
*  had very similar political characteristics to what we see today with a dissatisfied country under
*  circumstances that look a lot like what we've seen since the pandemic. And it happened to be an
*  election year and a very famous election year at that. Okay, first of all, congratulations, that
*  seems like a really big find. Thank you. What is the year? The year is 1948. So post war, but just
*  barely. Just barely. And like the post pandemic economy, the post war economy after World War Two
*  was really weird. Housewives shopping for their holiday dinners found food prices 40% higher than
*  18 months ago. The end of wartime rationing led all of these consumers to immediately start buying
*  goods again, and led inflation to skyrocket. Trying to replenish their wardrobes, Americans found
*  clothing up 19%. You know, at the same time, all these troops had come home from overseas, and they
*  were looking for housing and there was a housing shortage. Against the twin handicaps of spiraling
*  costs and material shortages. There is no veteran problem more pressing than housing. And a lot of
*  that is like what we see today. Obviously, the housing market is really tight right now. And more
*  generally, this is the only moment in the era of modern economic data, when a president oversaw an
*  economy with inflation over 7%, while unemployment stayed under 4%. And the economy kept growing like
*  it did today. There's no other example like it.
*  So on paper 1948 and 2024 have just a tremendous amount of economic similarity.
*  Yeah, and I think that one thing that I think is charming about the example is that the source of
*  this weird set of economic conditions was sort of fundamentally similar, both the end of the
*  pandemic, and the end of the war economy brought these disruptions that led to the distortions in
*  prices led to the distortions in the housing market, and left Americans feeling strangely
*  dissatisfied, even though by other measures like unemployment or growth, things look pretty good.
*  You know, and at the time, Harry Truman was president, he was a democrat, he took over after
*  the death of FDR in 1945. And in large part because of prices and the economy, Harry Truman's
*  popularity collapsed. He started out with a 90% approval rating after World War Two, but by the
*  early part of his election year in 1948, his approval rating was all the way down to 36%.
*  Well, not unlike, correct me if I'm wrong, you're the polling expert, President Biden today.
*  That's right. It's very similar. Joe Biden's approval rating right now is in the upper 30s. So
*  that's right next to where Harry Truman was at the time. It's worth dwelling on just how remarkable
*  the public's dissatisfaction with the economy was. I mean, we think of the post war era as being the
*  dawn of this really prosperous time for Americans, which in retrospect, it certainly was, but
*  Americans were so pessimistic about the economy, they thought a depression was likely, and more
*  than 70% of Americans said they wanted their own wages to go down, if that's what it would take in
*  order to bring down prices.
*  Wow. Okay, so weird post war economy, highly dissatisfied public, and you mentioned this was an
*  election year. So Truman, politically speaking, is in real trouble.
*  Yeah, deep trouble. The Democratic coalition has fallen apart. He's seen in his way in over his head.
*  And then you take one high profile example, The New Republic, then a very prominent liberal
*  magazine, you know, argued that he's just leave the race altogether and not even run for re-election.
*  But of course, he doesn't leave the race. He's left facing an opponent in Republican Thomas Dewey,
*  who he seems very likely to lose to. He's trailing in the polls. He's in a lot of trouble heading
*  right up to the election.
*  So amid this toxic economic feeling moment that seems so lethal for Truman, what happens?
*  Well, things start to turn around. The economy stages a big comeback. Inflation plummets.
*  Inflation is at 10% in January 1948, and it falls in half by October. And voters perceived that.
*  They reported to pollsters that they expected prices to rise when it was the summer. And by the
*  time the election came around, they weren't expecting additional price increases. And with
*  that economic backdrop, Truman runs one of the most famous campaigns in American political
*  history.
*  Let's take a look at the record of the 80th Congress they're so proud of. I call it the Notorious
*  Do Nothing Republican 80th Congress.
*  You may remember from your US history class that he runs against the Do Nothing Congress. The
*  thing that Congress wasn't doing was taking action to control prices.
*  That's the true story of why prices are so high.
*  So he runs a populist campaign to try and argue that the Republicans aren't standing up for
*  working people. And despite all of that, Truman still trails in the polls his rival, the
*  Republican Thomas Dewey all the way up until the end.
*  Governor Thomas E. Dewey, proclaimed as the overwhelming paperette, records his own vote
*  with calm confidence.
*  The expectation that Dewey is going to win is so strong that there are even newspapers printed
*  before the election is over that say Dewey defeats Truman. But in the end, through the day
*  and far into the night, the results come in state by state until the news that confounded the
*  experts and the prophets, Truman wins.
*  Harry Truman wins in what's arguably the most famous comeback in American political history.
*  So, Neith, how much is President Biden on this kind of a Truman economic improvement, political
*  fortune revival path or not?
*  Economically, I think there's a really good case that Biden is on the Truman path or even ahead
*  of schedule. Inflation has been steadily declining already over the last year.
*  You know, as I just mentioned a moment ago, inflation was still at 10 percent in January
*  1948. And inflation today is already down under four percent and may still be expected to
*  fall heading into the election.
*  And there are already signs that voters are beginning to respond to the positive economic news.
*  We just got new consumer confidence data over the last few days, and it shows that consumer
*  sentiment has risen to the highest level since 2021, which is, of course, the year that post
*  pandemic inflation really began to set in.
*  And it also happens to be the last time Joe Biden's approval rating was over 50 percent.
*  And importantly, Americans expect that inflation is going to continue to decline.
*  So there's this sort of sense that maybe we've gotten through the toughest part here and
*  brighter days are ahead.
*  And these gains in consumer sentiment are broad.
*  It's up across every age group, every income group and every educational group.
*  So those are very positive signs for Joe Biden if he wanted to try and pull off something
*  like what Harry Truman was able to pull off in 48.
*  So this very much does seem to be a largely analogous trajectory economically
*  speaking, 1948, 2024 Democrat Harry Truman, Democrat Joe Biden.
*  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, that doesn't mean they're the exact same election.
*  There are all kinds of differences.
*  Truman had to overcome challenges that Biden won't have to overcome.
*  Biden will have to overcome challenges that Harry Truman didn't have to overcome.
*  And one of the biggest differences here is that Joe Biden owns the blame for inflation
*  in a way that Harry Truman didn't.
*  Why not? Well, you know, as I mentioned, Harry Truman was able to blame Congress.
*  He said he had the solution to inflation in a way that Joe Biden simply can't say today.
*  But one of the biggest differences and what may prevent history from repeating itself
*  today is that the economy just is not nearly as powerful as it once was in shaping electoral
*  outcomes. And so even if Biden is able to replicate Truman's exact same economic
*  fortune, it may not be enough for him to win re-election.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Now, you just said that a major difference between 1948 and now 2024 and whether or not
*  Biden is or is not Truman in this election has a lot to do with the economy.
*  And you suggested that it's not as powerful a force in elections as it had been in the
*  past. And that's surprising.
*  I mean, everything we have been told as political journalists and as Americans is that it's
*  the economy, stupid, right?
*  The economy is decisive in elections.
*  So you're just going to have to explain yourself.
*  The economy is absolutely a huge factor in shaping our elections still.
*  But it's not the only thing that matters.
*  And over time, there have been more and more signs that the economy has become a little
*  less important in shaping the outcome of our elections.
*  And what are those signs?
*  Well, one easy sign that I think we can all see in our everyday lives is the approval
*  ratings of our presidents.
*  Take Donald Trump.
*  Donald Trump presided over an excellent economy, an economy that apparently is so good
*  that many voters are yearning for it again today.
*  But his approval ratings were never over 50 percent.
*  There's nothing like that in the longer term historic record, right?
*  That's something that's very different that we see today that we haven't seen in the
*  past. And it's a sign that there are other things that are shaping political opinions
*  about the president that just didn't exist decades ago.
*  Now, some of that could be about the specifics of Donald Trump or Joe Biden or Barack Obama.
*  But when it happens now for three straight presidents, that's when you start to wonder
*  whether it's not really about anything about them, but something deeper happening in
*  American politics.
*  I just want to be clear. So over the last three presidencies, Biden, Trump, Obama,
*  you're seeing more and more of a disconnect between the health of the economy and the
*  president's approval ratings, which used to be a lot more of a kind of one to one
*  relationship. Economy was good.
*  Approval ratings, good economy was bad.
*  Approval ratings bad. You're saying that relationship has kind of ruptured a little
*  bit. It's not just ruptured.
*  It's almost gone over the last three presidents.
*  Well, why is that?
*  I mean, what explains why this economic relationship to presidential approval ratings
*  is evaporating?
*  Well, in a certain sense, the answer is obvious.
*  You know, it's that we live in a more polarized country that's deeply divided on a
*  pretty long set of ideologically charged issues that voters care a lot about.
*  Going back to the example about Donald Trump, I don't think that our listeners should
*  have any difficulty imagining all of the reasons why voters disapproved of Donald Trump,
*  even though the economy was good.
*  There were his views on immigration.
*  There was his conduct in office.
*  There's also just the general backdrop of deeply polarized country where there are far
*  fewer persuadable voters.
*  Mm hmm.
*  There are things like this for Joe Biden as well.
*  There are voters who have a lot of skepticism about his age.
*  There are people who are concerned about his stance on Israel.
*  There are people who are concerned about immigration and the border.
*  There's a lot of different reasons why voters can disapprove of Joe Biden, even though
*  they think that the economy is pretty decent.
*  And indeed, in 1948, for what it's worth, Harry Truman had a lot of issues like this.
*  Civil rights was becoming an issue in 1948.
*  The first Israeli Arab war and Israel's existence was also in 1948.
*  But the number of voters who care about these issues and now vote on them is much higher
*  than it used to be.
*  Hmm.
*  In a polarized America where perhaps a more and more nationalized and partisan media
*  exists, what you're describing is an environment in which non-economic issues become
*  more central to people's identity, more central to how they vote.
*  Yeah.
*  And, you know, it's worth thinking about a sociological element here, too, which is that
*  Americans are much more affluent and highly educated than they were in 1948.
*  Back in 1948, fewer than 10% of Americans had graduated college.
*  And most people didn't have deeply informed views on these kind of arcane social issues.
*  They might have had some view, but it wasn't nearly as important to them as getting their
*  weekly paycheck and providing a basic standard of living for their families.
*  And today, in 2024, more than 40% of voters will come from households making more than
*  $100,000 a year.
*  This combination of material affluence and high education creates a set of conditions
*  where voters have the privilege, as people like to say, the luxury of voting on non-economic
*  issues and the knowledge of the issues that would allow them to care about them, to treat
*  politics like a sport and to value these kind of ideological questions more than they would
*  have in the past.
*  Okay, so who in 2024, given everything you just explained, does the economy matter to
*  most?
*  Well, everyone cares about the economy a little bit, right?
*  But not everyone has the luxury to care about other issues.
*  And not everyone has deeply well-informed views of those other issues like abortion or the
*  border and so on.
*  And the people who care about the economy but don't have the same kind of ideological
*  politics tend to be working class.
*  It's not that there's no one who's working class that cares about these things, of course.
*  And it's not that everyone who's highly educated and rich cares about abortion.
*  But you're much more likely to be persuadable on the economy if you have lower educational
*  attainment and you have lower levels of income.
*  Okay, so you're saying unlike, presumably, 1948, today there are just fewer voters who
*  are persuadable based on economic issues alone or primarily, and the ones who are tend to
*  be lower income and have lower education levels.
*  So I guess the question is, are those voters even really available to President Biden?
*  Because we tend to think of them as Trump voters.
*  Is that understanding correct?
*  Yeah, that's absolutely right.
*  I mean, Donald Trump's political strength is among working class voters and then on
*  the economic issue in particular, he's always had an advantage over Joe Biden on who would
*  handle the economy best.
*  And we haven't said this explicitly, but it's worth noting that there are a lot of polls
*  showing Joe Biden really weak among low income voters.
*  And that shouldn't be too much of a surprise given his poor economic ratings and the basic
*  theory of modern politics that I've outlined to you.
*  But Democrats usually do best among low income voters.
*  So if the economy turns around, you're hoping if you're Joe Biden, that you start to do
*  better among those low income, traditionally Democratic voters, the sort of people who
*  voted for Harry Truman in 1948, who were voting for the Democrats because they thought the
*  Democrats were the party of the working class and were good for their material interests.
*  Got it. So you're saying, yes, these voters have tended to vote for Trump in the past,
*  but that's not set in stone.
*  They are potentially persuadable and in fact, an improving economy could bring them
*  into Joe Biden's camp.
*  That's right. An improving economy could change the math here.
*  The risk for Donald Trump is pretty serious.
*  If the economy becomes less important to voters, then his biggest advantage goes away
*  among the group he usually counts on in order to win elections.
*  Donald Trump's going to win voters out of college degree no matter what happens.
*  Right. I'm not saying that Joe Biden's going to go and win the white working class or
*  something like that. But whether Donald Trump can generate huge margins among that group,
*  whether he can keep gaining among that group, that's what keeps him in the game.
*  That's what gives him a chance to win the election.
*  What I think is interesting is we're seeing an awareness already from Trump that this is
*  a problem for him. You know, the other day he said something about how some of the recent
*  gains in the stock market we've seen can actually be attributed to the polls showing him
*  in the lead. That's the sort of thing you say when you
*  know the economy is really important to you and you want to make sure that if it is
*  improving, Joe Biden doesn't get credit for it.
*  Right. I think what he said specifically was that the rising stock market was a Trump stock
*  market because it was a stock market reacting to the assumption that he would win, which
*  felt like a little bit of a stretch. But what you're saying is that is a sign that Trump
*  recognizes that a kind of rising economic fortune for Biden is bad for him.
*  And he needs to come up with some sort of plan to do something about it.
*  And that's a struggle. Yeah, I mean, it's almost better than any
*  consumer sentiment poll that we've got.
*  Right. I mean, if Donald Trump knows that he can't pretend like the economy is bad, that
*  says something about how credible he thinks that side of the argument is.
*  Fascinating. So really, just to return to our 1948 example for a moment, the difference
*  with today is the scale of voters who may be persuaded based on economic conditions.
*  In 1948, a whole lot of voters felt much happier by the time the election rolled around.
*  And so that may well have convinced a lot of them to reelect Harry Truman and swayed
*  the election in his favor. Today, that number of people who can be persuaded by the economy
*  alone is a lot smaller, as you've explained, but both candidates would still love to have
*  their support, especially in a close race, which we expect to have.
*  So what we're likely to see now, if the economy keeps improving, is a pretty robust fight.
*  And I guess we're already starting to see it over who should get the credit for it,
*  Biden or Trump.
*  Yeah, I think we could see something like that.
*  But look, Biden is likely going to get the credit for an improving economy, not Trump.
*  Biden's the president. Trump can try and spin the stock market all day.
*  But that's going to be a tough sell for the American people.
*  I think that if you're Biden, if the economy continues to improve, that's probably going to
*  help him to some extent or another. It could even be the foundation for his re-election.
*  But remember, we're talking about a persuadable group of voters, not single issue voters.
*  We can't assume that just because the economy improves, it means Biden's going to win.
*  There are other issues that can sway these voters. The border, Biden's age, the war in Israel,
*  or something else. It's not so simple as to say that their vote will be dictated exclusively by
*  the economy. But I think it's fair to say that with all of the huge issues that loom over the
*  country today and how polarized our country is, that an improving economy may not be the same
*  kind of wind in Joe Biden's sales that it was for Harry Truman in 1948.
*  Well, Nate, thank you very much for the history lesson and the analysis. We appreciate it.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to another day. Over the weekend, the United States and its allies
*  carried out a barrage of attacks on Iranian forces and the militias they support.
*  The strikes began on Friday, targeting sites in Syria and Iraq in response to attacks that
*  killed three American soldiers in Jordan and injured at least 40 more U.S. troops.
*  The attacks continued on Saturday and Sunday, with U.S. strikes against dozens of targets in Yemen
*  controlled by the Iranian-backed Houthi militia, which has continued to threaten global shipping
*  in the Red Sea. While the United States says that it is not looking to widen the war in the Middle
*  East, the strikes over the past three days represent a clear escalation that American
*  officials said was far from over. So I don't have anything to share with you today on precisely
*  who was taken out in those strikes, but I would just say that the president was clear
*  when he ordered them and when he conducted them that that was the beginning of our response and
*  there will be more steps to come. And in the first Democratic presidential primary,
*  President Biden thoroughly dominated his rivals in South Carolina, winning more than 96 percent
*  of the vote. Biden's campaign team was especially interested in the turnout of Black voters,
*  who polls show are less enthusiastic about him than in the past. Biden's aides said that early
*  data from Saturday's primary showed that the share of Black voters in South Carolina was 13 percent
*  higher than in 2020. Today's episode was produced by Alex Stern, Muge Zadie, Claire Tenesqueda,
*  and Mary Wilson. It was edited by Devin Taylor with help from Patricia Willens, was fact-checked
*  by Susan Lee, contains original music by Rowan and Mistow and Marian Lozano, and was engineered by
*  Chris Wood. Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landfurb of Wonderly.
*  That's it for the Daily. I'm Michael Boborio. See you tomorrow.
