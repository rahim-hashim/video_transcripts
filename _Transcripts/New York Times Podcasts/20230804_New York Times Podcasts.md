*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tevernici, and this is The Daily.
*  The wildfires that have swept Canada this summer have become the largest in modern history.
*  The scale has forced an international response and a re-evaluation of how the world manages
*  wildfires.
*  Today, we talk to firefighters on the front lines about the enormity of their challenge.
*  And, to climate columnists, David Wallace Wells about how, thanks to climate change,
*  the very nature of the danger from wildfires is shifting.
*  It's Friday, August 4.
*  My name is Ben Oakley.
*  I'm 43 years old.
*  I'm the system-based manager with the Boisey-Belam smoke-champers.
*  I've been in wildland fires since 2000.
*  My name's Cole Wheelan.
*  I'm 32 and I live in Boisey, Idaho.
*  I'm a senior smoke-champere for Boise, Bureau of Land Management.
*  So, we're an initial attack resource that responds to usually remote lightning fires
*  by airplane and parachute.
*  My name's Ash Mara.
*  I'm a fly aviation specialist with the New South of Israel-Flozoros, Vice-Hare in Sydney.
*  So, I'm Jake Meary.
*  I work with the Alaska smoke-champers.
*  I'm 31 years old.
*  I started fire when I was 19 right out of high school.
*  And currently on the wildfire right now.
*  You know, we started hearing about Canada in June.
*  We went up there for a total of 19 days and there was probably another 30 smoke-champers
*  from the other bases that were up there during my time as well.
*  So, I was there for 14 operational periods.
*  Yeah, they need kind of all hands-on deck, really.
*  There was a lot of international aid.
*  And I think there's like French and South African.
*  When we got to Edmonton, we were breaks on our individual assignments.
*  From there, we were kind of out with all the equipment we needed.
*  And I basically began working as soon as I got there.
*  You know, we all kind of have our duties in our roles.
*  There's people that operate chain-sauz.
*  And there's other people that man the pump-and-hose and then hand tools.
*  And then another thing Canada, they have a lot of access to helicopters and air resources.
*  Because a lot of that stuff is pretty remote.
*  It did look quite confrante when we arrived to our fire.
*  You're talking enormous flames of smoke.
*  You can see flames run up through the air.
*  And usually if you can see flames from the air when you're flying,
*  that means it's pretty intense on the ground.
*  The fire itself, from flying where we were,
*  you can nearly go as far as you can see.
*  One of the surprising things is how bad British Columbia is.
*  Just by all the country, we're out across the landscape.
*  You can say anywhere from like 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. 6 p.m.
*  is kind of when the fire would pick up and kind of stand up and move.
*  It's so dry and windy that it's burning the grass right over a swamp.
*  You know, the grass is burning right on top of the water,
*  which is pretty wild to see.
*  I ended up jumping a fire that went pretty big.
*  I spent like 11 days on one fire and it was kind of chaos.
*  It was really volatile, burning really quick.
*  And you know, the fire kept throwing spots, you know,
*  hot embers into unburned fuels.
*  And we were just running around trying to contain them all.
*  It was right along the Elasca, Canadian Highway.
*  So that was the main resource we were trying to protect,
*  just because it's kind of the bloodline for Northern Canada and up to Alaska.
*  And yeah, we were just pulling long shifts, you know, 20-hour shifts,
*  18-hour shifts, 17-hour shifts, back to 20, trying to contain it.
*  And I think it was on day 10.
*  We finally got up way around the fire and the line held,
*  which is really nice because there's a lot of chaotic days,
*  you know, we're so short staff.
*  We just were kind of barely holding onto it, just keeping it at ease.
*  It's such a vast area up there, and they're so big,
*  and they're growing at such a rate.
*  At that point, sometimes it's an even lot of cause,
*  and then you're going to need what we call a season ending event.
*  And that's going to require the turn of the season, rain and snow.
*  And we're going to have to put it in order to actually put it out.
*  With how much activity that they had up there,
*  they could have had every firefighter in the world up there,
*  and it's, you know, it's still wouldn't have been enough
*  to help just with how much activity and how much, you know,
*  how much fire is burning up there right now.
*  So David, the last time you and I spoke,
*  it was about the smoke that was covering huge parts of the United States.
*  At the time, you know, New York City was this kind of angry orange color.
*  And of course, it had come from forest fires in Canada.
*  Which continued today to burn out of control.
*  So after that show, my colleagues Carlos Prieto and Austin Tutorvati
*  started calling firefighters who were fighting fires in Canada.
*  And I wanted to ask you the same question.
*  My colleagues put to these firefighters,
*  which is how do we finally put these fires out?
*  Well, the truth is we've never been able to put fires like this out ever,
*  even in California where we have the most advanced wildland firefighting system
*  anywhere in the world, even there when a fire is burning totally out of control.
*  Firefighters just can't get in the way of that.
*  They can't extinguish those fires at all.
*  The flames themselves are moving too fast.
*  The fires are burning too hot.
*  When you get into a situation like that,
*  really the best that firefighters can do is to try to work on the margins
*  to direct the path of the fire away from human settlements
*  and to wait for the winds to change.
*  And in British Columbia, which is the equivalent state of California in Canada,
*  they have less than one-tenth the budget of Cal Fire.
*  And they've got a fraction of the firefighters.
*  So even in the place in the world where we can do the best,
*  we can't manage truly disastrous fires.
*  We can extinguish them.
*  We certainly can't do that in Canada where the resources are much, much smaller.
*  And what's the size of the fire at this point there in Canada?
*  So in total, we've seen across Canada,
*  something like 30 million acres burn.
*  30 million acres.
*  It's unbelievably large.
*  It's about three times as much land as has burned in the worst American fire seasons
*  of the last 50 years.
*  Holy.
*  And we still have a few months of fire season ahead of us,
*  which means we may well get to 40 million or even 50 million by the time the year is over.
*  And you already have a lot of Canadian fire scientists saying
*  the climate has changed sufficiently that we can't even really expect
*  that the rainy season will totally bring this to an end.
*  So we don't know when these fires are really going to go out,
*  but already they are literally off the charts.
*  They are chart redefining.
*  Wow, the scale of it is just mind blowing.
*  So if you can't put them out,
*  if they're wild and completely out of control as they are,
*  I guess the question is, what can you do?
*  Like what's the strategy?
*  Well, if you put yourself in the shoes of someone who's trying to allocate scarce resources
*  to deal with an overwhelming threat,
*  you prioritize what you're going to defend.
*  And that's basically what the Canadians have done.
*  It's also what we've done in a lot of places in the US and recent years,
*  which is to say we focus on human lives,
*  make sure that we can save them and protect them.
*  We focus secondarily on homes, you know, towns,
*  make sure that fires don't destroy whole communities.
*  And then as a third level,
*  we try to focus on protecting human infrastructure,
*  rail lines, power lines, other sorts of things that we don't want to get destroyed by fire.
*  But it is really important, I think, to understand in thinking about this challenge,
*  just how large and vast and mostly uninhabited most of Canada is,
*  and how much of it is really untouched forest.
*  I think it's 85% of Canadians live within 150 miles of the US border,
*  which is the equivalent of 85% of Americans living south of Los Angeles and south of Tampa.
*  And then you have this untouched landscape to the north.
*  And when you're talking about allocating scarce resources,
*  it's obvious that you want to focus on protecting the people where they're densely populated.
*  And really, as strange as it may sound,
*  just counterintuitive as it may sound,
*  let the rest of the country burn.
*  Wow.
*  So letting the forest burn is, in fact, the strategy,
*  which is not exactly intuitive, as you say,
*  how did we get to this idea of how to manage fire?
*  Well, it came out of the realization that we took the wrong approach
*  from most of the 20th century, extinguishing fire wherever it cropped up.
*  We had this kind of a daredevil response
*  where we'd send in mostly young men into areas
*  even where we knew the fire was going to burn out of control
*  and try to extinguish it whenever we could.
*  We risked a lot of lives to do that.
*  We suppressed fire really successfully,
*  but it also meant as a result that because there was less fire,
*  the landscape itself grew more and more flammable over time.
*  In a natural world untouched by this kind of firefighting,
*  there would be occasional small-scale fires that thinned out dry timber.
*  But if we put out all those fires and those burns don't happen,
*  the tinder just accumulates larger and larger
*  and that means that when an emission finally happens,
*  the fire that results can burn much, much larger
*  and as a result, much more intensely
*  because there's just so much more of that fuel on the ground.
*  But about 30, 40, 50 years ago,
*  there was a sort of a change in perspective
*  on exactly how to approach these challenges
*  and now most firefighters, almost everywhere in the world,
*  take a very different approach rather than trying to put out fire
*  wherever it burns.
*  They focus on protecting human life when they can
*  and human communities where they can.
*  And otherwise, they try to cultivate what they call good fire.
*  Good fire.
*  Yeah, good fire is fire that thinns out forests
*  that is already ready to burn.
*  As a result, it can allow those forests to regenerate.
*  It's part of the natural cycle from any of these forests
*  to go through some amount of burning.
*  And it can also protect against future
*  out of control catastrophic fires
*  because once an area of land is burned,
*  it was often thought that it would take a very long time
*  for it to burn again.
*  And in the meantime, that burned area
*  would act as a natural fire break
*  so that if a future fire broke out a mile down the road,
*  it wouldn't actually cross that burned over area.
*  It would stay contained within the boundaries
*  of what had already burned.
*  And in addition to letting those fires burn
*  to produce that effect,
*  firefighters have also tried to introduce their own good fire
*  through what's called controlled burning,
*  which is where given the right weather conditions,
*  you kind of set up an area and light it on fire,
*  knowing that there aren't going to be high wind days,
*  knowing that you've built up particular fire breaks
*  in certain areas so that you know that the fire
*  that will result will be contained.
*  It's not foolproof.
*  There have been mistakes made here
*  and there've been some really quite large fires
*  that emerged from controlled burns.
*  But in general,
*  it's understood that this has been a healthier approach
*  to forest management and fire policy.
*  Okay, so the idea was to limit the amount of fuel
*  for a potential wildfire before it started
*  through these controlled burns
*  to kind of lower the chance of an out of control fire
*  in the future.
*  And also that once a fire does start
*  to stop it from burning near towns and cities.
*  So that's what the firefighters are doing up there right now.
*  They're protecting people, right?
*  Kind of like a defending army or something.
*  Yeah, and I think they've done a relatively good job of that
*  given how much of Canada is burning.
*  We've seen a few fatalities, but it's not in a high number.
*  We haven't seen whole towns incinerated
*  like we've seen in previous fire seasons in Canada or the US.
*  And you know, we've seen a massive amount of land burn
*  and that's sort of reflective of the strategy.
*  So according to the lessons
*  that we thought we learned over the last 30, 40 years,
*  things are basically going according to plan here.
*  The problem is these fires in Canada are showing us
*  that there are unforeseen costs to that strategy.
*  And the lessons that we thought we learned
*  over those previous generations
*  simply don't apply to the climate reality
*  as it exists today.
*  And managing fire is becoming a much riskier proposition.
*  We'll be right back.
*  OK, so David, walk me through the way that climate change
*  is scrambling or thinking about fires.
*  Well, the most basic level is just that
*  because there is more heat and often less moisture
*  far as in much of the world are becoming more flammable.
*  So that means that they are burning more regularly.
*  And when they burn, they often burn more intensely,
*  which is to say they have higher temperatures.
*  You can't even drop water on some of them
*  from airplanes that are designed to extinguish them
*  because the water will actually evaporate
*  before it even reaches the fire.
*  Wow.
*  You have, you know, it burning so hot that the silica
*  in the soil can turn into glass.
*  And you have this whole new phenomenon of fire weather.
*  We used to use the word fire weather to describe
*  when a fire was likely to start.
*  Now we use it to describe the fact that
*  whole weather systems are produced
*  by the convective heat produced by fires.
*  And so you have fire tornadoes, fire lightning storms.
*  You have these particular kinds of clouds,
*  which can rise all the way up into the stratosphere,
*  producing new fire conditions over much larger areas.
*  So we're living under a completely different set
*  of climate conditions in terms of the fires that start
*  when they start and how far they can burn.
*  And then also the character and quality of the fire
*  when they are burning.
*  Okay.
*  So fire tornadoes, huge fire clouds.
*  What other new phenomenon are we seeing now?
*  Well, a lot of stuff is changing.
*  One of the things that scares me most is something
*  that's often called a zombie fire,
*  where a fire can seem extinguished on the surface,
*  especially as the fall goes into winter,
*  but it actually burns in the soil
*  and springs up again in the spring.
*  So kind of sneak attack.
*  Exactly.
*  And this has happened a lot in Siberia.
*  It's happened in the American West, too.
*  And we don't really know how much more common
*  that's going to be.
*  I mean, a zombie fire by definition, scary, undead fires.
*  And we're also seeing some other concerning phenomenon
*  so we used to believe that once an area had burned,
*  it would take quite a long time for it
*  to recover sufficiently to burn again.
*  It might be a 10-year horizon, it may be a 30-year horizon,
*  but now we're seeing increasingly in certain areas,
*  even just a few years after a previous bad fire,
*  a new fire coming in and burning once more.
*  So we used to feel for all of its horror and tragedy
*  that a massive wildfire at least protected that land
*  for basically a generation.
*  And now it seems much, much less safe
*  to count on that generational buffer.
*  So how does all of this change the calculus on fire management?
*  Well, on a practical level,
*  it means that you can't do controlled burns
*  as aggressively as you might have wanted to do.
*  The number of days in which conditions are comfortable
*  for burning are many fewer
*  and the risks of things getting out of control are higher.
*  It's also the case that letting a natural fire continue to burn
*  runs a risk of it growing much larger and more intense
*  than would have been the case a generation ago
*  because it's going to just find more fuel on the landscape
*  than was the case back then.
*  And the impact of that is twofold,
*  and I think these are things that we've only just started
*  to really reckon with.
*  The first is about smoke.
*  We've only started to think about the public health risks
*  of wildfire smoke over the last few years.
*  And it's one thing to say what we're trying to do
*  is to protect human life when we define human life
*  as the person standing in the path of fire
*  and think what can we do to protect that person.
*  And it's another thing to think we need to do what we can
*  to protect human life when the human lives
*  that we're trying to protect are the many millions of people
*  living hundreds of miles away who may breathe in that smoke.
*  In the first instance, it's kind of okay
*  to let good fire burn if no one's in the way.
*  In the second instance, letting more land burns
*  is going to produce more smoke,
*  which is going to ultimately affect more people.
*  And it's not just smoke.
*  It's also carbon because trees, when they burn,
*  release carbon as reliably as burning a piece of cold is.
*  And the effects there at the global level are not enormous,
*  but in particular bad fire seasons,
*  they can be really, really catastrophic.
*  In Canada this year, they're producing two or three times
*  as much emissions as the entire Canadian economy,
*  all of its infrastructure, all of its energy systems,
*  all of its transportation, all of its agriculture,
*  all of its factories, all of its cars.
*  More carbon is being produced by wildfires this year
*  in Canada than all of those other sources combined.
*  So that's the scale of the carbon problem produced by fires.
*  And we're just beginning, I think, to even think about it
*  and we're very far from getting a policy or cultural hold on it.
*  I mean, it's startling, right?
*  I mean, just to repeat, so people actually absorb this.
*  The emissions from fires this season in Canada are two or three times
*  as much as the emissions as the entire Canadian economy,
*  which is just like the scale is unimaginable and depressing.
*  So what's the cost of this let it burn strategy globally?
*  Recent years, there have been estimates that the emissions from wildfires
*  are larger than the national emissions of all countries except China,
*  the United States and India, which is to say if wildfires were a country,
*  they would be the world's fourth biggest emitter.
*  And it means that if you're casting your mind forward,
*  a generation or two into a world in which we've actually done a remarkably rapid job of decarbonization
*  and are not producing very much or any additional carbon emissions,
*  we still may be dealing with future heating, future global warming,
*  just from the effects of wildfire continuing to burn at higher and higher levels
*  and producing more and more carbon.
*  So the cost of not putting out these fires, you know,
*  doing the good burn thing is really starting to add up.
*  What options do we actually have when we think about forest fire management
*  and how we need to change it?
*  Unfortunately, I don't think there are great options out there.
*  People talk about the possibility of logging to reduce the fuel load,
*  but of course, logging produces carbon because every time you cut down a tree or releases that carbon,
*  there are people who want to thin out the forests,
*  but the effort it would take to actually go through these vast landscapes
*  and clear brush is just far beyond anything that we are capable of committing to
*  at this point in a place like the US or Canada and really anywhere in the world.
*  We may want to try cultivating different kinds of regrowth in areas
*  where trees have already burned, but the truth is we've proven pretty bad
*  at growing things like tree plantations to this point,
*  and so I don't know how much stock to put into that.
*  I think most fire scientists would tell you that the things that we've been doing over the last 20 or 30 years
*  are still the best options we have.
*  They're just coming with much higher side effects and secondary costs than we appreciate it at the time.
*  We probably want to be doing more controlled burns because
*  if you conduct a genuinely controlled burn, the fire burns at a lower heat,
*  it produces maybe in some cases slightly lower carbon emissions, certainly less smoke,
*  and you can prevent really out of control fires from occurring in the future.
*  But we're still going to be dealing with a landscape that is much, much more flammable,
*  and when those ignitions do come larger areas are going to burn,
*  they're going to burn more intensely, they're going to produce more smoke,
*  and they're going to produce a whole lot of carbon emissions.
*  So even doing a very aggressive, forest management approach doesn't leave us in a safe place
*  when it comes to forest fire, and the more that we know about these secondary costs,
*  the scarier that future may seem.
*  So basically pretty thin gruel in terms of options.
*  And as you said, it took decades to come up with our current strategies,
*  so all of this is really going to take time.
*  So what are we facing then?
*  What does our medium term actually look like?
*  Well, I think the short answer is that it's a future that has a lot more fire in it,
*  and we used to think about fire management in terms of protecting people,
*  and I think we're going to grow increasingly concerned about the risk from smoke
*  and from carbon emissions, but there isn't an easy answer to those things,
*  which means we're going to be living in a quite different relationship with nature
*  than we've developed over the past half century or several centuries,
*  depending on how you want to count.
*  You know, it used to be tempting for people like me, for people worried about the climate,
*  to think that, well, if the world really got together, we could get a handle on this problem.
*  If we really invested and focused on decarbonization, we could eliminate carbon emissions
*  and solve global warming, and if we really focused on adaptation measures,
*  we could protect people against what was coming as a result of the stuff
*  we'd already put into the atmosphere to this point.
*  But I think the lesson of the new age of wildfire is that we have much less control
*  over a lot of these forces than we'd like to tell ourselves.
*  So one lesson here when thinking about all of this is maybe we can't manage the natural world like we used to,
*  and especially fires, like we used to think we can control them or at least manage them,
*  and now they are controlling us. They have the upper hand.
*  And that is such a basic promise of the modern age of the last century
*  that if we chose to, we could control nature.
*  We were more powerful than it, and we could hold it at bay and minimize its threats over time.
*  Climate change is unfortunately undoing a lot of that,
*  making that promise and that expectation much more ragged.
*  And we may end up in a future of 50 years from now or 100 years from now,
*  where we've gotten a better sense of the lay of the land,
*  and can introduce new rules, new patterns, new approaches.
*  But for now, I think we're going to be living in a kind of a complicated, difficult,
*  uncertain ways, dangerous relationship with the natural world,
*  as it responds to the changes that we've made inevitable in it.
*  And so we're going to have to develop a whole new set of expectations
*  and a whole new set of approaches to allow us to live in a climate regime
*  we're just beginning to understand.
*  David, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  Former president Donald Trump pleaded not guilty on Thursday
*  to charges that he conspired to remain in office despite his 2020 election loss.
*  Trump appeared in a courthouse in Washington,
*  and stood before a federal magistrate judge who ordered him not to communicate
*  about the case with any witnesses,
*  and set the date for the case's first hearing in front of a trial judge for August 28th.
*  It was the third time in four months that Trump stood before a judge on criminal charges.
*  But it was the most momentous.
*  The beginning of what prosecutors say should be a reckoning for his many efforts
*  to undermine one of the core tenets of democracy.
