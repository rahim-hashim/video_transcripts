*  Hi, my name is Jonathan Moller and I'm a staff writer for the New York Times magazine.
*  This story that I wrote for the magazine, and you'll hear it in a minute, is about the
*  most dangerous person in the world.
*  That's at least according to Mike Pompeo, as he said in an interview last year.
*  Remember, Mike Pompeo formally led the CIA.
*  He was also Donald Trump's secretary of state, so it was surprising when he didn't say
*  this person was somebody like Vladimir Putin.
*  Rather, he said this name, Randy Winegarten.
*  Randy Winegarten is a five-foot tall 60-something who lives with her wife, a rabbi, in Manhattan.
*  I know.
*  It's likely you've never heard of her, but she's the president of one of the largest and
*  most influential teachers unions in the country, the American Federation of Teachers.
*  So why does Pompeo consider her this incredibly powerful and malevolent force?
*  What has happened in America that a high profile member of the last presidential administration
*  would single out this relatively obscure person as the most dangerous person in the world?
*  Criticism of public education has been pretty consistent over recent decades.
*  For one, our test scores as a nation are incredibly low, and so people say that public schools
*  aren't getting the job done, and perhaps that money would be better spent somewhere else,
*  like a charter school.
*  Then there's this moral criticism about the curriculum itself.
*  Some people don't approve of what public schools teach their children.
*  They would prefer to move them with the help of government vouchers into religious or
*  home schools.
*  In many ways, these debates can be traced back to Brown versus Board of Education and
*  the desegregation of the schools.
*  Some people feel like, you know what?
*  We don't want our children in the same schools as these other kids, whoever those other
*  kids may be.
*  Then COVID broke open the floodgates.
*  It provided this opportunity for long-time critics to go all out against the institution
*  of public education itself.
*  First came the incredibly charged fights over when to reopen the schools.
*  A lot of parents wanted their kids back in school, but a lot of teachers were worried about
*  COVID.
*  Some people argued that because the unions were reluctant to reopen, it was just further
*  proof that they were not to be trusted to educate their children.
*  That shifted into debates over the culture wars, over Black Lives Matter, and eventually
*  over trans issues.
*  And it took the political form of, by and large, Republican politicians running in the midterms
*  and in local school board races, campaigning against public education.
*  And so Randy Winegarten, who had used her own position to campaign on behalf of Democrats
*  and defend teachers, became a huge target for the right.
*  Suddenly, you had these radically different agendas colliding in a way that only the
*  pandemic could have made possible.
*  We saw it play out in Virginia's gubernatorial race with Glenn Youngkin, and more recently
*  in the mayoral race in Chicago with Brandon Johnson.
*  The fights over public education are only going to get more intense as next year's presidential
*  campaign ramps up.
*  This is a story about teachers unions.
*  It's a story about public education, and yes, Randy Winegarten is at the center of it.
*  But it's really about how politics and education have become more closely intertwined than at any
*  point in American history.
*  So here's this week's Sunday read.
*  The most dangerous person in the world is Randy Winegarten, read by Eduardo Ballerini.
*  When the former secretary of state and CIA director Mike Pompeo, a man who had dealt first
*  hand with autocrats like Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, described Randy Winegarten as
*  the most dangerous person in the world last November, it seemed as though he couldn't
*  possibly be serious.
*  Winegarten is 65 and just over five feet tall.
*  He is Jewish and openly gay.
*  She's married to a rabbi and lives in Upper Manhattan.
*  She is the longtime president of the American Federation of Teachers, which is not even the
*  country's biggest union of public school educators.
*  The AFT has 1.7 million members.
*  The National Education Association has 3 million.
*  The AFT did give an excess of $26 million to democratic candidates and causes in the
*  2022 election cycle, but the Carpenters and Joiners Union gave more than twice as much.
*  Pompeo, whose remarks appeared in a widely quoted interview with the online news site
*  SEME4, had nevertheless put his finger on something.
*  The pandemic and the ongoing culture wars of a race and gender had shifted America's
*  educational landscape, and with it the political landscape.
*  It's not a close call Pompeo elaborated.
*  If you ask, who's the most likely to take this republic down, it would be the teachers unions,
*  and the filth that they're teaching our kids, and the fact that they don't know math and
*  reading or writing.
*  Other republicans quickly piled on.
*  Pompeo had set the bar high, and they needed to invoke equally hot rhetoric and florid imagery
*  to ensure headlines of their own.
*  Big labor unions have taken over public education.
*  When entered Tim's god of South Carolina told Fox News in late January,
*  that's bad for parents, bad for kids, bad for America.
*  Senator Marco Rubio of Florida mounted his attack in the American Conservative magazine.
*  Our schools are a cesspool of Marxist indoctrination.
*  Dangerous academic constructs like critical race theory and radical gender theory are being
*  forced on elementary school children.
*  Governor Ron DeSantis would already garnered national attention with his book bans, Florida's
*  Stop, Woke Act, and its so-called Don't Say Gay legislation unveiled a new proposal
*  designed to rein in overreaching teachers unions, which a column on the Fox website enthusiastically
*  embraced as a blueprint to dominate union bosses.
*  Donald Trump, declaring that public schools have been taken over by the radical left maniacs
*  and pink-haired communists, released his own plan to save American education.
*  It was clear that Weingarten had come to stand for something much larger than herself.
*  The last few years have been historically convulsive ones for education in America.
*  Some 1.3 million children left the public schools during the pandemic.
*  The results from the most recent national assessment of educational progress, known as the nation's
*  report card, revealed the largest average score decline in reading since 1990, and the
*  first average score decline in math since 1969.
*  Schools have reported major increases in rates of student depression, anxiety, and trauma.
*  School districts around the country are experiencing severe teacher shortages.
*  Last fall, a Gallup poll found that the percentage of adults were satisfied with the nation's
*  public schools had fallen to 42 percent, a 20-year low.
*  This crisis has political consequences.
*  The pandemic, closures, and classroom culture wars have fueled the revival of the dormant
*  school choice movement, with Republican-led states around the country passing an array
*  of far-reaching school voucher bills.
*  These bills come in different forms, but share a common goal.
*  To enable parents to move their children out of America's government-run education system
*  on mass, all of the prospective Republican presidential candidates for 2024 have committed
*  to building on this growing movement whose roots can be traced back more than 50 years
*  to the battle over desegregation.
*  The same pandemic closures that demonstrated how central public schools are to the communities
*  they serve also became the inciting event for an unprecedented effort to dismantle them.
*  The public education system may not be very popular right now, but both Democrats and
*  Republicans tend to like their local schools and their children's teachers.
*  The unions that represent those teachers, however, are more polarizing.
*  One reason for this is that they are actively involved in partisan politics, and, more specifically,
*  are closely aligned with the Democrats, a reality powerfully driven home during the pandemic.
*  A study by Brown University's Annenberg Institute found the Democratic Districts, with correspondingly
*  strong teachers' unions, returned to in-person learning more slowly and gradually than
*  Republican Districts with weaker unions.
*  In some ways Randy Weingarten and the AFT, the Union Balls and Big Labor, are a logical,
*  even inevitable target for the GOP.
*  A frequent knock on the AFT is that it puts teachers before students, a framing neatly
*  encapsulated by a quoted tribute to the Union's former president, Al Shanker.
*  When school children start paying union dues, that's when I'll start representing the
*  interests of school children.
*  Shanker's biographer, Richard Callenberg, found no record of Shanker's ever saying this
*  and doesn't think he ever did, but that hasn't stopped the Union's critics from citing it.
*  Weingarten has a rebuttal.
*  Good working conditions for teachers make good learning conditions for students.
*  But Weingarten does in fact represent teachers, not students.
*  Often such as when it comes to issues like classroom size or school budgets, they're
*  interests align.
*  Sometimes they don't.
*  For a period during the pandemic, the two groups apparent interests diverged, and a series
*  of fault lines started opening across the country, separating not only Republicans from
*  Democrats, but also parents from teachers, centrist Democrats from Progressives and Urban
*  Black Parents from suburban white parents, and even dividing the teachers' union itself.
*  These fault lines widened as the reopening debates merged into fights over how schools
*  should deal with the teaching of the country's racial history, as well as sexuality and gender
*  identity.
*  What became increasingly clear to me over the last several months as I spoke to dozens
*  of politicians, political consultants, union leaders, parent activists, and education scholars
*  about the convulsions in American education is that it's no longer possible to separate
*  education from politics, and that public schools are more vulnerable than they've ever been.
*  How did Randy Weingarten wind up at the center of the 2024 Republican primary?
*  The only way to answer that question is to re-examine America's education wars and
*  the competing political agendas that are driving them.
*  Oh, goodness no, not at all!
*  Pompeo answered when I asked if he was, perhaps being hyperbolic in his remarks about Weingarten.
*  It's not just about Ms. Weingarten, but she has been the most visible face of the destruction
*  of American education.
*  In the chaotic early months of the pandemic, teachers were celebrated as essential workers,
*  heroically continuing to serve America's children from their homes, often with limited
*  resources and inadequate technology.
*  But during the summer of 2020, things started to shift.
*  There was already early research showing that students were suffering academically from
*  remote learning.
*  Schools across Europe had begun reopening without any major outbreaks, and many of America's
*  private and parochial schools were making plans to resume in-person learning at the start
*  of the new school year.
*  A lot of public school parents wanted their children to be back in the classroom too,
*  but many teachers seemed resistant to the idea.
*  Because of the decentralized structure of America's public education system, which has
*  some 14,000 different school districts, the federal government could not order schools
*  to reopen for in-person learning.
*  But in July 2020, President Trump threatened to withhold federal funds from those that
*  didn't.
*  His education secretary Betsy DeVos echoed his sentiments, demanding that the nation's
*  schools be fully operational by the fall without providing a specific plan for doing so.
*  Many members of the AFT remained worried about putting themselves, their families, and
*  their communities at risk.
*  The AFT had issued its own reopening plan in late April, calling for adequate personal
*  protective equipment, a temporary suspension of formal teacher performance evaluations,
*  a limit on student testing, a cancellation of student loan debt, and a $750 billion federal
*  aid package to help schools prepare to reopen safely and facilitate a real recovery for
*  all our communities.
*  Winegarten did not believe the Trump administration was giving schools what teachers needed to
*  return to work safely.
*  She publicly denounced Trump and DeVos's call to reopen as reckless, callous, and cruel.
*  And the AFT passed a resolution supporting local strikes if schools were forced to reopen
*  in areas where a variety of safety conditions hadn't been met.
*  As if to underscore the point, some teachers took to the streets and protest with mock
*  coffins.
*  Florida became a test case.
*  Even as the state's COVID death rate was surging in July, its Department of Education
*  issued an emergency order requiring schools to fully reopen in August.
*  The state's largest teachers union, the Florida Education Association, affiliated with both
*  the AFT and the NEA, sued DeSantis and his Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran, among
*  others, to block the re-opening, arguing that the order violated the state's constitution,
*  which guarantees Florida residents the right to safe and secure public schools.
*  At a virtual news conference announcing the lawsuit, Winegarten accused DeSantis of being
*  in intense denial.
*  After some Florida school started reopening, an AFT political action committee produced
*  a TV ad attacking Trump, citing claims that schools were becoming super-spreader sites,
*  and that children were being used as guinea pigs.
*  As the lawsuit was working its way through the legal system, the union won in the lower
*  court but lost on appeal.
*  Florida was holding its biannual school board elections, and the prospective return to
*  in-person learning became the defining issue in many races.
*  In Brevard County, Tina Deskovich, the incumbent, was in favor of an immediate return to the
*  classroom and opposed mask mandates.
*  She was challenged by a public school speech-language pathologist Jennifer Jenkins, who called for
*  a more cautious approach, including a mask mandate for all but the youngest children.
*  Jenkins easily won the late August election, but Deskovich was just getting started.
*  She called Tiffany Justice, a fellow school board member in nearby Indian River County,
*  to suggest that they create their own parents' rights group, Mom's For Liberty.
*  We've got to do something here, Justice Recall Deskovich's telling her,
*  we have to help these parents because they're trying to step up and speak out,
*  and the schools are just slamming them at every turn.
*  Other parents across the political spectrum started organizing too.
*  Many public schools hadn't fully reopened for the start of the new school year, and they were frustrated.
*  They wrote op-ets, held rallies, or met via Zoom with school board members, and other elected
*  officials, often finding themselves at odds with local teachers' unions and union-backed
*  school board members.
*  The first fault lines had started to open.
*  By the fall of 2020, the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer and the
*  rise of the Black Lives Matter movement had prompted a national reckoning over race,
*  as well as an ensuing backlash.
*  The politics of the pandemic had begun to merge with the culture wars, and both were playing
*  out most vividly in the American classroom.
*  An esoteric academic term, critical race theory, or CRT, had improbably become the rallying
*  cry for a conservative campaign focused on the teaching of the nation's racial history.
*  President Trump, running for re-election, eagerly took up the cause, blaming decades of left-wing
*  indoctrination in our schools for the Black Lives Matter protest, and urging America's
*  parents to fight back against efforts to teach their children hateful lies about this
*  country.
*  The AFT championed the new movement for racial equity, committing publicly to the fight
*  to end systemic racism in America.
*  Some of the AFT's locals went further.
*  The Chicago Teachers' Union took to the streets to demand that the city's board of education
*  cancel a $33 million contract between Chicago's public schools and its police department
*  for the safety officers who staff the city's public schools.
*  United Teachers' Los Angeles helped lead a successful fight to press its school district
*  to slash its police budget by $25 million, and used the money instead to hire more counselors,
*  psychologists, and social workers.
*  That October, Wengarton embarked on a cross-country bus tour to get out the vote for Joe Biden.
*  His Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, had not always been in sync with the AFT.
*  The Union opposed elements of Obama's race to the top program, which sent money to states
*  that reformed their public education systems by, among other things, weakening teacher tenure,
*  introducing data-driven accountability measures and adding more non-unionized charter schools.
*  Biden, by contrast, vowed to focus on neighborhood public schools rather than charters, and criticized
*  the standardized testing regimes and teacher evaluations that were a hallmark of race to
*  the top.
*  Wengarton's name was even floated as a candidate for Secretary of Education.
*  She didn't get the job, but she in the head of the NEA, Becky Pringle, were invited to
*  the White House on the day after Biden's inauguration.
*  The Teachers' Union finally had a true ally in the Oval Office.
*  The first lady, Jill Biden, taught at a public community college herself.
*  I sleep with an NEA member every night, President Biden would later quip.
*  The new administration gave Teachers' preferential access to the COVID vaccine, behind some other
*  essential workers, but ahead of the general population.
*  Biden had pledged to quickly reopen America schools, and the AFT was communicating with
*  top officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about its guidelines for
*  doing so, suggesting that the agency had a provision allowing for its recommendations
*  to be revisited if a highly contagious COVID variant emerged.
*  But the anger that had been unleashed by the pandemic closures and the culture wars
*  had not abated.
*  Justice and Deskovich, the former Florida School Board members, incorporated moms for Liberty
*  in early 2021 with a far more ambitious and political agenda than simply advocating
*  a return to maskless in-person classes.
*  As the group's mission statement explained, it was dedicated to fighting for the survival
*  of America by unifying, educating, and empowering parents to defend their parental rights at
*  all levels of government.
*  The group built its brand with bumper magnets and t-shirts emblazoned with the motto,
*  we do not co-parent with the government.
*  It was embraced by the right-wing media, and then by donors eager to turn it into a national
*  movement, while nurturing its grassroots image, mirroring the model created by the Tea Party,
*  a quasi-populist uprising fueled by conservative billionaires and Fox News.
*  The former Fox host Megan Kelly, headlined a fundraising event in Florida, speaking
*  about, as Justice recalled, the woke ideology coming out of America's classrooms.
*  Moms for Liberty soon expanded beyond Florida.
*  That summer, a chapter in Tennessee presented an 11-page letter of complaint to the State's
*  Department of Education.
*  According to a curriculum that it said, focus is repeatedly and daily on very dark and
*  divisive slivers of American history.
*  It works to, so feelings of resentment, shame of one's skin color, and or fear.
*  After several Republican states' past laws limiting the teaching of race-related subjects
*  and banning CRT, Wengarten gave a speech citing a historian who had compared their efforts
*  to the censorship of the Soviet regime.
*  A clip of the speech spent days in heavy rotation on Fox News, and it inspired an editorial
*  in the Wall Street Journal.
*  The Teachers' Unions Go Woke.
*  It was not Glenn Youngkin's plan to turn Virginia's 2021 governor's race into a referendum
*  on America's battles of education.
*  Initially, he was just hoping to prevent his opponent, Terry McColliffe, from owning an
*  issue that historically favored Democrats.
*  He couldn't afford to let them take the fight to us, Jeff Roe, one of Youngkin's chief
*  strategists told me.
*  By almost every measure, Youngkin, a former private equity executive with no political experience,
*  was the underdog.
*  McColliffe, a Democratic stalwart dating back to the Clinton presidency, served as Virginia's
*  governor between 2014 and 2018.
*  A state law-abarring governor's from serving consecutive terms prevented him from running
*  for re-election.
*  Biden had beaten Trump by 10 points in Virginia, and McColliffe led in the early polls.
*  But Virginia's schools had been among the last on the East Coast to fully reopen, and
*  the lingering bitterness from these pandemic closures had formed a politically combustible
*  mix with the rising culture wars.
*  Amid the national racial reckoning of 2020, Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and
*  Technology in Fairfax County, one of the top public high schools in the nation, had
*  jettisoned its admissions exam, prompting a lawsuit by 17 families, many of them, Asian
*  American, who viewed the change as a form of discrimination against their children.
*  Some of the most bitter fights were unfolding in suburban Loudon County, where a proposal
*  to allow transgender children to choose which bathrooms and pronouns they wish to use
*  had sparked an angry backlash among conservative parents.
*  The tensions were later exacerbated by news of a sexual assault in a high school girl's
*  bathroom perpetrated by a boy who was wearing a skirt at the time.
*  Loudon's increasingly contentious school board meetings became spectator events, attracting
*  the sustained attention of right-wing media outlets like Fox News and The New York Post.
*  Young can help save our schools rallies and pledge to ban CRT from the state schools.
*  But his campaign's internal education polls revealed a wide range of voter priorities
*  across the state.
*  The race and gender issues that resonated with his base, Trump voters, weren't going
*  to be enough to win.
*  He microtargeted other education voters with different ads.
*  It was a scattershot approach, though, at least until a gubernatorial debate in late
*  September.
*  During his tenure as governor, McCollough had vetoed a bill, prompted by a mother who objected
*  to her high school senior son's reading Tony Morrison's beloved in an AP English class,
*  but would have enabled parents to prevent their children from studying material they
*  deemed sexually explicit.
*  When Young can criticize that decision on the debate stage, McCollough shot back.
*  I don't think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.
*  Recognizing that they had just been handed a political gift, Young can staff cobbled
*  together a digital and TV ad that very night, hoping to take advantage of the apparent
*  gaff before McCollough tried to clarify it.
*  I was sure he was going to walk it back on Morning Joe," wrote told me.
*  Instead, McCollough stood by his comment, saying that states and local school boards should
*  have authority over what's taught in schools.
*  Young can unify his diffuse education campaign under a new phrase, Parents Matter, printing
*  up t-shirts and bumper stickers and holding Parents Matter rallies in suburban and ex-urban
*  counties that supported Biden in 2020.
*  McCollough's quote became the centerpiece of a rolling series of ads accusing him of
*  going on the attack against parents.
*  A longtime critic of organized labor Young can also sought to drive a wedge between teachers
*  and their unions, promising to devote at least $100 million to raise teacher salaries while
*  at the same time saying that McCollough would bout with special interest allies rather
*  than doing what's best for children.
*  A vast majority of Virginia's teachers belonged to the NEA, which tends to cover more rural
*  areas, not the AFT whose members are generally concentrated in big cities.
*  But Weingarten was friendly with McCollough from the Clinton days and was supporting his
*  candidacy on Twitter and cable news, and the AFT was helping him develop his education
*  platform.
*  Weingarten told me that she called McCollough after the debate to tell him that he was wrong,
*  that parents should have a role in their children's education.
*  Weingarten made a very bad mistake, which Young can capitalize on, she said.
*  Through a spokesman McCollough said that he talked to Weingarten regularly during the campaign
*  but has no recollection of her criticizing his remark.
*  By the fall of 2021, America's public schools were fully open, but mask mandates were still
*  being hotly contested.
*  Weingarten had been working to try to rebuild trust between some families and their schools.
*  In late September, just a couple of days after the McCollough debate, she held a virtual town
*  hall on mask mandates with open schools USA, an anti-masking right-wing parents' rights
*  group that was rallying families to pull their children out of public schools, in an effort
*  to foster open dialogue with the Union's critics.
*  Under Weingarten, who is elected president of the AFT in 2008, the National Union has gone
*  all in on electoral politics, significantly increasing its political spending in the
*  belief that the best way to serve its rank and file is by electing Democrats.
*  The AFT gave more than $1 million to McCollough, and Weingarten even knocked on doors for him
*  in Alexandria.
*  But Youngkin had the momentum in the final weeks of the race.
*  As candidacy received another boost in October, when Attorney General Merrick Garland ordered
*  the FBI to help address the rising threats of violence towards some school board members.
*  The order stemmed from a letter written to the Biden administration by the National School
*  Board's Association, asking that federal law enforcement address threats against public
*  school officials that could be the equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism.
*  But Republican lawmakers and the right-wing media seized on the language in the letter
*  to falsely accuse Garland of labeling parents domestic terrorists.
*  Youngkin quickly exploited the opportunity, releasing an ad claiming that the FBI was trying
*  to silence parents.
*  On the night before the election, Weingarten headed down to Virginia to warm up the crowd
*  at McCollough's closing rally in Fairfax County.
*  She was eager to be on hand for the final push, and her staff asked for her to be given
*  a speaking role at the rally.
*  Because she had been such a generous and loyal supporter of McCollough's, the campaign didn't
*  want to say no, even though some Democrats worried that they could be handing Youngkin another
*  gift.
*  Politically speaking, Weingarten played perfectly into Youngkin's parents' matter campaign.
*  That spring a right-wing watchdog group Americans for Public Trust had gotten hold of
*  email communications between top officials at the AFT and the CDC about the agency's
*  school reopening guidelines through the Freedom of Information Act and had passed them
*  on to the New York Post.
*  The tabloid which had been gleefully attacking Weingarten for years, dubbing her wine-wh-i-n-e-garten,
*  trumpet at the story.
*  Powerful Teachers Union-influenced CDC on school reopening's documents show.
*  The rest of the right-wing media and numerous Republican officials instantly jumped on the
*  narrative.
*  Senator Susan Collins of Maine grilled the CDC's director Dr. Rochelle Wollensky, had a committee
*  hearing over what she called the CDC's secret negotiations with the Teachers Union.
*  Weingarten told me that the CDC had solicited the AFT's input, and that the union hadn't
*  suggested anything that the agency wasn't already considering incorporating into its
*  guidelines.
*  But the appearance of a partisan union leader who had privately discussed the future of the
*  nation's schools with a government agency could be counterproductive in Virginia's charged
*  political climate.
*  Youngest staff was giddy at the prospect.
*  I wanted to send them a gift basket.
*  Kristen Davison, another senior young constratigist, told me.
*  It was almost as good as when Stacey Abrams came.
*  The Republican elected officials around the country took pot shots at their emerging villain.
*  The union boss responsible for shutting down schools is the final surrogate for Terry
*  McCollough's failing campaign.
*  Senator Tom Cotten of Arkansas wrote on Twitter, for unions should vote accordingly.
*  Young can one, narrowly, motivating the GOP base and making critical inroads in loudness,
*  but should vote it overwhelmingly for Biden.
*  For a closer, for a campaign, he would think he would bring in a showstopper.
*  Betsy DeVosk loaded on Fox News on election night.
*  I guess in this case, he did bring in a showstopper and Randy Winegarten because she definitely
*  stopped the show for kids across the country.
*  To Republicans, Winegarten may be too progressive, but to some members of her own union, she is
*  not progressive enough.
*  As the pandemic dragged on, she found herself caught between the wishes of the Democratic
*  establishment she did not want to alienate and the left-leaning rank and file she represented.
*  In Chicago, this tension came down in early 2022 to the most elemental question for unions.
*  Whether or not to strike.
*  At the time, the new Omicron variant was surging, and Illinois was experiencing a record number
*  of COVID cases and hospitalizations.
*  The AFT's left-wing local, the Chicago Teachers Union, was concerned about sending its 25,000
*  members back to the classroom after winter break.
*  The union was hearing similar worries from the Black families whose children make up a
*  large percentage of the 320,000 students in Chicago's public schools.
*  Many whites suburban and ex-urban parents had been desperate to see their children return
*  to the classroom and were now committed to keeping them there.
*  But many urban black parents, who tended to live in smaller homes with more family members,
*  had generally lower vaccination rates, and had lost more loved ones to the pandemic, had
*  been and remained wary, especially with the new variant spiking.
*  The union demanded mandatory testing for all teachers and students, or a temporary return
*  to remote learning.
*  Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a Democrat, balked.
*  President Biden and other prominent Democrats had been unambiguous about their desire for
*  the nation's schools to remain open.
*  And the recent governor's election in Virginia had underscored the political danger of introducing
*  more disruptions to in-person learning, especially with the 2022 midterms just around
*  the corner.
*  For Wengarten and the National Union, a strike in the country's third largest school system
*  would obviously be politically costly.
*  The insertion group that leads the CTEU first came together in 2008, when the bipartisan
*  education reform movement was sweeping across the country, dividing the Democratic Party.
*  Centrist billionaires and centrist Democrats joined forces to lead the effort to introduce
*  more testing, accountability, and free market competition to the public schools.
*  But the more progressive wing of the party viewed these measures as an attack on the very
*  institution of public education, unleashing the forces of capitalism on what is supposed
*  to be a public good.
*  In Chicago, the reform efforts were led by Arnie Duncan, the chief executive of the city's
*  public school district and President Obama's future education secretary.
*  Neo Liberal Education reform hit Chicago like a ton of bricks.
*  Jesse Sharkey, a high school history teacher, told me.
*  Sharkey was a leader of this insurgency and would go on to become president of the CTEU
*  from 2018 to 2022.
*  He'd flip on the TV or pick up a newspaper, and he couldn't avoid hearing our so-called
*  leaders trashing our schools, talking about their culture of failure, he says.
*  It was an environment that was downright hostile to public education.
*  Sharkey and his fellow insurgents didn't believe the National Union was fighting aggressively
*  enough against these democratic reformers.
*  Tapping into Chicago's long history of community-based organizing, they built their own grassroots
*  movement within the Union, called the Caucus of Rank and File Educators, or Core.
*  Led by Karen Lewis, a chemistry teacher and union activist, Core challenged the CTEU
*  using incumbent leadership in 2010 and one control of the Chicago Union.
*  Two years later, after the city's new Democratic mayor, President Obama's former chief of
*  staff from a manual, embarked on an ambitious program to close public schools and replace
*  them with charters, the CTEU called Chicago's first teacher strike in 25 years.
*  While the CTEU was voting on the strike authorization, Winegarten arrived in Chicago to appear on
*  a panel with a manual at a conference hosted by the Clinton Global Initiative.
*  It was a stunning turn of events that spoke to the tension between the AFT and its left
*  wing.
*  For the political health of the Union, Winegarten felt she needed to preserve her relationship
*  with the country's most powerful democratic leaders, many of whom, like Emmanuel, were
*  centrist reformers.
*  As the 2012 strike war on, Emmanuel tried to turn the city against the teachers, accusing
*  them of using Chicago's children as pawns, and unsuccessfully sought a court order to force
*  them to return to work.
*  After seven days, the city backed down.
*  The Union won major concessions, including a 16 percent raise over four years, and
*  the right for teachers who were laid off as part of the manual's ongoing school closures
*  to be given priority for positions at other schools.
*  The strike instantly became a galvanizing event for the Union's more progressive members.
*  Not only does CORE still control the CTEU, but like-minded left-wing slates have since
*  taken control of AFT locals in several other cities too, including Los Angeles and Baltimore.
*  These insurgent caucuses are unified by what they call social justice unionism.
*  They see public schools ongoing struggles to educate their students as inseparable from
*  the larger societal and economic issues facing their working class members and the poor communities
*  whose children dominate their classrooms.
*  We are trying to promote a brand of unionism that goes all out in its fight for educational
*  justice, and is brave about taking on conflicts, Sharky says.
*  In some ways we're less careful about who we piss off nationally.
*  There is a natural tension between these insurgent movements and the more establishment-oriented
*  national union.
*  In 2015, some rank and file members protested the AFT's decision to issue an early endorsement
*  of Hillary Clinton, to whom one garden is close was running against the pro-labor Bernie
*  Sanders.
*  But the tension is about more than just politics.
*  It also goes to the heart of the AFT's identity.
*  To these caucuses, the union's power comes from the collective strength of its members,
*  from the bottom up, which can conflict with the top-down leadership style of wine garden.
*  Who is cultivated a distinct public profile, sometimes characterized by her own tendency
*  toward political hyperbole.
*  An impulsive user of Twitter, she has been known to send out the occasional overheated
*  message.
*  During the pandemic, when dissentists supporters were selling, don't fow-che my Florida merchandise,
*  including beer cuisies, on the GOP's win-read website, she wrote,
*  Disgusting.
*  Millions of Floridians are going to die from ronde-decentices ignorance.
*  She later apologized for the tweet.
*  Two days after returning from winter break in January 2022, with their demands still
*  unmet, the C.T.U. called a strike.
*  The union isn't stupid.
*  Sharky, who is president at the time, told me, we knew people were sick of the pandemic.
*  But he went on, for better or for worse, were a union that strikes.
*  We didn't think it would be an easy or strategically wise thing, but there was a principle around
*  it.
*  It was something we had to do.
*  The union already had a contentious relationship with Lightfoot, dating back to an 11-day strike
*  over wages and class sizes in 2019 that ended with the city making major concessions.
*  This time, though, the mayor had public opinion on her side, and she leveraged it in a flurry
*  of media interviews, accusing the C.T.U. of holding Chicago's children hostage.
*  Lightfoot had long seen the AFT's local as a political movement whose ambitions extended
*  well beyond protecting the rights of its workers.
*  I think, ultimately, they'd like to take over not only Chicago public schools, but take
*  over running the city government.
*  She told the Times in 2021.
*  The 2022 strike quickly became a political nightmare for national Democrats.
*  A Democratic mayor was at war with a Democratic union, shutting down Chicago's schools at
*  a moment when children were finally back in the classroom, and the country was just beginning
*  to confront the learning loss and emotional trauma caused by the pandemic.
*  Splinter groups of teachers in Northern California were also planning sick-outs in the face
*  of the Omicron Surge.
*  The Chicago strike put Wengarden in a difficult position.
*  Publicly, she supported the C.T.U. while also saying that children needed to be in the
*  classroom.
*  Behind the scenes she was calling and texting Sharkey constantly, offering to do anything
*  she could, even arrange a call with people at the White House to help press Lightfoot
*  and end the strike.
*  After a few days, under intensifying public pressure, the C.T.U. members voted to return
*  to work.
*  They had lost this battle, but they already had their sights on a bigger one.
*  The city's upcoming mayoral election.
*  In late October, just before the 2022 midterms, the results from the first full national assessment
*  of educational progress since the start of the pandemic were released, revealing that
*  40% of the country's eighth grade public school students were not proficient in math, and
*  32% were not proficient in reading.
*  The strikingly low scores instantly became a GOP talking point.
*  The culprit wasn't the pandemic, schools, or teachers, but the unions, and democratic
*  politicians beholden to them.
*  We cannot let the nation forget how teachers unions tried to hold our children's futures
*  for ransom, said representative Virginia Fox of North Carolina, then the ranking Republican
*  on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
*  These union bosses and the politicians who enabled them must be held accountable.
*  Republicans up and down the ballot accused their democratic opponents of carrying water
*  for the teachers unions.
*  A week before the election, Fox News ran a segment headlined, have the teachers unions
*  sold out your kids to the Democrats.
*  Christopher Rufo, the right-wing activist who manufactured the obsession with CRT two
*  years earlier, was now on Fox News railing against another crisis.
*  The academic queer theory that he charged was being mainlined into America's public schools,
*  while Republican candidates condemned the grooming of children to identify as different
*  genders in the nation's classrooms.
*  Many Republican candidates pledged their allegiance to a parents' bill of rights, requiring
*  schools to provide information on reading lists, curriculums, and whether a family's
*  child used another name or pronoun in school.
*  The AFT spent an excess of $20 million in the 2022 midterms, more than it ever had in
*  an off-your-election, and Winegarden campaigned tirelessly with high-profile Democrats around
*  the country.
*  Her arrival on the stump invariably inspiring glee among local Republican leaders.
*  When she appeared in Michigan with Governor Gretchen Whitmer, one GOP-pundit, Kayleigh
*  McGee White, described her on Fox Business Network as the kiss of death.
*  Whitmer won easily, as did many other Democrats whose opponents had railed against drag queen
*  shows for children or LGBTQ-themed books and school libraries.
*  But Republican candidates who campaigned on another education issue, school choice,
*  fared much better.
*  As a political matter, all the education battles that had erupted since the start of the pandemic
*  over school closures, over how the country's racial history should be taught, over what
*  sort of role parents sought to have in the classroom, were really about the same thing.
*  Other America's children should continue to be educated in government-run public schools.
*  Did the pandemic and the culture wars reveal the indispensability of these schools to their
*  communities and to the broader fabric of the nation?
*  Or did they only underscore their inherent limitations, in effect, making the case for
*  school choice?
*  It was the University of Chicago economist Milton Friedman, who first proposed the modern
*  concept of school vouchers in a paper in 1955.
*  One was a champion of free markets, and his idea was to leverage the transformative
*  power of capitalism to prod schools to compete for family's dollars.
*  But vouchers served another purpose, too.
*  The Supreme Court had just ruled on Brown V-Board of Education, and many white Americans
*  were worried about the looming prospect of being forced to send their children to desegregated
*  schools.
*  Friedman's on opening for his proposal, writing, under such a system, there can develop
*  exclusively white schools, exclusively colored schools, and mixed schools.
*  Thirty years later, with Friedman serving as an economic advisor, President Reagan tried
*  repeatedly to introduce federal school voucher legislation.
*  One of his most vocal opponents was Al Shanker, then the AFT's president, who argued that
*  choice might be the point of shopping malls, but it was not the point of education.
*  Nor was it the reason taxpayers were expected to fund the nation's public schools.
*  We do so not to satisfy the individual wants of parents and students, but because of the
*  public interest in producing an educated citizenry capable of exercising the rights of liberty
*  and being productive members of society.
*  Even Congress, where Republicans held the Senate majority, considered Reagan's voucher
*  proposals too radical.
*  But the concept endured.
*  In the 1990s, vouchers were championed by Christian conservatives like Paul Wyric, a founder
*  of the Heritage Foundation and mentor to Justice Clarence Thomas.
*  Wyric believed that the nation's public schools had become morally decadent institutions,
*  and argued that the only answer was for Christians to educate their children themselves, ideally
*  with government money.
*  Over the years, some states experimented with limited voucher programs, typically designed
*  to target discrete populations like children with special needs.
*  But the pandemic created an opening for voucher advocates to think more ambitiously, and
*  move more aggressively.
*  In fact, this had been the plan almost from the very beginning.
*  Two months into the school closures in the spring of 2020, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the Catholic
*  Archbishop of New York, asked Devalls, then the Education Secretary and a long time supporter
*  of school choice in an interview on Sirius XM Radio, if she intended to utilize this
*  particular crisis to ensure that justice is finally done to our kids and the parents
*  who choose to send them to faith-based schools.
*  Devalls answered unequivocally.
*  Yes, absolutely.
*  In 2021, at least 18 states created new school choice programs or expanded existing ones,
*  and more followed suit in 2022.
*  Some of these new programs represent a significant departure from those of the past.
*  Known collectively as Universal Voucher programs, they are available to everyone, and can be
*  applied toward any kind of school.
*  The goal is not merely to disrupt public education, but to defund and dismantle it.
*  For years, the country's lower courts largely agreed that spending taxpayer money on religious
*  schools was unconstitutional.
*  But last summer, the Supreme Court created a new precedent, ruling that it was, in fact,
*  unconstitutional for voucher programs, in this case, one in rural Maine, to exclude religious
*  schools.
*  Devalls, now back in the private sector, is one of the leading funders of this new national
*  voucher campaign, primarily through an organization that she helped found called the American
*  Federation for Children.
*  The group in its affiliates spent $9 million on school choice campaigns in 2022, at least
*  $2.5 million of which came directly from Devalls and her husband.
*  They spent much of this money in the primaries, turning support for school choice into a litmus
*  test, and targeting Republican incumbents opposed to it.
*  Three-quarters of the candidates they supported, one.
*  There wasn't a red wave or a blue wave in the midterms, but there was a school choice
*  wave.
*  Corey D'Angeles, a senior fellow at the American Federation for Children, wrote to me
*  in an email.
*  Echoing wire excentiments about the moral decadence of American public education, D'Angeles
*  quoted Vody Balkum, a Christian home schooling advocate.
*  We cannot continue to send our children to Caesar for their education and be surprised
*  when they come home as Romans.
*  This identified wine-garten as a useful political foil long before Mike Pompeo.
*  He has been trolling her riddellent with the untwitter since 2021, ostentatiously thanking
*  her for starting the school choice revolution.
*  In March at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in suburban Washington, he
*  posed with a life-size cardboard cut out of her clutching an award labeled Threat
*  to America's Children, his left thumb raised an approval.
*  Very lightfoot, the Mayor of Chicago, was right about the local teacher's union's political
*  ambitions.
*  In February, Brandon Johnson, a former middle school teacher and paid union organizer, challenged
*  her in the city's mayoral election.
*  It was a long shot.
*  One early poll put his support at 3 percent.
*  But for the C.T.U., the Johnson campaign was a natural progression.
*  To pursue their broader agenda, which reaches beyond education into areas like housing and
*  policing, they needed the kind of power that can come only from winning partisan political
*  elections.
*  And they had both a powerful grassroots movement and a source of campaign funds in the form
*  of members' dues that could be leveraged to support Johnson's candidacy.
*  Johnson's campaign was underwritten largely by the teacher's unions.
*  Though the A.F.T and the C.T.U. had their differences in the past, they have become
*  more closely aligned in recent years.
*  While there are still some divisions within the Democratic Party over education policy,
*  the bipartisan education reform movement that once posed such a formidable existential
*  threat to the A.F.T. is a shadow of its former self.
*  The threat to the A.F.T. is now partisan, which means that Winegarten is no longer facing
*  as much pressure from centrist Democrats.
*  Backed by the financial and organizational muscle of the National and Local Teachers'
*  unions, Johnson knocked Lightfoot out of the two-person runoff, making her the first
*  incumbent mayor in Chicago to be unceded after a single term in 40 years.
*  By now Pompeo, Tim Scott, Marco Rubio, Rhonda Santas, Donald Trump, and the rest of the
*  Republican Party were busy elevating education to a central plank in its 2024 platform,
*  and in the process transforming Winegarten into the new Hillary.
*  A GOP stand in for everything that was wrong with America.
*  The Republican-led House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic was continuing
*  to build its case that Winegarten and the A.F.T. exerted undue influence over the CDC's
*  school reopening guidelines, summoning Winegarten to appear in Washington on April 26th at a hearing
*  titled, The Consequences of School Closures.
*  But Winegarten was building her own case.
*  Public education was now itself a hyperpartisan issue, and she addressed it in hyperpartisan
*  terms in a fiery speech at the National Press Club.
*  Calling out by name some of the people who had demonized her since the pandemic, including
*  Betsy DeVos, she described the ongoing effort to defund public schools as nothing less than
*  a threat to cornerstones of community, of our democracy, our economy, and our nation.
*  She pointed to studies that have shown that vouchers don't improve student achievement,
*  characterizing them as a backdoor, into private and parochial schools that are not subject
*  to the same federal civil rights laws as public institutions and can therefore promote discrimination.
*  Our public schools shouldn't be pawns for politicians' ambitions, she thundered, moving
*  toward her emotional conclusion.
*  They shouldn't be defunded or destroyed by ideologues.
*  Like the Virginia's governor's race one and a half years earlier, Chicago's mayoral
*  runoff became, at least in part, a referendum on education.
*  The effects of the pandemic on Chicago's public schools have been profound.
*  More than 33,000 students have left the school system since the fall of 2020, and the recent
*  national assessment of educational progress scores showed steep declines in math and a widening
*  achievement gap between white and black students.
*  Brandon Johnson's opponent, Paul Vallis, ran Chicago's public schools in the late 1990s.
*  Chicago has no Republican party to speak of, but Vallis, a vocal proponent of charter schools
*  and vouchers, was the conservative candidate.
*  In 2009, he said he was more of a Republican than a Democrat.
*  He was supported by the local business community and endorsed by the city's police union.
*  A group affiliated with the American Federation for Children spent $60,285 on a pro-Vallis
*  digital media effort, but Arnie Duncan and a number of other centrist Democrats endorsed
*  Vallis too.
*  On the eve of the April runoff election, Weingarten headed to Chicago to speak at a Johnson
*  political rally headlined by Bernie Sanders.
*  Both the AFT and the CTU continued to funnel money into Johnson's campaign as the election
*  approached.
*  Their combined contributions totaling $4.6 million.
*  All of this stuff is about power, observed a local community activist, Jamal Green, who
*  had run in the first round of the election, but didn't make the runoff and was now supporting
*  Vallis.
*  When Johnson narrowly won, it was a stunning upset, not just for the candidate, but for
*  the left.
*  Even as the Republicans were ramping up their attacks on Weingarten and on the institution
*  of public education, the teacher's unions had effectively elected the mayor of America's
*  third largest city, who was himself an avowedly progressive union organizer promising to raise
*  taxes on the rich, reform the police, and increase funding for the city's schools.
*  Maybe Pompeo hadn't been wrong, at least as far as his own party was concerned.
*  It was those who'd underestimated the political power of the unions, who were mistaken.
*  They said this would never happen.
*  Johnson said in his victory speech, if they didn't know, now they know.
