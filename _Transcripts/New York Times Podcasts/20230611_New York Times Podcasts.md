# The Sunday Read: ‘The Most Dangerous Person in the World Is Randi Weingarten’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEFEJTLCBc4)
*  Hi, my name is Jonathan Mahler, and I'm a staff writer for the New York Times magazine.
*  This story that I wrote for the magazine, and you'll hear it in a minute, is about
*  the most dangerous person in the world.
*  That's at least according to Mike Pompeo, as he said in an interview last year.
*  Remember, Mike Pompeo formerly led the CIA.
*  He was also Donald Trump's secretary of state.
*  So it was surprising when he didn't say this person was somebody like Vladimir Putin.
*  Rather, he said this name.
*  Randy Weingarten.
*  Randy Weingarten is a five-foot-tall, sixty-something, who lives with her wife, a rabbi, in Manhattan.
*  I know, it's likely you've never heard of her, but she's the president of one of the
*  largest and most influential teachers' unions in the country.
*  The American Federation of Teachers.
*  So why does Pompeo consider her this incredibly powerful and malevolent force?
*  What has happened in America that a high-profile member of the last presidential administration
*  this relatively obscure person as the most dangerous person in the world?
*  Criticism of public education has been pretty consistent over recent decades.
*  For one, our test scores as a nation are incredibly low, and so people say that public schools
*  aren't getting the job done, and perhaps that money would be better spent somewhere
*  else, like a charter school.
*  Then there's this moral criticism about the curriculum itself.
*  Some people don't approve of what public schools teach their children.
*  They would prefer to move them, with the help of government vouchers, into religious or
*  home schools.
*  In many ways, these debates can be traced back to Brown v. Board of Education and the
*  desegregation of the schools.
*  Some people feel like, you know what, we don't want our children in the same schools as these
*  other kids, whoever those other kids may be.
*  Then COVID broke open the floodgates.
*  It provided this opportunity for longtime critics to go all out against the institution
*  of public education itself.
*  First came the incredibly charged fights over when to reopen the schools.
*  A lot of parents wanted their kids back in school, but a lot of teachers were worried
*  about COVID.
*  Some people argued that because the unions were reluctant to reopen, it was just further
*  proof that they were not to be trusted to educate their children.
*  That shifted into debates over the culture wars, over Black Lives Matter, and eventually
*  over trans issues.
*  And it took the political form of, by and large, Republican politicians running in the
*  midterms and in local school board races, campaigning against public education.
*  And so Randi Weingarten, who had used her own position to campaign on behalf of Democrats
*  and defend teachers, became a huge target for the right.
*  Suddenly you had these radically different agendas colliding in a way that only the pandemic
*  could have made possible.
*  We saw it play out in Virginia's gubernatorial race with Glenn Youngkin, and more recently
*  in the mayoral race in Chicago with Brandon Johnson.
*  The fights over public education are only going to get more intense as next year's presidential
*  campaign ramps up.
*  This is a story about teachers unions.
*  It's a story about public education.
*  And yes, Randi Weingarten is at the center of it.
*  But it's really about how politics and education have become more closely intertwined than
*  at any point in American history.
*  So here's this week's Sunday Read.
*  The most dangerous person in the world is Randi Weingarten.
*  Read by Eduardo Ballerini.
*  When the former secretary of state and CIA director Mike Pompeo, a man who had dealt
*  firsthand with autocrats like Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, described Randi Weingarten
*  as the most dangerous person in the world last November, it seemed as though he couldn't
*  possibly be serious.
*  Weingarten is 65 and just over five feet tall.
*  She is Jewish and openly gay.
*  She's married to a rabbi and lives in Upper Manhattan.
*  She is the longtime president of the American Federation of Teachers, which is not even
*  the country's biggest union of public school educators.
*  The AFT has 1.7 million members.
*  The National Education Association has 3 million.
*  The AFT did give in excess of $26 million to Democratic candidates and causes in the
*  cycle.
*  But the Carpenters and Joiners Union gave more than twice as much.
*  Pompeo, whose remarks appeared in a widely quoted interview with the online news site
*  Semaphore, had nevertheless put his finger on something.
*  The pandemic and the ongoing culture wars over race and gender had shifted America's
*  educational landscape and with it, the political landscape.
*  It's not a close call, Pompeo elaborated.
*  If you ask, who's the most likely to take this republic down, it would be the teachers'
*  unions and the filth that they're teaching our kids and the fact that they don't know
*  math and reading or writing.
*  Other Republicans quickly piled on.
*  Pompeo had set the bar high and they needed to invoke equally hot rhetoric and florid
*  imagery to ensure headlines of their own.
*  Big labor unions have taken over public education, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina told Fox
*  News in late January.
*  That's bad for parents, bad for kids, bad for America.
*  Senator Marco Rubio of Florida mounted his attack in the American Conservative magazine.
*  Our schools are a cesspool of Marxist indoctrination.
*  Dangerous academic constructs like critical race theory and radical gender theory are
*  being forced on elementary school children.
*  Governor Ron DeSantis, who had already garnered national attention with his book bans, Florida's
*  Stop Woke Act and its so-called Don't Say Gay legislation, unveiled a new proposal designed
*  to rein in overreaching teachers' unions, which a column on the Fox website enthusiastically
*  embraced as a blueprint to dominate union bosses.
*  Donald Trump, declaring that public schools have been taken over by the radical left maniacs
*  and pink-haired communists, released his own plan to save American education.
*  It was clear that Weingarten had come to stand for something much larger than herself.
*  The last few years have been historically convulsive ones for education in America.
*  Some 1.3 million children left the public schools during the pandemic.
*  The results from the most recent national assessment of educational progress, known
*  as the Nation's Report Card, revealed the largest average score decline in reading since
*  1990, and the first average score decline in math since 1969.
*  Schools have reported major increases in rates of student depression, anxiety, and
*  trauma.
*  School districts around the country are experiencing severe teacher shortages.
*  Last fall, a Gallup poll found that the percentage of adults who are satisfied with the nation's
*  public schools had fallen to 42 percent, a 20-year low.
*  This crisis has political consequences.
*  The pandemic closures and classroom culture wars have fueled the revival of the dormant
*  school choice movement, with Republican-led states around the country passing an array
*  of far-reaching school voucher bills.
*  These bills come in different forms but share a common goal, to enable parents to move their
*  children out of America's government-run education system en masse.
*  All of the prospective Republican presidential candidates for 2024 have committed to building
*  on this growing movement, whose roots can be traced back more than 50 years to the battle
*  over desegregation.
*  The same pandemic closures that demonstrated how central public schools are to the communities
*  they serve also became the inciting event for an unprecedented effort to dismantle them.
*  The public education system may not be very popular right now, but both Democrats and
*  Republicans tend to like their local schools and their children's teachers.
*  The unions that represent those teachers, however, are more polarizing.
*  One reason for this is that they are actively involved in partisan politics, and more specifically,
*  are closely aligned with the Democrats, a reality powerfully driven home during the
*  pandemic.
*  A study by Brown University's Annenberg Institute found that Democratic districts, with correspondingly
*  strong teachers unions, return to in-person learning more slowly and gradually than Republican
*  districts with weaker unions.
*  In some ways, Randi Weingarten and the AFT, the Union boss and Big Labor, are a logical,
*  even inevitable target for the GOP.
*  A frequent knock on the AFT is that it puts teachers before students, a framing neatly
*  encapsulated by a quote attributed to the union's former president, Al Shanker.
*  When school children start paying union dues, that's when I'll start representing the interests
*  of school children.
*  Shanker's biographer, Richard Kallenberg, found no record of Shanker's ever saying
*  this and doesn't think he ever did, but that hasn't stopped the union's critics from citing it.
*  Weingarten has a rebuttal.
*  Good working conditions for teachers make good learning conditions for students.
*  But Weingarten does in fact represent teachers, not students.
*  Often, such as when it comes to issues like classroom size or school budgets, their interests align.
*  Sometimes, they don't.
*  For a period during the pandemic, the two groups' apparent interests diverged, and a series of
*  fault lines started opening across the country, separating not only Republicans from Democrats,
*  but also parents from teachers, centrist Democrats from progressives, and urban Black parents
*  from suburban white parents, and even dividing the teachers' union itself.
*  These fault lines widened as the reopening debates merged into fights over how schools
*  should deal with the teaching of the country's racial history, as well as sexuality and gender identity.
*  What became increasingly clear to me over the last several months, as I spoke to dozens of
*  politicians, political consultants, union leaders, parent activists, and education scholars
*  about the convulsions in American education, is that it's no longer possible to separate
*  education from politics, and that public schools are more vulnerable than they've ever been.
*  How did Randy Weingarten wind up at the center of the 2024 Republican primary?
*  The only way to answer that question is to reexamine America's education wars
*  and the competing political agendas that are driving them.
*  Oh, goodness, no, not at all, Pompeo answered when I asked if he was, perhaps, being hyperbolic
*  in his remarks about Weingarten. It's not just about Ms. Weingarten, but she has been the most
*  visible face of the destruction of American education. In the chaotic early months of the
*  pandemic, teachers were celebrated as essential workers, heroically continuing to serve America's
*  children from their homes, often with limited resources and inadequate technology. But during
*  the summer of 2020, things started to shift. There was already early research showing that
*  students were suffering academically from remote learning. Schools across Europe had begun reopening
*  without any major outbreaks, and many of America's private and parochial schools were making plans to
*  resume in-person learning at the start of the new school year. A lot of public school parents wanted
*  their children to be back in the classroom, too. But many teachers seemed resistant to the idea.
*  Because of the decentralized structure of America's public education system,
*  which has some 14,000 different school districts, the federal government could not order schools to
*  reopen for in-person learning. But in July 2020, President Trump threatened to withhold federal
*  funds from those that didn't. His education secretary, Betsy DeVos, echoed his sentiments,
*  demanding that the nation's schools be fully operational by the fall without providing a
*  specific plan for doing so. Many members of the AFT remained worried about putting themselves,
*  their families, and their communities at risk. The AFT had issued its own reopening plan in late April,
*  calling for adequate personal protective equipment, a temporary suspension of formal
*  teacher performance evaluations, a limit on student testing, a cancellation of student loan debt,
*  and a $750 billion federal aid package to help schools prepare to reopen safely and facilitate
*  a real recovery for all our communities. Weingarten did not believe the Trump
*  administration was giving the schools what teachers needed to return to work safely.
*  She publicly denounced Trump and DeVos' call to reopen as reckless, callous, and cruel. And the
*  AFT passed a resolution supporting local strikes if schools were forced to reopen in areas where a
*  variety of safety conditions hadn't been met. As if to underscore the point, some teachers took to
*  the streets in protest with mock coffins. Florida became a test case. Even as the state's COVID
*  death rate was surging in July, its Department of Education issued an emergency order requiring
*  schools to fully reopen in August. The state's largest teachers union, the Florida Education
*  Association, affiliated with both the AFT and the NEA, sued DeSantis and his education commissioner,
*  Richard Corcoran, among others, to block the reopenings, arguing that the order violated the
*  state's constitution, which guarantees Florida residents the right to safe and secure public
*  schools. At a virtual news conference announcing the lawsuit, Weingarten accused DeSantis of being
*  in intense denial. After some Florida schools started reopening, an AFT political action
*  committee produced a TV ad attacking Trump, citing claims that schools were becoming
*  superspreader sites and that children were being used as guinea pigs. As the lawsuit was working
*  its way through the legal system, the union won in the lower court but lost on appeal. Florida was
*  holding its biannual school board elections, and the prospective return to in-person learning became
*  the defining issue in many races. In Brevard County, Tina Descovitch, the incumbent, was in
*  favor of an immediate return to the classroom and opposed mask mandates. She was challenged by a
*  public school speech-language pathologist, Jennifer Jenkins, who called for a more cautious approach,
*  including a mask mandate for all but the youngest children. Jenkins easily won the late August
*  election, but Descovitch was just getting started. She called Tiffany Justice, a fellow school board
*  member in nearby Indian River County, to suggest that they create their own parents' rights group,
*  Moms for Liberty. We've got to do something here, Justice recalled Descovitch is telling her. We
*  have to help these parents because they're trying to step up and speak out and the schools are just
*  slamming them at every turn. Other parents across the political spectrum started organizing, too.
*  Many public schools hadn't fully reopened for the start of the new school year, and they were
*  frustrated. They wrote op-eds, held rallies, or met via Zoom with school board members and other
*  elected officials, often finding themselves at odds with local teachers' unions and union-backed
*  school board members. The first fault lines had started to open.
*  By the fall of 2020, the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer and the rise of
*  the Black Lives Matter movement had prompted a national reckoning over race, as well as an
*  ensuing backlash. The politics of the pandemic had begun to merge with the culture wars,
*  and both were playing out most vividly in the American classroom. An esoteric academic term,
*  critical race theory, or CRT, had improbably become the rallying cry for a conservative campaign
*  focused on the teaching of the nation's racial history. President Trump, running for re-election,
*  eagerly took up the cause, blaming decades of left-wing indoctrination in our schools for the
*  Black Lives Matter protests and urging America's parents to fight back against efforts to teach
*  their children hateful lies about this country. The AFT championed the new movement for racial
*  equity, committing publicly to the fight to end systemic racism in America. Some of the AFT's
*  locals went further. The Chicago Teachers' Union took to the streets to demand that the city's
*  Board of Education cancel a $33 million contract between Chicago's public schools and its police
*  department for the safety officers who staff the city's public schools. United Teachers Los
*  Angeles helped lead a successful fight to press its school district to slash its police budget
*  by $25 million and use the money instead to hire more counselors, psychologists, and social workers.
*  That October, Weingarten embarked on a cross-country bus tour to get out the vote
*  for Joe Biden. His Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, had not always been in sync with the AFT.
*  The union opposed elements of Obama's Race to the Top program, which sent money to states that
*  reformed their public education systems by, among other things, weakening teacher tenure,
*  introducing data-driven accountability measures, and adding more non-unionized charter schools.
*  Biden, by contrast, vowed to focus on neighborhood public schools rather than charters and
*  criticized the standardized testing regimes and teacher evaluations that were a hallmark of Race
*  to the Top. Weingarten's name was even floated as a candidate for Secretary of Education.
*  She didn't get the job, but she and the head of the NEA, Becky Pringle, were invited to the
*  White House on the day after Biden's inauguration. The teachers' unions finally had a true ally in
*  the Oval Office. The First Lady, Jill Biden, taught at a public community college herself.
*  I sleep with an NEA member every night, President Biden would later quip.
*  The new administration gave teachers preferential access to the COVID vaccine,
*  behind some other essential workers, but ahead of the general population.
*  Biden had pledged to quickly reopen America's schools, and the AFT was communicating with
*  top officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about its guidelines for doing so,
*  suggesting that the agency add a provision allowing for its recommendations to be revisited
*  if a highly contagious COVID variant emerged. But the anger that had been unleashed by the
*  pandemic closures and the culture wars had not abated. Justice Andeskovich,
*  the former Florida School Board members, incorporated Moms for Liberty in early 2021
*  with a far more ambitious and political agenda than simply advocating a return to maskless,
*  in-person classes. As the group's mission statement explained, it was dedicated to
*  fighting for the survival of America by unifying, educating, and empowering parents
*  to defend their parental rights at all levels of government.
*  The group built its brand with bumper magnets and t-shirts emblazoned with the motto,
*  We do not co-parent with the government. It was embraced by the right-wing media,
*  and then by donors eager to turn it into a national movement, while nurturing its grassroots image,
*  mirroring the model created by the Tea Party, the quasi-populist uprising fueled by conservative
*  billionaires and Fox News. The former Fox host, Megyn Kelly, headlined a fundraising event in
*  Florida, speaking about, as Justice recalled, the woke ideology coming out of America's classrooms.
*  Moms for Liberty soon expanded beyond Florida. That summer, a chapter in Tennessee presented
*  an 11-page letter of complaint to the state's Department of Education, objecting to a curriculum
*  that it said, focuses repeatedly and daily on very dark and divisive slivers of American history
*  and works to sow feelings of resentment, shame of one's skin color, and or fear.
*  After several Republican states passed laws limiting the teaching of race-related subjects
*  and banning CRT, Weingarten gave a speech citing a historian who had compared their efforts
*  to the censorship of the Soviet regime. A clip of the speech spent days in heavy rotation on Fox News,
*  and it inspired an editorial in the Wall Street Journal. The article was published in the same
*  editorial in the Wall Street Journal. The teachers unions go woke.
*  It was not Glenn Youngkin's plan to turn Virginia's 2021 governor's race into a
*  referendum on America's battles over education. Initially, he was just hoping to prevent his
*  opponent, Terry McAuliffe, from owning an issue that historically favored Democrats.
*  We couldn't afford to let them take the fight to us, Jeff Roe, one of Youngkin's chief strategists,
*  told me. By almost every measure, Youngkin, a former private equity executive with no political
*  experience, was the underdog. McAuliffe, a Democratic stalwart dating back to the Clinton
*  presidency, served as Virginia's governor between 2014 and 2018. A state law barring governors from
*  serving consecutive terms prevented him from running for reelection. Biden had beaten Trump
*  by 10 points in Virginia, and McAuliffe led in the early polls, but Virginia's schools had been
*  among the last on the East Coast to fully reopen. And the lingering bitterness from these pandemic
*  closures had formed a politically combustible mix with the rising culture wars. Amid the national
*  racial reckoning of 2020, Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Fairfax
*  County, one of the top public high schools in the nation, had jettisoned its admissions exam,
*  prompting a lawsuit by 17 families, many of them Asian American, who viewed the change as a form of
*  discrimination against their children. Some of the most bitter fights were unfolding in suburban
*  Loudoun County, where a proposal to allow transgender children to choose which bathrooms and pronouns
*  they wished to use had sparked an angry backlash among conservative parents. The tensions were
*  later exacerbated by news of a sexual assault in a high school girl's bathroom perpetrated by a boy
*  who was wearing a skirt at the time. Loudoun's increasingly contentious school board meetings
*  became spectator events, attracting the sustained attention of right-wing media outlets like Fox
*  News and the New York Post. Youngkin held Save Our Schools rallies and pledged to ban CRT from
*  the state schools, but his campaign's internal education polls revealed a wide range of voter
*  priorities across the state. The race and gender issues that resonated with his base, Trump voters,
*  weren't going to be enough to win. He micro-targeted other education voters with different ads,
*  it was a scattershot approach though, at least until a gubernatorial debate in late September.
*  During his tenure as governor, McAuliffe had vetoed a bill, prompted by a mother who objected to her
*  high school senior sons reading Toni Morrison's Beloved in an AP English class, that would have
*  enabled parents to prevent their children from studying material they deemed sexually explicit.
*  When Youngkin criticized that decision on the debate stage, McAuliffe shot back,
*  I don't think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.
*  Recognizing that they had just been handed a political gift, Youngkin's staff cobbled together
*  a digital and TV ad that very night, hoping to take advantage of the apparent gaffe before McAuliffe
*  tried to clarify it. I was sure he was going to walk it back on Morning Joe, Roe told me.
*  Instead, McAuliffe stood by his comment, saying that states and local school boards should have
*  authority over what's taught in schools. Youngkin unified his diffuse education campaign under a new
*  phrase, parents matter, printing up t-shirts and bumper stickers and holding parents matter rallies
*  in suburban and exurban counties that supported Biden in 2020. McAuliffe's quote became the
*  centerpiece of a rolling series of ads, accusing him of going on the attack against parents.
*  A longtime critic of organized labor, Youngkin also sought to drive a wedge between teachers
*  and their unions, promising to devote at least $100 million to raise teachers' salaries,
*  while at the same time saying that McAuliffe would bout with special interest allies
*  rather than doing what's best for children. A vast majority of Virginia's teachers belong to
*  the NEA, which tends to cover more rural areas, not the AFT, whose members are generally concentrated
*  in big cities. But Weingarten was friendly with McAuliffe from the Clinton days and was supporting
*  his candidacy on Twitter and cable news, and the AFT was helping him develop his education platform.
*  Weingarten told me that she called McAuliffe after the debate to tell him that he was wrong,
*  that parents should have a role in their children's education.
*  Terry made a very bad mistake, which Youngkin capitalized on, she said. Through a spokesman,
*  McAuliffe said that he talked to Weingarten regularly during the campaign, but has no
*  recollection of her criticizing his remark. By the fall of 2021, America's public schools
*  were fully open, but mask mandates were still being hotly contested. Weingarten had been
*  working to try to rebuild trust between some families and their schools. In late September,
*  just a couple of days after the McAuliffe debate, she held a virtual town hall on mask mandates with
*  Open Schools USA, an anti-masking right-wing parents' rights group that was rallying families
*  to pull their children out of public schools in an effort to foster open dialogue with the
*  union's critics. Under Weingarten, who was elected president of the AFT in 2008, the national union
*  has gone all in on electoral politics, significantly increasing its political spending in the belief
*  that the best way to serve its rank and file is by electing Democrats. The AFT gave more than
*  $1 million to McAuliffe, and Weingarten even knocked on doors for him and Alexandria.
*  But Yonkin had the momentum in the final weeks of the race. His candidacy received another boost in
*  October when Attorney General Merrick Garland ordered the FBI to help address the rising threats
*  of violence towards some school board members. The order stemmed from a letter written to the
*  Biden administration by the National School Boards Association, asking that federal law
*  enforcement address threats against public school officials that could be the equivalent
*  to a form of domestic terrorism. But Republican lawmakers and the right-wing media seized on the
*  language in the letter to falsely accuse Garland of labeling parents domestic terrorists. Yonkin
*  quickly exploited the opportunity, releasing an ad claiming that the FBI was trying to
*  silence parents. On the night before the election, Weingarten headed down to Virginia to warm up the
*  crowd at McAuliffe's closing rally in Fairfax County. She was eager to be on hand for the final
*  push, and her staff asked for her to be given a speaking role at the rally. Because she had been
*  such a generous and loyal supporter of McAuliffe's, the campaign didn't want to say no, even though
*  some Democrats worried that they could be handing Yonkin another gift. Politically speaking,
*  Weingarten played perfectly into Yonkin's Parents Matter campaign. That spring, a right-wing watchdog
*  group, Americans for Public Trust, had gotten hold of email communications between top officials at
*  the AFT and the CDC about the agency's school reopening guidelines through the Freedom of
*  Information Act and had passed them on to the New York Post. The tabloid, which had been gleefully
*  attacking Weingarten for years, dubbing her Wine-W-H-I-N-E-Garten, trumpeted the story.
*  Powerful teachers' union influenced CDC on school reopenings, documents show. The rest of the
*  right-wing media and numerous Republican officials instantly jumped on the narrative.
*  Senator Susan Collins of Maine grilled the CDC's director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky,
*  at a committee hearing over what she called the CDC's secret negotiations with the teachers' union.
*  Weingarten told me that the CDC had solicited the AFT's input and that the union hadn't suggested
*  anything that the agency wasn't already considering incorporating into its guidelines.
*  But the appearance of a partisan union leader who had privately discussed the future of the nation's
*  schools with a government agency could be counterproductive in Virginia's charged political
*  climate. Youngkin's staff was giddy at the prospect. I wanted to send them a gift basket,
*  Kristen Davison, another senior Youngkin strategist, told me. It was almost as good as when Stacey
*  Abrams came. Republican elected officials around the country took pot shots at their emerging villain.
*  The union boss responsible for shutting down schools is the final surrogate for Terry McAuliffe's
*  failing campaign, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas wrote on Twitter. Virginians should vote accordingly.
*  Youngkin won narrowly, motivating the GOP base and making critical inroads in Loudon,
*  but should voted overwhelmingly for Biden. For a closer for a campaign, he would think he would
*  bring in a showstopper. Betsy DeVos gloated on Fox News on election night. I guess in this case,
*  he did bring in a showstopper in Randy Weingarten because she definitely stopped the show for kids
*  across the country. To Republicans, Weingarten may be too progressive, but to some members of
*  her own union, she is not progressive enough. As the pandemic dragged on, she found herself caught
*  between the wishes of the democratic establishment she did not want to alienate and the left-leaning
*  rank and file she represented. In Chicago, this tension came down in early 2022 to the most
*  elemental question for unions, whether or not to strike. At the time, the new Omicron variant was
*  surging and Illinois was experiencing a record number of COVID cases and hospitalizations.
*  The AFT's left-wing local, the Chicago Teachers Union, was concerned about sending its 25,000
*  members back to the classroom after winter break. The union was hearing similar worries
*  from the black families whose children make up a large percentage of the 320,000 students in
*  Chicago's public schools. Many white suburban and ex-urban parents had been desperate to see
*  their children return to the classroom and were now committed to keeping them there.
*  But many urban black parents who tended to live in smaller homes with more family members,
*  had generally lower vaccination rates, and had lost more loved ones to the pandemic,
*  had been and remained wary, especially with the new variant spiking.
*  The union demanded mandatory testing for all teachers and students or a temporary return to
*  remote learning. Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a Democrat, balked. President Biden and other prominent
*  Democrats had been unambiguous about their desire for the nation's schools to remain open.
*  And the recent governor's election in Virginia had underscored the political
*  danger of introducing more disruptions to in-person learning, especially with the 2022
*  midterms just around the corner. For Weingarten and the National Union,
*  a strike in the country's third largest school system would obviously be politically costly.
*  The insurgent group that leads the CTU first came together in 2008, when the bipartisan
*  education reform movement was sweeping across the country, dividing the Democratic Party.
*  Centrist billionaires and centrist Democrats joined forces to lead the effort to introduce
*  more testing, accountability, and free market competition to the public schools.
*  But the more progressive wing of the party viewed these measures as an attack
*  on the very institution of public education, unleashing the forces of capitalism
*  on what is supposed to be a public good. In Chicago, the reform efforts were led by
*  Arne Duncan, the chief executive of the city's public school district and President Obama's
*  future education secretary. Neoliberal education reform hit Chicago like a ton of bricks.
*  Jesse Sharkey, a high school history teacher, told me,
*  Sharkey was a leader of this insurgency and would go on to become president of the CTU
*  from 2018 to 2022. He'd flip on the TV or pick up a newspaper, and you couldn't avoid hearing our
*  so-called leaders trashing our schools, talking about their culture of failure, he says. It was
*  an environment that was downright hostile to public education. Sharkey and his fellow insurgents
*  didn't believe the national union was fighting aggressively enough against these democratic
*  reformers. Tapping into Chicago's long history of community-based organizing,
*  they built their own grassroots movement within the union called the Caucus of Rank and File
*  Educators, or CORE. Led by Karen Lewis, a chemistry teacher and union activist,
*  CORE challenged the CTU's incumbent leadership in 2010 and won control of the Chicago union.
*  Two years later, after the city's new Democratic mayor, President Obama's former chief of staff,
*  Rahm Emanuel, embarked on an ambitious program to close public schools and replace them with
*  charters, the CTU called Chicago's first teacher strike in 25 years. While the CTU was voting on
*  the strike authorization, Weingarten arrived in Chicago to appear on a panel with Emanuel
*  at a conference hosted by the Clinton Global Initiative. It was a stunning turn of events
*  that spoke to the tension between the AFT and its left wing. For the political health of the union,
*  Weingarten felt she needed to preserve her relationships with the country's most powerful
*  democratic leaders, many of whom, like Emanuel, were centrist reformers. As the 2012 strike wore
*  on, Emanuel tried to turn the city against the teachers, accusing them of using Chicago's
*  children as pawns, and unsuccessfully sought a court order to force them to return to work.
*  After seven days, the city backed down. The union won major concessions, including a 16%
*  raise over four years, and the right-foot teachers who were laid off as part of Emanuel's ongoing
*  school closures to be given priority for positions at other schools. The strike instantly became a
*  galvanizing event for the union's more progressive members. Not only does CORE still control the CTU,
*  but like-minded left-wing slates have since taken control of AFT locals in several other cities, too.
*  Including Los Angeles and Baltimore. These insurgent caucuses are unified by what they call
*  social justice unionism. They see public schools' ongoing struggles to educate their students
*  as inseparable from the larger societal and economic issues facing their working-class members
*  and the poor communities whose children dominate their classrooms.
*  We are trying to promote a brand of unionism that goes all out in its fight for educational justice
*  and is brave about taking on conflicts, Sharkey says. In some ways, we're less careful about who
*  we piss off nationally. There is a natural tension between these insurgent movements
*  and the more establishment-oriented national union. In 2015, some rank-and-file members protested
*  the AFT's decision to issue an early endorsement of Hillary Clinton, to whom Weingarten is close,
*  was running against the pro-labor Bernie Sanders. But the tension is about more than just politics.
*  It also goes to the heart of the AFT's identity. To these caucuses, the union's power comes from
*  the collective strength of its members, from the bottom up, which can conflict with the top-down
*  leadership style of Weingarten, who has cultivated a distinct public profile, sometimes characterized
*  by her own tendency toward political hyperbole. An impulsive user of Twitter, she has been known
*  to send out the occasional overheated message. During the pandemic, when DeSantis supporters
*  were selling Don't Fauci My Florida merchandise, including beer koozies, on the GOP's WinRed website,
*  she wrote, Disgusting. Millions of Floridians are going to die from Ron DeSantis' ignorance.
*  She later apologized for the tweet. Two days after returning from winter break in January 2022,
*  with their demands still unmet, the CTU called a strike. The union isn't stupid, Sharkey, who
*  was president at the time, told me, We knew people were sick of the pandemic. But he went on,
*  For better or for worse, we're a union that strikes. We didn't think it would be an easy
*  or strategically wise thing, but there was a principle around it. It was something we had to do.
*  The union already had a contentious relationship with Lightfoot, dating back to an 11-day strike
*  over wages and class sizes in 2019 that ended with the city making major concessions.
*  This time, though, the mayor had public opinion on her side, and she leveraged it in a flurry of media
*  interviews, accusing the CTU of holding Chicago's children hostage. Lightfoot had long seen the
*  AFT's Local as a political movement whose ambitions extended well beyond protecting the rights of its
*  workers. I think, ultimately, they'd like to take over not only Chicago public schools,
*  but take over running the city government, she told the Times in 2021.
*  The 2022 strike quickly became a political nightmare for national Democrats.
*  A Democratic mayor was at war with a Democratic union, shutting down Chicago schools at a moment
*  when children were finally back in the classroom and the country was just beginning to confront
*  the learning loss and emotional trauma caused by the pandemic. Splinter groups of teachers
*  in northern California were also planning sick-outs in the face of the Omicron surge.
*  The Chicago strike put Winegarden in a difficult position.
*  Publicly, she supported the CTU while also saying that children needed to be in the classroom.
*  Behind the scenes, she was calling and texting Sharkey constantly, offering to do anything she
*  could, even arrange a call with people at the White House to help press Lightfoot and end the
*  strike. After a few days, under intensifying public pressure, the CTU's members voted to return to
*  work. They had lost this battle, but they already had their sights on a bigger one,
*  the city's upcoming mayoral election.
*  In late October, just before the 2022 midterms, the results from the first full national assessment
*  of educational progress since the start of the pandemic were released, revealing that 40% of
*  the country's eighth-grade public school students were not proficient in math and 32% were not
*  proficient in reading. The strikingly low scores instantly became a GOP talking point.
*  The culprit wasn't the pandemic, schools, or teachers, but the unions and Democratic politicians
*  beholden to them. We cannot let the nation forget how teachers' unions tried to hold our children's
*  futures for ransom, said Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, then the ranking Republican
*  on the House Committee on Education in the Workforce. These union bosses and the politicians who
*  enabled them must be held accountable. Republicans up and down the ballot accused their Democratic
*  opponents of carrying water for the teachers' unions. A week before the election, Foxx News
*  ran a segment headlined, Have the teachers' unions sold out your kids to the Democrats?
*  Christopher Ruffo, the right-wing activist who manufactured the obsession with CRT two years
*  earlier, was now on Foxx News, railing against another crisis. The academic queer theory that
*  he charged was being mainlined into America's public schools, while Republican candidates
*  condemned the grooming of children to identify as different genders in the nation's classrooms.
*  Many Republican candidates pledged their allegiance to a Parents' Bill of Rights,
*  requiring schools to provide information on reading lists, curriculums, and whether a family's
*  child used another name or pronoun in school. The AFT spent in excess of $20 million in the
*  2022 midterms, more than it ever had in an off-year election, and Weingarten campaigned
*  tirelessly with high-profile Democrats around the country. Her arrival on the stump, invariably
*  inspiring glee among local Republican leaders, when she appeared in Michigan with Governor
*  Gretchen Whitmer, one GOP pundit, Kayleigh McGee White, described her on Foxx Business Network as
*  the kiss of death. Whitmer won easily, as did many other Democrats whose opponents had railed
*  against drag queen shows for children or LGBTQ-themed books in school libraries.
*  But Republican candidates who campaigned on another education issue, school choice,
*  fared much better. As a political matter, all the education battles that had erupted since the start
*  of the pandemic, over school closures, over how the country's racial history should be taught,
*  over what sort of role parents ought to have in the classroom, were really about the same thing.
*  Whether America's children should continue to be educated in government-run public schools?
*  Did the pandemic and the culture wars reveal the indispensability of these schools to their
*  communities and to the broader fabric of the nation? Or did they only underscore their
*  inherent limitations, in effect, making the case for school choice? It was the University
*  of Chicago economist Milton Friedman who first proposed the modern concept of school vouchers
*  a paper in 1955. Friedman was a champion of free markets, and his idea was to leverage the
*  transformative power of capitalism to prod schools to compete for families' dollars.
*  But vouchers served another purpose, too. The Supreme Court had just ruled on Brown v. Board
*  of Education, and many white Americans were worried about the looming prospect of being
*  forced to send their children to desegregated schools. Friedman saw an opening for his proposal,
*  writing, Under such a system, there can develop exclusively white schools,
*  exclusively colored schools, and mixed schools.
*  Thirty years later, with Friedman serving as an economic adviser, President Reagan tried
*  repeatedly to introduce federal school voucher legislation. One of his most vocal opponents was
*  Al Shanker, then the AFT's president, who argued that choice might be the point of shopping malls,
*  but it was not the point of education, nor was it the reason taxpayers were expected to fund the
*  nation's public schools. We do so not to satisfy the individual wants of parents and students,
*  but because of the public interest in producing an educated citizenry capable of exercising the
*  rights of liberty and being productive members of society. Even Congress, where Republicans held the
*  Senate majority, considered Reagan's voucher proposals too radical. But the concept endured.
*  In the 1990s, vouchers were championed by Christian conservatives like Paul Weirich,
*  a founder of the Heritage Foundation and mentor to Justice Clarence Thomas.
*  Weirich believed that the nation's public schools had become morally decadent institutions,
*  and argued that the only answer was for Christians to educate their children themselves,
*  ideally with government money. Over the years, some states experimented with limited voucher
*  programs, typically designed to target discrete populations like children with special needs.
*  But the pandemic created an opening for voucher advocates to think more ambitiously
*  and move more aggressively. In fact, this had been the plan almost from the very beginning.
*  Two months into the school closures in the spring of 2020, Cardinal Timothy Dolan,
*  the Catholic Archbishop of New York, asked DeVos, then the education secretary and a long-time
*  supporter of school choice, in an interview on SiriusXM radio, if she intended to utilize
*  this particular crisis to ensure that justice is finally done to our kids and the parents who
*  choose to send them to faith-based schools. DeVos answered unequivocally, yes, absolutely.
*  In 2021, at least 18 states created new school choice programs or expanded existing ones,
*  and more followed suit in 2022. Some of these new programs represent a significant departure
*  from those of the past. Known collectively as universal voucher programs, they are available
*  to everyone and can be applied toward any kind of school. The goal is not merely to
*  disrupt public education, but to defund and dismantle it. For years, the country's lower
*  courts largely agreed that spending taxpayer money on religious schools was unconstitutional.
*  But last summer, the Supreme Court created a new precedent, ruling that it was in fact
*  unconstitutional for voucher programs, in this case one in rural Maine, to exclude religious schools.
*  DeVos, now back in the private sector, is one of the leading funders of this new national
*  voucher campaign, primarily through an organization that she helped found
*  called the American Federation for Children. The group and its affiliates spent $9 million
*  on school choice campaigns in 2022, at least $2.5 million of which came directly from DeVos
*  and her husband. They spent much of this money in the primaries, turning support for school choice
*  into a litmus test and targeting Republican incumbents opposed to it.
*  Three-quarters of the candidates they supported won. There wasn't a red wave or a blue wave in
*  the midterms, but there was a school choice wave. Corey DeAngelis, a senior fellow at the
*  American Federation for Children, wrote to me in an email. Echoing wiry sentiments about the
*  moral decadence of American public education, DeAngelis quoted Vodi Boncombe, a Christian
*  homeschooling advocate. DeAngelis identified Weingarten as a useful political foil long
*  before Mike Pompeo. He has been trolling her relentlessly on Twitter since 2021,
*  ostentatiously thanking her for starting the school choice revolution. In March, at the
*  annual conservative political action conference in suburban Washington, he posed with a life-size
*  cardboard cutout of her clutching an award labeled, Threat to America's Children, his left thumb
*  raised in approval. Lori Lightfoot, the Mayor of Chicago, was right about the local teachers'
*  union's political ambitions. In February, Brandon Johnson, a former middle school teacher and paid
*  union organizer, challenged her in the city's mayoral election. It was a long shot. One early
*  poll put his support at 3 percent. But for the CTU, the Johnson campaign was a natural progression.
*  To pursue their broader agenda, which reaches beyond education into areas like housing and
*  policing, they needed the kind of power that can come only from winning partisan political elections.
*  And they had both a powerful grassroots movement and a source of campaign funds,
*  in the form of members' dues that could be leveraged to support Johnson's candidacy.
*  Johnson's campaign was underwritten largely by the teachers' unions. Though the AFT and the CTU had
*  their differences in the past, they have become more closely aligned in recent years.
*  While there are still some divisions within the Democratic Party over education policy,
*  the bipartisan education reform movement that once posed such a formidable existential threat
*  to the AFT is a shadow of its former self. The threat to the AFT is now partisan,
*  which means that Weingarten is no longer facing as much pressure from centrist Democrats.
*  Backed by the financial and organizational muscle of the national and local teachers' unions,
*  Johnson knocked Lightfoot out of the two-person runoff, making her the first incumbent mayor in
*  Chicago to be unseated after a single term in 40 years. By now, Pompeo, Tim Scott, Marco Rubio,
*  Ron DeSantis, Donald Trump, and the rest of the Republican Party were busy elevating education
*  to a central plank in its 2024 platform, and in the process, transforming Weingarten into the new
*  Hillary, a GOP stand-in for everything that was wrong with America. The Republican-led
*  House-select subcommittee on the coronavirus pandemic was continuing to build its case that
*  Weingarten and the AFT exerted undue influence over the CDC's school reopening guidelines,
*  summoning Weingarten to appear in Washington on April 26th at a hearing titled,
*  The Consequences of School Closures. But Weingarten was building her own case.
*  Public education was now itself a hyperpartisan issue, and she addressed it in hyperpartisan terms
*  in a fiery speech at the National Press Club. Calling out by name some of the people who had
*  demonized her since the pandemic, including Betsy DeVos, she described the ongoing effort to defund
*  public schools as nothing less than a threat to cornerstones of community, of our democracy,
*  our economy, and our nation. She pointed to studies that have shown that vouchers don't
*  improve student achievement, characterizing them as a back door into private and parochial schools
*  that are not subject to the same federal civil rights laws as public institutions
*  and can therefore promote discrimination. Our public schools shouldn't be pawns for politicians'
*  ambitions, she thundered, moving toward her emotional conclusion. They shouldn't be defunded
*  or destroyed by ideologues. Like the Virginia's governor's race one and a half years earlier,
*  Chicago's mayoral runoff became, at least in part, a referendum on education. The effects
*  of the pandemic on Chicago's public schools have been profound. More than 33,000 students have left
*  the school system since the fall of 2020, and the recent national assessment of educational progress
*  scores showed steep declines in math and a widening achievement gap between white and black students.
*  Brandon Johnson's opponent, Paul Vallis, ran Chicago's public schools in the late 1990s.
*  Chicago has no Republican party to speak of, but Vallis, a vocal proponent of charter schools
*  and vouchers, was the conservative candidate. In 2009, he said he was more of a Republican
*  than a Democrat. He was supported by the local business community and endorsed by the city's
*  police union. A group affiliated with the American Federation for Children spent $60,285
*  on a pro-Vallis digital media effort, but Arne Duncan and a number of other centrist Democrats
*  endorsed Vallis, too. On the eve of the April runoff election, Weingarten headed to Chicago
*  to speak at a Johnson political rally headlined by Bernie Sanders. Both the AFT and the CTU
*  continued to funnel money into Johnson's campaign as the election approached. Their combined
*  contributions totaling $4.6 million. All of this stuff is about power, observed a local community
*  activist, J. Mal Green, who had run in the first round of the election but didn't make the runoff
*  and was now supporting Vallis. When Johnson narrowly won, it was a stunning upset, not just for the
*  candidate but for the left. Even as the Republicans were ramping up their attacks on Weingarten
*  and on the institution of public education, the teachers unions had effectively elected the mayor
*  of America's third largest city, who was himself an avowedly progressive union organizer promising
*  to raise taxes on the rich, reform the police, and increase funding for the city's schools.
*  Maybe Pompeo hadn't been wrong, at least as far as his own party was concerned. It was those who
*  had underestimated the political power of the unions who were mistaken. They said this would
*  never happen, Johnson said in his victory speech. If they didn't know, now they know.
