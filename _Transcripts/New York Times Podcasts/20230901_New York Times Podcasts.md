# Arizonaâ€™s Pipe Dream
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nPRmfMfbLE)
*  It's just past 7 a.m. in Phoenix. I'm standing at the top of Camelback Mountain. It's the
*  highest point in the area and I can see for miles in every direction. And what you see
*  for miles in every direction is green. There is an unbelievable lushness to this place,
*  not just in terms of green lawns and golf courses, but even the tree canopy. And if
*  you drive an hour in any direction, the contrast couldn't be more clear. You hit almost totally
*  barren desert. And so the first impression and the overwhelming impression that you get
*  from looking down on Phoenix from above is it's a miracle. Somehow humans have managed
*  to build a garden in the desert and a garden whose scale is impossible to capture.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi and this is The Daily. A comprehensive Times
*  investigation reveals that in much of the United States, Americans are pumping out groundwater
*  at alarming rates and that this essential source of water for much of the country has
*  reached a critical point. Today, my colleague Christopher Flavell goes to the state at the
*  forefront of this crisis and looks at one especially controversial idea to address it.
*  It's Friday, September 1st. So Chris, tell me about this groundwater crisis that you
*  and our colleagues spent months reporting on.
*  So almost every part of the US relies on groundwater for drinking, for farming, for basically fueling
*  modern society. And that water has built up deep underground over thousands, in many cases,
*  in aquifers. It's pumped up through wells. But what's important is that water isn't just
*  replaced by rain. Even hurricanes like the one in Florida this week won't be enough to
*  replenish them once that water is pumped out. In many cases, it's effectively gone. So what
*  we did is something that no one else has done. Really, we built a comprehensive database
*  using data we could find all around the country trying to get the best picture possible to
*  see what the health of American aquifers is, how much water we're using, how much is
*  left, what are the consequences. And what we found is that in much of the country, almost
*  everywhere in the country, there's a problem with pumping out groundwater too fast at a
*  rate that means in many places, we're at risk of running out. And if that happened, it would
*  fundamentally change those places. And not just in the West, but across the US, places
*  like Maryland, and Kansas, and Arkansas, and New York, and Minnesota, places you don't
*  think of as having water problems that are actually quite at risk. Wow. And there's one
*  state that maybe is in the most dire position around groundwater, and also is sort of at
*  the forefront of trying to figure out how to respond to it. And that's Arizona. Arizona
*  is limiting new construction around Phoenix as the state's water supply continues to dwindle.
*  State officials say there isn't enough groundwater for housing construction that has already
*  been approved. This is now a reality check. This is people in Arizona finally saying,
*  you know what, you can't live without water and we're running out of our water. Exhibit
*  A in that crisis is the recent decision at the beginning of June when the governor, Katie
*  Hobbs announced, Today I'm directing the Arizona Department of Water Resources to publish the
*  management area groundwater model that the amount of groundwater underneath Maricopa County isn't
*  enough to support all the homes that have already been approved for construction. If we do nothing,
*  we could face a 4% shortfall in groundwater supplies over the next 100 years. And they said any
*  developers that want approval to build new subdivisions have to find some other source of
*  water aside from groundwater. That's why as required by law, we will pause approvals of new
*  assured water supply determinations that rely on pumping groundwater, which is just a real jolt
*  to a system built on rapid and really endless growth. And it could mean a deep shift in the
*  way people live and work in Arizona.
*  Like, what exactly do you mean? Like not having enough water to actually drink and bathe? Yeah,
*  having enough water to prepare your food, to bathe, to wash your clothes, to water your lawn. You know,
*  if you spend time in Arizona, it's a real land of bounty, right? People aren't living lives where
*  they have to ration anything. But this would begin to shift Arizona into a place where there
*  just isn't enough of this fundamental component of life. I mean, it sounds like the beginning of the
*  end for growth in Arizona. Yeah. And if you think about what Arizona is, this is a real shift.
*  Growth is an underpinning of Arizona's economy and identity. And the state's been able to attract
*  people from all over the country with the promise really of, you know, bounty in the desert. And that
*  could begin to change. But if you go to Phoenix and the expanding suburbs around Phoenix, people
*  don't seem especially worried about it. They still seem pretty bullish about the future. Give me your
*  sense to how do you describe Buckeye to people who don't live there? You don't have to shovel sunshine
*  ever. And so take, for example, a fast growing town city, really just west of downtown Phoenix
*  called Buckeye. It's not unlike a place you could see anywhere in the country. There's
*  strip malls and houses. You wouldn't know you were in a desert to drive through Buckeye.
*  Buckeye grew up very fast in the past 20 years from like 8,000 people to over 100,000 people right now.
*  I spoke to the head of Buckeye's water department, Terry Lowe and other city officials. They've
*  already been told at the start of this year that there isn't enough groundwater beneath Buckeye to
*  support new development. That's not a secret at this point, but it doesn't seem to be having any drag
*  on sort of optimism in the town. And if you want to go see the ocean, it's only about four or five
*  hours away. And if you want to go skiing, you can go. And if you can ski, you can be in the desert in
*  one minute and skiing in the next and be back in the same day. Right. And the result is there's still
*  talking about how to grow. If you haven't lived here, you haven't done a little bit of research,
*  you would think that water is not available and is a challenge and we're going to run out or that
*  type of thing. We're not in any way, shape or form close to any of that. So their debate is not whether
*  to grow or whether they can maintain their quality of life. It's where to find the water to support
*  that growth. There's water here. It's just, it's not how much water it's, it's how much do you want
*  to pay for it? Because the easy water was spoken for a hundred years ago and now it's the more
*  challenging water that that's going to have a cost associated with it. Okay. So Arizona is in this
*  water crisis. Much of the state has been told they can't grow anymore. And yet these people in these
*  suburbs are still talking about growth. How do they reconcile that? Well, remember they've been
*  told there's not enough groundwater, but they haven't been told they can't grow. The state has
*  said the groundwater it has now in many key areas can't support more growth, but if they can find
*  new sources of water, there's nothing stopping them from growing. And what I found from talking
*  to people in the Phoenix area is they think they can do that. They feel like this is a problem
*  that they can solve. But I mean, how do you find more water? Well, that's the question. And knowing
*  that communities all over Arizona will need more water. Last year, Arizona, realizing the trouble
*  it was facing, set up a new program where they set aside money, a lot of money, a billion dollars,
*  and hired new staff, try to answer that question, where to find the water. And the term of art is
*  water augmentation. And there's one idea they're looking at. It's desalination.
*  Desalination. Okay, desalination sounds like you take salt out of ocean water.
*  Very good. So obviously, the problem here is not that there's not enough water in the world. Oceans
*  cover what two thirds of the earth's surface is that there's not enough fresh drinkable water. So
*  desalination is taking the resource that we have an abundance of and turning it into the thing that's
*  scarce. And how they do that is you push that water through a membrane, it's kind of a filter
*  at really high pressure, and the filter strips out the salt, and you're left with perfectly drinkable
*  water, which in theory, if it comes from the ocean means you've got, if not an infinite supply,
*  then certainly enough water to answer the challenges in Arizona.
*  How much of an established thing is this, this desalination?
*  So this is actually widely used. There are several desalination plants in the US already,
*  many of them in California and Texas, in the Middle East, Persian Gulf countries,
*  in Israel, it's widely used. This is not a new technology. I think what's changing is as climate
*  change makes more and more places water scarce, more people are saying, wait, can that be our
*  solution as well? And now Arizona is in that camp. And in fact, the company that proposed this idea
*  to Arizona is an Israeli company called IDE Technologies, one of the largest desalination
*  operators in the world. And IDE actually went to Arizona to speak to the committee tasked with
*  finding more water, their acronym is WIFA, late last year,
*  and formally pitched this idea of providing desalinated water to Arizona.
*  Famous for its beautiful, diverse landscapes and nature, such as the Grand Canyon, and its
*  vast and ancient history, the state of Arizona is a shining star on the US border with Mexico.
*  Okay, but how would this actually work? I mean, you need ocean water, right? And Arizona is,
*  of course, not on the ocean. That's the catch. Arizona is not, in fact, on the ocean.
*  The Arizona Water Project Solution Team as a private sector critical infrastructure solution.
*  So what IDE proposed in this video presentation they made for WIFA will develop, design,
*  build, finance, is to build the desalination plants, not in Arizona, the largest in the world
*  to date, seawater desalination plant, but across the border in Mexico. The desalination plant will
*  be located at Puerto Pinasco, Sonora, Mexico, drawing seawater from the Sea of Cortez, and then
*  build a pipeline that would run 200 miles, a lot of it uphill, to deliver that desalinated water
*  from Mexico to Phoenix. Ensuring the needs and growth of the state of Arizona, as well as the
*  entire region forever. You may call it an infinite and unlimited reverse Colorado River.
*  So this is wild. They're proposing a giant pipeline to bring ocean water off of Mexico,
*  all the way up to Arizona, like this huge river flowing backwards. Instead of water flowing
*  hundreds of miles to the sea, this would be ocean water flowing hundreds of miles inland.
*  When you put it like that, it does sound a bit crazy. And even proponents acknowledge this is a
*  pretty initially outlandish seeming idea. There are so many obstacles, geographic, political,
*  economic, energy obstacles, so many things that make this seem like a pipe dream. But it's also
*  a pipe dream that really could happen. So I wanted to understand what the obstacles would be. And the
*  logical place to start was Puerto Pinasco, the city on the shore of the Gulf of California,
*  sometimes called the Sea of Cortez, where this desalination plant would get built. It's a city
*  of about 60,000 people. It's an hour south of the border between Arizona and Mexico.
*  And from the ocean, it's beautiful. It's got luxury villas and high rise condos on a really
*  attractive beach. It's a tourism mecca for people from Arizona and from Mexico.
*  It's a fishing economy. You can see people going out in boats. The interior of the city is quite
*  different. There's significant poverty rates. A lot of the roads are unpaved. A lot of the buildings
*  aren't painted. And so when I got there, what I wanted to understand was how officials in
*  Puerto Pinasco viewed this idea to build a desal plant for Arizona.
*  So the idea is that IDE would acquire land in Puerto Pinasco. And as part of the deal,
*  it would provide some desalinated water to Puerto Pinasco and other nearby cities,
*  though it hasn't said how much water it would provide or how much it would charge,
*  or even whether it's a price that local residents could afford to pay.
*  So IDE told Arizona lawmakers in December that their plan was to build the largest desal plant
*  anywhere in the world here in Puerto Pinasco, pipe the water to Arizona, and also provide some water
*  to Puerto Pinasco. Have you talked to them? We have no knowledge.
*  And the thing to remember is Puerto Pinasco and the area around it is also desert. So drinking
*  water is a real challenge there too. So I wanted to ask officials if they thought this would be a
*  good thing, because of course the plan can't go forward if Mexican officials reject it.
*  If they called you, what would you say? Is it a good idea?
*  We're always going to be open to this subject.
*  And to my surprise, these local officials said they think desalination is actually a really
*  important and probably necessary thing for Puerto Pinasco because of their water shortages,
*  but with some caveats. And the main one is cost. How much could you afford to pay?
*  They stressed that there's only so much local residents can pay for this water.
*  Puerto Pinasco, again, is not a rich place. If the desal plant is four times as much,
*  and this was five times or six times or 10 times, could you afford it?
*  No, it's too much. It's too high.
*  But these officials were also worried about the environmental costs of doing this.
*  So we have a big problem because the highest concentration of salt is going to provoke some
*  damage. So again, desalination involves pushing salt water through a membrane, filtering out the
*  salt, and then taking that sort of slurry, that highly saline brine, and doing something with it.
*  In some parts of the world, they'll inject it deep underground, where in theory it won't be a
*  concern. But in this case, IDES said they would put that salty brine back into the Gulf of California.
*  But just releasing the brine back into the water, it's not a good idea.
*  So what do you think will happen? You've got this real problem. The answers are all difficult or
*  expensive. If we meet again five years from now, what do you think we'll look back on and see that
*  you did? In five years, we're going to be having to desalinate more. Little by little.
*  That's just going to become more expensive to live in Puerto Pinasco.
*  So their position seemed to be that whether it's this particular deal with IDE and Arizona or not,
*  desalination is part of the future in Puerto Pinasco, which means this issue of what to do
*  with that waste brine is one they have to think about a solution for. Hi. So it's sort of a lovely
*  spot, isn't it? Yeah. It's so beautiful. So I went to talk to a local environmentalist, a woman named
*  Nelida Barajas Acosta, who helped lay it out for me. I mean, just from looking at it, it's an open
*  area. They wouldn't have to tear down any buildings. They wouldn't have to throw anyone out of their
*  homes right by the water. It seems good, no? Well, think about this. Not because you are seeing an
*  empty land. That means that it is empty. You know, they are biodiversity there. And after we got to
*  her office, I asked her to walk me through what the environmental impacts would be from this idea.
*  And she was very clear they would not be good. So when IDE discusses this, they've been very
*  clear that there will be no negative impact from the brine. Is that accurate? No. No. So by changing
*  the density, you know, the salinity of the water in this area, this is like the air pollution.
*  Your flume, it is not only in the place you are releasing, but it will be dispersed in all around
*  the Sea of Cortez. And the effects on fisheries will be dramatic. The point she's making is that
*  it's not the salt itself. It's the concentration of the salt that poses a threat to sea life.
*  And in the open ocean, when desalination plants are built, say, on the coast of California,
*  that salty brine, that intense waste brine is broadly dispersed because of the currents and
*  just the open space. But this is different because you're talking about dispersing that same
*  concentrated brine into a really narrow gulf where it doesn't have the same capacity to be
*  sort of wildly dispersed quickly. So the concern that she has, and I heard from others, is that
*  though desalination plants like this can work and don't have to be a significant hazard on the open
*  ocean, in this context, in this kind of a narrow gulf, it could be a real problem for the fish and
*  wildlife that live there. Of course we need water, but let me tell you something. I traveled this
*  afternoon, traveled to Phoenix, and what I see is a society that do not recognize how important the
*  water is and just want more water for more things that are not essential. By walking by downtown,
*  it looks like California, swimming pools and amazing gardens. This is not right. We are living
*  in the desert and you have to be so responsible on being a desert habitat that that changed you
*  forever. And her larger point is rather than trying to find new sources of water that could
*  potentially hurt the environment, why not focus instead on conserving water and living more within
*  the confines of a desert. Now, despite the really serious environmental concerns, at the end of my
*  time in Puerto Poneasco, it seemed to me like this idea wasn't obviously a non-starter. It would be
*  a lot to get everyone to say yes who has to say yes, but I left with the idea that it could happen.
*  Okay, so that would be the situation around the source of new water for Arizona. And of course,
*  even if Mexico decides they're down for this deal, you still have to bring the water there
*  to Arizona, as we're discussing. So how's that going to go? Here's one of the biggest problems.
*  You've got to run a 200-mile pipeline through some of the most ecologically important and
*  unique landscape in the area and then the towns nearby. A consultant for IDE told state officials
*  that the pipeline would require a 175-foot wide corridor and the transmission line to power the
*  project would also require a 150-foot right-of-way corridor. So we're talking about a significant
*  amount of land that this pipeline would take up. So I wanted to understand what the impact would be.
*  So I drove the path it would take and the first place you come to once you cross the border into
*  Arizona is the Oregon Pipe Cactus National Monument, which is a UNESCO site and it's
*  federal land preserved for its natural significance. And people don't understand when they say,
*  oh, it's just a desert, just a desert. Well, it's not very lush desert. Yeah, yes. I spent time there
*  with two local environmentalists, Michee Lozano and Lorraine Eiler, and they took me around this
*  really indescribably beautiful and rich landscape. What does it look like, Chris?
*  Well, I'll say welcome to Keto Keto. Thank you. I had never even heard of it. I'm so glad we're here.
*  It's filled with these gigantic cactuses, the namesake Oregon Pipe Cactuses and Saguaro Cactuses.
*  They tower over the landscape. They're almost like cartoons, vaguely humanoid,
*  gigantic cactuses. And then there's the color, right? In addition to the cactuses,
*  every plant seemed to be flowering at the same time. And it was unbelievable the array of like
*  bright reds and yellows and oranges. It was the exact opposite of what I thought the desert
*  would be. And there was also not an inch of open space. Everything was packed tightly together.
*  So that could be one of the biggest challenges facing the project, what it would cost in terms
*  of carving a path, the width of multiple freeways through this landscape. And then in addition to
*  the impact on the land and the wildlife, there's also the impact on the Native Americans who have
*  roots in this area, the Tohono O'odham people. My great great grandparents are buried there
*  and other relatives, which was at one time a huge community. And so yes, it has a lot of
*  significance to us. It's a place where we have still have our ceremonies.
*  We hold it in very high esteem. You know, we consider it a sacred place. Even after the
*  national parks have taken it over, we still go there for religious purposes. And I should say,
*  IDE said in their presentation to Arizona officials that they would go around the wildlife
*  areas and minimize the impact. It's not clear to me from being there how that would work. It seems
*  like the only way to run this pipeline to transport water to Phoenix is to cut a really significant
*  hole through this national monument. Right. So it's an open question whether I guess,
*  you know, the federal government will allow what sounds like would be a significant consequence to
*  this national monument. Yeah. And then as you follow the path of the proposed pipeline
*  north beyond the national monument, there are communities that would almost certainly be
*  impacted. Anything you guys recommend I try and see while I'm in town? Somewhere to eat. Where would
*  you be? First, I'm sure you go early. Right. I went to one town called Ajo, which is a
*  beautiful little community in the desert with small homes and a beautiful laid out garden
*  in the middle of town. It's really a jewel of a place. The pipeline would either go through or
*  skirt this town. It's unclear what the effect would be. But when you talk to community advocates
*  about it, they're worried. I talked to Aaron Cooper. He's the head of the International
*  Sonoran Desert Alliance and advocacy group. And he was concerned. But the history, there's a history
*  of eviction in this community. There's a history of disenfranchisement. He was referring to Ajo's
*  history as a mining town, a town that really exists for the purpose of mining copper and how
*  people who live in Ajo have been pushed around at times and had their land confiscated to suit the
*  whims of big companies. So if the company were to try to take this land for the right of way,
*  if you're on a domain through the county, there would be a history that it was playing into.
*  Yes, like sort of a painful history. Yeah. It's hard to say if those fears would come true. Maybe
*  the pipeline could go around Ajo. But what does seem clear is the pipeline might not be welcomed
*  with open arms in the places it would pass through. And that could represent another obstacle that
*  Arizona has to think about when it's deciding what to do with this idea. Right. Okay. But
*  let's assume for the sake of argument that the pipeline clears those hurdles and it gets built.
*  For most of the people in Arizona who are concentrated around Phoenix, is there just
*  pure upside? Well, we come now to the main problem for people in Arizona, which is cost. Even if this
*  desalination plant and pipeline can get built, the question then is what does it mean for a state
*  where an affordable cost of living is a big part of the draw? A lot of people who moved to Arizona
*  come from places like California or New York, and maybe they're fleeing a high cost of living.
*  So all of a sudden you've got a situation where the cost of water is going up a lot.
*  Some estimates are the price of water could be as much as 10 times higher. So a big increase
*  to the cost of living in Arizona. At this point, you're looking at a financial burden,
*  which raises the question of if water is available, but for some people too expensive,
*  what would that mean for growth? How would that affect the appeal of Arizona as this sort of
*  affordable paradise in the sun? Okay. So this is pretty hard, right? There are upsides, but also
*  some pretty serious downsides to this thing. So how does this decision get made? Like who decides
*  for the state of Arizona, whether they want to go for it? Well, it turns out that decision falls
*  really on the shoulders of one person. So I found that guy and asked him what he thought.
*  After the break, that guy.
*  So Chris, you said that there's really one guy at the heart of this decision about whether Arizona
*  moves forward with this plan. Tell me how he's thinking about this. So this person is Chuck
*  Podolak and he's the head of WIFA, the water infrastructure finance authority. That's the
*  body that was given a billion dollars to help Arizona find and get new water. And he's not
*  deciding for Mexico, if this is a good deal for Mexico, he's not deciding for the US government
*  whether or not there should be a pipeline that's allowed to cross the border, go through federal
*  land. His job is to figure out whether this deal is good for Arizona and then decide along with
*  the board members at WIFA, if Arizona should spend money on this. Should we set up here? Is
*  this the right spot? And he invited me to his office to talk about how he's trying to decide
*  if this project is the right way or one of the right ways to augment and find new water for the
*  state. To simplify it, it does seem as though WIFA as an agency and you as the director have
*  enormous responsibility here. You're authorized to spend a huge amount of money and the stakes
*  are so high. Is it daunting? Is it a burden? Is it exciting? What's your state of mind
*  building this process of deciding how to augment Arizona's water supply?
*  Yeah, I think it is a bit daunting. And we walked through some of the challenges and how he's
*  looking at them. WIFA only works if people are willing to pay. His assessment seems to revolve
*  around some of the challenges we talked about and primarily around the cost. To make a large project
*  like that, you have to have political buy-in. That's not a decision that's only... And does
*  he seem to be taking into consideration the environmental concerns both in Mexico and along
*  the route the pipeline would take? He's not as much taking into account the environmental concerns
*  both in Mexico and Arizona. It's not really his job, but those potential environmental costs could
*  play a role in Mexico and in DC's calculation. It would be irresponsible for me to bring to the
*  board a recommendation for a project that we didn't feel comfortable had the political
*  stability that had the buy-in the long term. And that means benefits on both sides of the border.
*  So for him to back the plan, he said he needs to feel like it can get approval from both countries,
*  but he sounded more confident than you might think. What might you recommend is like the way
*  to think about how crazy this is? Crazy so it will never happen or like crazy, but that's not
*  really a barrier. It will seem crazy and ambitious until it's complete.
*  And that's our history in Arizona. You really put this idea in the broader context of
*  Arizona and made the point that if you look throughout Arizona's history, the state has been
*  built on this constant progression of water projects that when they first get proposed,
*  sound insane until they get built. We have an artificial river that runs uphill from Lake
*  Havasu to Tucson, several hundred miles. That is a crazy audacious idea, but it's done and now
*  it's we barely give it a second thought. And he mentioned the classic example, the sort of
*  foundation of modern Arizona is something called the Central Arizona Project. It's an aqueduct that
*  carries water from the Colorado River to Phoenix, and it's the source of Phoenix's amazing growth.
*  His point was this isn't the first time Arizona has faced a situation where they need more water
*  and they're looking at seemingly crazy ideas, but when you get down to it, they're not impossible
*  ideas. They're very expensive. They require a lot of coordination, a lot of money, possibly
*  environmental problems in some places. But the idea is if the alternative is Arizona doesn't grow,
*  well, maybe it's worth putting in that money. There's not a body or person who says we need
*  to grow more or less. There's people wanting to come to Arizona. There's a lot of reasons why
*  people come to Arizona. It's an attractive place to do business. It's an attractive place to live.
*  You get the feeling talking to Chuck that he sees Arizona as a place where obstacles,
*  even big obstacles like water can be overcome if you're just willing to think big enough.
*  And so it's just like this sort of foundational optimism that allows the West to persevere in the
*  face of a really hostile climate that's only becoming more hostile. And so to his mind,
*  this latest idea for a diesel pipeline project was just one more iteration of that ideal
*  that keeps driving the American West.
*  We don't have the luxury of looking at Arizona from the outside and saying, gee, that's really
*  rough. Like we have to say, yes, it is. It's hard, but what are we going to do next? How are we going
*  to deliver water? How are we going to continue to serve customers and citizens of the state?
*  These are tough issues. There's no clear way out. It's going to be expensive. It's going to be hard,
*  but we can't throw our hands up and just say it's too hard. We have to figure out a way.
*  He's basically saying we've always done this and we're going to do it again. We've bent the
*  environment to our will, all in service of growth. But of course, to keep growing and growing into
*  infinity, even if we technically can, raises the question of whether they should. Right? Like,
*  does he think about that question? Not can we build it, but should we?
*  You know, it's a great question. And I asked him that.
*  What's your response to someone who says Arizona, you shouldn't have built that much. Are they wrong?
*  I would say we're not ignorant. We're just up for the challenge. It's not that we don't know
*  it's dry. It's not that we don't know we've got challenges. It's that we have no option but to
*  figure it out. He's basically saying the state is doing this. We're not engaging on this question
*  of top down, deciding whether to stop growing or not. We're adapting. We're figuring it out.
*  And that's the same sentiment I heard from other officials in Arizona too. So what that means is
*  the decision about whether and when Arizona stops growing is left to people voting with their feet,
*  considering the cost of water and deciding whether to move to Arizona or not. And so far,
*  that demand isn't going away. And the thing that grabs me with this pipeline idea is that, yes,
*  on the one hand, it's a perfect continuation of that history of Arizona, that ethos of Arizona.
*  On the other hand, in the face of climate change, it's maybe appropriate to at least ask, well,
*  for how long can you keep on building your way and engineering your way out of reality?
*  So in the short term, if this pipeline is built, it means that the water will flow,
*  growth will continue despite the costs, environmental and otherwise. And if you can afford it,
*  you can come, right? So again, a huge water infrastructure project is moving the goalposts
*  of what's possible and forestalling really an existential reckoning about whether more and more
*  people should continue coming to live in a desert. That's right. And that's why Arizona is really at
*  the forefront of dealing with this groundwater crisis. And they're trying to engineer their way
*  out of it. And in a sense, that's the history of humanity inhabiting the earth and extreme areas
*  in the earth and building their way around those limits and those constraints. That's sort of
*  what we do. The question here is, can we do it forever? And will climate change impose some sort
*  of new limit? That means you've got to shift away from building your way out of those problems
*  and instead say, well, maybe there's some areas where it doesn't make sense to keep on building.
*  So bottom line, is this going to happen?
*  You know, I'd take Chuck at his word. He said that probably at some point, some version of this plan
*  will happen. Some version of getting desalinated water from Mexico is likely because that demand
*  for now in Arizona isn't going away. And for the moment, there's no other formal options that have
*  been presented. There's a saying in water circles that water flows uphill to money. And this would
*  be one more case of water flowing uphill to money. So it wouldn't surprise me if some version happens.
*  But what does it look like? What does it cost? Who suffers? Will it work? And for how long?
*  Chris, thank you.
*  Thanks, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. On Thursday, a fire in a building in Johannesburg,
*  South Africa killed at least 74 people, including at least 12 children, and injured dozens more.
*  Officials said the fire occurred in a five-story building that was known to be a popular site
*  for squatters in a city plagued by a severe lack of affordable housing.
*  The fire was one of the deadliest in South Africa's history.
*  And in an unusual move, Justice Clarence Thomas included a statement in his annual financial
*  disclosure form defending luxury trips, flights on a private jet, and a real estate transaction
*  with Texas billionaire Harlan Crowe. Thomas wrote that trips on non-commercial flights
*  had been advised due to increased security risk following the leak of the draft opinion
*  in the Dobbs case. He also argued that his past filings that had omitted luxury trips with Crowe
*  were proper, writing that he had, quote,
*  adhered to the then existing judicial regulations. He did, however, acknowledge errors in past reports
*  in which he failed to disclose personal bank accounts and his wife's life insurance,
*  writing that the omission was inadvertent.
