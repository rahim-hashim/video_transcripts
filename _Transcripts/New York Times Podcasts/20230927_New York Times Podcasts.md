# Did Hollywood Writers Get Their Happy Ending?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIpy8IElU38)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  After 148 days on strike, one of the longest in history, writers for movies and televisions
*  will return to work today with a deal in hand that amounts to a major win for organized
*  labor in Hollywood.
*  Today, my colleague John Koblin on why the studio is acquiesced and what the deal means
*  for the future of American entertainment.
*  It's Wednesday, September 27th.
*  So John, we're talking on Tuesday afternoon, and by all accounts, the writers and the studios
*  have reached a deal on a contract after the writers striking for months and months.
*  And we wanted to come to you to talk about this and how this deal came about, what's
*  actually in it.
*  But right off the bat, top line, highest level, what's your read on all of this?
*  Who's really the winner here?
*  It looks like at this moment that the writers really prevailed.
*  It's funny, when the writers last went on strike, which was 15 years ago, 100 days'
*  strike, so more than three months, after that strike had ended, after they reached that
*  tentative agreement, the Guild leader sent out an email that said something like, you
*  know, we didn't get everything we wanted, and we've sacrificed countless hours during
*  the struggle, but we did well.
*  This time, when they announced the tentative agreement, which was on Sunday night,
*  WTA! WTA! WTA!
*  We just found out there's a tentative agreement on the writers strike, it might be over.
*  Woo!
*  I mean, it was like vibrating with excitement, that message.
*  It makes me very excited because I think we might have actually saved the film and TV
*  industry with this strike.
*  They came out and said, we say this with great pride, that this deal is exceptional.
*  There has been so much at stake, and they would not settle for a subpar deal because
*  we're not settling over here.
*  So there is a perception within the Writers Guild that they got a big W, like capital
*  W, like capital V for victory.
*  Capital V for victory for the writers.
*  And we talked about this before, John, on the show, but just remind us what it was that
*  they had wanted.
*  The strike has been framed in pretty epic terms, right?
*  A showdown over what it really means to be a creative force in the era of the streaming
*  revolution, when the technology and the economics of the entire industry have been changing
*  before our eyes.
*  But nitty gritty, what were the writers asking for?
*  Epic is one way to describe it.
*  Another way they described it was, literally, this is existential.
*  This moment is existential.
*  We are fighting for our survival.
*  But by far the biggest issue was compensation.
*  We talked about this last time, but let's go back 20, 30 years ago, back to the network
*  TV days.
*  If you created an ER, a big, big hit, hundreds of episodes, even if it ends after, say, nine
*  or 10 seasons, it's going to live forever.
*  And the reason is it's going to go into syndication.
*  It's going to go into cable.
*  It's going to go into repeats, essentially.
*  And every time that would air on, say, a cable network like TBS, if you were a writer of
*  an episode, you got to check.
*  So that's just money in the bank.
*  You bring that back.
*  Kind of like a royalty.
*  Kind of like a royalty.
*  Exactly.
*  So now let's look at the streaming era.
*  If you create a hit show on Netflix, let's say Bridgerton, you get a nice amount of money
*  up front after they greenlit the show.
*  That's great.
*  But then even if you have a mega success, like a Bridgerton, if you think about a place
*  like Netflix, there's no syndication.
*  It just stays on Netflix.
*  They're not licensing it to a cable network.
*  Right.
*  So the money you used to get after a show is a huge hit, that doesn't really exist in
*  the same way.
*  So writers are essentially asking for more money in several different places from the
*  studios.
*  OK.
*  So more pay was really the number one issue.
*  What else were they asking for?
*  They also wanted a little bit of transparency.
*  Again, if we look back 20, 25 years ago, we know how many people watched that episode
*  of Friends or Seinfeld or ER.
*  Nielsen used to tell you how many millions of viewers are watching it.
*  We do not have that same level of transparency from an Amazon or Hulu or a Netflix.
*  Though presumably they know it, given the fact that it's clicks, right?
*  For sure.
*  They definitely know it.
*  And like they'll give us something these days where here's our top 10 in the United
*  States today.
*  But the writers, they wanted to know that if a show is a mega hit, like we want to profit
*  from that too.
*  That's the way the old system used to work.
*  And the other interesting thing they were asking for was about AI.
*  And what exactly were they asking for when it comes to AI?
*  I mean, there were several different things, but let's focus on one, which is if I'm a
*  studio executive and I have a stack of Nora Ephron scripts, she wrote, You've Got Mail,
*  for instance.
*  Famous writer.
*  Among many other great movies.
*  I take those scripts, I feed them into the AI robot and I say, Give me a Nora Ephron
*  style of a rom-com, of a romantic comedy.
*  That is the writer's worst nightmare because they don't want a robot to be the accredited
*  writer of a movie.
*  So no good, no bueno.
*  I mean, I don't want a robot to be an accredited writer of my article.
*  I mean, this is like kind of scary, right?
*  Robots should not be replacing writers.
*  That feels reasonable to me.
*  I feel tribal about this.
*  Okay, so that's the basic list of things the writers were asking for.
*  And now, Tuesday afternoon, we are about to live into the answer of what they got.
*  What do we know about what they did get?
*  So it's going to become more clear in the coming days.
*  But we know that they got a lot.
*  We know they got much of what they asked for.
*  And you know, we were talking about their statement vibrating with joy earlier.
*  The studio's only statement was the Writers Guild of America, the Writers Union, and the
*  Studio Alliance have reached a tentative agreement.
*  Period.
*  Full stop.
*  That's it.
*  It was pretty muted.
*  So they gave up a lot more than they were anticipating five months ago.
*  And the union, they said they made meaningful gains and protections for every writer in
*  every sector of the union membership.
*  Translation, we got a lot of what we wanted.
*  Yes.
*  Okay, so the studios checked all the boxes that they put out there.
*  How do you explain such a victory for the writers?
*  Because I mean, for months, it just didn't seem like the two sides were even talking.
*  Like the story was the picket line.
*  So what got everyone back to the negotiating table and ultimately to a deal?
*  So there were a few key moments.
*  So after the writers go on strike, that's early May, all of a sudden, the studios have
*  two other contracts to deal with Hollywood directors, and then the actors.
*  The studios are not worried about the directors or actors.
*  Why?
*  The writers have gone on strike many times over the decades.
*  They went on strike as we discussed 15 years ago.
*  Before that, they did it in 1988.
*  Directors and actors, they just have not gone on strike nearly as many times.
*  The last time the actors went on strike was over four decades ago.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Okay.
*  So just typically, there's a big difference between these groups.
*  Completely.
*  So the studios negotiate with the directors, get a deal done really quickly.
*  The directors call the deal historic.
*  So one down, one to go.
*  And then sure enough, by mid-July, the actors do go on strike.
*  And it kind of stuns everybody.
*  Producers, agents, Hollywood observers, but it also surprises the studio executives.
*  Okay, so the actors go on strike.
*  But what does that have to do with the writers?
*  So by the time the actors go on strike, the writers have been on strike for two and a
*  half months.
*  It's mid-July.
*  It's getting hot outside.
*  It's hot in LA.
*  It's hot in New York.
*  They've been walking these picket lines for two and a half months.
*  When the actors surprise strike, because everybody was caught off guard, there's suddenly wind
*  at the backs of the writers.
*  They're not so lonely on those picket lines anymore.
*  It's this huge moment of solidarity.
*  The actors and writers, they hadn't been on strike at the same time.
*  Going back generations, it was since 1960.
*  So it had been years.
*  And that is what shut down Hollywood, because all of a sudden, cameras can't roll anymore.
*  You can't work without actors.
*  It got the attention of everybody.
*  Right now, Hollywood is at a total standstill, right?
*  No one can work, including, by the way, John, my own brother who works in the film industry.
*  He takes photographs on film sets.
*  Hasn't worked since the actors went on strike.
*  Really tough.
*  What do the studios do at that point?
*  So, if you're the studio executives, this is no longer one irritating union out there.
*  Everything is completely stopped.
*  So you have to deal with somebody.
*  And so the studios said, okay, you know what?
*  Writers, we haven't talked to them in months.
*  They've been out for a while.
*  We're going to turn to them first.
*  And what happened?
*  So effectively, very little happens.
*  There were negotiations, but it was just very on again, off again throughout the month
*  of August.
*  You know, there was something about the month of August.
*  Everybody's on vacation.
*  You know, it's like, okay, of course there are a couple strikes happening.
*  Big deal.
*  Right.
*  The temperature changed the second we hit the second week of September.
*  All of a sudden, everybody's rubbing the sleep out of their eyes from the summer.
*  And then they looked around and they said, why isn't anybody working?
*  What's happening?
*  And also the studios just frankly began to look at their balance sheets.
*  Warner Brothers Discovery, big entertainment company, they had to go out and announce that
*  our adjusted earnings because of the strikes are going to take a hit of anywhere between
*  300 and 500 million dollars this year.
*  That's the studio behind Barbie.
*  Right.
*  Like the hit, huge performance.
*  And even with that performance, Warner Brothers Discovery is starting to sweat this a little
*  bit.
*  Wow.
*  So I'd like if this studio is struggling, then every studio is struggling.
*  It's not just the studios.
*  The writers, they've been out of work now for four or five months.
*  It's a long time not to get a paycheck.
*  And by the time we're at September, we noticed that some of the biggest name writers in Hollywood,
*  Kenya Barris, he created Blackish on ABC.
*  Noah Hawley, he created the TV show Fargo for FX.
*  Ryan Murphy, he created American Horror Story.
*  They started getting kind of restless.
*  They were saying, what's going on?
*  Why aren't we even in a room?
*  We haven't talked to the studios in weeks by this point.
*  And they were trying to meet with Guild leadership just to ask, like, what's going on?
*  So they're saying, guys, it's been a while.
*  Hurry up.
*  What's happening?
*  Exactly.
*  And we're still reporting out what exactly happened there.
*  But here's what we do know.
*  The union and the studios then did agree to meet.
*  And that meeting happened last week.
*  And do we know anything about what those meetings were like?
*  Like any details from inside the room?
*  So here's what we do know.
*  Studio executives, top executives, were suddenly sitting in the room.
*  Disney chief executive Bob Iger, Warner Brothers Discovery chief executive David Zaslav, Netflix
*  co-chief executive Ted Sarandos, and a huge executive at NBC Universal, Donna Langley.
*  They were sitting in the room.
*  That had not happened.
*  And what's the significance of that, John?
*  What did it mean that they were there?
*  It meant we mean business now.
*  Because it's like, whoa, if they're showing up, they want to get this deal done.
*  It's close.
*  It's close.
*  And sure enough, within five days over the weekend, they reach a tentative agreement.
*  And how they did it's pretty simple.
*  They went down the writers list of ass and basically hit on all of them.
*  And most significantly, they open up their wallet and they open up their wallet in a
*  way that they weren't willing to do four or five months ago.
*  So basically, the studios paid up.
*  Exactly.
*  So is the way to think about this, John, that the writers kind of just waited the studios
*  out?
*  Like that the studios couldn't deal with the math of the strike any longer?
*  Turns out they also have finance departments and accountants who were saying, we got to
*  get something on the table here.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, the studios were hurting.
*  I mean, they need productions to be happening because they need new shows.
*  They need new movies.
*  They need to put these things on their streaming services.
*  I mean, already we've seen significant fallout from the strikes.
*  Perspective blockbuster movies that were scheduled for this year have been moved to next year.
*  TV series that were scheduled for this year have been moved to next year.
*  So they had to make this deal.
*  They did have to open up their wallet.
*  But just because they got this deal, it does not mean that production is going to start
*  again immediately.
*  Remember, the studios still have another contract to negotiate.
*  The actors are still on strike.
*  You had two walkouts and you've got to solve one before you solve the other.
*  So post-strike, the writers got a lot of what they asked for.
*  The reality is the cost won't just be borne by the studios.
*  There might be a cost to the writers too.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So John, before the break, you said we're about to find out how things are going to
*  change under this new contract.
*  What type of landscape that is going to set up.
*  And you said that it won't necessarily be without cost to the writers.
*  At the highest level, how should we think about that change?
*  So the writers made a lot of gains.
*  They're going to get paid a lot more.
*  But this also very likely is going to mean on the other side, next year, the year after
*  that and the year after that, fewer TV shows.
*  So tell me about that.
*  Why would necessarily that mean fewer shows?
*  So let's use Netflix as an example.
*  Netflix's content budget last year was around $17 billion.
*  It's like a small country.
*  And this year, Netflix's budget is around $17 billion.
*  Next year, it'll be around $17 billion.
*  You see a trend?
*  And if you're going to pay the writers more money and you're eventually going to pay
*  the actors more money because they will get a deal at some point, the strike is going
*  to end. Well, something's got to give.
*  Right. Then you don't have as much money to invest in the same number of TV shows or
*  movies.
*  OK, same pie.
*  But if each show costs more to make, you know, each slice, then they're going to be
*  fewer slices of the pie to go around.
*  Exactly. OK, so that's the downside for the writers.
*  Fewer shows to work on.
*  Do they understand that?
*  Like, is that something they've taken on board?
*  I don't quite know yet.
*  I haven't talked to them yet.
*  But here is what we do know.
*  Going into this labor dispute, writers were calling this moment existential.
*  They said they were fighting for their own survival.
*  And with this new contract, screenwriting is still a profession.
*  The writers are still around.
*  They still exist.
*  But are they fully aware of what is a very likely outcome that there are just going to
*  be fewer shows? I don't quite know yet.
*  So what does this new contract mean for me, for Jane Consumer?
*  Would you believe you may have to pay more money?
*  I know it's shocking.
*  So basically, the economics of streaming, you know, it's been difficult for most media
*  companies over the last decade.
*  Peacock, Paramount Plus, Hulu, these are streaming services that lose a lot of money
*  and still do.
*  So those days where you are paying $7, $6 a month and you're getting endless streaming
*  content, you pay a lot more than that now and you will likely pay more in the future.
*  So kind of like Uber, I had the app on my phone forever.
*  It was super cheap. I used it all the time.
*  Suddenly, kablam, it became really expensive.
*  I stopped using it.
*  Exactly. And to make the balance sheets work, you keep raising prices.
*  And now even more so in the wake of these strikes, the studios are probably going to
*  have to at some point, some point the next year, raise prices again.
*  So you're saying that the studios may just pass the cost of this new contract onto us?
*  That's what some financial analysts are already saying.
*  And the other thing is these strikes have lasted for months.
*  So at least in the short and midterm, going into next year, there are going to be fewer
*  TV shows. There are going to be fewer movies.
*  You will find yourself on your couch at some point, clicking on all these streaming
*  services, saying to yourself, where is something new to watch?
*  Like, I want no.
*  Give me more choices. I want more choices.
*  And you won't quite have that.
*  But, John, what if I don't want quite so many choices?
*  I mean, maybe there's an element of silver lining in this.
*  I mean, there were so many shows, right?
*  Should there be that many shows?
*  Totally. I mean, this is something if you put truth serum in the arm of creative
*  executives, they will say fewer shows.
*  That is great because then we as creative executives have time to focus on quality.
*  We have time to really get in there and help writers with their script and to help
*  with the cuts of a show.
*  So, yes, I think long term for consumer, it will be good because, no, we did not need
*  600 scripted shows in the United States every single year.
*  I only watch a fraction of them.
*  It's hard to watch that much television, even with all the time in the world.
*  Perhaps they can focus on the good ones.
*  That's right.
*  So, John, it strikes me that this is a moment where the streaming industry has just kind
*  of lived through its heady, young, maybe teenage days, right?
*  And now we are living into an era in which it has to grow up.
*  And in some ways, we as consumers also have to grow up along with it, which what I mean
*  by that is we have to realize that these shows do cost a lot of money to make and that
*  we're going to have to come to terms with the fact that we're going to have fewer of
*  them and we're going to have to pay more money to get them.
*  Yeah, I guess maybe we're in sort of our adolescent moment for these streaming services.
*  And as a result, it's a little tricky.
*  It's a little difficult.
*  It's a little tough.
*  And it's going to be tough for us because the whole promise of streaming was this was
*  all going to be so much cheaper.
*  Right.
*  This is going to be so much cheaper than cable.
*  Let's cut the cord.
*  Subscribe to a few streaming services and we're good to go.
*  But the prices have been creeping up and there is talk in the entertainment industry
*  now of why don't we bundle a few of these streaming services together?
*  Max, meet Peacock, meet Paramount Plus.
*  So all of a sudden you're starting to recreate cable in some way.
*  So the cost in the end, it's probably going to approach or maybe even match at some
*  point what we used to pay for for cable.
*  So, John, thinking about this moment we're in right now with streaming and at the same
*  time, what's emerging from this new contract, it's almost like we're going back in a way
*  to that old model of TV and film, you know, the pre streaming version where big entertainment
*  companies made fewer shows.
*  We paid more, but also the writers got paid more.
*  I mean, the studios would love to go back 20 years ago.
*  The writers would love to go back 20 years ago, but that world is just gone now.
*  Streaming has changed everything.
*  This technological change has shifted everything.
*  But in the case of the writer, you know, you're never going to make friends money again.
*  But if you do create a big hit on Netflix, if you do create, say, a Bridgerton with this
*  contract, it does set you up a little bit better.
*  You're going to get more money than you did, say, four or five years ago.
*  But what's kind of interesting on the other side of the strike, the studios are over here,
*  the writers are over there, and they're both kind of just stumbling their way into the
*  future trying to make this work.
*  Streaming has changed everything.
*  It's upended everything.
*  And both the studios and the writers are just trying to figure out a way to make it to the
*  other side when all of a sudden streaming is all that exists and cable television really
*  doesn't exist or network TV doesn't really exist.
*  That they both still are around.
*  Writers are still writing and the studios are still making new TV shows, new movies.
*  So the contract in a way is pushing our, you know, adolescent rambunctious streaming out of
*  the house. Streaming goes to college.
*  John, thank you.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  On Tuesday night, the Writers Guild of America made the details of its deal with the studios
*  public for the first time.
*  It included major concessions on how the writers are paid, including royalties for overseas
*  viewing. It also guaranteed that the studios will not use artificial intelligence to rewrite
*  original material.
*  The union's 11,500 screenwriter members are expected to approve the three year deal in a
*  vote that begins on Monday.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  The legal troubles of former President Donald Trump deepened on Tuesday when a New York judge
*  ruled against him in a civil case filed by New York State Attorney General Letitia James.
*  James had accused Trump of fraud for inflating the value of his assets and she seeks millions of
*  dollars in damages.
*  But Tuesday's ruling granted one of the biggest punishments James sought.
*  The cancellation of business certificates that allowed some of Trump's New York properties to
*  operate. That could terminate Trump's control over assets that include 40 Wall Street, a
*  family estate, a golf club in Westchester County and Trump Tower.
*  And the Federal Trade Commission and 17 states sued Amazon, setting up a long awaited
*  antitrust fight that could alter the way Americans shop online.
*  In the 172 page suit, the federal government accused the e-commerce giant of protecting a
*  monopoly over swaths of online retail by squeezing merchants and favoring its own
*  services. The suit alleges that the retailer's tactics made it impossible for its rivals to
*  compete.
*  Finally, Ukraine acknowledged that there might be some uncertainty surrounding its claim that
*  Russia's Black Sea Fleet commander was killed in a strike on Crimea.
*  Kiev said that it was, quote, clarifying whether Viktor Sokolov had in fact been killed.
*  On Tuesday, Moscow released a video purporting to show the admiral alive.
*  Today's episode was produced by Shannon Lin, Summer Tamad, Sydney Harper and Rachelle Bonja.
*  It was edited by M.J. Davis Lin with help from Michael Barbaro, contains original music by
*  Marian Lozano and Will Reed and was engineered by Chris Wood.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landsberg of Wonderly.
*  That's it for the Daily. I'm Sabrina Taveri, see you tomorrow.
