# Did Hollywood Writers Get Their Happy Ending?

*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverny-Sea, and this is The Daily.
*  After 148 days on strike, one of the longest in history, writers for movies and televisions
*  will return to work today, with a deal in hand that amounts to a major win for organized
*  labor in Hollywood.
*  Today, my colleague John Koblin, on why the studios acquiesced and what the deal means for
*  the future of American entertainment.
*  It's Wednesday, September 27.
*  So John, we're talking on Tuesday afternoon, and by all accounts, the writers and the
*  studios have reached a deal on a contract after the writers striking for months and months.
*  And we wanted to come to you to talk about this and how this deal came about, what's actually
*  in it.
*  But right off the bat, top line, highest level, what's your read on all of this?
*  Who's really the winner here?
*  It looks like at this moment that the writers really prevailed.
*  It's funny when the writers last went on strike, which was 15 years ago, 100 days strikes,
*  so more than three months.
*  After that strike had ended, after they reached that tentative agreement, the guild leader
*  sent out an email that said something like, you know, we didn't get everything we wanted,
*  and we've sacrificed countless hours during the struggle, but we did well.
*  This time, when they announced a tentative agreement, which was on Sunday night.
*  We just ran down, there's a tentative agreement from a writer's strike and my neighbor.
*  I mean, it was like vibrating with excitement, that message.
*  It makes me very excited because I think we might have actually saved the film and see the
*  industry with this strike.
*  They came out and said, we say this with great pride that this deal is exceptional.
*  There has been so much at stake and they would not settle for a subpar deal because we're
*  not settling over here.
*  So there is a perception within the writers guilt that they got a big W, like capital W,
*  like capital V for victory.
*  Capital V for victory for the writers.
*  We've talked about this before, John, on the show, but just remind us what it was that
*  they had wanted.
*  I mean, you know, the strike has been framed in pretty epic terms, right?
*  A showdown over what it really means to be a creative force in the era of the streaming
*  revolution when the technology and the economics of the entire industry have been changing before
*  our eyes.
*  But nitty gritty, what were the writers asking for?
*  Dick is one way to describe it.
*  Another way they described it was literally this is existential.
*  This moment is existential.
*  We are fighting for our survival.
*  But by far the biggest issue was compensation.
*  We talked about this last time, but let's go back 20, 30 years ago, back to the network
*  TV days.
*  If you created an ER, a big, big hit, hundreds of episodes, even if it ends after say nine
*  or ten seasons, it's going to live forever.
*  And the reason is it's going to go into syndication.
*  It's going to go into cable.
*  It's going to go into repeats essentially.
*  And every time that would air on say a cable network like TBS, if you were a writer of an
*  episode, you got to check.
*  So that's just money in the bank.
*  You bring that back kind of like a royalty, kind of like a royalty.
*  Exactly.
*  So now let's look at the streaming era.
*  If you create a hit show on Netflix, let's say Bridgerton, you get a nice amount of money
*  up front after they green with the show.
*  That's great.
*  But then even if you have a mega success like a Bridgerton, if you think about a place
*  like Netflix, there's no syndication.
*  It just stays on Netflix.
*  They're not licensing it to a cable network.
*  Right.
*  So the money used to get after a show is a huge hit.
*  That doesn't really exist in the same way.
*  So writers are essentially asking for more money in several different places from the studios.
*  Okay.
*  So more pay was really the number one issue.
*  What else were they asking for?
*  They also wanted a little bit of transparency.
*  Again, if we look back 20, 25 years ago, we know how many people watched at episode of
*  friends or signfell or ER.
*  Nielsen used to tell you how many millions of viewers are watching it.
*  We do not have that same level of transparency from an Amazon or Hulu or a Netflix.
*  Though presumably they know it, given the fact that it's clicks, right?
*  For sure.
*  Definitely know it.
*  They'll give us something these days where here's our top 10 in the United States today.
*  But the writers, they wanted to know that if it shows a mega hit, we want to profit from
*  that too.
*  That's the way the old system used to work.
*  And the other interesting thing they were asking for was about AI.
*  And what exactly were they asking for when it comes to AI?
*  There were several different things, but let's focus on one, which is if I'm a studio executive
*  and I have a stack of Nora Efron scripts.
*  She wrote, you've got mail, for instance.
*  Famous writer?
*  Among many other great movies.
*  But I take those scripts, I feed them into the AI robot and I say, give me a Nora Efron
*  style of a romcom of a romantic comedy.
*  That is the writer's worst nightmare because they don't want a robot to be the accredited
*  writer of a movie.
*  So no good, no bueno.
*  I mean, I don't want a robot to be an accredited writer of my article.
*  I mean, this is like kind of scary, right?
*  Robots should not be replacing writers.
*  That feels reasonable to me.
*  I feel tribal about this.
*  Okay, so that's the basic list of things the writers were asking for.
*  And now Tuesday afternoon, we are about to live into the answer of what they got.
*  What do we know about what they did get?
*  So it's going to become more clear in the coming days, but we know that they got a lot.
*  We know they got much of what they asked for.
*  And you know, we were talking about their statement vibrating with joy earlier.
*  Exactly right.
*  The studio's only statement was the writer's guild of America, the writer's union, and
*  the studio alliance have reached a tentative agreement.
*  Period, full stop.
*  That's it.
*  It was pretty muted.
*  So they gave up a lot more than they were anticipating five months ago.
*  In the union, they said they made meaningful gains and protections for every writer in
*  every sector of the union membership.
*  Translation, we got a lot of what we wanted.
*  Yes.
*  Okay, so the studios checked all the boxes that they put out there.
*  How do you explain such a victory for the writers?
*  Because I mean, for months, it just didn't seem like the two sides were even talking.
*  Like the story was the picket line.
*  So what got everyone back to the negotiating table and ultimately to a deal?
*  So there were a few key moments.
*  So after the writers go on strike, that's early May.
*  All of a sudden, the studios have two other contracts to deal with, Hollywood directors
*  and then the actors.
*  The studios are not worried about the directors or actors.
*  Why?
*  The writers have gone on strike many times over the decades.
*  They went on strike as we discussed 15 years ago.
*  Before that, they did it in 1988.
*  Directors and actors, they just have not gone on strike nearly as many times.
*  Last time the actors went on strike was over four decades ago.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Okay.
*  So just typically, there's a big difference between these groups.
*  Completely.
*  So the studios negotiate with the directors, get a deal done really quickly.
*  The directors call the deal historic.
*  So one down, one to go.
*  And then sure enough,
*  I mid-July, the actors do go on strike and it kind of stuns everybody.
*  Producers, agents, Hollywood observers, but it also surprises the studio executives.
*  Okay.
*  So the actors go on strike.
*  But what does that have to do with the writers?
*  So by the time the actors go on strike, the writers have been on strike for two and a half
*  months.
*  It's mid-July.
*  It's getting hot outside.
*  It's hot in LA.
*  It's hot in New York.
*  Telling about the company's picket lines for two and a half months.
*  And the actors surprised strike because everybody was caught off guard.
*  They're suddenly winded the backs of the writers.
*  They're not so lonely on those picket lines anymore.
*  It's this huge moment of solidarity.
*  The actors and writers had been on strike at the same time going by generations.
*  It was since 1960, so it had been worse.
*  And that is what shut down Hollywood.
*  Because all of a sudden, cameras can't roll anymore.
*  You can't work without actors.
*  It got the attention of everybody.
*  ["Hollywood's A-Total Stanstill"]
*  Right, now, Hollywood is at a total standstill.
*  Right?
*  No one can work.
*  Including, by the way, John, my own brother,
*  who works in the film industry,
*  he takes photographs on film sets,
*  hasn't worked since the actress won on strike.
*  Really tough.
*  What do the studios do at that point?
*  So, you're the studio executives.
*  This is no longer one irritating union out there.
*  Everything is completely stopped.
*  So you have to deal with somebody.
*  And so the studios said, OK, you know what?
*  Writers, we even talked to them in months.
*  They've been out for a while.
*  We're going to turn to them first.
*  And what happens?
*  So effectively, very little happens.
*  There were negotiations, but it was just very on again,
*  off again, throughout the month of August.
*  There was something about the month of August.
*  There were people saying, vacation.
*  It's like, OK, of course, there are
*  a couple strikes happening, big deal.
*  Right.
*  The temperature changes.
*  Second, we hit the second week of September.
*  All of a sudden, everybody's rubbing a sleep
*  out of their eyes from the summer.
*  And then they looked around and they said,
*  why isn't anybody working?
*  What's happening?
*  And also, the studios just, frankly,
*  begins to look at their balance sheets.
*  Warner Brothers Discovery.
*  Big entertainment company.
*  They had to go out and announce that our adjusted earnings,
*  because of the strikes, are going to take a hit of anywhere
*  between $300 and $500 million this year.
*  That's the studio behind Barbie.
*  Right.
*  Like the hit, huge performance.
*  And even with that performance, Warner Brothers Discovery
*  is starting to sweat this a little bit.
*  Wow.
*  So if this studio is struggling, then every studio is struggling.
*  Precisely.
*  But it's not just the studios.
*  The writers, they've been at a work now for four or five months.
*  It's a long time not to get a paycheck.
*  And by time we're at September, we
*  notice that some of the biggest name writers in Hollywood,
*  Kenya Barris, he created Blackish on ABC.
*  Noah Hawley, he created the TV show, Fargo for FX.
*  Ryan Murphy, he created American Horror Story.
*  They started getting kind of restless.
*  They were saying, what's going on?
*  Why aren't we even in a room?
*  We haven't talked to studios in weeks by this point.
*  And they were trying to meet with guild leadership
*  just to ask, like, what's going on?
*  So they're saying, guys, it's been a while hurry up.
*  What's happening?
*  Exactly.
*  And we're still reporting out what exactly happened there.
*  But here's what we do now.
*  The union in the studios then did agree to meet.
*  And that meeting happened last week.
*  And do we know anything about what those meetings were like,
*  like any details from inside the room?
*  So here's what we do know.
*  Studio executives, top executives were suddenly
*  sitting in the room, Disney Chief Executive, Bob Eiger,
*  Warner Brothers Discovery Chief Executive, David Zazlev,
*  Netflix Co-Chief Executive, Ted Sarandos,
*  and that's huge executive at NBC Universal, Donna Langley.
*  They were sitting in the room that had not happened.
*  And what's the significance of that, John?
*  What did it mean that they were there?
*  It meant we mean business now.
*  Because it's like, whoa, if they're showing up,
*  they want to get this deal done.
*  It's close.
*  It's close.
*  And sure enough, within five days, over the weekend,
*  they reached that tentative agreement.
*  And how they did, it's pretty simple.
*  They went down the writers list of ass
*  and basically hit on all of them.
*  And, most significantly, they opened up their wallet.
*  And they opened up their wallet in a way
*  that they weren't willing to do four or five months ago.
*  So basically, the studios paid up.
*  Exactly.
*  So is the way to think about this, John,
*  that the writers kind of just waited the studios out?
*  Like that the studios couldn't deal with the math
*  of the strike any longer?
*  Turns out they also have finance departments
*  and accountants who were saying,
*  we gotta get something on the table here?
*  Yeah, I mean, the studios were hurting.
*  I mean, they need productions to be happening
*  because they need new shows, they need new movies,
*  they need to put these things on their streaming services.
*  I mean, already we've seen significant fallout
*  from the strikes, perspective blockbuster movies
*  that were scheduled for this year have been moved to next year.
*  TV series that were scheduled for this year
*  have been moved to next year.
*  So they had to make this deal.
*  They did have to open up their wallet.
*  But just because they got this deal,
*  it does not mean that production is gonna start again
*  immediately.
*  Remember, the studios still have another contract
*  to negotiate.
*  The actors are still on strike.
*  You had two walkouts and you've got to solve one
*  before you solve the other.
*  So, host strike, the writers got a lot of what they asked for.
*  The reality is the cost won't just be born by the studios.
*  There might be a cost to the writers too.
*  B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So John, before the break, you said we're about to find out
*  how things are gonna change under this new contract.
*  What type of landscape that is gonna set up?
*  And you said that it won't necessarily be without cost
*  to the writers.
*  At the highest level, how should we think about that change?
*  So, the writers made a lot of gains.
*  They're gonna get paid a lot more,
*  but this also very likely is going to mean.
*  On the other side, next year, the year after that,
*  and the year after that, fewer TV shows.
*  So, tell me about that.
*  Why would necessarily that mean fewer shows?
*  So, let's use Netflix as an example.
*  Netflix's content budget last year was around $17 billion.
*  Oh, God, it's like a small country.
*  And this year, Netflix's budget is around $17 billion.
*  Next year, it'll be around $17 billion.
*  See a trend, the belt trend.
*  And if you're going to pay the writers more money,
*  and you're eventually gonna pay the actors more money,
*  because they will get a deal at some point.
*  The strike is going to end.
*  Well, something's gotta give.
*  Then you don't have as much money to invest
*  in the same number of TV shows or movies.
*  Okay, same pie, but if each show costs more to make,
*  each slice, then there are gonna be fewer slices
*  of the pie to go around.
*  Exactly.
*  Okay, so that's the downside for the writers.
*  Fewer shows to work on.
*  Do they understand that?
*  Like, is that something they've taken on board?
*  I don't quite know yet.
*  I haven't talked to them yet, but here is what we do know.
*  Going into this labor dispute,
*  writers were calling this moment existential.
*  They said they were fighting for their own survival.
*  And with this new contract, screenwriting is still a profession.
*  The writers are still around, they still exist.
*  But are they fully aware of what is a very likely outcome
*  that there are just going to be fewer shows?
*  I don't quite know yet.
*  So what does this new contract mean for me,
*  for Jane consumer?
*  When you believe you may have to pay more money,
*  I know it's shocking.
*  So basically, the economics of streaming,
*  it's been difficult for most media companies
*  over the last decade.
*  Peacock, Paramount Plus, Hulu,
*  these are streaming services that lose a lot of money
*  and still do.
*  So those days where you were paying $7, $6 a month
*  and you're getting endless streaming content,
*  you pay a lot more than that now
*  and you will likely pay more in the future.
*  So kind of like Uber, I had the Apple My Phone forever.
*  It was super cheap.
*  I used it all the time.
*  Suddenly, Cableum, it became really expensive.
*  I stopped using it.
*  Exactly.
*  And to make the balance sheets work,
*  you keep raising prices.
*  And now even more so in the wake of these strikes,
*  the studios are probably going to have to,
*  at some point, some point the next year, raise prices again.
*  So you're saying that the studios may just pass
*  the cost of this new contract onto us?
*  That's what some financial analysts are already saying.
*  And the other thing is,
*  the strikes have lasted for months.
*  So at least in a short and midterm,
*  going into next year,
*  there are going to be fewer TV shows.
*  There are going to be fewer movies.
*  You will find yourself on your couch at some point,
*  clicking on all these streaming services,
*  saying to yourself, where is something new to watch?
*  Like I want, no, give me more choices.
*  I want more choices.
*  And you won't quite have that.
*  But John, what if I don't want quite so many choices?
*  I mean, maybe there's an element of silver lining in this.
*  I mean, there were so many shows, right?
*  Should there be that many shows?
*  Totally.
*  I mean, this is something, if you put true serum
*  in the arm of creative executives,
*  they will say fewer shows that is great.
*  Because then we, as creative executives,
*  have time to focus on quality.
*  We have time to really get in there
*  and help writers with their script
*  and to help with the cuts of a show.
*  So yes, I think long term for consumer, it will be good.
*  Because no, we did not need 600 scripted shows
*  in the United States every single year.
*  I only watched a fraction of them.
*  It's hard to watch that much television,
*  even with all the time in the world.
*  Perhaps I can focus on the good ones.
*  That's right.
*  So John, it strikes me that this is a moment
*  where the streaming industry has just kind of lived
*  through its heavy young maybe teenage days, right?
*  And now we are living into an era
*  in which it has to grow up.
*  And in some ways, we, as consumers,
*  also have to grow up along with it.
*  Which what I mean by that is,
*  we have to realize that these shows
*  do cost a lot of money to make
*  and that we're gonna have to come to terms with the fact
*  that we're gonna have fewer of them
*  and we're gonna have to pay more money to get them.
*  Yeah, I guess we maybe were in sort of our adolescent moment
*  for these streaming services.
*  And as a result, it's a little tricky.
*  It's a little difficult.
*  It's a little tough.
*  And it's gonna be tough for us
*  because the whole promise of streaming was,
*  this was all gonna be so much cheaper, right?
*  This is gonna be so much cheaper than cable.
*  Let's cut the cord, subscribe to a few streaming services
*  and we're good to go.
*  But the prices have been creeping up
*  and there is talk in the entertainment industry now
*  of why don't we bundle a few of these streaming services
*  together?
*  Max, meet, peacock, meet Paramount Plus.
*  So all of a sudden you're starting to recreate cable
*  in some way.
*  So the cost in the end, it's probably going to approach
*  or maybe even match at some point
*  what we use to pay for cable.
*  So John, thinking about this moment more in right now
*  with streaming and at the same time,
*  what's emerging from this new contract,
*  it's almost like we're going back in a way
*  to that old model of TV and film.
*  You know, the pre-streaming version
*  where big entertainment companies made fewer shows,
*  we paid more, but also the writers got paid more.
*  I mean, the studios would love to go back 20 years ago.
*  The writers would love to go back 20 years ago,
*  but that world is just gone now.
*  Streaming has changed everything.
*  This technological change has shifted everything.
*  But in the case of the writer,
*  you're never going to make friends money again,
*  but if you do create a big hit on Netflix,
*  if you do create, say, a Bridgerton,
*  with this contract, it does set you up a little bit better.
*  You're going to get more money than you did,
*  say, four or five years ago.
*  But what's kind of interesting on the other side of the strike,
*  the studios are over here, the writers are over there,
*  and they're both kind of just stumbling their way
*  into the future, trying to make this work.
*  Streaming has changed everything.
*  It's upended everything, and both the studios and the writers
*  are just trying to figure out a way to make it to the other side,
*  when all of a sudden streaming is all that exists
*  and cable television really doesn't exist,
*  or network TV doesn't really exist,
*  and they both still are around.
*  And if you're not sure what you're doing,
*  you're just going to be like a real success,
*  and if they both still are around,
*  writers are still writing, and the studios are still making
*  new TV shows, new movies.
*  So the contract in a way is pushing our, you know,
*  adolescent, rembunctious streaming out of the house.
*  Streaming goes to college.
*  John, thank you.
*  On Tuesday night, the writers' guild of America made the details
*  of its deal with the studios public for the first time.
*  It included major concessions on how the writers are paid,
*  including royalties for overseas viewing.
*  It also guaranteed that the studios will not use artificial intelligence
*  to rewrite original material.
*  The union's 11,500 screenwriter members are expected to approve
*  the three-year deal in a vote that begins on Monday.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  The legal troubles of former president Donald Trump
*  deepened on Tuesday when a New York judge ruled against him
*  in a civil case filed by New York State Attorney General,
*  Leticia James.
*  James had accused Trump of fraud for inflating the value of his assets,
*  and she seeks millions of dollars in damages.
*  But Tuesday's ruling granted one of the biggest punishments
*  James sought, the cancellation of business certificates
*  that allowed some of Trump's New York properties to operate.
*  That could terminate Trump's control over assets that include
*  40 Wall Street, a family estate, a golf club in Westchester County,
*  and Trump Tower.
*  And the Federal Trade Commission and 17 states sued Amazon,
*  setting up a long-awaited antitrust fight that could alter
*  the way Americans shop online.
*  In the 172-page suit, the Federal government accused the e-commerce giant
*  of protecting a monopoly over swaths of online retail
*  by squeezing merchants and favoring its own services.
*  The suit alleges that the retailer's tactics made it impossible
*  for its rivals to compete.
*  Finally, Ukraine acknowledged that there might be some uncertainty
*  surrounding its claim that Russia's Black Sea Fleet Commander
*  was killed in a strike on Crimea.
*  Kyiv said that it was, quote, clarifying whether Victor Sokolov
*  had in fact been killed.
*  On Tuesday, Moscow released a video purporting to show the admiral alive.
*  Today's episode was produced by Shen and Lin,
*  Summer Tomod, Sydney Harper, and Rochelle Bonja.
*  It was edited by MJ Davis Lin with help from Michael Barbaro,
*  contains original music by Mary Anilzano and Will Read,
*  and was engineered by Chris Wood.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Lansford of Wonder League.
*  That's it for the Daily.
*  I'm Sabrina Tevernice. See you tomorrow.
