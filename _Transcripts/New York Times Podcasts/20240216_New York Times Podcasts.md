# An Explosive Hearing in Trump’s Georgia Election Case
**New York Times Podcasts:** [February 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZnVXLSX_y8)
*  From New York Toms, I'm Michael Bobauro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Our relationship wasn't a secret.
*  It was just private.
*  Today.
*  It is an inaccurate way to state the question.
*  And I will certainly restate it so it is very accurate.
*  Okay.
*  And please do not yell at me.
*  An explosive and emotional court hearing on Thursday in Georgia has revealed that what
*  once seemed like a long-shot legal challenge to an election interference case against Donald
*  Trump and his allies is now a serious threat that could derail the entire case.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  This is the truth.
*  It is a lie.
*  It is a lie.
*  My colleague Richard Fauset walks us through the dramatic opening day of testimony.
*  It's Friday, February 16th.
*  Richard, this was one of the most remarkable court hearings I've ever seen.
*  And I watch a lot of court hearings.
*  It was cinematic.
*  It was suspenseful.
*  It was angry.
*  I mean, at one point, the judge stopped the proceedings to kind of ask everyone to calm
*  down and it was extraordinarily high stakes.
*  That's exactly my reaction.
*  There was no idea when the hearing started this morning where it was going to go.
*  Lawyers were making on the fly arguments based on stuff they had just learned.
*  The star witness we thought was going to change the whole shape of the day and perhaps
*  the week didn't end up being the star witness.
*  It ended up being somebody else.
*  And then, of course, we just had this absolute white hot torrent of emotion from Fonny Willis,
*  the prosecutor in this election interference case.
*  And the whole time you're thinking about the stakes, which is that this tremendous criminal
*  case that has a former president in its crosshairs is potentially under threat.
*  Right.
*  Well, I think we have to rewind the clock just a few weeks to establish why this hearing
*  happens and why it is so important and why the drama of this day matters.
*  And this all starts, and I want you to explain this, with a defendant that most of us had
*  never really heard of in this Georgia racketeering case against Donald Trump and his alleged
*  co-conspirators who are accused of allegedly criminally attempting to overturn the Georgia
*  election.
*  So tell us the story of that defendant and how he brings us to this hearing.
*  Sure.
*  So this criminal prosecution started out with an indictment of 19 people, including some
*  serious high profile names.
*  Among them, of course, Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, who was a defendant, Mark Meadows,
*  who served as Donald Trump's White House chief of staff toward the end of his term.
*  But there were also this array of much more obscure and fascinating individuals.
*  And one of them was a guy named Michael Roman.
*  And that's the guy you're talking about.
*  He was a top official in Trump's 2020 campaign.
*  He was Trump's director of election day operations.
*  And he was involved with a number of other lawyers and aides to Donald Trump in creating
*  this idea that there should be these fake electors who could somehow serve as the actual
*  electors to turn the election that Mr. Trump lost in his favor and keep him in the White
*  House.
*  Right.
*  But he definitely was not like a brand named defendant.
*  Exactly.
*  Thank you.
*  So, you know, this case was really kind of rocking along.
*  And it really was a case where the prosecution seemed to have the upper hand.
*  It was pretty airtight in a lot of ways.
*  And four of the 19 original defendants had taken guilty pleas.
*  But what happened is there was one of these many pretrial deadlines on January 8th and
*  sort of out of the blue, Michael Roman's lawyer drops this absolute bomb of emotion in which
*  she makes some allegations that sent the entire case down this kind of course of like a telenovela
*  melodrama that nobody saw coming.
*  Well, just describe this telenovela-esque motion that Michael Roman and his lawyer filed.
*  So the motion that kind of sent everything into this very different direction alleged
*  that Fonny Willis, the district attorney who is heading up the prosecution, was engaged
*  in an affair with the man she hired to manage the case, a man named Nathan Wade, and that
*  he had been paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by the DA's office.
*  And he'd used some of this money to take Fonny Willis on a number of exotic vacations to
*  places like Aruba and Napa Valley.
*  And as a result of all these things, the lawyer argues, both Mr. Wade and Ms. Willis and Ms.
*  Willis's entire office, which happens to be the largest prosecutor's office in the state
*  of Georgia, should all be disqualified from the case.
*  And the idea of disqualifying these prosecutors doesn't just threaten the case against Michael
*  Roman, it threatens the entire case against all the 15 remaining defendants, including
*  Donald Trump.
*  It really creates a scenario by which the case could just go poof.
*  It could just go away.
*  Okay, so putting aside for just a moment the accuracy of this allegation and the motion,
*  can you just explain the legal questions that it raises?
*  Why would a relationship between these two lawyers potentially disqualify them from the
*  case and end up having the whole case potentially thrown out?
*  So Michael Roman's motion makes the case, essentially, that the motives of the district
*  attorney may be less than pure.
*  That what motivates her every day when she wakes up and prosecutes this huge case is
*  not just seeing through a prosecution in the interest of justice, but also this sense that
*  there's a kind of another motive that's working in concert with it, which is to enrich herself
*  because her one-time boyfriend was making all this money that her office is paying him
*  and that she's using it to go on these vacations and that somehow her judgment is clouded.
*  And as a result, the very process of justice is clouded.
*  Got it.
*  So the allegation is that by hiring her boyfriend to work on the case, Fonny Willis's interest
*  becomes not necessarily in properly prosecuting this case, but basically in keeping it going
*  at all costs because it benefits her.
*  That's right.
*  So one of Michael Roman's motions says that the more work that's done on the case, regardless
*  of what justice calls for, the more Fonny Willis and Nathan Wade get paid, the more
*  they fight his motions, the more they get paid, the more they refuse to dismiss defendants
*  who should not be indicted, the more money they make.
*  And that all of this amounted to a conflict of interest.
*  And of course, the more money the special prosecutor makes, Roman's lawyer wrote, the
*  more the district attorney gets to reap the financial benefits.
*  So you get the idea that there's something there that is motivating her beyond just this
*  pure quest to see the justice is done.
*  And what this motion seems to claim is that if this alleged relationship and the benefit
*  that it brings to Fonny Willis can be proven, then this entire case should therefore be
*  thrown out.
*  That's right.
*  Although it's worth keeping in mind that a number of legal scholars have argued that
*  even if all of these allegations were true, there's really no basis for this being construed
*  as a conflict of interest and that these prosecutors should stay on the case and it should be steady
*  as she goes from here on out.
*  That this is all a big distraction that has no legal merit.
*  So what you're saying is that no one's quite sure that legally speaking, there's a real
*  argument here to be made by Michael Roman.
*  And if I'm remembering correctly, the feeling that a lot of people had when this motion
*  was filed was that it was kind of a Hail Mary, right?
*  And there was not much evidence that it was necessarily even true.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I mean, it was a Hail Mary in the sense that Michael Roman's lawyer didn't include
*  any evidence to back up her claim.
*  This very salacious claim.
*  So there was a moment there when nobody knew really what to make of it.
*  It was a very uncomfortable moment given the nature of the allegations and given the seriousness
*  of this case.
*  And a few days after the initial filing by Michael Roman, Fonny Willis gave a speech
*  at an African American church in Atlanta.
*  First thing they say, oh, she's going to play the race card now.
*  But no, God, isn't it them who's playing the race card when they only question one?
*  In which she sort of portrayed this whole thing as a big witch hunt.
*  She also insinuated that race was a motivation for the scrutiny of her and for Nathan Wade,
*  both of whom are African American.
*  God, wasn't it them that attacked this lawyer of impeccable credentials?
*  The black man I chose has been a judge more than 10 years.
*  Is it that some will never see a black man as qualified, no matter his achievements?
*  What more can one achieve?
*  The other two have never been.
*  But then a few days later, it looked like there was indeed some there there.
*  It came out that there were some credit card statements that showed that Nathan Wade had
*  bought tickets to vacation destinations for himself and for Fonny Willis.
*  So it started to look like this is more than just a figment of someone's imagination.
*  But Fonny Willis and her office were convinced that there is really no legal basis for an
*  affair to result in her being disqualified.
*  She files a motion that essentially acknowledges the affair.
*  It included a sworn affidavit from Nathan Wade in which he said, yes, there was an affair.
*  It started in 2022 after I'd started working for the DA's office in November 2021.
*  But the argument was, yes, there is some there there.
*  However, Judge, there's no need for an evidentiary hearing.
*  Just looking at the law, there is no reason why this relationship between two consenting
*  adults in their 50s should have any bearing on an election interference case involving
*  a former president of the United States.
*  But another dramatic moment comes when the judge basically says, look, we've got to determine
*  the contours of this thing because if these allegations were true, there is a possibility
*  that this did constitute a conflict of interest or an appearance of a conflict of interest,
*  which might be enough for him to disqualify these prosecutors.
*  So he went ahead and he set the evidentiary hearing.
*  And the judge's decision was a tremendous loss for Fonny Willis in her office.
*  And not only because she felt like this was an absolutely untoward and sort of offensive
*  intrusion into her personal life, but it also meant that this question was was live.
*  This question of whether or not there was some basis to disqualify her in her office
*  and send what without question is the biggest case she'll ever have
*  to a place where we're really not sure whether it'll end up in a trial at all.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Richard headed into Thursday's evidentiary hearing, this highly anticipated legal session.
*  What are the biggest questions that everyone's looking for answers to?
*  Well, some of the biggest questions were laid out by the judge himself,
*  and they all had to do with his interest in the extent to which there was some kind of
*  financial benefit to these prosecutors as a result of this criminal case.
*  The first question has to do with timing.
*  Fonny Willis and Nathan Wade have said their relationship started after November 2021,
*  which is his key date when he begins working as a contractor for the Fulton County District
*  Attorney's Office. Michael Roman's lawyer, a lawyer named Ashley Merchant, had asserted
*  that she was going to be able to prove that the affair started beforehand.
*  And all this, we think, is of interest to the judge because it just looks different when you're
*  thinking about the question of self-dealing. Did you hire a guy and this guy is someone you,
*  after long hours at the office or whatever, you kind of fell for and things progressed from there?
*  Or was it somebody who was really kind of already established as a boyfriend?
*  And what you're really doing is hooking up your boyfriend with a plum job.
*  And so that was one key piece and one key question everyone had going in.
*  The second had to do more with the money as it pertains to the trips that Fonny Willis and
*  Nathan Wade took together to Aruba, to California wine country. The prosecutors had claimed that
*  roughly split the cost of these trips. They didn't provide a huge amount of evidence.
*  They provided a little bit of evidence that seemed to sort of hint at this idea.
*  But the judge obviously wanted to see a lot more. And in fact, during the hearing,
*  both of these issues were indeed quite big. Okay. So walk us through the most important
*  moments of testimony, especially as they relate to these two key questions.
*  All rise. Thank you all. Please be seated.
*  All right. We are on the record with 23.
*  Well, the first issue, the timing issue, when did the affair start
*  was something that we thought was going to be answered because Michael Roman's lawyer
*  said it was going to be answered by a man named Terrence Bradley, who received a subpoena to
*  testify. Good morning, Mr. Bradley. How are you?
*  Good morning. Not happy to be here, I'm assuming.
*  I am not. Okay. I understand. Thank you for being here.
*  Wasn't by choice. Right.
*  Mr. Bradley is a former law partner of Nathan Wade's. He also served for a time
*  as Nathan Wade's divorce lawyer. When did Mr. Wade come to you to file
*  the divorce action in Cobb County? That's that's privileged information.
*  But when Terrence Bradley took the stand, almost immediately, he was met with a barrage
*  of concerns from defense lawyers and they threw up all these objections.
*  Are you aware of when their romantic relationship began?
*  Your Honor, I'm going to object. That relates to privilege.
*  She says that he began some of them on some technical legal grounds, some of them on this
*  very specific technical legal ground, that there was an attorney client privilege that should
*  prevent him from discussing anything having to do essentially with the affair.
*  And I have consulted with the bar. I cannot reveal anything that I saw or learned.
*  Mr. Bradley is kind of sitting on the stand saying, look, you know, I talked to the bar
*  association. There's really very little for me to do here. If I want to keep my law license,
*  I need to just kind of keep it zipped. So Mr. Bradley, you may be excused for now.
*  Thank you. We will call Mr. Yurte. So as kind of all this is unfolding,
*  there's a little bit of chaos in the courtroom and you can see that some people's hackles are
*  being raised. Michael Roman's lawyer says, okay, well, I'm just going to call another person that
*  I've served the subpoena. Would you please state and spare your full name for the court?
*  Robin Latrice Yurte. This is a woman named Robin Yurte.
*  Can you tell the judge when you first met Ms. Willis?
*  In college. Who is a former friend of Fonny Willis.
*  And do you understand it that their relationship began in 2019 and continued until the last time
*  you spoke with her? Yes.
*  And you were essentially her best friend during this time, right?
*  Not best friend. Good friend.
*  Good friend. Okay. Close friend.
*  And she asserted that she knew Fonny quite well and that Fonny Willis's affair with Nathan
*  Wade started before his start date of November 2021. A pretty key piece of testimony that
*  directly contradicts what Wade and Willis claim to be the starting point of their relationship.
*  Yes. She was very emphatic about this point. You have no doubt that their romantic relationship
*  was in effect from 2019 until the last time you spoke with her.
*  No doubt. So it was obviously a very dramatic moment.
*  And it of course raises the question of whether or not someone is lying.
*  Right. Another thing that Ms. Yurte's
*  testimony did was it gave the defense attorneys the ability to call their next witness to the
*  stand. My name is Nathan Wade.
*  Who was none other than Nathan Wade himself. When did your romantic relationship with Ms.
*  Willis begin? 2022.
*  When? In 2022. Early 2022.
*  Nathan Wade takes the stand and he continues to insist that the romantic relationship between him
*  and Fonny Willis began in 2022 after he'd been hired by her to do the Trump case. But a lot of
*  his testimony centered around questions about whether or not she had paid him for roughly half
*  of all of these trips. What I'll add is that our travel was split
*  roughly evenly. So where you see I have booked a flight or I've paid for a flight with my credit
*  card. What you don't see is that she covered her own flight reimbursement to me.
*  So this roughly sharing travel, you're saying she reimbursed you.
*  She did. And where did you
*  deposit the money she reimbursed you? It was cash. She didn't give me any
*  checks. So she paid you cash for her share of all these vacations.
*  Mr. Schaefer, you'll step out if you do that. He claims that Fonny Willis repaid him for a
*  number of these travel related vacation expenses in cash. In fact, everything got repaid in cash.
*  2023 December, you said you didn't have any receipts.
*  I do not have any receipts. I did not have any receipts.
*  But you did travel with Ms. Willis. He also said at one point that he didn't have
*  any deposit slips that showed that he'd received the cash and then deposited it.
*  That she was somebody who was an independent woman. It was very important for her to make sure that
*  they more or less went Dutch on stuff. And that the way she did it was not through an app. It
*  wasn't by writing a check. It wasn't Venmo. It was, you know, with physical American currency.
*  So Wade is saying this was all on the up and up. Fonny Willis, his girlfriend at the time,
*  was paying for half of everything, but he can't prove it because she's paying him back in cash
*  and he doesn't have any records of depositing that cash.
*  Yeah, that's right. And as you can imagine, this was received with something like extreme
*  incredulity from the defense lawyers. And she paid you cash for both of your
*  portions or just hers? Both.
*  Okay. So that trip Belize, just Belize, she paid you for everything on Belize.
*  The entire trip. And of course, to the defense lawyers,
*  all this felt a little bit too convenient. The fact that these cash payments, of course,
*  would have no record to preserve that they actually happened.
*  Right. So at this point, and Richard, I was watching some of this testimony,
*  things are not going super well for Fonny Willis or Nathan Wade. We've got this witness saying
*  the relationship between the two of them started earlier than either has acknowledged.
*  We have no records that Fonny Willis reimbursed Wade. It's rough sledding.
*  That's right. And all right, Ms. Merchant, any other witnesses?
*  Yes, we would call Fonny Willis. In the middle of all this steps, Fonny Willis.
*  Ask the court that the court allow Ms. Willis to be called and interrogated on these matters.
*  And I would to, Your Honor.
*  Who walked unaccompanied through the front door of the courtroom.
*  I'm right there.
*  Okay. So.
*  And she said something to the effect of let's do this. And she said it at a time when her lawyer
*  was trying to argue to the judge that there was no reason why her testimony should even be necessary.
*  But she really made this kind of dramatic decision to go ahead and put herself on the stand.
*  Ms. Willis, when, how did you know to come into the courtroom right then?
*  There were people I was pacing in my office.
*  Okay.
*  And I heard someone yell his testimony is done. It only made sense to me that I would be your next
*  witness. And I've been very anxious to have this conversation with you today. So I ran to the
*  courtroom.
*  It was very much in keeping with Fonny Willis and her personality, which is extremely big.
*  So she is confronted by Ashley Merchant, the lawyer for Michael Roman. And these two women
*  have this very intense face off.
*  Let's start back in 2019. So you and Mr. Wade met in October, 2019 at a conference.
*  That is correct. And I think in one of your motions, you tried to implicate,
*  I slept with him at that conference, which I find to be extremely offensive.
*  And from the get go, it's obvious that Fonny Willis is extremely angry.
*  And keep the answers confined to the questions as best you can. I think you'll have more than
*  enough ample opportunity on when the state-
*  It's highly offensive when someone lies on you. And it's highly offensive when they try to
*  implicate that you slept with somebody the first day you met with them. And I take exception to it.
*  And it was just a searing series of moments.
*  No, no, no, no, this is the truth. It is a lie.
*  Mr. Sanow, thank you. We're going to take five minutes.
*  And the judge, Judge McAfee, basically shut the proceedings down for about five minutes,
*  which is very Judge McAfee thing to do. He's a very kind of even keeled judge.
*  And you could tell he needed to just put a damper on things and
*  give everybody a chance to, including Fonny Willis, to just cool down.
*  And what do we end up learning from Fonny Willis' dramatic
*  testimony here about some of the key questions we have been talking about?
*  Well, one of the most important things we learned from Fonny Willis' testimony
*  was that she is going to stick to her story and Nathan Wade's story.
*  And you all start, when did you start dating?
*  When I started dating Mr. Wade. It was right around then.
*  April 2022?
*  22, yes.
*  That their romantic relationship really only blossomed in 2022.
*  You know, it's not like when you're in grade school and you send a little letter
*  and it says, will you be my girlfriend? And you check it.
*  I don't know the day that we started seeing each other, but it was early 22 is my recollection.
*  Okay.
*  After she hired him to work on the Trump case.
*  I would say we had a tough conversation in August.
*  She also told us that they stopped dating sometime around the summer of 2023
*  before the Trump indictment was handed up.
*  So let's just back up and talk about the first time that you went to Florida with Mr. Wade.
*  That was the time that you said you stayed in Miami at the hotel.
*  And there was also this really interesting conversation about the fact that it was Nathan
*  Wade who had put so many of these travel related charges on his own credit cards.
*  So yes, he paid. He is the original one that does it.
*  Mr. Wade is a world traveler. I'm not as versed as him.
*  He's been to six of the seven continents.
*  And so he has both a personal travel agent and he also has a cruise travel.
*  She said that he's a world traveler, that he's really, you know, in that relationship,
*  he was the guy who was more experienced in setting up travel plans and paying for them.
*  I know he initially paid for it. Did you pay him back?
*  For the cruise and for Aruba. Yeah, I gave him his money before we ever went on that trip.
*  You gave him cash before you ever went on the trip?
*  Okay. And so when you got cash to pay him back on these trips, would you go to the ATM?
*  No, lady.
*  You would not go to the ATM?
*  No.
*  And then there was also a really interesting conversation about why she relied so much on cash
*  to reimburse him for some of these travel expenses.
*  So the cash that you would pay him, you wouldn't get it out of the bank?
*  I have money in my house.
*  You have money in your house. So it was just money that was there?
*  When you meet my father, he was going to tell you as a woman, you should always have,
*  which I don't have, so let's don't tell him that.
*  You should have at least six months in cash at your house at all times.
*  I don't know why this old black man feels like that, but he does.
*  Her argument was that it was really based in a lot of things that her father,
*  who she's very close to and who really played a very big role in raising her,
*  passed on to her, which is that you need to have a certain amount of cash around on you.
*  If you're a woman and you go on a date with a man, you better have $200 in your pocket.
*  So if that man acts up, you can go where you want to go.
*  There is an empowering element of this that he taught her.
*  It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that,
*  as he told me one time, the only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich.
*  We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal.
*  Ms. Willis also made it clear that in this romantic relationship, there was no question
*  that she wanted to be treated as an equal. She in fact called out Mr.
*  Wade for some sexist ideas that he had. Which is why I would give him his money back.
*  I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.
*  When you heard this coming from her, at least when I heard it coming from her,
*  you had this sort of coherent idea of why somebody like Fonny Willis would be so reliant on cash.
*  It had also served in a way to buttress what Nathan Wade had just said. The fact that she
*  was a person who paid him back in this way. Listening to it, I kind of went from a sense of,
*  okay, well, this sounds bizarre that you would just show up at your boyfriend's house with an
*  Adidas bag stuffed with bills to something that's more like, well, okay, this is plausible. This is
*  something that's been passed down. It's something that you could maybe, I can't verify it, but it
*  just seems like something that would be plausible in this moment when cash is kind of on the way
*  out for some people. But for some other people, it really feels like an empowering tool.
*  Right. In the end, she doesn't give an inch on these questions of when the relationship started
*  and whether she benefited from it. That's right. She stuck to her guns and she also
*  had a really dramatic moment where she tried to remind everyone who was following along
*  that she was not on trial. So your office objected to us getting Delta records for flights that you
*  may have taken when this happened. Well, no, no, no. I object to you getting records. You've been
*  intrusive into people's personal lives. You're confused. You think I'm on trial. These people
*  are on trial for trying to steal an election in 2020. I'm not on trial, no matter how hard you
*  try to put me on trial. She said it was the people who tried to overturn the election who
*  were on trial. And that was one of the moments that really sort of sent a real kind of shock
*  through the courtroom. You have this melodrama, this kind of footnote that's now ballooned into
*  its own story. And it was a very interesting moment of kind of redirecting the flow of the
*  conversation back to very fundamental questions about democracy and efforts to subvert it.
*  Ms. Wilson, you can step down. You're done for the day. You want me to lead the courtroom?
*  Or you can sit at the council table. We don't need you in the witness box.
*  Richard, by the end of this testimony, Yerdy, Wade, Willis, a pretty complicated
*  portrait has emerged of this relationship that's now at the center of these questions of whether
*  this case involving democracy moves forward. I mean, this one witness says the relationship
*  starts before Willis hired Wade, but it's just her word. There's no hard evidence.
*  And Wade and Willis, under oath, disagree. It becomes clear that Wade did pay for a lot of
*  travel for Willis. And yet Willis says she reimbursed him, but there's no evidence that
*  either of them can produce to verify that. So there aren't really smoking guns in either direction.
*  Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, what we do know is that we're going to have a lot more
*  testimony. We're going to have more witnesses who will probably be called. But I do think that this
*  has given Donald Trump and his allies the ability to create a kind of plume of suspicion that there
*  were bad intentions behind this case. And I think we should think about what the real practical
*  ramifications of that issue are. And by an issue, I mean a public relations loss for the
*  district attorney's office. It has a real potential material effect because the jury that sits
*  to decide whether or not Donald Trump broke the law in Georgia will come from Fulton County.
*  And if they continue to read headlines that say that something is fishy about
*  Fonny Willis and her boyfriend or ex-boyfriend and their travel, you could potentially see
*  a greater possibility that at the very least one of those 12 future jurors decides that something
*  is too fishy for them to vote guilty. And in that way, this entire drama is extremely relevant no
*  matter what the judge rules in the coming days. In other words, no matter what the judge decides,
*  whether he keeps them on the case or just qualifies Willis and Wade, something about this case in its
*  fundamental mission has been altered here and maybe weakened. I think that's possible. And one of the
*  things I find so remarkable is that we've all thought of the Georgia case is one that really
*  couldn't be touched by Donald Trump. If he were to be reelected, he couldn't pardon himself. He
*  couldn't direct his future attorney general to dismiss the case. And yet, here we are with this
*  threat to the Georgia case that's coming from a very different place. That's coming from
*  what some people would argue would be a lapse in judgment. It's almost unfathomable to imagine
*  that a history could be bent by something like that. But here we are.
*  Well, Richard, thank you very much. We appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  The hearing is scheduled to resume this morning with Fonny Willis expected to return to the stand.
*  A ruling on whether she and Nathan Wade should be removed from the case is expected in the next few weeks.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. A judge in New York has officially scheduled the first
*  criminal trial against Donald Trump to begin on March 25th, ensuring that the former president
*  will face at least one jury before election day. That trial, led by the Manhattan district attorney,
*  will focus on allegations that Trump falsified business records during his 2016 presidential
*  campaign in order to hide a sexual relationship with an adult film star.
*  And police in Kansas City said they believed that a dispute between teenagers was the cause of a mass
*  shooting at a Super Bowl victory celebration that injured nearly two dozen people and killed a 43
*  year old woman. Police identified that woman as Elizabeth Galvin, a local DJ whose son was also
*  shot in the leg during the gunfire. Today's episode was produced by Rob Zipko, Sidney Harper,
*  and Alex Stern with help from Rochelle Banja. It was edited by Devin Taylor, contains original music
*  by Dan Powell and Marian Lozano, and was engineered by Chris Wood. Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg
*  and Ben Lansferk of Wonderly. Special thanks to John Ketchum.
*  That's it for the day. I'm Michael Babor. See you on Monday.
