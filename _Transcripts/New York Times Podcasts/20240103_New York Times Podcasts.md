# Biden’s 2024 Playbook
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBNyZqXf83I)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Yesterday on the show, we went inside Donald Trump's campaign for president to understand
*  how he's trying to turn a mountain of legal trouble into a political advantage.
*  Today, we turn to the re-election campaign of President Biden.
*  I spoke with my colleague, Reid Epstein, about why what looks like a record of accomplishment
*  on paper is turning out to be so difficult to campaign on.
*  It's Wednesday, January 3rd.
*  Reid, hi.
*  Sabrina, hi.
*  So Reid, yesterday, our esteemed colleague, Maggie Haberman, was on the show, and she
*  was talking about Donald Trump's 2024 campaign strategy.
*  And fittingly, we come to you to talk about what Joe Biden's 2024 strategy will be like.
*  Biden, of course, has presided over a relatively strong economy.
*  He's passed a bunch of legislation, some of it very sweeping, some of it even bipartisan,
*  despite historic levels of partisanship.
*  And the presumptive nominee on the other side is facing 91 felony counts.
*  And yet, and I know it's early, but I have to be honest, so far, it's been a little hard
*  to figure out what Biden's message actually is.
*  So Reid, what is Biden running on?
*  Well, part of Biden's problem is that a lot of these things that you articulated that
*  should be strengths for him, frankly, are not.
*  They're political weaknesses.
*  He's been trying to sell his record and trying to explain to people that their lives are
*  better under him.
*  But the thing that you're seeing is that a lot of these things that Biden accomplished,
*  he's not able to talk about because voters don't think that they're selling points.
*  Can you give me an example?
*  Well, the economy is really the biggest one.
*  All of the indicators that we have on the economy would tell you that the economy is
*  booming, that things are going great.
*  But if you ask people about how they feel about the economy, they don't feel good about
*  it.
*  People see that prices are still up.
*  They see that they can't buy a house because the interest rates are high.
*  And so none of that is great for Joe Biden.
*  Joe Biden is determined to reward hard work.
*  They spent about $40 million in battleground states.
*  Over 12 million jobs have been created.
*  Trying to sell the president's economic record.
*  Bidenomics.
*  Bidenomics.
*  And the net effect of that so far has not been any great change in the polls.
*  In fact, the polls for Joe Biden have gotten worse.
*  And it seems pretty clear.
*  I'm Joe Biden and I approve this message.
*  The advertising that they've done has not really worked.
*  So basically, bottom line, the economy, despite all of the economists telling us it should
*  add up to a strength for Joe Biden in his campaign, has not.
*  Right.
*  What are the other accomplishments, aside from the economy, that he could be running
*  on that would potentially be a strength?
*  Well, he did pass a bunch of pretty significant pieces of legislation on infrastructure, on
*  climate investments, on the CHIPS Act.
*  All of these laws are spending exorbitant amounts of money all around the country for
*  projects that will build new bridges, that will build solar factories.
*  All things that pull very well individually.
*  People say that they want, but you can't snap your fingers and have a new bridge.
*  Some of these things take years and years to happen.
*  And in the meantime, what people see on infrastructure, frankly, is road construction.
*  Right.
*  And in a lot of these states, you have local officials that are taking credit for projects
*  that federal legislation is subsidizing that Joe Biden signed.
*  So a lot of federal money has flowed to Georgia, and you have the Republican governor, Brian
*  Kemp, who's running around taking credit for it.
*  There's a bridge between Cincinnati and Kentucky that the governor of Kentucky and Mitch McConnell
*  have taken a lot of credit for.
*  And so not only are these projects not immediate, people don't see immediate results on it,
*  but he's competing with local officials to take credit for it.
*  Reed, you mentioned big legislation, and I know that part of what passed in the legislation
*  that our colleagues were writing about a lot last year, the Inflation Reduction Act, had
*  to do with climate and climate change and kind of alleviating some of the effects of
*  it.
*  I would imagine that would play pretty well with his base.
*  Can he campaign on that?
*  He has campaigned on that.
*  I traveled with him this summer to a factory in Milwaukee that was making charging stations
*  for electric vehicles.
*  But again, a lot of these projects are just getting off the ground.
*  It's going to take a while for those things to have an impact on people's lived experiences.
*  Right.
*  Okay, so Reed, you're saying essentially that the typical strategy of an incumbent president,
*  you know, where you point to the things you've accomplished over your time in office, is
*  not exactly working for Biden for a variety of reasons.
*  Well, what about pointing to the thing that Biden would argue his presidency kind of represents,
*  you know, the sort of larger idea of democracy, upholding democratic norms and protecting
*  them?
*  That seems like a clear way to draw a contrast between himself and former President Trump
*  that would be something his campaign would latch onto.
*  Right.
*  I mean, if you remember when he ran in 2020, he talked about restoring the soul of America
*  and that, you know, after January 6th became imbued with the idea of protecting democracy.
*  But there wasn't anything really for Biden to do on that front other than talk about
*  it.
*  So even though the president has talked about democracy and talked about himself as the
*  person upholding it, we haven't seen that voters are racing to back him because of that
*  issue.
*  And Reed, what does the polling say?
*  The polling says that people who are interested in democracy as an issue, they're interested
*  in other issues more usually.
*  I think it's instructive to look at the midterm elections in Wisconsin, how Democrats attacked
*  this issue when they were running against Ron Johnson, who was a senator who has been
*  kind of a font of misinformation, who sort of questioned the results of the election,
*  cast doubts on what happened on January 6th.
*  They did not run against him as an election denier or someone who was amplifying misinformation
*  because every which way they tested it in polls and focus groups, they found that the
*  most effective way of getting people to not vote for him was to talk about his economic
*  record and not about his stance on democracy or misinformation.
*  And they ultimately, like Ron Johnson won, and so they can have a debate about whether
*  the strategy was right or not, but they had spent a lot of time and had a vested interest
*  in defeating him and concluded that democracy was not the best way to do it.
*  That's really interesting that democracy, I guess, is just this abstract thing that
*  doesn't necessarily on its own as a word mean much to people.
*  Well, and what they found in Wisconsin was that any voter who cared about democracy as
*  an issue was already going to vote for the Democratic candidate.
*  Okay, so democracy, not really a thing for swing voters, not an arrow he can put in his
*  quiver.
*  What about the fact that Trump is facing multiple indictments?
*  I mean, come March, he's scheduled to be on trial in federal court, right?
*  Is that a strength for Biden?
*  I mean, something he'd want to sell on the campaign trail?
*  This is sort of the trickiest issue for Joe Biden as he's running for re-election.
*  Joe Biden has said from the beginning that he will not interfere or discuss Donald Trump's
*  legal issues because he ran for president on the idea of restoring the independence
*  of the Justice Department.
*  And he does not want to back off of that in any way.
*  Despite what Trump says on a daily basis where he is blaming Biden for the prosecution of
*  him, Biden does not want to give that any credence.
*  So he doesn't talk about it.
*  He has instructed his campaign not to talk about it.
*  He's instructed the Democratic National Committee not to talk about it.
*  And so the biggest organizations that are devoted to re-electing Joe Biden president
*  and his White House have taken a collective vow of silence on the biggest thing concerning
*  Donald Trump in the next year.
*  In other words, he doesn't want to be seen as having put his thumb on the scale with
*  his Justice Department in these federal prosecutions of Trump.
*  Okay, so you've laid out this list of would-be strengths that are functioning really at this
*  point as weaknesses for Biden, you know, things he wants to talk about but really can't, which
*  leads me to wonder if his strengths are this weak.
*  What about his actual weaknesses?
*  Tell me about those.
*  If you ask voters about it, and we've done polls, I've gone door to door with candidates,
*  and you ask people, what do you think of Joe Biden?
*  I have real concerns.
*  Inevitably, the first response is...
*  He just seems out of it, honestly.
*  I can't believe he's so old.
*  The way he walks stiffly, and sometimes when he seems not to be able to remember things.
*  He's on the verge of losing it, I think.
*  So I wouldn't want this guy out there running the show.
*  Every poll has suggested that it's a big problem.
*  And it's the one thing that they can't change.
*  In theory, they could fix their economic messaging, the economy could get better.
*  But there's nothing they can do about Joe Biden being 81 years old and the way that
*  people view him.
*  Certainly, the Trump campaign and Republicans will do everything they can to take advantage
*  of when he tripped during a graduation ceremony or fell on the stairs going up to Air Force One.
*  I know that people who work for Biden live in fear of that happening on a regular basis.
*  So what's his campaign doing to combat this age problem he has?
*  I know I'm 198 years old.
*  Well he has started to make some jokes about it.
*  I know I don't look that old, I know.
*  I'm a little under 103.
*  I believe in the First Amendment.
*  Not just because my good friend Jimmy Madison wrote it.
*  He has made jokes about being around with the founding fathers.
*  That's kind of funny.
*  That's not too much to ask.
*  You okay?
*  I want the press to know that wasn't me.
*  But he hasn't fully leaned into the age question in a way that that experience is what the
*  country needs, which frankly leaves him vulnerable when he does have senior moments.
*  He has dealt with aging relatives, grandparents, parents, and seen how people slow down when
*  they get older.
*  And the real danger is that people start to see that in him and wonder whether he's up
*  for the job.
*  So what are they doing instead then?
*  What's the strategy?
*  Just not have him out there so he won't potentially trip?
*  What's going to happen?
*  He doesn't do as many events, certainly as Barack Obama did when he was running for re-election.
*  His days are shorter than other presidents.
*  He doesn't do a lot of one-on-one interviews with mainstream, straight news reporters.
*  Instead they have tried to package him in a way online and have people vouch for him
*  in the press.
*  I'm here to tell the truth about the Biden-Harris record and also compare...
*  Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, did a debate against Ron DeSantis on Fox News
*  where Newsom spent much of the debate defending the Biden record.
*  Biden administration, the last three years, it's been a massive...
*  Joe Biden's paying you tonight...
*  3.9%...
*  I thought this was state versus state.
*  But it's about the United States of America.
*  I thought this guy was running for president of the United States.
*  It almost sounded like he thought that it was on the rest of the party to pull Joe Biden
*  over the line as opposed to Biden doing it himself.
*  Usually in a presidential election, it is on the candidate to do that, not necessarily
*  on his surrogates.
*  But because of Joe Biden's age, because his own popularity is so low and the popularity
*  of many of his surrogates are so high, Newsom and others have come to the conclusion that
*  they have to be the ones to convince voters to vote for Joe Biden almost more than Joe
*  Biden doing it.
*  So, we're taking all of this together.
*  What kind of path does that leave Biden in his campaign?
*  Well, Joe Biden, as we talked about, is not very popular.
*  Voters think he's very old.
*  But the upside for him is that he appears to have the good fortune of running against
*  Donald Trump, who is even less popular than he is.
*  In politics, like in everything else, you have to play to your strengths.
*  And it's left him to try to make the case to voters that he's better than Donald Trump.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Reid, you just explained to me all of the things Biden wants to talk about but can't,
*  and then this thing he doesn't want to talk about, his age, but kind of has to.
*  And that's a pretty tough needle to thread.
*  How is Biden going to handle this?
*  What's his campaign actually going to focus on?
*  Well, the biggest issue for Democrats in this moment is abortion.
*  It is the issue that energizes more Democrats to vote than any other issue.
*  And it is the issue that turns more Republicans and swing voters to vote for Democrats than
*  any other issue.
*  They have seen the success of running on abortion from the midterms to the Wisconsin Supreme
*  Court election in April to the governor's race in Kentucky in November and a referendum
*  on abortion rights in Ohio that won 57% of the vote in a deeply red state.
*  And so one of the big challenges for the Biden campaign, frankly, and for Democrats running
*  for Congress and the Senate, will be to make it clear to voters that abortion rights are
*  on the ballot next November.
*  And so we have started to see this from candidates for the House and Senate.
*  It's a little more complicated for Joe Biden because he has a long and tortured history
*  with abortion rights.
*  He doesn't say the word abortion with much frequency when he says it at all.
*  Being an 80-year-old Catholic, it's difficult.
*  Being an 81-year-old Catholic who, for much of his career in politics, was not a staunch
*  proponent of abortion rights up until his last presidential campaign.
*  And so one thing that we have seen from his supporters when they offer him unsolicited
*  advice is that he needs to say the word abortion more often.
*  They see the power of this issue in their constituencies, in their states, and they
*  are pressing the White House in public and private to have Biden say the word abortion
*  and make his campaign a referendum on abortion rights.
*  Okay, so his campaign wants him to say the word abortion more, wants abortion to be kind
*  of a part of his campaign.
*  But what would he actually say about it?
*  Because I get how Democrats at the state level would want to talk about it because abortion
*  is playing out at the state level right now.
*  But what's the point of someone running for president talking about it?
*  It's not being decided at a federal level.
*  Well, not yet, but it could be.
*  And one thing that we have heard from Democrats is that they would like to pass federal legislation
*  codifying the right to an abortion, whether that's some sort of Roe standard that they
*  could pass into law at a federal level.
*  But at the very least, what they have is scaring people about what Republicans would do if
*  they had the White House in control of both chambers of Congress.
*  So that seems pretty clear, at least what they have said they would do.
*  Some of that has played out in the Republican presidential debates.
*  Lindsey Graham has talked about a 15 week ban.
*  The new House speaker has talked about a total ban on abortion.
*  And so if Trump were to win and have control of Congress, it's not unreasonable to think
*  that they would enact an abortion ban.
*  And so that is what the Biden campaign and Biden himself have to run against.
*  And it's not really difficult to imagine that Trump will give them more fodder on that front.
*  He is not terribly disciplined in how he talks about a lot of these issues.
*  And he is the guy who appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who overturned the
*  right to abortion.
*  So there's this quite interesting new political reality we have now with abortion, where it's
*  no longer a liability.
*  It's actually an asset and it's been helping Democrats a lot up and down the ballot and
*  could potentially even help President Biden in his campaign.
*  But you also mentioned Trump here and this contrast with Trump.
*  Talk to me a little bit about that, Reid.
*  How is that playing into Biden's campaign?
*  Well, the thing that the Biden camp believes it needs to do is convince voters that this
*  election is not a referendum on whether you like Joe Biden, but that it's a choice between
*  Joe Biden and a return to Donald Trump and everything that went along with it.
*  And the theory is what there?
*  The theory is that voters may be dissatisfied with Joe Biden and they may not be in love
*  with Joe Biden and they may not like that he's 81 years old.
*  But they elected him in the first place because they really didn't like Donald Trump and
*  they didn't like the idea of having a chaotic presence in the White House that was in their
*  lives on a daily basis in their Facebook feeds and on the news.
*  And, you know, that Trump, if you remember when Trump was in the White House, he was the
*  topic of conversations that, you know, literally games and PTA meetings and like it was just
*  everywhere. Completely.
*  It's like it's like the metaphor was there's a horse in the hospital.
*  Where's it going to be next? The horse is in the elevator.
*  What? It's like it was everybody was kind of off guard with this idea that there was chaos
*  erupting literally everywhere at every time.
*  And what Biden was, was a promise to not be chaotic, that you wouldn't you could live
*  your life and go through many days at a time without thinking about Joe Biden and without
*  thinking about the president.
*  Right. So so they're betting that this chaotic presence is going to come roaring back onto
*  the political scene and suddenly everybody's going to remember who this guy is.
*  Right. But their problem is that Trump is much easier to ignore now than he was when he
*  was in the White House. The cable networks don't carry his rallies live.
*  He's not active on the major social media platforms.
*  You know, news of him is a little more siloed than it was before.
*  And so part of the challenge for the Biden campaign, frankly, is putting Trump back in
*  those people's lives.
*  Donald Trump often says we're now quote, we're now a failing nation.
*  We're a nation to decline.
*  And so we've seen a conscious shift from the Biden campaign and even from Biden himself
*  in turning their campaign into a not Trump apparatus.
*  You know, we always believe diversity is our strength as a nation.
*  I don't believe, as the president, former president said again yesterday, that immigrants
*  are polluting, polluting our blood.
*  Because their bet is that if people can hear Trump saying things that are outrageous,
*  but not so out of character for Donald Trump, Trump says the Constitution gave him, quote,
*  the right to do whatever he wants as president, end of quote.
*  It will remind people of the chaos they did not like when he was the president.
*  Just remember how the pandemic hit black businesses especially hard.
*  How my predecessor on his watch, women and minority owned small businesses found themselves
*  last in line to access emergency relief.
*  And scare people into voting for Joe Biden and against Donald Trump.
*  That's pretty interesting, right?
*  They're actually trying to give more oxygen to this guy that the oxygen was taken away
*  from after January 6th and he lost the election.
*  I mean, trying to put him smack dab back into the middle of the political landscape is,
*  you know, an interesting strategy.
*  Right. I mean, they have concluded that every day that the news is about Donald Trump
*  is a good day for Joe Biden.
*  So, Reed, it really seems like a lot of Biden's campaign strategy is just kind of wait and
*  see. You know, it doesn't feel like he's really in the driver's seat steering the bus.
*  He's just sort of waiting for things to break his way.
*  Like he's playing defense, not offense.
*  And it's kind of puzzling because, you know, he's an incumbent with a good economy.
*  He's managed to get some major legislation passed and he's running against a potential
*  convicted felon.
*  But he's still performing very poorly.
*  Has the Biden campaign been dealt a particularly tough hand or is it just uniquely bad at
*  messaging?
*  Well, Joe Biden himself is not great at messaging, right?
*  Right. He's not Barack Obama.
*  Right. He, you know, he doesn't draw huge crowds.
*  He doesn't draw the sort of intense loyalty of Bernie Sanders even.
*  Even when he when he was running for president in 2020, like there weren't crowds of like
*  many thousands of people coming out to see Joe Biden.
*  He was a consensus candidate because people thought he could beat Donald Trump.
*  The Trump voters, I was interviewing a lot at the time, were always talking about that.
*  Look at the stadiums. No one's there.
*  No one shows up for him.
*  Right. But a vote from somebody who is super excited about a candidate counts the same
*  as a vote from somebody who is kind of meh, but thinks he's better than the other guy.
*  Right. And the Biden campaign needs a lot of those latter type of people to come out
*  and vote for him and to stop Donald Trump.
*  And I think what you're going to see over the course of the year is an intense amount
*  of messaging to tell people that the stakes of the election are to stop Donald Trump
*  and all that that entails.
*  And so things like abortion and health care and democracy and all of these other issues
*  will get folded under that umbrella of stopping Donald Trump.
*  And that is what they're going to push and try to impress upon people that that's the choice
*  in this election is between a return to Donald Trump and the chaos that he brought
*  and the relative stability, even if people are deeply unhappy about it that they have with Joe Biden.
*  Reed, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Tuesday, the president of Harvard University, Claudine Gay, announced her resignation
*  after a series of accusations of plagiarism in her scholarly work.
*  Her tenure, which began in July, was the shortest of any president in the history of the university.
*  Support for her new presidency eroded in December after Gay gave what critics saw as
*  lawyerly evasive answers at a congressional hearing about anti-Semitism on college campuses.
*  Gay was Harvard's first black president and the second woman to lead the institution.
*  And at least 55 people were killed in a powerful earthquake that struck Western Japan on New Year's Day.
*  The quake, which registered 7.6 on the Japanese seismic intensity scale, left widespread destruction.
*  Nearly 60,000 people fled their homes.
*  And on Tuesday, the authorities were continuing to search for people under the rubble.
*  Today's episode was produced by Mary Wilson and Eric Krupke.
*  It was edited by Devin Taylor with help from Rachel Quester and Paige Cowitt, contains original music by
*  Marion Lozano, Rowan Niemesto, Diane Wong, and Will Reed, and was engineered by Alyssa Moxley.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landsvark of Wonderly.
*  That's it for the Daily. I'm Sabrina Tavernisi. See you tomorrow.
