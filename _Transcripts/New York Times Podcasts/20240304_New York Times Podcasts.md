*  Let's see if we can do this.
*  Do you want to hear some of what I thought about it?
*  I would like to hear your thoughts on this episode.
*  Yeah.
*  I think this is a story about what happens when intelligence and politics are braided
*  together.
*  And it's a story about sources, whose sources are and how truthful they are and how
*  much they can be trusted.
*  And intelligence is not really what it sounds like.
*  Intelligence is the raw information, claims, mutterings that the intelligence community
*  collects as it tries to understand the world.
*  The problem with intelligence is that it's really alluring.
*  And this is a story about what happens when intelligence, this thing that should be
*  closely guarded and used by government officials to make decisions, is harnessed by politicians
*  for their political ends.
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro.
*  This is the Daily.
*  Today, Mike Schmidt, on how a single piece of unverified intelligence became the centerpiece
*  of a Republican attempt to impeach President Biden.
*  And what happened once that intelligence was discredited?
*  It's Monday, March 4th.
*  So Mike, if this is a story about a piece of intelligence and its journey through our
*  government, I think we should start there with the piece of intelligence and the story behind
*  it.
*  As you probably remember, heading into the 2020 election, Donald Trump rightly identified
*  Joe Biden as his biggest political problem.
*  He dispatched his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to dig up dirt on the Biden family.
*  Giuliani went to Ukraine.
*  He met with these officials and figures there.
*  And he came back and is basically like Joe Biden's sons corrupt and Joe Biden is part
*  of it.
*  And made such a fuss that the Attorney General Bill Barr eventually asked a United States
*  Attorney in Pennsylvania to essentially just deal with Rudy.
*  Listen to what Rudy has to say, find out if any of it is true and if it is pass it along
*  to the investigators who should look at it.
*  I remember all this.
*  It was not about Hunter Biden so much as tying Joe Biden his father to his son's alleged
*  corruption.
*  Exactly.
*  And what we didn't know at the time was that the US Attorney's investigators went back
*  and looked through government files and they see that years earlier, an FBI informant told
*  his handler that he had a contact at the Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, where Joe Biden's
*  son Hunter was on the board.
*  On the board and very well paid.
*  Correct.
*  So that US Attorney asks that the FBI handler go back and ask the informant what he knows
*  about Hunter Biden.
*  And in response, the informant makes a very salacious allegation.
*  Which is what?
*  He says that Hunter Biden and his father each took five million dollars in bribes from
*  Burisma.
*  And in exchange for that money, Joe Biden in his position as vice president at the time
*  would protect Burisma from corruption investigations by a Ukrainian prosecutor.
*  In other words, Joe Biden took a politically motivated bribe.
*  So this is the moment when this piece of intelligence we're talking about in this episode is born.
*  And it's a bombshell that a senior American elected official former vice president has gone
*  rogue and taken money from a foreign company asking him to protect it.
*  I mean, genuinely shocking.
*  Well, it's potentially a bombshell or it's one person telling his FBI handler something
*  he says he heard.
*  It's what one informant relayed to the FBI.
*  And this is really important.
*  What we're looking at in this case is not some polished product that's been vetted and
*  analyzed and put into the presidential daily briefing.
*  What we're talking about in this case is information at the bottom rung of the ladder for the intelligence
*  community.
*  This is raw source reporting that rolls into the country's law enforcement and intelligence
*  agencies from its sources and informants.
*  It's something more akin to rumor than a corroborated piece of intel got it.
*  So what ends up happening to this piece of intelligence?
*  What happens is that that US attorney who was sifting through these allegations about
*  Hunter Biden closes his inquiry and sends the bribery allegation information to another
*  United States attorney in Delaware who was investigating whether Hunter Biden should
*  be charged for his taxes, his purchase of a gun and his foreign business dealings.
*  And this is a big black hole in the story.
*  We don't know what happens with this information other than the fact that it sits in the FBI's
*  files.
*  And then Biden wins the presidency and Republicans who want to take down the president and are
*  still seeking revenge from the two impeachments of Trump want to find a link between Joe
*  and his son.
*  But they can't.
*  And that's the case for three long years until late last spring.
*  Senator from Iowa.
*  When Chuck Grassley, the senator from Iowa goes to the floor.
*  Thank you, Mr. President.
*  In multiple speeches, he says that whistleblowers have approached his office to tell him that
*  the FBI has very damaging allegations on the Biden family.
*  The allegations my office has received are very precise, very direct and very consistent.
*  Grassley says that this information is documented in a form that the FBI uses all the time.
*  Called a 1023.
*  The 1023 that I sought from the FBI references a criminal scheme involving then vice president
*  Biden and his alleged receipt of five million dollars.
*  He says that politics has infected the Bureau and that this information.
*  The FBI believes the source to be credible.
*  Which was given to the FBI by a trusted informant.
*  It's not being investigated.
*  Did the FBI follow normal investigating processes and procedures or did they just sweep this
*  under the rug?
*  And Congress and the American people need to see what this document says.
*  Quit playing games and recognize who you work for.
*  You're not working to protect the corporate interests of the FBI.
*  You're working for the American people.
*  Are you?
*  And almost on cue.
*  The conservative media goes nuts with it.
*  One of the FBI's top informants reported an allegation that Joe Biden took a five million
*  dollar bribe from a foreign national in exchange for a policy decision.
*  This was not just any confidential human source, by the way.
*  It seems like that source was highly valued.
*  The new question is this.
*  Is Joe Biden still making good on the bribe?
*  And we know the Democrat Party simply doesn't care if Joe Biden took millions and bribes.
*  There is no set of evidence that will ever be strong enough ever to get them to say enough.
*  So as Grassley is making these claims,
*  he and his allies in the house, subpoena the document from the FBI.
*  There's a whole back and forth as the FBI warns Congress.
*  Look, this is unverified information that we have in our files.
*  We're not just going to hand this over to you, right?
*  But the Republicans keep the pressure on the FBI.
*  They threaten to hold the FBI director Chris Ray in contempt.
*  If he doesn't give them the document,
*  and in the face of that, Ray allows Congress to see a redacted copy of the document
*  that shows what the informant told the handler.
*  This feels like an important moment because this is the FBI taking unverified intelligence
*  and allowing it to enter the political sphere.
*  I mean, let's be honest, the people demanding this document are not members of the House Intelligence Committee
*  trying to better understand U.S. Ukraine relations.
*  They are pretty far right conservatives who are openly seeking to find evidence against the president.
*  And are doing this at the same time that the FBI saying,
*  look, all this document does is show what an informant told a handler.
*  It shouldn't be seen as anything more than that.
*  Okay.
*  So what happens once these congressional Republicans get a glimpse of this document?
*  They come out in like a aha moment and say, we've got Joe Biden connected to his son's corruption.
*  This is the biggest political corruption scandal not only in my lifetime,
*  but I would say the past 100 years.
*  The evidence is overwhelming.
*  I'm not talking about Republican partisan witnesses from some far right wing conspiracy.
*  We're talking about FBI informants trusted FBI informants coming forth.
*  And by September, with this bribery allegation as the centerpiece.
*  That's why today I am directing our House Committee to open a formal impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.
*  Republicans move ahead with an impeachment inquiry into the president.
*  The American people deserve to know that the public offices are not for sale.
*  And that the federal government is not being used to cover up the actions of a politically associated family.
*  And it's important to know that beyond this bribery allegation,
*  the Republicans don't have much.
*  We will go wherever the evidence takes us.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So with the stakes of this rising by the moment we're now talking impeachment in the House,
*  how might do we come to understand that this salacious bombshell claim was not in fact true?
*  So in the wake of the Republicans kicking up all this stuff about the allegation that US Attorney in Delaware
*  finally goes and investigates takes that allegation of bribery that perhaps has been sitting around his office and says,
*  I'm going to figure out whether this is real correct.
*  So working with the US attorney, the FBI handler goes back to the informant to talk about the allegation,
*  to see what else is there.
*  Okay.
*  And the Justice Department starts to have doubts about the accuracy of his story.
*  Why? What explains that?
*  Well, let me tell you a little bit about who the informant is.
*  Okay.
*  The informant is a guy in his early 40s named Alexander Smyrenov.
*  He's been living in the US and he's been an FBI informant for over a decade.
*  In that role, he's provided information to the Bureau that led to criminal investigations.
*  And even more, he's received special dispensation from the FBI
*  to go out and conduct criminal activity as he gets information for the Bureau.
*  Okay. So he is a valuable source.
*  Why does the Justice Department suddenly have doubts about him?
*  Because his story is not holding up to scrutiny.
*  Smyrenov had said that he learned about the allegation in 2015 or 2016.
*  But he actually hadn't been talking to anyone at Burisma until 2017.
*  After Joe Biden had left office as vice president, he also said he saw footage of Hunter Biden
*  entering a hotel in Ukraine and that there were audio recordings of Hunter talking about
*  the bribe.
*  But Hunter hadn't been to Ukraine at that point.
*  So these inconsistencies were really alarming to the FBI.
*  And on top of that, the informant is telling his handler about how much he doesn't like
*  Joe Biden and how much Joe Biden's ties to Ukraine are going to take down his presidency.
*  And perhaps even more troublingly, the informant tells the FBI that he's recently been in touch
*  with Russian intelligence officials who have been feeding him their own information, including
*  some on Hunter Biden.
*  In other words, the informant might be a Russian asset, might be doing the bidding of the Russian
*  government, which has a long history of trying to feed misinformation into the American political
*  system.
*  We learned that, of course, in 2016.
*  Correct.
*  So ultimately, Mike, what conclusion does the FBI and this US attorney draw about this
*  informant when they go back and start finding all these inconsistencies and problems that
*  he can't be trusted about anything and that he fabricated the bribery claim?
*  We learn all this because something extraordinary and unusual happens.
*  The Justice Department, just a couple of weeks ago, indites the informant for lying to
*  the FBI and now he's sitting in jail awaiting trial.
*  Hmm.
*  You said that arresting this informant was unusual.
*  So why does the US government charge the informant?
*  What's unique here is that the government usually doesn't charge informant.
*  The informants are not nuns and priests.
*  They're people that are playing in the dirty parts of the world.
*  Sometimes they tell the truth, sometimes they shade it, sometimes they make things up.
*  And in that, at times are really important kernels that the US government has to learn
*  about.
*  And if you charge informants, you're going to deter other informants from talking to the
*  Bureau because they know, oh man, if I make a mistake, I to make it charge myself.
*  So should we understand the fact that the government charges this informant as perhaps
*  a measure of just how offended they were by the nature of the lies he told and based
*  on the fact that it contributes to an impeachment inquiry, the oversized impact that it had.
*  I don't know, but I think you might be right.
*  This is something that was weaponized by a political party and used essentially as the center
*  piece of an impeachment inquiry.
*  And the weight of that lie, the importance of it was more than just your average allegation.
*  And I don't know that that is the reason that they did this, but certainly it's hard to
*  not think that it contributed to it in some way.
*  Mike, I think it's worth just pausing and reflecting on what you just told us because what
*  the journey of this piece of intelligence tells us is that House Republicans and to a degree
*  Senate Republicans Chuck Grassley took a single strand of raw intelligence that they had
*  been told was never verified and they ran with it in the biggest way possible.
*  They made it a centerpiece of their efforts to link a sitting president with the foreign
*  business dealings of his son, claimed a represented corruption and they made it the centerpiece
*  of their efforts to impeach Joe Biden.
*  And now we know that the government regards that information as a fabrication and the
*  informant who delivered it as a serial liar.
*  That's a pretty remarkable story.
*  It's extraordinary and it's also not how the system is supposed to work.
*  Intelligence is not supposed to be harnessed by politicians to knock off their enemies.
*  It's supposed to be there to inform decision makers as they look at this crazy, big, confusing
*  world and try to make the right call.
*  Right.
*  So like you said, in every way, this seems to be a case study of how intelligence is not
*  properly handled in our system.
*  And I wonder, therefore, what the larger lesson of this is.
*  I mean, is it about picking better informants?
*  Is it about running intelligence down better, making sure you figure out if something's true
*  and don't just lock it away in a file cabinet?
*  Is it about never giving it to lawmakers who could abuse it?
*  I mean, what is the meaning of this story?
*  I think it's about being humble to the fact that just because one person said something
*  doesn't necessarily mean it's true.
*  And that when we hear things, that there's a bit of skepticism that not everything that
*  is recorded by the government or said publicly is true.
*  And that we have to have some humility to the fact that this is a really, really complex,
*  crazy world.
*  And not every disclosure answers the major questions of the moment.
*  And I think that in a time where there's a ton of uncertainty, people grasp for these
*  things and they try to use them to make their point, but at the end of the day, it may
*  not be true.
*  So that, of course, brings us to the question of where this all leaves this impeachment
*  inquiry.
*  I mean, the foundation of it, the missing link, the alleged smoking gun evaporates and
*  its source is branded a serial liar and fabricated by the US government.
*  Does that kneecap the Republicans impeachment process?
*  The hardline Republicans have said this indictment, it's just the next part of the cover-up.
*  It's just the next way that the FBI is doing the bidding of the Biden crime family.
*  So you're saying many of the Republicans who first relied on this now false intelligence
*  are undeterred by the fact that it has been branded fake by the government and are now
*  also claiming that this allegation was not that central to the impeachment inquiry.
*  But it was, correct.
*  If you are a foreign government who wishes America ill, if you are a Russia, you have to
*  be watching all this and kind of licking your chops, right?
*  I mean, whether or not Russia fed this informant misinformation about a bribe involving Hunter
*  and Joe Biden, the journey of this piece of intelligence suggests that feeding misinformation
*  into our system is still a very reliable way to wreak havoc in the United States political
*  system.
*  It's not the first time we've learned that lesson, but it's an incredibly vivid example
*  that it still could do a tremendous amount of damage.
*  It almost seems too easy for our adversaries.
*  You think of intelligence operations as these really complex things that involve gadgets
*  and double agents, but to get the United States ramped up and huffing and puffing and impeaching
*  its president, you really just need to feed one side something that fits their narrative.
*  Right.
*  Put out the window.
*  Well, Mike, thank you very much.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  We'll break back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Over the weekend, Donald Trump won three more nominating contests in Michigan, Missouri,
*  and Idaho, doubling his delegate count and making clear that his last remaining rival, Nikki
*  Haley, has no real path forward.
*  So far, Haley has won just a single primary, the District of Columbia.
*  Trump is expected to officially clinch the Republican nomination by the end of the month.
*  Lebron dribbles at Porter, sizes him up 360 spin to the rim, and in, there it is, 40,000.
*  Lebron makes history.
*  Lebron James has become the first player in NBA history to score 40,000 career points
*  after making a left hand layup during the LA Lakers matchup against the Denver Nuggets
*  on Saturday.
*  The milestone may help to settle a long-running debate over who is the greatest NBA player
*  of all time.
*  James, the Times Road, is now, quote, all by himself in the annals of basketball history.
