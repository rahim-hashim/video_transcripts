# An F.B.I. Informant, a Bombshell Claim, and an Impeachment Built on a Lie
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFh7ORWhOP4)
*  Let's see if we can do this.
*  Do you want to hear some of what I thought about it?
*  I would like to hear that.
*  I'd like to hear your thoughts on this episode.
*  Yeah.
*  I think this is a story about what happens when intelligence and politics are braided
*  together.
*  And it's a story about sources, who sources are and how truthful they are and how much
*  they can be trusted.
*  And intelligence is not really what it sounds like.
*  Intelligence is the raw information, claims, mutterings that the intelligence community
*  collects as it tries to understand the world.
*  The problem with intelligence is that it's really alluring.
*  And this is a story about what happens when intelligence, this thing that should be closely
*  guarded and used by government officials to make decisions, is harnessed by politicians
*  for their political ends.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, Mike Schmidt on how a single piece of unverified intelligence became the centerpiece
*  of a Republican attempt to impeach President Biden and what happened once that intelligence
*  was discredited.
*  It's Monday, March 4th.
*  So Mike, if this is a story about a piece of intelligence and its journey through our
*  government, I think we should start there with the piece of intelligence and the story
*  behind it.
*  As you probably remember, heading into the 2020 election, Donald Trump rightly identified
*  Joe Biden as his biggest political problem, and he dispatched his personal lawyer, Rudy
*  Giuliani, to dig up dirt on the Biden family.
*  Giuliani went to Ukraine.
*  He met with these officials and figures there, and he came back and is basically like, Joe
*  Biden's son's corrupt and Joe Biden is part of it, and made such a fuss that the attorney
*  general, Bill Barr, eventually asked a United States attorney in Pennsylvania to essentially
*  just deal with Rudy.
*  Listen to what Rudy has to say, find out if any of it is true, and if it is, pass it along
*  to the investigators who should look at it.
*  I remember all this.
*  It was not about Hunter Biden so much as tying Joe Biden, his father, to his son's alleged
*  corruption.
*  Exactly.
*  And what we didn't know at the time was that the US attorney's investigators went back
*  and looked through government files, and they see that years earlier, an FBI informant told
*  his handler that he had a contact at the Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, where Joe Biden's
*  son, Hunter, was on the board.
*  On the board and very well paid.
*  Correct.
*  So that US attorney asks that the FBI handler go back and ask the informant what he knows
*  about Hunter Biden, and in response, the informant makes a very salacious allegation.
*  Which is what?
*  He says that Hunter Biden and his father each took $5 million in bribes from Burisma, and
*  in exchange for that money, Joe Biden, in his position as vice president at the time,
*  would protect Burisma from corruption investigations by a Ukrainian prosecutor.
*  In other words, Joe Biden took a politically motivated bribe.
*  So this is the moment when this piece of intelligence we're talking about in this episode is born,
*  And it's a bombshell that a senior American elected official, former vice president, has
*  gone rogue and taken money from a foreign company asking him to protect it.
*  I mean, a genuinely shocking claim.
*  Well, it's potentially a bombshell, or it's one person telling his FBI handler something
*  he says he heard.
*  It's what one informant relayed to the FBI.
*  And this is really important.
*  What we're looking at in this case is not some polished product that's been vetted and
*  analyzed and put into the presidential daily briefing.
*  What we're talking about in this case is information at the bottom rung of the ladder for the intelligence
*  community.
*  This is raw source reporting that rolls into the country's law enforcement and intelligence
*  agencies from its sources and informants.
*  It's something more akin to rumor than a corroborated piece of intel.
*  Got it.
*  So what ends up happening to this piece of intelligence?
*  What happens is that that US attorney who was sifting through these allegations about
*  Hunter Biden closes his inquiry and sends the bribery allegation information to another
*  United States attorney in Delaware who was investigating whether Hunter Biden should
*  be charged for his taxes, his purchase of a gun and his foreign business dealings.
*  And this is a big black hole in the story.
*  We don't know what happens with this information other than the fact that it sits in the FBI's
*  files.
*  And then Biden wins the presidency and Republicans who want to take down the president and are
*  still seeking revenge from the two impeachments of Trump want to find a link between Joe and
*  his son.
*  But they can't.
*  And that's the case for three long years.
*  Until late last spring.
*  Senator from Iowa.
*  When Chuck Grassley, the senator from Iowa, goes to the floor.
*  Thank you, Mr. President.
*  And in multiple speeches, he says that whistleblowers have approached his office to tell him that
*  the FBI has very damaging allegations on the Biden family.
*  The allegations my office has received are very precise, very direct and very consistent.
*  Grassley says that this information is documented in a form that the FBI uses all the time called
*  the 1023.
*  The 1023 that I sought from the FBI references a criminal scheme involving then Vice President
*  Biden and his alleged receipt of five million dollars.
*  He says that politics has infected the bureau and that this information.
*  The FBI believes the source to be credible.
*  Which was given to the FBI by a trusted informant.
*  It's not being investigated.
*  Did the FBI follow normal investigating processes and procedures or did they just sweep this
*  under the rug?
*  And Congress and the American people need to see what this document says.
*  You're playing games and recognize who you work for.
*  You're not working to protect the corporate interests of the FBI.
*  You're working for the American people.
*  A yield.
*  And almost on cue.
*  The conservative media goes nuts with it.
*  One of the FBI's top informants reported an allegation that Joe Biden took a five million
*  dollar bribe from a foreign national in exchange for a policy decision.
*  This was not just any confidential human source, by the way.
*  It seems like that source was highly valued.
*  The new question is this.
*  Is Joe Biden still making good on the bribe?
*  And we know the Democrat Party simply doesn't care if Joe Biden took millions in bribes.
*  There is no set of evidence that will ever be strong enough ever to get them to say enough.
*  So as Grassley is making these claims, he and his allies in the House subpoena the document
*  from the FBI.
*  There's a whole back and forth.
*  As the FBI warns Congress, look, this is unverified information that we have in our files.
*  We're not just going to hand this over to you.
*  But the Republicans keep the pressure on the FBI.
*  They threaten to hold the FBI director, Chris Wray, in contempt.
*  If he doesn't give them the document.
*  And in the face of that, Wray allows Congress to see a redacted copy of the document that
*  shows what the informant told the handler.
*  This feels like an important moment because this is the FBI taking unverified intelligence
*  and allowing it to enter the political sphere.
*  Let's be honest, the people demanding this document are not members of the House Intelligence
*  Committee trying to better understand U.S.-Ukraine relations.
*  They are pretty far right conservatives who are openly seeking to find evidence against
*  the president.
*  And are doing this at the same time that the FBI is saying, look, all this document does
*  is show what an informant told a handler.
*  It shouldn't be seen as anything more than that.
*  Okay.
*  So what happens once these congressional Republicans get a glimpse of this document?
*  They come out in like a aha moment and say, we've got Joe Biden connected to his son's
*  corruption.
*  This is the biggest political corruption scandal, not only in my lifetime, but I would say the
*  past 100 years.
*  The evidence is overwhelming.
*  We're not talking about Republican partisan witnesses from some far right wing conspiracy.
*  We're talking about FBI informants, trusted FBI informants coming forth.
*  And by September, with this bribery allegation as the centerpiece.
*  That's why today I am directing our House Committee to open a formal impeachment inquiry
*  into President Joe Biden.
*  Republicans move ahead with an impeachment inquiry into the president.
*  The American people deserve to know that the public offices are not for sale and that the
*  federal government is not being used to cover up the actions of a politically associated
*  family.
*  And it's important to note that beyond this bribery allegation, the Republicans don't
*  have much.
*  We will go wherever the evidence takes us.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So with the stakes of this rising by the moment, we're now talking impeachment in the House.
*  How might do we come to understand that this salacious bombshell claim was not in fact
*  true?
*  So in the wake of the Republicans kicking up all this stuff about the allegation, that
*  US attorney in Delaware finally goes and investigates it.
*  Takes that allegation of bribery that perhaps has been sitting around his office and says,
*  I'm going to figure out whether this is real.
*  Correct.
*  So working with the US attorney, the FBI handler goes back to the informant to talk about the
*  allegation, to see what else is there.
*  And the Justice Department starts to have doubts about the accuracy of his story.
*  Why?
*  What explains that?
*  Well, let me tell you a little bit about who the informant is.
*  The informant is a guy in his early 40s named Alexander Smirnoff.
*  He's been living in the US and he's been an FBI informant for over a decade.
*  In that role, he's provided information to the Bureau that led to criminal investigations
*  and even more, he's received special dispensation from the FBI to go out and conduct criminal
*  activity as he gets information for the Bureau.
*  Okay, so he is a valuable source.
*  Why does the Justice Department suddenly have doubts about him?
*  Because his story is not holding up to scrutiny.
*  Smirnoff had said that he learned about the allegation in 2015 or 2016.
*  But he actually hadn't been talking to anyone at Burisma until 2017, after Joe Biden had
*  left office as vice president.
*  He also said he saw footage of Hunter Biden entering a hotel in Ukraine and that there
*  were audio recordings of Hunter talking about the bribe.
*  But Hunter hadn't been to Ukraine at that point.
*  So these inconsistencies were really alarming to the FBI.
*  On top of that, the informant is telling his handler about how much he doesn't like Joe
*  Biden and how much Joe Biden's ties to Ukraine are going to take down his presidency.
*  Perhaps even more troublingly, the informant tells the FBI that he's recently been in
*  touch with Russian intelligence officials who have been feeding him their own information,
*  including some on Hunter Biden.
*  In other words, the informant might be a Russian asset, might be doing the bidding of the Russian
*  government, which has a long history of trying to feed misinformation into the American political
*  system.
*  We learned that, of course, in 2016.
*  Correct.
*  So ultimately, Mike, what conclusion does the FBI and this US attorney draw about this
*  informant when they go back and start finding all these inconsistencies and problems?
*  That he can't be trusted about anything and that he fabricated the bribery claim.
*  We learn all this because something extraordinary and unusual happens.
*  The Justice Department just a couple of weeks ago indicts the informant for lying to the
*  FBI and now he's sitting in jail awaiting trial.
*  You said that arresting this informant was unusual.
*  So why does the US government charge the informant?
*  What's unique here is that the government usually doesn't charge informants.
*  Informants are not nuns and priests.
*  They're people that are playing in the dirty parts of the world.
*  Sometimes they tell the truth, sometimes they shade it, sometimes they make things up.
*  And in that, at times, are really important kernels that the US government has to learn
*  about.
*  And if you charge informants, you're going to deter other informants from talking to
*  the Bureau because they know, oh man, if I make a mistake, I too make it charge myself.
*  So should we understand the fact that the government charges this informant as perhaps
*  a measure of just how offended they were by the nature of the lies he told and based on
*  the fact that it contributes to an impeachment inquiry, the oversized impact that it had.
*  I don't know, but I think you might be right.
*  This is something that was weaponized by a political party and used essentially as the
*  centerpiece of an impeachment inquiry.
*  And the weight of that lie, the importance of it was more than just your average allegation.
*  And I don't know that that is the reason that they did this, but certainly it's hard to
*  not think that it contributed to it in some way.
*  Mike, I think it's worth just pausing and reflecting on what you just told us.
*  Because what the journey of this piece of intelligence tells us is that House Republicans
*  and to a degree Senate Republicans, Chuck Grassley took a single strand of raw intelligence
*  that they had been told was never verified and they ran with it in the biggest way possible.
*  They made it a centerpiece of their efforts to link a sitting president with the foreign
*  business dealings of his son, claimed it represented corruption, and they made it the centerpiece
*  of their efforts to impeach Joe Biden.
*  And now we know that the government regards that information as a fabrication and the
*  informant who delivered it as a serial liar.
*  That's a pretty remarkable story.
*  It's extraordinary.
*  And it's also not how the system is supposed to work.
*  Intelligence is not supposed to be harnessed by politicians to knock off their enemies.
*  It's supposed to be there to inform decision makers as they look at this crazy, big, confusing
*  world and try to make the right call.
*  Right.
*  So like you said, in every way, this seems to be a case study of how intelligence is
*  not properly handled in our system.
*  And I wonder, therefore, what the larger lesson of this is.
*  Is it about picking better informants?
*  Is it about running intelligence down better, making sure you figure out if something's
*  true and don't just lock it away in a file cabinet?
*  Is it about never giving it to lawmakers who could abuse it?
*  What is the meaning of this story?
*  I think it's about being humble to the fact that just because one person said something
*  doesn't necessarily mean it's true.
*  And that when we hear things, that there's a bit of skepticism that not everything that
*  is recorded by the government or said publicly is true.
*  And that we have to have some humility to the fact that this is a really, really complex,
*  crazy world and not every disclosure answers the major questions of the moment.
*  And I think that in a time where there's a ton of uncertainty, people grasp for these
*  things and they try to use them to make their point.
*  But at the end of the day, it may not be true.
*  So that, of course, brings us to the question of where this all leaves this impeachment
*  inquiry.
*  The hardline Republicans have said, this indictment, it's just the next part of the cover-up.
*  It's just the next way that the FBI is doing the bidding of the Biden crime family.
*  So you're saying many of the Republicans who first relied on this now false intelligence
*  are undeterred by the fact that it has been branded fake by the government?
*  And are now also claiming that this allegation was not that central to the impeachment inquiry.
*  But it was.
*  Correct.
*  If you are a foreign government who wishes America ill, if you are Russia, you have to
*  be watching all this and kind of licking your chops, right?
*  I mean, whether or not Russia fed this informant misinformation about a bribe involving Hunter
*  and Joe Biden, the journey of this piece of intelligence suggests that feeding misinformation
*  system is still a very reliable way to wreak havoc in the United States political system.
*  It's not the first time we've learned that lesson, but it's an incredibly vivid example
*  that it still could do a tremendous amount of damage.
*  It almost seems too easy for our adversaries.
*  You think of intelligence operations as these really complex things that involve gadgets
*  and double agents, but to get the United States ramped up and huffing and puffing.
*  And impeaching its president?
*  You really just need to feed one side something that fits their narrative.
*  Right.
*  And they follow it out the window.
*  Well, Mike, thank you very much.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Over the weekend, Donald Trump won three more nominating contests in Michigan, Missouri,
*  and Idaho, doubling his delegate count and making clear that his last remaining rival,
*  Nikki Haley, has no real path forward.
*  So far, Haley has won just a single primary, the District of Columbia.
*  Trump is expected to officially clinch the Republican nomination by the end of the month.
*  LeBron dribbles at Porter, sizes him up, 360, spin to the rim, head in, there it is, 40,000.
*  LeBron makes history.
*  LeBron James has become the first player in NBA history to score 40,000 career points
*  after making a left-hand layup during the L.A. Lakers' matchup against the Denver Nuggets
*  on Saturday.
*  The milestone may help to settle a long-running debate over who is the greatest NBA player
*  of all time.
