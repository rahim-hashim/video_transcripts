# 'The Interview': Charlamagne Tha God Wonâ€™t Take Sides
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZdpv-MmwHs)
*  Hi, everyone.
*  Sabrina here.
*  Just popping in to remind you, every weekend on Saturday, we're going to be sending you
*  episodes of a new show our colleagues are making.
*  The show is called The Interview.
*  This week, Lulu Garcia Navarro talks with radio host Charlemagne the God.
*  Okay, here's the show.
*  From The New York Times, this is The Interview.
*  I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro.
*  I interview a lot of politicians, and I'll be honest, I'm jealous of how many of them
*  want to talk to Charlemagne the God.
*  As the co-host of the wildly popular radio show, The Breakfast Club, Charlemagne, who
*  was born Leonard McKelvey, has become a go-to interviewer for politicians who want to reach
*  the show's largely black audience and who aren't afraid of a good, tough conversation.
*  This year, with polls showing Donald Trump's growing popularity with black male voters,
*  reaching that audience for candidates in both parties is more critical than ever.
*  The Breakfast Club has nearly 6 million listeners every month on the radio, plus the YouTube
*  channel, the podcast, and the clips from its interviews that regularly go viral.
*  Even if you've never listened to the show, you probably know about some of the more memorable
*  episodes, like in 2020 when then-candidate Joe Biden went on and dropped this line,
*  Even though Biden got huge blowback for that comment, Charlemagne endorsed the Democratic
*  ticket, but this time around, he said he won't endorse anyone.
*  That decision has led to some speculation about his personal politics.
*  It also made me curious about how he wants to wield his considerable influence and what
*  he thinks of the potential shift happening among black voters.
*  When we spoke, Charlemagne was getting ready to publish a new book, Get Honest or Die Lying,
*  Why Small Talk Sucks, and he had just come off a stint guest-hosting The Daily Show,
*  where some of his comments got a lot of attention.
*  Here's my conversation with Charlemagne the God.
*  Your new book is about small talk and how you think it's bad.
*  So I want to start with some big issues.
*  Let's get right to it.
*  Let's get right to it.
*  We know what we're here for.
*  We know what we're here for.
*  Exactly.
*  You just went on The Daily Show and you went after DEI initiatives.
*  That's diversity, equity, and inclusion.
*  You said it's mostly garbage, it's a PR stunt, and you said it makes things worse for black
*  people because of the backlash effect.
*  Can you just tell me a little bit about why you wanted to take that on in particular?
*  I don't have a problem with DEI.
*  I was talking about corporate DEI initiatives that were created after George Floyd, those
*  issues that were more symbolism over substance, those corporations that pledged all of this
*  money to different black initiatives and nobody ever saw any of that money.
*  I'm talking about the corporations who do things like putting a Simone Biles poster
*  in the break room and saying something like, we're head over heroes for diversity here.
*  That's the kind of DEI initiatives I were talking about.
*  I'm not talking about DEI overall.
*  It's so interesting to me because I love what the right wing media does.
*  I was about to say, you got widely celebrated for this.
*  I actually first saw this on Fox News.
*  They do that on purpose because they won't listen to 95%, 99% of anything I'll say, but
*  they'll take that one line and say Charlemagne to God says DEI is mostly garbage.
*  And then what happens, people on the left, instead of actually going to listen to what
*  I actually said, they just respond to the narrative that was created by right wing media.
*  So now you got people on the left attacking me and attacking a narrative that really is
*  nothing.
*  So then why wade into these waters?
*  You know the DEI is at the center of a huge cultural battle.
*  You know that this is one of the right's main talking points.
*  They think that DEI is indoctrination.
*  So then why go on The Daily Show and choose to like...
*  Because it sparks good conversation and it's a conversation that we need to have.
*  Maybe I just want DEI and the corporate work environments to be better.
*  I can be sitting in a corporate boardroom and be hearing all of this stuff in a sensitivity
*  training meeting and I'm like this isn't even for me.
*  So this is based on your personal experience of sitting in these meetings.
*  Absolutely.
*  We take these tests at iHeartRadio and you got to answer certain questions and you know
*  what that's about.
*  But my biggest issue with corporate DEI is literally just the performativeness of it
*  all.
*  Especially when we're talking about the money that was pledged by all of these different
*  corporations that nobody ever saw.
*  So there was a lot of backlash to this.
*  And a lot of people who agreed.
*  And a lot of people who agreed.
*  And not just people on the right.
*  But what I found interesting about all the comments is this thing that happens with you
*  a lot which is people wondering as they have for a while what is Charlemagne the God all
*  about?
*  Where does he stand politically?
*  That's so funny you say that.
*  I promise you as I was walking in here this white guy stops me in the street.
*  He had on glasses, some khakis, a sweater and he goes, you're Charlemagne right?
*  And I go yeah.
*  And he goes man I like when you talk politics.
*  And he goes man I think that it's going to be a civil war in this country.
*  He said that's what you need to talk about.
*  He said I don't care who wins.
*  He said I don't care if it's Trump.
*  I don't care if it's Biden.
*  I feel like it's going to be a civil war in this country.
*  And he goes what side are you on?
*  And I'm like I'm not on any side.
*  And I think that's the problem with American politics and just America period.
*  People think if me as a black man if I criticize Democrats then I'm supporting MAGA.
*  But if I criticize Donald Trump and Republicans then I'm a Democratic shill.
*  Why can't I just be a person who deals in nuance?
*  What happened to just being objective and seeing things on both sides because nothing
*  is all right and nothing is all wrong either?
*  Well I think what people would probably answer is that the rise of Trump has really polarized
*  people.
*  Absolutely.
*  And so to say oh I don't take a side some people especially on the left would say well
*  that's not right either.
*  Why?
*  I think we do ourselves a grave disservice by thinking I can't criticize Democrats and
*  I can't criticize Republicans and still know who I want to vote for in November in order
*  to preserve democracy.
*  I've been on every there's not a show I've been on when they asked me about Donald Trump
*  I say the same thing.
*  He's a threat to democracy.
*  He literally said let's suspend the Constitution to overthrow the results of an election.
*  You saw his lawyers in the court saying well he never he never agreed to support the Constitution.
*  He led an insurrection of this country on January 6th and people just act like you know it was
*  a bunch of you know kids wiling out at spring break in Miami.
*  I say these things over and over and over.
*  But if somebody like you know John Carl says to me well and this happens it's in the interview
*  you can watch it.
*  Well President Biden says these things too about Donald Trump.
*  Why don't you think it resonates?
*  And I say because he's an uninspiring candidate who doesn't have any main character energy.
*  The right will take that one clip and say Charlemagne says Joe Biden is an uninspiring
*  candidate who has no main character energy and once again everybody on the left attacks
*  that narrative instead of going to watch the interview and taking the narrative they should
*  be using which is Charlemagne says Donald Trump is a threat to democracy.
*  We are insane right now.
*  I blame the media so much for what's happening.
*  You are the media.
*  Yes but listen look at what I'm doing.
*  I'm being objective.
*  I tell people all the time if you lie to them about Democrats they won't believe you when
*  you tell them the truth about Republicans.
*  So why would I sit there and lie to people about the flaws I see in the Democratic Party?
*  Well you've asked why you should take a side publicly.
*  I think some people would say because you Charlemagne have a different responsibility
*  because you have this particular platform.
*  You know people your audience of millions do look to you because they respect you.
*  They listen to you.
*  You're not just some guy in a voting booth.
*  You're a guy who really does have an impact and they want to know what you think.
*  I'm telling them what I think.
*  Let's go back.
*  I actually want to ask you about your political evolution and how you came up.
*  Let's do it.
*  Did you think of politics at all when you were growing up?
*  Did you think about the way things were?
*  A hundred percent but you know my mind state at the time was a little bit different because
*  I grew up Jehovah's Witness.
*  So when you grow up Jehovah's Witness you don't vote.
*  That's not what they do.
*  They stay away from it.
*  But I also read a lot of books.
*  My mother was an English teacher.
*  She told me verbatim read things that don't pertain to you.
*  I read so many things when I was younger.
*  Everything from Judy Blume to Are You There Goddess Me Margaret to my dad giving me the
*  autobiography of Malcolm X.
*  But then you listen to Jay-Z saying things like back then he was saying things like government
*  we politic ourselves.
*  You know where I'm from in South Carolina.
*  We were all always aware of government but we had a different view of government back
*  then and that's like government will never work for us.
*  It'll never work for us because we're black.
*  So the only thing we could do is try to do for self.
*  But you know as I've grown older I realized like oh this politics thing can really influence
*  influence people in a real way.
*  You love South Carolina when you got your big break on the Wendy Williams experience.
*  You end up in New York.
*  You start the Breakfast Club in 2010.
*  What were you trying to do with the show then?
*  Same exact thing I'm trying to do now.
*  I've always said that you know the yin and the yang of life to me is ratchetness and
*  righteousness and so it's just like you know for every rapper that comes on the show who
*  you might look at and think you know this person is ratchet I try to bring the spiritual
*  leaders on the show.
*  I try to bring the authors on the show.
*  Not try.
*  I do.
*  First time I got on the air I think was like 99, 2000.
*  I've always done that.
*  You can go back to my track record when I was on the radio in Charleston, South Carolina,
*  Columbia, South Carolina, you know Philadelphia.
*  I was getting in trouble for bringing the mayor of Philly on my show.
*  I'll never forget it.
*  Mayor Nutter was the mayor of Philly at the time and there was something going on in Philly
*  where they were about to close all the libraries and all the rec centers and this was like
*  2010 when you know Philly was like really really on fire you know with crime and violence
*  right.
*  I remember it was on the front page of the paper that oh and they were going to cut a
*  lot of a lot of the police so they were going to cut a large part of the police closed rec
*  centers and like the libraries and people were freaking out because they knew what that
*  was going to do to the city and I remember Mayor Nutter came on the show to let everybody
*  know no everything is fine.
*  We got the money.
*  None of that is happening.
*  Cool.
*  I remember a radio consultant at the time literally said to me when the show was over
*  and I was in his office a radio consultant.
*  He goes you know yeah nobody really cares about the mayor.
*  I guess I guess you know people want to hear from like Beyonce and I said to him I said
*  yeah it's easy for you to say that because you don't live in Philadelphia.
*  White guy that didn't live in Philadelphia.
*  You don't live here.
*  So you flew in to listen to the radio to consult me on what I should be talking about to the
*  city of Philadelphia and you're going to fly back to wherever you're from and not even
*  care about what's going on in the city.
*  I was the mayor of Philadelphia talking about something that was a real concern to the people
*  of Philadelphia.
*  So that shows how out of touch a lot of these programmers and people that run these you
*  know media corporations are and I've always pushed against that grain.
*  I mean tell me where that comes from when you bring the mayor of Philadelphia on to
*  what is a popular culture show essentially.
*  What did you understand that you were up to?
*  I understood people.
*  I understood that you know my people black people people in hip hop we care more than
*  just things about hip hop.
*  There's never been a time where hip hop has not talked about things of socially redeeming
*  value like there's always been a Chuck D. There's always been a killer Mike.
*  I don't know why people think that you know black people are so one dimensional that you
*  can't bring an elected official on a hip hop radio station where so many people that are
*  directly affected by the things these elected officials are doing are listening.
*  Like why wouldn't my audience be receptive to that?
*  You know we talk about diversity right?
*  Like when we talk about the T.E.I. thing I feel like you know black people with our platforms
*  and just in society we have to be way more diverse than white people do because we have
*  to know what's going on with a little bit of everybody because we deal with a little
*  bit of everybody and we encounter a little bit of everybody.
*  It's easy to stay insulated in your bubble and just be around whiteness for the majority
*  of your life.
*  That's never been my experience.
*  So I don't understand why we can't do both and do it well.
*  The only way you can't do both and do it well is if you're not equipped and if you're being
*  realistic there are a lot of people who aren't equipped to talk to a Kodak black and a President
*  Biden.
*  That's a very unique skill set that probably comes from somebody who's black.
*  Does one help you prepare for the other?
*  I mean what is...
*  Hell yeah that's a great question.
*  I've never approached any conversation with fear and if you can stare down a so-called
*  gangster rapper who's got the whole crew in the studio, if I can ask those questions
*  to him I can damn sure ask these questions to an elected official.
*  Okay I'm really curious how you prepare for interviews like this because you know you
*  just had Mayor Eric Adams on.
*  That's right.
*  And it was a pretty wild interview.
*  I'm just curious about your choice to have him mostly interviewed by a former public
*  defender.
*  Ole Yemi O'Loren.
*  Ole Yemi O'Loren.
*  Yeah you can say Ole.
*  Okay so Ole came on to interview him.
*  First of all did Eric Adams know he was walking into an interview like that?
*  Meaning combative and with an activist?
*  Combative I don't think he thought he was walking into a combative interview but I think
*  people know the Breakfast Club.
*  I think that you know for the most part if you come on to Breakfast Club you're going
*  to get asked some like you know really tough questions.
*  He did not know that Ole was going to be there but we've been rotating even though we have
*  our new third co-host who is Jess Hilarious but you know all last year we rotated you
*  know guest hosts so I've been watching Ole you know for a long time and I like a lot
*  of the things that she talks about and I think that she you know challenges Mayor Eric Adams
*  in a real way.
*  I think she asked some real questions and you know we see the state of New York right
*  now.
*  New Yorkers have real questions about New York City.
*  You know is New York City safe?
*  The migrant issue is a real issue.
*  I felt like there was a lot of real high level conversations that needed to be had and I
*  thought Ole would be perfect for him and I thought she did a fantastic job and I thought
*  the Mayor did a fantastic job.
*  That made me like Mayor Adams even more because what I realized is it's something I always
*  knew about politicians.
*  He's just doing his best.
*  Like you got to think about what he inherited.
*  Like what we just came out of in regards to COVID and the hole that he's digging himself
*  out of.
*  So he's just really really attempting to do his best and I thought it was you know very
*  interesting to watch him not run from the tough questions, not duck, show real emotion.
*  Like I thought that that was a great conversation between a mayor of a major city and one of
*  his constituents.
*  Is that what you're hoping these moments will provide like just authenticity I guess?
*  Authenticity that leads to authentic information and great conversation that people can actually
*  learn from.
*  And you know even just from the feedback I've gotten from people like some people feel like
*  Ole might have been too tough on the mayor.
*  Some people feel like the mayor did a great job.
*  I don't think you can ever be too tough on an elected official.
*  I just don't.
*  Like they're an elected official.
*  They're there for a reason.
*  Like they wake up in the morning ready to be in the hot seat.
*  With that said, who do you decide that you want to go really hard on?
*  Because I've listened to some of your recent interviews with conservatives like Larry Elder,
*  Vivek Ramaswamy, Candice Owens, and they weren't nearly as combative.
*  That's not what the internet says.
*  Everybody else says other than Candice Owens, they felt like we was too hard on Larry Elder.
*  They felt like we was too hard on Vivek Ramaswamy.
*  The second conversation we had with Vivek Ramaswamy was more smooth.
*  That's the one I'm referencing.
*  But the reason that was more smooth is because he's not running for office anymore.
*  It's an inconsequential conversation.
*  You're not running for anything.
*  Candice Owens is not an elected official.
*  I think this right here shows me what's wrong with our country.
*  Wait, wait.
*  I'm interested in why you think that shows you what's wrong with this country.
*  But I have to be honest, like watching some of those interviews, I was wondering why there
*  wasn't more pushback on questionable assertions, including real misinformation.
*  You know, Larry Elder saying that the nuclear family was ruined by welfare or Vivek's great
*  replacement theory, you know, which he's been pushing, which is a racist theory that Democrats
*  are bringing in black and brown people to replace the white race.
*  We definitely pushed back on Larry Elder when he said the nuclear family.
*  Yeah, it was ruined by the welfare system being brought in.
*  In that conversation, Tesla and Figaro was on, and Tesla was definitely pushing back
*  on Larry.
*  Like people really don't.
*  And that was that's another thing, right?
*  But I guess it's like, where are you in this?
*  Like, what is your role?
*  Do you see yourself as a mediator?
*  This is your show.
*  Yeah, I mean, it depends.
*  Like, I'm listening a lot of times.
*  Like I don't approach any conversation like I want to have a confrontation.
*  But you go hard on on hip hop people.
*  I've seen you do that.
*  And they're not elected officials.
*  They're people with power.
*  Isn't it less about being an elected official and more about who has power?
*  It depends what you're doing with your power.
*  When you talk about hip hop, telling somebody that their music is whack.
*  That's really an inconsequential conversation.
*  That's not real power.
*  Mayor Adams has actual power.
*  Elected officials that are in those positions, they have real power.
*  What is me telling a rapper that their music is whack?
*  I don't think you're a good rapper.
*  Like how is that consequential to what's going on in our society?
*  I mean, if somebody already has an opinion that I don't agree with that, like, let's
*  just say it's an issue, right?
*  Like everybody was talking about, you know, things that Candice Owens has said in the
*  past.
*  If I already know her opinion on that, and I know we're not going to agree on that, what
*  would I be bringing it up for other than to be performative?
*  You have noted yourself that people come on to pander to your audience politically.
*  I mean, you had that conversation very virally with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
*  and presidential candidate in 2016.
*  Do you feel protective of your audience?
*  Yes, but I don't think, let me word just correctly, because I might see something later and be
*  like, eh, I was wrong.
*  But I don't think Democrats pander as much as they used to, at least when they come to
*  Breakfast Club, because they know when they come to Breakfast Club, even when they sit
*  down with me, we're going to have a real conversation.
*  I think that's why they continue to come.
*  Like somebody like Secretary Pete.
*  Secretary Pete has not stopped coming to Breakfast Club.
*  Pete Buttigieg, Secretary of Transportation.
*  I tell Pete that every time he comes.
*  And the reason I tell Pete that every time he comes is because a lot of these people
*  only like to come around when it's election season.
*  And that's when it really looks like pandering.
*  That's when it really looks like dream selling.
*  And by the way, it should be.
*  You should be trying to sell us something.
*  You should be trying to encourage us to go out there and vote for you.
*  Yeah, cut more student loan debt.
*  Do those things.
*  Yeah, pardon more people who are in prison on a federal level for marijuana, you know,
*  nonviolent drug offenses.
*  Yeah, continue to do that, especially in an election year.
*  And let's push for more of that.
*  But guys like Secretary Pete, they've been coming for the last four years.
*  That says something to me.
*  And I definitely know it says something to our audience.
*  And so I respect him for that.
*  You brought it up.
*  It's election season.
*  A lot has been made of these polls showing black support for the Democrats cratering.
*  You've been asked about this a lot.
*  I'm just wondering what you're thinking as more and more of these polls keep showing
*  the same thing.
*  I think, you know, you might see a slight uptick in black people voting for Trump this
*  year, but I think it's overstated.
*  I think they said the numbers like 22%.
*  I don't think that 22% of black people are going to vote for Donald Trump.
*  I think the biggest thing that people are going to have to fight against this year is
*  the couch.
*  And that's what I've been saying.
*  I keep saying it over and over.
*  Like, this election is three options.
*  Republicans who are the crooks, Democrats who are the cowards, because they don't fight
*  enough for nothing, in the couch.
*  And the couch is voter apathy.
*  And I think that, you know, a lot of people are just discouraged with politics, period.
*  There's all this talk about people being tired of Democrats.
*  No, people are just tired of politics, period.
*  Come November, man, people are just going to be like, eh, because this is probably the
*  most, and what I'm about to say is going to sound so cliche.
*  This is probably the most consequential election of my lifetime, 45.
*  I'm not going to say of all time.
*  But it's hard to get people to believe that, because we say that about every presidential
*  election, because every Republican candidate has been demonized in that way.
*  So now that you really do have the woof out there, you look like the party who cried woof
*  because you made, you put everything on the same scale.
*  This Donald Trump guy is different.
*  Like, the things he wants to do is different.
*  You've seen what he's capable of doing and willing to do.
*  Now that he knows the things that he can get away with, and the people around him know
*  the things that they can get away with, you think they're not going to go all the way
*  for it.
*  But it's hard to explain that to people because, you know, people have been hearing that it's
*  an end to democracy every time there's a Republican presidential candidate.
*  So, Charlamagne, I'm hearing you, and the thing that I'm hearing you say is that you
*  believe that Trump is the wolf at the door, that democracy is under threat.
*  And I've also heard you say, I will not endorse President Biden and Kamala Harris.
*  What does that have to do with voting, though?
*  I've never said I'm not voting.
*  If I'm laying it out right there on the table, and I'm telling you that I'm voting to preserve
*  democracy, who do you think out of those two options is willing to preserve democracy?
*  Just because I don't want to jump out there and say, I'm endorsing this person or I'm
*  endorsing that person.
*  I miss the days when nobody talked about, you know, who they were voting for.
*  I don't know when we had to start laying all that on the table.
*  I'm not endorsing, because I just feel like I've been burned with that before, you know,
*  because you put your name on the line, you endorse somebody, you tell your audience,
*  this is who you should go out there and vote for, and your audience goes and does it.
*  And then when they don't see these things that they thought were going to get pushed
*  They don't understand civics.
*  They're not thinking about that.
*  They're like, all they know is Charlemagne told me to vote for this person because this
*  was going to happen and this didn't happen.
*  One of the things you have been talking about is how they haven't been able to make the
*  things that they've done real to people.
*  Messaging sucks.
*  It's terrible.
*  I say it all the time.
*  The language of politics is dead.
*  If you've ever had a conversation with 90% of these elected officials, man, I love to
*  use 90%.
*  I don't know why.
*  But if you talk to like, and I'll use examples.
*  If you talk to Vice President Kamala Harris behind the scenes, you're like, where is this
*  person?
*  If America saw this person, if this person, and you saw glimpses of it, and you know,
*  when she used to be like holding it to those people in those Senate hearings, right, holding
*  it to those other officials.
*  But if you saw this person and this person decided to say, you know what, I'm not going
*  to let Fox News manipulate my narratives anymore.
*  I'm going to go on Fox News and have these conversations with this audience.
*  You'll be surprised how many people that's probably watching Fox News, you know, those
*  hypothetical swing voters they love so much.
*  They'd be like, I like her.
*  It's the craziest psychological mind fuck when you talk to these people.
*  And then you see them in front of the camera.
*  Who is this person?
*  And I'm not just putting it on the vice president, because I think that there's a whole democratic
*  party of surrogates that President Biden should be using.
*  I think he should be using Governor Shapiro.
*  I think he should be using Governor Newsom, because I think Governor Newsom did a great
*  job of elevating himself in the conversation by going on Fox News, by going on Sean Hannity
*  Show, by debating, you know, Ron DeSantis.
*  I think he should be using Governor Westmore of Maryland.
*  I think he should be using those individuals to really tell the story of what's going on.
*  But you know, I do put a lot on the vice president, because I think she's so talented.
*  You just mentioned a whole bunch of surrogates that the Biden administration should deploy.
*  You didn't mention former President Obama.
*  And I'm just curious why not, and if you think he is a good surrogate for Biden.
*  I don't know.
*  That's a great question.
*  It don't feel like he's on the front lines.
*  It don't feel like he's in active duty.
*  Like all of those other people, their gun is warm right now.
*  I feel like his gun is on safety, locked up in a boat somewhere.
*  You know, not saying that he can't come out and get it cracking, but I just don't, I don't know.
*  He just don't, he don't.
*  He doesn't what, feel relevant?
*  I guess I can't say relevant, right?
*  He's President Barack Obama.
*  That's what I was about to say.
*  He can't say relevant.
*  He just don't, he don't feel like he's of this moment.
*  And maybe that's his own doing.
*  I don't know what he could say that's going to really move people in 2024.
*  I mean, don't get me wrong, he's one of the best speakers of all time.
*  But I just don't know what he could say in this moment that's going to move people.
*  Because a lot of people, I remember when he came out and he put out a tweet about Roe v.
*  Wade after Roe v. Wade was overturned.
*  And a lot of people got on him and they was like, yo, this is your fault.
*  You had an opportunity to codify Roe v. Wade when you were in the White House.
*  So don't come out shaking your finger at us now.
*  You know, like I saw the backlash to that.
*  And by the way, he could do whatever he wanted.
*  He's the former President of Barack Obama.
*  Instead of talking to the American people, I think that what he's doing, from what I've
*  heard behind the scenes, pushing the Biden administration, lighting the fire up under
*  their ass, telling them they need to have a sense of urgency.
*  Hey, y'all may lose this election in 2024 if y'all don't pivot here and pivot there.
*  I think that's where he's probably most suited.
*  This is my last question for now.
*  Are you optimistic about where this country's going?
*  Depends, right?
*  Because when you say country, there's a lot of different parts to that.
*  I'm optimistic because I have to be.
*  Because I grew up poor and disenfranchised on a dirt road in Moncks Corner, South Carolina.
*  I grew up in a single wide trailer.
*  So it's like, I have no choice but to be optimistic as a black man in America because
*  I've seen the worst of the worst.
*  I wouldn't be sitting here with you, having a conversation with you, if I didn't have
*  a case for optimism.
*  But man, what scares me the most is that you have all of the so-called smart people being
*  dumb.
*  And I really think it's because of social media.
*  I think social media is ruining us.
*  And I think that it's only going to get worse because people don't know what's real and
*  they don't know what's not real now.
*  I feel like that's what they do with me.
*  They can literally take a clip of something I said and say, look, he's supporting Donald
*  Trump.
*  But they can take this clip and say, look, he's supporting Biden.
*  It's like, no, I'm just having objective, nuanced conversation.
*  And what scares me is that somebody's going to watch this whole New York, listen to this
*  whole New York Times interview and people are going to take what they want from it to
*  push their narrative.
*  How does that help people?
*  It makes us not even want to try to see things from a different way because we don't want
*  the words that are coming out of our mouth to be misconstrued.
*  So when you ask me, am I optimistic?
*  I have no choice but to be because I believe in a high power.
*  I believe in God.
*  But man, the way things are going right now, I think that we're doing a great job of
*  letting a would be dictator back into the White House.
*  Charlemagne, we're going to talk later this week and I'm really looking forward to it.
*  Absolutely. Thank you for having me.
*  After the break, I follow up with Charlemagne about how he feels let down by the Democrats
*  and why those polls about black voters really drive him crazy.
*  They're not going to blame this on black men.
*  I see where this narrative is going and I don't like it.
*  Charlemagne.
*  It is. It's Lulu.
*  What's up, Lulu?
*  Charlemagne, I've been thinking about something you said earlier.
*  You know, we talked a lot about Democrats bad messaging, but not a lot about the substance
*  of the Biden administration's policies.
*  What was it that you didn't get from them that you wanted to get?
*  Oh, man, personally, just for me, I just think there's a lot of things that they could have
*  been way stronger on because they told us vote for President Biden, get him in the White
*  House. Then they said, you know, they pushed in Georgia to get these Senate seats, you
*  know, because they can get the number of seats they need and they can really make things
*  happen. And Vice President Kamala Harris will have the tiebreaker.
*  But man, it's like they volunteer those lies, right, because they know the politics of
*  their senators like Joe Manchin and Kristen Sinema.
*  They know the politics of them better than we the people do.
*  So they knew that there was a lot of these things that they wouldn't be able to make
*  happen, like the George Floyd Policing Act, like like the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.
*  Like they knew these things weren't going to happen.
*  Like we can keep saying things like, well, it's it's Congress's fault.
*  Yes, it is.
*  You're right. But guess who's the president of the United States of America?
*  That person gets the credit.
*  What you saw recently, you know, with this so-called uptick that's supposed to happen
*  with black votes in Trump.
*  Like I said, I think that's overstated.
*  But I do think there are three tangible things people point to in regard to the president,
*  Trump. And one is those stimulus checks.
*  Another is those PPP loans.
*  And another is the First Step Act.
*  And the reason those three things resonate with people is because folks actually got
*  money in their pocket, but they're not looking as to why.
*  It's sadly because we had to go through something like COVID.
*  So you don't want millions of people to have to die for you to get a stimulus check or
*  for you to get a PPP loan.
*  And then the First Step Act, there's people who actually saw family members and, you
*  know, people they love actually get out of prison.
*  And he takes the credit for it.
*  But isn't there something bigger going on?
*  Because I recently heard you interview Ray J.
*  And he said, in his world, at least, you can't get canceled for supporting Trump
*  anymore. I'm going to quote it.
*  He said, I guarantee you this.
*  You can't get canceled if you say you're going to vote Donald Trump like you used to.
*  If you say that you are risking something.
*  Now it's like I'm voting for him, too.
*  I mean, we'll see.
*  I can't say just because Ray J.
*  wants to vote for Trump.
*  That is a shit.
*  And all black men.
*  Maybe I'm deluded by the fact that I'm not voting for him.
*  And I just don't think that any no one celebrity or any influencer or YouTuber
*  has that kind of power.
*  Maybe maybe it's me.
*  Maybe I'm bugging.
*  Maybe I need to take a step back and really look at all of this power and influence
*  that you all say these individuals have.
*  I don't see Ray J.
*  saying that making me believe that 30 percent of all black men are going to come out
*  and vote for Donald Trump.
*  Do I think it's going to be an uptick?
*  Yes, I just don't think the numbers will be like that.
*  And I know to be clear, Ray J.
*  didn't say he was going to vote for Donald Trump.
*  Let's also be clear.
*  That's not what he said.
*  Yeah, he just said that, you know, it's cool not to say it for Trump.
*  But I don't want this.
*  The other thing I don't want to.
*  They're not going to blame this on black men.
*  It like they're not going to do that.
*  Like, I already see where this is going.
*  Like, I hate it.
*  I hate it.
*  In 2016, when Hillary Clinton ran for president, black women showed up like they
*  always do or second highest base with us black men.
*  When it comes to Donald Trump, those white suburban women elected him in 2016.
*  And 2020, a lot of them were were right there, too.
*  They're not about to blame this on black men.
*  No, I see where this narrative is going and I don't like it.
*  I mean, I guess people find the shift, if shifted, is surprising because
*  I guess they're wondering why isn't the racism a deal breaker?
*  Or is that an unfair assumption to make about black voters?
*  Well, I can't speak for all black voters, but I will say they said
*  Lyndon B. Johnson was a racist.
*  But I mean, look at the things that Martin Luther King Jr.
*  and the civil the different civil rights movements at that time were able to push
*  Lyndon B. Johnson to do.
*  I mean, you know, when you bring up President Biden, you cannot bring up
*  President Biden without talking about the 80s mandatory minimum
*  citizen, 88 crack laws and the 94 crime bill.
*  And I remember if people go back and watch my conversation with Joe Biden
*  on Breakfast Club, I said to him, you know, the 94 crime bill
*  led to mass incarceration.
*  He goes, no, it was mandatory minimum citizen.
*  And I go, yeah. And you were behind that one, too.
*  So it's like so it's like we know all of these things, but we still, you know,
*  vote because we have to vote for our best interests.
*  Like, you know, we have to vote for the people that we feel like we can move.
*  Charlamagne, I want to bring it back to you.
*  Because, you know, you have found yourself in this position
*  where you have a lot of influence, I would say a lot of power.
*  And I'm wondering how you feel about that.
*  How far does it reach? Where do you want it to go?
*  I can promise you I am not sitting around thinking about how much bylaw I got.
*  I know I know that, but you know what I mean?
*  But I just wonder like that kind of it kind of makes my skin crawl a little bit.
*  Like, I'm not I'm not even thinking about that.
*  I say it all the time. I'm just a person on who has a ticket to a show
*  who gets to go talk to the artist after the show.
*  So I'm watching the same thing that everybody else is watching.
*  I'm in tune with the same thing that everybody else is in tune with.
*  I didn't get to sit down and have a conversation with these people
*  when the show is over.
*  And that's that's literally how I always approach it.
*  I just always approach it from a place of curiosity.
*  That's it. Nothing more, nothing less.
*  I just want people to get information
*  and you do whatever it is you choose to do with that information.
*  I don't have any other.
*  I don't have any other aspirations other than that.
*  That's Charlemagne, the God.
*  His new book is Get Honest or Die Lying.
*  Why Small Talk Sucks.
