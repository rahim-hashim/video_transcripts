*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Barrow. This is The Daily.
*  Today, the story behind the bombshell court rolling issued last night that could knock
*  Donald Trump off the ballot for president in Colorado and open the floodgates for efforts
*  to disqualify him across the country. I spoke with my colleague, Supreme Court reporter,
*  Adam Lipdack. It's Wednesday, December 20th.
*  So, Adam, thank you for jumping on with us so last minute and so late at night. It is
*  10 p.m. on the nose. And we're talking to you at this ungodly hour because we've all
*  just been jolted by a very big ruling from the Colorado Supreme Court. Can you briefly
*  just describe that ruling?
*  The Colorado Supreme Court by a 4-3 vote said that Donald Trump is not eligible to be on
*  the ballot for the Republican primary election there, saying that a provision of the 14th
*  amendment adopted after the Civil War bars people who have engaged in insurrection
*  from holding federal office. The Donald Trump did engage in an insurrection in his efforts
*  to overturn the 2020 election and that this clause, although fashion for the aftermath
*  of the Civil War continues to have force and requires the court to bar him from being
*  on the ballot.
*  So just in summary, the court has found that Trump's overall conduct around what we have
*  come to call January 6th, his role in a pretty elaborate effort to overturn the 2020 election
*  despite losing it means that he should not be allowed to stand for re-election in
*  Colorado, which would seem to have very big implications for the 2024 election because
*  it's an election that's about to start in just a few weeks, primaries will be underway
*  by mid-January.
*  Yes, so it's enormously consequential in Colorado. There are similar lawsuits filed in other
*  states, notably Michigan. This decision will almost certainly result in even more of them.
*  And this really needs to be an issue that is resolved on a nationwide basis, meaning
*  it has to go to the Supreme Court and it would be shocking if the Supreme Court would not
*  wait in, take this case or a similar one, and issue a ruling on this question that, you
*  know, a decade ago, did it impossible to imagine that the Civil War, your constitutional
*  provision could at least in legal theory knock the leading candidate of one of the two major
*  political parties off the ballot.
*  Right. I mean, what you're describing is a Supreme Court case with monumental
*  stakes because the court will be asked to shape the contours of the next presidential race.
*  Right. And, you know, the Supreme Court knows that it can't let chaos reign. It has to issue
*  a definitive ruling. So it's kind of impossible to imagine that one court having gone this far
*  in the Supreme Court of a major state that the US Supreme Court would stay out of it. It will
*  feel obligated to give us a definitive answer. Okay. So, and given how big the stakes of this
*  already are and how big they are going to be when the Supreme Court takes it up, give us the
*  story behind this pretty extraordinary case and how it is that it ever reaches this point.
*  So it didn't take long after January 6th for liberal legal activists and others to note that
*  just as the Constitution says you can't be president if you're not 35 years old,
*  you also can't be president if you're an insurrectionist. And the theory being that section 3
*  of the 14th Amendment bars people who have taken an oath to support the Constitution of the United
*  States from holding office if they then, quote, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against
*  the same or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. So they say that fits Donald Trump pretty
*  well. And this theory gets a lot of applause and support from precisely the people you might imagine
*  from liberals. But as time goes on, legal scholars and others start to say, wait a second, this actually
*  makes sense. Scholars like who? Well, the issue really gets turbocharged in August.
*  When two prominent conservative law professors, members of the Federalist Society,
*  William Boad of the University of Chicago and Michael Stokes-Polson of the University of
*  St. Thomas, published an early draft of a long article that's going to be in the University
*  of Pennsylvania Law Review. And they are originalists, meaning that they try to unearth the original
*  meaning of the constitutional provision. And the more they looked at it, the more they thought it
*  was indisputable that Donald Trump had committed to kinds of acts that the provision gets triggered by.
*  And otherwise qualifies as someone who should be excluded from the ballot because of the things
*  he did. So these conservative-minded legal theorists who you might think on paper would be inclined
*  to identify with Trump agree that Trump does qualify as an insurrectionist under the 14th Amendment.
*  And as a result, should be ineligible from being on the ballot for the presidency.
*  Yeah, they looked at the historical record and they found that there was as they put it a
*  bond in dividends that Trump engaged in an insurrection, including by setting out to overturn
*  the results of the election, trying to alter vote counts by fraud and intimidation,
*  pressuring the vice president to violate the Constitution, calling for the march on the Capitol.
*  I mean, they say that every official in the land, that election officials themselves,
*  the state secretaries of state and charge of state election law, has an obligation to keep Trump
*  off the ballot. Wow. The Constitution simply says they say that if you've done these things,
*  you cannot be president. And so how does this turbocharged conversation lead to a case in Colorado?
*  A group of Colorado voters file a lawsuit saying Donald Trump should not be allowed to be on the
*  primary ballot and the lawsuit proceeds and it goes to a state trial judge and she does something
*  interesting. She says, first of all, that Donald Trump did engage in insurrection, but she says
*  section three nonetheless doesn't apply to him. Huh. For two reasons. She says that the only oath he
*  took as president to support the Constitution was not the kind of oath that triggers section three.
*  And she says the office that he seeks, the presidency, is not one of the offices from which section
*  three disqualifies people. So for both of those reasons, she says section three doesn't apply to
*  Donald Trump, even though he engaged in insurrection. So what happens after that? Well, there's an appeal
*  on a very quick schedule to the Colorado Supreme Court. Both sides are unhappy with some parts of
*  the decision. Donald Trump is not happy to be called an insurrectionist. The voters are not happy
*  that they lose on what they see as a kind of weird technicality. And the state Supreme Court
*  for the first time in the history of the Republic is faced with the question of whether it's going to
*  disqualify a candidate for president from one of the major political parties.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Adam, once the Colorado Supreme Court and its judges take up this case on appeal, what happens to
*  it? So the court has a long involved oral argument. The justices are quite engaged. They're all
*  them appointed by Democrats, but they come at the case from many different angles. There are lots of
*  legal issues in it. And Trump's lawyers dispute the insurrectionist point to some extent. They
*  minimize Donald Trump's involvement. They say maybe it was more riot than an insurrection,
*  but they really press hardest on the point that the provision we've been talking about, section three
*  of the 14th Amendment, doesn't apply to their client and doesn't apply to the office of the
*  presidency. So they seize on this lower court judges decision. Right. And they get a kind of
*  skeptical response from at least some of the justices on the Colorado Supreme Court. One of them
*  saying, how is that not absurd? I mean, in what world would the framers of the 14th Amendment
*  want to disqualify everybody from every federal office who has engaged an insurrection except for
*  a former president and except for the office of the presidency? The court looked at lots of other
*  issues too. Most of them, you know, too technical to spend a lot of time on, but there are questions
*  like, does the court have jurisdiction? Is this a political question that should not be resolved
*  by judges? Does Congress have to act to implement the 14th Amendment? It's a ticket of complicated
*  legal issues. But the two key points are the factual one, did he engage in insurrection?
*  And the legal one does section three apply to him at all. And when the court rules, four to three,
*  they say that the voters challenging Trump's candidacy have run the table on all of these issues,
*  have established that he is an insurrectionist and have established also that the provision section
*  three applies to Donald Trump. And in issuing this decision, the four justices and the majority
*  seem to recognize the gravity of what they were doing. They wrote, we do not reach these conclusions
*  lightly. We are mindful of the magnitude and weight of the questions now before us.
*  We are likewise mindful of our solemn duty to apply the law without fear or favor.
*  And without being swayed by public reaction to the decisions that the law mandates we reach.
*  Okay, so let's now turn Adam to the question of how quickly this case is likely to get to the US
*  Supreme Court now on appeal and how we think this Supreme Court is likely to receive it and think
*  about it. There's every reason to think Donald Trump will go to the Supreme Court in very short
*  order. And there's every reason to think the court will take the case and in due course, but
*  probably not for a month or two issue a definitive ruling. What will that ruling be? Well, I think
*  that we should first of all reject the idea that it's a predictable six three ruling in favor of Donald
*  Trump. Because the courts, because our majority is six to three liberals. That's right. Six
*  Republican appointees, three Democratic appointees, and on a kind of knucklehead level, you might think,
*  well, that'll tell us what's going on. Right. But I think what will weigh on the justice's more
*  and on both sides of the ideological aisle is who should decide this question?
*  Should the voters take account of Donald Trump's conduct in the aftermath of the 2020 election and
*  make judgments for themselves about whether he's fit to be president again? Or should courts
*  relying on a provision of the Constitution of the United States that seems to speak to this issue
*  take that question out of the voters hands? Interesting. Many of the justices you're saying,
*  perhaps all the justices, even the liberal justices, maybe reluctant to issue the kind of ruling
*  against Trump, in this case, that would effectively take electoral choices away from voters.
*  Yes, that's right. And I think that works on two levels. The justices, of course, will understand
*  themselves to be making a purely legal judgment based on text, history, structure of the Constitution,
*  the facts, and so on. But even some of the doctrines that they're looking at, like the so-called
*  political question doctrine, which urges courts to stay out of some kinds of disputes, are broadly
*  similar to an impulse that many people might have in a non-legal sense, that these are serious
*  matters. Donald Trump is accused of doing grave wrongs in trying to overturn the election.
*  But who should decide the consequences of that? Should it be nine people in Washington?
*  Or should it be the electorate of the United States, which can, you know, for itself, assess
*  whether Trump's conduct is so blameworthy that he should not have the opportunity to serve
*  another term? Another way to think about this is that you're suggesting that judicial restraint
*  in matters of an election might override the justices' impulse to carefully read the 14th
*  amendment and the facts of this case and find that Trump is an insurrectionist and that the courts
*  have the power to take him off the ballot. The prospect of what would be a profoundly anti-democratic
*  ruling saying that people who want to vote for Donald Trump may not vote for him is going
*  away on the justices. It will be part of the rich stew of calculations that go into their decision
*  in this case. Got it. And if I'm reading much of my lines here, what you're really saying is
*  it's going to be unlikely that the Supreme Court rules that Trump should be taken off the ballot
*  in Colorado or any other state where voters are filing similar lawsuits.
*  It's early days. We've just had the first major decision. There's going to be a lot of briefs,
*  a lot of arguments and we'll learn a lot more. But if you ask me today what the likely outcome is
*  the Supreme Court, it is not that they're going to tell the American public that one of the two
*  leading candidates for presidents can't be on the ballot.
*  Well, let's play with that for just a moment. Let's say the Supreme Court surprises us, surprises
*  you and decides to let this ruling from Colorado Supreme Court stand. Just on a legal basis,
*  what would be the consequences of that given, as you have said, that people are trying to
*  file similar lawsuits across the country? You would expect lawsuits in just about every state.
*  And you would expect some state election officials, some state secretaries of state
*  to themselves take action to take Trump off the ballot. If the Supreme Court were to greenlight the
*  idea that Trump's participation in the aftermath of the 2020 election disqualifies him,
*  it would give rise to all kinds of actions in all kinds of states.
*  It seems hard to overstate Adam just how delicate this moment seems to be. We have a deeply polarized
*  electorate, an election that is shaping up to be excruciatingly close according to many polls.
*  And the knowledge that the last election featuring the same two candidates we think might end up
*  being the nominees again, ended with a violent insurrection at the Capitol. We've been talking about
*  it over doubts about the legitimacy of that election. And now this election is already in court long
*  before any votes have been cast. And the courts are being asked whether one of these two candidates
*  should even be allowed on the ballot. And so depending on the ruling, those really do look like
*  the ingredients for a potential powder keg for something that could be very scary.
*  Yeah, Michael, it's a dangerous moment. I got an email tonight from Rick Hass in a prominent
*  election law specialist at UCLA who said the stakes remind him of Bush v. Gore, the 2000 decision
*  that handed the presidency to George W. Bush. He said once again, the Supreme Court is being thrust
*  into the center of a US presidential election. But unlike in 2000, the general political instability
*  in the United States makes the situation now much more precarious.
*  Well, Adam, thank you very much. We really appreciate it. Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. On Tuesday, the US military laid out a plan to create
*  a naval coalition to confront militants in Yemen who have been using drones and rockets to attack
*  commercial ships in the Red Sea. The militants, members of the Houthi militia, began firing on the
*  ships as a protest of Israel's war on Hamas, an ally of the Houthis. As a result, some of the world's
*  biggest companies have stopped sending their tankers through the Red Sea. The new naval coalition
*  will include contributions from among others, Britain, Bahrain, Canada, France, and Italy.
*  And a new analysis shows that 2023 was a uniquely unproductive year for the House of Representatives.
*  The Republican leg chamber passed just 27 bills that became law, despite holding 724 votes.
*  According to the bipartisan policy center, that is more voting and less law-making than at any other
*  point in the past decade. Today's episode was produced by Rob Zipco and Carlos Prieto.
*  It was edited by Lisa Chao and Rachel Cuesta, contains original music from Mary and LaZana and Dan
*  Powell, and was engineered by Chris Wood. Our theme music is by Jim Grundberg and Ben Lantzfer,

*  That's it for the Daily. I'm Michael Bobaro. See you tomorrow.
