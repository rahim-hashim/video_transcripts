# Why a Colorado Court Just Knocked Trump Off the Ballot
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AaJ-W4xhjQ)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro. This is The Daily.
*  Today, the story behind the bombshell court ruling issued last night that could knock
*  Donald Trump off the ballot for president in Colorado and open the floodgates for efforts
*  to disqualify him across the country.
*  I spoke with my colleague, Supreme Court reporter Adam Liptak.
*  It's Wednesday, December 20th.
*  So Adam, thank you for jumping on with us so last minute and so late at night. It is
*  10 p.m. on the nose. And we're talking to you at this ungodly hour because we've all
*  just been jolted by a very big ruling from the Colorado Supreme Court. Can you briefly
*  just describe that ruling?
*  The Colorado Supreme Court, by a four to three vote, said that Donald Trump is not eligible
*  to be on the ballot for the Republican primary election there, saying that a provision of
*  the 14th Amendment adopted after the Civil War bars people who have engaged in insurrection
*  from holding federal office, that Donald Trump did engage in an insurrection in his efforts
*  to overturn the 2020 election, and that this clause, although fashioned for the aftermath
*  of the Civil War, continues to have force and requires the court to bar him from being
*  on the ballot.
*  So just in summary, the court has found that Trump's overall conduct around what we have
*  come to call January 6th, his role in a pretty elaborate effort to overturn the 2020 election
*  despite losing it, means that he should not be allowed to stand for reelection in Colorado,
*  which would seem to have very big implications for the 2024 election because it's an election
*  that's about to start in just a few weeks. Primaries will be underway by mid-January.
*  Yeah, so it's enormously consequential in Colorado. There are similar lawsuits filed
*  in other states, notably Michigan. This decision will almost certainly result in even more
*  of them. And this really needs to be an issue that is resolved on a nationwide basis, meaning
*  it has to go to the Supreme Court. And it would be shocking if the Supreme Court would
*  not wait in, take this case or a similar one, and issue a ruling on this question that,
*  you know, a decade ago, it would have been impossible to imagine that this Civil War
*  era constitutional provision could, at least in legal theory, knock the leading candidate
*  of one of the two major political parties off the ballot.
*  Right. I mean, what you're describing is a Supreme Court case with monumental stakes
*  because the court will be asked to shape the contours of the next presidential race.
*  Right. And, you know, the Supreme Court knows that it can't let chaos reign. It has to issue
*  a definitive ruling. So it's kind of impossible to imagine that one court having gone this
*  far in the Supreme Court of a major state, that the U.S. Supreme Court would stay out
*  of it, it will feel obligated to give us a definitive answer.
*  Okay. So, and given how big the stakes of this already are and how big they are going
*  to be when the Supreme Court takes it up, give us the story behind this pretty extraordinary
*  case and how it is that it ever reaches this point.
*  So it didn't take long after January 6th for liberal legal activists and others to note
*  that just as the Constitution says you can't be president if you're not 35 years old, you
*  also can't be president if you're an insurrectionist. And the theory being that Section 3 of the
*  14th Amendment bars people who have taken an oath to support the Constitution of the
*  United States from holding office if they then, quote, shall have engaged in insurrection
*  or rebellion against the same or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. So they
*  say that fits Donald Trump pretty well. And this theory gets a lot of applause and support
*  from precisely the people you might imagine from liberals. But as time goes on, legal
*  scholars and others start to say, wait a second, this actually makes sense.
*  Scholars like who?
*  Well, the issue really gets turbocharged in August when two prominent conservative law
*  professors, members of the Federalist Society, William Bode of the University of Chicago
*  and Michael Stokes Paulson of the University of St. Thomas, publish an early draft of a
*  long article that's going to be in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review. And they are
*  originalists, meaning that they try to unearth the original meaning of the constitutional
*  provision. And the more they looked at it, the more they thought it was indisputable
*  that Donald Trump had committed the kinds of acts that the provision gets triggered
*  by and otherwise qualifies as someone who should be excluded from the ballot because
*  of the things he did.
*  So these conservative minded legal theorists, who you might think on paper would be inclined
*  to identify with Trump, agree that Trump does qualify as an insurrectionist under the 14th
*  Amendment and as a result should be ineligible from being on the ballot for the presidency.
*  Yeah, they looked at the historical record and they found that there was, as they put
*  it, abundant evidence that Trump engaged in an insurrection, including by setting out
*  to overturn the results of the election, trying to alter vote counts by fraud and intimidation,
*  pressuring the vice president to violate the Constitution, calling for the march on the
*  Capitol. I mean, they say that every official in the land, that election officials themselves,
*  the state secretaries of state in charge of state election law, has an obligation to
*  keep Trump off the ballot.
*  The Constitution simply says, they say, that if you've done these things, you cannot be
*  president.
*  And so how does this turbocharged conversation lead to a case in Colorado?
*  A group of Colorado voters filed a lawsuit saying Donald Trump should not be allowed
*  to be on the primary ballot and the lawsuit proceeds and it goes to a state trial judge
*  and she does something interesting.
*  She says, first of all, that Donald Trump did engage in insurrection, but she says Section
*  Three nonetheless doesn't apply to him for two reasons.
*  She says that the only oath he took as president to support the Constitution was not the kind
*  of oath that triggers Section Three.
*  And she says the office that he seeks, the presidency, is not one of the offices from
*  which Section Three disqualifies people.
*  So for both of those reasons, she says Section Three doesn't apply to Donald Trump, even
*  though he engaged in insurrection.
*  So what happens after that?
*  Well there's an appeal on a very quick schedule to the Colorado Supreme Court.
*  Both sides are unhappy with some parts of the decision.
*  Donald Trump is not happy to be called an insurrectionist.
*  The voters are not happy that they lose on what they see as a kind of weird technicality.
*  And the state Supreme Court, for the first time in the history of the republic, is faced
*  with the question of whether it's going to disqualify a candidate for president from
*  one of the major political parties.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Adam, once the Colorado Supreme Court and its judges take up this case on appeal, what
*  happens to it?
*  So the court has a long involved oral argument.
*  The justices are quite engaged.
*  They're all of them appointed by Democrats, but they come at the case from many different
*  angles.
*  There are lots of legal issues in it.
*  And Trump's lawyers dispute the insurrectionist point to some extent.
*  They minimize Donald Trump's involvement.
*  They say maybe it was more a riot than an insurrection.
*  But they really press hardest on the point that the provision we've been talking about,
*  section three of the 14th Amendment, doesn't apply to their client and doesn't apply to
*  the office of the presidency.
*  So they seize on this lower court judge's decision.
*  Right.
*  And they get a kind of skeptical response from at least some of the justices on the
*  Colorado Supreme Court, one of them saying, how is that not absurd?
*  I mean, in what world would the framers of the 14th Amendment want to disqualify everybody
*  from every federal office who is engaged in insurrection, except for a former president
*  and except for the office of the presidency?
*  The court looked at lots of other issues, too, most of them too technical to spend a
*  lot of time on.
*  But there are questions like, does the court have jurisdiction?
*  Is this a political question that should not be resolved by judges?
*  Does Congress have to act to implement the 14th Amendment?
*  It's a ticket of complicated legal issues.
*  The two key points are the factual one.
*  Did he engage in insurrection and the legal one?
*  Does section three apply to him at all?
*  And when the court rules four to three, they say that the voters challenging Trump's candidacy
*  have run the table on all of these issues, have established that he is an insurrectionist
*  and have established also that the provision, section three, applies to Donald Trump.
*  And in issuing this decision, the four justices and the majority seemed to recognize the gravity
*  of what they were doing.
*  They wrote, we do not reach these conclusions lightly.
*  We are mindful of the magnitude and weight of the questions now before us.
*  We are likewise mindful of our solemn duty to apply the law without fear or favor and
*  without being swayed by public reaction to the decisions that the law mandates we reach.
*  Okay.
*  So let's now turn Adam to the question of how quickly this case is likely to get to
*  the US Supreme Court now on appeal and how we think this Supreme Court is likely to receive
*  it and think about it.
*  There's every reason to think Donald Trump will go to the Supreme Court in very short
*  order and there's every reason to think the court will take the case and in due course,
*  but probably not for a month or two, issue a definitive ruling.
*  What will that ruling be?
*  Well, I think that we should first of all reject the idea that it's a predictable six-three
*  ruling in favor of Donald Trump.
*  Because the court's conservative majority is six to three liberals.
*  That's right.
*  Three Republican appointees, three Democratic appointees, and on a kind of knucklehead level
*  you might think, well, that'll tell us what's going on.
*  But I think what will weigh on the justices more and on both sides of the ideological
*  aisle is who should decide this question.
*  Should the voters take account of Donald Trump's conduct in the aftermath of the 2020 election
*  and make judgments for themselves about whether he's fit to be president again?
*  Or should courts relying on a provision of the Constitution of the United States that
*  seems to speak to this issue, take that question out of the voters' hands?
*  Interesting.
*  Many of the justices, you're saying perhaps all the justices, even the liberal justices,
*  may be reluctant to issue the kind of ruling against Trump in this case that would effectively
*  take electoral choices away from voters.
*  Yes, that's right.
*  And I think that works on two levels.
*  The justices, of course, will understand themselves to be making a purely legal judgment based
*  on text, history, structure of the Constitution, the facts and so on.
*  But even some of the doctrines that they're looking at, like the so-called political question
*  which urges courts to stay out of some kinds of disputes, are broadly similar to an impulse
*  that many people might have in a non-legal sense that these are serious matters.
*  Donald Trump is accused of doing grave wrongs in trying to overturn the election.
*  But who should decide the consequences of that?
*  Should it be nine people in Washington?
*  Or should it be the electorate of the United States, which can for itself assess whether
*  Trump's conduct is so blameworthy that he should not have the opportunity to serve another
*  term?
*  Another way to think about this is that you're suggesting that judicial restraint in matters
*  of an election might override the justices impulse to carefully read the 14th Amendment
*  and the facts of this case and find that Trump is an insurrectionist and that the courts
*  have the power to take him off the ballot.
*  The prospect of what would be a profoundly anti-democratic ruling saying that people
*  want to vote for Donald Trump may not vote for him is going to weigh on the justices.
*  It will be part of the rich stew of calculations that go into their decision in this case.
*  Got it.
*  And if I'm reading what you're saying, what you're really saying is it's going to be unlikely
*  that the Supreme Court rules that Trump should be taken off the ballot in Colorado or any
*  other state where voters are filing similar lawsuits.
*  It's early days.
*  We've just had the first major decision.
*  There's going to be a lot of briefs, a lot of arguments, and we'll learn a lot more.
*  But if you ask me today what the likely outcome is at the Supreme Court, it is not that they're
*  going to tell the American public that one of the two leading candidates for president
*  can't be on the ballot.
*  Well, let's play with that for just a moment.
*  Let's say the Supreme Court surprises us, surprises you, and decides to let this ruling
*  from Colorado Supreme Court stand just on a legal basis.
*  What would be the consequences of that given, as you have said, that people are trying to
*  file similar lawsuits across the country?
*  You would expect lawsuits in just about every state, and you would expect some state election
*  officials, some state secretaries of state to themselves take action to take Trump off
*  the ballot.
*  If the Supreme Court were to green light the idea that Trump's participation in the aftermath
*  of the 2020 election disqualifies him, it would give rise to all kinds of actions in
*  all kinds of states.
*  It seems hard to overstate, Adam, just how delicate this moment seems to be.
*  We have a deeply polarized electorate, an election that is shaping up to be excruciatingly
*  close according to many polls, and the knowledge that the last election, featuring the same
*  two candidates we think might end up being the nominees again, ended with a violent insurrection
*  at the Capitol, we've been talking about it, over doubts about the legitimacy of that
*  election.
*  Now, this election is already in court long before any votes have been cast, and the courts
*  are being asked whether one of these two candidates should even be allowed on the ballot.
*  And so depending on the ruling, those really do look like the ingredients for a potential
*  powder keg, for something that could be very scary.
*  Yeah, Michael, it's a dangerous moment.
*  I got an email tonight from Rick Hassan, a prominent election law specialist at UCLA,
*  who said the stakes remind him of Bush v. Gore, the 2000 decision that handed the presidency
*  to George W. Bush.
*  He said, once again, the Supreme Court is being thrust into the center of a US presidential
*  But unlike in 2000, the general political instability in the United States makes the
*  situation now much more precarious.
*  Well, Adam, thank you very much.
*  We really appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Tuesday, the US military laid out a plan to create a naval coalition to confront militants
*  in Yemen who have been using drones and rockets to attack commercial ships in the Red Sea.
*  The militants, members of the Houthi militia, began firing on the ships as a protest of
*  Israel's war on Hamas, an ally of the Houthis.
*  As a result, some of the world's biggest companies have stopped sending their tankers
*  through the Red Sea.
*  The new naval coalition will include contributions from, among others,
*  Britain, Bahrain, Canada, France, and Italy.
*  And a new analysis shows that 2023 was a uniquely unproductive year for the House of Representatives.
*  The Republican-led chamber passed just 27 bills that became law, despite holding 724 votes.
*  According to the Bipartisan Policy Center, that is more voting and less
*  lawmaking than at any other point in the past decade.
