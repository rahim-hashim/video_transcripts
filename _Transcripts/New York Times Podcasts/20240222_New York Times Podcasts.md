*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavranici, and this is the Daily.
*  Last week, the Russian authorities announced that Alexei Navalny, the leader of Russia's
*  opposition movement, had died in prison at the age of 47.
*  Navalny was Vladimir Putin's most audacious and relentless critic.
*  His fight against corruption resonated far beyond liberal Moscow, and his central message
*  to Russians.
*  Do not be afraid because our fear is their power.
*  That was how Navalny lived his life, thumbing his nose at Putin's regime in the face of
*  poisoning prison and ultimately death.
*  Today, his friend Yavganya Albutz on how Alexei Navalny became such a singular political
*  force and what it means for his country that he's gone.
*  It's Thursday, February 22nd.
*  Can you hear me?
*  I can, can you hear me?
*  Oh, good.
*  Yes.
*  What's up, you know, ladies, please?
*  I know.
*  I'm okay.
*  I'm okay.
*  How are you doing?
*  I don't know how to answer this question to Beltsoriyov.
*  After the death of Alexei Navalny, I called Yavganya Albutz, who goes by Zhenya.
*  She's a Russian journalist and academic.
*  She studies political science.
*  She knew and worked with Navalny for decades.
*  She now lives in exile in the United States.
*  I'm divided between two languages.
*  I also do think in English and in Russian and I also listen to podcasts and YouTube shows
*  in Russian and in English.
*  And I think I live more inside Russia than I live inside the United States except when
*  you have your primaries and then I mean you have stars in South Carolina and I'm waiting
*  for me super Tuesday.
*  So Zhenya, tell me about the first time you met Alexei Navalny.
*  Remember back for me?
*  Where were you at that moment?
*  I was in Moscow.
*  It was 2004.
*  I started teaching at university as a professor of political science.
*  I thought that I was done with journalism.
*  So I decided to collect the group of young politicians, democratically, and try to teach
*  them grassroot politics.
*  And so they started coming to my house in Moscow on a nice street, each Tuesday.
*  There were some 20 young people.
*  Okay.
*  I was cooking the Medina, chicken and potatoes.
*  And we were sitting around the table and we were discussing what can we do?
*  The people who showed up to Zhenya's apartment, many of them have since gone into exile,
*  are been jailed in Russia.
*  But back in those days, they all came to talk about politics and figure out how to do grass
*  roots organizing in Russia, a country that had very little experience with that.
*  Well, it started preparing riots, protest riots.
*  And one of the people who walked through her doors for one of those Tuesday get-togethers
*  was Alexey Navalny.
*  And so he came.
*  He was 27 year old.
*  Back then, he was tall, handsome.
*  He was slightly stooped.
*  He had a bad haircut.
*  She had a beer belly.
*  A beer belly.
*  Yes.
*  He and Henry.
*  And Zhenya, what was your first impression of him?
*  What did you think?
*  I mean, remember back for me.
*  Smart, very attentive, very good in fulfilling tasks and getting things done.
*  But, not only was it not exactly a very good speaker.
*  And Zhenya first met Navalny.
*  He was working a desk job for an opposition party.
*  Zhenya said he wasn't very happy and he wanted something more.
*  At the time, he wasn't the polished political leader that we know today.
*  And I was watching him.
*  I was thinking, God, it's so unfair.
*  He's so handsome, so good looking.
*  He's a pure politician with this beautiful, Slavic face.
*  But he's unable to speak.
*  But she quickly realized he had promise.
*  When the two of them went out to Canvas on behalf of a friend from those Tuesday dinners
*  who was running for a local office in Moscow.
*  We came to speak to people in the courtyard and they were babushki.
*  You know?
*  Great, mothers.
*  Great mothers.
*  Exactly.
*  And we were trying to ask them what are their concerns and they were resentful.
*  They didn't want to speak to us.
*  They were like, you know, who are the old people?
*  You know, who are asking them all this kind of ridiculous questions.
*  And then I saw Navalny who came forward and he smiled.
*  And then he said for joke and he helped one grand mother to get to the bench.
*  And he took another grand mother under her arm.
*  And he started talking and all of a sudden it was like a miracle.
*  All of them.
*  They were listening to him.
*  They were looking at him.
*  They were totally in love with him.
*  And that's when, you know, the first time when I thought he's a born politician.
*  That's his talent.
*  His amazing ability to give people on his side, to talk to them.
*  So he had charmed these resentful grandmothers.
*  He don't just charmed.
*  You know, he sort of, he became their son.
*  Really, who was capable to help them, you know?
*  I didn't know why they had a lot of great qualities in them, so.
*  But he was lacking education.
*  And she himself realized that created only in his life.
*  And then what was.
*  Navalny grew up in a military town outside of Moscow.
*  Geniuses that the schools he attended there were pretty bad, with a narrow Soviet curriculum.
*  But Navalny was hungry to learn.
*  If he was going to have a real political future in Russia, he needed to do more than just
*  charmed grandmothers in court yards.
*  And so in 2009, he had an idea.
*  Now I became to my office and he said,
*  Jamie, I want to go to Yale University.
*  I really think I need to spend the year in the good university, take classes.
*  And he got into this world leaders program at Yale University.
*  When the person promies, he started all things related to American party politics.
*  It was very important to understand for him what kind of system check and balances was
*  built in this country.
*  The role of the Supreme Court.
*  But also how do you win elections?
*  That's what he was looking for, first and foremost.
*  So it was important for his political education.
*  Exactly.
*  He was looking and he had to learn how to do it, how to win.
*  Geniuses became a voracious consumer of all things politics.
*  But also, you know, these famous TV series, Why, the Why, even TV shows.
*  Remember season three and four, a lesson can be for the mayor of Baltimore.
*  And he started trying out some of the things he was learning.
*  He told me that he put chairs for the elderly people who came to his rails, precisely so
*  that they could see it comfortably.
*  And he said, you know what, Jamie, I saw it in the House of Cards.
*  I saw it in the House of Cards.
*  And they told, that's a great idea.
*  So he saw in the House of Cards, the television show with Kevin Spacey, he saw that political
*  leaders would put chairs for elderly people because, you know, that was something you were
*  supposed to do as a politician.
*  And of all, he did that.
*  He does.
*  But meanwhile, he wasn't just studying up on American politics.
*  He was also teaching himself how to use YouTube, building a following online.
*  And he was studying public speaking.
*  And he came up on the stage.
*  And that was brilliant speech.
*  And his political activity and his speeches started getting more polished.
*  Who is this last?
*  Who is this last?
*  He's asking this 100,000-strong crowd standing in front of him.
*  Who is a real power in this country?
*  We.
*  Are we going to give our inspiration to take our country back?
*  No.
*  What is the secret?
*  Yes!
*  There was huge energy, which was kind of out of him.
*  He was very sincere and you felt like he was talking directly to you.
*  Okay.
*  So Navalny is getting a political education.
*  He's becoming a more polished speaker.
*  And he starts to run for office.
*  So he runs for mayor of Moscow in 2013.
*  He gets a pretty significant share of the vote by Russian standards, right?
*  27%.
*  27%.
*  Okay.
*  And then in 2018, he makes a big move.
*  He takes on Putin himself.
*  Tell me about that.
*  Navalny decided to run for the presidency.
*  By then, everybody would know Russia already recognized that the only guy who was capable
*  to challenge Putin was Alexey Navalny.
*  And Navalny started traveling around the country.
*  Russia is a huge country.
*  It's the biggest country in the world.
*  11 times on.
*  So he was going from Ural mountains to the Russian Farid, from the Faris to Mangadar, from
*  Mangadar to the whites and so on.
*  And he was running a campaign pretty much the way that campaign is run in the United
*  States.
*  And Navalny spoke for the roof of the garage, from the stairs of different buildings.
*  He spoke from the rooms of their apartment buildings.
*  You know, he would speak from the left.
*  We should, we must live better.
*  But we don't because they've stolen everything from us and they steal from us every day.
*  Critics.
*  He said, let's go to the Kremlin and get our power back.
*  Power should be in our hands, not in the hands of those crooks, of those cheaters, of those
*  people who told the world of the country.
*  He called the people in the Kremlin crooks and cheaters and said they had stolen your money.
*  In fact, Russia's money that they were thieves basically.
*  Exactly.
*  And people were planning by thousand to listen to him.
*  And the friend of my wife told me that she was impressed to see how people who were pretty
*  much resentful about Navalny who considered him to be a populist and was afraid of his
*  populism.
*  At the end of the meeting, they gave him a standing adhesion.
*  They were so impressed.
*  And so it was important to bring politics from us, who down to the provinces, to the regions
*  of the Russian Federation and bring people there to recognize that they need him as a
*  president because he was going to make life of their city, their town, their region better,
*  more democratic, more prosperous.
*  And, Daniel, what were you thinking as you were watching all of this unfold?
*  I mean, he's doing this very unusual thing for Russia, right?
*  This thing that, to an American audience, is just sort of meat and potatoes political
*  campaigning, but in Russia was kind of a revelation.
*  Yes, I was thinking that I was afraid that they were going to kill him.
*  It was already after, but his new song was killed back in 2015.
*  This is another important opposition leader who was killed not far from the Kremlin actually
*  in a political assassination.
*  Yes.
*  Didn't Evonni himself worry about being killed?
*  Did he talk about this with you?
*  No, I wouldn't say that he talked.
*  But you know, whenever I was bringing about a question of his, you know, security, or
*  getting people who would at least protect him, he kept saying that they were impossible.
*  I think, you know, he just didn't allow himself to think about that.
*  Zhenya, did you have any personal conversations with him about why he wanted to run against
*  Putin in the presidential election?
*  Why he wanted to do that?
*  Because we knew that Putin was very dangerous, that it wasn't important to stop him, because
*  already the majority of democratic institutions in the country were subverted.
*  Once it didn't exist, to be sure it didn't exist.
*  Putin's subordinates from the AFRs being all this checkers, they were grabbing people's
*  property, keeping our people, you know, putting them in jail, making them to go in exile.
*  So it's already, and it was clear that Putin was preparing for some awful development,
*  and they had to be stopped.
*  And it was clear that the only one who was capable to stop Putin was, I'd seen a woman,
*  nobody else had walls to do that.
*  As simple as that.
*  It was not that we discussed whether he should or should not, it was clear that he had to.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Election officials in Russia have banned opposition leader Alexei Navalny from running for president.
*  The country's election commission has barred the Kremlin critic from standing in the March vote,
*  citing a controversial and bezel-met conviction, Navalny says was politically motivated.
*  We are the base of the voters.
*  Before they get the election, it already means to vote for the man and the corruption.
*  When the effort to get him on the ballot failed, what was Navalny's reaction?
*  He was extremely upset. He was very, very angry.
*  But he doesn't relent in his political activities, right? He continues to speak out against Putin,
*  and eventually Putin tries to take Navalny out. He poisons him, and Navalny ends up
*  convolishing in Germany where he recovers. This is a very dramatic part of his life.
*  And he makes, at that point, an interesting decision, which is that he's going to leave his family
*  in Germany and return to Russia, where it seemed like he was pretty much certainly going to be
*  arrested and put in prison. And yet he goes back.
*  So why?
*  Why? To be honest with you, I think that he didn't have any other option to return back.
*  You cannot ask people to be brave and to resist and to reject the regime sitting in the luxury
*  of the European capitals. You have to be with your people. And that's exactly what he said.
*  I am Russian politician. So I have to be in Russia if he said.
*  And he had to demonstrate to people that it was possible to overcome any fear.
*  When he was on trial, he had a piece of paper and he wrote on it,
*  I am not afraid. And you shouldn't be afraid as well.
*  When he gave his interview to the director of this movie, the commander in Navalny,
*  and he was asked, what's going to happen? What people should know if he gets killed?
*  And his answer was, if I get killed, my only message to you, and he said,
*  Russian, don't give up. Don't give up. That was his slogan. That was the main principle of his life.
*  Don't give up. Don't be afraid. It's important to understand that Soviet KGB and nowadays Putin's
*  after-svieh, the political police, which are running the country, its power is based on people's fear.
*  They capable to control the country because people are afraid. And so Navalny was trying to send
*  this message. Don't be afraid. We have to fight this people. This is our country. And that's what we
*  have to do. So really more than any other political issue, his fundamental message was,
*  our fear is their power. Don't allow them that. Don't give it to them. That's what he was saying to
*  people. Exactly. And I realized it sounds like, Zhenya, he didn't think he had any other option.
*  You don't think potentially he had any other option. He had to go back because that's who he was.
*  But I wonder if you think now, what's that the right decision to return to Russia?
*  Yes. It was a right decision to return back to Russia. Yes, he gambled. Yes, he thought that Putin,
*  he wouldn't dare to kill him because he was well-to-famous. And he returned back after he exposed
*  Putin's hankment. And he wrote to me in one of his letters, I know that I'm going to sit in jail
*  as long as Putin is alive. He knew that. You know, it's very difficult to get into someone's
*  else's head. But you know, I just think that he felt humiliated to be afraid of Putin
*  or anybody else. He had the sense of mission of he was running a good fight.
*  And he had all the intention to win this fight. And if you think that you're going to get killed,
*  you're going to start to pity yourself. You know, like he wrote to me, stop being upset.
*  Everything is okay. It's just a historical process. Russia is going through this historical
*  process and we are going along with it. Everything is going to be okay. And even if everything is not
*  going to be okay, we can console ourselves. We will get consolation in the fact of having
*  lived on us to life, so being honest people.
*  Genia, it strikes me that Navalny's true superpower was that he was not afraid. He had this
*  kind of incomprehensible lack of fear, this confidence that he could win despite what it
*  looked like from the outside. And that that gave him this ability to kind of thumb his nose at
*  the system, right? To sort of make fun of it and show people that in the end, it's just a bunch of
*  idiots trying and failing to poison his underwear, right? Like the system was nothing but that.
*  It wasn't that scary. But now that he's dead, it's like that magic trick it disappears.
*  And the death itself seems to teach a different lesson that people should be afraid,
*  that the system is that scary. What do you think of that?
*  I'm not afraid. And if you look at those in Russia, thousands and thousands of people come and
*  you know, they mourn and grieve Navalny, almost 400 people were arrested. People were beaten by
*  the police, but people keep calming and calming and calming. And when you look at their faces,
*  you see that these are predominantly young people. He presented the future to them.
*  Are they going to give up on their future? Are they going to go into exile all of them?
*  It's not possible. But they may stay quiet and do nothing, which is what he advised against, right? I
*  mean, you know, you say, Jean, you're not afraid, but you're in the US in exile, right? It's
*  frightening this regime. And it's a natural response to be afraid of it. So I guess I'm just
*  wondering, why is his legacy? Like what's left? You know, he's gone. Is there anything that survives him?
*  I think his legacy is his belief that Russia is more doomed, that Russia will become a normal,
*  centralized, democratic, free, peaceful, and prosperous country. And I think that he's believed
*  and his courage. And the fact that he sacrificed his one and the other line for the future of Russia,
*  that's what will become an inspiration for millions of young Russians. I cannot stand
*  with thought that his death wasn't there. And I think that his wife, Julian Abayne,
*  she's going to defend and to carry on the kind of fight that now I may tragically fail to accomplish
*  because she was killed. Jean, what are you going to miss most about your friend about Alexey?
*  He smiled. I'm going to miss his smile. I'm going to miss our conversations. I'm going to miss
*  the friend who was ready to give his hand even from jail. I'm going to miss a politician who was
*  capable to turn my country into a normal, democratic, free, and peaceful country. I still, you know,
*  I sometimes, you know, I just walk around my apartment and I say, I'll quote, Iosha,
*  where are you? It's still hard to comprehend that he's no longer with us. And I'm going to
*  miss my friend. That's why he was my friend of 20 years. You know, the last time I saw him, it
*  wasn't in his penal colony. I was in the summer of 2022 and he came and he hugged me. And I told him,
*  don't worry about your parents. I'm taking care about them. And then I saw how, you know, he
*  walked out of this hall. He was getting into the door that led to this prison barrack. And, you know,
*  a minute ago, he was smiling and he was, you know, saying something funny and encouraging, etc.
*  And I saw how his face became dark. And I was thinking, God, you know, what are they doing to this
*  brilliant human being? How long will he be able to extend all the torture and humiliation?
*  And now, of course, I think how he died. And it makes me sick to think that he died alone,
*  surrounded by all these dirty little people. And I'm so sorry for him. He was just 47 year old.
*  And I think that it is so unfair that an evil guy, an evil person, he lives in comfort.
*  He was though he brings no good to anyone around him. And the only is laying somewhere in the morgue
*  in the Arctic Circle. And there is no sound.
*  Shania, thank you for talking to me. Thank you so much. Good night, Jane. Good night.
*  But the Russian authorities have yet to give Novalny's body back to his family.
*  On Tuesday, his mother, Ludmila Navalnya, stood in front of the Arctic prison where he was being held
*  to demand her son's release.
*  My son.
*  Has ruled that frozen embryos in test tubes should be considered children, a decision that sent
*  shockwaves through the world of reproductive medicine. The ruling issued late last week,
*  stemmed from appeals cases brought by couples in Alabama, whose embryos were destroyed in 2020.
*  On Wednesday, the ruling was already having a profound effect. The University of Alabama
*  at Birmingham Health System announced that it was pausing in vitro fertilization treatments
*  while it evaluated the court's ruling. And the Times reports that President Biden is considering
*  executive action that could prevent people who cross illegally into the United States from claiming
*  asylum. The extraordinary action would put into effect a key policy in a bipartisan bill
*  that Republicans thwarted earlier this month. It is similar to a 2018 effort by then President
*  Donald Trump to stop migration, which was eventually blocked by federal courts.
*  But even if Biden's effort gets stopped in court, a legal fight could allow him to try to neutralize
*  one of his biggest political vulnerabilities, the chaos at the southern border.
