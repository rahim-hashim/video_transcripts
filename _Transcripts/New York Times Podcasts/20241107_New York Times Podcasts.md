# How Democrats Lost Hold of Key Voting Blocs
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGBt0oSNiFI)
*  You just mentioned how much success Donald Trump had with a variety of voting blocks that, as Lisa, you just pointed out, Democrats had long believed were going to remain loyal to them.
*  And but why?
*  But why?
*  Why? Why did they believe that?
*  Like, that evidence has been clear about the drop off for a long time, right?
*  Like, we've had 2016, we've had 2020.
*  Like, we've actually had a lot of evidence to say that the demographic destiny undertone is one that is a faulty premise.
*  The fact that they are holding on to the Obama era, in my opinion, is a racist assumption.
*  I don't say that word, like, I don't mean it like in a capital R way.
*  But I mean, it's a race based assumption.
*  I mean, I think it's, I would say lowercase racist.
*  I would say that there is an assumption that this it was a failure of imagination, that it couldn't be true.
*  I hear you.
*  But I think there is a sense of like, yes, we saw this drumbeat coming.
*  We saw that more people were identifying as Republicans.
*  And like all these polls, we saw that Democrats had moved towards the more conservative position on issues like immigration.
*  We saw that representation did not motivate people.
*  We saw that representation isn't enough.
*  But at the same time, having a black candidate, people don't vote just on representation.
*  There's another half of this, though, which is that Democrats lost sight of why they were winning voters like this in the first place.
*  Thank you. Preach.
*  Which is?
*  Well, one reason that I think is worth mentioning is the economy and helping working people against the establishment and corporations.
*  It was the Democrats who used to be the party that was advocating change, that was against the establishment, that could channel the emotions of a disaffected young person.
*  Donald Trump is that candidate.
*  And so they should in no way be surprised.
