*  Hey, it's Sabrina.
*  This week, the Daily is revisiting some of our favorite episodes of the year, listening
*  back, and then hearing what's happened in the time since they first ran.
*  Today, the fire the devastated Lahaina, Hawaii in August, and one man's story of surviving
*  it.
*  This Tuesday, December 26th.
*  Hello.
*  Hi, is this Idris?
*  Yes, it is.
*  Hi.
*  Idris, thank you for taking the time to talk to us, and I wonder if Idris, if you could introduce
*  yourself for me.
*  Your name, your age, where you live, and what your profession is.
*  My name is Idris Nora, 32 years old.
*  I lived on prison street in Lahaina, and I was the manager, a health and property of the
*  Beech and Pool, working sales.
*  Got it.
*  And I wonder if you could start by telling us just kind of from the beginning, how your
*  day started?
*  So I was my first true day off in the long time, and I woke up in the middle of the night,
*  which was Monday night, Tuesday morning, around 3 to 4 am, when we lost power.
*  So it got pretty hot, so I opened up the windows, and by the time I woke up around 6, 7 am,
*  I noticed we didn't have service neither.
*  Sell service?
*  And honestly, I was just annoyed.
*  I've been waiting for this day off forever, and no power.
*  We didn't even know it was a hurricane.
*  We just thought it was windy.
*  And were you aware of the fire at that point?
*  Absolutely not.
*  There was no fire in the morning, but I was aware of.
*  We had no warnings at all.
*  And so I think it was around noon or one.
*  One of my neighbors came in and knocked on my door and he said, hey, you need to come out
*  and see this.
*  So I came out and it's one of my house.
*  I have a little cottage.
*  Behind my house, I could see a lot of smoke.
*  So I called my cat and I called her and I couldn't find her all day.
*  And then I just gave up and I closed my door.
*  And then my neighbor came back, maybe an hour later, and he said, there's another fire.
*  And it was closer.
*  It was like, he'd been the street behind us.
*  And I was gootter.
*  So I actually want to go check out how close the fire was.
*  And I got on front street, which is a street that goes along the ocean.
*  And I see there's this restaurant up in Slam.
*  And I saw people running and straight in front of me.
*  There's a medical center.
*  And I remember actually seeing a lot of people trying to get into medical center.
*  Didn't behind me does a whole business on fire.
*  It's like, holy, everything was on fire.
*  I didn't understand how things started to catch on fire.
*  It didn't make sense.
*  And now it started to panic.
*  So I went back to the neighbors.
*  But the neighbors were all gone.
*  And I still kind of lost.
*  And the wind, it was wind and it was tree falling down.
*  It screamed for my cat.
*  And I saw her run under the house.
*  And she didn't want to come out.
*  So I was panicking.
*  Reality started to set in.
*  And so I said, OK, maybe the safest place to be right now is here because I wouldn't
*  even know where to go.
*  And so I'm closing the door.
*  And about five minutes, everything turned black outside.
*  A medical center across the street was up his lane to the sky.
*  Oh my God.
*  And I couldn't understand how I just felt people.
*  There was nothing like five, 10 minutes ago.
*  And it really looked like someone put gasoline all over the building.
*  And he just took up and said, you shouldn't extend how like a stone building burns so fast.
*  And so I opened the door, so calling my cat.
*  And I felt something burning on my shoulder.
*  And it was the breed like amber.
*  And I looked up in the sky and said, Larry, fire something down the sky.
*  It was raining fire.
*  And now I said, I have to get out of here.
*  And so I got everything I could.
*  All the necessities, clothes and wallet and pictures or whatever.
*  And put everything in two big bags.
*  And I ran out of the house.
*  And as I ran out of the house, I was smoked everywhere.
*  And I saw one of my neighbors coughing in front of the house.
*  And he was just coughing.
*  And I said, what are you doing here?
*  He's like, oh, I went to the store.
*  I said, OK, let's get on my scooter.
*  So he came behind me on my scooter.
*  And the fire came from the uphill.
*  It was coming down.
*  So to me, the safest place if this fire is watered.
*  And so in the panic, I was like, we have to go to the harbor.
*  And then we got on front street.
*  And on front street, I was just chaos.
*  I could hear screams.
*  And then I couldn't see people.
*  But I could hear them scream, scary screams.
*  Screams of pain I've never heard before.
*  They were clearly people burning alive.
*  Like, it was a deep pain.
*  And people were growing up.
*  And it was horrifying.
*  It was horrifying to hear that.
*  I'm so glad I can see.
*  It was so, it was black because there's so much smoke.
*  But we could clearly hear them all around us.
*  All around us.
*  It fell like we were in hell.
*  We'll be right back.
*  The wind itself, the wind was the scariest thing.
*  The wind was so hot, it was burning us in.
*  It was so strong because everything was on fire.
*  And I told Damon, you got to tell me when to turn to the harbor
*  because I can't see nothing.
*  And so we finally got to the harbor.
*  And I left my scooter there.
*  And I the edge of the water on the harbor
*  is a little, a little house, little, it's called the harbor master's hub.
*  So we had our back against the wall.
*  And we were facing the ocean.
*  And we're just waiting.
*  We just didn't know what to do.
*  Did you say anything to him?
*  No, we were not talking.
*  We didn't know.
*  I mean, in my mind, I'm like, OK, we're going to wait here at least.
*  We're not going to burn.
*  That's what I was thinking.
*  But a couple minutes waiting there, I saw a shadow just running,
*  jumping to water on the side of the house.
*  And I said, Damon, do you see this?
*  And we're looking to water as the big tidbits are drowning in front of us.
*  You know, the big head of yellow eyes.
*  And I didn't want to help him.
*  But I didn't know if he was going to bite me or pull him with him in the water.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, so I kept calling him and calling him, but he couldn't do it.
*  And he tried his best to do it, but he couldn't do it.
*  And I'll never forget the look he gave me and his eyes.
*  He just gave up.
*  And his hay went underwater.
*  And I told Damon to hold my feet.
*  And I took my shirt off.
*  And I somehow managed to grab by the collar and pull them out.
*  And we tried to calm him down.
*  He was just walking in circles.
*  He was in panic mode.
*  And then I called the police.
*  And I said, hey, we're under harbor restock.
*  You guys have to come get us.
*  And the lady was just, she didn't know what to say.
*  She said, I'm sorry.
*  We can't come get you.
*  Everything was in flames.
*  And they were overwhelmed.
*  I hung up.
*  And I just remember seeing debris falling from the sky
*  and our bags kept catching on fire.
*  Miraculous.
*  Yes.
*  So I might phone.
*  I had one bar of service.
*  So I try to call my best friend.
*  You're seen.
*  And I told my best friend, hey, I love you.
*  So everybody, I love them.
*  It's going to be OK.
*  Here's my mom's number.
*  Don't call her now.
*  Wait.
*  Let her sleep.
*  Were you preparing because you thought you might not make it?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  We didn't think we were going to make it.
*  And after I hung up with him, I called the police again.
*  And she gave me the same answer.
*  She said, I'm so sorry.
*  I could feel the frustration in her voice.
*  She was just helpless.
*  She didn't know.
*  And I felt so bad for her because she probably had so many calls
*  like this.
*  And so I hung up again.
*  And I was just frustrated.
*  So at this point, I thought maybe I could get into the harbor
*  mess with her at the little house.
*  Damon had a knife with him.
*  And he cut the screen off.
*  And I started punching the window with all my strength,
*  all my strength.
*  And so I fracture my hand.
*  The window was so thick, it wouldn't even do anything.
*  And so I called the police at third time.
*  And I said, if you guys don't come right now,
*  we're going to die.
*  And she said, you guys have to jump in the water.
*  And I said, no way.
*  You want to jump in a hurricane at night with all this smoke.
*  Like, there's no way we can jump.
*  The water was crazy.
*  And she said, you have no choice.
*  You have to jump in the water.
*  And I hung up.
*  And I looked at Damon.
*  Like, we had to jump.
*  And Damon said, there's no way I'm jumping.
*  I'm not jumping.
*  I told him, listen, either we burn or we drown.
*  And I waited a couple more minutes.
*  I tried to convince him.
*  And I said, you know, I'm jumping.
*  There are rocks, maybe a hundred feet away, or 150 feet.
*  And I finally made it.
*  And I looked back and I screamed at Damon.
*  And he was just terrified.
*  He was next to the dog.
*  And I told him to jump.
*  And I kept screaming.
*  And he said, they want to.
*  And I could see him hanging onto the harbor
*  with half his body in the water.
*  And I kept screaming, you need to let go.
*  You need to let go.
*  And he screamed, my shoes are too heavy.
*  And so I just made a decision to jump and go get him.
*  So I got back in the water.
*  And I got back next to him.
*  I tried to go and take his shoes off.
*  But I couldn't even find his feet to do it.
*  I was like, I'm going to go to the ocean.
*  We're just pushing him against the wall.
*  And I told him you have to follow me.
*  I see.
*  And the way he was swimming, as there's no way he's going to make it,
*  he was just struggling, just swallowing water and coughing.
*  And somehow he managed to get very close to the rock.
*  And I pulled him up.
*  He's overweight.
*  And he's older.
*  It was a miracle.
*  And we still had the brief falling on us.
*  And we had a wave just coming over us.
*  We were holding onto the rocks to not give pull
*  or sucked in by the ocean.
*  And it was just a nightmare.
*  And then I heard it bug screaming.
*  So I was like, I have to go back.
*  And I jumped back into water.
*  I tried to get back on the harbor.
*  He was laying against the wall.
*  His eyes closed.
*  And he was screaming.
*  And there was no way I could care.
*  I was a big pit bull.
*  And I had one.
*  And my hand was fractured or broken.
*  So if I try to grab him in the water, he's already freaked out.
*  We're both going to drown.
*  He's going to die for sure.
*  And I'm probably not going to make it.
*  So one of my bags, I had a blanket.
*  And I dipped it in the ocean five or six times.
*  And I put it on top of the dog.
*  That's all I could do.
*  And I took one of my bags.
*  And I jumped back in the ocean.
*  And then I almost drowned.
*  I was just so exhausted and a panic halfway.
*  And I was praying to God, he's helped me.
*  And I think I made it to the jetty.
*  And I went back on the other side.
*  And I talked to them.
*  And he was not answering.
*  And I grabbed his hand.
*  And he just held my hand.
*  He was just in shock.
*  And then maybe an hour after that, I saw light, you know,
*  far away.
*  And I told them, and I said, hey, I think there's a boat over there.
*  And we were like screaming.
*  I was screaming at the top of my lungs.
*  And they were like coming towards us.
*  I thank God.
*  And it was the code guard.
*  And they were like, we can't get close.
*  You guys have to jump in the water.
*  Because it was so rough.
*  They were crashing the rocks.
*  And I jumped first.
*  And they got me in.
*  I just lay down on my back.
*  And I could just see Amber just falling on us.
*  Like this guy had no stars.
*  The Amber were the stars.
*  Red stars in the sky.
*  That's what it looked like.
*  Just a black guy with red stars is falling down.
*  I was falling on the ocean, but I felt like I was falling in space.
*  I was thanking God.
*  I said, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  I don't deserve this.
*  I really just, it was just unbelievable that we made it.
*  And Damon, he managed to make it.
*  And I was like, thank God, we made it.
*  And I said, oh, how do you guys find us?
*  And they said, we got to call someone
*  might be on the harbor.
*  So I think that lady, she relayed the call and finally got to us.
*  And I said, thank God we made it.
*  And he said, oh, no, not yet.
*  We still have to go through the storm.
*  And I said, where are we going?
*  And he said, we don't know everything's on fire.
*  And I looked behind me and there was just, it was just,
*  it looked like war.
*  It was just claimed up to the sky the whole town and the end of darkness.
*  So we got to Maui High School.
*  They made a shelter there.
*  And then when we arrived, of course, we were like covering
*  soup and all black.
*  So anyone was looking at us.
*  And I was barefoot, the people kept staring at my feet.
*  Everybody knew where the ones we survived.
*  Everybody that was in the shelter or the lucky ones.
*  After the break, senior producer Lindsey Garrison shares an update on Idris, a survivor of
*  Lahain as fire.
*  I called Idris back in late November.
*  He talked to me from a hotel.
*  He said he'd been living in hotels for more than three months, waiting for FEMA.
*  To secure him in a apartment.
*  Have you been moved from hotel to hotel since we talked?
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  How many hotels?
*  Two, and I actually ended up because they made a mistake and I ended up homeless for
*  night.
*  So yeah, it's been hard for everyone.
*  And I'm not blaming FEMA or, you know, I don't, they don't know.
*  But it is very hard for us.
*  It's really hard to live in a hotel room for that long, you know, even down on every
*  day.
*  Not the most, that's last time.
*  And also like, if you leave your hotel room for more than two or three days and you
*  lose that room, you know, so you can't even go and visit family.
*  You can't do anything.
*  It really feels like playing jail.
*  Do you do anything to give yourself some relief from just feeling stuck?
*  She don't want to know.
*  Absolutely nothing.
*  I'm just in my room as you may.
*  You know, everyone displays to my friends are on the other side and you're like, you
*  don't have a car.
*  And, you know, it's kind of hard to go to the beach by yourself.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's a weird feeling.
*  You know, I have multiple friends that I moved.
*  Love their job, love their home.
*  I perceive up my job as well because I was, I'm displaced.
*  And, you know, a lot of us are still mourning and, you know, they're still in shock.
*  And they're reopened for tourists.
*  But it's kind of like attending a funeral and you having a party next door.
*  Like you're walking and everyone's happy and everyone's drinking and, you know, and
*  music and you're there and you feel like it goes.
*  Like not really in the mood.
*  So it's a weird feeling.
*  Yeah.
*  It's going to be a long time before the high night goes back to where I was.
*  And it's never going to be.
*  I was.
*  Did you ever find anything out about the pit bull that you tried to save?
*  No.
*  So my cat is still missing and an empty bull.
*  And still missing.
*  I still have a little hope.
*  I know my friend, they just found her cat like a week ago.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, they're still finding a lot of path.
*  So I don't know if my cat was that fortunate, but people are telling me not to lose hope.
*  I hope they both turn up.
*  Me too.
*  Me too.
*  I really hope too.
*  Yeah.
*  Can you sort of envision what your ideal future or your ideal life would look like there?
*  In the coming months?
*  Well, it's hard because I was living my dream before all this happened.
*  So it's hard for me to like think of a better situation that I had before.
*  You know, but I think my hope would be, you know, to get my place and hopefully find
*  my cat and then start moving down from there.
*  It's just it's kind of hard right now to imagine about anything.
*  Yeah.
*  And as the hardest part, the hardest thing is not to know.
