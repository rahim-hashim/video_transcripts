# Who Blew Up the Nord Stream Pipelines?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8O2-CxDeQY)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is a daily.
*  Today, a Times investigation may finally answer the question of who carried out a brazen wartime
*  attack on two underwater pipelines connecting Russia and Europe.
*  My colleague Julian Barnes says it's not who anyone first suspected.
*  It's Wednesday, March 8th.
*  So Julian, you have been digging into one of the central mysteries of the war in Ukraine,
*  the suspected bombing of the Nord Stream underwater pipeline.
*  And you think you now know who did it.
*  Yeah, we think we do know.
*  Okay, well, I am going to ask you, and I am being a little bit coy here, not to tell us
*  who you think it now is just yet, because we have 20 minutes of the show to film.
*  Also, because I think it makes sense to start with the story of the pipeline itself, why
*  it is so important and why its explosion became such an international event.
*  Absolutely.
*  I mean, arguably, Michael, there's no piece of energy infrastructure in Europe that's
*  more important than the Nord Stream pipelines.
*  Remember, there are actually two pipelines here.
*  Nord Stream 1, which has been active for a decade, and Nord Stream 2, which was all but
*  complete together, the majority of the natural gas that Europe uses was going to flow through
*  these pipelines.
*  From Russia.
*  From Russia.
*  And these are very important projects.
*  They tied Russia and Europe together.
*  They made Russia the most important energy supplier for Europe.
*  And so when Russia decides to invade Ukraine, the pipelines become a major focal point.
*  Right, because in a sense, Russia, by this point, through these pipelines, had gotten
*  Europe kind of addicted to its fuel, which ended up, of course, helping fund Russia's
*  invasion of Ukraine and makes it a lot harder for Europe to turn its back on Russia over
*  the invasion because it needs this energy.
*  Right.
*  Europe had become dependent on Russia, dependent on its natural gas, dependent on its energy
*  supplies and that complicated relations that made taking a tough stand against Russia more
*  difficult.
*  Right.
*  But Europe does.
*  It takes a tough stand against Russia, risking all that energy.
*  And remind us what happens to the pipeline after the war starts and after Europe decides
*  that it's going to punish Russia for the invasion.
*  So initially, the gas is still flowing through one of the pipelines.
*  But then Russia has now turned off its supply of natural gas into the rest of Europe.
*  And Russian officials say the Nord Stream pipeline will stay off.
*  Russia starts monkeying with it.
*  They start changing the flow.
*  They turn it off.
*  They turn it on.
*  They're exerting leverage over Europe through the pipeline.
*  Right.
*  We have seen natural gas supply dwindle.
*  We have seen prices spike.
*  And then something even stranger happens.
*  Scientists recorded explosions in the Baltic Sea before detecting three simultaneous leaks.
*  In late September of last year, in the middle of the night, there's an explosion at the
*  bottom of the Baltic Sea.
*  Gas bubbles churn the Baltic Sea.
*  70 meters below sea level, gas is escaping from the Nord Stream pipelines.
*  It's large enough to be detected miles away.
*  The pipelines operator reported a drop in pressure.
*  The pressure drops inside the pipelines.
*  The pipelines are taken offline.
*  The pipeline operator says that damage is unprecedented.
*  Something big has happened.
*  Their initial reports indicating that this may be the result of an attack or some kind
*  of sabotage.
*  But these are initial reports and we haven't confirmed that yet.
*  It becomes clear that they've been attacked.
*  The possibility is trying to sabotage the pipelines.
*  And the question is, who?
*  Right.
*  And it kind of feels, and I remember this moment, that the possibilities are seemingly
*  endless, right?
*  Not endless, but there are a lot of suspects right away.
*  Well, remind us of the early theories of who tried to sabotage these pipelines.
*  Well, a lot of officials immediately started talking about the possibility that Russia
*  did this.
*  Hmm.
*  These are officials in the United States.
*  These are officials in Poland.
*  I mean, after all, it was Russia that had been monkeying around with the flow of gas
*  through Nord Stream 1.
*  They had already shown a willingness to sort of interfere in energy supplies to Europe.
*  And so the logic of these officials, they said Russia has the means to do this.
*  They have the ability to do complex underwater operations.
*  And they also have a motivation to mess with Europe, to interfere with European energy
*  supplies to punish Europe for its support of Ukraine.
*  Right.
*  And, you know, a lot of officials had been on the lookout for a Russian sabotage campaign.
*  This is something that American officials had been predicting Russia might do, not necessarily
*  the pipeline, but other acts of sabotage inside Europe.
*  But as compelling as this theory is, it would require Russia to not just monkey around with
*  this pipeline, but to destroy this expensive pipeline that it built at a cost of billions
*  of dollars, which would just be weird.
*  Right.
*  I mean, who destroys their own pipeline?
*  It's a big logical hole in the theory.
*  Not only does Russia not have an incentive to destroy its own infrastructure, by blowing
*  up the pipeline, they suddenly lose their leverage.
*  They just permanently cut off their ability to influence European energy use.
*  Right.
*  Remember, Putin operates through leverage, through influence, you know, and he's much
*  more of a leader who would turn it on and turn it off.
*  And blowing it up is a very final act that takes leverage away from Russia.
*  Okay.
*  So what does Russia say about this allegation?
*  They say it's crazy.
*  They say this is a baseless accusation against them.
*  Now, the Russian government doesn't have a huge amount of credibility with anyone, but
*  that doesn't stop the Kremlin from pointing at the UK and then saying, maybe the US did
*  And is that a legitimate theory that anyone else in the world finds intriguing that the
*  US could have possibly done it?
*  It is a theory that some people latch on to right away.
*  And why would they latch on to it?
*  The US has always hated these pipelines.
*  They were unsuccessful in trying to stop the first one.
*  They lobbied really hard to prevent Nord Stream 2 from ever coming online.
*  They've always been really uncomfortable with the leverage that the pipelines give Russia.
*  You know, it gives Russia a kind of veto over some actions Europe might want to take.
*  So in this theory, the US so despises the idea of the Nord Stream pipelines from the
*  start and so takes the opportunity in the middle of the war to sabotage the pipelines
*  and probably suspects that everybody will blame Russia, which is a kind of bonus.
*  That's the theory, right?
*  The theory of why the US might have a motivation to do it.
*  And after all, even President Biden has said some things about this pipeline that have
*  given people pause, have made some people think that the US was making a threat against
*  the pipeline.
*  What did he say?
*  I'll take a couple of questions each.
*  Reuters, Andrea, you had the first question.
*  Thank you, Mr. President.
*  And thank you, Chancellor Schultz.
*  In February, in the weeks before the invasion of Ukraine, Biden is meeting at the White
*  House with the German chancellor and the pipeline is a big part of their discussions.
*  Germany is a country that is most dependent on the pipeline and Russian gas.
*  And so it's a sort of natural focus of the conversation.
*  Did you receive assurances from Chancellor Schultz today that Germany will, in fact,
*  pull the plug on this project if Russia invades Ukraine?
*  And he was asked about Nord Stream 2.
*  Let me answer the first question first.
*  He said, if Russia invades Ukraine,
*  There will be no longer a Nord Stream 2.
*  We will bring an end to it.
*  There will no longer be a Nord Stream 2.
*  How will you do that since the project and control of the project is within Germany's
*  control?
*  And then he added,
*  We will, I promise you, we'll be able to do it.
*  I promise you, we'll be able to do it.
*  Which sounds a little bit like a threat to possibly end the viability of this pipeline.
*  To many people, it did sound like a threat.
*  It sounded like the US was willing to take action.
*  So a reasonably compelling second theory of who is behind the sabotaging of this pipeline.
*  What has been the response from the Biden administration to this theory?
*  The Biden administration has consistently denied it.
*  They have said repeatedly, there is no truth to any theory that the US attacked the pipeline.
*  Right, which is what you'd expect the US government to say.
*  So is there, Julian, any other compelling theory besides Russia or the United States?
*  Well, some people started to wonder, what about Ukraine?
*  Hmm.
*  Right, and there the motive seems kind of clear.
*  Ukraine is looking for any opportunity to get back at Russia for invading their country.
*  That's right.
*  Ukraine wants to do anything it can to hurt Russia.
*  And it's very important to Keefe that they lessen Europe's dependency on Russia.
*  They don't want any conflict.
*  They just want Europe to support them.
*  Got it.
*  So there are now many reasonable suspects here, all of whom, because they are nations
*  with militaries, would definitely have the capacity to pull off these underwater explosions
*  that occurred with Nord Stream.
*  That's right.
*  But as we started looking into this, it became clear that it wasn't any of these countries
*  that was responsible.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Julian, who exactly was responsible for this attack?
*  And how did you and our colleagues go about figuring that out?
*  Well, I think what happened was for much of the investigation, we weren't asking exactly
*  the right questions.
*  And what were the right questions?
*  Well, we had logically been focused on countries, all those states that we just went through.
*  Did Russia do it?
*  Did the Ukraine state do it?
*  And that was just hitting dead end after dead end.
*  We weren't finding officials who were telling us that there was credible evidence pointing
*  at a government.
*  So my colleagues, Adam Entus, Adam Goldman, and I started asking a different question.
*  Could this have been done by non-state actors?
*  Could this have been done by a group of individuals who were not working for a government?
*  Kind of like freelance saboteurs.
*  So where did you take this new question?
*  Well, we started asking, who might these saboteurs be?
*  Or if we couldn't answer that, who might they be aligned with?
*  Could they be pro-Russian saboteurs?
*  Could they be other saboteurs?
*  And the more we talked to officials who had access to intelligence, the more we saw this
*  theory gaining traction.
*  And my initial thought that this could be pro-Russian saboteurs turned out to be wrong.
*  And we learned that it was most likely a pro-Ukrainian group.
*  So in other words, a group of people who did this on behalf of Ukraine, what do you learn
*  that makes you think that's what happened?
*  Michael, I should be very clear that we know really very little, right?
*  This group remains mysterious, and it remains mysterious not just to us, but also to the
*  US government officials that we have spoken to.
*  They know that the people involved were either Ukrainian or Russian or a mix.
*  They know that they are not affiliated with the Ukrainian government, but they know they're
*  also anti-Putin and pro-Ukraine.
*  Hmm.
*  So after all this investigative reporting, what you find is that the culprit here is
*  a group of people who want the same thing as Ukraine but aren't officially tied to the
*  government of Ukraine.
*  But I'm curious how certain you are that these individuals are not connected to the
*  Ukrainian government.
*  Well, the intelligence right now says they're not.
*  And while officials are telling us that the president of Ukraine and his key advisors
*  did not know, we can't be certain that that's true or that somebody else didn't know.
*  After all, there's been a series of mysterious attacks inside Russia that initially no one
*  knew who did them, but then it came out that the Ukrainian government was responsible.
*  Now here, the intelligence is not saying that, but new information could come to light.
*  That changes our understanding.
*  In other words, there's precedent for it actually being Ukraine when perhaps at first they're
*  being coy or even denying it.
*  And if new information comes out, and we do think that this was Ukraine, not a group
*  disconnected from Ukraine, what exactly is that going to mean given everything we've
*  been talking about here?
*  What would be the repercussions of us learning that?
*  Well, the repercussions of that would be big.
*  If the Ukrainian government somehow knew about this or somehow gave permission for this group
*  individuals to carry this out, it would have a big impact on the anti-Russia alliance.
*  This could break apart NATO solidarity over the support of Ukraine, or it could at least
*  weaken it.
*  And the reason that would be, just to be sure I understand, is because Europe would then
*  face the reality that after all this work it's done to shore up Ukraine, Ukraine is
*  trying to make Europe's energy situation even more vulnerable.
*  That would be Ukraine biting the hand that has quite literally fed it throughout this war.
*  That's a good way of putting it.
*  Exactly that.
*  It would be Ukraine biting the hand that feeds it.
*  And Ukraine is very, very dependent on that aid.
*  Obviously, the United States support is the most important, but Europe's support is critical
*  too.
*  They're getting tanks from Germany.
*  They're getting all kinds of support from Europe that they need to fight the war in
*  the months to come.
*  So it is very much in Ukraine's interest that we never find out, or that it never be true,
*  that they had a hand in this.
*  It's much better that it's the case that these were kind of sympathetic people to Ukraine
*  who never took orders, never consulted with, never briefed the government of Ukraine.
*  That's true, but it's also a reason why the Ukraine government might not be involved,
*  why this might be different than the other covert acts.
*  The Ukrainian government is not a bunch of idiots.
*  They know how damaging it would be to this alliance if they had done this.
*  And so that is one reason some US officials really do believe that this group of people
*  was acting independently.
*  On the other hand, throughout this war, new information has come out to light and it has
*  changed our understanding.
*  So we need to be open to that possibility.
*  So Julian, thinking back to the larger question of motivations here, the Nord Stream pipelines
*  have been down now for months.
*  And during that period, Europe has not suffered immensely for lack of Russian energy.
*  So if you are the people behind this attack, these non-state actors sympathetic to Ukraine,
*  I wonder if this is looking like a success because it has helped illustrate that Europe
*  doesn't need Russian energy and might not need these Nord Stream pipelines.
*  And that is pretty good for Ukraine.
*  Europe over the last year has weaned itself off of Russian gas, right?
*  It's a much less important source of energy.
*  And that's a huge win for Ukraine.
*  It really reduces the leverage that Russia has over Europe.
*  And we can see a sort of more full-throated support that European powers have for Ukraine.
*  So the possibility exists that whoever did this accomplished something with their sabotage.
*  Well, Julian, thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to another day.
*  In his annual budget, President Biden will propose extending the financial solvency of
*  Medicare, the federal health insurance program for older Americans, by raising a tax on those
*  earning more than $400,000.
*  The proposal would help finance the program for another 25 years, but faces fierce resistance
*  from congressional Republicans.
*  Nevertheless, by focusing on the issue, Biden can cast himself as a protector of the cherished
*  and blame Republicans for putting it at risk.
*  And...
*  We allege that if allowed to proceed, this merger will limit choices and drive up ticket
*  prices for passengers across the country.
*  The Justice Department has filed a lawsuit seeking to stop JetBlue Airways from buying
*  its rival Spirit Airlines, arguing that the $3.8 billion deal would reduce competition
*  in an industry that badly needs it.
*  Four airlines, American, Delta, United and Southwest, control close to 80% of the market.
*  In response, JetBlue argues that consumers stand to benefit from the acquisition because
*  it would make the combined airline capable of better competing with the nation's four
*  largest carriers and ultimately force them to lower their prices.
