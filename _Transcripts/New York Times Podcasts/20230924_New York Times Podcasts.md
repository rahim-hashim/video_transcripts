# The Sunday Read: ‘The Kidnapped Child Who Became a Poet’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZbaQ8ewHnY)
*  My name is Wyatt Mason, and I'm a contributing writer for the New York Times Magazine.
*  This week's Sunday read is my recent article for the magazine about the 48-year-old American
*  poet Shane McCray.
*  Since 2009, McCray has published 13 collections of verse, some 800 pages of supremely accomplished
*  work.
*  He writes deeply about race, about marriage, and about sin and purgation.
*  Through it all, he's been exploring the complexities of his biography, an exploration which prompts
*  this latest piece of mine on the occasion of his just-published memoir, Pulling the
*  Chariot of the Sun.
*  McCray explores the extraordinary events of his childhood when he was kidnapped at age
*  from his black father by his white maternal grandparents.
*  They took him from Salem, Oregon to just outside of Austin, Texas, raising him under the premise
*  that his father had abandoned him before he was born.
*  They also tried to keep McCray's racial identity from him, raising this black kid with the
*  understanding that he was a white kid who just tanned easily.
*  He was brought up in this brutal, racist household by a grandfather who beat him and lied to
*  him and by a grandmother who, as much as she showed him love, was also a wildly manipulative
*  influence, brutal in her own way.
*  McCray's personal history was a nightmare from which he doubted he could awake.
*  McCray's memoir is a very complicated piece of prose.
*  Some episodes are told many times, attempts by McCray to understand what might have happened.
*  My story for the magazine explores all of that, but it also goes to another place that
*  was unexpected for me as a writer.
*  There was a different burden on my part from when I write about novelists.
*  I needed, in a basic way, to fact check the story, not out of a sense of suspicion so
*  much as due diligence.
*  I needed to speak with any of the people who were implicated in or involved with his kidnapping.
*  Needless to say, the first people I thought of were the grandparents, but they were dead,
*  so I asked McCray how he would feel if I were to reach out to his parents, both of whom
*  are alive, neither of whom had really spoken to the other in a quarter of a century.
*  McCray expressed some hesitation, but ultimately he said yes.
*  I ended up speaking with each of his parents many times over the course of a month, attempting
*  to reconcile differing accounts by McCray's mother, Denise, and his father, Stanley, of
*  events that happened more than forty years ago.
*  McCray's memoir works towards a moment, late in the book, of extraordinary synchronicity,
*  when as a teenager he realized that poetry was going to be the thing he would spend his
*  life doing.
*  It's a thrilling sequence of events, movingly told, that I won't spoil here.
*  But what's particularly amazing is McCray's clear-sightedness, even as a teen, about what
*  it was going to take for him to learn what a poet can do.
*  He recognized that he was going to need to read compulsively, exhaustively, and so one
*  of the things that distinguishes McCray is how clearly his artistry is a hard-won consequence
*  not of his biography, but of his work ethic.
*  Beginning when he was a teenager, he kept to a rigorous course of autodidacticism, reading
*  eight books at a time, twenty-five pages from each, two hundred pages a day.
*  He needed to take all that in, he understood, if he was going to be able to write his way
*  to where he wanted to go.
*  In reporting this story, I learned once again that a great artist isn't somebody who sits
*  there waiting for inspiration to happen.
*  Rather, they find a way, their own way, to work, tirelessly.
*  McCray's path to poetry is unique, however, and his memoir charts his movement through
*  the years of despair and drift that began when he was kidnapped from his father.
*  Taken, essentially, because his white grandparents didn't want him to be raised by a black man,
*  as a black man.
*  To survive all that and to thrive after it, what would it take?
*  And where, as a poet, would it take him?
*  So here's my article, The Kidnapped Child Who Became a Poet, read by Prentiss Onayemi.
*  The Weird Thing About Growing Up Kidnapped, Shane McCray, the forty-seven-year-old American
*  poet told me in his melodious, reedy voice one rainy afternoon in May, is if it happens
*  early enough, there's a way in which you kind of don't know.
*  There was no reason for McCray to have known.
*  It unfolded in McCray's childhood between a June day in 1979 when his white grandmother
*  took him from his black father and disappeared, and another day, thirteen years later, when
*  McCray opened a phone book in Salem, Oregon, found a name he hoped was his father's and
*  placed a call.
*  It's both an unambiguous story of abduction and a convoluted story of complicity.
*  It loops through the American landscape from Oregon to Texas to California to Oregon again
*  and even now, wends through the vaster emotional country of a child and his parents.
*  And because so much of what happened to McCray happened in homes where he was beaten and
*  lied to and threatened, where he was made to understand that black people were inferior
*  to whites, where he was taught to hail Hitler, where he was told that his dark skin meant
*  he tanned easily, but no, not that he was black.
*  It's a story that's been hard for McCray to piece together.
*  My grandparents, McCray explained in a somewhat gloomy, book-laden office at Columbia University
*  where he teaches poetry in its MFA program, were so actively keeping my father away from
*  me they didn't want me to investigate him at all.
*  It was just normal.
*  Normal, McCray explained, because the story he had been told by his grandparents was that
*  McCray's father, whose name he didn't even know, abandoned him before he was born.
*  They had been doing it my whole life, McCray said matter-of-factly.
*  I didn't think of it as, oh, this is pretty strange.
*  McCray paused.
*  The after effects of all that, he continued, it took me until to really understand that
*  I had been a kidnapped child, probably my early 40s when it finally started to make
*  sense and I really got it, and I was like, oh, this is a big deal.
*  I had used the phrase before, growing up kidnapped, but somehow used it without it really sinking
*  in.
*  It was a thing that I was aware of as this is technically true, but without really understanding
*  what that means.
*  McCray's new book, The Memoir, Pulling the Chariot of the Sun, it is being released on
*  August 1st, is his attempt to construct, at a remove of four decades, an understanding
*  of what happened and what it has come to mean.
*  The memoir takes the reader through McCray's childhood, from his earliest memories after
*  being taken from his father, to when, at 16, he found him again.
*  Like many accomplished memoirs that have followed from St. Augustine's pioneering Confessions,
*  this explores memories on certain contours, but like few memoirs before it, Pulling the
*  Chariot of the Sun offers the experience, in prose, of that uncertainty.
*  It's essentially a 250-page avant-garde prose poem that has more in common with Virginia
*  Woolf's excellent, difficult novel, The Waves, than with Hwa Soo's excellent, not difficult
*  memoir, Stay True, or any memoir you might name.
*  These sentences are constantly stating and retracting, moving forward and retreating,
*  establishing a perimeter around an event while trying to penetrate it, to enter the chalk
*  outline drawn around a body long buried, that of the boy McCray was before he was taken.
*  At first, the mode can be off-putting.
*  Decisions and revisions that a minute can reverse, the reader left to wonder why the
*  same story, McCray's birth, say, as it was reported to him, is told multiple times.
*  But it's not long before the initial aesthetic perplexity resolves for the reader into the
*  recognition that this is how a mind works with the best.
*  Eternal return, compulsive attempts to make something hold over which you have no control.
*  And then the reader begins to welcome, need, in fact, McCray's multiplicities, that straining
*  for resolution.
*  The memoir accumulates a hugeness of feeling that puts a lie to the idea that difficulty
*  in a piece of writing is necessarily cold or aloof, or incompatible with the kind of
*  intense emotion that McCray's narrative uncommonly yields.
*  Until I was 13, I slept with the light on, McCray writes midway through the memoir.
*  The main light in my bedroom, the light in the ceiling, sometimes still wearing the clothes
*  I had worn that day, sometimes even wearing my shoes.
*  Most of my childhood, I felt I had to be prepared to be taken from my life at any moment.
*  Pulling the chariot of the sun is the story of an undoing, but it is no less a story of
*  becoming.
*  McCray takes the reader to the house where he was made to live with his grandparents,
*  documents how he was thrown at age three into a wall by his grandfather because he was crying
*  for his father, how he was knocked unconscious, how the beatings continued as McCray matured
*  until his grandmother divorced the grandfather when McCray was 14.
*  There are visits from his mother and his brief failed period living with her as a teenager,
*  time at multiple schools, three and ninth grade alone, where he sat at the backs of
*  rooms, a middling student, largely friendless.
*  But there is also the freedom and pleasure he experienced skateboarding, at which he
*  excelled enough to be able to see, vividly, the fine line that separated his skills from
*  those of skaters who became pros.
*  And there's McCray's revelation, as a 10th grader who would go on to repeat the year,
*  that a standardized test put his writing at an eighth grade level, the metrics of the
*  world reporting that he was, contrary to his sense of himself, stupid.
*  Seated within that plausible sadness and loneliness and horror and hopelessness is
*  the story of the strange concatenation of events that produced the moment when McCray
*  found his path to poetry, first as anchor to life and then as avenue to himself.
*  His memoir is therefore, and perhaps most memorably, a Bildungsroman, a portrait of
*  a poet as a young black man, a boy raised in a particular crucible of capture that,
*  as part of its power, enacts the American story of seizure and captivity of black people
*  by white tormentors.
*  McCray dropped out of high school and got an equivalency diploma.
*  By 19, he was on his own, married, father of a daughter, but without a clear path forward,
*  only a clear ambition to write poetry.
*  Through that period, he kept to a strict regimen of reading 200 pages a day, eight books at
*  once in rotation, 25 pages from each, absorbing writing from every era, understanding that,
*  beyond his need to make it, he knew nothing about poetry.
*  What he did know, having been an excellent skateboarder, was that if you wanted to land
*  a reverse ollie, you needed your 10,000 hours to get there.
*  He entered community college at 21.
*  After transferring twice, he graduated from a good local college, Linfield, at 26, with
*  an acceptance letter from the premier MFA program in the world, the Iowa Writers Workshop.
*  Graduating in 2004, he went straight to Harvard Law School to get a JD, thinking that he would
*  briefly support himself as a lawyer.
*  McCray didn't like law school, but completed it, and as he was doing so, because he could
*  take courses elsewhere at the university, he applied for a place in the poetry workshop
*  of a poet he had been reading for years, Jory Graham.
*  It seemed at the start that he didn't know if he should be there, if he wanted to be
*  there, Graham wrote to me.
*  But as we say, he had an ear.
*  He wrote a slightly conventional poem, and his heart was tight, and his natural voice
*  was through clenched teeth.
*  I felt anger on his page, repressed anger.
*  I felt he had been beaten down by some great force, some injustice beyond the injustice
*  of being black in America, but I could not break through to it.
*  At some point, he came to me in my office with a strange draft where a few lines broke
*  apart at what would have been prosodical caesuras, and as we spoke, he shared a great personal
*  grief and burden, and I remember this vividly.
*  I looked back and forth from his broad, open, suddenly vulnerable face to the lines broken
*  open by a kind of stuttering breath, or a breath taken to squelch a sob, and I thought,
*  here it is, here we go.
*  His ear is released.
*  The next week, he had a handful of poems in that form.
*  The form worked because it correlated to the griefs he was undergoing.
*  Since 2009, McCray has published 13 books of poetry, hundreds of pages of supremely
*  accomplished verse.
*  He has written autobiographically on the dissolution of marriage and the challenges of fatherhood,
*  on the reality of racism as he has encountered it and as American history has fostered it,
*  and on sin and its purgation and transcendence, not in some abstract mode, but from a decidedly
*  Christian perspective.
*  McCray is a practicing Episcopalian, but these are just themes.
*  Every poet has them, and they say nothing about what might make verse notable, durable.
*  It is McCray's own deep knowledge and use of the history of poetic form that has marked
*  his work and made it identifiably his own.
*  McCray has written scores of sonnets with the form's standard 70 beats and its characteristic
*  meter of iambic pentameter, and yet a reader encountering these poems for the first time
*  on the page, where they do not look like sonnets, the lines are ruptured, gapped, slashed, broken
*  at the wrong places, would be hard pressed to see a sonnet's shape hiding there in plain
*  sight.
*  But as you not so much push through them as are pulled along by the currents in them,
*  a freight of feeling accumulates and by the end of his best poems, detonates in final
*  lines that are often so aggressively felt that you hardly notice the rigor of the meter
*  that has gotten you there.
*  I tend to think that poems, McCray told me, they're smarter than the people who write
*  them, and they're smarter than the people that read them.
*  A poem that is successful is a poem that you can never entirely possess.
*  It will always resist you through its sort of fathomless difficulty.
*  That there's always going to be some new thing with the poem, because you haven't gotten
*  the whole thing.
*  Many of McCray's poems have addressed the pain in his own biography.
*  The first poem, The Cardinal is the Marriage Bird, in his first major book, Mule, ends
*  with the word Wound.
*  A suite of poems follows in which McCray takes on the role of the book's title animal, Sired,
*  Black, Damned, White, poems set in the Texas to which he was taken.
*  He's written three different poems, all called Mulado, a word the Spanish root of which means
*  Young Mule, capturing a boy's awareness of the rupture at the center of his nature.
*  Or Niggers on TV, a harrowing but also strangely tender poem that captures the effects of his
*  grandfather's racism.
*  On a little boy who liked to dance along with the Huxtabels when the Cosby show came on,
*  With his grandmother, I only ever saw her dance with me, which not at all incidentally
*  dances along in iambic pentameter, a complicated act of love nesting within the horror.
*  Over the years, McCray has burrowed into the ugliness of how whites have treated blacks,
*  imagining the voices of historical figures like Jim Limber, a mixed-race orphan adopted
*  by the family of Jefferson Davis at the end of his time as president of the Confederacy.
*  Unreconcilable depictions of violence and love.
*  All the while, McCray has nudged closer to exploring the grotesquerie of his own treatment.
*  Earlier poems using the word taken before the newer poems incorporated, finally, the
*  word that McCray knows to be true, kidnapped.
*  I wondered why McCray felt he needed now to approach this history, already glimpsed in
*  his mature work through narrative.
*  Up until that point, McCray told me, I wrote stuff that I figured one would write.
*  Being as how I was kidnapped, what is the sort of thing a person who was kidnapped would
*  say?
*  In a lot of my poems, that's the way I was thinking about it.
*  But it wasn't until I wrote the memoir that I started to understand that it wasn't like
*  being kidnapped was someone running up to you every day and shouting, hey, you're kidnapped.
*  Which is what the moment of the poem kind of feels like.
*  A dramatization.
*  Being kidnapped is just, you're living your life and no one is telling you what the premise
*  is.
*  I used to think that there was something wrong with my emotional life, McCray told me later,
*  conjuring up feelings about like when my grandmother died from complications of Alzheimer's while
*  he was in law school.
*  I was like, okay, well, here's something I'm supposed to feel.
*  And I couldn't.
*  I was aware that being taken from my father when I was and my subsequent experiences really
*  broke something in my ability to connect with family that is generationally before me.
*  What I feel is the absence of feeling things that I should.
*  As I sought to fill in McCray's early years, I felt I needed to speak with his mother and
*  father.
*  He expressed some hesitation, however, and before he ultimately said it would be fine
*  with him and with them if I did, I spoke with one of McCray's high school teachers who shifted
*  those conversations in an unexpected direction.
*  The day after we spoke, she texted yearbook photos from when McCray would have been in
*  ninth and tenth grade.
*  There he was in two adolescent shots a year apart.
*  His name was listed not as McCray, but as Baker.
*  Oh, yes, that's right.
*  Denise Baker, McCray's mom, told me on the phone from her home in Portland, Oregon.
*  Baker was Shane's last name.
*  Baker was the name of her stepfather, Morris, whom everyone called Maury and whom Denise
*  called during our conversations, the monster.
*  He was her mother's fifth and final husband.
*  They married when Denise was five.
*  Denise says that when she was still small, he kicked her down a hallway so hard that
*  it felt as if he broke her tailbone.
*  When she became a teenager, they fought outright.
*  He was a racist, and she had black friends.
*  Things got bad.
*  Her mom and Maury called her fat, worthless, stupid.
*  She repeatedly ran away.
*  When she was around 14, her parents told the state that she was out of control, and
*  she was remanded to juvenile detention for a year.
*  After she got out, she was emancipated from her parents.
*  They didn't want to have to take care of me anymore, Denise told me.
*  Denise talked about meeting McCray's father, Stanley, about which McCray writes in the
*  memoir.
*  How his eventual father approached her slowly from an impossible distance, somehow both
*  in and beyond the Kmart, dressed, she would say, like Superfly.
*  She would have been 15.
*  He was most likely 17 or 18.
*  She never told me what he ordered.
*  She never told me what they talked about.
*  As to why three years later, Shane was born a baker and not a McCray, as Denise tells
*  it, a hospital staff member said that because she and Stanley weren't married, he wouldn't
*  be able to put his name on the form.
*  If he wanted to claim paternity, he could within six months if he filed a formal application.
*  Soon after she was released from the hospital, she and Shane joined Stanley in Salem.
*  We hung out and talked, Stanley told me from his home in San Diego.
*  I'm like, when do I need to sign the birth certificate?
*  And she was like, well, actually, I wanted to talk to you about that because my dad,
*  Morrie, can't have kids.
*  And he was saying that if you let him put Shane in the Baker name,
*  when he passes, everything he has will go to Shane.
*  And I'm like, really?
*  Because I'm not a rich man.
*  She said yes.
*  And I'm like, okay, he can be in the Baker name.
*  When he gets older, if he wants to change it, he can change it.
*  So this is, to me, where the story began.
*  All of a sudden, he's in the Baker name.
*  It wasn't long after the birth that Denise and
*  Stanley were no longer in a romantic relationship.
*  Shane was initially with Denise in Portland.
*  Sometimes she stayed with her parents who were living there.
*  By the time McCray was nearing three, Denise began to feel overwhelmed by
*  the responsibility of being a parent, afraid that she was going to be abusive
*  to Shane the way her parents had been to her.
*  Not long after, Stanley took Shane to Salem to live with him.
*  On June 2nd, 1979, Stanley's grandfather died.
*  He told Denise he wanted to take Shane to the funeral in Arizona.
*  Denise said that was fine.
*  Probably that same day, Stanley recalled, the grandmother came over.
*  I had bought Shane this little tricycle and he just loved it.
*  We were outside playing.
*  He's riding on the tricycle.
*  The grandmother pulls up and says, I'd like to see him before he leaves.
*  I'm like, yeah, absolutely.
*  We're not leaving for a couple of days.
*  And she says, well, can he spend the night?
*  I'm like, no problem, no problem.
*  And she's like, I'll bring him back tomorrow.
*  I thought nothing at all.
*  But then the next day came and he wasn't back.
*  That morning, that evening.
*  And I'm like, what the heck?
*  She knows that I'm leaving.
*  So I went over to her house.
*  Now, I hadn't been to her house in several years, but
*  I knew where she lived.
*  And I went to the house and the house was empty.
*  The house is up for sale.
*  I asked Denise about the house, a detail that didn't make sense to me.
*  And she explained that her parents had moved before Shane was born to
*  a house in Portland where Stanley had never been.
*  Naturally, I wanted to know what Stanley did when he saw the empty house.
*  He said that he called Denise and that she said she told her mother that
*  Stanley was taking Shane to Arizona for a funeral.
*  But that she had not told her mother to take Shane.
*  Stanley was in touch with Denise for a week by phone, but
*  nothing became clearer to him about where Shane was.
*  Only that Denise said he must be with them.
*  And then, along with the grandparents and Shane, she disappeared.
*  Here's the part of the story that no one can clarify, but
*  it seems that the essential sadness and horror is this.
*  Denise's parents convinced her that they could give Shane a better life, and
*  absolutely a better life than he would have with Stanley.
*  At some point, Denise agreed that her parents could take him to Texas,
*  where Maury had a new job, and that once she got herself together,
*  she would come get Shane.
*  Precisely when they moved and
*  precisely what degree of involvement Denise had in that move,
*  it's clear that she didn't tell Stanley what was happening.
*  I don't know what I was thinking, Denise told me, clearly in tears,
*  on several calls.
*  I was so young, I was not ready to be a mom, and
*  I will regret that for the rest of my life.
*  Denise did try to take custody of Shane a year after her mother and
*  stepfather moved to Texas.
*  When she went down, Maury threatened her.
*  Well, if you try to take Shane, Denise told me, Maury said,
*  we'll take him to Mexico, and you'll never see him again.
*  Denise believed him.
*  I was just scared to death, she said, but
*  I have no idea why I didn't just take him.
*  I asked Stanley what he did to try to find Shane.
*  You know, at that particular time, back in the 80s,
*  I'm in Salem, Oregon, which is basically white, under 2% black.
*  I was black, and his name was Baker, Stanley continued.
*  The stuff I had been through with police in my life, I didn't trust police.
*  Stanley said he did speak with one white officer he knew,
*  who said that without his son having his name,
*  there wasn't going to be any chance of getting him back.
*  It felt like a stupid question, but
*  I asked Stanley how he felt after Shane disappeared.
*  Shane was my world, Stanley said.
*  I was raised in church to believe that everybody had good in them.
*  When I lost Shane, I totally turned to God.
*  I'm like, I've evidently been messing up in my life, and I'm being punished.
*  I became a deacon in the church and would pray on my knees and
*  ask for my kid to show up and for me to be able to find him.
*  When Shane would have been about eight or nine, Stanley's sister,
*  Carol, ran into Denise in Salem, and Denise went over to their mother's house to talk.
*  I'm like, where's Shane?
*  And she was like, well, he's at my parents.
*  And I'm like, look, I agreed that your dad could use his name because he didn't
*  have anybody carrying on his name, and I'm trying to be a good person.
*  But now you guys have taken my kid and disappeared.
*  I want Shane in my name now, and I want him.
*  Stanley paused.
*  So Denise is like, okay, well, yeah, we can put him in the McCray name.
*  She gave me a phone number for Shane, but it was a wrong number.
*  And that was the last time I heard from Denise.
*  Some eight years after that, 13 years after his abduction,
*  Shane found his way back to his father.
*  One day, Stanley recalled, he had been at work, and
*  I was with my now wife of more than 30 years, Candice.
*  And I got to my door, and I was like, weird.
*  And she's like, what?
*  I'm like, I feel Shane.
*  His scent seems to be around me.
*  I haven't had that since he was three years old.
*  Everybody that I know, Stanley said, I'd always told about Shane.
*  I mean, he's my first kid.
*  We did everything together.
*  We'd be riding down the road, and he'd go, that's a 56 Chevy at three years old.
*  That's a 57 Chevy.
*  I'm like, man, look at my smart kid.
*  I was just so proud of him, watching the way that he grew.
*  And then they just ripped him out of my life.
*  A couple of weeks after he sensed Shane, Stanley told me.
*  My wife called me and said, hey, guess what?
*  Shane called.
*  I'm like, what?
*  McCray had gotten his father's name from his grandmother a few years earlier, and
*  at a certain point, reached a moment in his life when he sought that name in
*  a phone book and dialed the number next to it.
*  So he made an appointment to pick him up.
*  And when I got to him, I'm like, dude.
*  I told Candice, I got your scent.
*  It seemed like you had been at my door.
*  Some years later, McCray changed his last name to match his father's.
*  Some people go through the worst in life, and it destroys them.
*  Others, no less beset, see it move through them.
*  Some people think that I am troublingly optimistic,
*  McCray told me back in his office.
*  I don't know if that's true, but it's rather more that I tend to believe,
*  for reasons I can't fully explain, the good.
*  Or at least the least complicated version that would fall on the side of good.
*  It seems to me that McCray's optimism might be called faith.
*  I got this tattoo when I was in law school, McCray said.
*  Rolling his left forearm over to reveal a large black Latin cross.
*  When I did my very first reading for my first chap book, One Neither One,
*  from 2009, it's covered a sketch of shackles that can look like a pair of eyes
*  staring at the reader.
*  I made sure to wear a jacket so nobody would see it, because I was afraid.
*  Growing up, McCray continued, there was this kind of feeling that if you had
*  a Christian belief, you can't believe in God and be smart.
*  That was the feeling I got in the circles I ran in, and I felt really weird about it,
*  really insecure, because I did believe, McCray laughed.
*  So when I was first trying to be a poet, I didn't want anybody to know I was
*  a Christian, it was a source of worry for a pretty long time.
*  I'm also really ashamed of how, at least the Christians that get attention in
*  America, how a lot of them act.
*  It fills me with dismay, and I didn't want to be associated with that.
*  McCray told me how, at 19, he'd asked God to give him a sign.
*  If God did, McCray would believe in him.
*  The next day, McCray went up to the Mount Angel Monastery, a half hour out of Salem,
*  and there was a storm, thunder, and lightning.
*  And when he was getting ready to leave, the road out was blocked by two fallen
*  trees.
*  McCray says he didn't feel that God would waste his time knocking down trees so
*  a kid would believe.
*  But he had asked for a sign, and there one was.
*  McCray tried Islam, Taoism, but eventually came around to Christianity.
*  He was baptized a Christian at 29 while at Harvard Law School.
*  He had also been taking classes at the Episcopal Divinity School, had imagined,
*  still imagines, another path for himself as a priest.
*  But after a term, he learned he wasn't eligible to take more.
*  And yet, since then, the two things, belief in art and
*  faith in God, have come together.
*  Fractured through McCray's work, then, is what could be read as a very long poem
*  that has appeared in parts through four books.
*  There's a Purgatory, a Heaven, and a Hell.
*  McCray is long done with Purgatory and Heaven, but the Hell poem,
*  which first appeared in 2019, keeps getting bigger.
*  A few weeks before I wrote this article, he sent me the whole poem, or rather,
*  all of it minus two sections he has yet to write.
*  It's harrowing and strange and also extremely funny in moments.
*  It completes what I can't help seeing as the kind of
*  commedia written by someone who believes equally in the word and the word.
*  I asked McCray about the process by which he came to understand that Christ was
*  God's son and how the pain that God allowed to be brought upon Jesus,
*  the wounds inflicted on his body, ended up making sense to him.
*  In that context, I asked him why we suffer.
*  It's actually a question that I don't think about all that much, he said,
*  which feels terrible because I'm so
*  often on the verge of tears thinking about the suffering of others.
*  He paused.
*  It's God's universe.
*  God can do what God wants, which is kind of what St. Augustine said.
*  God doesn't owe us happy lives.
*  Throughout June and into July, I ended up going back and
*  forth between McCray's parents many times,
*  trying to reconcile their individual versions of events.
*  One day I got a text from Stanley.
*  Denise contacted me on Facebook a couple hours ago.
*  We ended up talking on the phone, and she remembers a lot, but
*  just like me, she's forgot a lot.
*  She does remember how upset she was when her mother lied to me and
*  came and got Shane.
*  I believe she was really hurt regarding that whole situation, and
*  she seems to be struggling with how everything went down.
*  I called Denise to ask her about the conversation with Stanley.
*  It's really painful for me what Shane went through, and
*  I feel extremely at fault, and it's something that I'll probably deal with forever.
*  But I wanted to help change part of that.
*  So I looked up Oregon laws to see if Stanley could get on his birth certificate
*  even now, and it sounds like he could.
*  So I reached out to Stanley.
*  As Stanley understood it, the only thing he had agreed to 47 years earlier
*  was that his son would have the Baker name.
*  He had not known that the birth certificate would make no mention of him as
*  the father, but now he had seen the evidence for himself.
*  I asked if I could see it.
*  He texted it along.
*  The certificate of live birth shows that on September 22nd, 1975,
*  a child in box one, Shane Allen Baker,
*  was born at 6.59 PM to mother in box 6A, Denise Allen Baker.
*  Box 8A for father is blank.
*  It is as if no such person existed.
*  Though McCray says he was kidnapped from his father when he was three,
*  he is in a way wrong.
*  It took place on the day he was born.
*  I'm glad that's happening,
*  McCray said of adding Stanley's name to his birth certificate.
*  Me changing my name to his last name when I was in my very early 20s was really
*  important, and that was very meaningful to me.
*  The public acknowledgement of him as my father had felt as if I was doing some
*  small thing to right or wrong.
*  It was emotional.
*  I felt driven to do it.
*  So whatever emotions would go with it were emotions that I already felt decades ago.
*  On the 1st of July, Stanley and his wife,
*  each on their separate Harley-Davidson's, began the 21 hour ride from San Diego to
*  Oregon.
*  Stanley wanted to take the forms in himself.
*  Too much for too long had gone wrong.
*  He wasn't about to let anything happen now.
*  If in life, McCray has met this advent with what might seem like a mildness of
*  feeling.
*  In art, he has shown a fierce commitment to inventing forms that express
*  significant emotion.
*  The title of McCray's memoir, Pulling the Chariot of the Sun,
*  alludes to the Greek myth of a son seeking his father,
*  Phaeton, a mortal boy, Helios, a god.
*  Phaeton had been told that his father was a god, but had never met him.
*  So he went on a journey to find them, did, and asked that the god give him proof of
*  his patrimony.
*  The god said, anything you ask of me, I will grant.
*  The boy asked to drive the chariot of the sun,
*  the one that Helios drove each day to make the sun rise,
*  pulled by four horses of enormous power.
*  The god knew that the boy was no match for the task, and
*  yet he had given himself no choice but to say yes.
*  So Phaeton took the reins at dawn, rose, and of course fell,
*  literally dying to learn that his father's name was his own.
*  McCray's version of the story inverts that myth.
*  At his memoir's end, he finds his father, learns his name, and
*  lives.
