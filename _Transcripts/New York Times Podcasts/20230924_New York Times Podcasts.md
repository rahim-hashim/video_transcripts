*  My name is Wyatt Mason and I'm a contributing writer for the New York Times magazine.
*  This week's Sunday read is my recent article for the magazine about the 48-year-old American
*  poet Shane McCray.
*  Since 2009, McCray has published 13 collections of verse, some 800 pages of supremely accomplished
*  work.
*  He writes deeply about race, about marriage, and about sin and pergation.
*  Through it all, he's been exploring the complexities of his biography, an exploration which prompts
*  this latest piece of mind on the occasion of his just published memoir, pulling the
*  chariot of the sun.
*  McCray explores the extraordinary events of his childhood when he was kidnapped at age
*  three from his black father by his white maternal grandparents.
*  They took him from Salem, Oregon, to just outside of Austin, Texas, raising him under the
*  premise that his father had abandoned him before he was born.
*  They also tried to keep McCray's racial identity from him, raising this black kid with the
*  understanding that he was a white kid who just tan easily.
*  He was brought up in this brutal racist household by a grandfather who beat him and lied
*  to him and by a grandmother who, as much as she showed him love, was also a wildly
*  manipulative influence, brutal, in her own way.
*  McCray's personal history was a nightmare from which he doubted he could awake.
*  McCray's memoir is a very complicated piece of prose.
*  Some episodes are told many times, attempts by McCray to understand what might have happened.
*  My story for the magazine explores all of that, but it also goes to another place that
*  was unexpected for me as a writer.
*  There was a different burden on my part from when I write about novelists.
*  I needed, in a basic way, to fact-check the story, not out of a sense of suspicion so
*  much as due diligence.
*  I needed to speak with any of the people who were implicated in or involved with his kidnapping.
*  Needless to say, the first people I thought of were the grandparents, but they were dead.
*  So I asked McCray how he would feel if I were to reach out to his parents, both of whom
*  are alive, neither of whom had really spoken to the other in a quarter of a century.
*  McCray expressed some hesitation, but ultimately he said yes.
*  I ended up speaking with each of his parents many times over the course of a month, attempting
*  to reconcile differing accounts by McCray's mother, Denise, and his father, Stanley, of
*  events that happened more than 40 years ago.
*  McCray's memoir works towards a moment laid in the book of extraordinary synchronicity,
*  when as a teenager he realized that poetry was going to be the thing he would spend
*  his life doing.
*  It's a thrilling sequence of events, movingly told that I won't spoil here.
*  But what's particularly amazing is McCray's clear-sightedness, even as a teen, about what
*  it was going to take for him to learn what a poet can do.
*  He recognized that he was going to need to read compulsively, exhaustively.
*  And so one of the things that distinguishes McCray is how clearly his artistry is a hard
*  one consequence, not of his biography, but of his work ethic.
*  Beginning when he was a teenager, he kept to a rigorous course of auto-didacticism, reading
*  eight books at a time, 25 pages from each, 200 pages a day.
*  He needed to take all that in, he understood, if he was going to be able to write his way
*  to where he wanted to go.
*  In reporting this story, I learned once again that a great artist isn't somebody who sits
*  there waiting for inspiration to happen.
*  Rather, they find a way, their own way, to work tirelessly.
*  McCray's path to poetry is unique, however, and his memoir charts his movement through
*  the years of despair and drift that began when he was kidnapped from his father.
*  Taken, essentially, because his white grandparents didn't want him to be raised by a black man,
*  as a black man.
*  To survive all that and to thrive after it, what would it take and where as a poet would
*  it take him?
*  So here's my article, The Kidnapped Child Who Became a Poet, read by Prentice Ona Yemmi.
*  The weird thing about growing up kidnapped, Shane McCray, the 47-year-old American poet,
*  told me in his melodious, reedy voice one rainy afternoon in May, is if it happens early
*  enough, there's a way in which you kind of don't know.
*  There was no reason for McCray to have known.
*  What unfolded in McCray's childhood, between a June day in 1979, when his white grandmother
*  took him from his black father and disappeared.
*  And another day, 13 years later, when McCray opened a phone book in Salem, Oregon, found
*  a name he hoped was his father's in place to call.
*  Is both an unambiguous story of abduction and a convoluted story of complicity.
*  It loops through the American landscape, from Oregon to Texas to California to Oregon
*  again, and even now, when through the vast emotional country of a child and his parents.
*  And because so much of what happened to McCray happened in homes where he was beaten and
*  lied to and threatened, where he was made to understand that black people were inferior
*  to whites, where he was taught to hail Hitler, where he was told that his dark skin meant
*  he tanned easily, but no, not that he was black.
*  It's a story that's been hard from McCray to piece together.
*  My grandparents, McCray explained in a somewhat gloomy book-laden office at Columbia University,
*  where he teaches poetry in its MFA program.
*  They were so actively keeping my father away from me, they didn't want me to investigate
*  him at all.
*  It was just normal.
*  Normal McCray explained, because the story he had been told by his grandparents was that
*  McCray's father, whose name he didn't even know, abandoned him before he was born.
*  They had been doing it my whole life, McCray said matter effectively.
*  I didn't think of it as, oh, this is pretty strange.
*  McCray paused.
*  The after-effects of all that, he continued, it took me until to really understand that
*  I had been a kid-napped child.
*  Probably my early 40s when it finally started to make sense, and I really got it, and
*  I was like, oh, this is a big deal.
*  I had used the phrase before, growing up kid-napped, but somehow used it without it really sinking
*  in.
*  It was a thing that I was aware of as, this is technically true, but without really understanding
*  what that means.
*  McCray's new book, The Memoir, Pulling the Chariot of the Sun, it is being released
*  on August 1st.
*  It's his attempt to construct at a remove of four decades, an understanding of what happened,
*  and what it has come to mean.
*  The memoir takes the reader through McCray's childhood, from his earliest memories after
*  being taken from his father, to when, at 16, he found him again.
*  Like many accomplished memoirs that have followed from St. Augustine's pioneering confessions,
*  McCray's explores memories on certain contours, but like few memoirs before it, pulling
*  the chariot of the sun offers the experience in prose of that uncertainty.
*  It's essentially a 250 page avant-garde prose poem that has more in common with Virginia
*  Wolves' excellent, difficult novel, The Waves, then with Fasou's excellent, not difficult
*  memoir, stay true, or any memoir you might name.
*  McCray's sentences are constantly stating and retracting, moving forward and retreating,
*  establishing a perimeter around an event while trying to penetrate it, to enter the chalk
*  outline drawn around a body long buried, that of the boy McCray was before he was taken.
*  At first, the mode can be off-putting.
*  Decisions and revisions that a minute can reverse, the reader left to wonder why the same story,
*  McCray's birth, say, as it was reported to him, is told multiple times.
*  But it's not long before the initial aesthetic perplexity resolves for the reader into the
*  recognition that this is how a mind works with the best.
*  Eternal return, compulsive attempts to make something hold over which you have no control.
*  And then the reader begins to welcome, need, in fact, McCray's multiplicities, that's
*  straining for resolution.
*  The memoir accumulates a hugeness of feeling that puts a lie to the idea that difficulty
*  and a piece of writing is necessarily cold or aloof, or incompatible with the kind of
*  intense emotion that McCray's narrative uncommonly yields.
*  Until I was 13, I slept with the light on.
*  McCray writes midway through the memoir.
*  The main light in my bedroom, the light in the ceiling, sometimes still wearing the clothes
*  I had worn that day, sometimes even wearing my shoes.
*  Most of my childhood, I felt I had to be prepared to be taken from my life at any moment.
*  Knowing the chariot of the sun is the story of an undoing, but it is no less a story
*  of becoming.
*  McCray takes the reader to the house where he was made to live with his grandparents, documents
*  how he was thrown at age three, into a wall by his grandfather, because he was crying for
*  his father.
*  How he was knocked unconscious.
*  How the beatings continued as McCray matured.
*  Until his grandmother divorced the grandfather when McCray was 14.
*  There are visits from his mother and his brief failed period living with her as a teenager.
*  Time at multiple schools, three and ninth grade alone, where he sat at the backs of rooms,
*  a middling student, largely friendless.
*  But there is also the freedom and pleasure he experienced skateboarding, at which he excelled
*  enough to be able to see vividly the fine line that separated his skills from those of
*  skaters who became pros.
*  And there is McCray's revelation as a tenth grader who would go on to repeat the year,
*  that a standardized test put his writing at an eighth grade level, the metrics of the
*  world reporting that he was contrary to his sense of himself, stupid.
*  Seated within that plausible sadness and loneliness and horror and hopelessness, is the
*  story of the strange concatenation of events that produced the moment when McCray found
*  his path to poetry.
*  He was a poet as anchor to life and then as avenue to himself.
*  His memoir is therefore, and perhaps most memorably, a building's roman, a portrait of a poet
*  as a young black man, a boy raised in a particular crucible of capture that as part of its power
*  enacts the American story of seizure and captivity of black people by white tormentors.
*  McCray dropped out of high school and got an equivalency diploma.
*  By 19 he was on his own, married, father of a daughter, but without a clear path forward,
*  only a clear ambition to write poetry.
*  Through that period he kept to a strict regimen of reading 200 pages a day.
*  Eight books at once in rotation, 25 pages from each, absorbing writing from every era,
*  understanding that beyond his need to make it, he knew nothing about poetry.
*  What he did know, having been an excellent skateboarder, was that if you wanted to land
*  a reverse ollie, you needed your 10,000 hours to get there.
*  He entered community college at 21.
*  After transferring twice, he graduated from a good local college, Linfield, at 26, with
*  an acceptance letter from the premier MFA program in the world, the Iowa writers' workshop.
*  Graduating in 2004, he went straight to Harvard Law School to get a JD, thinking that he
*  would briefly support himself as a lawyer.
*  The Kray didn't like law school, but completed it.
*  And as he was doing so, because he could take courses elsewhere at the university, he applied
*  for a place in the poetry workshop of a poet he had been reading for years, Jory Graham.
*  It seemed at the start that he didn't know if he should be there, if he wanted to be
*  there.
*  Graham wrote to me.
*  But as we say, he had an ear.
*  He wrote a slightly conventional poem, and his heart was tight, and his natural voice was
*  through clenched teeth.
*  I felt anger on his page, repressed anger.
*  I felt he had been beaten down by some great force, some injustice beyond the injustice
*  of being black in America, but I could not break through to it.
*  At some point, he came to me in my office with a strange draft where a few lines broke
*  apart at what would have been Phrasodical Cisuras.
*  And as we spoke, he shared a great personal grief and burden.
*  And I remember this vividly.
*  I looked back and forth from his broad, open, suddenly vulnerable face, through the lines
*  broken open by a kind of stuttering breath or a breath taken to squelch a sob.
*  And I thought, here it is.
*  Here we go.
*  His ear is released.
*  The next week, he had a handful of poems in that form.
*  The form worked because it correlated to the griefs he was undergoing.
*  Since 2009, Macray has published 13 books of poetry, hundreds of pages of supremely
*  accomplished verse.
*  He has written autobiographically on the dissolution of marriage and the challenges
*  of fatherhood, on the reality of racism as he has encountered it, and as American history
*  has fostered it, and on sin and its pergation and transcendence, not in some abstract
*  mode, but from a decidedly Christian perspective.
*  Macray is a practicing Episcopalian.
*  But these are just themes.
*  Every poet has them, and they say nothing about what might make verse notable, durable.
*  It is Macray's own deep knowledge and use of the history of poetic form that has marked
*  his work and made it identifiably his own.
*  Macray has written scores of sonnets with the forms standard seventy beats and its characteristic
*  meter of I amic pentameter.
*  And yet a reader encountering these poems for the first time on the page where they do
*  not look like sonnets.
*  The lines are ruptured, gaped, slashed, broken at the wrong places.
*  Would be hard pressed to see a sonnets' shape hiding there in plain sight.
*  But as you not so much push through them as are pulled along by the currents in them,
*  a freight of feeling accumulates, and by the end of his best poems detonates in final
*  lines that are often so aggressively felt that you hardly notice the rigor of the meter
*  that has gotten you there.
*  I tend to think that poems, Macray told me, they're smarter than the people who write
*  them, and they're smarter than the people that read them.
*  A poem that is successful is a poem that you can never entirely possess.
*  It will always resist you through its sort of fathomless difficulty, that there's always
*  going to be some new thing with the poem, because you haven't gotten the whole thing.
*  Many of Macray's poems have addressed the pain in his own biography.
*  The first poem, the cardinal, is the marriage bird, and his first major book, Mule, ends
*  with the word, Wound.
*  A suite of poems follows in which Macray takes on the role of the book's title animal,
*  the white, white, white, poem set in the Texas to which he was taken, among them three
*  different poems all called, Molado.
*  A word the Spanish root of which means, young Mule, capturing a boy's awareness of the
*  rupture at the center of his nature, or, niggers on TV, a harrowing but also strangely tender
*  poem that captures the effects of his grandfather's racism.
*  On a little boy who liked to dance along with the Huxtebles when the Cosby Show came on,
*  with his grandmother, I only ever saw her dance with me, which, not at all, incidentally,
*  dances along in Iambic pentameter, a complicated act of love nesting within the horror.
*  Over the years, Macray has burrowed into the ugliness of how whites have treated blacks,
*  imagining the voices of historical figures like Jim Limber, a mixed race orphan adopted
*  by the family of Jefferson Davis at the end of his time as president of the Confederacy,
*  irreconcilable depictions of violence and love.
*  All the while, Macray has nudged closer to exploring the grotesqueery of his own treatment.
*  Earlier poems using the word taken before the newer poems incorporated, finally, the word
*  that Macray knows to be true.
*  Kidnapped.
*  I wondered why Macray felt he needed now to approach this history, already glimpsed in
*  his mature work, through narrative.
*  Up until that point, Macray told me, I wrote stuff that I figured one would write.
*  Being as how I was kidnapped, what is the sort of thing a person who was kidnapped would
*  say?
*  In a lot of my poems, that's the way I was thinking about it.
*  But it wasn't until I wrote the memoir that I started to understand that it wasn't like
*  being kidnapped was someone running up to you every day and shouting, A, your kidnapped,
*  which is what the moment of the poem kind of feels like, a dramatization.
*  Being kidnapped is just, you're living your life and no one is telling you what the premise
*  is.
*  I used to think that there was something wrong with my emotional life, Macray told me later,
*  because I had difficulty conjuring up feelings about like when my grandmother died from complications
*  of Alzheimer's while he was in law school.
*  I was like, OK, well, here's something I'm supposed to feel and I couldn't.
*  I was aware that being taken from my father when I was and my subsequent experiences really
*  broke something in my ability to connect with family that is generationally before me.
*  And I feel is the absence of feeling things that I should.
*  As I sought to fill in Macray's early years, I felt I needed to speak with his mother
*  and father.
*  He expressed some hesitation, however, and before he ultimately said it would be fine
*  with him and with them, if I did, I spoke with one of Macray's high school teachers who
*  shifted those conversations in an unexpected direction.
*  The day after we spoke, she texted yearbook photos from when Macray would have been in
*  ninth and tenth grade.
*  There he was.
*  In two adolescent shots a year apart, his name was listed not as Macray, but as Baker.
*  Oh, yes, that's right.
*  Denise Baker, Macray's mom, told me on the phone from her home in Portland, Oregon.
*  Baker was Shane's last name.
*  Baker was the name of her stepfather, Morris, whom everyone called Mori and whom Denise
*  called during our conversations, the monster.
*  He was her mother's fifth and final husband.
*  They married when Denise was five.
*  Denise says that when she was still small, he kicked her down a hallway so hard that it
*  felt as if he broke her tailbone.
*  When she became a teenager, they fought outright.
*  He was a racist and she had black friends.
*  Things got bad.
*  Her mom and Mori called her fat, worthless, stupid.
*  She repeatedly ran away.
*  When she was around 14, her parents told the state that she was out of control and she
*  was remanded to juvenile detention for a year.
*  After she got out, she was emancipated from her parents.
*  They didn't want to have to take care of me anymore.
*  Denise told me.
*  Denise talked about meeting Macray's father, Stanley, about which Macray writes in the
*  memoir, how his eventual father approached her slowly from an impossible distance, somehow
*  both in and beyond the came art.
*  Dressed, she would say, like super fly.
*  She would have been 15.
*  He was most likely 17 or 18.
*  She never told me what he ordered.
*  She never told me what they talked about.
*  As to why three years later, Shane was born a baker and not a Macray, as Denise tells
*  it.
*  A hospital staff member said that because she and Stanley weren't married, he wouldn't
*  be able to put his name on the form.
*  If he wanted to claim paternity, he could within six months if he filed a formal application.
*  Soon after she was released from the hospital, she and Shane joined Stanley and say them.
*  We hung out and talked.
*  Stanley told me from his home in San Diego.
*  I'm like, when do I need to sign the birth certificate?
*  And she was like, well, actually, I wanted to talk to you about that because my dad,
*  Larry, can't have kids.
*  And he was saying that if you let him put Shane in the baker name, when he passes, everything
*  he has will go to Shane.
*  And I'm like, really?
*  Because I'm not a rich man.
*  She said, yes.
*  And I'm like, okay, he can be in the baker name.
*  When he gets older, if he wants to change it, he can change it.
*  So this is to me where the story began.
*  All of a sudden, he's in the baker name.
*  It wasn't long after the birth that Denise and Stanley were no longer in a romantic relationship.
*  Shane was initially with Denise in Portland.
*  Sometimes she stayed with her parents who were living there.
*  By the time McCray was nearing three, Denise began to feel overwhelmed by the responsibility
*  of being a parent, afraid that she was going to be abusive to Shane the way her parents
*  had bent her.
*  Not long after, Stanley took Shane to Salem to live with him.
*  In June 2nd, 1979, Stanley's grandfather died.
*  He told Denise he wanted to take Shane to the funeral in Arizona.
*  Denise said that was fine.
*  Probably that same day, Stanley recalled, the grandmother came over.
*  I had bought Shane this little tricycle and he just loved it.
*  We were outside playing.
*  He's riding on the tricycle.
*  The grandmother pulls up and says, I'd like to see him before he leaves.
*  I'm like, yeah, absolutely.
*  I'm not leaving for a couple of days and she says, well, can he spend the night?
*  I'm like, no problem, no problem.
*  And she's like, I'll bring him back tomorrow.
*  I thought nothing at all.
*  But then the next day came and he wasn't back.
*  That morning, that evening.
*  And I'm like, what the heck?
*  She knows that I'm leaving.
*  So I went over to her house.
*  Now I hadn't been to her house in several years, but I knew where she lived.
*  I went to the house and the house was empty.
*  The house is up for sale.
*  I asked Denise about the house, a detail that didn't make sense to me.
*  And she explained that her parents had moved before Shane was born to a house in Portland
*  where Stanley had never been.
*  Naturally, I wanted to know what Stanley did when he saw the empty house.
*  He said that he called Denise and that she said she told her mother that Stanley was
*  taking Shane to Arizona for a funeral, but that she had not told her mother to take Shane.
*  Stanley was in touch with Denise for a week by phone, but nothing became clear to him
*  about where Shane was.
*  Only that Denise said he must be with them.
*  And then, along with the grandparents in Shane, she disappeared.
*  Here's the part of the story that no one can clarify, but it seems that the essential
*  sadness and horror is this.
*  Denise's parents convinced her that they could give Shane a better life and absolutely
*  a better life than he would have with Stanley.
*  At some point, Denise agreed that her parents could take him to Texas where Mori had a new
*  job and that once she got herself together, she would come get Shane.
*  Precisely when they moved and precisely what degree of involvement Denise had in that
*  move, it's clear that she didn't tell Stanley what was happening.
*  I don't know what I was thinking.
*  Denise told me clearly in tears on several calls.
*  I was so young, I was not ready to be a mom and I will regret that for the rest of my
*  life.
*  Denise did try to take custody of Shane a year after her mother and stepfather moved to
*  Texas.
*  When she went down, Mori threatened her.
*  Well, if you try to take Shane, Denise told me Mori said, we'll take him to Mexico and
*  you'll never see him again.
*  Denise believed him.
*  I was just scared to death, she said, but I have no idea why I didn't just take him.
*  I asked Stanley what he did to try to find Shane.
*  You know, at that particular time, back in the 80s, I'm in Salem, Oregon, which is basically
*  white, under 2% black.
*  I was black and his name was Baker.
*  Stanley continued.
*  The stuff I had been through with police in my life, I didn't trust police.
*  Stanley said he did speak with one white officer he knew who said that without his son having
*  his name, there wasn't going to be any chance of getting him back.
*  It felt like a stupid question, but I asked Stanley how he felt after Shane disappeared.
*  Shane was my world.
*  Stanley said.
*  I was raised in church to believe that everybody had good in them.
*  When I lost Shane, I totally turned to God.
*  I'm like, I've evidently been messing up in my life and I'm being punished.
*  I became a deacon in the church and would pray on my knees and ask for my kid to show
*  up and for me to be able to find him.
*  When Shane would have been about 8 or 9, Stanley's sister Carol ran into Denise in Salem
*  and Denise went over to their mother's house to talk.
*  I'm like, where's Shane?
*  And she was like, well, he's at my parents and I'm like, look, I agreed that your dad
*  could use his name because he didn't have anybody carrying on his name.
*  I'm trying to be a good person, but now you guys have taken my kid and disappeared.
*  I want Shane in my name now and I want him.
*  Stanley paused.
*  So Denise is like, okay, well, yeah, we can put him in the McCray name.
*  She gave me a phone number for Shane, but it was a wrong number and that was the last
*  time I heard from Denise.
*  Some 8 years after that, 13 years after his abduction, Shane found his way back to his
*  father.
*  One day Stanley recalled he had been at work and I was with my now wife of more than 30
*  years, Candace.
*  And I got to my door and I was like, weird.
*  And she's like, what?
*  I'm like, I feel Shane.
*  His scent seems to be around me.
*  I haven't had that since he was three years old.
*  Everybody that I know, Stanley said, I'd always told about Shane.
*  I mean, he's my first kid.
*  We did everything together.
*  We'd be riding down the road and he'd go, that's a 56 Chevy at three years old.
*  That's a 57 Chevy.
*  I'm like, man, look at my smart kid.
*  I was just so proud of him, watching the way that he grew and then they just ripped him
*  out of my life.
*  A couple of weeks after he sensed Shane, Stanley told me, my wife called me and said, hey,
*  guess what?
*  Shane called.
*  I'm like, what?
*  McCray had gotten his father's name from his grandmother a few years earlier.
*  And at a certain point, reached a moment in his life when he sought that name in a phone
*  book and dialed the number next to it.
*  So he made an appointment to pick him up.
*  And when I got to him, I'm like, dude, I told Candace I got your scent.
*  It seems like you had been at my door.
*  Some years later, McCray changed his last name to match his father's.
*  Some people go through the worst in life and it destroys them.
*  Others, no less, but said, see it move through them.
*  Some people think that I am troublingly optimistic, McCray told me back in his office.
*  I don't know if that's true, but it's rather more that I tend to believe for reasons I can't
*  fully explain the good, or at least the least complicated version that would fall on the
*  side of good.
*  It seems to me that McCray's optimism might be called faith.
*  I got this tattoo when I was in law school.
*  McCray said, rolling his left forearm over to reveal a large black Latin cross.
*  When I did my very first reading, my first chat book, one neither one, from 2009, it's
*  cover a sketch of shackles that can look like a pair of eyes staring at the reader.
*  I made sure to wear a jacket so nobody would see it because I was afraid.
*  Growing up, McCray continued, there was this kind of feeling that if you had a Christian
*  belief, you can't believe in God and be smart.
*  That was the feeling I got in the circles I ran in, and I felt really weird about it,
*  really insecure because I did believe McCray laughed.
*  So when I was first trying to be a poet, I didn't want anybody to know I was a Christian.
*  It was a source of worry for a pretty long time.
*  I'm also really ashamed of how, at least the Christians that get attention in America,
*  how a lot of them act.
*  It feels me with this may, and I didn't want to be associated with that.
*  McCray told me how, at 19, he'd asked God to give him a sign.
*  If God did, McCray would believe in him.
*  The next day, McCray went up to the Mount Angel monastery, a half hour out of Salem,
*  and there was a storm, thunder and lightning.
*  And when he was getting ready to leave, the road out was blocked by two fallen trees.
*  McCray says he didn't feel that God would waste his time knocking down trees so a kid
*  would believe.
*  But he had asked for a sign, and there one was.
*  McCray tried Islam, Taoism, but eventually came around to Christianity.
*  He was baptized to Christian at 29 while at Harvard Law School.
*  He had also been taking classes at the Episcopal Divinity School.
*  Had imagined, still imagines, another path for himself as a priest.
*  After a term, he learned he wasn't eligible to take more.
*  And yet, since then, the two things, belief in art and faith in God, have come together.
*  Fractured through McCray's work, then, is what could be read as a very long poem that
*  has appeared in parts through four books.
*  There's a purgatory, a heaven, and a hell.
*  McCray is long done with purgatory and heaven, but the hell poem, which first appeared
*  in 2019, keeps getting bigger.
*  A few weeks before I wrote this article, he sent me the whole poem, or rather all of it
*  minus two sections he has yet to write.
*  It's harrowing and strange and also extremely funny in moments.
*  It completes what I can't help seeing as the kind of comedia, written by someone who
*  believes equally in the word and the word.
*  I asked McCray about the process by which he came to understand that Christ was God's
*  son and how the pain that God allowed to be brought upon Jesus, the wounds inflicted
*  on his body, ended up making sense to him.
*  In that context, I asked him why we suffer.
*  It's actually a question that I don't think about all that much, he said, which feels
*  terrible because I'm so often on the verge of tears thinking about the suffering of others.
*  He paused.
*  It's God's universe.
*  God can do what God wants, which is kind of what St. Augustine said.
*  God doesn't owe us happy lives.
*  Throughout June and into July, I ended up going back and forth between McCray's parents
*  many times, trying to reconcile their individual versions of events.
*  One day I got a text from Stanley.
*  The niece contacted me on Facebook a couple hours ago.
*  We ended up talking on the phone and she remembers a lot, but just like me, she's forgot
*  a lot.
*  She does remember how upset she was when her mother lied to me and came and got Shane.
*  I believe she was really hurt regarding that whole situation and she seems to be struggling
*  with how everything went down.
*  I called Denise to ask her about the conversation with Stanley.
*  It's really painful for me what Shane went through and I feel extremely at fault and it's
*  something that I'll probably deal with forever.
*  But I wanted to help change part of that.
*  So I looked up organ laws to see if Stanley could get on his birth certificate even now
*  and it sounds like he could.
*  So I reached out to Stanley.
*  As Stanley understood it, the only thing he had agreed to 47 years earlier was that his
*  son would have the baker name.
*  He had not known that the birth certificate would make no mention of him as the father.
*  But now he had seen the evidence for himself.
*  I asked if I could see it.
*  He texted it along.
*  The certificate of live birth shows that on September 22nd, 1975, a child in box one, Shane
*  Alan Baker was born at 6.59 pm to mother in box 6A.
*  Denise Alan Baker, box 8A for father is blank.
*  It is as if no such person existed.
*  The MacRase says he was kidnapped from his father when he was 3.
*  He is in a way wrong.
*  It took place on the day he was born.
*  I'm glad that's happening.
*  MacRase said of adding Stanley's name to his birth certificate.
*  Me changing my name to his last name when I was in my very early 20s was really important.
*  And that was very meaningful to me.
*  The public acknowledgement of him as my father had felt as if I was doing some small thing
*  to write a wrong.
*  It was emotional.
*  I felt driven to do it.
*  So whatever emotions would go with it were emotions that I already felt decades ago.
*  On the 1st of July, Stanley and his wife, each on their separate Harley-Davidson, began
*  the 21-hour ride from San Diego to Oregon.
*  Stanley wanted to take the forms and himself.
*  Too much for too long had gone wrong.
*  He wasn't about to let anything happen now.
*  If in life, MacRase has met this advent with what might seem like a mildness of feeling.
*  In art, he has shown a fierce commitment to inventing forms that express significant
*  emotion.
*  The title of MacRase memoir, pulling the chariot of the sun, alludes to the Greek myth
*  of a sun seeking his father.
*  Fiatten, a mortal boy, Helios, a god.
*  Fiatten had been told that his father was a god, but had never met him.
*  So he went on a journey to find them, did, and asked that the god give him proof of his
*  patrimony.
*  The god said, anything you ask of me, I will grant.
*  The boy asked to drive the chariot of the sun, the one that Helios drove each day to make
*  the sun rise, bold by four horses of enormous power.
*  The god knew that the boy was no match for the task, and yet he had given himself no
*  choice but to say yes.
*  So Fiatten took the reins at dawn, rose, and of course, fell.
*  Literally dying to learn that his father's name was his own.
*  MacRase version of the story inverts that myth.
*  His memoirs end, defines his father, learns his name, and lives.
