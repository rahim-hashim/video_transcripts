# Trump’s Voters vs. Haley’s Donors

*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Barrow.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Inside the Republican Party, a class war is playing out between the pro-Trump base,
*  who's ready for the nomination fight to be over, and the anti-Trump donor class, who
*  thinks it's just getting started.
*  Today, my colleague, Astead Herndon, a political correspondent and host of the run-up, reports
*  on that clash.
*  It's Tuesday, January 30th.
*  Hello.
*  Hello.
*  Hey, how are you?
*  Good.
*  Let me know when you're ready.
*  I'm ready.
*  Okay.
*  So, Astead, at this moment in the Republican presidential race, two kind of baffling things
*  are occurring at the same time.
*  This race is far from over.
*  There are dozens of states left to go.
*  The first is that former South Carolina governor, Nikki Haley, is behaving as if she really
*  has a shot at beating Donald Trump.
*  We still have a ways to go, but we keep moving up.
*  Which all evidence suggests is false.
*  And the second thing that's happening is that Donald Trump, and just a little note to Nikki,
*  she's not going to win, is fixated on attacking Nikki Haley and her campaign over and over.
*  And I said, wow, she's doing like a speech like she won.
*  She didn't win.
*  She lost.
*  And, you know, despite the fact that she has no real shot at beating him.
*  But let's not have somebody take a victory when she had a very bad night.
*  She had a very bad night.
*  You have been studying the Republican presidential race very closely over the past few months.
*  So my question for you is, why are both of these things happening?
*  And what do they tell us about this political moment in the Republican party?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think if you see it through the lens of just Donald Trump versus Nikki Haley and two candidates
*  that are vying to get the nomination, then you're right.
*  It is kind of baffling.
*  You know, Haley has always been a long shot to become the Republican nominee.
*  And that's even become more clear as voters in Iowa and New Hampshire.
*  And particularly, the Republican base has made it overwhelmingly obvious that their preference
*  is Donald Trump.
*  Indeed.
*  But I think if you view it through a different lens and specifically the kind of broader
*  coalitions that these two candidates represent and the donors that support these campaigns,
*  then I think you understand why they feel so diametrically opposed and why the slices
*  of the Republican party who are supporting them see themselves as diametrically opposed.
*  So what I mean by that is the more Nikki Haley stays in the race, the more it fuels the
*  distaste on the Trump Maga movement side, specifically because they see her as a candidate
*  who represents the interest of a elite donor class of a Republican wing that's more lenient
*  on issues of immigration.
*  That is more deferential to the foreign policy establishment and embrace kind of American
*  intervention and wars abroad.
*  And those are such fundamental beliefs when you think about the kind of Donald Trump wing
*  of the Republican party that they see someone like Haley as being offensive to the idea
*  that that's what the Republican party in 2024 represents.
*  And when I was at Donald Trump's victory party in Nashville, New Hampshire last week,
*  when we see the results rolling in that confirm another victory, it wasn't just that the supporters
*  in the building were mocking Nikki Haley and kind of gloating on the fact that they were
*  winning.
*  They were also mocking what they call the elite donor Republican class who they think is
*  funding Nikki Haley.
*  So when we were watching the results on the screen on Tuesday, I talked to a conservative
*  radio host named John Frederick, see someone who has aligned himself with Donald Trump and
*  really gives a good articulation of what the MAGA movement represents.
*  Listen, this is the greatest movement, the populist movement of the working people in the history
*  of the Republicans and these donors on Wall Street don't get it.
*  They don't understand the party has changed.
*  This is a working class party now.
*  White, black, Asian, Hispanic, it doesn't matter.
*  If you work for a living and you are punching a block, if you're not part of the elite,
*  you're getting screwed and they know it.
*  Your jobs are going away, your wages are eroding, your profit share is going down, your savings
*  is getting obliterated with inflation, you're getting wiped out, they don't care, illegal
*  is overrunning your country, they're taking your jobs, are shifting into China and the elites
*  and the donor class and the Wall Street gangster backstors who live for open borders and
*  cheap labor just think they can buy this stuff.
*  Those are the type of messages that the Donald Trump wing of the Republican Party is putting
*  out there about Nikki Haley kind of framing the efforts as a elite, undemocratic idea that
*  they can talk over what the working class Republican person wants and of course what they're
*  saying that working class Republican wants is Donald Trump.
*  But one of the things that he said that really sticks with me is that they see the MAGA movement
*  as something that is independent from any individual candidate.
*  The start movement right now Donald Trump is the conduit for that.
*  Post Trump, they'll be someone else because the public movement is on the verge tonight
*  of obliterating the establishment, uniparty elite and where weeks away from taking over
*  the whole Republican Party apparatus if not weeks a year.
*  And so in supporting Donald Trump, they're not only doing that because they want him to
*  be the individual candidate.
*  They're doing that because they see him as a conduit to be able to root out that slice
*  of the Republican Party, the kind of donor class that supports Haley, which they find
*  kind of detrimental to their overall interest.
*  Right.
*  They want to reclaim the Republican Party from rich donors and fully ensure that it's
*  in the hands of the MAGA movement, which then their minds is a working class movement,
*  and they've profoundly and inevitably at odds with a bunch of rich donors.
*  100%.
*  And not just at odds with rich donors, odds with party leadership, at odds with the kind
*  of Washington establishment, they feel that they are distinct from the kind of political
*  institutions and apparatus that keep people in defined lines that they want to bust out
*  up.
*  And so I think that's a little bit of a different way to view the different candidacies.
*  I think Nikki Haley has supporters, people who are voting for her because of her stances
*  on particular issues or because they're desired to see them as the nominee.
*  Donald Trump runs a group that thinks of themselves as a movement, as more than just supporting
*  a candidate, but is a vehicle to overtake the party itself.
*  But to the question of why she's still in the race when all the sides point to that movement
*  you're describing working and defeating her, what do you say?
*  I mean, candidates drop out of race is not because of their own volition, but mostly because
*  they run out of money and they run out of support and the path to making them president.
*  Right.
*  And so I think that it is critical to understanding, if you're asking why is Nikki Haley still
*  in this race, it's because there are enough Republican donors who are willing to continue
*  to support her to stay in this race.
*  And I think this is unique to this year, partially because some people don't want to see the
*  primary and so fast, partially because Donald Trump has legal issues hanging over his head.
*  And so there are some reasons in the air about like why that support has continued, but for
*  the kind of Trump wing of the party, what they are saying is that the existence of that support
*  is a kind of anti-timocratic perversion of the people's will.
*  Hmm.
*  So thinking back to my question about why is Haley staying in the race, why are Trump
*  and supporters kicking her around so hard?
*  The answers are kind of interrelated and they're very much tied to what you just laid out,
*  which is the sense that donors whose values and visions are very much at odds with the
*  MAGA movement, they're fueling the Haley movement beyond its expiration date according to Trump's
*  supporters.
*  And that is why Trump and his supporters are so mad at this campaign.
*  Exactly.
*  And I think it's important to not just view this in the vacuum of 2024, but this is the
*  entire premise of Donald Trump's candidacy and his ascension in the Republican party.
*  He came in as the quote unquote outsider, as the person who had his own individual money
*  and was therefore unreliant to big donors.
*  There is a sense among his supporters and a sense that he furthers in his own kind of
*  rhetoric that he is the only candidate that is untethered to the political institutions
*  that serve the elites.
*  And that is not only donors, but that is the political establishment in Washington,
*  right?
*  And so being at that event in Nashville, seeing the open vitriol, not only to the Haley
*  campaign, but to the Republican donors who are backing her, made me think about the
*  kind of broader question of the party's unity going forward.
*  So the next morning, after the results had come in, I decided to call a Haley donor,
*  a billionaire who was backing her to see how we saw the race going forward and how we
*  would respond to the argument that in giving so much money to a candidate who is such
*  a long shot, he is kind of seeking to upend the will of the voters.
*  After the break, a Steads conversation with that donor.
*  We'll be right back.
*  I'm doing well.
*  How are you?
*  Good.
*  Tim Draper is a venture capitalist who's invested in companies like Tesla, Skype, Hotmail,
*  Twitch and Robinhood.
*  I mean, can you tell me a little bit about yourself?
*  Can you tell me about like, how?
*  Tell me about your business career and how you made money in the first place.
*  Yeah.
*  So I started out as an entrepreneur.
*  Oh, let me go way back.
*  My grandfather was the first Silicon Valley venture capitalist.
*  My father was a venture capitalist.
*  I had venture capital in my blood.
*  It was it.
*  He's given more than a million dollars to Haley's campaign and the outside groups that are
*  backing her.
*  I guess I would start with just saying like, what caused you to back Nikki Haley and specifically
*  what caused you to donate your money to Nikki Haley?
*  Yeah.
*  I have been really impressed with her.
*  I think she has very good character.
*  I think she is kind.
*  She is very thoughtful.
*  She sees all points of view on things like pro choice versus pro life.
*  She understands foreign policy, which is I travel a lot.
*  I go all over the world.
*  And I've seen how important our foreign policy is and how we are represented internationally.
*  And I like her attitude of I support my friends.
*  I support democracies.
*  I don't support dictatorships.
*  When I first met her, I just thought, wow, this woman is strong and capable and she gets
*  things done.
*  When you see that she does it in an effective way, where everybody comes out feeling good.
*  And I think there's a strong character there and she's tough and she's willing to run
*  for president.
*  I mean, for somebody that amazing to be willing to run for president, I think we were just
*  lucky.
*  You know, one of the things that we've reported on through this show is how Nikki Haley
*  has a difficult path to when the Republican nomination partially because the ways the
*  party has changed in the Donald Trump era.
*  When you are giving to her, when you are backing her originally, I guess I'm wondering kind
*  of how were you thinking about her path to victory in the primary, considering Donald
*  Trump has changed a party to such a degree.
*  Yeah, it's funny.
*  I miscalculated on one thing.
*  And that was that I didn't realize that those Trump supporters just want retribution.
*  They're just angry and they want retribution and they stopped listening.
*  And I was thinking, oh my God, Trump Biden combination would be ridiculous.
*  Why we got so many great candidates out there.
*  Why would we ever want these two octogenarians to be, you know, are two candidates?
*  You thought everyone was kind of on the same page that you wouldn't want the same thing
*  again.
*  Right.
*  I didn't think anybody really wanted that.
*  But I think that there is so much animosity built up.
*  And I don't know which side is right here.
*  I don't have a really strong feeling about, you know, whether, you know, the people who
*  are saying he was wronged or the people who are saying he's a felon are right.
*  I don't know.
*  That'll come out in the courts or whatever.
*  But I did think, you know, he might have been a good candidate a year ago.
*  I'm not so sure that makes any sense today.
*  But his supporters are just so much after retribution that I think they stopped listening.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, that's kind of where I wanted to go.
*  I mean, obviously there were high hopes for Nikki Haley in New Hampshire specifically because
*  it has so much more of the independent votes, the moderate kind of Republican voter.
*  I think about the results last night as I'm sure you watched.
*  Would you say like, isn't 11 point lost there in the example of her gaining traction?
*  Or should we take the results from Iowa and New Hampshire as evidence that the majority
*  of the Republican base is squarely behind Donald Trump?
*  No.
*  I think, you know, she had 2% of the vote when I started backing her and she is now at 43%
*  of the vote.
*  She had 20% in Iowa.
*  The trend is good.
*  He still pulls better than she does.
*  I think that that is changing and now is the time to support her.
*  So she gets into the general election.
*  So what I hear, you're saying the trend line is such that you still feel good about that
*  investment in the Haley campaign.
*  And will you get more money going forward?
*  Should she stay in this race?
*  I know that's an open question that some people are trying to pressure her to get out.
*  What's your message to that?
*  No, no.
*  A lot happens in politics and she's down to just the two of them.
*  She should definitely stay in.
*  A lot can happen through, you know, South Carolina, Super Tuesday.
*  So no, I think she should go, go, go.
*  I'm very happy with the investment I made and I wrote a song for her.
*  I mean, I was going to go to the song next.
*  So I'm glad you brought this up because I recently heard the song.
*  It's a real earworm.
*  I listened to it yesterday and I have to say I did wake up today with, you know, we
*  need to niki right now.
*  It's just talking about.
*  I was going to ask, can I hear some of the rap?
*  Can you drop a little for us right now?
*  No, I'm not sure I can because I don't, I don't have it all in my, I know it sticks
*  in your ear.
*  We need you, Niki.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  To lead our nation.
*  We need you.
*  There we go.
*  Thank you.
*  So.
*  We need the conversation.
*  We need.
*  We need to niki right now.
*  To lead our nation.
*  We need you, Niki.
*  No doubt.
*  We need you.
*  We need you.
*  And then it's, oh, I can tell you this part of the rap.
*  It's, uh-huh.
*  I mean, that's a different level of dedication to a candidate than we typically see, right?
*  I guess I'm asking like, considering the high road she has declined to become Denominee,
*  what made you say this moment right now is all in?
*  Is that the candidate or is that the political moment at large?
*  It's the candidate.
*  Um, I think it's Nikki Haley.
*  Uh, and we tend to get the candidate we need at the time we need it in America.
*  Nikki Haley gets it.
*  One of the things that stuck out to me at the Trump victory party last night is that
*  they're not just mocking or kind of demeaning Nikki Haley, which there was a lot of.
*  There was a lot of mocking and demeaning of the kind of donor class too.
*  They would say pretty openly that, uh, the reason she's going to stay in this race is
*  because people who are rich Republicans are going to fund her money.
*  And what they're trying to do is speak over the will of the voter who have made clear the
*  kind of working class Republican voter wants to back Trump.
*  I guess I wanted to hear you respond to that idea.
*  But do you say to the idea that what the donor class is trying to do in terms of keeping
*  Nikki Haley afloat is against the will of the base Republican voter?
*  Well, I'm rich, but, um, but a lot of the donors are not.
*  You know what they're getting?
*  It's interesting.
*  The Haley campaign.
*  They're getting a lot of small donations from women.
*  And they're getting donations from Democrats.
*  That was a lot of Republicans.
*  You know, like that's not the base of the Republican party.
*  Is that all well?
*  I mean, it depends on what you mean by a base.
*  I think Trump just has a lot of people who they're just thinking of, hey, he needs retribution.
*  And they're saying, I'm not thinking about anything else.
*  And I hope that they open their minds.
*  And I hope that they start looking at it in a new way.
*  But I can't see that happening overnight.
*  What kind of my last question is to look ahead.
*  I know you're hosting a fundraiser for Nikki Haley soon.
*  I guess I'm asked.
*  I guess I do.
*  You're hosting too.
*  Okay.
*  I guess the question I have is like, what are the markers that you're looking for for
*  the campaign to continue the upward trajectory that I think we both know it needs?
*  And then a follow up question I have is this, if it does end up being Biden versus Trump
*  again, do you know what you would do?
*  Would you donate?
*  Would you vote?
*  Trump?
*  Would you, do you know?
*  I don't think that's going to happen.
*  And I think Nikki Haley will be the president.
*  If it were in that situation, I would kind of desperately look for a third party.
*  And I think a lot of people would too.
*  I think there's going to be a very interesting couple of months here.
*  A lot of things happen in politics.
*  And I think a lot of things will happen.
*  So I hear the first that being looked to South Carolina and Super Tuesday, investible
*  words to try to give Haley the bump that she needs and continue to close that gap with
*  Trump.
*  And then maybe a secondary step of this does get to a thing that you don't want being
*  a rematch of 2020.
*  Would you invest money in the third or you'll just deal with that?
*  Well, we might have to follow up in a couple of months.
*  I don't know.
*  The thing that went off in my head was, what do you call it?
*  Fighter run.
*  Yeah, the fighter flight.
*  Fighter flight.
*  Fighter flight.
*  Is it?
*  It was it with some instinctual nature would take it.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know which way I'm going to go.
*  I'm going to either fight this thing out or I'm going to run.
*  I said, ultimately, what do you make of this donor of Draper?
*  Is he in denial about the state of this race and the reality of the Republican party in
*  this moment and how representative is he of donors to Haley in both senses?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, when I talk to him, I definitely hear a person who is disconnected from the Republican
*  base, right?
*  To say the least, and Draper's defense, a lot of people are, you know, his presumption
*  that the Republican base would not come back to Donald Trump considering all the things
*  that have happened in the last couple of years was a widespread belief, right?
*  That was not just true among a donor class.
*  I think that was true among a lot of people who have underrated the consistency and cohesion
*  of the MAGA movement.
*  So I would say if he is in delusion, it's a delusion that's shared by a lot of people.
*  Well, looking back, why was there so much delusion given the steamroller that Trump has always
*  been within the Republican party?
*  Well, I mean, I think certainly post midterms, there was a overly presumptuous idea among
*  the party establishment that Donald Trump's electoral losses would start to weigh on the
*  base and that some people would look for other options because of it.
*  And one thing I think was the biggest part of the shared delusion was the secondary presumption
*  that his indictments would hurt him, right, that the candidates themselves did not have to
*  make Donald Trump unpalatable because the legal cases would do the work for them.
*  Which as we know has been not the wrong, the opposite of the truth, right?
*  It was more popular and more popular.
*  And so after the midterms, normal political logic would tell you that the electoral results,
*  the legal cases would inherently add up to a universe where Donald Trump could not be
*  the Republican nominee again, and particularly not at this kind of wide of a margin or clarity
*  of his off.
*  And that was a presumption that was made without the Republican base input.
*  You know, right?
*  But this is why it keeps going back to movement politics is because that's the answer to
*  why those rules don't really apply here is because they are not thinking in the traditional
*  political calculus and they'll tell you that.
*  They simply tell you that all the time.
*  I just think it's an unwillingness to believe them.
*  So the drapers of the world are not just trying to make Nikki Haley happen.
*  They are trying to undo reality, right?
*  And when we think about Haley's donors, all of them, I mean, how representative is draper
*  and his view of the situation, basically that if Haley loses, he's out of the Republican
*  party to the question of like how representative of Zia the larger donor class.
*  I think we've gotten some answers to that in the last couple days since the New Hampshire
*  primary.
*  Big donors like Reed Hoffman, the founder of Home Depot, who's a big mover and shaker
*  and Republican politics announced that he was going to take a pause on supporting Nikki
*  Haley because he sees a hard time seeing the path forward.
*  At the same time, there's clearly enough donors still supporting her that the Trump campaign
*  is taking it very seriously.
*  Trump announced that he would try to blacklist donors who were continued to support Nikki
*  Haley, a clear attempt to pressure people to kind of abandon her and make the party rally
*  around him as the presumptive nominee.
*  But the thing that I think is important is when you talk to the Trump movement, they
*  say they don't care either way.
*  They have multiple goals.
*  And the biggest goal is to return Donald Trump to the White House.
*  So even losing the general election is obviously not what they want.
*  Certainly the maga capture of Republicans has given them problems with independence and
*  they would need a Nikki Haley base if they were the United Republican party to go against
*  Joe Biden.
*  Right.
*  A subset goal, I think that John Frederick says very explicitly, is to own the Republican
*  party.
*  That's why it's important to see it not as a traditional political campaign that operates
*  in tactics, but to see it as a movement that operates in ideals, right?
*  Because the most important thing is to run a campaign that's based on those ideals
*  and they basically think they'll get with us or they'll get lost.
*  There's an understanding.
*  It sounds like you're saying that this effort to obliterate the Haley style donor class
*  and the establishment of the party, it might mean they lose the election.
*  They understand that Haley has not just donors, but lots of supporters who they may not
*  win over.
*  And because it's a movement, what you're suggesting is they may be able to live with that.
*  Yes, but for a member, they already asked Nikki Haley on the stage, would she support
*  Donald Trump in the general election?
*  But she's already raised her head.
*  The majority of Republicans are going to vote for Donald Trump.
*  No matter how much he mocks, no matter how much he demeans, right?
*  You know, Democrats work from a premise of appeasing a kind of liberal to moderate group
*  and expecting progressives to come along.
*  And the Republican base has basically appeased their most conservative sect and think that
*  middle will come along.
*  And we'll find out if they're right.
*  Yeah.
*  I think the specific thing this year is considering the staleness of the candidates.
*  Does that lead people to drop off altogether?
*  Does that lead people to vote third party?
*  How does that fall?
*  I don't think we know the answer to that.
*  Hmm.
*  Well, it's dead.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Monday, the most important United Nations relief agency in Gaza, the UN RWA, warned
*  that its funding could dry up by the end of next month after more than a dozen countries
*  suspended their financial support.
*  The collapse of support was the result of Israel's claim made on Friday that 12 of the
*  agency's workers in Gaza participated in Hamas's October 7 terror attack on Israel.
*  The United Nations has fired the accused workers, but outrage from Israel's allies has
*  mounted among the countries that have suspended support for the UN RWA are the United States,
*  Canada, Germany and the UK.
*  And a former IRS contractor who pleaded guilty to leaking confidential tax records to journalists,
*  including those of former President Trump, was sentenced on Monday to the maximum of five
*  years in jail.
*  The contractor, Charles Little John, admitted that he disclosed Trump's tax information
*  to the New York Times in 2019 and later leaked tax documents from thousands of wealthy
*  Americans to the news organization ProPublica.
*  Taken together, the documents showed that wealthy Americans like Trump pay little or no
*  federal taxes.
