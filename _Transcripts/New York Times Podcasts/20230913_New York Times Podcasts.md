*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro. This is a Daily.
*  On Tuesday afternoon, the U.S. government recommended that almost every American begin
*  taking a new annual vaccine for COVID, a milestone in the nation's three-year-long battle
*  against the virus.
*  I spoke with my colleague, a poor, volumundavili, about why the era of booster shots is now over.
*  And how exactly were supposed to navigate this latest uptick in infections in what to
*  many feels like a post-COVID world?
*  It's Wednesday, September 13th.
*  A poor, but we're talking to you just about an hour after the Centers for Disease Control
*  and Prevention. This is something they don't do all that much of these days, which is
*  to publicly weigh in on COVID, all these many months after telling us that COVID is no longer
*  a national emergency. So tell us exactly what the CDC just did.
*  What they did today is they've sort of reframed how we think about the coronavirus vaccine.
*  We used to have all these boosters and doses to keep track of, and they recommended a single
*  shot that everyone should get. The idea is that you're going to continue to get COVID vaccines,
*  but you should really think about this like the flu vaccine. You're going to get one dose
*  every fall, and that's going to be for everybody, not this many doses for this group and that
*  many doses for the other group and this very confusing melancholy they had before.
*  It was a confusing melancholy, that's not just me thinking that.
*  It was confusing to me too, and I write about this stuff. I think everybody had trouble
*  figuring out how many doses they'd had and what they were due for next and whether they
*  really needed it and what the cost benefit analysis were. And so today what we have is a
*  much more simple model. Here's this vaccine that we're going to have every year like we do
*  with the flu vaccine. It'll now be a part of our regular healthcare and everyone should
*  go get it. Right. It will become part of the ritual of getting a vaccine. And I have to
*  imagine that a big reason why the CDC is pushing this is not just because the previous regime was
*  confusing, but because the previous system wasn't really getting people to take a vaccine.
*  It's a bit of both, I think. Not many people got the last booster. Fizer actually thought
*  something like 100 million doses of the booster would be administered this year, just as an example.
*  And actually, only about 12 million doses were in the first six months of the year.
*  That's a tiny fraction. It's a tiny fraction and it gives you a sense of how few people really
*  were interested in getting the vaccine. The numbers were the best for people who really need it.
*  You know, older adults really did go out and get it about half got it. But if you think about
*  adults as a whole, fewer than one in five Americans got it. And that's just not a very high number.
*  Well, so what should we know about this new vaccine, this new annual COVID shot and how it
*  differs from past shots, the ones that we have talked about thought of as boosters.
*  For a while, we were getting the vaccine that was intended to protect us from the original version
*  of the virus that came through in early 2020. And we got several doses of that. And then the
*  most recent vaccine that we all got or at least I got the FDA tried to sort of hedge their bets by
*  having part of that, but also part of the Omicron variant. And so they were trying to sort of
*  protect us against both. And before we were sort of react, we had wave after wave and we were
*  just rolling out the vaccine as needed. And this was much more intentional. You know, in June,
*  the FDA decided, okay, this is what we're going to do. We are going to pick the variant that is
*  the most dominant. And we're going to design the vaccine to protect us from that variant. So it's
*  all a bit less rushed and frantic than it used to be. Got it. So it's a little bit more anticipatory.
*  It is. And this is a very familiar process for our federal health officials. They know how to do this
*  because they do this every year for the flu vaccine, except for the flu, they pick that variant.
*  And in the spring, after they've seen what the flu did in the southern hemisphere,
*  sometimes that vaccine ends up being a good match for what we actually see in the fall.
*  Sometimes it's not, but usually even when it's not a great match, you end up getting sick for
*  fewer days. You may not get quite as sick. And so it's still usually worth getting it. And that's
*  I think the hope for the COVID vaccine too is that even if they pick a variant in June and
*  everything changes by the fall, you'd still get some amount of protection from getting the vaccine
*  and it would be better than nothing. Right. And you kind of just hinted at this, but I'm assuming
*  nothing changes here with the function of a COVID vaccine. The idea is that the vaccine won't
*  necessarily prevent you from getting COVID. It's designed above all to make a COVID infection
*  my other. That's absolutely right. I think many of the vaccines that we've had in the past few
*  years have not been great at preventing infections. I think now we should really just expect these
*  vaccines to protect us from ending up in the hospital. We're getting really seriously sick or
*  dying from it. Okay. So now I want to better understand what the CDC has said about who should get
*  this vaccine? How broad or narrow their guidance is for age groups, populations, and so on.
*  It's actually really simple now. They said everybody who's older than six months should get
*  at least one dose of this vaccine. That's about as broad as a recommendation can possibly be.
*  I'm curious how that compares with the breadth of the government's recommendation for the flu vaccine.
*  It's exactly the same as for the flu vaccine. And I think that's another hope that by keeping it
*  the same as the flu, it will make things very simple for people to remember and understand.
*  Right. Okay. Given these very broad recommendations, I want to ask a few logistical questions
*  about this new vaccine now that it's supposed to be an annual shot. When exactly on the calendar,
*  are people supposed to get this vaccine? What's the specific window of time?
*  You should get it when you're actually likely to get it. Whenever it's most convenient for you,
*  is what I hear from the experts because they're so worried that if you try to give a very specific
*  window, people will just not go. If you can go multiple times, they recommend that you get the
*  COVID shot when COVID is looking like a problem and you get the flu shot sometime in October,
*  because flu usually peaks much later than COVID. Got it. But if you don't think you're going to actually
*  get to the clinic multiple times, then you should get both as soon as you can whenever you have time.
*  I want to talk about the reality that these recommendations from the CDC arrive at a moment in our
*  relationship with COVID that feels worse contextualizing, which is that despite the government telling
*  us that the danger has really passed, cases are actually rising right now. I just had to deal with
*  an infection in my own family. Several people on the daily team have recently been infected. I should
*  say not by me. Yet our access to hard data on case numbers is very different than it's been in the
*  past. It's a strange time to try to wrap your head around things. Give us the official lay of the
*  land. It is a confusing time because before it was very clear that COVID was dangerous. They were
*  rising cases. They were rising hospitalizations and deaths. We knew exactly where we stood and
*  where the cases were going up. Now, as you pointed out, we don't actually have great data.
*  The CDC is not reporting numbers of infections anymore. So we don't have a great idea of
*  whether and how much cases are going up. We kind of have a sense that they're going up because
*  we see it in things like wastewater. As you said, you hear about people around you getting sick,
*  but we don't know the exact numbers. When you say wastewater, just to be clear, this is the idea
*  that sewage is tested periodically by municipalities. That's how local governments can often determine
*  that COVID seems to have been growing in a particular place.
*  It's not a very quantitative way. It doesn't give you a really clear idea of how much virus there is,
*  but you get a general sense. You can see that it's going up. You can see that maybe it's about
*  the same level as it was last year at some time. But they're not exact numbers. We just don't
*  really have a clear picture of cases. We have better data for hospitalizations and deaths. We
*  can see from that that those are going up. They've been going up since July. But the actual numbers
*  are a lot lower than they were in previous years. Hospitalizations are about half the number
*  they were at the same period last year and one fifth the number in 2021. And deaths also,
*  there are deaths. There are 600 or so deaths every week, which is not nothing. But they are
*  a lot lower than they were in August 2022 when there were 3,000 people per week dying and 14,000
*  per week in August 2021. So that is a risk level that is significantly lower than in the past.
*  Been 14,000 deaths a week versus 600 per week is I think something like 23 times less lethality.
*  That's meaningful. That is meaningful. But when you compare it to something like the flu,
*  it's still worse than the flu. It's just a lot better than it was in the really horrific delta
*  period. So we've come a long way. But COVID is still a pretty significant threat. And it's still
*  among the leading causes of death in the country. And it's worse than flu, which we take seriously every year.
*  Right. What is the annual death rate from the flu compared to what based on the numbers we expect
*  this year to be the death rate from COVID? So that's from flu vary a lot based on how bad the
*  strain is on any given year. But there was just a modeling estimate for COVID that said even if
*  everybody goes out and gets the vaccine and the variant is really sensitive to the vaccine and
*  be respond very well, we could still see something like 46,000 deaths from COVID. And that's a very
*  bad flu year. And let's not forget there's also respiratory sensation virus, which is a third
*  respiratory threat, especially for older people and kids. Right. Better known as RSV.
*  Right. RSV. That's the third virus that we had to deal with last year. Remember,
*  there was the triple epidemic. And we had people in hospitals for months and months because there
*  was COVID and there was flu. And then there was RSV. There were all these things circulating.
*  Right. And you know, not everybody may worry about those things. A lot of people don't have to
*  worry about RSV. It's really a risk for older people and kids. And a lot of young people probably
*  don't think very much about the flu or get the flu vaccine. But COVID is a little bit different.
*  We're just learning that if you get infected with the coronavirus, you don't even have to get
*  very sick. You could still have a lot of long-term health problems, you know, long COVID,
*  long-term damage on the heart, for example. So it's not just like the flu. And I understand that
*  that's a bit of a confusing paradox. The government is telling us, go get the vaccine, but other than
*  that, no, it's not really a problem. There's no data for us to make our decisions. And yet
*  we're somehow supposed to try to figure out how to help ourselves, how to protect ourselves.
*  And so we all have to come up with our own ways of figuring out whether to socialize,
*  whether to go out or not, whether to tell people we're sick or not, all these questions that we
*  have and what we are willing to live with.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, O'Proof, I want to spend some time now talking about how we are supposed to navigate
*  this period of COVID, not just the vaccines, which we've been talking about, but all of it.
*  And I want to start with a pretty simple question around masks. In my experience, very few people
*  are regularly masking right now that just seems like a given. I, and then a confess, I don't carry
*  a mask around with me. A number of people I know don't either, but I don't walk over it again.
*  So how should I, how should many people like me think about what made up being the rare times
*  that we might want to consider putting a mask back on?
*  This is a tough one because before we used to be able to look at case numbers and decide, okay,
*  the numbers are going up, so I'm going to put on a mask now. Now we're having to make those
*  decisions based on what we're hearing around us. There are a lot of people who seem to be getting
*  sick. A number of hospitalizations is going up. And then you start to make decisions about
*  specific circumstances. I totally agree. I don't see the average person returning to any kind of
*  full-time masking. But if you know you're going to be in a crowded indoor space, that's usually a good
*  placed wear mask, you know, a subway train or a really crowded bathroom, you know, when I travel,
*  I don't really worry so much about taking my mask off on the plane because airplanes are great,
*  but airport bathrooms, no, I think I will put on a mask there or really any bathroom.
*  And any crowded indoor space where you think people might be sick, like the pharmacy or the hospital,
*  where you know people are coming in who are infected, coming to pick up their meds or to see the doctor.
*  So it really does have to be the sort of circumstance by circumstance, case by case basis,
*  if you're not okay wearing a mask most of the time. It's interesting. The pharmacy now that you're
*  mentioning, it seems incredibly obvious. Sick people go to pharmacies to get drugs or to get
*  over the countermedicine. And it's a very logical place to wear a mask, especially if you're
*  going to be standing in line to get drugs with other people for a long career of time.
*  And that's the key thing there, standing in line, right? You're spending a lot of time around
*  those sick people. It's the same if you go to an ER and there are a lot of sick people waiting in
*  the emergency room. You probably want to put on a mask. If you're just going in and out quickly,
*  it may not be as important. And of course, if you live with somebody who is immunocompromised,
*  then you're probably taking more precautions anyway. Right. That's a different calculation.
*  Okay. So on to testing in this moment. As you know, because I know you live in the New York region,
*  a lot of those pop-up rapid testing sites, they're gone. In my neighborhood, a bunch of them seem
*  to have gone out of business, closed shop, insurance companies cover less testing now than they
*  did in the past. So a lot of us are left with at-home tests made by various companies.
*  How good are those at-home tests right now at correctly identifying an infection?
*  They're decent. They all still detect the new variants that are around. But a lot depends on
*  who's doing the test and how carefully they do them. I think the best way to make sure that you are
*  positive or not is to do more than one test. If you test on consecutive days and you
*  try not to be negative, then it's more trustworthy than if you just did it once. But you're right
*  that there aren't a lot of ways to test very easily now. New York actually is sending tests to schools
*  that request them. So kids may still end up getting tested or they may send tests home like they
*  used to, but it's much more difficult to get a sense of who's sick. And that's why we're struggling
*  to figure out how big this problem is at the moment. Finally on testing, and this is admittedly a
*  bit of a delicate matter, I have noticed there's a growing reluctance to test even after an exposure
*  or when you wake up with a tickle in your throat, especially if a person isn't really feeling
*  all that sick because there's a cost to testing positive that folks just want to avoid,
*  missed school for kids, missed work, missed whatever. And judgments of that aside, does that just
*  speak to the reality that in this moment exposure to COVID is kind of the reality of living in this
*  world? You know, I can't really endorse not testing because I think you do need to know if you're sick.
*  You know, I completely understand the societal cost. I have two kids. I know that when your kid
*  just positive, the kid has to stay home and then you can't go to work or you don't get as much
*  work done and there are all these sort of ripple effects from that. But you don't want to send the
*  kid to school and start a mini cluster in that classroom. And you don't know who else is in that
*  kid's family. So I think people should still test and should still make every effort to not
*  go out and spread the virus to other people. But I guess what I'm asking is do you need to operate
*  under the assumption that many people aren't testing? Isn't that just reality? That is the reality.
*  And I think that comes back to masking. If you want to protect yourself, you may have to rely on
*  your own self to mask because chances are pretty good that other people around you are not testing.
*  Don't know if they're sick or are not telling you that they're sick. Right. So let's say you do test
*  and you test positive. In the past, that triggered this kind of shutdown of life, right? There's like
*  like everything closed and we quarantined. That does not seem to be the case for a lot of people
*  anymore. You know, people who test positive, they still take flights for all kinds of reasons.
*  They get on the plan, right? They still go to parties. I had the experience of
*  notifying a friend pretty recently. Hey, I'm pretty sure I've been exposed. Fair warning.
*  Do you still want to come over this weekend? And the answer was yes, I do. I want to see you. I want
*  to see the kids. So how do you think about the new rituals around all of this? Knowing that in this
*  current surge, people's tolerance for risk is pretty high. But you don't know if the person you're
*  about to meet has a very high tolerance. I think what you did, where you informed your friend and
*  let your friend make the decision, that's a great way to deal with it. You know, I think about it,
*  like when my kids were little and they would have colds, which was like every day, it seemed like.
*  Right. And if you had a social engagement, you'd tell the friend, hey, my kid is sick. Do you still
*  want me to come over? And it's you leave it up to them to decide it's okay with them rather than
*  you deciding for them that COVID is not a big deal. Right. So you're suggesting a kind of sick kid
*  model, which if you have a kid tends to be kind of automatic. I have a sick kid. Can I bring them over?
*  Or you're headed over here. You should know I have a sick kid. Apply that essentially to COVID as a
*  matter of disclosure. Ideally, you know, people just wouldn't go out at all if they were sick, but
*  realistically, as you're saying, if people aren't going to do that, then I think you at least are
*  obliged to tell people and let them make the decision. Okay. This might be something of a curveball,
*  but I've heard this kind of story from people in my life. They test positive for COVID. They're
*  headed to an outdoor social activity. And they tell themselves, it's going to be okay. Outdoor
*  transmission doesn't happen. This is going to be safe. This is really important to me. We are
*  where we are in this pandemic. I'm going to do this. So how should we think about that?
*  You know, I wouldn't go to an outdoor event if it was going to be very crowded, like a, I don't know,
*  Taylor Swift concert. But if it's a picnic with a bunch of friends and you can maintain some distance,
*  we know that outdoor activities generally say for COVID, there's very, very few documented cases
*  of transmission from outdoor. So, you know, you could wear a mask if you wanted to, but really,
*  as long as you weren't too close to somebody outside, it's probably okay. Okay. Here, I want to
*  acknowledge that we have been trying to inhabit the mind space of those who have decided that
*  taking a ton of precautions in this moment doesn't make sense for them. But there are, of course,
*  those who don't feel that way, they want to be very careful. And they want to take a lot of
*  precautions. Perhaps they are immunocompromised. Perhaps they live with someone who is immunocompromised
*  or they just want to be careful because they really don't want to get COVID. How are they supposed to
*  navigate this moment? Especially as cases rise and as so many people are not taking these precautions.
*  Right? I mean, that means it's pretty hard to be a cautious person right now.
*  There are ways that they can protect themselves. And we know this from earlier in the pandemic. You
*  know, you wear a good mask, you avoid socializing with other people or you socialize outdoors.
*  You know, you avoid crowded indoor spaces, all these things. But it is a little bit different now
*  because so few other people are doing these things. And so, you know, there's a lot of judgment.
*  I mean, I've heard from people who are severely immunocompromised who are going to hospitals,
*  even cancer centers where you think everyone should be masking. And they're the only ones
*  wearing a mask, even the staff aren't wearing a mask. And so, it's terrifying for some people.
*  In fact, there was a study recently that said that more people with cancer died during
*  Omicron when the cases were mild than during the previous winter's surge, partly because so many
*  fewer people around them were taking precautions. And so, the risk to them were higher.
*  Which presumably might apply to this moment as well. In other words, when people
*  let down their guard, the risk to those at highest risk is just much higher.
*  It is. And it's also a lonelier for them because everyone around them is doing something entirely
*  different. Right. Okay. So, given that this may be our last conversation about COVID on the daily
*  for a little while, I want to ask about the future, not just the near future, but the distant future.
*  So much has clearly changed in just the past three years of this virus. There's no better evidence
*  of that than the fact that we're talking about an annual COVID shot that we're supposed to take
*  along the flu shot. And the fact that boosters are no longer even part of the conversation. So,
*  I'm curious whether you've given thought to what this all might look like in five years, maybe even
*  10 years. And will this continue to be a story of less and less risk, do we think, and
*  loser and loser approaches to it or not? It's almost impossible to predict what will happen.
*  As you know, we've had that conversation many times, but we've been talking this whole time
*  with the idea that we're going to keep going in this direction where the virus becomes less and
*  less of a threat. And we all build up more and more immunity and we have fewer hospitalizations
*  and deaths. And that's certainly one possibility and one that we all hope for.
*  But there are other possible scenarios. There are possibilities where maybe we see a variant
*  that comes through that doesn't respond to vaccines. Maybe we see a variant that's incredibly
*  contagious, sort of like Omicron was and through everything into a tailspin. So
*  really the short answer is we hope that this will become like the flu and something that we only
*  worry about for three months of the year. We'll be just don't know.
*  Oh, Pura, as always, thank you very much. Thanks for having me.
*  The new COVID vaccine is expected to be available in pharmacies and clinics by the end of the week.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. More than 5,000 people have died and thousands
*  are missing in northern Libya after torrential rains caused two dams in the coastal city of Derna
*  to burst, setting off floods that washed out bridges, buried buildings, and carried entire
*  neighborhoods into the sea. The flooding is the latest natural disaster to befall the region,
*  an earthquake over the weekend in another northern African country, Morocco, has killed nearly
*  3,000 people. And welcome back everyone. House Republicans have uncovered serious and credible
*  allegations into President Biden's conduct. In Washington, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy
*  has opened an impeachment inquiry into President Biden, focused on weather Biden
*  in properly benefited from business dealings involving his son Hunter, and sought to conceal his
*  knowledge of those dealings. The American people deserve to know that the public offices
*  are not for sale, and that the federal government is not being used to cover up the actions of
*  a politically associated family. The move appears to be an effort to appease far-right lawmakers
*  who have threatened to oust McCarthy unless he meets their demands for deep spending cuts in the
*  budget, something McCarthy has so far struggled to accomplish. But while impeaching the president
*  is popular among conservatives, there was not enough support among more moderate Republicans
*  to begin an impeachment inquiry with a formal vote, so McCarthy instead opted to start the inquiry
*  on his own. Today's episode was produced by Claire Tennisgetter,
