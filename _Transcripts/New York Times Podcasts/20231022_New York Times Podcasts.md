# The Sunday Read: ‘The Genius Behind Hollywood’s Most Indelible Sets’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YWJScD9Rk8)
*  Noah Gallagher Shannon
*  My name is Noah Gallagher Shannon.
*  I'm a contributor to the New York Times magazine.
*  This week's Sunday Read is a profile I wrote for the magazine about a guy named Jack Fisk
*  and his work on the new Martin Scorsese film, Killers of the Flower Moon.
*  Jack is the master production designer behind many of Hollywood's auteur directors, from
*  Paul Thomas Anderson and David Lynch to Terrence Malick, Alejandro Inarritu and Brian De Palma.
*  Production designers are among the most important, but often underappreciated people on a movie
*  set.
*  Jack's job is to be the visual conduit for the director, to manifest the physical realities
*  in which these films exist.
*  And so, Jack is responsible for finding locations for the film's backdrops, building the sets,
*  and populating those sets with furniture, props, and anything else that might help kind
*  of speak to the thematic elements of the movie.
*  But what makes Jack such a legend in Hollywood is how he's able to bring the American past
*  back to us in such a fully immersive and imaginative way.
*  To him, too many period paces these days just feel kind of smoothed over.
*  The world is a little too clean, the buildings look a little too gleaming.
*  And so he tries to show how imperfect and messy the world actually was back then, through
*  unexpected details.
*  That could mean building a hundred foot tall oil derrick, for there will be blood, or a
*  Victorian mansion for days of heaven, or a 17th century fort in the New World.
*  And for Killers of the Flower Moon, which was shot on location in Oklahoma, Jack basically
*  built an entire replica of the town of Fairfax, atop the very real town of Pauska.
*  Killers of the Flower Moon is the story of the Osage people, who were forcibly removed
*  to a reservation.
*  Around the turn of the century, oil was discovered on the reservation, which made the Osage some
*  of the richest per capita people in the world at the time.
*  But then, some of the Osage, one after another, began mysteriously dying.
*  And what emerges is a conspiracy among their white neighbors, their friends, even their
*  family members, who are targeting the Osage for their oil rights.
*  Oftentimes we think of movies as taking place in sound stages, or using CGI.
*  But Jack is really interested in building full-scale replicas of buildings.
*  Even with everything in them but electrical and plumbing.
*  And that's what he's done for Killers of the Flower Moon.
*  Jack is obsessed with a certain kind of historical veracity.
*  He rigorously researches the lives of characters in a time period, trying to find something
*  that no one else has found.
*  Something that will draw us into the world, and make it feel vivid.
*  Sometimes Jack would literally rip the carpet out of a building, or peel back a few layers
*  of paint.
*  And all of a sudden there'd be hardwood, or a beautiful green paint from the 1930s.
*  And Jack would go, that's fine, that's great, we don't even have to do anything.
*  Jack has this method-like approach to building, almost like he's getting his carpenters
*  and his painters into character.
*  To imagine that they're from the 19th century, or 17th century.
*  Back then, they wouldn't have used levels.
*  They wouldn't have been able to use a tape measure.
*  And you know, in the case of a big movie production, where you have maybe hundreds of different
*  carpenters and painters, that can be a pretty demanding managerial task.
*  To get everyone into an imaginative headspace.
*  But Jack, despite being in his 70s, is famous for his physicality.
*  He's very hands-on.
*  And so he'll be up there hammering nails right alongside his carpenters.
*  In June, I flew out to Virginia to Jack's farm, where he's lived since the 1970s with
*  his wife, who, by the way, is the actress Sissy Spacek.
*  They live in this beautiful Civil War-era farmhouse that Jack's meticulously remodeled
*  room by room over the years.
*  The more Jack and I talked, the more it became evident just how central historical accuracy
*  was to his whole artistic ethos.
*  Most films we go in kind of knowing the story.
*  We kind of stay at a certain level.
*  We don't go deep.
*  And because it's everything we know and expect.
*  Then something throws you off-kilter and you go, wait a minute, I gotta look at this.
*  I think you can get deeper into it or you see it, it's like you're seeing it for the
*  first time.
*  At one point, as we walked on his farm, he explained the reasons why he went to such
*  extreme lengths to find, for example, the exact furniture the Osage used.
*  And I really got the sense that he was world-building in his private life too, the same way that
*  he does on the screen.
*  Why spend the time?
*  Why not just pick out some furniture that looks pretty close?
*  Well, because we could get this stuff and why not do it like it was?
*  The more real I can make it, the more I get excited.
*  You know, I always try to do something real if we can because why not?
*  Well, there's gotta be better reasons than just why not, right?
*  Why?
*  Okay, if somebody drives a car, would it be better just to have any car you liked or would
*  it be better to have a car just like the one he drove?
*  What would tell you the most about the character?
*  No matter what it looked like, if it was the one he actually drove, it might give you more
*  clues to that character.
*  If it was the furniture they had to use or were attracted to, and that's what they live
*  with every day of their life, it might tell you more about that character that they were
*  living with that.
*  They weren't living with this Art Nouveau piece that you found at the prop shop, even
*  though it might look better.
*  So here's my article, The Genius Behind Hollywood's Most Indelible Sets, read by James Patrick
*  Cronin.
*  Cahica Avenue cuts through the town of Pawhuska, Oklahoma, roughly north to south, forming
*  the only corridor you might call a business district in the town of 2900.
*  Standing in the middle is a small TV and appliance store called Hometown, which occupies a two-story
*  brick building and hasn't changed much in decades.
*  The walls cover its second-story windows, and part of the sign above its awning is broken,
*  leaving half the lettering intact, spelling HOME.
*  The space inside, in the language of the Plains, is humble.
*  Its ceilings are low, its walls wood-paneled, its floors carpeted in tight-woven grids.
*  If it weren't for the giant inflatable University of Oklahoma Sooners mascot in its front-window
*  display, the store would be easy to miss completely.
*  On winter day in February 2021, Jack Fisk stood before Hometown with Martin Scorsese,
*  explaining how beautiful it could be.
*  For much of the last week, he and Scorsese had been walking around Pawhuska, scouting
*  set locations for the director's 28th feature film, Killers of the Flower Moon.
*  The film, which is based on David Grant's best-selling book, chronicles the so-called
*  1920s reign of terror, when the Osage Nation's discovery of oil made them some of the richest
*  people in the world, but also the target of a conspiracy among whites seeking to kill
*  them for their shares of the mineral rights.
*  To render the events as accurately as possible, Scorsese had decided to film the movie in
*  Osage County.
*  It would be a sprawling, technically complicated shoot, with much of the undertaking falling
*  to Fisk.
*  Unlike production designers who use sound stages or computer-generated imagery, he
*  prefers to build from scratch, or to remodel period buildings, and even more than most
*  of his peers, he aspires to exacting historical detail.
*  His task would be to create a full-scale replica of a 1920s boomtown atop what remains of 2020s
*  Pawhuska.
*  The concern for the two men that day was where to build a pool hall, a set critical to the
*  film, as several pivotal scenes between the antagonists, played by Leonardo DiCaprio and
*  Robert De Niro, unfold there.
*  A nearby vacant building, formerly a hotel, appeared to capture the exact scale and mood
*  Scorsese imagined.
*  A vaulted space with columns and tile flooring.
*  But Fisk voiced hesitations.
*  He'd already spent several months in Osage County, touring buildings and studying land
*  surveys, and he thought the hotel wouldn't look right.
*  For one thing, the columns suggested a multi-story building of a type then rare to small towns.
*  He also wanted the space to evoke a conspiratorial mood.
*  A pool hall full of plotting power-hungry men should have windows facing the other proposed
*  sets on Kika Avenue, which would be transformed into a period thoroughfare.
*  They would want eyes on the town.
*  Fisk made the case that hometown's space and location gave them exactly that, an atmosphere
*  of menace.
*  A former painter and sculptor, Fisk considers his job not merely the designing of authentic
*  period backdrops, but the creation of a film's visual language, a series of subliminal whispers
*  to thematic elements, a character's taste in home decor, the personal history that
*  selects a bedside photo, the temperament that informs a paint choice.
*  He thinks of his art as one of believability.
*  A nearly invisible composition of landscapes, buildings, paint, and props that, when projected
*  on screen, absorbs the audience in a world that they know instantly, intimately, is
*  real, though they've never seen it before.
*  Transforming hometown would be ambitious, but Fisk suspected that the building concealed
*  a few helpful surprises.
*  Based on its height, he figured the ceiling was a drop, hiding a more soaring space.
*  Another tell was the plastic sign, which signaled there might be a hidden clear story that,
*  once exposed, would bathe the room in natural light.
*  After discovering that both hunches were true, Fisk laid out for Scorsese his vision for
*  the space.
*  He would uncover the original hardwood floor and plaster the walls in an aged olive green
*  before filling the room with a dozen 1900s Brunswick pool tables.
*  As much as possible, the room would be dressed with furniture and fixtures sourced from
*  antique stores and museums, rather than more conventional prop warehouses, and constructed
*  with period materials, like the slotted screws more commonly used at the time.
*  Even the dirt in the street outside would be carefully mixed to be appropriate to pre-Dust
*  Bowl Oklahoma.
*  But the strangest and most imaginative aspect of Fisk's plan involved integrating yet another
*  set inside the pool hall.
*  As Fisk explained to Scorsese, he wanted to make one side of the hall a barbershop, installing
*  half inch hex tile and a line of chairs and mirrors.
*  The script called for two sets, but Fisk immediately pictured combining them when he read it.
*  It was an idea that came not from research, but something more personal.
*  A memory.
*  When Fisk was growing up in rural Illinois, his mother took him to get his hair cut in
*  a pool hall, he said, a curious wrinkle of small town life that conjured for him the
*  mysterious and fascinating province of men.
*  Especially in period films, Fisk likes to find ways to rekindle historical backgrounds,
*  gone cold from familiarity into the warmed textures of human life.
*  People pay more attention if they're seeing something new, he says, seeing a facet of
*  reality they haven't seen before.
*  Fisk later pulled up the fire maps from Osage County and discovered that of the three pool
*  halls in the area at the time, two had barbershops.
*  Scorsese required no convincing.
*  Though the filmmaker, now 80, had never worked with Fisk before, he handpicked the designer,
*  granting him extensive creative latitude for expressly this sense of vision.
*  Since the 1970s, Fisk has been one of Hollywood's most sought after collaborators, legendary
*  among auteur writer-directors for his ability to help them realize their most ambitious
*  projects.
*  He has built boundless, intricately conceived worlds for Terrence Malick, the thin red
*  line, Paul Thomas Anderson, There Will Be Blood, David Lynch, Mulholland Drive, Alejandro
*  G. Inuritu, The Revenant, and others.
*  He is the artist filmmakers hire to bring the American past to the screen at the impossible
*  human scale it once existed.
*  Jack belongs to one of these now rare species of filmmakers who understand film from an
*  almost renaissance-like tradition, Inuritu says.
*  He knows photography, nature, architecture, drama.
*  When Scorsese began planning Killers of the Flower Moon, a lengthy process in which the
*  director radically revised the script from a story centered on the murder investigators
*  to one following the victims, Paul Thomas Anderson told him, You have to get Jack.
*  But Fisk, who is 77, can be notoriously difficult to entice to a film.
*  Since 1970, he has designed relatively few.
*  At one point he took nearly 20 years off.
*  When Scorsese approached him, Fisk was excited by the opportunity to collaborate with the
*  director, but also by the chance to excavate a world rarely depicted on screen.
*  The film takes place in a sliver of lost time, one wedged between more familiar depictions
*  of Native Americans in the 19th century and the well-worn imagery of the roaring 20s.
*  Bringing this moment of cultural collision back to life would represent as sweeping a
*  challenge as Fisk had ever faced.
*  The story unfolds in about 40 sets, as varied as Masonic lodges, Osage funerals, and federal
*  courtrooms, spread over a million acres and costing about $15 million of the film's $200
*  million budget.
*  The sets would represent a kind of culmination of Fisk's career-long obsession with reclaiming
*  the rough contours of American history.
*  More than any one aesthetic vision, he has sought over a half century to scour away the
*  visual cliches that Mar films, seeking beneath them the vivid wood grain and forgotten colors
*  of the past.
*  If Fisk's name isn't recognizable to most Americans, his imagery has shaped our collective
*  understanding of what a modern historical epic looks and feels like.
*  His signature is the 360-degree construction of the outdoor set, believably inhabited and
*  painstakingly aged, marrying an anthropological eye for period detail with a rough-hued naturalism
*  that can edge, at times, into the slippery atmosphere of a dreamscape.
*  For There Will Be Blood, he erected a 100-foot oil derrick, following turn-of-the-century
*  blueprints so that it might take on a more ragged, credible shape, planting it atop a
*  barren hillside that framed it against the sunset with painterly flair.
*  In The Revenant, Inuritu's drifting, magic-inflected survival epic about a 19th-century fur trapper,
*  Fisk scouted snow-buried valleys deep in the Canadian Rockies, throwing up post-and-beam
*  forts in settings so sublime that the film exudes the mind-silencing cold of the character's
*  icy journey.
*  But Fisk's work is perhaps most unmistakable as the backdrop behind the films of Terence
*  Malick, whose swirling, voice-over-driven narratives find grounding in Fisk's elemental
*  settings, ocean-like wheat fields, serene jungle villages, a mother's kitchen at twilight.
*  It's a fusion of styles the two filmmakers began exploring in Badlands, 1973, the open-road
*  thriller where Fisk met his wife, the actress Sissy Spacek, and have continued over four
*  decades.
*  As interested as Fisk is in historical authenticity, his work with Malick and others is driven
*  by a desire to build for-character and through-character, designing sets that manage to convey, in
*  the manner of poetic compression, a film's emotional core.
*  Malick rarely writes a conventional script, and Fisk never shows the director any designs,
*  an improvisational partnership that seeks to capture fleeting aspects of human existence
*  otherwise hard to render through conventional narrative.
*  Grace, transcendence, communion with nature.
*  On set, Malick refers to Fisk as, my eyes.
*  Fisk has a background in the fine arts, but he considers himself, more strictly speaking,
*  a worker, the conduit of someone else's vision.
*  As a production designer, he is in charge of manifesting a film's reality, interpreting
*  the fluid laws set by the director and script in order to bring its world into physical
*  existence.
*  A designer must not only come up with all the textures, colors, and moods of this world,
*  but also figure out how to engineer it all on budget, marshalling a machinery of illustrators,
*  set makers, location scouts, and set decorators.
*  A movie's magic often comes down to how well a designer can trim a script's price tag in
*  labor and materials without sacrificing its aesthetic.
*  Noirs of the 1940s are crosshatched with shadows partly to conceal threadbare sets.
*  It is a vast undertaking of dramatic invention, one that aspires to be seen, though never
*  noticed.
*  People say they love a film's cinematography, what they often mean is its design, what they
*  see within the frame rather than the way it was captured.
*  Until recently, no tidy educational pipeline existed to produce this skill set.
*  Designers tended to emerge from whatever field corresponded to the demands of filmmaking
*  at the time.
*  In early Hollywood, most were painters, hired to illustrate literal backdrops on massive
*  roles of canvas hung behind the actors.
*  As camera movements became more dynamic, so did the artwork, expanding to include full-scale
*  replicas and miniature models, the provinces of architects and sculptors.
*  During the studio era, backlots and prop shops supplied an interchangeable conveyor belt
*  of artifice, with each studio employing a head designer to curate a kind of house style.
*  Once the French New Wave and others pushed production outdoors, embracing unvarnished
*  cityscapes, designers also became anthropologists, hunting for spaces that evoked the right
*  reality.
*  Even the title production designer itself is an expression of one designer's ever-expanding
*  duties on one film.
*  David O. Selznick gave it to William Cameron Menzies after he conceived and constructed
*  several groundbreaking set pieces in Gone with the Wind.
*  Much of this history Fisk only learned recently, when Scorsese gave him a copy of Menzies'
*  the shape of films to come.
*  Unlike many of his contemporaries, who worked their way up through the art department, Fisk
*  doesn't describe himself as a film obsessive, and he's careful not to watch movies while
*  he's designing.
*  I always thought of a film as an original piece, he says.
*  The same way an actor metabolizes dialogue and stage directions, Fisk aspires to render
*  a director's vision into what he thinks of as a vast environmental sculpture.
*  What draws him to a project, he says, is a frightening sense of scale, the chance to
*  lose himself in the impossible.
*  Fisk's extreme commitment has endeared him to directors and crew alike.
*  Nearly every filmmaker I spoke with emphasized the sheer range of his physical talents.
*  Shape architecture, Finnish carpentry and portraiture, often executed in the same set.
*  But equally important are his imaginative depths.
*  There is something spiritual in the essence of Jack, Inuritu says.
*  Part of his job is to serve as a medium between what a director can't quite articulate and
*  what a crew needs to build, a gap he often bridges by simply doing it himself.
*  As Lynch told me, he will do all the research and make sure it's this and this and this
*  and then build the thing.
*  And if they sawed the wood this way, he would go saw the wood that way.
*  Jacqueline West, an Oscar-nominated costume designer who has worked with Fisk on nine
*  films, including Killers of the Flower Moon, recalls that when she met him, he was hammering
*  square nails into a set by himself on a weekend.
*  He's very method, she says.
*  When Scorsese began developing Killers of the Flower Moon, he'd long admired Fisk's
*  work from afar.
*  But initially he hired another designer, Dante Ferretti, with whom he made Gangs of New York,
*  The Aviator and several other films.
*  Then Covid shut down production and Scorsese began brooding over the direction of the film.
*  In early drafts it followed Tom White, an FBI agent then slated to be played by DiCaprio.
*  But Scorsese and DiCaprio worried that the framing privileged the wrong vantage.
*  So Scorsese rewrote the script, moving the film into the perspective of the Osage, but
*  also that of their killers, with DiCaprio switching to play a key conspirator.
*  It was a shift that transformed the film from a murder mystery into something less familiar,
*  a narrative that tracks the deepening grief of the victims right alongside the manifest
*  deceptions of their supposed friends and family, forming an agonizing portrait of complicity
*  and greed and white supremacy.
*  For Scorsese, Fisk now seemed like the natural choice to guide the film to its historical
*  reality.
*  Jack has a deep sense of the American past, the way things looked and felt, he told me.
*  In a way, he was the only possible choice for this picture.
*  But when the two men met, Fisk stopped short of proposing any ideas.
*  He prefers that his vision of a film be sparked by a director's, he says, which in this case
*  turned out to be relatively straightforward.
*  The party wanted to have it historically correct, Fisk says.
*  That's how we connected.
*  With both men nearing 80, the film represented as rigorous a project as either had ever taken
*  on.
*  For Fisk, it meant not just excavating a historical period, but also the most minute details of
*  real people's lives.
*  I didn't want to reinvent the Osage, he told me.
*  Fisk grew up moving between worlds.
*  His father, a pilot in the Pacific Theater in World War II, died in a crash when he was
*  three.
*  And after that, his mother married an engineer who ran foundries all over the world.
*  The family moved nearly every year.
*  Illinois, Michigan, Virginia, Pakistan.
*  Often isolated in a new place, he channeled his inquisitive energies into art projects
*  and building elaborate multi-story forts.
*  In Alexandria, Virginia, Fisk fell in with another artsy student at his high school,
*  a boy named David Lynch.
*  Like Fisk, Lynch had moved a lot, and the young men bonded.
*  Jack and I ended up being really the only two guys in that whole school that were interested
*  in being painters, Lynch told me.
*  They enrolled at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts together, but they were happy
*  to paint all day and avoid Vietnam, renting a dilapidated house across from the city morgue.
*  I had one floor, David had a floor, Fisk said.
*  We took an old coffee pot and made a water heater out of it so we could wash our hands
*  and face.
*  A break for both artists arrived when Lynch was invited to study at the American Film
*  Institute in Los Angeles in 1970.
*  Fisk had little interest in filmmaking but hitched a ride anyway, figuring he'd find
*  work painting billboards.
*  Oh, we sort of thought I would be an artist, you know, with no money and struggling, he
*  said.
*  I remember thinking, I'm going to try this for a year.
*  He arrived in Hollywood at a fruitful time for outsiders.
*  The waning power of the studios was making way for the so-called New Hollywood, a young
*  generation of filmmakers influenced by foreign cinema and eager to experiment.
*  Easy Rider had been made, and studios realized they didn't know what the public wanted,
*  Fisk says.
*  Through Lynch and his classmates, Fisk soon found work on sets, often because he was the
*  only guy around with a truck full of tools.
*  Eventually, Jonathan Demme, who would later direct The Silence of the Lambs, hired him
*  as an art director, a job unfamiliar to Fisk.
*  But it didn't matter.
*  The stripped-down vibe of independent filmmaking suited Fisk, who found he knew just enough
*  carpentry to teach himself whatever a director needed.
*  They would say, we need a church, Fisk said, and then you either find it or build it.
*  The simplicity of these directives was energizing for Fisk, not unlike the clarifying terror
*  of standing before a blank canvas.
*  He had few film references to draw on and didn't know about conventional film infrastructure,
*  like sound stages, prop warehouses, and theater flats.
*  So he relied on what he knew.
*  Realist painting, modern sculpture, building forts.
*  Union rules often make film sets workplaces of strict hierarchy, with each person tending
*  to a narrow scope of duties.
*  But as an outsider, Fisk was indiscriminately hands-on, doing whatever needed fixing, an
*  industriousness that quickly endeared him to young directors with tight budgets and
*  ambitious visions.
*  During the 1970s, he worked on films for several established filmmakers, like Roger Corman
*  and Stanley Donnan, and designed classics from emerging auteurs, like Brian De Palma's
*  Carrie.
*  When he learned that an AFI student named Terrence Malick was prepping a 50s thriller
*  about lovers on the lam, what would become Badlands, Fisk took it upon himself to compile
*  reference images.
*  Terry heard about this guy who was researching his film who he'd never met, Fisk says, and
*  we had a meeting, and it went kind of like this.
*  Could you start July 10th?
*  Perhaps no set in Fisk's career more vividly expresses the lyricism of his craftsmanship
*  than the house he built for Malick's next film, Days of Heaven.
*  The plan was simple enough.
*  Find a house surrounded by wheat fields where Malick could stage a love triangle among a
*  farmer and two workers in 1916 Texas.
*  But as Fisk scouted, he learned that many fields had already been harvested, and that
*  many modern varieties of wheat were too short for the atmosphere Malick envisioned, with
*  the characters buried to their chests.
*  Some of the only farmers still cultivating the tall varieties that laid in the season
*  were Hutterites, a small Anabaptist sect in Alberta.
*  But when Fisk approached them late in the summer of 1976, he learned they'd be harvesting
*  in six weeks.
*  The shoot would last two weeks, so to give Malick what he wanted, Fisk needed to build
*  a house in a month.
*  He thought it feasible, if he could erect only a facade, with the interior shots filmed
*  elsewhere.
*  But Malick insisted he wanted the wheat fields visible through the windows.
*  All told, Fisk would have about $100,000 and maybe a handful of crew to build it.
*  I was too dumb to know it was impossible, he told me.
*  The Hutterite elders were taking bets that we couldn't finish.
*  Earlier, Malick showed Fisk a photograph of a Victorian, an image that reminded him of
*  Edward Hopper's 1925 painting, House by the Railroad.
*  He knew a little drafting from art school, but the carpenters couldn't read blueprints
*  anyway.
*  So he relied on models, bending history and architecture to fit the emotional framework
*  of the character.
*  Many houses in 1910's Texas would have been plain and single story, as Fisk explains,
*  but you look outside and you're looking at a wheat field, and it's like an ocean.
*  To accentuate that loneliness, he made the house slender, ornate, with high windows,
*  like a ship.
*  He used telephone poles to anchor the structure against high winds, covering the exterior
*  in plywood.
*  Hutterite teenagers pitched in, along with a few friends, and Fisk furnished the interior
*  with antiques driven all the way up from Los Angeles.
*  Today, Days of Heaven remains a very personal film for Fisk, in part because it showed him
*  that a simple, handmade set could also be the most cinematically elegant.
*  He realized that building an entire structure instead of a facade gave a director the freedom
*  to explore and shoot from any angle, which helped preempt costly, time-consuming modifications,
*  while the open windows also saturated the photography with natural light and a sense
*  of depth.
*  At the same time, the relative simplicity of the house showed Fisk that a set's emotional
*  core had less to do with beautiful design than with connecting to the character.
*  Without a single line of dialogue, Fisk had managed to evoke the very heart of the story.
*  A man adrift, searching.
*  Everything Fisk loved about realism in painting, he realized, not just its observational eye
*  but also the stark modesty of its subjects, could be suffused into a set.
*  When he's not working, Fisk lives far from Hollywood, on an expansive farm in the mountains
*  of central Virginia.
*  It's a country of sloping hay fields veined with low stone walls and forested creeks.
*  When I visited in early June, the weather was breezeless and humid, the mountain outlines
*  shaded by wildfire smoke from Canada, and after buzzing through a gate and bumping down
*  a rocky trail, I found Fisk standing in the dirt before his and SpaceX two-story Civil
*  War era farmhouse.
*  He had just finished the summer's first hay baling and the rolls lay atop the pastures,
*  like beetles stranded on their backs.
*  Now in his late seventies, Fisk cuts the figure of a carpenter a few decades younger.
*  He is tall and broad-shouldered, with a center-part shag of brown hair and a smile that erupts
*  suddenly across his creased, goateed face, revealing a boyish gap in his teeth.
*  His hands are thick, and the pointer finger on his left is severed at the knuckle, a result
*  of a construction accident when he injected paint into his finger with a spray gun.
*  It was just like a sponge full of gray paint, he said, laughing.
*  He and SpaceX purchased the farm in 1978.
*  A wonderful, crazy decision, Fisk said.
*  Though both of their careers were taking off, they loved the miles of fence and roads, the
*  privacy, the quiet beauty.
*  The couple have now lived on the property for so long, tending to its growing seasons
*  and shifts in landscape, that it has seemed to attune Fisk to the slower, more methodical
*  rhythms of nature.
*  As we walked through pastures, he ambled with his hands interlocked behind his back, often
*  interrupting himself to recount a story about some feature of the terrain.
*  He told me that much of the farm was once part of a land grant belonging to the colonial
*  explorer Thomas Walker.
*  He pointed to the horizon.
*  You can't see it right now, but through the mountains there, that was considered the edge
*  of the wilderness.
*  Fisk tends to seek out films set in natural environments, then push the production as
*  deep as he can into the story's harshest elements.
*  He described how, during the scouting for the Thin Red Line, producers argued for shooting
*  in Central America, instead of Guadalcanal, the South Pacific island where the film is
*  set.
*  There were limitations to a far-flung jungle, not to mention malaria.
*  But Fisk was adamant.
*  An immersive sense of place about an environment so exotic couldn't be faked.
*  During a visit to Guadalcanal, Fisk noticed unexploded grenades painted yellow rather
*  than the more familiar green.
*  It was a vestige of an earlier design he'd read about, and one he had already planned
*  to include in the film.
*  A historical detail that didn't seem real.
*  When he saw it in person, he loved the unexpected vividness, the human messiness it suggests
*  about the war effort.
*  It was a visual confirmation to him of history's peculiarity.
*  It is these sensitivities to a film's natural setting, even more than his craftsmanship,
*  that his contemporaries view with a measure of awe.
*  Piers told me stories of Fisk plucking sagebrush for a paint swatch and kneeling beside an
*  elephant to coat its leg in a believable smear of mud.
*  The everyone I spoke with mentioned the austere splendor of Fisk's Marfa, Texas set for There
*  Will Be Blood.
*  When the director of photography, Robert Elswit, arrived on set, he was impressed by the scale,
*  but also by how Fisk integrated the set into the landscape.
*  He'd laid out all the buildings in such a way that made it easier for Elswit to control
*  the natural sunlight, both for interior and exterior shots, while also orienting them
*  so they were visible in physical and figurative relationship to one another, especially the
*  derrick, which loomed over it all.
*  His work, finding locations, finding the places to set work, and his sensitivity to lighting,
*  to time of day and weather, a lot of production designers aren't interested in the same way,
*  Elswit told me.
*  He credited Fisk with 90% of the Oscar he won.
*  Fisk says that he's attracted to working on historical films because, like working outdoors,
*  it provides him the opportunity to unearth discoveries that bring life back to him replenished
*  of its strangeness.
*  When I grew up, period films often looked like costume dramas, he told me.
*  Nobody was dirty.
*  This manicured unreality was compounded by his boredom in school and disbelief watching
*  the news.
*  He was a teenager when the United States invaded Vietnam, and his twenties were shaped by watching
*  General Westmoreland say one thing and hearing another from his friends.
*  It gave Fisk the uncanny sense that beneath this smooth veneer lay another craggier history.
*  He felt drawn to construction materials and paint colors in particular as tactile remnants.
*  He could remember how, the first time he visited nearby Monticello, the dining room was wedgewood
*  blue, but that they later found that that same dining room was previously chrome yellow.
*  This was the sort of history that truly interested Fisk, the mess of past lives, the mysteries
*  that lay hidden within walls.
*  Fisk's interest in restoring the original colors of history often first requires chipping
*  away the layers that conceal it.
*  When Malick approached him about designing The New World, his 2004 drama about Pocahontas,
*  Fisk was excited about building a Jamestown replica, partly because he'd long nursed a
*  curiosity about its construction.
*  Some accounts, including Jamestown narratives and the site replica Fisk remembered seeing,
*  suggested a fortress made of sawed planks.
*  You'd have to take a log and cut it, Fisk said.
*  Nobody has that kind of time.
*  He refused to believe that a fort built by ship-weary settlers was anything but an improvised
*  ruin, and so rather than rebuild previous renderings, he endeavored to recreate the
*  conditions in which the fort was originally built.
*  He picked a site just upriver from the historical one, laid out on a similar estuary, then labored
*  as he imagined a settler might have, quickly, crudely, erecting 15-foot vertical posts in
*  a time-saving triangle shape.
*  In the end, it was an awful, irregular structure, one no carpenter would lay claim to, but when
*  archaeologists from Preservation Virginia toured it, they were floored.
*  Despite how authentically bad the fort looked, they noticed designs that conformed to ongoing
*  archaeological discoveries, including Fisk's mixture of daub, a kind of primitive mortar.
*  Like a lot of Fisk's sets, the fort embodied a visual paradox.
*  It was historically familiar, but rendered otherworldly by a nuts-and-bolts attention
*  to detail.
*  When we see it onscreen, it greets us like a gaunt, muddy giant, standing in sharp contrast
*  to miles of clear tidewater channels and mossy glens beyond its gates.
*  And as the plot unfolds, it reveals itself as something closer to a jail cell, curdling
*  the settlers' bravado into a muted dread that builds into violence.
*  It's an accumulation of granular detail that speaks to the spiritual undercurrents of Malak's
*  A fallen Eden, but also to the ghastliness of being thrust in bodices and plate armor
*  into the muggy wilds of 17th century Virginia.
*  Fisk described the film to me as a turning point in his career.
*  Though he'd aspired to total veracity, the effort itself didn't feel like cold recreation.
*  It felt intuitive, imaginative.
*  Over his next few films, he experimented with ways to more fully envelop the audience in
*  the same sense of discovery he felt while working, a method-like approach to construction
*  that necessitated a set-wide commitment.
*  On There Will Be Blood, he threw out every level.
*  Another time, while erecting indigenous lodges for the Revenant, he instructed his crew to
*  find a stick of the right size instead of using a tape measure.
*  They start out thinking Jack's kind of weird, he told me.
*  Then they get into it.
*  They're becoming part of the performance, part of the character.
*  As we walked, Fisk told me that it was hard to know if audiences picked up on such details,
*  but that he rarely thought about it.
*  Worrying about the audience is like a painter thinking about who might buy a painting, he
*  said.
*  What I'm trying to do is create something that looks real to myself.
*  He once told me how, while building the gate for Jamestown, a massive swinging structure
*  12 feet tall and 8 feet wide, he ran into a problem.
*  I couldn't figure out a way to do the door because it's too heavy.
*  You couldn't make a hinge big enough.
*  But then he remembered an ancient gate he once saw in Morocco.
*  Built into rock, the doors swung on vertical pegs stuck into the ground and above.
*  Fisk had no idea if the settlers solved the problem this way, but using the method felt
*  right, as if he were tapping into lost knowledge.
*  An audience might not notice every detail, Fisk says, but their presence becomes part
*  of a larger immersive effect, like those subtle tics of an actor that, taken together, bring
*  a performance convincingly alive.
*  We think we know the way things are, he says.
*  Then we see something that's different and we think we're seeing it for real for the
*  first time.
*  Later that evening, Fisk and Spasek asked me to dinner and we drove down a tangle of
*  country roads to a restaurant overlooking a meadow.
*  So far during the visit, I'd seen little of Spasek, as she had made herself graciously,
*  if warmly, scarce.
*  At one point, after returning from a walk, Fisk and I found an artful spread of charcuterie
*  waiting for us.
*  Another time, as Fisk and I talked on the back porch, she hung her head out the screen
*  door asking if we might want a little sustenance in her breezy Texas drawl before returning
*  with sandwiches.
*  Now at dinner, she slid into the booth next to Fisk and asked to be caught up on our conversations,
*  exchanging teasing banter with her husband.
*  He's a deep well, isn't he?
*  she said.
*  As we ate, the couple took turns telling me the story of how they fell in love on the
*  set of Badlands.
*  To prepare for the film, Fisk browsed thrift stores, imagining himself as Holly Sargis,
*  Spasek's character, letting his hand alight on objects that spoke to the wounded woman's
*  past.
*  I had this little cigar box, he said, and there was a tin soldier with a broken leg,
*  maybe from childhood, and this clay mold of a horny toad.
*  It was a form of imaginative inquiry he'd undertaken partly thanks to a limited budget,
*  but one he now saw as vital to his process.
*  For him, this psychological profiling is at the core of his work, and no question is too
*  trivial.
*  What did I do last night?
*  Where's my comfortable chair?
*  Even if objects never appear on screen, finding them helps Fisk sketch the first faint outlines
*  of his designs.
*  When Spasek arrived on set, she was shocked and delighted to find the drawers full of
*  objects.
*  It was the first time I'd encountered a designer as character-driven as that, she said.
*  Repressing a smile, Fisk admitted that it was an approach cultivated partly out of a
*  desire to get close to Spasek.
*  He'd badly wanted to speak to her, but was shy and didn't think he had a chance.
*  That was a way of communicating with her, he said.
*  In the years since, the couple have worked hard to balance their careers, often finding
*  ways to work together.
*  Early on, when Fisk needed help on a job, he'd occasionally hire Spasek to work on set.
*  When Spasek auditioned for Carrie, she worried that Brian DePalma only knew her as a bad set
*  dresser from Phantom of the Paradise.
*  Once the couple had kids, they tried to arrange their schedules so one of them was always
*  at the farm.
*  During the 80s and most of the 90s, perhaps the most productive period of Spasek's Oscar-winning
*  career, Fisk barely worked at all.
*  He directed a few films, casting Spasek in two of them, but found the enlarged responsibilities
*  frustrating.
*  He was content, filling his days fixing up the farm and raising horses.
*  He was like a second childhood, he said.
*  The farm soon became a refuge, both for the couple and others.
*  Fisk built homes for their two daughters and Sam Shepard and Jessica Lange moved close
*  by for a while, as did David Lynch when he was married to Fisk's younger sister Mary.
*  Maintaining it all had become a daily meditation for Fisk, one he likened to the Japanese surrealist
*  film Woman in the Dunes, in which a woman is forced to sweep sand unceasingly.
*  I'm cutting down a dead tree and I'm like, didn't I plant this 50 years ago?
*  I remember carrying it out in my hands, he said.
*  It was as if the farm had become a living thing, one the couple continued to feed through
*  an ever-growing list of projects.
*  We've created a little world, Fisk said.
*  When Fisk began designing Killers of the Flower Moon, one of the biggest questions he had
*  to wrestle with was also one of its simplest.
*  Who was Molly Burkhart?
*  Burkhart, in a literal sense, was an Osage woman, played by Lily Gladstone, whose life
*  was upended by a series of suspicious deaths in her family.
*  One of the first times we see her, she is being ogled for her money and tenuous health
*  by her eventual husband, Ernest Burkhart DiCaprio, who is in every way her opposite, rambling
*  suggestible, greedy.
*  But she remained a cipher to Fisk, a woman straddling two worlds and two time periods,
*  tethered to her Osage roots by her mother and yanked into a boomtown's luxuries by
*  her husband.
*  If Fisk was going to illustrate her background truthfully, he felt he needed to find her
*  emotional core.
*  Because Burkhart was a real woman, Fisk was greeted by an unusually dense amount of research
*  material.
*  In addition to the sourcebook itself, he was granted access to many of David Gran's research
*  files, including court records, photographs, and interviews.
*  But Fisk also endeavored to unearth his own primary materials, conscious that he and Gran
*  were sometimes motivated by different imperatives.
*  While Gran had turned up a wealth of the most minute details about day-to-day Osage life,
*  Fisk was often arranging those details in different spaces or figuring out how to render
*  a one-sentence description into a three-dimensional building.
*  When Gran later visited the set, he was shocked by Fisk's attention to the most easy-to-miss
*  surfaces.
*  In the pool hall, Gran noticed a wire of wooden beads above the tables, a scoring system for
*  straight pool, which was the popular style before eight ball.
*  That's the type of detail I never knew, how they kept score, Gran told me.
*  One of the most important things Fisk had to discover and build was Burkhardt's house.
*  As well-documented as her history was, the exact details of its location and architecture
*  seemed lost.
*  Many in the production staff and among the Osage themselves assumed she lived in a huge
*  house since one of the most publicized details about the Osage was their brick and terracotta
*  mansions.
*  But Fisk was wary of casting Burkhardt's story in generalizations.
*  If you don't know where they lived, he says, how do you know what kind of people they were?
*  Determined to find something more definite, he pulled up court records, zeroing in on
*  testimony that described Burkhardt as having never owned a house at all, instead living
*  with her mother, Lizzie.
*  Following the lead to Lizzie's probate records, he tracked down a five-bedroom home on the
*  reservation.
*  Though he couldn't know for certain, Fisk thought the house's modesty, its open floor
*  plan and many bedrooms reflected Burkhardt's restraint, her embrace of her family.
*  Most important, he thought it captured something essential about the story.
*  Killers of the Flower Moon examines a moment of staggering transformation as the Osage
*  processed their newfound wealth and its consequences.
*  The nation had only recently been dispossessed of its land and moved to Oklahoma.
*  Now the Osage had oil revenues topping the equivalent of $400 million annually.
*  A house that wasn't necessarily wealthy but was comfortable, as Fisk saw it, embodied
*  that transitional confusion, as well as the danger it attracted.
*  It was like they were playing a card game with somebody, he says, and didn't know the
*  rules.
*  As Fisk began sketching, situating the house at a bend in a river, he drew in a low wraparound
*  sleeping porch where Molly and Lizzie might host visitors for the annual dances.
*  Outside, beside a brand new Studebaker, he added a traditional lodge made of saplings
*  and canvas where many Osage liked to spend the summer months.
*  Inside the house, Fisk selected a mottled green wallpaper, reminiscent of grass or leaves.
*  It was nature trying to get back in, as he put it.
*  It was a subtle permeability he suffused elsewhere throughout the house, open windows and cluttered
*  cookware from people passing through.
*  You start looking at the character and you just kind of build from the character, Fisk
*  told me.
*  What I try to do with the sets is just… find the essence.
*  We were seated in his office on the ground floor of his house.
*  Like every other room, Fisk had meticulously remodeled it himself.
*  The walls and carpet were matching palace arms red, a shade close to oxblood, illuminated
*  dimly by recessed lighting in the crown molding.
*  On opposite walls, over the couch and fireplace, hung the bust of a longhorn steer and an oil
*  painting depicting sheep huddled in a storm.
*  Fisk sat in a Finnish recliner and began explaining what he meant by essence.
*  Essence was a function of simplifying a set down to a visually expressive core.
*  It'll just confuse your eye too much if there's too many things to look at, he said.
*  A lot of design is taking things out of the frame.
*  During the final stage of building Burkhardt's house, Fisk often waited until the crew left,
*  then sat alone in the set, removing furniture and fixtures, night by night, until his interpretation
*  of the character spoke clearly.
*  I've looked at Edward Hopper for a lot, he said, because in putting together paintings,
*  realist painters kind of simplify the world.
*  They pick out what's important and what they want to make strong.
*  If some designers worried about a set not looking full enough, Fisk felt such simplicity
*  got to the very heart of production design, granting access to interior lives.
*  As committed as his career had been to American history, he was open to designing other environments
*  so long as he could connect to its characters.
*  Whatever expertise he'd amassed about paint colors or construction materials, he understood
*  as a tool for clearing away the visual noise that otherwise clutters our view of historical
*  figures.
*  This was the real reason to make a set like Burkhardt's house so accurate and yet also
*  so simple.
*  To create a surface compelling enough to draw the audience in, immersing them in the moment,
*  but crystalline enough that, as they leaned closer, they caught a glimmer of their own
*  reflection.
*  As Fisk and I talked, I found myself thinking of his set from the Tree of Life, a tree-shaded
*  neighborhood of wide lawns and avenues.
*  Here, Fisk told me that one of the few modifications he had made to the set was to remove its fences.
*  And now it struck me why.
*  Accurate or not, it reflected the film's vision of childhood's vast emotional landscape with
*  the just wrongness of a memory or a dream.
*  A set should be as real as possible but also universal enough to allow people in, Fisk
*  says.
*  It allows you to visit, allows you to become a part of your own history.
*  To Fisk, building a world was about bringing an audience into a life, regardless of setting.
*  It was the sort of delicate attention to characterization that Fisk loved about cinema but also felt
*  was rarer nowadays.
*  All you needed to do was look at the proliferation of fully digitized worlds.
*  It sometimes made him feel as if his whole approach to filmmaking was endangered.
*  His collaboration with Scorsese made it inevitable that Killers of the Flower Moon would be discussed
*  as a naturalistic counterpoint to the creep of an assembly line of manufactured content,
*  as Scorsese put it to me.
*  But Fisk maintained that his objections were more personal.
*  I would really miss a human element, he said.
*  He pointed out that he did see Guardians of the Galaxy, the Marvel movie with the talking
*  tree and raccoon and all that stuff, which I liked.
*  But then he paused, tilting his head skyward as if in search.
*  What would the raccoon's bedroom look like, he said.
*  I don't know.
