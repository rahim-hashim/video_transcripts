# 43% vs. 43%: Why Trump and Biden Are Tied in Our New Poll
**NewYorkTimesPodcasts:** [August 03, 2023](https://rr4---sn-ab5l6nrz.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?expire=1711061733&ei=hWb8ZbGhHIOO_9EP2-a46Ak&ip=128.59.177.249&id=o-AC9EprPa6fZZWDZDoG6Qhe8ln5qWiWPLXjvWtsKo-HLi&itag=139&source=youtube&requiressl=yes&xpc=EgVo2aDSNQ%3D%3D&mh=ab&mm=31%2C26&mn=sn-ab5l6nrz%2Csn-p5qs7nzr&ms=au%2Conr&mv=m&mvi=4&pl=16&initcwndbps=1276250&vprv=1&mime=audio%2Fmp4&gir=yes&clen=11340627&dur=1859.519&lmt=1691059025739820&mt=1711039017&fvip=2&keepalive=yes&c=ANDROID_EMBEDDED_PLAYER&txp=6218224&sparams=expire%2Cei%2Cip%2Cid%2Citag%2Csource%2Crequiressl%2Cxpc%2Cvprv%2Cmime%2Cgir%2Cclen%2Cdur%2Clmt&sig=AJfQdSswRQIhAIq-ZybScIAigVvwaBNUKy-csgDAVcU5PPCww9VagSkjAiAqU544FpTaLcS8XhRNdOQ7fYNUKUBa37nclP7cD-UZ_Q%3D%3D&lsparams=mh%2Cmm%2Cmn%2Cms%2Cmv%2Cmvi%2Cpl%2Cinitcwndbps&lsig=ALClDIEwRgIhAJd7reUCK8l5S6AmapwtNWbE-JZtlybekQUYw9Bel3n1AiEAgAsoG9PIn9xL_Xlou9f9w5Z78OSTXFLrRsiwCaBdx44%3D)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Barrow.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today.
*  Now the Donald Trump has been charged in three different criminal cases.
*  The biggest question in American politics is whether it creates an opening for his Republican
*  rivals in the presidential race or disqualifies him in the eyes of general election voters.
*  My colleague, Nate Cohen, analyzes a new set of Times polls that answer those questions.
*  It's Thursday, August 3rd.
*  Hello again.
*  Hi, Nate.
*  Is that what I think it just was?
*  The sounds I was hearing was that a partner obligingly getting rid of an animal from your
*  apartment so that you could record with the daily?
*  That is exactly right.
*  The things we ask of you all.
*  The dog was chewing on a treat and it occurred to me that there was like a hundred percent
*  chance that when you all really got down or listening to my audio, you were going to hear
*  the sound of the background or whatever.
*  I appreciate that.
*  Thank you.
*  We wanted to talk to you because the Times just finished a series of major polls about
*  the state of the 2024 presidential race at a really important juncture when the Republican
*  primary field is now fully formed and the frontrunner, Donald Trump, has now been indicted
*  three different times, most recently for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
*  Of course, we have learned from you to say that polls are not predictive.
*  They are snapshots in time.
*  But that said, let's start with the Times poll of Republican voters in the Republican presidential
*  primary, which feels very relevant at this very moment.
*  So top line, what did we find?
*  Top line we found, Donald Trump doing really well.
*  He had 54% of Republican primary voters to 17% for Ron DeSantis.
*  That's a 37 point lead.
*  I think that what you're looking for is crushing, not just very well.
*  That is a crushing lead.
*  It is a crushing lead.
*  It's much larger than the lead that Donald Trump ever had in the last Republican primary.
*  It's bigger than any of the leads that Hillary Clinton had in 2016 or 2008.
*  It's a sort of range where Donald Trump is a overwhelming frontrunner, at least if we
*  have a big asterisk over all of his legal challenges.
*  All right, well that brings me to the inevitable question.
*  How do we explain a lead that big after midterms in which candidates backed by Trump did
*  pretty poorly and after several indictments of him in the past few months.
*  This kind of a lead, given all that, does not at all feel like an inevitability.
*  So how does the poll account for it?
*  Well, it accounts for it in one of the most straightforward and direct ways that the
*  poll can account for it.
*  According to our poll, Republicans overwhelmingly reject the notion that Donald Trump committed
*  serious federal crimes.
*  And they also believe that Donald Trump is likely to beat Joe Biden than his rival
*  Ron DeSantis, even though as you just mentioned in the last election, Donald Trump's candidates
*  seem to fare quite poorly while Ron DeSantis did well.
*  And never mind the fact, of course, that Donald Trump actually did lose to Joe Biden three
*  years ago.
*  Well, let's show down to which Republicans you're referring to when you say that the majority
*  of them think Trump has done nothing wrong and that he's the strongest Republican nominee
*  to take on a Democrat.
*  And the group that I'm most curious about is the Trump MAGA base, this reliable group
*  of supporters who seem to never abandon him no matter what.
*  So what does this poll find about that group of voters in this moment?
*  Well, the MAGA base doesn't account for all of Trump's support, but it is a lot of
*  it.
*  The poll finds that the base of MAGA voters is about 37% of all Republicans.
*  And these are people who said that they had a very favorable view of Donald Trump and
*  said they strongly supported him in the Republican primary.
*  And look, that's a big group of Republicans.
*  It's more than one-third of the party.
*  We talk about it a lot, but it's an enormous achievement for Trump.
*  In our poll, none, that is zero of the respondents in this MAGA category said that Donald Trump
*  has committed serious federal crimes.
*  Zero.
*  Zero.
*  Only 2% said that he did quote something wrong.
*  So this isn't a case where there are loyal Trump supporters that acknowledge his wrongdoing,
*  but still support him anyway because of his views on the issues or because they're loyal
*  to him.
*  They don't accept the premise that he's done something wrong here.
*  And that obviously goes a long way to explaining why they continue to support him.
*  Right.
*  Because in their mind, there's nothing, literally nothing to see here.
*  I mean, it's interesting because I think this gives us a little bit of a basis in data
*  for what we have kind of assumed of the Trump base, which is that it doesn't view an indictment,
*  any indictment as any kind of harming factor to Trump.
*  In some ways, it may instead endear him to them.
*  Is that right?
*  It's possible.
*  I had one question that I think got at this, which is that we asked voters what they thought
*  Republicans needed to stand with Trump in the face of these allegations or whether it was
*  okay if Republicans didn't stand by Trump.
*  Not even that they needed to be against him, just is it okay to not stand by Trump?
*  And over 90% of these mega voters said that Republicans need to stand by Donald Trump
*  in the face of these allegations.
*  Now I should say we finished this poll before Trump was indicted for his efforts to overturn
*  the election, but there's not much reason to think this third indictment will change
*  that view among these voters.
*  And to this point, they have seen their guy as under attack and want a rally to his defense,
*  not that they see something wrong on Trump's part and that they should distance themselves
*  from him.
*  Got it.
*  So by my math, given that Trump has 54% of Republican voters supporting him and given
*  how big the manga bases, there's still 17% of Republicans supporting him who aren't what
*  you would define as his manga base.
*  So who are these 17% and why are they with Trump according to the poll versus one of his
*  rivals?
*  Well, first I just worth saying why we don't think they're part of the manga base.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's because they either said they don't support Trump strongly when we ask them
*  or they said they only have a somewhat favorable view of Trump.
*  So there's clearly something about him that they don't like too much.
*  Mm-hm.
*  They raise their broadly representative of all Republicans.
*  And we didn't really talk very much about the makeup of the manga base, but the manga
*  base is very populist.
*  It's blue collar.
*  It's very conservative.
*  This group of voters is more affluent.
*  It's likelier to say that they're only somewhat conservative or in some cases, you can call
*  themselves moderates.
*  They still have views that align with the Republican party as a whole, but they're not all in
*  one camp.
*  By their own account, they're open to candidates other than Donald Trump in the primary
*  campaign.
*  Mm-hm.
*  Now, they're backing Donald Trump over the alternatives.
*  So they're not an automatic vote against him.
*  And in fact, they believe that Donald Trump is more electable than Rhonda Santas.
*  And they believe he's a stronger leader than Rhonda Santas.
*  But they do concede that Donald Trump is not as moral as Rhonda Santas.
*  So there are cracks there that hypothetically could lead them to support someone else if
*  the circumstances permitted it.
*  They are, in theory, movable.
*  And to that point, do we know how this 17% feels about this giant looming question of
*  the president's legal problems, the indictments, the trials, the potential that he might be convicted
*  before the election or at any moment, and the degree to which that's just a vast liability
*  for him?
*  So, even among this group of voters who, you know, again, they're willing to say that
*  the Santas may be more moral than Trump.
*  But they also reject the idea that Trump has committed serious federal crimes.
*  And they also believe that Republicans ought to stand behind Trump in the face of these allegations.
*  And I should note, by the way, that many of the persuadable voters who don't support Donald
*  Trump and, in fact, prefer Rhonda Santas or another Republican candidate, they also
*  think that most of the voters who are open to Donald Trump don't think that he's done
*  very much wrong here, and they may infact see him as the victim.
*  Fascinating.
*  You know, there's an information ecosystem that is in play here.
*  Most of these voters are getting their information from a conservative media landscape where they're
*  hearing that Donald Trump has been mistreated.
*  The allegations are trumped up that no one else got charged for doing the same thing and
*  so on.
*  And, you know, I think we should be open to the idea that if that immediate environment
*  ever changed, that maybe voters would become more receptive to a different message.
*  But at least in that context, the idea that Rhonda Santas can get up there and say Donald
*  Trump is a criminal is, you know, maybe it would break the ice or something so to speak
*  on this argument with their Republican base, but it could just as easily backfire.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  So if you're Rhonda Santas, the number two in this race, and you and your campaign are
*  looking at this poll, and we know they're looking at this poll, you have to conclude that
*  there isn't all that much math to play with, right?
*  I mean, where does he pick up voters if 37% are unpersuitable and an additional 17%
*  are deeply inclined to see Trump as not doing anything wrong and stronger.
*  So what issue, what strategy makes any sense for him based on this poll?
*  This is a weird thing to say, Michael.
*  But I mean, I think that if you take all of these poll results at face value, it adds
*  up to a comprehensive take down of the Dacantus theory of this race, the Dacantus theory
*  and how they can win this election.
*  I don't think there's any good news for him here.
*  That doesn't mean that there's some other thing he couldn't do to get back in the game.
*  It's just, it's not in these results.
*  You know, if I were to explain the Dacantus case, I would say it's something like Dacantus
*  is the most electable.
*  He proved it last November.
*  Dacantus can actually get things done.
*  He did this huge conservative policy agenda in Florida while Trump couldn't get the
*  wall done and so on.
*  And then perhaps it's also that Dacantus owned a unique set of powerful issues that appealed
*  to Republicans like coronavirus and the fight against woke.
*  And I don't think our poll provides any reason to believe that those things are working for
*  him today.
*  Republican voters, as I mentioned earlier, they think that Donald Trump is likely to be
*  Joe Biden.
*  Then Ron DeSantis, even though Trump lost last time and even though Trump's candidates
*  lost them in terms, they think Trump is likely to get things done than Ron DeSantis.
*  Even though Ron DeSantis would seem to have a very impressive set of conservative policy
*  accomplishments.
*  And whenever we tested the, I'll call them woke issues like taking on woke businesses or
*  fighting the woke left in schools, they didn't fare that well.
*  It's not that Republicans disagreed and thought that Republicans shouldn't fight these fights
*  over woke.
*  They just thought that other values and other issues were more important.
*  So the idea that Ron DeSantis could overpower all of his other problems by talking about
*  this woke issue set doesn't seem to be supported here either.
*  Now, we didn't even talk about the coronavirus because that issue, which really brought Ron
*  DeSantis to national prominences in the rearview mirror at this point.
*  I'm having this image in my head of kind of Ron DeSantis's weapons as being kind of sticks
*  and stones against this like kind of vast castle that is Donald Trump.
*  And they're just not effective.
*  There's nothing here for him.
*  If they want to come up with some other set of ideas, I would think that they mostly had
*  to not be in this poll.
*  The weapon they were hoping for was in our poll.
*  They need to go back to the armory or something to finish mine, not that great metaphor.
*  So I'm doing my best.
*  So that makes me wonder if there's a glimmer of hope in this poll.
*  Any glimmer of hope for any of the other candidates who are even further down in this
*  poll than DeSantis, your Tim Scott's or your Mike Pence's for example, is there one?
*  Well, they're pulling very low right now.
*  I mean, Tim Scott and Mike Pence are at three and two percent.
*  I think that they haven't been tested on the national stage yet because they haven't
*  emerged as major players in this race.
*  Maybe if they did, it would go a lot better for them than it's gone for Ron DeSantis.
*  But given their extremely limited levels of support, the poll certainly doesn't offer
*  any cause for them to be hopeful either.
*  And I think that to your point about Fortress Trump, a lot of what's going on here is
*  about Trump's strength.
*  It's not about DeSantis's weakness.
*  Certainly, DeSantis's weapons aren't strong enough to bring down the castle.
*  But it's not obvious to me that the problem is the weapons as much as the Fortress.
*  And Donald Trump is someone who's been at the top of the Republican Party for the better
*  part of a decade.
*  And Republican voters have rallied around him in the face of the kind of issues that
*  would ordinarily bring down a candidate.
*  So I don't see very much cause for anyone else to have hope here either.
*  And if you had to identify what this fundamental strength of Trump is and how he has found
*  a way to project it so successfully, since you guys started doing this poll, what would
*  you say it is?
*  I think that the strength is his ability to dominate the Republican field and the national
*  media conversation.
*  You know, in our poll, we asked voters to tell us whether a word described Trump or DeSantis
*  better.
*  And Trump's best result on that was strong leader.
*  69% of Republicans said that described Trump as 22% said DeSantis.
*  And I think that gets at the whole thing.
*  It's very difficult for Rhonda Santas to look like the guy who can beat Biden or can get
*  things done when Donald Trump is the one who's dominating him on the airwaves and in the
*  national conversation every day.
*  And strength and leadership are big advantages for a presidential candidate to command by
*  this kind of margin.
*  Maybe there's something that could happen.
*  Certainly the legal allegations are a very unusual twist that we haven't seen before,
*  but no candidate with this kind of a lead has gone on to lose a presidential primary
*  with this kind of advantage at this point of the primary season.
*  And in fact, Donald Trump's lead is basically twice as large as anyone who's ever gone
*  on to lose at this point in a primary.
*  So he's in a very strong position.
*  So to close out this poll, for now, it clearly dispels the wishful thinking, if we can call
*  it that, of those who within the Republican Party want to see Trump defeated, there are
*  a lot of them.
*  They're prominent, the never-trumpers who have invested both their time and their money
*  into the idea that someone can rise up and beat him.
*  And that, based on this poll, is just not looking likely unless somehow Trump is literally
*  disqualified from running through a criminal conviction before the primary is completed.
*  That's what it looks like here.
*  There's not much good news to go off of if you're hoping to defeat Donald Trump without
*  something from above coming in to shake up the race.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Nate, the Times did a second poll.
*  We just talked about the poll of Republican primary voters.
*  You all simultaneously did a poll of a potential general election in which Trump faces Joe Biden.
*  And that seems quite plausible, based on what you just told us about the Republican primary.
*  And because Biden doesn't have a very competitive primary, is that why you felt comfortable with
*  the second poll having just a head-to-head lineup?
*  That's exactly right.
*  And I'd add one more thing, which is that voters know these candidates really well.
*  I mean, ordinarily talking about the general election 15 months out might be a little ridiculous.
*  But we've had this election before.
*  These are not unfamiliar characters.
*  We've literally had this election before.
*  So I think it's okay to start talking about this, given how likely the matchup seems
*  and how familiar the public is with the candidates.
*  Right.
*  And just to be clear, we do not believe that any of the people in the Democratic race,
*  like your RFK, juniors are meaningful challengers to Biden at this moment.
*  We do not.
*  We had RFK at something like 13%.
*  Got it.
*  Okay.
*  So what did this second poll, Trump V. Biden find?
*  It found a tie.
*  Biden and Trump at 43% each.
*  With heat.
*  Dead heat.
*  Which on its face does seem like a surprise for the reason you just mentioned, Nate, Biden
*  faced Trump back in 2020 and won.
*  And you'd imagine that Trump's weaknesses, especially his legal problems, would be amplified
*  in a general election poll far and above how they would be in a primary poll.
*  So what does this tie tell us?
*  What does the poll tell us?
*  So you're right.
*  Trump is weak.
*  And that's what the poll finds.
*  While most Republicans may not think Trump committed crimes, a majority of voters do think
*  he's committed federal crimes.
*  A majority of voters also think that he was a threat to American democracy after the
*  last presidential election.
*  Majority of voters have an unfavorable view of him.
*  And he lost the last election, as you know.
*  But Joe Biden also has weaknesses.
*  A majority of voters don't have a favorable impression of Joe Biden.
*  A majority of voters think that Joe Biden has not done a good job as president.
*  And so there's a lot of voters who when confronted with this Biden versus Trump matchup,
*  they simply seize up in polling terms, I suppose.
*  10% of our respondents volunteered that they simply wouldn't vote or they would vote for
*  someone else if Donald Trump and Joe Biden were the candidates.
*  And those weren't options we listed to them.
*  Those were options they went out of their way to tell us when we presented them with
*  a presidential election matchup that looks increasingly likely.
*  What you seem to be saying is that President Biden hasn't found a way to exploit Trump's
*  weaknesses because he has his own real weaknesses as a candidate.
*  But let's really explore what those weaknesses are and how they emerge in the poll.
*  I would put his weaknesses into three buckets.
*  One is something that could be a problem for any president running for re-election,
*  which is that voters don't like the state of the economy and they don't think the country is
*  heading in the right direction.
*  An overwhelming majority of voters still think America is heading off on the wrong track.
*  And voters don't have a good impression of the economy either.
*  Even though there's a case that the economy is getting better, 49% of voters in this poll
*  said the economy was poor to just 2% who said it was excellent.
*  And those perceptions of the economy are much worse than they were in the summer of 2020
*  at the depths of the COVID recession when businesses were closed and people were staying at home.
*  Now, voters may not be right about whether the economy is better or worse than it was then.
*  Leave that to the economists to debate.
*  But what's clear is that Biden is certainly not getting credit for the improving economy yet.
*  And he may still be blamed for an economy that voters simply don't think is good at all.
*  The second bucket, I think, is Biden's age.
*  In our poll, only half of Democrats think Biden should be re-nominated.
*  And half of those Democrats, in an open-ended question,
*  volunteered that they thought Biden's age or his mental acuity or his health were the reason
*  why they thought someone else should be dominant. These are Democrats who presumably should be
*  giving Biden the benefit of the doubt on all this stuff.
*  I just want to zero in on this. You're saying half of Democratic voters in this general election
*  poll, voters who, in theory, should be quite faithful to their party's frontrunner,
*  they don't think he should be re-nominated. And when you ask them an open-ended question of why
*  and put it to them, didn't suggest anything to them, didn't put anything in their mouths on this,
*  they volunteer age. I guess we should extrapolate that if Democrats feel that way, so do
*  independents and Republicans. That's always a good rule of thumb. If one party's base is upset
*  at something about their party, you can only imagine what the independence and the other side
*  think of it. So I think this is almost certainly a problem for Biden in some respect.
*  And I think the question that I have is, could it be the case that Biden's age is such a severe
*  drag on him that it prevents voters from seeing him as doing an effective job, even if he is by
*  many sort of quantitative measures like the number of pieces of legislation he passes or the state
*  of the economy, simply because he seems too feeble to believe he could really be doing the job.
*  I think that's a possibility. How much of his problem is in the second bucket? I don't know,
*  but I think it's above zero. Let's say that. Okay, what's the third Biden weakness?
*  The third issue is a little bit different from the first two. And that's that Biden is not
*  very well by traditional democratic standards among black and Hispanic voters. Among all registered
*  voters, Biden only has a 71 to 12 lead among black voters. And he's only at 41 to 38 among Hispanic
*  voters. Now these are small sub samples. They're just, you know, they're polls will have margin
*  of errors ordinarily. And then when you drill down onto smaller groups, those margin of errors get
*  even bigger. But we have seen these problems for Democrats and Joe Biden before in the midterm
*  election. Black turnout was really quite weak. And the democratic challenge among Hispanic voters has
*  sort of been steadily increasing over time. So although these are small samples, they're part of a
*  story that I think we know is already unfolding. And that is preventing Biden from
*  maximizing his base of democratic support and getting his number up above 43.
*  Right. And I'm thinking if you're a Democrat, there's a little bit of a deja vu feeling here
*  because that long story you're describing is part of what really hurt Hillary Clinton against Donald
*  Trump in 2016, which was that black voters didn't turn out in large numbers for her.
*  Honestly, I think this is a notch worse than that. I mean, what we see, what we see since 2016
*  isn't simply a low turnout among black and Hispanic voters. We increasingly see both democratic
*  turnout declining further. And now Republicans beginning to actually make gains. So it's not just
*  that non-white voters seem to be staying home. It's that some more of the non-white voters who are
*  turning out are supporting Donald Trump and other Republican candidates. And again, this is just one
*  poll, small sample size caveat, caveat, caveat. But that is very present here again. And that is holding
*  back Biden's overall level of support in the poll. Okay. So that helps us understand Biden's
*  weakness. And given that at this moment, he's tied with Trump at 43% of the electorate that was
*  pulled here, that leaves us with about 14% of the general election voters who seem up for grabs.
*  So what can you tell us about that group of people? Well, the main thing that characterizes this
*  group is that they don't like either of these candidates. But to be honest, they're not a bad
*  group for Democrats on paper. And they're not a bad group for Joe Biden on paper. This is a
*  group that's disproportionately young. It's disproportionately black and Latino. It's disproportionately
*  democratic. And maybe most importantly, it disproportionately supported Joe Biden in the last
*  presidential election. Now, the fact that they supported Biden last time doesn't mean they'll
*  support him again. But it suggests that the Democrats and Joe Biden specifically ought to have
*  an easier time than Donald Trump making gains among this other 14% of the electorate.
*  So this could ultimately be a decisive group of voters in a general election match up between
*  Trump and Biden. It most certainly could be, but they're not undecided in the sense that they don't
*  know who these people are and will have to make up their minds. Again, these are people who are
*  sort of recoiling at the thought of having to choose between these two. And maybe not even getting
*  to the point where they can tell us the decision that not only they made last time, but that they'll
*  make again. And there's also risk of horse that they really don't vote or vote for someone else.
*  And a third party candidate as an expression of that dissatisfaction. Right. So a general election
*  featuring these two candidates could very much be about not just who earns the affections of this
*  14% of voters who would break a tie, but who this 14% dislikes the least.
*  Yes. And right now, if the election is about who they dislike the least, it's really good for Joe
*  Biden. I mean, this is a group that's very hostile towards Donald Trump, even if it doesn't love
*  Joe Biden by any stretch. Now, I do want to caution a little bit on how much upside there is for
*  Joe Biden here. If we take these voters and we assume that they'll vote in 2024, the same way
*  that they voted in 2020, Joe Biden's lead only grows to two points. So it's not like there's some
*  landslide around the corner once these 14% of voters make up their minds. Right. That makes me
*  want to touch on something you just mentioned, which is the possibility of a third party candidate. When
*  you take math like a 2% lead or a tie, a decision by a third party to enter this race,
*  whether it's the green party or no labels, which is thinking of putting up a candidate in this
*  general election, that could prove extremely important with math this type.
*  Yeah, it's not hard to imagine how a minor party candidate or a series of minor party candidates
*  could attract considerable support. Back in 2016, the minor party candidates got something
*  like 6% of the vote. The voters are not as negative on Biden or Trump as they were on Clinton and
*  Trump back in 2016, but there's shades of 2016 here, where the voters at the near the center of
*  the electorate really don't like either of these people, which was not true in 2020. Where most
*  voters did have a favor with you of Joe Biden. So, how are you thinking about the rest of this
*  campaign, given the snapshot of the race that we have just taken with these polls this many
*  months before people start voting? To me, the biggest takeaway is that it means that all of the
*  events of the last few years, the StoT the Steel movement, the Supreme Court's decision to overturn
*  Roe versus Wade, all these criminal indictments, have not disqualified Donald Trump, at least not when
*  he's facing a Joe Biden with a 39% approval rating. And this race is competitive and at least
*  right now, the Democrats have worked cut out ahead of them and the events of the last three years
*  haven't brought this race to an early end as some might have thought. And if you're Joe Biden
*  and you see this poll and like DeSantis and his staff, you've seen this poll. What do you do in response
*  to it? I think that if you're the Biden campaign that your task is fairly straightforward,
*  not necessarily to pull off, but at least to identify. You've got to convince voters the economy
*  is good and hope that the news continues to be good enough to potentially boost those numbers
*  further. You have to persuade voters that you're doing a decent job. And you'll probably never
*  persuade people that you're not too old to be president, but at least persuade them that you're
*  good enough to lead the country. And then third, you have to remind voters of the reasons they
*  didn't support Donald Trump last time and why they continue not to like him in our poll, that a
*  majority of voters don't have a favorable view of the guy. Think that he's a threat to democracy
*  and think that he's committed serious crimes. Whether Biden can execute on that easily is not the same
*  as saying that the path is open, of course, but I think that path is straightforward.
*  On the Trump side of the ledger, I think that it's a little weirder to think about what Trump
*  needs to do in the same sort of term because the poll doesn't really suggest that he has an
*  obvious path to like 51% of the voters and I find it hard to believe that the people who believe
*  he's a criminal or who believe that he's a threat to democracy can be talked out of that too easily
*  with the right words on the trail. But what you can do is continue to keep your path open by
*  continuing to reinforce Biden's weaknesses. You can say that Hunter Biden and Joe Biden are also
*  involved in criminal conspiracies. You can continue to appear as a vigorous and energetic candidate
*  that maybe offers a strong contrast to Joe Biden's age. You can argue that the economy isn't good
*  and that prices are higher and so on. And that may not be a path to a majority. Donald Trump has
*  never won a majority, but does it keep a path open to another narrow victory in these battleground
*  states? Maybe it does.
*  Well Nate, as always, thank you very much. Thank you for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to another day. On Wednesday, jurors imposed a sentence of death
*  on the gunman who killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018, a massacre that is considered
*  the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in US history. The gunman, who repeatedly expressed
*  anti-Semitism in online postings, did not dispute his guilt during the trial. But his lawyers
*  argued that he should be spared the death penalty because of a history of psychiatric problems
*  and a troubled childhood, an argument that the jury rejected.
