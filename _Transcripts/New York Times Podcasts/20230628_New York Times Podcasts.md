*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Babaro. This is a Daily.
*  Since its introduction less than a year ago, Chat GPT, the artificial intelligence platform
*  that can write essays, solve math problems, and write computer code, has sparked an
*  anguish debate inside the world of education. The question has become, is Chat GPT a useful
*  research tool or an irresistible license to cheat? Today, my colleague Stella Tam speaks
*  with teachers and students as they finish their first semester with Chat GPT about how they're
*  using it, how it's changing the classroom, and the thicket of ethical questions that artificial
*  intelligence raises at school. It's Wednesday, June 28th.
*  Let's start by having you introduce yourself for me.
*  So, I'm Alianna Nourani. I'm 19 years old and I'm studying at UCLA.
*  My name is Aidan. Right now I'm in grade 12 in high school.
*  My name is Terry Dickerson. I go to Montcrest State University and I'm a junior.
*  I am 22, just graduated from college in Maryland.
*  And do you remember the first moment you heard about Chat GPT?
*  I actually first came across it through a TikTok. I think it was TikTok or Instagram.
*  I saw it seeing TikToks about it. I saw it seeing YouTube videos about it and I was like,
*  what is this thing?
*  And then I get back to school and I have every single syllabus I have says on it,
*  if you use Chat GPT, you will immediately fail.
*  And it's like, whoa, what is this?
*  Then I started exploring on it.
*  And I was like, oh, I know I have to use it.
*  And I was like asking your questions, like, do you feel anything?
*  Do you ever get lonely?
*  I was taking an Aristotle class and I'm like so confused in it.
*  And so I typed in Aristotle metaphysics.
*  And then it told me all about Aristotle metaphysics.
*  I was like, oh my gosh.
*  I turned to my friend and I was like, this is real, right?
*  Like this isn't a prank.
*  Like it felt so otherworldly.
*  Like I was watching a movie that was based in like the three thousands.
*  The way it types it out for you and you can like watch it think it's like mesmerizing.
*  It's zeroes and ones speaking back to me.
*  And I think I've used it for like most major assignments since.
*  All right.
*  My name is Andrew Reeves and I'm 46.
*  I'm a history professor at Middle Georgia State University.
*  My specialization is medieval history.
*  But being a small department in a small school,
*  I also teach ancient history.
*  I teach early modern history and world civilizations survey courses.
*  And what made you want to become a professor?
*  Oh, so one is that I find this stuff fascinating.
*  True, because I find it so fascinating, I want to share it with other people.
*  That is the biggie.
*  And three, there is a sense that for a functioning little democratic republic,
*  it does help to have the college educated people have a basic knowledge of history.
*  So there's the sense of duty about it.
*  But then there's also just the sheer joy in this.
*  Because I like this stuff.
*  I want other people to like.
*  Right.
*  I want other people to see that this is just as fascinating as I find it.
*  So I excitedly started a new semester.
*  You see, a hunker and ann, ready to go.
*  And I was sitting in my office and first discussion board post I graded
*  for World History One.
*  I read the post and I looked at it and I immediately thought
*  this does not read like a student.
*  And then I remembered thinking I bet it's chat GBT.
*  And it's hard to put my finger on what it was exactly.
*  But it's a combination of polish together with impersonal.
*  I don't like if Wikipedia had a voice.
*  But I felt okay, we've got chat GBT detectors.
*  So I ran through chat GBT detector and bang, it said 99% chance to be sick.
*  And so I just emailed and said, all right, here.
*  You've been given a zero because you had an AI write this.
*  So the first time I was not super flustered.
*  I thought, okay, this is just another instance of dishonesty we can deal with it.
*  But what was more upsetting to me was in an upper level class.
*  I was, I want to say about three weeks later.
*  And I was teaching Atlantic world.
*  What's Atlantic world?
*  It covers the early modern Atlantic.
*  About 1400 to the mid 1700s.
*  And I raised some questions about the steward monarchy continuing the policies of
*  Cromwell's protector.
*  And I read a post and it was a post that talked in too much detail about steward policies
*  for what I had covered in these readings and lectures I had assigned for that week.
*  It was with a voice.
*  That's the thing.
*  It was with the voice of someone who was fully familiar with foreign relations in 17th century
*  England.
*  And it was that too familiar voice because the thing about even a bright undergrad,
*  eight and a half times out of ten.
*  Even when they know the material already because they've been enthusiastic about this,
*  their voice doesn't read like distilled Wikipedia.
*  There's still their own sort of personality.
*  There's still their own sort of idiosyncratic understanding.
*  There's still something they may have missed.
*  They're all, there's something supremely insightful because they,
*  they haven't been swimming in the material the whole time.
*  And they can come out from an outside angle.
*  But this post had none of that.
*  And I saw that.
*  That was when I got the sinking feeling.
*  What did it feel like?
*  It felt like all of my certain piece about what
*  teaching was going to be like or crumbling.
*  Because that was when I realized that now I can't go to any student posts.
*  Then no, if I'm reading what a student wrote, even in upper level classes,
*  even among history majors, I'm going to be fighting this.
*  And that just, it was an effing gut punch.
*  I was disappointed.
*  I was sad.
*  It kind of felt like a little bit of betrayal.
*  But it was like all at once, all at once, this feeling of what in the
*  hell am I going to do now?
*  I don't endorse it, but I understand why a student who is taking World History One
*  in order to get their social science elective.
*  I can understand why that student would consider discussion
*  or posting to be a group to jump through.
*  But if you are majoring in history, you should be interested in
*  enough in this that you can sit down and write 600 words about it over two weeks.
*  So every time now I see a student post that looks like they know the material well,
*  my first thought isn't a hot.
*  This is a good student who has read the material.
*  My first thought is did a robot write this?
*  Every discussion board post that I see, it's gone from a sense of delight and anticipation
*  when I click to say what have a student said to a sense of suspicion and irritation
*  that I am having to turn test each and every post.
*  Right.
*  So there was this growing anger and ease distress that from here on out,
*  there was going to be this call of suspicion hanging over every student post.
*  I mean, did you ever doubt yourself?
*  Did you doubt your suspicions and also the the GPT detectors, which have been shown not to be
*  entirely accurate?
*  Uh-huh.
*  Yes.
*  There is a vast grey zone of areas where I don't know.
*  Is this a student who knows the material well and is grammatically capable?
*  Is this a robot?
*  And I am near certain that robot-generated posts have gotten past me
*  because I don't normally go in guns blazing in terms of disciplinary action.
*  And I would rather there be false negatives than false positives.
*  And I don't like going into course discussions with an adversarial mindset.
*  I want it to be where people learn things.
*  Yeah.
*  I love to talk more about that.
*  How does that affect your approach to teaching and your relationship to your students?
*  So clicking open the discussion board and realizing that I might be reading
*  text generated by a machine that has no inner life.
*  That's that, you know, I feel I feel like, do you remember the psychology experiment when they
*  got the little baby monkey and was hugging the model of a monkey because it needed something to
*  have contact with, but it was hugging this piece of machinery.
*  I'm not being overly dramatic.
*  I might be being overly dramatic, but I feel like I feel like that.
*  It's like, am I a duck swimming up to a decoy excitedly trying to mate with a piece of floating wood?
*  I mean, that's what I feel like.
*  I mean, the joy of talking to the student is what it's that there's this other human out there
*  that I'm connecting with.
*  And when they're talking to each other on the discussion boards,
*  that they're connecting to other humans.
*  And the idea of robots and eventually maybe robots talking to robots and no humans there.
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  I sort of have this terrible feeling that, you know, the future is this
*  this road going into darkness and I have no idea what's at the end of it.
*  After the break, stories from students.
*  So tell me a little bit about how you've used chat GBT for school.
*  When I had first heard it a while ago, I was like, I'm not going to touch it.
*  I really pride myself who I am as a student and I'm very dedicated to my academic.
*  So I was like, I'm not even going to go near this thing.
*  I'm just going to be authentic in the work that I submit.
*  I don't use it to like analyze things or write my answers for me because, you know,
*  I think so much for this education.
*  It kind of feels like it would just undercut all the value of it to cheat.
*  Like I could, I'm learning how to critical think.
*  So why would I want AI to do that for me?
*  But after using it with my friend, I was like, okay, there is a way for this resource to be used,
*  aside from how students have been using it for plagiarism.
*  I did use it for an English assignment where I was analyzing Baywolf.
*  And I had no idea what was going on in the story because it was impossible to understand.
*  So I typed in Baywolf after 40, whatever into that GBT and it pumped out just a quick summary.
*  I had this exam to study for.
*  I'm not very good at math.
*  And I was like, maybe this thing can explain to me how this math is working right now.
*  So I gave it all of the stats and immediately populated a step-by-step process of how to do
*  to division, what everything met.
*  And I was like, wow, this was so, so, so helpful.
*  How would you have handled that situation before chat GBT?
*  To be so honest, I probably would have just had the muster up the courage to just ask of class
*  me, but it kind of eliminated that awkward step.
*  I think I would have just had to ask a friend or try harder, which now that I'm thinking about it,
*  I probably should have just done that.
*  Do you feel like you lost out on anything by using chat GBT in that way?
*  I think there is something missed when you don't just go up to your classmates and ask for help.
*  In the moment, I just really needed the answer.
*  But I think the downsides of constantly going to chat GBT would be that you missed that one-to-one
*  connection that you could be having with a classmate, that you could be having with a professor,
*  and really connecting and bonding over the material that you're discussing.
*  Sometimes I worry that I'm not a good critical thinker and that I'm only getting like the
*  shallow level of the things I read.
*  And the good thing about chat GBT is it kind of like tells you what you're missing,
*  which I guess is making me a worse reader because I'm not learning about my own, but it didn't
*  give me an analysis. So as long as it's not giving me ideas, I see it's hard to know what it's
*  going to crank out. So it's hard to know whether it's going to give you ideas, but I just,
*  I, yeah, the line is getting a little blurry now.
*  Yeah, I think as I'm like giving you examples, I'm realizing, oh my gosh, it really is just
*  for critical thinking, and that's what I'm using it for. And I have like this
*  internal law that I will not find shortcuts in analysis, but I totally am doing that.
*  I don't think there's a way to use it and not do that because it will think for you.
*  If you give it a question, it'll just think for you.
*  I'm 22 years old and I went to a university in California for computer science.
*  I'm a recent grad and I studied finance.
*  I am 24 years old. I just completed my masters in health sciences.
*  And you want to be anonymous.
*  Yes, please.
*  Have you ever directly copied and pasted from chat GPT and turned it in for an assignment?
*  Yeah.
*  It was like towards the end of the semester. I had a good amount of papers and final projects
*  coming up for like a multitude of classes. I was like feeling very stressed about it.
*  And for me, especially I despise writing papers like, I'll do mass problems and econ problems
*  all day. But researching and writing papers feels like the being of my academic existence.
*  I started using it to sort of create the structure of my papers.
*  I would just do like stream of consciousness on a doc and then it would package everything
*  that I said in it and then I would be able to like tweak it.
*  The first time I used it, I was writing like a discussion post or whatever.
*  So I just like copy paste the problem and then it gave me a response.
*  Oh my god, it was so good. It was so good. It was amazing.
*  Like it just wrote everything out clearly and like the session structure was so good too.
*  It wasn't the most detailed. I was like, dang, I can work with this.
*  No, I can like rearrange and just add some little more specific details.
*  Out of paranoia, I used a lot of plagiarism platforms to see if it even detected AI.
*  And then my use of it became more and more complex as I began to trust it.
*  So I was going to write about like a criminal justice system and that's like the deadline
*  encroached on me. I was like, yeah, I'm not really finishing this.
*  So I started having like a conversation with chat GPP.
*  Well, I was like, okay, I want you to write 500 words talking about this topic.
*  And it did it. I read through it and I was like, okay, this is good work.
*  But it doesn't really sound like me.
*  So then I gave chat GPP. I was like, I'm going to give you something that I've already written.
*  And I want you to rewrite this paragraph to make it sound like me.
*  So I copy pasted the page of what I'd already written.
*  And then it rewrote that paragraph and I was like, okay, this works.
*  And then I pasted those sections into my final paper.
*  Now I rewrote it a little bit, make it sound like less robotic.
*  And then I'm like, beep beep, poop, poop, turn it in, submit.
*  Tell us, Heather, good job. Nice work.
*  Oh, my god. Thank you.
*  It was 10 out of 10.
*  Yeah, I got a name.
*  And my professor actually liked the chat GPP part of the paper more than mine.
*  She gave us back our edits.
*  And the first half of the paper that I've written is full of like,
*  correct is here, correct is there.
*  And then literally around the part where I started using chat GPP,
*  the correction just reduced drastically to like a sentence per page or something
*  for like the next four pages.
*  And I was like, so chat GPP literally made better quality work than I did.
*  Every opportunity I have for them, I would use chat GPP.
*  You know what I mean? Like first case.
*  Hey, what's up chat GPP? How do I need it?
*  Did you have any feelings about using chat GPP to do your work in this life?
*  Not really.
*  Like do I feel guilty about using chat GPP?
*  No, in the moment I was like even more excited.
*  I would like do.
*  It's too easy.
*  Like I can go outside, I can touch grass or something.
*  I felt a little like damn like, is this what I came to school for to like not do the work.
*  At a good excuse, like I felt like this class was not important to me.
*  It was a requirement, but it was an antiquated requirement.
*  It was a Brazilian studies class.
*  Like I got to take a history class to fulfill a requirement.
*  It's also been really interested in like it's cool to learn about Brazil.
*  But at the other day, I'm just trying to pass the course.
*  You don't feel like you kind of cheated yourself out of learning by using chat GPP to do these
*  I didn't really feel that bad about it to be honest.
*  If GPA is everything, then students are only going to care about grades.
*  And GPA is pretty much everything.
*  Your internship applications, your job applications, like they literally have
*  of these like GPA requirements.
*  So I feel like it's at emphasis on grading and GPA.
*  That pushes students to use whatever means that they can.
*  College, we pay hell of money, right?
*  We're just trying to get a degree.
*  That's it credentials.
*  It's like I'm just I'm stressed.
*  I really need to get this degree so I can get a job so I can survive.
*  Oh man.
*  So what does that remind you of?
*  And it's really hard to like be like, oh, no, let's learn.
*  Everybody's there.
*  Well, what would you say to students who might say it's not fair that you use chat GPP like this?
*  I mean, I can understand feeling pissed off when you did all that work.
*  And you found out that other people like got there easier, right?
*  And it just makes you feel like all your work was invalidated, right?
*  I understand your feelings of like unfairness.
*  Because I also used to feel that way too, but it's like the whole world is unfair already.
*  People are going to get job and get picked for position just off of
*  knowing someone or some weird connection or whatever.
*  Like the system is already unfair.
*  So it's up to you.
*  It's trying like get it how you get it.
*  I would say like it's going to be the same case for like people who didn't learn how to type when
*  you know computers came out.
*  And I feel like over time it's going to be used in a variety of different industries.
*  So it's like it's not cheating.
*  It's just like learning how to use a new tool.
*  My viewpoint on education has changed quite a bit.
*  Over, you know, I've been in school for 13 plus years.
*  And I realized that, you know, the workforce that we're entering after being students,
*  it's Vast case and it's who could get the information there, the fastest, the quickest,
*  and in the most concise manner.
*  And if you could identify tools that could help you do that,
*  while still having somewhat of a foundational understanding of what it's doing,
*  I see it as more of an extension of our abilities as opposed to like cheating.
*  We live in an age now where like literally any piece of information I want, I could have it
*  immediately.
*  So it's just like what is the incentive to really, really learn to like memorize
*  if you have like this external brain that could do it for you.
*  So Andrew, earlier you mentioned a feeling of betrayal when you found out that your students
*  were using chat GPT.
*  Yeah.
*  And I'm wondering what the betrayal is of, is it of you, of the material, of the ideal of learning
*  in a college setting? I mean, who or what is being betrayed here?
*  I think it's a betrayal of the purpose of a university class where on this journey together is
*  my feeling about a class.
*  And so I suspect one reason it hit so hard for me is that a great many students never saw
*  themselves on a voyage of discovery along with me. They saw themselves in route to a credential.
*  And to some extent the upset is my realizing that not everyone is going to see this as a
*  magnificent voyage of discovery.
*  Well, have you talked to your students about chat GPT?
*  I need to do that at some point.
*  I think that chat GPT opens up a teachable moment for getting students to think about
*  why do you learn to do stuff that a machine can do?
*  Why do you learn to do the math when I can realistically just pull out my phone
*  and get my phone to do it?
*  Why do math students still learn?
*  One plus one is two, for example.
*  Why do we still learn these things?
*  And I think, I hope this is not me just telling myself I am still relevant,
*  but I think that the writing process, especially or the thinking process,
*  what's important for a student is their learning how to organize their own thoughts,
*  their learning how to really express themselves and to think clearly.
*  And that's the value of having people write.
*  And it's the value of having people think about stuff they read.
*  It's not just checking up the facts and spitting them back out.
*  It's taking, and you've got to have the facts in your head to chew on,
*  to think about, to train yourself as a thinker.
*  And I think that, as I've had this conversation, it's helped me to think about how
*  this could be a very teachable moment, especially at the outset of the semester,
*  in a way to say, here's why we're doing this,
*  rather than, you know, I will come down on you with the wrath of God if you decide to cheat with robots.
*  Andru, thank you so much for this conversation.
*  Well, it was a privilege getting to think out a lot about all this stuff.
*  Thank you very much for talking to me about this.
*  Take care.
*  You too.
*  Bye.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Tuesday, the Supreme Court rejected the legal theory that state legislatures have
*  almost unchecked power to create the rules for federal elections and draw partisan election maps
*  without oversight from state-level courts.
*  The case stemmed from a voting map drawn by North Carolina's Republican-controlled legislature
*  that was later thrown out by the state's Supreme Court as overly partisan.
*  North Carolina Republicans seeking to restore that map, asked the US Supreme Court to intervene,
*  saying the state court had no say over the matter.
*  By a vote of 6-3, the Supreme Court's justices disagreed, saying that state courts do have a
*  role to play in such disputes. Many legal experts celebrated the ruling, saying it would avoid
*  introducing even more partisanship into federal elections.
