*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, a massive micro-generation of babies born in the early 1990s have ended up in a
*  lifelong competition for everything that is shaping both their lives and the entire U.S.
*  economy.
*  For better or worse, my colleague, Gina Smilak, is one of them.
*  It's Thursday, March 14th.
*  Hi Gina.
*  Hi Michael.
*  How's it going?
*  It's going alright.
*  I'm excited for this conversation.
*  About you.
*  About peak millennials.
*  So, we usually come to you to talk about the biggest trends in the U.S. economy.
*  We talked to you about what the federal reserve is up to.
*  Interest rates being raised, interest rates being lowered, the state of inflation, but today's
*  different.
*  As I'm hinting at, this is going to be a conversation focused on the economy.
*  But today's different.
*  As I'm hinting at, this is going to be a conversation focused on you and people like you.
*  Oh man.
*  It makes me sound like a narcissist, which I guess is somewhat appropriate.
*  So, just tell us how you came to this.
*  Yeah.
*  So, I am an economics reporter and I've always been interested in demographics.
*  And because I've been covering economics for over a decade at this point, one thing that
*  I've consistently noticed is that every time I make a really big life decision, it seems
*  like a huge portion of the U.S. economy has been making that decision right along with me,
*  basically at the exact same time.
*  So, for a couple of concrete examples here, the year I bought a house, the housing market just went absolutely
*  crazy.
*  When I rented my first apartment, rental prices in the city that I was living in were going up very
*  carefully.
*  When I got married, the wedding industry was having this incredible year, like the strongest
*  year in a generation.
*  Isn't that pretty normal because when you're in a certain stage of life, lots of people are
*  doing these acts same thing?
*  I mean, isn't that very typical?
*  No.
*  So, what I'm talking about here is something a little bit different.
*  I'm not talking about within my friend group, it seemed like everyone was doing the same thing.
*  I'm talking about, in the actual statistics, every one was doing the same thing.
*  I was looking at the entire economy and realizing that I was kind of being the statistical
*  agent.
*  I was the normal person in the economy as I went through it.
*  I realized that's actually because I'm part of this really important cohort of people born
*  in 1990 and 1991 who are turning 33 or 34 this year.
*  We actually represent the biggest part of the biggest generation in the United States.
*  Just say that one more time.
*  That feels like a genuinely new piece of information.
*  I just want you to repeat so I can absorb it.
*  Yes.
*  We are the biggest part of the biggest living generation in America.
*  The people who are born in 1990 and 1991 are the two biggest population years in the
*  country.
*  If you look at it on a chart, you get a little peak right over 1990 and 1991.
*  That means that the millennial generation is sort of skewed towards people who are now
*  in their early 30s.
*  This population group, if you add 1990 and 1991 together, is about 9.5 million people.
*  So a pretty large group of Americans.
*  Fascinating.
*  And what was it about 1990 and 1991 that explains what was in the water, so to speak?
*  These were two really big earth years.
*  A lot of babies were born in 1990 and 1991 in the United States partially because some
*  of these folks are the children of the big years of the baby boom.
*  It was also more than just birth.
*  We had quite a bit of immigration that added to this generation.
*  Both in the 1990s and the 2000s, I think some of the sort of the dream act kids and then
*  also some young adults in the time since have really added to this generation.
*  And so that combination of immigrants and natural population growth has contributed to make
*  these two years really the biggest population years at the moment.
*  So when you had that sensation that when you zigged everyone around you was zicking
*  and when you zagged, everyone around you was zagging, it's because to a certain degree,
*  it's true.
*  This huge part of the population was mimicking what you were doing because there are
*  so many of you.
*  Right.
*  Okay, so stepping back, what does it mean for you and for the economy that this cohort
*  is so large?
*  Well, economics is all about demand and supply, right?
*  And so what this has meant for the cohort, which I call peak millennials, you can use
*  whichever word you prefer, is that at every stage of our economic lives, we've created
*  a lot of demand, which the economy has then had to try to keep up with.
*  The metaphor that I use, which our colleague and your frequent guest Ben Castleman helped
*  me come up with, is that this group of people, you know, my generation, that move through
*  the economy, sort of like a person squeezing into a too small sweater.
*  And what does it look like to try as a cohort to squeeze into a sweater that is too small?
*  It means that, you know, right at the outset, it's a little bit uncomfortable because you're
*  kind of stretching this sweater out as you get it on.
*  And then it means that eventually you leave the sweater a little bit stretched out, a
*  little bit flabby.
*  And so the reason that I got interested in this as it relates to millennials is that we're
*  sort of at this critical juncture and squeezing this sweater on.
*  These folks are now in the age range where they're making really big economic decisions,
*  whether that's buying a house or having kids.
*  Right.
*  And that's really important for the peak millennials, obviously.
*  But because they're such a big generation or such a big sub-generation, it's also potentially
*  pretty influential for the broader United States economy.
*  So, I think to really understand what you're talking about, it would help us to understand
*  what the impact on the economy has been so far as peak millennials have tried to fit into
*  this metaphorical sweater.
*  So where do you think we should start?
*  You know, I think there are probably three areas where we can see this most clearly.
*  I think the first one in a good place to start is college, the second is the labor market,
*  and then the third is housing.
*  So, let's start with people in the olds entering college.
*  So when my cohort went off to college, we really stretched the existing system.
*  So rewind, this is 2008 and 2009.
*  The rate recession is just hit, so unemployment is shooting up.
*  And we're seeing even older people shelter in colleges and universities to sort of wait
*  out that recession.
*  At the same time, these peak millennials are coming in and we're this huge generation
*  of people.
*  And so between all of that population and the fact that people are enrolling in college
*  anyway, enrollment just shoots up.
*  Institutions that had previously been able to welcome anybody, needed to start turning
*  applicants away.
*  You get stories about colleges expanding in this period.
*  And so just in general, the system is really sort of trying to accept all of these very
*  many applicants.
*  Then, this generation graduates.
*  And in recent years, you've actually seen schools starting to close or merge because
*  they're no longer serving this massive cohort.
*  In some places, that's because there's been this cultural shift away from college.
*  But in many places, it's also about demographics.
*  So peak millennials are such an enormous force in higher education in this period that higher
*  education literally expands in some cases and then contracts when peak millennials finish
*  moving through them.
*  They absolutely contribute to that trend.
*  And then they also have this really interesting impact when it comes to student debt.
*  So again, rewind to 2008-2009, the job market's not great.
*  People are going back to school or staying in school longer.
*  And this is also the era of for-profit colleges, which took in a lot of students and left them
*  with sort of sometimes dubious credentials, but a lot of student loans.
*  And what all of this means taken together is that a very big number of people in this
*  very big age group end up taking out student debt.
*  And student debt actually surpasses credit card debt as the biggest source of debt outside
*  of mortgages during the years that this micro generation is in college.
*  So a refuge from about economy doesn't feel like a refuge for a lot of peak millennials
*  because they're accumulating so much debt.
*  And what I guess you're about to tell me is that because they're entering the economy
*  in the middle of the great recession, the job market is also pretty tricky.
*  Right.
*  So the people who don't finish college enter into a very difficult labor market sort of
*  in the depths of the great recession.
*  The people who do finish college and graduate in say 2012 or 2013 or somewhere in that
*  neighborhood are still graduating into a pretty historically weak labor market because as
*  you probably remember Michael, it was a very long drawn out recovery from that very deep
*  recession.
*  And so what we get is the era of baristas with bachelor degrees.
*  You know, everybody is talking about the fact that employers are sort of have their pick
*  of the letter when it comes to entry level employees.
*  Which they do based on the scale of peak millennials, right?
*  Yeah, there are a ton of them and the job market is weak.
*  And so there really is a very tough entry into the labor market for these people, one that
*  is probably at least at the margin exacerbated by just how big the cohort of people is.
*  And so what we see when we look back on this era is that some millennials and particularly
*  those who hadn't finished their college degrees found that they were earning less than
*  previous groups had at the same age right when they entered the labor market.
*  We also see that because student debt had shot up so much that student debt to starting
*  salary as sort of a ratio really shot up during this period, which meant that it could be
*  harder for these folks to build wealth.
*  Right.
*  They're earning less.
*  They owe more thus their ability to do big financial things is just going to suffer,
*  which I think of course brings us to housing.
*  Right.
*  So we've been steadily seeing this uptick in the agent which people start to get into
*  the housing market to cite a statistic that I think illustrates this.
*  The median age of first time home buyers has climbed from something like 31 in 2013 to
*  about 35 in 2023.
*  Wow.
*  So it's just really been moving up over this period.
*  Four years.
*  That's a big leap in what should be an average that is very hard to move.
*  Yes.
*  And part of this is again bad timing.
*  A lot of these peak millennials were coming into our 30s sort of in the wake of the pandemic.
*  You know, at a time when housing prices climbed really, really rapidly and then interest rates
*  starting in 2022 began to really take off.
*  And so that combination of much higher interest rates and very high home prices has meant
*  the affordability has just been really difficult at the exact moment that the peak of the
*  millennial generation began to look to buy.
*  Okay.
*  So in short, the story that you are telling here about this cohort, your cohort is that
*  at the exact moment where they need or want something in this economy, a college degree,
*  a first job, a house, and when it financially speaking should make sense for them to want
*  it and get it, the sheer scale of the cohort combined with some very powerful external economic
*  forces like the Great Recession or a housing crunch, high interest rates means that demand
*  becomes so great that the thing this cohort wants becomes incredibly hard to get.
*  That is the unique burden of being part of this peak millennial group.
*  You all are essentially crowding each other out.
*  Yes.
*  So a lot of this is timing, obviously, but it does seem that at least on the margin, it
*  can be that we eat each other's economic lunch.
*  And what that means is we've seen these big delays among this cohort and making big decisions
*  as compared to generations they came before.
*  And so when people joke that we millennial is complaining a lot, who would joke that?
*  People do.
*  People do, Michael.
*  And the reality is that the complaining reflects something real.
*  So many people in this age group feel that at every turn of our economic lives, our generation
*  has been behind.
*  And now we're playing catch up.
*  We'll do it back.
*  So, you know, I want to understand the long-term implications of this demographic reality that
*  you have been describing.
*  What is it going to mean for peak millennials and for the rest of the economy that your cohort
*  is in the middle of this fierce battle for resources and have been so delayed in so
*  many economic areas of life?
*  So I think there are a few ways to think about this, but I actually over the course of
*  my reporting met this man who is in a stage group, he's 33.
*  And I think he's kind of this perfect encapsulation of some of the trends that we're talking about
*  here and some of the consequences that result from them.
*  Okay.
*  So his name is Thomas Stiller.
*  He grew up in Erie, Pennsylvania, and a pretty middle-class family.
*  His dad was a teacher and his mom was a nurse.
*  And as he's moved through adulthood, he struggled to achieve that middle-class lifestyle himself.
*  He's got a master's degree in medical social work, but he also has student loans as a result
*  of that, and that's left him sort of struggling financially to pay that off and save money.
*  So he currently works two jobs, and at one point he even took on a third at a one-piece drive
*  through.
*  And still, you know, he and his wife are struggling to buy up a house, they're struggling
*  to move somewhere before they start a family.
*  And so they've really had to push back the timeline a little bit.
*  And it's meant that their dreams of, you know, buying a house and then eventually having
*  kids are basically on hold for now.
*  Which is a very vivid consequence and a very vivid long-term consequence of these delays.
*  How typical is that of peak millennials that this set of economic delays you have been describing
*  lead to a decision not to have a family?
*  Yeah, what we have very clearly seen is that fertility trends have been very low for the generation.
*  You know, we have not had a lot of childbearing among millennial women and sort of the age at
*  first childbirth has been going steadily up.
*  And so I think there's a question of whether that's going to change, but for now what we've
*  seen is not a lot of childbearing among this group.
*  And talk to us about why that is going to matter in the broader economy.
*  So it matters for a whole bunch of reasons.
*  You know, when there are fewer children, there are fewer people in the economy, which obviously
*  affects the size of the economy just in a very mathematical way.
*  You know, kids involve a lot of spending, people in general involve a lot of spending,
*  they add to grow.
*  And then I think later on, they're really serious potential consequences because this will
*  impact what the retirement system looks like for all of us.
*  Fewer kids today means fewer adults in a few decades paying into the social security
*  system, which means that we are obviously going to have a lot of peak millennials who
*  are retiring at a time when there are fewer people to sort of pay it to the system that
*  will fund that retirement.
*  Right.
*  So the reality of peak millennials delaying having kids is a genuine financial strain on the
*  government, especially its cherished safety net for retirees.
*  Absolutely.
*  Okay.
*  So how else should we be thinking about the long term impacts of all of this?
*  So there is research from back when the baby boomers were the biggest generation into
*  how being such a large generation can affect long term economic health.
*  So we know from the late boomers, so the people who were born in the late 1950s and early
*  1960s, that really big sub generation, that people who entered the labor market in that
*  generation who joined sort of a weak job market and then had a lot of competition experience
*  in pretty bad long term consequences from that.
*  We saw them have a lot of financial strain.
*  We saw them having elevated levels of homelessness and those problems really followed them for
*  a number of years after they entered the job market.
*  And I asked a lot of economists about this.
*  I said, you know, are these baby boomers, are these late boomers, the prototype for millennials?
*  And I think this is the one place in this story where we actually run into self-relining,
*  which is that economists and demographers told me that the millennials are probably better
*  off than those late baby boomers.
*  Because while the generations are actually kind of similar in size, millennials are actually
*  a little bit bigger, what you see is that those boomers represented a huge jump in size
*  relative to the generation that had come just before, whereas millennials represent a jump
*  in size relative to the generation just before, but not as big of a jump.
*  And so it's that differential that matters.
*  It's how much the sweater has to stretch relative to how big it is.
*  You know, in the boomers case, it went from being an extra small fitting onto a giant.
*  And in the millennials case, it went from being an extra large and had to fit onto a giant.
*  And so I think that that size differential has been really, really important.
*  And so what economists will tell you is that there are some reasons to hope that while
*  millennials are clearly doing things later, while there has obviously been financial strain
*  caused by sort of timing, also potentially generational size, millennials might end up
*  okay in the end.
*  You know, we are seeing these folks managed to build wealth.
*  You know, it's taken them a while, but in recent years, we've seen them really start to
*  mass wealth and stocks, wealth and retirement accounts.
*  We're seeing them have very low unemployment rates.
*  You know, there are signs that these folks are finally finding their footing in the labor
*  market and in the economy as a whole.
*  So I think, you know, again, it bears reiterating that this generation has been very delayed
*  in a lot of economic developments, but the late is not necessarily entirely derailed.
*  Right.
*  But in the meantime, this cohort will still be delayed in marching through the economy
*  and as it uncomfortably stretches out the sweater, the metaphor we've been beating to death
*  in this episode.
*  And I wonder what that's going to mean for the rest of us, those of us not in peak millennial
*  or perhaps even at all, millennial generation.
*  You know, in some ways there are positives here.
*  In the labor market, for example, the latter part of Gen Z may actually benefit from having
*  such a comparatively small graduating class.
*  So when they get to the point that they're replacing these millennials, this very big generation,
*  they'll actually be coming into a situation where the sweater is a little bit roomier than
*  it previously was and so they could actually benefit in the labor market from that.
*  The people coming up behind peak millennials are going to have more opportunity because
*  peak millennials were so big.
*  A couple of economists suggested that to me.
*  Yeah.
*  I think there's also another really big negative one for that demographic though, which is
*  that they're going to be competing with millennials in the housing market.
*  So just given the sheer generational numbers, we know that these folks, these millennials
*  and particular, the peak millennials are going to be competing for entry-level homes for
*  pretty much years to come.
*  And so I think what we see from analyses, from economists and from the government is the
*  demand for entry-level single-family homes is likely to remain really high for basically
*  the rest of the decade as a result.
*  So a lot of competition in the housing market.
*  And then, as with all things, I think there's probably a political dimension to this.
*  I talked to a lot of people anecdotally for this story.
*  It wasn't just a data reporting project.
*  And when you talk to people in this generation, you will often hear that they feel a little
*  bit disillusioned by how this has played out.
*  They don't feel great about the fact that they are struggling to hit some of those financial
*  and economic milestones that people in our parents' generation, for example, hit at much
*  earlier stages or earlier years.
*  And so to return to the man that I quoted earlier, Thomas Stiller from Pennsylvania, he was
*  telling me that he just feels like something has gone wrong and he actually told me that
*  he blames capitalism.
*  He feels like we're in the system where wealth and the means of obtaining it have become
*  really concentrated in few hands.
*  And he was telling me that he's actually always been a Democrat, but he just doesn't even
*  know that he can vote for anyone in this election.
*  And there's this real sense of disillusionment.
*  And so I think there's both the practical consequences, but then also these less economic,
*  but more sociological potential points to fall out from the size of this generation.
*  Right.
*  What you just said very much drives with polling we've seen over the past few months from
*  the times and elsewhere showing that younger Americans are drifting away, especially from
*  President Biden because they don't think the system is working.
*  And it seems like this fellow you talked to very much reinforces that through his own
*  very frustrating experiences in the economy.
*  Yeah, I think that's the case.
*  And I think it was really interesting to me while reporting this story to hear some of
*  those frustrations echoed over and over again.
*  So Gina, this of course all started with you wanting to better understand your own demographic.
*  You are peculineal.
*  So now that you've done all this reporting, talk to all these people, how are you thinking
*  about what it means to be a member of this group?
*  Do you feel like you better understand yourself now?
*  And what is that understanding?
*  You know, I think growing up in this generation, you read so many think pieces about the many
*  things that millennials were accused of killing.
*  And I think you watched a lot of TV segments about how we weren't buying houses because
*  we were busy eating avocado toast.
*  And I think a lot of the tone was that there was maybe something wrong with us, you know,
*  that we had somehow gone awry or made some bad choices and that that was having an after-effect
*  in our economic lives.
*  And I think that sort of all of that fear, satention and all of that focus on this generation
*  happened because of our sheer size and also the timing with which we hit these really
*  important junctures in the economy where we sort of exacerbated some challenges that already
*  existed.
*  And so put very simply, I think we kind of are the problem, but it's not our fault.
*  Well Gina, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to nerdy day.
*  This week, John Barnett, a former quality manager at Boeing, who accused the company of engaging
*  in unsafe manufacturing practices on its passenger plans, was found dead with what appeared
*  to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
*  We talked with Barnett, who went by the nickname Swampie in 2019.
*  Boeing was the place.
*  I mean, they were the place to work, you know.
*  Speaking to my colleague, Natalie Kijouf, Barnett recounted how his original pride at being
*  a Boeing worker had turned into disillusionment.
*  And oh my God, it was amazing when I put that Boeing shirt on.
*  How much hiff puffed out.
*  You know, I'd walk into the store around here and they're like, oh, you are for Boeing
*  and that is awesome.
*  And thank y'all so much.
*  And you just mean so much to this area, you know.
*  Wow.
*  And it was just awesome.
*  And it's just...
*  We don't have any more here.
*  Barnett said he felt obligated to become a whistleblower after witnessing what he described
*  as rushed and shoddy work at the Boeing factory in Charleston, South Carolina, where he worked,
*  and he claims that Boeing disputes.
*  I just think it's critically important that the activities going on within Boeing are
*  made aware to the people whose lives could be affected.
*  You know, as a quality manager at Boeing, you're the last line of defense before a defect
*  makes it out to the flying public.
*  That's a huge responsibility.
*  To many, Barnett's accusations, which began in 2017, now seem pressured.
*  Safety problems have plagued Boeing ever since, including the crash of two Boeing 737s in
*  2018 and 2019, and the blowout of a fuselage panel on an Alaska Airlines flight two months
*  ago.
*  Barnett died in Charleston on Saturday.
*  He was scheduled to finish a deposition that day for a lawsuit in which he accused Boeing
*  of retaliating against him for becoming a whistleblower.
