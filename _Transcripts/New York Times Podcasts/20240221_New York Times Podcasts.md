*  From the New York Times, I'm Katrin Benhold, and this is the Daily.
*  Over the past few weeks, a growing sense of alarm across Europe has turned into outright
*  panic over the future of its security.
*  Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from the key eastern town of Avdevka.
*  As Russia is advancing on the battlefield in Ukraine,
*  Congressional inaction has meant that Ukrainian forces were outgunned, they were outmanned,
*  and they were ultimately forced to withdraw.
*  The U.S. Congress has refused to pass billions of dollars in new funding for Ukraine's war effort.
*  NATO was busted until I came along.
*  I said, everybody's going to pay. They said, well, if we don't pay, are you still going to protect us?
*  Donald Trump, the leading Republican presidential candidate, has warned European leaders
*  that if they don't pay, they fair share it towards NATO.
*  No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want.
*  You got to pay.
*  He would encourage Russia to attack them.
*  And...
*  Condemnation is ringing out tonight.
*  After news Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny has died.
*  Russia's loudest voice of internal dissent, Alexei Navalny has died in prison.
*  Make no mistake. Putin is responsible for Navalny's death.
*  Today, my colleague, Steven Erlanger, on Europe's plans to defend itself against Russia
*  without the help of the U.S.
*  It's Wednesday, February 21st.
*  Steve, you are conveniently for the purposes of this conversation at a major conference devoted to the security of Europe,
*  which, for a variety of reasons, is feeling very insecure at the moment.
*  Insecure, because of what Donald Trump just said,
*  and because Russia seems to be defeating Ukraine in some key battles.
*  And so, I'm curious what the mood has been at this conference.
*  Well, the mood is a little unmoored and shaky.
*  This is a conference of security people, of officials, diplomats.
*  But in a way, it's like a security analyst tinder.
*  You're always running into all kinds of people,
*  and people who care desperately about what Russia is doing, what Ukraine is doing, what America is doing.
*  And the mood has gotten panicky here.
*  So while we're here, Navalny dies, which shook quite a lot of people.
*  Russia made a serious advance in Ukraine over the weekend.
*  They took a town after many months of fighting called Avdivka,
*  which was an important crossroads town.
*  And one had the feeling that with aid to Ukraine's stuck in Congress,
*  that Avdivka was just the beginning of a Ukrainian pullback.
*  And it's against that backdrop that the comments from Donald Trump are particularly worrying.
*  Donald Trump is like this big shadow over everything.
*  Nobody knows whether he's going to be reelected or not.
*  But what he said about NATO,
*  undermined the whole idea of the alliance,
*  which has kept the peace in Europe since the end of World War II.
*  So people are quite nervous about what he said,
*  and that the transactional, unpredictable Donald Trump
*  who seems to govern from his stomach will somehow put a big hole in the credibility of the alliance,
*  just as Russia is increasing its aggression against Ukraine.
*  And when you say undermining potentially the alliance,
*  you're essentially talking about Article V of the NATO charter.
*  Yes.
*  And Article V is a key part of the founding agreement of NATO in 1949.
*  And it basically says that an attack on one member should be considered an attack on every member.
*  Now countries then have the right to decide how to respond to that attack.
*  But the idea is all for one and one for all.
*  That if a little country's part of NATO is attacked,
*  then all countries of NATO would come to its defense.
*  Okay, so Europe depends on NATO for its security.
*  And NATO depends on the credibility of the Article V guarantee from the US,
*  which Trump is basically undermining.
*  Yes.
*  But then again, we've heard Trump make comments like these before on NATO.
*  I mean, he called NATO obsolete when he was president.
*  So why are these latest remarks making such big waves?
*  Well, the first change from before is there's a war in Europe now,
*  not against a NATO member,
*  but there is a serious land war in Europe by Russia
*  that has invaded a neighboring country.
*  And it has created fear that if Russia succeeds in its efforts in Ukraine,
*  that other former Soviet-blocked countries that are now part of NATO
*  could be next, particularly the Baltic nations.
*  And secondly, there's obviously the prospect that Donald Trump's going to be president again.
*  So this really shakes people up.
*  I mean, Trump certainly isn't the first American president to raise this question
*  of underwhelming European spending on its own defense.
*  And it has been true part of what he said is Europe has been complacent
*  since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
*  Europeans have spent less and less money on defense.
*  And they have relied on the United States to protect them
*  without making a fair contribution to their own security.
*  This was an issue under Republican presidents,
*  under Democratic presidents.
*  Harry Truman first complained about Europeans not spending enough on their militaries.
*  But Trump was certainly the most outspoken
*  and the first issue threats of a kind.
*  It's interesting.
*  So you kind of explained that one reason Trump's comments
*  of costs such a panic here in Europe is that the scenario of a Russian invasion
*  is no longer academic, it's actually happening.
*  And of course, unlike the US, Europe shares a whole continent with Russia,
*  so is arguably feeling that threat and that risk much more.
*  Immediately, how did Europe, given this geography,
*  allow itself to become so strategically dependent on the US?
*  How do we get here?
*  Well, it's a long story, of course.
*  I mean, let's go back to the end of World War II,
*  obviously, on the defeat of Nazi Germany.
*  It became quickly clear that Stalin and the Soviet Union
*  intended to keep the territories in Eastern Europe occupied.
*  And this became a big ideological battle,
*  communism versus democracy.
*  And NATO was set up in 1949.
*  Basically, it was a cliche, but it's really true
*  to keep the Russians out, to keep the Germans down,
*  and to keep the Americans in.
*  Because the United States, after World War I,
*  went home, with some people blame for allowing World War II to actually happen.
*  So this time, the Americans stayed at one point in the early 1950s.
*  The Europeans tried to create their own defense community,
*  but they couldn't really get their act together.
*  And always it was dependent in security terms
*  on the American military power and the American nuclear umbrella.
*  And it seemed to suit everybody just fine.
*  So it is sense that European dependence on America
*  was baked in and even tolerated, if not even wanted,
*  by the Americans in those days.
*  Yes, and that's a very good point, because frankly,
*  it was in the American interest, to be honest,
*  for trade reasons, for alliance reasons,
*  to have a very powerful position inside Europe.
*  And when you combined it with an aggressive Soviet communism,
*  at the time, it seemed to serve everybody's interests,
*  including America's national interest.
*  So this worked for quite a long time.
*  It did, and it kept the peace in Europe,
*  which it really was intended to do.
*  But as the Cold War ends, and the Soviet Union falls apart
*  for its own bad structure, I mean,
*  it was inevitably going to fall apart.
*  Suddenly, the Europeans think,
*  well, the threat of war is over.
*  We can relax.
*  We can have what came to be called the peace dividend.
*  We can stop spending so much money on the military,
*  because the idea of this broken Russia invading
*  the rest of Europe seemed inconceivable.
*  So they stopped making things like tanks,
*  and I take weapons and air defenses,
*  and they really cut way back on the amount of money
*  they were spending.
*  And there was complacency, even when Russia invaded Georgia
*  in 2008, and only six years later, a next Crimea.
*  So even at the same Munich Security Conference two years
*  ago, on the eve of the Russian invasion,
*  there was a strong feeling even among Ukraine's president,
*  Volodymyr Zelensky, that Russia would not invade.
*  Now, the Americans in British thought the Russians would invade,
*  but Ukraine would collapse very quickly.
*  The Germans in French thought Putin wouldn't be so stupid
*  to invade at all, so everyone in a way was wrong.
*  And Ukraine, of course, isn't actually a NATO member.
*  It isn't, and yet Ukraine was a kind of frontier land
*  between Russia and NATO.
*  And once Russia started a war, a real war,
*  it really shook people, and that prompted the Biden administration
*  and the European Union and NATO to get their act together
*  to try to help Ukraine as best they could
*  to resist this Russian invasion.
*  So to some degree, NATO's help to Ukraine was slow,
*  but it began to accelerate,
*  and no one expected the war to go on this long either.
*  And so now we're in a very difficult place
*  where Ukraine is more on the defensive,
*  and NATO countries are running out of stocks
*  because they had lived on the peace divinant,
*  they stopped making munitions, they stopped making missiles.
*  They're using up what they have to give to Ukraine,
*  and there's very little left to give.
*  So in a way, two myths have tumbled
*  with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
*  The first is that Russia does not go to war
*  with European countries, and the second myth is that
*  Europe doesn't need to spend a whole lot on its military.
*  Yes, that's true.
*  And then against this backdrop,
*  we also see the United States publicly rethinking its commitments
*  partly because a new generation in America
*  is becoming a bit more isolationist.
*  American funding for Ukraine has been in political limbo for months,
*  and some people don't think it's actually going to happen.
*  I mean, Donald Trump isn't even president,
*  and there's strong opposition in the Republican Party,
*  which seems devoted to him and to his policies,
*  to anything that would offend him,
*  and he is against more aid to Ukraine.
*  So it has become increasingly important
*  so it has become increasingly clear
*  that the Europeans have to start figuring out
*  how to live in a world where support from the United States
*  is less than it used to be.
*  It isn't automatic, and it may not be there at all.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Steve, Europe is really starting to contend
*  with this idea that they need to prepare for a future
*  where the US steps back from its role
*  as the main guarantor of security on the continent,
*  and this is, of course, happening in the middle of a war.
*  So the most immediate concern, presumably,
*  for the Europeans is how to continue supporting Ukraine.
*  Yes, that's absolutely right,
*  because no one wants Ukraine to fall.
*  No one wants Putin to have a victory,
*  because there's nothing like a victory to grow the appetite,
*  and they don't want Russia to succeed.
*  So the most urgent challenge is that Ukraine
*  is going to have a very difficult year,
*  because it is already rationing its use
*  of artillery shells, especially,
*  and there's very little left to give to them this year.
*  The Europeans, for example, have promised to give Ukraine
*  a million artillery shells, and they have barely come up
*  with half that figure, because the peace dividend
*  meant that Europe stopped ordering this kind of ammunition,
*  which meant companies stopped making it,
*  shut down factories, getting them open again,
*  takes a long time.
*  It takes two or three years to get an ammunition factory going,
*  but the fact is all these efforts should have started
*  two years ago, and they did not.
*  So the cupboards are bare, quite literally,
*  but what would a more strategically independent Europe,
*  a Europe that is responsible for its own security,
*  actually look like?
*  Well, there's always been this vision of a European army,
*  but the plan never gets off the ground,
*  because Europe's not a country to begin with,
*  and to send troops into battle requires political responsibility.
*  So who's going to be the European political leader,
*  who everyone in Europe agrees can order
*  its own citizens into battle,
*  which just seems almost impossible to think through.
*  It's a federation of independent countries,
*  and it will never have that kind of collective military.
*  Right.
*  27 countries trying to agree on one commander-in-chief
*  never going to happen.
*  It's never going to happen.
*  Now there are other ideas for a European NATO,
*  which is an alliance of European countries,
*  maybe with less America, possibly with no America,
*  but would agree much like NATO does now,
*  on the best way to create conventional deterrence for Europe,
*  which could be done with a lot more money being spent,
*  which nobody wants to do,
*  and some more sophisticated arms productions.
*  But the question will always be,
*  how do you replace the American nuclear deterrent?
*  That's a much harder question.
*  So in conventional terms,
*  this European NATO would be an organization
*  where European countries kind of provide
*  the overwhelming majority of the deterrent
*  as in troops and weaponry.
*  Yes, but it would also require Europeans to understand
*  that deterrence matters, that military spending matters,
*  and countries would have to agree to spend probably
*  4% of GDP or more on defense,
*  which is Cold War levels,
*  which politically would be very, very unpopular.
*  But at the same time,
*  the Russian War in Ukraine has created an enormous change,
*  and you have intelligence agencies all over Western Europe,
*  now publicly warning people about a Russian threat
*  that they never did before,
*  and trying to get people to prepare for a change
*  in the way they look at their own security,
*  that more money needs to be spent,
*  not just for other people, but for themselves.
*  So ironically, perhaps Trump and the US Congress,
*  maybe have forced this conversation
*  that the Europeans needed to have for a long time.
*  Yes, I mean, there's nothing like scaring people
*  to get them to do things.
*  Trump, the US Congress, and of course,
*  the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
*  All those things have been important
*  to force Europeans to begin to understand
*  that they need to do more about their own security.
*  So we've spent this episode focusing on Europe
*  and the implications of a less engaged America
*  on the security of Europe,
*  but what about the security of America?
*  Does it make sense for the US to step back
*  from the NATO alliance and from Europe for that matter?
*  I mean, Trump is selling this as something
*  that's an America's interest, but is it?
*  Well, this will be one of the great themes
*  of the American election, I think,
*  because President Biden has argued
*  and has believed for a long time
*  that America benefits from its alliances around the world,
*  not just in Europe, but in Asia, elsewhere,
*  that it has friends, it has trading partners.
*  And Mr. Trump believes that alliances
*  bind the United States, that they reduce America's power
*  to do what it wants to do in its own national interest.
*  So these are issues that actually Americans
*  will have to decide upon where American interests lie
*  and the value of alliances.
*  You know, Steve, as we've been talking,
*  it actually sort of took me back to growing up in Germany
*  in the kind of final years of the Cold War,
*  when war with Russia was still a thing
*  that people worried about.
*  So in some ways, the front lines of this new conflict
*  seem very familiar.
*  They do seem familiar and they seem familiar
*  in a very depressing way.
*  What you have is a Russia that clearly has decided
*  that it doesn't want to stay in the boundaries
*  that were left after its defeat in the Cold War.
*  So it's a dangerous time.
*  And we're also in a world that is much less clear
*  than it was during the Cold War.
*  You have the rise of China, you have Iran being
*  almost a nuclear state.
*  You have disorder, lots of places.
*  It's not a neat world.
*  It's a confusing world.
*  And in the face of all that,
*  there is the real possibility that the United States
*  is retreating.
*  Steve, thank you for coming on the show.
*  Thank you.
*  Tomorrow on the daily, we'll look at the life and legacy
*  of Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader
*  and Putin critic who died last week in prison.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Tuesday, the United States vetoed a United Nations
*  Security Council resolution calling
*  for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
*  It is the third time that Washington has blocked an effort
*  by the UN to put an immediate end to the fighting.
*  The US is drafting its own rival resolution
*  that calls for a temporary humanitarian ceasefire,
*  quote, as soon as practical.
*  And days before a Republican presidential primary
*  on her home turf in South Carolina,
*  Nikki Haley fought back against growing calls for her
*  to drop out of the race and endorse the front runner
*  former president Donald Trump.
*  I feel no need to kiss the ring.
*  Haley said that unlike so many fellow Republicans,
*  she was not afraid of Trump's anger or retribution
*  and would remain in the race regardless of what happened.
*  And the South Carolina primary.
*  South Carolina will vote on Saturday.
*  But on Sunday, I'll still be running for president.
