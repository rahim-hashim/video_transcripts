# What Happens if America Turns Its Back on Its Allies in Europe
**New York Times Podcasts:** [February 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drQm7KoJLbk)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Katrin Benholt. And this is The Daily.
*  Over the past few weeks, a growing sense of alarm across Europe has turned into outright
*  panic over the future of its security.
*  Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from the key eastern town of Avdivka.
*  As Russia is advancing on the battlefield in Ukraine,
*  Congressional inaction has meant that Ukrainian forces were outgunned, they were outmanned,
*  and they were ultimately forced to withdraw.
*  The U.S. Congress has refused to pass billions of dollars in new funding for Ukraine's war effort.
*  NATO was busted until I came along. I said, everybody's going to pay. They said, well,
*  if we don't pay, are you still going to protect us?
*  Donald Trump, the leading Republican presidential candidate, has warned European leaders that
*  if they don't pay, they fair share towards NATO.
*  No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want.
*  You got to pay. You got to pay.
*  He would encourage Russia to attack them. And…
*  Condemnation is ringing out tonight. After news, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has died.
*  Russia's loudest voice of internal dissent, Alexei Navalny, has died in prison.
*  Make no mistake, Putin is responsible for Navalny's death.
*  Today, my colleague Stephen Erlanger on Europe's plans to defend itself against Russia without the help of the U.S.
*  It's Wednesday, February 21st.
*  Steve, you are, conveniently for the purposes of this conversation, at a major conference devoted
*  to the security of Europe, which for a variety of reasons is feeling very insecure at the moment.
*  Insecure because of what Donald Trump just said, and because Russia seems to be defeating Ukraine
*  in some key battles. And so, I'm curious what the mood has been at this conference.
*  Well, the mood is a little unmoored and shaky. This is a conference of security people,
*  of officials, diplomats, but in a way, it's like a security analyst Tinder.
*  You're always running into all kinds of people, and people who care desperately about what Russia's
*  doing, what Ukraine's doing, what America's doing. And the mood has gotten panicky here.
*  So, while we're here, Navalny dies, which shook quite a lot of people.
*  Russia made a serious advance in Ukraine over the weekend. They took a town after many months
*  of fighting called Avdivka, which was an important crossroads town. And one had the feeling
*  that with aid to Ukraine stuck in Congress, that Avdivka was just the beginning of the Ukrainian
*  pullback. And it's against that backdrop that the comments from Donald Trump are particularly
*  worrying. Donald Trump is like this big shadow over everything. Nobody knows whether he's going
*  to be reelected or not. But what he said about NATO undermined the whole idea of the alliance,
*  which has kept the peace in Europe since the end of World War II. So, people are quite nervous
*  about what he said, and that the transactional, unpredictable Donald Trump, who seems to govern
*  from his stomach, will somehow put a big hole in the credibility of the alliance,
*  just as Russia is increasing its aggression against Ukraine.
*  And when you say undermining potentially the alliance, you're essentially talking about
*  Article 5 of the NATO Charter. Yes. And Article 5 is a key part of the founding agreement of NATO,
*  1949. And it basically says that an attack on one member should be considered an attack on every
*  member. Now, countries then have the right to decide how to respond to that attack. But the
*  idea is all for one and one for all, that if a little country that's part of NATO is attacked,
*  then all countries of NATO would come to its defense. Okay, so Europe depends on NATO for its
*  security. And NATO depends on the credibility of the Article 5 guarantee from the US, which Trump
*  is basically undermining. Yes. But then again, we've heard Trump make comments like these before
*  on NATO. I mean, he called NATO obsolete when he was president. So why are these latest remarks
*  making such big waves? Well, the first change from before is there's a war in Europe now,
*  not against a NATO member. But there is a serious land war in Europe by Russia that has invaded
*  a neighboring country. And it has created fear that if Russia succeeds in its efforts in Ukraine,
*  that other former Soviet bloc countries that are now part of NATO could be next, particularly
*  the Baltic nations. And secondly, there's obviously the prospect that Donald Trump's
*  going to be president again. So this really shakes people up. I mean, Trump certainly isn't the first
*  American president to raise this question of underwhelming European spending on its own defense.
*  And it has been true. Part of what he said is Europe has been complacent. Since the collapse
*  of the Soviet Union, Europeans have spent less and less money on defense. And they have relied
*  on the United States to protect them without making a fair contribution to their own security.
*  This was an issue under Republican presidents, under Democratic presidents. Harry Truman first
*  complained about Europeans not spending enough on their militaries. But Trump was certainly the
*  most outspoken and the first to issue threats of a kind. It's interesting. So you kind of explained
*  that one reason Trump's comments have caused such a panic here in Europe is that the scenario of a
*  Russian invasion is no longer academic. It's actually happening. And of course, unlike the
*  US, Europe shares a whole continent with Russia, so is arguably feeling that threat and that risk
*  much more. Immediately, how did Europe, given this geography, allow itself to become so strategically
*  dependent on the US? How did we get here? Well, it's a long story, of course. I mean,
*  let's go back to the end of World War II, obviously, and the defeat of Nazi Germany.
*  It became quickly clear that Stalin and the Soviet Union intended to keep the territories
*  in Eastern Europe occupied. And this became a big ideological battle, communism versus democracy.
*  And NATO was set up in 1949. Basically, there's a cliche, but it's really true to keep the Russians
*  out, to keep the Germans down, and to keep the Americans in. Because the United States, after
*  World War I, went home, which some people blame for allowing World War II to actually happen.
*  So this time, the Americans stayed. At one point in the early 1950s, the Europeans tried to create
*  their own defense community, but they couldn't really get their act together. And always it was
*  dependent in security terms on the American military power and the American nuclear umbrella.
*  And it seemed to suit everybody just fine. So in a sense, that European dependence on America
*  was baked in and even tolerated, if not even wanted by the Americans in those days. Yes. And
*  that's a very good point, because frankly, it was in the American interest, to be honest,
*  for trade reasons, for alliance reasons, to have a very powerful position inside Europe.
*  And when you combined it with an aggressive Soviet communism at the time,
*  it seemed to serve everybody's interests, including America's national interest.
*  So this worked for quite a long time.
*  It did. And it kept the peace in Europe, which it really was intended to do. But as the Cold War
*  ends, and the Soviet Union falls apart for its own bad structure, I mean, it was inevitably going
*  to fall apart. Suddenly, the Europeans think, well, the threat of war is over. We can relax.
*  We can have what came to be called the peace dividend. We can stop spending so much money
*  on the military because the idea of this broken Russia invading the rest of Europe seemed
*  inconceivable. So they stopped making things like tanks and anti-tank weapons and air defenses.
*  And they really cut way back on the amount of money they were spending. And there was complacency,
*  even when Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, and only six years later, the next Crimea.
*  So even at the same Munich security conference two years ago, on the eve of the Russian invasion,
*  there was a strong feeling even among Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, that Russia would
*  not invade. Now, the Americans and British thought the Russians would invade, but Ukraine would
*  collapse very quickly. The Germans and French thought Putin wouldn't be so stupid to invade
*  at all. So everyone, in a way, was wrong. And Ukraine, of course, isn't actually a NATO member.
*  It isn't. And yet, Ukraine was a kind of frontier land between Russia and NATO. And once Russia
*  started a war, a real war, it really shook people. And that prompted the Biden administration and the
*  European Union and NATO to get their act together to try to help Ukraine as best they could to
*  resist this Russian invasion. So to some degree, NATO's help to Ukraine was slow, but it began to
*  accelerate. And no one expected the war to go on this long either. And so now we're in a very
*  difficult place where Ukraine is more on the defensive and NATO countries are running out
*  of stocks because they had lived on the peace dividend. They stopped making munitions. They
*  stopped making missiles. They're using up what they have to give to Ukraine, and there's very
*  little left to give. So in a way, two myths have tumbled with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
*  The first is that Russia does not go to war with European countries.
*  And the second myth is that Europe doesn't need to spend a whole lot on its military.
*  Yes, that's true. And then, against this backdrop, we also see the United States publicly
*  rethinking its commitments, partly because a new generation in America is becoming a bit more
*  isolationist. American funding for Ukraine has been in political limbo for months,
*  and some people don't think it's actually going to happen. I mean, Donald Trump isn't even president,
*  and there's strong opposition in the Republican Party, which seems devoted to him and to his
*  policies, to anything that would offend him, and he is against more aid to Ukraine. So it has become
*  increasingly clear that the Europeans have to start figuring out how to live in a world where
*  support from the United States is less than it used to be. It isn't automatic, and it may not be
*  there at all. We'll be right back.
*  So, Steve, Europe is really starting to contend with this idea that they need to prepare for a
*  future where the US steps back from its role as the main guarantor of security on the continent,
*  and this is, of course, happening in the middle of a war. So the most immediate concern, presumably,
*  for the Europeans is how to continue supporting Ukraine. Yes, that's absolutely right, because no
*  one wants Ukraine to fall. No one wants Putin to have a victory, because there's nothing like a
*  victory to grow the appetite, and they don't want Russia to succeed. So the most urgent challenge is
*  that Ukraine is going to have a very difficult year, because it is already rationing its use of
*  artillery shells, especially, and there's very little left to give to them this year.
*  The Europeans, for example, have promised to give Ukraine a million artillery shells, and they have
*  barely come up with half that figure, because the peace dividend meant that Europe stopped ordering
*  this kind of ammunition, which meant companies stopped making it, shut down factories,
*  getting them open again takes a long time. It takes two or three years to get an ammunition
*  factory going, but the fact is all these efforts should have started two years ago, and they did not.
*  So the cupboards are bare, quite literally, but what would a more strategically independent Europe,
*  a Europe that sort of is responsible for its own security, actually look like? Well, there's always
*  been this vision of a European army, but the plan never gets off the ground, because Europe's not a
*  country to begin with, and to send troops into battle requires political responsibility. So who's
*  going to be the European political leader who everyone in Europe agrees can order its own citizens
*  into battle? It just seems almost impossible to think through. It's a federation of independent
*  countries, and it will never have that kind of collective military. Right, 27 countries trying
*  to agree on one commander in chief, never going to happen. It's never going to happen. Now, there are
*  other ideas for a European NATO, which is an alliance of European countries, maybe with less
*  America, possibly with no America, that would agree much like NATO does now on the best way to create
*  conventional deterrence for Europe, which could be done with a lot more money being spent, which
*  nobody wants to do, and some more sophisticated arms productions. But the question will always be,
*  how do you replace the American nuclear deterrent? That's a much harder question.
*  So in conventional terms, this European NATO would be an organization where European countries
*  kind of provide the overwhelming majority of the deterrent, as in troops and weaponry?
*  Yes, but it would also require Europeans to understand that deterrence matters,
*  that military spending matters, and countries would have to agree to spend probably 4% of GDP
*  or more on defense, which is Cold War levels, which politically would be very, very unpopular.
*  But at the same time, the Russian war in Ukraine has created an enormous change, and you have
*  intelligence agencies all over Western Europe now publicly warning people about a Russian threat
*  that they never did before, and trying to get people to prepare for a change in the way they
*  look at their own security, that more money needs to be spent not just for other people,
*  but for themselves. So ironically, perhaps, Trump and the US Congress maybe have forced this
*  conversation that the Europeans needed to have for a long time. Yes, I mean, there's nothing like
*  scaring people to get them to do things. Trump, the US Congress, and of course, the Russian invasion
*  of Ukraine. All those things have been important to force Europeans to begin to understand
*  that they need to do more about their own security. So we've spent this episode focusing
*  on Europe and the implications of a less engaged America on the security of Europe. But what about
*  the security of America? Does it make sense for the US to step back from the NATO alliance and
*  from Europe for that matter? I mean, Trump is selling this as something that's in America's
*  interest. But is it? Well, this will be one of the great themes of the American election, I think,
*  because President Biden has argued and has believed for a long time that America benefits
*  from its alliances around the world, not just in Europe, but in Asia, elsewhere, that it has
*  friends, that it has trading partners. And Mr. Trump believes that alliances bind the United States
*  that they reduce America's power to do what it wants to do in its own national interest.
*  So these are issues that actually Americans will have to decide upon,
*  where American interests lie and the value of alliances.
*  You know, Steve, as we've been talking, it actually sort of took me back to growing up in Germany
*  in the kind of final years of the Cold War, when war with Russia was still a thing that people
*  worried about. So in some ways, the front lines of this new conflict seem very familiar.
*  They do seem familiar, and they seem familiar in a very depressing way. What you have is a Russia
*  that's clearly has decided that it doesn't want to stay in the boundaries that were left after its
*  defeat in the Cold War. So it's a dangerous time. And we're also in a world that is much less clear
*  than it was during the Cold War. You have the rise of China, you have Iran being almost a nuclear
*  state, you have disorder, lots of places. It's not a neat world. It's a confusing world. And in the
*  face of all that, there is the real possibility that the United States is retreating. Steve,
*  thank you for coming on the show. Thank you.
*  Tomorrow on The Daily, we'll look at the life and legacy of Alexei Navalny,
*  the Russian opposition leader and Putin critic who died last week in prison. We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. On Tuesday, the United States vetoed a United Nations
*  Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. It is the third time that
*  Washington has blocked an effort by the UN to put an immediate end to the fighting. The US is drafting
*  its own rival resolution that calls for a temporary humanitarian ceasefire, quote,
*  as soon as practical. And days before a Republican presidential primary on her home turf in South
*  Carolina, Nikki Haley fought back against growing calls for her to drop out of the race and endorse
*  the front runner, former President Donald Trump. I feel no need to kiss the rain. Haley said that
*  unlike so many fellow Republicans, she was not afraid of Trump's anger or retribution
*  and would remain in the race regardless of what happens in the South Carolina primary.
*  South Carolina will vote on Saturday, but on Sunday, I'll still be running for president.
