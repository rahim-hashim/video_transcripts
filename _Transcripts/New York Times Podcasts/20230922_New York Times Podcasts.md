*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverny-Sea, and this is the Daily.
*  As the epidemic of fentanyl use in America continues unabated, causing tens of thousands
*  of deaths per year.
*  Lawmakers and law enforcement agencies are holding one group increasingly responsible.
*  They are the ones who are the most important users themselves.
*  Today, my colleague Eli Saslo, on a man whose friendship ended in tragedy, and a new set
*  of laws that say he is the one to blame.
*  It's Friday, September 22.
*  Eli, welcome to the show.
*  Thanks so much, Sabrina.
*  Before we start, I want you to tell me a little bit about what you do.
*  So I've been an admirer of your writing for a very long time, but I'm curious how you
*  would define your beat.
*  Well, first of all, that's so nice.
*  Thank you.
*  I write about the big issues in the country, the big tension points, but I do it through
*  really personal, intimate, human stories.
*  I try to think about who are the people in this swirl of the big tensions in our country?
*  How can I find them?
*  How can I find them at a moment of uncertainty?
*  Right now, one of the biggest issues in our country is fentanyl.
*  It's become a massive public health crisis.
*  One of the biggest that we have, it's killing hundreds of people a day.
*  It's ruining not only addicts' lives, but family's lives and entire communities where this
*  is become the dominant issue.
*  This is something I've been looking into for a while.
*  And recently I stumbled into a case in doing this research that really kind of crystallized
*  for me how complicated this issue is because it's a case that shows the incredibly personal
*  devastation of this drug, but it also shows how difficult the problem is to solve.
*  And tell me about that case.
*  This is a call from NPED4BY, an eminent at Oklahoma, County Jail.
*  But the center of that case is a guy named Josh Askins.
*  Press one to accept all communications from this eminent.
*  I started talking to Josh probably about three months ago.
*  Hey Josh, it's Eli.
*  Hey, New York Times.
*  How are you?
*  I'm doing okay, how are you?
*  I'm good man, we got it to work, we did it.
*  It was challenging to get in touch with him because he was in jail.
*  So first I called his mom, then I called his lawyer, eventually sort of built enough
*  trust with them that they gave my number to Josh and he called me.
*  And Josh and I started talking really regularly on the phone and that's how I really began
*  to learn about who Josh was and what he'd sort of led him to the place where he was then
*  which was in prison.
*  And what did you learn about Josh?
*  I learned that he'd had in many ways I think a pretty typical American childhood.
*  I pretty much grew up in more Oklahoma.
*  I lived there until the end of my eighth grade year.
*  Josh grew up mostly in Oklahoma.
*  There was lots of joy, lots of like playing in Oklahoma with cousins, four wheelers, you
*  know, video games.
*  But there was also a good bit of sadness.
*  His parents' marriage ended very early in his life.
*  His mom was working a lot.
*  He was raised largely by his grandparents.
*  And when Josh was a kid, he told me that he was raped by an older neighbor boy who lived
*  across the street.
*  He was raped.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's something he never really talked about.
*  He couldn't find anybody to confide in.
*  So pretty early in his life, he developed these real feelings of loneliness.
*  So he tried to find different ways to cope.
*  What did that look like?
*  You know, I started smoking pot when I was about 13.
*  And you know, probably daily after I was 15, it looked like starting to drink and starting
*  to smoke weed.
*  Then Josh, when he was a teenager, he was with another friend and they were in a minor
*  car accident.
*  Josh heard his knee.
*  He was prescribed painkillers, opioid painkillers.
*  And he started taking them and realized not only did they take away the knee pain, but
*  they took away a lot of his dissatisfaction, his loneliness.
*  And so when those prescriptions ran out, Josh realized that his grandmother, who he was
*  often staying with, had her own opioid pain prescriptions.
*  And he started taking some of those.
*  I'll just start thinking, you know, I'll just this one time, I'll have a good time this
*  one time.
*  And that'll be, you know, it or just this weekend.
*  At one point in time, I was able to control my usage, but at some point along the way,
*  I lost that control.
*  And I think part of me is always thinking that one day I'll get that control back, but
*  it's not there anymore.
*  And there is one moment that Josh tends to point to when he thinks about how his drug
*  use started to really accelerate.
*  And that's the death of his grandfather.
*  Josh's grandfather was a huge figure in his life.
*  He was maybe the main authority figure and also often Josh's main caretaker.
*  He was sort of his role model.
*  And as Josh's grandfather got sick, Josh was already using some of these pills.
*  The night that he passed away, my grandmother called me over that night.
*  On the night that Josh's grandfather died, they wanted Josh to come over there, but he
*  wasn't in his right mind.
*  I think I'd take it for the sleeping pills.
*  And I got him back in the bed and told him I'll be back over in the morning.
*  A few hours later, my mom called and told me he had passed away.
*  And he wasn't there.
*  He wasn't present for his grandfather in those final moments.
*  I kind of carried that guilt with me for a long while.
*  And I believe that's when my, you know, drug use took it down one spot.
*  It was at that point.
*  And this started just a brutal, decade-long stretch for Josh, where he would sink into
*  awful, active addiction for long stretches.
*  Then he would have other stretches where he would emerge.
*  And he would be clean.
*  He would go through rehab and he'd be back for a year, even two years, before the addiction
*  started again.
*  And so like a lot of drug addicts, Josh was using a lot of things.
*  Heroin was the drug that he used the most.
*  But over the last five years, Heroin, particularly black tar heroin, which is what Josh
*  like to smoke, it started to basically disappear from the drug market in Okone.
*  What's your power?
*  How much money would you have if he was up there?
*  What is your power?
*  My power?
* hamacity, I would work all night long for that.
*  Not only for your own abilities, I'd like to say I intend to knock it all off, I'd
*  think tonight, whenever you've got drugs, I'd do a fight there.
*  That's just a way to interrogate this зим here.
*  And you know, I think, V極, that's a faction of robbery risk.
*  What's your power of Abgeordn Three.
*  Two guys, I think you get what I'm talking about.
*  Buz premise, is why are a gang fight?
*  My bad friends didn't think that they could start a war with that.
*  And then back to Dest crispy, I'd think, shared the feud against they had against
*  any heroin that didn't have fentanyl and so it kind of progressed from there.
*  And tell me what a fentanyl addiction actually looks like.
*  Like from the perspective of someone like Josh who's addicted.
*  It's miserable.
*  I mean, I've spent a lot of time with fentanyl addicts and I don't think I've ever
*  found one who enjoys being addicted to fentanyl.
*  You become dependent on it really quickly.
*  It's up to 40 times more addictive than heroin.
*  It's a really fast acting high, but it's an even faster withdrawal experience.
*  So you can use fentanyl and two hours later, already potentially be going into
*  early withdrawal symptoms where your body is starting to feel sick, where you're sweating,
*  you're feeling nauseous, you have brain fog and that's just getting worse and worse
*  and worse until you use again.
*  So for somebody like Josh and for a lot of people who are addicted to fentanyl on
*  the streets in the United States right now, they are using eight to ten times a day,
*  buying drugs in very small quantities and then using and then sort of feeling okay for
*  a little while and then trying to come up with money to buy again.
*  And that money is often like minuscule.
*  You know, in a lot of places in the United States right now, fentanyl sells for as little
*  as $0.50 to a dollar for a blue pill.
*  You can trade a cigarette for a blue pill of fentanyl.
*  So these are constant transactions of desperation that are happening ten times or more a day
*  for people who are addicted.
*  So your life becomes about finding the drug and even more than a very addictive drug like
*  heroin, it's every two hours.
*  So you need to constantly be going out in search of it to not go into withdrawal.
*  Yeah, you're enslaved to it.
*  That's the reality.
*  You're both psychologically dependent on the drug.
*  It changes your brain chemistry and you're physically dependent because otherwise you're
*  going to get sick and brutally sick.
*  I mean, we're talking about, you know, unmedicated fentanyl withdrawal.
*  Most doctors equate to basically going through an incredibly difficult labor.
*  So these are like violent, painful physical symptoms.
*  Josh would often talk to me about how his main anxiety would be not wanting to go to sleep
*  unless he knew that he had just enough fentanyl left to smoke in the morning because the idea
*  of waking up already in withdrawal and not being able to stave off those symptoms a little
*  bit was too terrifying.
*  He would never be able to sleep unless he knew he had that little amount to wake up to.
*  So what is the rest of Josh's life look like at this point?
*  Oh, it looks so grim.
*  You know, I went to see where Josh was living at his most recent low point and he was inside
*  a sleeping bag in the sort of crawl space of an abandoned house in Oklahoma City.
*  There was a broaded out hole in the porch of this abandoned house and Josh had found
*  a way to crawl in there and get back kind of under the floorboards so that he would be
*  out of the rain.
*  I'm sure there's probably, you know, worst places to be exposed, but yeah, definitely,
*  you know, wasn't fun, but, you know, I didn't, I guess part of me was just too proud of
*  asking for any help or to try and get into one of the nice centers.
*  I'm with they're pretty tough to get into.
*  And it's this torturous place to live and he's trying to spend his little time there as
*  possible, honestly.
*  So he's often walking around the neighborhood and one day in the spring of last year, Josh
*  is walking around and he runs into this guy who lives with his grandmother at a house
*  that happens to be basically right around the corner from the abandoned house where Josh
*  was staying.
*  This guy's name was Chris Drake and meeting him that day really changed the course of
*  Josh's life.
*  He followed me and I went over to him to kind of introduce himself and we just got to
*  talk in and so I went over and hung out at his house and Josh and Chris would start
*  to talk a little bit.
*  At first, Chris was kind of suspicious of Josh.
*  You know, at first, I think he kind of thought, well, this guy gone to steal some stuff
*  from me just because he's homeless or something and then he realized that, you know, just
*  because I was homeless at that time, doesn't mean that, you know, I'm going to steal your
*  stuff if I get a chance or anything like that.
*  So he can't, he started to come to trust me a little bit, I believe.
*  And what both of them really wanted from each other was just company.
*  They were both lonely and they would sit on the porch and they would have these long
*  conversations about their lives.
*  We talked about, you know, our relationships with our moms growing up.
*  You know, we both had a strong relationship with our grandmothers.
*  We both had a similar faith.
*  Even though we weren't practicing it, obviously at that time.
*  So it turned out they had a lot in common.
*  They both really relied on their faith.
*  They each were reading the Bible for the sixth time, coincidentally.
*  So they talked a lot about how their faith had sort of informed their life and they also
*  talked about their own traumas that they'd been through that they thought had led them
*  to a place of addiction.
*  We were able to confide in each other about no of some things.
*  You know, we both had, you know, stuff happened to us when we were growing up.
*  You know, we were both a less than a young age.
*  So we were able to bond over that as well, you know, and how we had issues trusting
*  in our lives sometimes because of that.
*  Just like Josh, Chris had also been molested and sexually abused when he was a kid.
*  Those were conversations that neither of them felt safe having with very many people.
*  But once they realized that they had each endured a similar thing, they both finally found
*  like they had somebody to talk to about that.
*  And it formed this really intimate bond pretty quickly.
*  I think we both wanted to find loving acceptance from our peers.
*  And we had had difficulty with that in the past.
*  So I think we kind of bond over that.
*  Like until then, Josh didn't really have friends.
*  We had people that he got high with.
*  He had people that were sharing sort of his stage in life and his desperation.
*  But he didn't have people that he was having confessional conversations with.
*  And that was a huge thing for him.
*  We also talked about other things.
*  So we talked about, you know, wanting to get clean and how hard it was.
*  The other thing that Josh and Chris really bonded over was that they both wanted to get
*  clean.
*  And that's, that is not a small thing when you are enslaved to an addiction.
*  It beats you down.
*  It carries you down and people tend to get hopeless.
*  And Chris and Josh were not hopeless.
*  A lot of what they would do together was figure out how can we get better and to be the
*  people that we want to be.
*  So they had started making plans to try to get into a rehab facility that would help them
*  get clean and help get their lives back on track.
*  We had talked about going to Oakwood Springs, which I never meant to that detox before.
*  He had been to it before.
*  He said that he needed to call a step down and step down.
*  Would help us get in there.
*  So the friendship, it sounds like, was based at least on part on this shared trauma, right?
*  And it looked like it was actually starting to make a difference in their lives, like that
*  they might actually find their way out of this addiction.
*  Totally.
*  We know now that a lot of what drives people deeper into addiction is things like loneliness,
*  like disenfranchisement, disassociation.
*  And suddenly these two people found each other both at a vulnerable moment and formed a
*  real connection.
*  So they'd begun calling around trying to get into these different rehab places.
*  They'd finally found one that was going to take them.
*  But before they could get in, their plans got cut short.
*  What happened?
*  Well, I mean, that day, so Josh woke up one morning in April of this year under the abandoned
*  porch.
*  I figured I'd go over and see Chris.
*  So I walked over to his house to see if he was a-
*  And did what he often did, which was walk over to Chris's house.
*  And Josh at that point hadn't used fentanyl yet that day.
*  He was starting to ache.
*  His legs were starting to hurt.
*  He was beginning to feel hot, nauseous.
*  He went over to kill time with Chris on the porch.
*  He asked me if I could get in some fentanyl.
*  And Chris said to Josh, hey, we're not going to be able to get into this rehab place for
*  a few more days.
*  Can we get some fentanyl that might help get us through?
*  He asked me a few times.
*  I was like, and finally I was like, are we, man?
*  You know, let's go.
*  And so the two of them got into Chris's car to go find some fentanyl.
*  So they ended up at this motel where Josh saw somebody that he knew and that he'd bought
*  drugs from before.
*  I gave this person some money and gave it to him.
*  And Josh and Chris combined their money.
*  They had about 25 bucks.
*  They spent all of it.
*  They gave it to him and he gave them back a very small amount of white powder.
*  We had about three tins of a gram.
*  And what's basically a tiny little dime bag.
*  I mean, it looks like a little shake of sugar in a tiny little zip lock bag.
*  But potentially a very potent shake of sugar.
*  Yeah.
*  And Josh and Chris, they put it on a little bit of tin foil while they're in the car.
*  They cook up that tin foil with a lighter.
*  So you light the bottom of the tin foil.
*  The drugs start to smoke a little bit.
*  It's usually like a yellow smoke.
*  And with what's essentially a straw, Chris took the first hit and then passes it over
*  to Josh.
*  Josh takes a hit, passes it back to Chris.
*  Chris takes one more hit.
*  We get to fit in all and we both win under.
*  At this point, they both nod out.
*  That's what fentanyl users call it.
*  This initial moment where you basically feel complete and total relaxation and nothingness.
*  And you essentially borderline lose consciousness.
*  Josh kind of comes to.
*  He looks up, looks around and he looks over at Chris and something doesn't look right.
*  When I did come back, I noticed that his lips were blue and he was not conscious.
*  Chris is bent over awkwardly.
*  His chin is down touching his chest.
*  He's not moving at all.
*  And despite the fog of his own drug use and his own high, he thinks something might really
*  be wrong here with Chris.
*  So he starts tapping him on the shoulder, shaking him.
*  Hey, Chris, wake up.
*  Man, what's going on?
*  And nothing.
*  I'm just coming back from Chris at all.
*  So my first thought was I got to get this guy some help.
*  I was in the driver's seat of the car.
*  So I went ahead and took off, started driving towards the hospital.
*  At this point, to his credit, Josh realizes like an emergency is underway and he needs to
*  get some help.
*  So the hospital is fairly far from where they are.
*  I know if the brain can we survive for four minutes without oxygen.
*  I see his lips are turning blue.
*  I know it's probably been a little bit.
*  Josh knows from his own experience with drugs that you can die of an overdose in less
*  than five minutes.
*  That's how quickly feed all this synthetic fentanyl can be.
*  I need to go ahead and start doing CPR on him that way he's getting oxygen to his brain.
*  So I pulled him to the nearest filling station, pulled him out of the car, started performing
*  CPR and called it as somebody to call 911.
*  So Josh drives to a gas station very nearby where he goes to the attending office.
*  Bangs on the door and says, help call 911.
*  My friend is overdosing and then Josh helps pull his friend out of the passenger seat and
*  wise him flat in the parking lot.
*  And he starts to give his friend CPR, mouth to mouth.
*  Josh had worked for a little while in a nursing home where he'd been required to go to
*  a CPR course.
*  And so he has some idea of how to do this.
*  How long do you think you were given him CPR?
*  Man, it felt like forever.
*  You know, every minute feels like forever.
*  Yeah, I'd say for a good eight minutes.
*  You know, I had holler for, you know, if somebody else could help me, nobody was moving
*  to help me.
*  So I just kept doing, you know, why could?
*  By the time the ambulance pulls up, Josh is physically drained from performing CPR.
*  He's also terrified and emotionally exhausted because he still doesn't know whether or not
*  his friend is alive or dead.
*  So at this point, Josh is called an ambulance.
*  He's frantically trying to save his friend.
*  He's performing CPR.
*  He's standing there.
*  The ambulance arrives.
*  He has done everything in his power to save his friend.
*  Exactly.
*  And the only thing in Josh's head at this point is, is Chris going to make it?
*  Is he okay?
*  That's the question that Josh is asking again and again.
*  First of the paramedics when the ambulance arrives.
*  And then the police come a few minutes later because they've also heard this call.
*  And Josh is standing with them and asking about Chris.
*  Is he going to be okay?
*  How is he doing?
*  What's happening?
*  But slowly over those next minutes, the police start asking him a lot of questions too.
*  And what was your conversation with the police officers like?
*  Well, he had put me in the back of the car and rammed already.
*  And then he said he was calling in to the supervising officers, I'm like that.
*  And so they did that and they told me that they wanted to talk to me about what had happened.
*  They want to know where did the drugs come from?
*  What kind of drugs?
*  Who bought the drugs?
*  Where did the money come from?
*  Was it shared?
*  Who used the drugs first?
*  I definitely knew that I was in some trouble.
*  I would be in some trouble.
*  And you figured maybe you'd get in trouble for buying drugs or for smoking fentanyl yourself?
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  And slowly it started to dawn on Josh that this conversation was different than the one
*  that he expected.
*  They weren't all just talking about how Chris was going to be, but they were beginning
*  to talk about who might be responsible.
*  And this conversation turned into an investigation.
*  I was like, man, y'all gonna arrest me if you are, just tell me.
*  And he nodded over to the other officer and the officer, that's when he grabbed my
*  arms and put my hands behind my back and told me he was arresting me for murder.
*  And just as the ambulance was taking off Chris, who at that point Josh suspected was dead,
*  the officer said to Josh that he was under arrest for murder in the first degree.
*  When he said murder, what was going through your mind?
*  Oh, man, I was so sick and lost stomach because the only penalties for the first-degree
*  murder are life, life without parole or death penalty.
*  You know, those are the only three options you have with a murder charge.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Eli, how did we get to a place where a friend sees that his friend is overdosing, tries
*  to resuscitate him, calls 911, and is charged with a murder at the scene just after a few
*  questions by police?
*  Well, we got here because of an unimaginable amount of death.
*  I mean, fentanyl is killing so many people in the United States in an average of about
*  200 people a day in this country die from fentanyl overdoses, mostly accidental fentanyl
*  overdoses.
*  That's more people than are killed by guns every day.
*  It's more people than die in car accidents every day.
*  And so there's been a massive amount of pressure coming from the country to lawmakers to hold
*  somebody accountable.
*  Our sharp penalties are coming for people caught dealing the dangerous opioid fentanyl.
*  So what's happened over the last year is these lawmakers have taken that pressure and turned
*  it into legislation.
*  Possession of more than a gram of something that contains fentanyl in the state of Colorado
*  is now a felony.
*  Not just in red states, but in blue states, frankly, in most states.
*  And more than 30 states, we've seen new legislation to try to create harsh reponishment
*  for fentanyl dealers and also for fentanyl addicts.
*  The bill designates any substance containing the deadly drug to be considered as a weapon
*  of terrorism.
*  So Virginia, for instance, recently passed the law codifying fentanyl as a weapon of
*  terrorism.
*  The bill will make distributing fentanyl a class for felony, which gives you a sense of
*  how serious it is.
*  Wow.
*  New law takes effect this week targeting the fentanyl crisis here in the Lone Star State.
*  Texas passed a bill that would reclassify fentanyl overdose deaths from being accidents
*  to being poisonings.
*  And that then puts the onus on law enforcement to go out and find who is responsible for
*  those poisonings.
*  Arkansas will charge drug dealers with murder if they deliver drugs that cause an overdose.
*  Arkansas passed a death by delivery bill in April to charge some overdoses as murders
*  in an effort to deter anyone from selling or even just sharing fentanyl.
*  We hope that this bill pushes the justice system to take this seriously.
*  And a lot of this ends up coming down to local prosecutors who now have pretty wide discretion
*  to charge people with murder after someone dies of an overdose.
*  So in other words, a real toughening of the laws against fentanyl using the most stringent
*  charge under the law.
*  Murk.
*  Yeah, that's exactly right.
*  The challenge though is really how to find the people who they want to hold responsible
*  with something like this drug that the supply right now of these chemicals is mostly manufactured
*  in China.
*  Then cartels are producing the drug in Mexico and then its traffic in huge volume into the
*  United States.
*  And eventually it gets to the street and finally to people like Josh.
*  And most of the times the street level transactions are from one addict to another in small, small
*  volume.
*  And those tend to be the people who get caught.
*  So you have situations where the people actually being held responsible, the ones who are being
*  charged with murder are people like a 17 year old in Tennessee who after graduation,
*  her and two of her friends used fentanyl.
*  They all nodded out in the car.
*  One girl survives the other two died and suddenly the 17 year old girl is being charged
*  as an adult with a murder charge.
*  You have a real estate agent in Florida who throws a party at her house, provides some drugs
*  for the guests of her party.
*  One of those people dies.
*  The real estate agent calls 911 and then finds that she herself is arrested for murder.
*  You've got a high schooler who meets a girl in church in Ozark, Missouri.
*  And he says, hey, I've got some fentanyl.
*  She would like some.
*  He gives her a pill.
*  He gives her instructions and says, only take half to it this way.
*  Call me at this moment.
*  She takes the whole pill.
*  She dies.
*  And now the 17 year old kid in Ozark, Missouri is also being charged with murder.
*  So oftentimes you have very small time dealers or really just users who end up being the ones
*  who are caught because they're the easiest people to catch.
*  And that's what happened at Josh.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's the case said that Josh essentially acted as a middleman.
*  He was the one who knew where to get drugs.
*  He was the one who knew the dealer.
*  He was the one who knew how to get there.
*  He procured the drugs and then shared them with his friend, which to them meant that Josh
*  was essentially a dealer.
*  He could be held responsible.
*  So this is really hard, right?
*  You have this raging epidemic.
*  Truly one of the biggest problems our country is facing right now.
*  And the country's desperate to remedy the situation.
*  So a very real problem.
*  But then this arrest for murder, like in Josh's case, doesn't really seem like the right
*  fix.
*  Like it seems like we're overcorrecting.
*  I think it depends on who you ask.
*  A lot of lawmakers in this country have decided that based on their constituents anger
*  and pain and fear around the fentanyl epidemic, the correct fix is to pass the harshest laws
*  possible, which they hope will act as some kind of a deterrent to people who might deal
*  or use fentanyl.
*  But in terms of whether or not this will solve the problem, I think that gets into a much
*  bigger, more existential question about where we are in America.
*  Because what it looks like to solve the addiction crisis right now means keeping people alive
*  when they're addicted and then trying to help them get better.
*  And that means, you know, Narcan and medications to help them get clean and access to rehab,
*  which is a major challenge in this country.
*  And then once they're done with rehab, long term beds and medical care and mental health
*  care so that people aren't discharged, newly cleaned back to tents on the street, surrounded
*  by fentanyl that sells for a dollar a pill.
*  Because that's not a recipe for success.
*  And even bigger than that, it means addressing all of these things that right now, tragically
*  are endemic in American life and on the rise, such as sense of despair, bad health care
*  outcomes, rising, wealth inequality, loneliness, all of these things that we know drive people
*  to addiction in the first place, right?
*  So the answer is to what is the fix are really, really difficult.
*  So at some point, it gets a lot easier and a lot more doable to say, hey, this person
*  provided the drugs in this case, this is the person who's responsible.
*  Let's answer the question this way.
*  Right, this going after the little guy who's very often himself a drug user feels like
*  we're doing something, but it's not doing anything to fix the problem.
*  That's right.
*  I mean, I think Josh is confused at why he gave the name of the drug dealer who sold them
*  the drugs to the police, a guy named Shug and Shug was never found or arrested or held
*  accountable.
*  The only one who's been held accountable is Josh.
*  And what about the families of the victims?
*  I mean, they would appear to be pretty important parties here when we're talking about prosecution,
*  right?
*  Like, who do they think should be held responsible?
*  I think it's really different in every case, right?
*  That's a really personal question about how people grieve.
*  You have parent groups who are saying, you know, our teenagers are being given these
*  pills and are dying at sleepovers.
*  We want whoever to be held accountable and to be held accountable to the full extent of
*  the law.
*  And I can understand why?
*  Like, you want a punishment that meets the absolute magnitude of the loss and the magnitude
*  of the loss is unspeakable.
*  So it's different in every case.
*  For Chris, his family was mostly confused about why Josh had been arrested for murder.
*  Chris's grandmother, when she was told that Josh was being charged for murder, her first
*  reaction was for what?
*  And when the actual circumstances were described to her that they'd shared these drugs, they'd
*  smoke them together, they'd bought them together.
*  She frankly thought, like, this doesn't make any sense.
*  So she doesn't blame Josh at all?
*  No.
*  I mean, if anything, I think she feels some gratitude to Josh first for being a friend
*  to her grandson at a really difficult moment in his life, but mostly for trying to save
*  his life.
*  And how is Josh doing now?
*  One was the last time you guys talked.
*  We're in close touch.
*  You know, Josh has a lot of time.
*  He's lonely.
*  And I always am happy to talk to him.
*  I like talking to him.
*  So we talk every few days.
*  I mean, is your own personal safety an issue in there?
*  Are you worried about that?
*  Not anymore.
*  You know, I was at first, you know, but now people know me.
*  Nobody really charged to press me or take advantage of me anymore.
*  You know, I mean, I also still talk a lot to his mom and to his family.
*  And for his mom, you know, when Josh went to jail, her one solace was that she thought,
*  at least now, he'll be safe.
*  Like, he's not going to be sleeping under the abandoned porch.
*  He's not going to be able to use fentanyl all the time.
*  He's not going to overdose.
*  But what actually is true, surprising to her and to me is that there is fentanyl all
*  over the jail.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  They warned me coming in.
*  They were like, look, the stuff they got in here is even more potent than the stuff they
*  got on the streets.
*  So don't do it.
*  And on his first days in jail, he started buying some of this fentanyl from other inmates
*  and using it.
*  I was really, really low.
*  You know, I was like, man, my life is over with this time, you know.
*  Using it to escape his own grief over Chris's death, his own pain over his situation.
*  I can't say that I was trying to overdose on purpose.
*  I can't say subconsciously that I wasn't either.
*  And soon after Josh got in jail, he took a mass of the amount of fentanyl and overdosed.
*  So, so your overdose is probably like two or three days after Chris's overdose?
*  Well, actually about four, yeah, about four days after.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's how Josh's time in jail started.
*  He's now been clean from fentanyl for three months.
*  How was, how was work in there today?
*  I was good, you know.
*  He's managed to nurture his faith a little bit in the chapel at the jail, helping other
*  people read the Bible, talking to them about their faith for a few hours a day.
*  The past is up there.
*  They, they like me a lot, you know.
*  And usually on Friday, they'll get me a little lunch and we'll have lunch together and stuff.
*  So that's always nice.
*  So little by little, you know, Josh started to find a routine in there that maybe works
*  for him to get from one day to the next.
*  And then just in this last week, Josh had to make a really difficult decision about how
*  long he's going to be in prison.
*  The prosecutors in this case had looked at it again and had decided that they were willing
*  to reduce the charges and give Josh a chance to plea to first degree manslaughter.
*  The other choice that Josh could have made was to take the case to trial and to put his
*  faith at the whims of a system that right now he doesn't have a lot of faith in.
*  So Josh decided last week to take the plea and he will be in jail for a while because
*  he now has pled guilty to first degree manslaughter.
*  So he's taking responsibility for Chris's death?
*  Yeah, he's taking responsibility for Chris's death, which he doesn't think is the right
*  thing.
*  His lawyer doesn't necessarily believe it's the just thing.
*  But I think what Josh decided was it was the smartest course of action.
*  It gives him a chance to get home, to get back to his mom, to get back to his life much
*  sooner than if he were risking it at a jury trial, which would be a significant gamble.
*  And given the fact that Josh is going to spend a number of years in prison, looking
*  back, would he have done anything differently?
*  That's something that we've talked about a lot.
*  I mean, how often are you thinking about Chris in there and like, have you had a chance
*  to grieve?
*  You've had so much going on yourself.
*  Yeah, you know, I mean, and that comes and goes, you know, like I could be lying to you.
*  You know, he could have done so many things differently.
*  But up until the moment that they use drugs, I think Josh would have done everything differently
*  in his life almost.
*  But from the moment that they both took their first hit of fentanyl, Josh feels like he
*  made the right decisions.
*  I don't think I could have lived with myself if I had chosen anything different.
*  If I hadn't at least tried to do everything I could, you know, to help him, I feel like
*  it would have been a lot heavier burden on my soul that like maybe I could have done
*  something differently.
*  You know, if anything, it would have been to not even get the drugs in the first place.
*  You know, unfortunately, being an active addiction, that's not much of an option for you.
*  He didn't leave the car.
*  He didn't run away.
*  He stayed with his friend.
*  He tried to give him CPR.
*  He got help.
*  He did whatever he could to save his friend's life.
*  And actually, the fact that he did that, even though it's put him in jail, Josh has said
*  to me many times he feels like it's those actions of decency that have a chance to save
*  him.
*  He knows that when the chips were down, he did what he feels like were the right things.
*  And that's an easier way to go about living your life than feeling like you have but a
*  friend die without trying to help them.
*  So his day that's landed him in prison for a long time is actually a day he's really
*  proud of.
*  That's exactly right.
*  I think he thinks it's actually one of the greatest acts of heroism in his life.
*  In a life that he feels really mixed feelings about.
*  He's made a ton of mistakes but helping Chris and trying to save him was not one of those
*  mistakes in Josh's mind.
*  I tried to do everything I could for him and you know, it just kind of felt like it was
*  fetal almost but I spent a lot of years beating myself up from my grandfather dying
*  and thinking that I could have done something differently.
*  And when I did that have an opportunity to help somebody else who is dying and they still
*  died anyways, I feel like almost that was God showing me that was his providence that
*  he, you know, he allowed somebody to live or not live and you know, maybe it was just
*  their time.
*  Yeah.
*  But still it doesn't make it very much easier.
*  Eli, thank you.
*  Thanks so much.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Thursday, media magnate, Rupert Murdock is retiring from the Fox and news corporation
*  boards and making his son, Lacklin, the sole executive in charge of the powerful global
*  media empire that he built from a local newspaper concern in Australia 70 years ago.
*  The move puts his business, which includes the influential 24 hour news and opinion network,
*  the Fox News Channel, more firmly under his son's control, a year ahead of the 2024 presidential
*  election.
*  The Times reports that a succession battle may still loom.
*  Murdock, who is 92, put a plan in place two decades ago that his four adult children would
*  have to work out his ultimate successor among themselves when he dies.
*  And the Biden administration said that it would allow hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans
*  already in the United States, but without legal status, to live and work legally in the
*  country for 18 months.
*  The decision will affect about 472,000 Venezuelans who arrived in the country before July 31,
*  temporarily protecting them from removal and waving a month's long waiting period for
*  them to seek employment authorization.
*  Top New York Democrats had lobbied intensely for the move, arguing that roughly half the
*  migrants currently living in New York City are Venezuelans, and that the city's safety
*  net would tear under their weight unless they were allowed to work and support themselves.
