# The Crypto Comeback
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOjgPhaRUs4)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  FTX founder Sam Bankman Fried was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison.
*  When the influential cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapsed in 2022, it lost billions of
*  dollars in customers' money.
*  The man behind one of the biggest financial frauds in American history.
*  It lost $10 billion of customer deposits, all while living a relatively lavish lifestyle
*  in the Caribbean.
*  Cryptocurrencies have spent the better part of this year in a tailspin fueled by financial
*  losses.
*  But in a surprising twist earlier this month, those customers were told they would get their
*  money back.
*  Today, my colleague David Yaffe Bellamy on what was behind this change in fortune and
*  on what it says about the improbable resurgence of crypto.
*  It's Tuesday, May 21st.
*  David, welcome back to the show.
*  Thanks so much for having me.
*  So the last time we spoke, Sam Bankman Fried, the disgraced founder of the company FTX,
*  and in many ways, you know, the face of the crypto industry, was about to go on trial
*  for stealing money from his customers.
*  And it really looked like that money was never going to come back.
*  Billions of dollars disappeared.
*  But then something surprising happened.
*  Tell us about it.
*  You're right.
*  When FTX collapsed, customers were in total despair.
*  You know, they were convinced they were never going to see this money again.
*  And Sam Bankman Fried was convicted of fraud, stealing this money and sentenced to 25 years
*  in prison.
*  But after the company collapsed, a team of bankruptcy professionals came in.
*  These are people whose specialty is going into collapse companies, figuring out what
*  went wrong and trying to put pieces back together.
*  And over time, they started cobbling together a pool of assets, investments that Sam had
*  made in other companies, cryptocurrencies that he had stashed over the years.
*  And as they did this, they built up a large supply of assets.
*  And what they announced just a few days ago is that not only are they going to be able
*  to repay customers, but they'll be able to repay them in full with interest.
*  Incredible.
*  And this is really a shocking conclusion to this whole saga.
*  And it's in line with a few really surprising things that have happened in the crypto industry
*  over the last year or so since it reached its low point back in November 2022 with FTX's
*  collapse.
*  OK, so let's dig into that.
*  Explain to us how this failed company ended up being able to return billions of dollars
*  How did it do that?
*  So the first thing that's important to understand is where the money went.
*  It wasn't simply vaporized.
*  Sure, you know, some of it was spent on expensive material possessions, but not all of it.
*  Sam put a lot of this money into investments in other startups, investments in cryptocurrencies.
*  And this was stealing.
*  This was money he wasn't supposed to use.
*  It was supposed to be set aside for customers.
*  But some of those investments actually turned out to be really good.
*  So give me an example.
*  What turned out well?
*  One of Sam Bankman Fried's pet issues was artificial intelligence.
*  He was obsessed with AI.
*  He was convinced that it was a potential threat to civilization.
*  And his version of a solution to that problem was to invest in AI companies that were committed
*  to developing the technology responsibly.
*  And so one of the companies that he invested in was called Anthropic.
*  And he put in about $500 million in 2021.
*  Now over the last three years, the AI industry has exploded and companies like Anthropic
*  have become much, much more valuable.
*  And so just in the last few months, those bankruptcy experts who are now running FTX
*  sold off a portion of that stake for close to a billion dollars.
*  So that's a tidy profit on the investment that FTX initially made.
*  Okay, so part of the explanation is AI and kind of riding the AI wave.
*  What about all of the money FTX had in cryptocurrencies?
*  I mean, it was an exchange for cryptocurrencies after all.
*  Yeah, I mean, in theory, FTX was supposed to be sitting on a huge number of cryptocurrencies
*  because that's what people were storing on the platform.
*  And it turned out that a lot of those assets had disappeared or they'd been converted into
*  other cryptocurrencies.
*  And so it wasn't as simple as the Bitcoin that you'd stored on the platform was still
*  there.
*  But one cryptocurrency that Bankman Fried maintained a large supply of was called Solana.
*  Back when FTX collapsed, Solana was trading at something like under $20 per token, really
*  at a low.
*  But since the collapse, Solana has surged again.
*  And in March, it hit about $200.
*  And the estate sold a large quantity of it and generated billions of dollars to return
*  to creditors from that sale.
*  And the rise in Solana is really part of a larger story in the crypto market, a resurgence
*  that's happened over the last year that's really shocked people and has sent these volatile
*  assets back to some of their all time highs.
*  OK, so essentially, it's the crypto market that's going to give FTX customers their money
*  back, at least in part.
*  There's been this upswing in the pendulum in recent months, and that is what accounts
*  for this reversal of fortune.
*  But explain to me how that's possible, how that's happened with crypto.
*  I mean, the last time we talked, crypto was really down for the count.
*  So it's a combination of factors.
*  One is a kind of perception within the crypto industry that the bad actors have been washed
*  out.
*  Sam Baichman Fried is in jail.
*  He's serving his sentence.
*  Chengpeng Zhao, who's the chief executive of another troubled crypto company, Binance,
*  also just got sentenced to prison time.
*  And so there's this feeling, right or wrong, in the crypto industry, that a new chapter
*  is beginning and that the bad guys are out of the picture.
*  But the real driver of this kind of market wide surge is Bitcoin, the original most
*  important, most valuable cryptocurrency.
*  And the cause of the surge is a recent court case.
*  The outcome of this case has essentially brought Bitcoin into the heart of the US economy and
*  mainstreamed it in a way that it's never been before.
*  So tell me about this case.
*  So the case involves a crypto company called Grayscale.
*  And what Grayscale wanted to do was offer a Bitcoin ETF.
*  That's an exchange traded fund, which is essentially a basket of assets that somebody can invest
*  in.
*  Instead of investing in the assets themselves directly, you're investing in the basket that
*  contains the asset.
*  So it's a little bit indirect.
*  And in the case of Bitcoin, it would mean you could just go onto your brokerage account
*  and buy a share in a basket of Bitcoin.
*  You don't have to worry about downloading an online wallet and figuring out the complications
*  of cryptocurrencies.
*  This was a way to open up the possibility of Bitcoin investment to more people.
*  But the federal government was very resistant to this.
*  ETFs are a pillar of the mainstream financial system.
*  They're a vehicle where people store their retirement savings and other crucial investments.
*  And the federal government basically said, this is too risky.
*  We don't want people's money to be locked up in this market that is super volatile and
*  that just over the last couple of years has plunged significantly.
*  Right.
*  I mean, it just had this massive crash recently, right?
*  So you wouldn't really think that like putting these things directly into American retirement,
*  your bank accounts would be a good idea.
*  So make sense to me that the government objects.
*  So what happens?
*  Well, there's a huge buildup to the resolution of this case.
*  Financial giant Fidelity now entering a new crypto race on Wall Street over these Bitcoin
*  ETFs.
*  While this case is pending, a bunch of other companies jump on board and apply to offer
*  their own Bitcoin ETFs.
*  And that includes pillars of the mainstream financial system that have generally been
*  cautious about dealing with digital assets.
*  Asset management giant BlackRock took the first steps yesterday to launch a spot.
*  Kicked off a sudden Floria activity, a race, if you will, to file these spot.
*  The whole crypto industry is watching.
*  It's considered very, very crucial.
*  Wall Street is getting invited in anticipation of the greatest show on earth.
*  And so everyone in the industry is waiting to see what the court will do.
*  And finally, the ruling arrives in August.
*  We're following new developments in the crypto world today as a U.S. federal court paves
*  the way for the first ever Bitcoin ETF.
*  And the industry wins.
*  The watershed moment for the crypto industry happening today.
*  Bitcoin ETFs set to begin trading in just about two hours from now.
*  It was a very long road to regulatory approval.
*  The court finds essentially that the SEC has failed to meet its burden to show that these
*  investment products shouldn't be allowed, that they're unsafe for the investing public.
*  And what that means is that in January, the SEC kind of grudgingly says, OK, you know,
*  our hand has been forced and these companies can go out and offer Bitcoin ETFs.
*  And so the ETFs start trading shortly after and they become really, really popular.
*  JP Morgan points out there's now been a total of 20 billion dollars of inflows into these
*  ETFs that's excluding.
*  People are seemingly very enthusiastic about putting their savings into these investment
*  vehicles.
*  Fidelity and BlackRock and the other companies that are offering them have to buy lots of
*  Bitcoin in order to support these investment offerings.
*  And as a result, the value of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin raced to an all time high today.
*  Bitcoin's price surges.
*  Seventy two thousand.
*  It hits its all time record, which is about seventy thousand dollars.
*  And remember, this was an asset that was dipping below twenty thousand dollars back
*  a year and a half ago in November 2022.
*  And so it's just an amazing surge.
*  So suddenly, Fidelity and BlackRock are trading these investment vehicles, these ETFs with
*  Bitcoin at the heart of them, which means that Bitcoin is no longer fringe.
*  It's mainstream.
*  Absolutely.
*  And this is a huge change because during the last crypto collapse, one thing that was striking
*  about it was that people who worked in the crypto industry or had investments in crypto,
*  they suffered as a result.
*  But the rest of the economy was basically walled off.
*  The fact that Bitcoin lost almost all of its value in a year, that didn't affect normal
*  people because most normal people didn't own Bitcoin.
*  And so what this change has done is set the stage for Bitcoin to essentially affect a
*  much broader swath of the population.
*  The precedent set by this major victory in the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs is maybe
*  the crypto industry can get what it wants.
*  Maybe it can defeat the federal government and really intersect with every other part
*  of the mainstream economy.
*  Which is pretty remarkable considering where it was just two years ago.
*  Absolutely.
*  I mean, we were at a point where people were declaring that crypto is dead.
*  That always sounded a little bit premature to me, but the turnaround we've seen over
*  the last year is nothing that anyone ever expected.
*  And this time, the stakes are even higher.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So crypto, as it turns out, is not dead.
*  And in fact, it's no longer even fringe, right?
*  It's mainstream.
*  What does that mean, David, for the next time there's a big crypto crash?
*  I mean, I'm assuming the federal government is going to feel some pressure to be on the
*  hook for it because these aren't just speculative internet investments, right?
*  They're solid retirement investments for average Americans.
*  So there are two schools of thought on this and how it could go.
*  If you ask a crypto proponent, they would point out that even though crypto has endured
*  these sort of boom and bust cycles over the years, the overall trend is up.
*  If you bought Bitcoin 10 years ago, you've seen massive gains.
*  And so giving more Americans a way to access that asset is a potentially positive thing.
*  That's the industry argument.
*  But certainly there are a lot of people who are really, really concerned about this because
*  last time crypto crashed, the rest of the economy, the mainstream economy, was essentially
*  walled off.
*  If you owned crypto and you'd experimented with digital currencies, in some cases you
*  lost all your savings and really suffered.
*  But everybody else, you know, they might not even have noticed.
*  And that could change.
*  I mean, now that the Bitcoin ETFs are rising in popularity, you know, more and more people
*  are likely to be connected to this volatile industry.
*  And so another downturn could ultimately harm a much broader swath of the population.
*  So a bigger chance for contagion to the rest of the U.S. economy should something go wrong
*  with crypto.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  I mean, is the ETF alone going to bring down the American economy?
*  Probably not.
*  But it's a first step in the direction of a kind of more systemic risk.
*  OK, so what are we really looking at here?
*  I mean, now that these Bitcoin ETFs have been approved, are we looking at a future where
*  other forms of crypto enter the mainstream as well?
*  There's actually a broader legal battle that's going on between the federal government and
*  the industry.
*  You know, the SEC is arguing in all sorts of court cases that a cryptocurrency is no
*  different from, you know, stock, essentially, like a share in a company that you might buy.
*  And that it should be regulated like that, meaning that someone can't just create a new
*  cryptocurrency and start selling it.
*  It has to be properly registered.
*  They have to make all sorts of disclosures associated with this product.
*  All of those rules that apply to public companies that are trading their shares on Wall Street.
*  And the agency frames this as a matter of investor protection.
*  This is how you ensure people know what they're buying when they kind of get into this weird
*  and volatile industry.
*  Crypto people are opposed to that.
*  And they have a few different visions of how the industry should actually be regulated.
*  In one version, they kind of compare cryptocurrencies to collectibles like Beanie Babies or trading
*  cards and say that the way in which a cryptocurrency accrues value over time is more akin to that
*  than to shares in a company that rise in value.
*  Some say we need entirely new rules.
*  Congress should start from scratch and come up with a new system just for governing cryptocurrencies.
*  So essentially, this is a very big new battle.
*  The government's saying the Wild West needs a sheriff, but we still don't know if it's
*  going to get one, right?
*  If it's going to prevail.
*  Well, the government is trying to be that sheriff.
*  It is actively suing a whole bunch of crypto companies, including some of the biggest in
*  the United States.
*  The most obvious example is Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto company currently getting
*  sued by the SEC.
*  And the potential outcome here is really, really damaging for these companies.
*  The government is arguing that they've been operating as illegal securities exchanges.
*  And if the government prevails, we could see massive fines on such a scale that they could
*  even bankrupt some of these companies.
*  And the ultimate outcome there is crypto getting driven out of the U.S., companies moving offshore,
*  all those weird startups with dog names relocating to Singapore or whatever jurisdiction happens
*  to be flavor of the month.
*  And in fact, we're already seeing that to some extent.
*  There has been a flight from the U.S. by a few crypto startups that are kind of worried
*  about how this might work out.
*  But then there's another scenario, the one that the Bitcoin ETF victory almost previewed
*  for us, where the crypto industry actually wins.
*  The federal government is unable to prove that these digital currencies should be regulated
*  like securities.
*  And the industry flourishes in the U.S.
*  It becomes more and more mainstream.
*  And everyday Americans start pouring their savings into it.
*  Which again, seems quite risky.
*  It's definitely a major, major risk.
*  And even when the SEC approved the Bitcoin ETF back in January, Gary Gensler, the SEC
*  chair, who's this huge villain in the crypto industry, is very opposed to the kind of expansion
*  of the industry.
*  He kind of couched his approval of this product with all sorts of warnings.
*  These products are dangerous.
*  Bitcoin's price goes up and down all of the time.
*  It was a sort of moment of victory for the industry that was framed by the SEC as this
*  real cautionary episode.
*  Where will this be decided, David?
*  These cases are likely to reach the Supreme Court.
*  I mean, it's difficult to predict, of course.
*  But given the way some preliminary rulings have gone, I think that we're likely to see
*  a sort of split situation where we have divergent rulings coming from different judges.
*  And that's the type of scenario where you ultimately need the Supreme Court.
*  So, David, going back to the beginning of our conversation, all of this explains why
*  customers of FTX are going to get their money back.
*  Should this change the way we think about Sam Bankman Fried?
*  I do remember him saying that he just needed a little bit more time to come up with the
*  money.
*  And he was kind of laughed at.
*  And then he went to jail.
*  But now that investors are getting their money back, crypto is back up and kind of really
*  in the swing of things.
*  Was he right?
*  I think Sam Bankman Fried would love to claim this news as a moment of vindication for him.
*  But it really isn't, frankly.
*  Legally, it doesn't actually make that much of a difference.
*  This issue of recoveries for customers came up at trial.
*  And what the judge said, basically, was that if you rob the bank, you steal $1,000 and
*  you use the $1,000 to buy lottery tickets, and you end up with a million dollars, and
*  you can repay the bank, you still robbed it in the first place.
*  There are laws in place preventing that because most of the time, you don't end up winning
*  the lottery.
*  On the other hand, there is kind of an alternate history here.
*  A version of events where there isn't a bank run on FTX in November of 2022, and the company
*  doesn't collapse, in which all of these investments that SBF has made profit to some degree, and
*  the company is in a position to repay people.
*  It's a totally theoretical universe, and who knows if it ever would have played out that
*  way.
*  Maybe he would have just stolen more money.
*  But there's definitely a certain irony in the way that things have played out.
*  If the timing had been slightly different, the whole course of SBF's history could have
*  been changed.
*  So that's one irony.
*  But there's also another, which is that what the crypto industry has achieved over the
*  past couple of months is essentially what Sam Bankman Fried set out to do in the first
*  place.
*  Like the reason he became the face of crypto went before Congress, advocated for regulation,
*  is that he wanted crypto to go mainstream.
*  He wanted average Americans to have access to it through his platform.
*  And now they sort of do.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  Crypto is as important as it's ever been.
*  It's becoming more enmeshed in the American economy.
*  People are pouring money back in.
*  The numbers on the lines are going up.
*  And I would caution against seeing crypto success only in terms of how high the price
*  has gone or how much money FTX's customers might get back.
*  Because crypto was initially sold to the public by evangelists who described it as a system
*  that was supposed to be about a lot more than just price.
*  It was supposed to transform finance, overhaul how we're using money, you know, offer access
*  to the financial system to people who'd been locked out.
*  And so far, it just hasn't.
*  The industry has never actually produced something that Americans really embraced as a practical
*  use.
*  I mean, for most people, this is just an investment.
*  And the industry's role in the economy has expanded in ways that are potentially dangerous.
*  And it's done that without actually solving any of these problems or answering any of
*  these unanswered questions that have lingered for years at this point.
*  David, thank you.
*  Thanks for having me, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Monday, the chief prosecutor at the world's top criminal court announced that he was seeking
*  arrest warrants for the leaders of both Israel and Hamas on charges of crimes against humanity.
*  The request must still be approved by the judges from the International Criminal Court.
*  And that could take months.
*  But it represents one of the harshest rebukes to date of Israel's war strategy and of its
*  leader, Benjamin Netanyahu.
*  And Iranian authorities sought to project a sense of order and calm after the deaths
*  of the president and foreign minister in a helicopter crash over the weekend.
*  The country's first vice president assumed the role as acting president.
*  And new presidential elections were scheduled for June.
*  Iranian state media reported on Monday that the crash happened because of a, quote, technical
*  failure.
*  The deaths leave the country without two influential leaders at a particularly tumultuous moment
*  of international tension and domestic discontent.
*  Although analysts and regional officials expect little change in Iran's foreign or domestic
*  policies.
