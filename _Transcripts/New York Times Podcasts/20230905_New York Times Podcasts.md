# Passenger Planes Nearly Collide Far More Than You Know
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25CIrpk6YdM)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Barrow. This is The Daily.
*  Today, a Times investigation has found that U.S. passenger planes come dangerously close
*  to crashing into each other far more frequently than the public knows. My colleague, Cindy
*  Amber, explains why an aviation system known for its safety is producing such a steady
*  stream of close calls. It's Tuesday, September 5th.
*  Cindy, tell us how this investigation started for you.
*  You might remember back in the winter, travel for passengers became a total nightmare.
*  Southwest had a meltdown, and then a couple weeks later, there was a system failure at
*  the Federal Aviation Administration. This led to lots of delays, lots of cancellations,
*  and thousands of passengers were stranded. They were livid. Congress was mad. Our editor
*  came to us and essentially said, go figure out why air travel is so annoying.
*  Right. And seemingly so broken.
*  And seemingly so broken. We started talking to people in the aviation industry. We started
*  talking to people who worked at airlines, pilots. We started talking to air traffic
*  controllers, really anyone we could think of who might be able to explain this to us.
*  What they started saying was actually there's a more important story here to tell, and
*  it's about safety. The safety system, aviation underlying safety for planes and passengers
*  is under tremendous stress. And at the same time, we started seeing a spate of public
*  And these were near collisions between two planes that were occurring generally around
*  or at airports.
*  A terrifying near miss between two passenger planes on the runway at New York's JFK airport.
*  There was one incident in mid-January at JFK.
*  Delta 1943, cancel takeoff plans.
*  An American Airlines plane made a wrong turn and crossed a runway as a Delta plane was
*  taking off.
*  You could feel a jolt as the brakes activated.
*  Several weeks later.
*  In Austin, an airport crisis caught just in time.
*  A FedEx plane was cleared to land as a Southwest plane was cleared to take off.
*  Just seconds away from disaster, the FedEx pilots initiated what is called a go around.
*  There were other incidents in Sarasota, one in Boston.
*  It was just the latest instance of a close call at an airport, leaving many wondering
*  what's going on.
*  It was just a whole slew of incidents that directed attention on whether aviation, you
*  know, flying as we know it is safe.
*  Right. So it sounds like just as people in the industry are telling you, hey, there's
*  a safety problem, focus on that, that you can't not focus on it because these incidents
*  are starting to happen.
*  So what did you do next?
*  Oh, man, we continue to talk to people and we started asking them, are these incidents
*  that have been occurring across the country?
*  Are there more of them than we know about?
*  And also what's causing them?
*  And what they told us was there is no real authoritative comprehensive source that shows
*  how many commercial planes are coming into these near collisions.
*  And so what I started doing with my colleague, Emily Steele, was digging around and trying
*  to figure out if we could identify close calls that hadn't been publicly reported or that
*  most of the public wouldn't know about.
*  So we started combing through public databases, including one maintained by NASA that have
*  reports by pilots, air traffic controllers, really anyone involved in aviation about any
*  safety issues, including close calls.
*  And eventually we were also able to gain access to these safety reports that detail incidents
*  across the country that are distributed to a select group of employees at the Federal
*  Aviation Administration.
*  And so putting all of this together, these safety reports, these public databases, a
*  picture started to emerge of a lot more close calls than almost anyone realizes are happening,
*  occurring extremely frequently, really alarmingly frequently.
*  Well, what do you mean, just how frequently, just how alarmingly frequently did you find
*  based on all this data that these close calls are happening?
*  So using these safety reports and these other databases, what we found was this was happening
*  multiple times on average every week.
*  And we looked at July, for example, and we saw at least 46 close calls that had occurred
*  involving commercial passenger planes in the US.
*  Wait, I just want to pause on that.
*  That means more than once a day, 46 times in a single month.
*  That's right.
*  On average, it seemed like they were happening more than once a day.
*  And then when we looked at the NASA database for the most recent 12 month period for which
*  data is available, what we saw was roughly 300 documented reports of close calls on the
*  ground and in the air.
*  I mean, that's astonishing.
*  That suggests that there is a kind of crisis level frequency of planes nearly colliding.
*  That's right.
*  It was shocking.
*  It also confirmed what a lot of people involved in the industry were telling us, that this
*  is happening just way, way more than the public realizes.
*  See, I want us to define this term we're using because it's going to be very important for
*  the rest of our conversation.
*  When we say close call, what exactly do we mean?
*  So a classic example is something that occurs on a runway where you can actually see it,
*  where two planes get too close together, a pilot has to slam on the brakes.
*  That's a classic example of a close call.
*  But in the air, there are also rules about how close these planes can get to each other.
*  And in general, planes are not supposed to get within three miles horizontally and a
*  thousand feet vertically of each other.
*  And this doesn't necessarily sound really close, especially if you're used to driving
*  a car where these sound like pretty big distances.
*  But remember that planes are going hundreds of miles an hour in the air, sometimes over
*  500 miles an hour.
*  And these gaps can close within seconds.
*  So Zinnia, give us some examples of the really close calls that you have been finding in
*  these databases and in these FAA reports that most of us didn't even know have happened.
*  Sure.
*  So in July, for example, there was an incident that occurred in New Orleans at the New Orleans
*  airport where a Delta Airlines flight is preparing to take off on a runway.
*  And at the same time, a Southwest plane is cleared to land on the exact same runway.
*  The Southwest pilot realizes that it's getting too close and at the last second pulls up
*  and aborts the landing and avoids a potential collision by just seconds.
*  Wow. I mean, that would have been absolutely awful.
*  An accelerating plane on the same runway as a very fast approaching landing plane would
*  have potentially been catastrophic.
*  Exactly. And then a little over a week later in San Francisco, an American Airlines plane
*  is accelerating down the runway for takeoff at more than 160 miles per hour and narrowly
*  misses a Frontier Airlines plane whose nose had jutted into its path on the same runway.
*  And then moments later, a German airliner is also accelerating for takeoff and just
*  misses the Frontier Airlines plane.
*  And so the American Airlines plane and the German airliner got so close to the Frontier
*  Airlines plane that in internal documents, the FAA describes these encounters as, quote,
*  skin to skin.
*  Which is a very evocative phrase.
*  It sounds like FAA way of saying way too close.
*  Way, way, way too close.
*  And then two and a half weeks later in the sky, an American flight to Dallas was traveling
*  up more than 500 miles per hour when a collision alert blares in the cockpit because a United
*  flight had been given incorrect instructions and was on a collision course with the American
*  flight.
*  At the last second, the American pilot had to yank the plane up and it climbed 700 feet
*  to avoid a potential collision.
*  Sydney, these are clearly close calls, terrifyingly close calls, but none of them produced actual
*  collisions.
*  And if you fly in America, you are constantly reminded that our passenger airline system
*  is the safest in the world and planes don't crash.
*  They don't fall out of the sky.
*  And so how worried should we really be about these close calls that you're describing?
*  So let's be clear.
*  It is incredibly safe to fly.
*  The last fatal crash involving a major US airline occurred 14 years ago in 2009.
*  But what people are telling us is that that safety record sort of masks these risks that
*  we've uncovered.
*  And so in the last few years, we've seen a lot of near collisions are occurring so frequently
*  that we have people in the aviation industry warning that we might be on borrowed time
*  here, that a collision is more likely than you want to believe it is.
*  And so, for example, in the NASA database, there are some entries from pilots and I'll
*  read a couple of them, if that's okay.
*  One who had been involved in a close call wrote, honestly, this stuff scares the crap
*  out of me.
*  And another pilot after being involved in a close call on a runway in January wrote,
*  this has really opened my eyes to how the next aviation accident may play out.
*  And these kind of warnings are coming even from federal officials.
*  So in March, the chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, she said, quote,
*  the absence of a fatality or an accident doesn't mean the presence of safety.
*  And she went on to say that these close calls must serve as a wake up call for every single
*  one of us before something more catastrophic occurs before lives are lost.
*  So Sydney, the inevitable question is, why is this happening?
*  Why are there so many close calls occurring on the ground and in the sky?
*  That's exactly the question we were asking people in the aviation industry.
*  And what they told us was this is emblematic of a safety system that is under incredible
*  strain.
*  And this safety system has been under strain for a long time.
*  But as air traffic starts returning to pre-pandemic levels, as everyone wants to fly, this is
*  reaching a breaking point.
*  The safety system is now so strained that it's reached a full blown crisis.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Sydney, tell us about this safety system that is clearly under some real strain.
*  So the safety system that keeps planes and passengers safe is really interesting.
*  It's built on layers.
*  And you can think of these layers as there is the air traffic control layer, the people
*  who are guiding the planes through the skies and into and out of airports.
*  There are the pilots who are steering these planes and looking out at the skies around
*  them.
*  And then you also have technology, technology on runways and technology on the planes themselves
*  that alert controllers and pilots to potential collisions.
*  And in aviation circles, this safety system is known as the Swiss cheese model.
*  So think about getting half a pound of Swiss cheese for your sandwiches at the grocery
*  store and you have all these different slices.
*  If something slips through the hole on one slice, the odds are that the next slice underneath
*  it, the holes are not going to align and the cheese is going to stop the thing from slipping
*  through the rest of the stack of Swiss cheese.
*  And there are all these redundancies built into the system.
*  So if one layer fails, the other layers are going to catch it.
*  So based on your reporting, which of these layers is faltering and leading to these close
*  calls?
*  So what we found in our reporting was a lot of these close calls are caused by mistakes
*  among air traffic controllers and also among pilots.
*  And what we found was actually the most acute challenge is the shortage of air traffic controllers
*  across the country.
*  OK, so explain that.
*  Why is there a shortage of air traffic controllers and how is that leading to this problem of
*  close calls?
*  So the shortage in air traffic controllers has been going on for years and it actually
*  dates back to the early 1980s.
*  Air traffic controllers went on strike illegally.
*  Their federal employees, they were not supposed to strike and President Reagan fired them.
*  He fired thousands of them.
*  And to replenish the ranks, the government then had to hire new air traffic controllers.
*  And what this did was it sort of knocked off kilter the natural cycle of hiring people
*  and having those people eventually retire at different times.
*  Instead, what you had was all of these controllers were hired at once and then it created mass
*  waves of retirement.
*  It gets a little complicated, but air traffic controllers have to retire by the age of 56
*  and they start becoming eligible to retire after 20 years of service.
*  And what happened was the FAA really just couldn't keep up with these mass retirements.
*  It started falling behind and then the pandemic hit.
*  And the pandemic made things just a lot worse.
*  Why?
*  So of course you had air traffic controllers who quit or retired early, as happened around
*  the country in lots and lots of different industries, but it also slowed training.
*  Training for air traffic controllers takes a while.
*  It's very intense.
*  But because of health restrictions, you couldn't train as many air traffic controllers as the
*  FAA had to train.
*  And so you just start falling more and more and more behind.
*  And at this point, there are something like 10% fewer fully certified air traffic controllers
*  than there were a decade ago.
*  In fact, we analyzed some numbers and there are only three air traffic facilities in the
*  country that are considered fully staffed as of May.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, out of 313.
*  Sydney, the FAA presumably has had years to recognize this shortage as a natural extension
*  of what Ronald Reagan did and to find ways to recruit to balance it out.
*  So why hasn't that happened?
*  Well so the truth is that being a controller is a really, really demanding, difficult job.
*  It's highly stressful.
*  They are spending long, long hours staring at planes.
*  Think about trying to keep planes apart that you know have passengers on them.
*  And many controllers work a grueling schedule called the rattler, which is essentially rotating
*  shifts that start earlier and earlier in the day until you get to the last day of your
*  schedule where you work two shifts in a 24-hour period.
*  Wow.
*  This really messes with their sleep schedules.
*  And if you don't have enough air traffic controllers, what ends up happening is many have to work
*  mandatory six-day work weeks.
*  They have to work an extra day.
*  And this is what they say is leading to a lot of these close calls.
*  They're just so, so exhausted mentally, physically that they can't focus and that the focus required
*  to be an air traffic controller, they're just unable to keep for that long.
*  So what about the pilots?
*  Why are they, as a layer of safety in the system, under strain right now when it comes
*  to close calls?
*  So during the pandemic, you might remember that air traffic tanked.
*  No one wanted to fly on planes and airlines started furloughing their pilots and encouraging
*  their older pilots to retire.
*  And what happened was these older experienced pilots, a lot of them did retire and to replenish
*  those ranks, the major carriers started drawing on regional airline pilots and the experience
*  level in the cockpits decreased.
*  So if you think about a 16-year-old driver versus a 45-year-old driver, the 16-year-old
*  driver is going to be more prone to making mistakes.
*  This is what people in the industry tell us that on average, the experience level of pilots
*  is a little lower, they're a little less seasoned.
*  So they're just more prone to making mistakes.
*  But according to the Swiss cheese safety model, if I'm understanding what you told me correctly,
*  an inexperienced pilot shouldn't be a huge problem if they make an error because the
*  next layer is supposed to catch them, you know, the air traffic controller.
*  And even if that air traffic controller is overstretched or tired, they should have their
*  error caught by a pilot even if they are a little bit less experienced than in the past,
*  right?
*  I mean, that's the thinking.
*  That's right.
*  But what you can see is if you have less seasoned pilots in the cockpit and you have overworked
*  exhaustive controllers, those holes in each layer of the Swiss cheese are getting bigger
*  and they're more likely to align.
*  The mistake is going to slip through both layers.
*  Take a recent incident in Phoenix that occurred in early August.
*  A controller gave an instruction to a pilot on an American Airlines plane about the departure
*  he was supposed to take after he took off from the runway.
*  And the pilot repeated the instructions back incorrectly.
*  The air traffic controller didn't hear the incorrect readback.
*  And so the American plane takes off and instead of turning right, it turns left.
*  At the same time, a Southwest plane had taken off.
*  And so this American plane is now turning into the path of the Southwest plane.
*  1388 Phoenix departure, verify 4P1 departure.
*  We actually have the audio of when another controller realizes what's happening.
*  1388 traffic alert, nine o'clock, less than a mile, Boeing 737-3000, do you have a traffic
*  insight?
*  Yeah, we have an alert at 1388.
*  It can sound kind of confusing.
*  The controller is repeating things to the pilot.
*  The pilots are repeating it back.
*  I'm sitting right there.
*  Do you see the traffic?
*  They're from America 1388.
*  But what you really note is the urgency in the controller's voice.
*  1286, if you need to turn left, immediately do so.
*  He tells the Southwest plane, turn if you need to.
*  Okay, did you make the turn?
*  We checked about 30 to the left.
*  And eventually, the planes do start diverging.
*  They do turn away from each other.
*  And the original sin in this situation is kind of a worst case scenario for this multilayered
*  system because you have an error by a pilot not being caught by that first controller,
*  a kind of double failure.
*  Exactly.
*  And what happened was these planes got so close together, they got a third of a mile
*  horizontally and 300 feet vertically to each other, which with planes going hundreds of
*  miles per hour is so, so dangerously close.
*  Okay.
*  So then, Sydney, we get to the next layer of this safety system, what you call the technology
*  that is supposed to keep these planes apart.
*  What's the story there and why is it potentially contributing to the close calls?
*  So most importantly, there is technology that alerts air traffic controllers to potential
*  collisions.
*  This is surface detection technology.
*  But the problem there is that it's only at 43 airports in the country out of roughly
*  500 that serve commercial airlines.
*  Why so few?
*  So it's very expensive to install millions of dollars and it's also old.
*  And the FAA says they're looking for newer technology.
*  But the result of not having this technology at so many airports is close calls around
*  runways.
*  And you can see this, for instance, in Austin in the example that I mentioned earlier involving
*  the FedEx and Southwest planes that got really close to each other.
*  Austin doesn't have this service technology and that, people say, is one of the reasons
*  these planes did get so close to each other before the FedEx pilot pulled up and avoided
*  a collision.
*  And then there's another piece of technology that is really, really important on commercial
*  airlines.
*  This technology is basically a collision avoidance technology.
*  If two planes are getting too close to each other or are looking like they're going to
*  get too close to each other, this technology blares in the cockpit and either alerts the
*  pilot to potential traffic or tells the pilot to climb or descend if the planes are getting
*  too close to each other.
*  So Sydney, what is and what can be done to address all these strains?
*  Because everything you've told us suggests that the FAA knows about all these close calls.
*  So why haven't they done more to try to prevent them?
*  Well, it really comes down to money.
*  They would love to be able to hire more controllers, but it costs money.
*  They want to be able to install more technology on runways, but that also costs money and
*  they submit budget requests to Congress every year.
*  But in the end, it's the money that they get.
*  This is what they would tell us.
*  But even with these measures that they are saying they want to take, people tell us that
*  this is just not enough.
*  The shortage in air traffic controllers is so severe that the number of air traffic controllers
*  that the FAA wants to hire with the money that they have is not going to solve the problem.
*  The technology on runways is old and they need to find new technology.
*  They say that they are working on that, but that could be years from being installed.
*  So there's a lot of frustration right now among pilots and among air traffic controllers
*  that they want attention on this.
*  They want the public to know that close calls are happening and they want the FAA to do more.
*  Which makes sense.
*  And Sydney, what's so interesting and important about the investigation that you and Emily
*  Seale did is that it's coming before a deadly tragedy.
*  So often in journalism, we do this kind of reporting after something terrible happens.
*  And here you're finding that people are trying to ring the alarms and are ringing the alarms
*  before and in anticipation of a tragedy, which means that there is really an opportunity
*  to prevent something awful from happening.
*  Yeah, there is an opportunity here.
*  But what a lot of people we talked to said was they are worried that nothing is going
*  to happen or that the FAA is not going to do enough.
*  There's this sort of very, very cynical take, which is that the FAA in some circles is known
*  as the Tombstone Agency.
*  That is, they won't do anything until something catastrophic does occur, until people do die.
*  The people we talked to say there really is no excuse for the FAA not to do something
*  before one of these close calls leads to a fatal crash.
*  Sydney, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Monday, Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky pushed out his defense minister, the biggest
*  shakeup in the leadership of Ukraine's war effort since Russia invaded the country last
*  year.
*  The move is significant because the defense minister, Alexei Reznikov, has been a close
*  adviser to Zelensky and a public face of Ukraine's battle against Russia.
*  Zelensky did not specify why he was replacing Reznikov, but the decision comes amid widening
*  corruption investigations into the mishandling of military contracts related to the war.
*  Meanwhile, the U.S. revealed that the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, plans to meet
*  with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the possibility of supplying Russia with more
*  weaponry for its war against Ukraine.
*  The U.S. hopes that by exposing such an arrangement, it will discourage North Korea from following
*  through with an arms deal to Russia, a strategy that has worked in the past.
