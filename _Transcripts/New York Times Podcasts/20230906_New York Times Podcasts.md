# How 100,000 Migrants Became a Political Crisis in New York
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVXpCdKaSmY)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today.
*  In New York, the arrival of more than 100,000 migrants seeking asylum over the past year
*  has become a crisis for the city's shelter system, schools, and budget.
*  Now, according to my colleague, Nick Fandos, it's also become a political crisis for the
*  state's democratic leaders.
*  It's Wednesday, September 6th.
*  Good afternoon.
*  I'm speaking to you today so you're aware of what your state government is doing to
*  address the unprecedented migrant crisis.
*  Nick, tell me about this speech from the governor of New York.
*  So the governor of New York, Kathy Hochul, announced a couple of weeks ago that she was
*  going to be making a major address to the state.
*  These are pretty unusual for her.
*  I'm fully aware that New Yorkers are concerned that over the past year, more than 100,000
*  asylum seekers have arrived in our state, requiring an historic humanitarian response.
*  And she wanted to talk about the migrant crisis that's been building over the last year here
*  in New York and the new phase that New York seemed to be entering into as literally thousands
*  of asylum seekers come into the state every week.
*  But now, many of you are starting to see open space turn into enormous temporary shelters,
*  buses arriving at hotels in several upstate counties.
*  And what was particularly notable about this speech was not the way she was diagnosing
*  the problem, but where she was putting the blame.
*  This crisis originated with the federal government, and it must be resolved through the federal
*  government.
*  So for the first time, the governor of New York, and she's a Democrat, a proud Democrat,
*  came out and was putting the blame pretty squarely at the feet of the White House and
*  President Biden, saying, we need your help.
*  You got to step up here.
*  That's why today I have sent a letter to President Biden formally requesting immediate
*  executive action.
*  And as if she hadn't been clear enough, the governor then puts out a press release actually
*  naming President Biden, pointing the finger at him explicitly.
*  It is past time for President Biden to take action and provide New York with the aid needed
*  to continue managing the ongoing crisis.
*  So she's naming names, and the name she's naming is the Democratic president of the
*  United States, which means this isn't quite the normal course of events.
*  A Democratic governor from a very Democratic state directly critiquing in public her Democratic
*  president.
*  Yeah, you're totally right, Michael.
*  And it's even more striking because the governor had been very careful to take a more conciliatory
*  approach to Washington as New York has been dealing with this crisis.
*  She's been trying to talk to the White House regularly, which has been a pretty stark contrast
*  to Eric Adams, the mayor of New York and her counterpart as kind of the big Democratic
*  leader in New York.
*  This is one of the largest humanitarian crises that this city has ever experienced.
*  Who for months now has just been slugging at the White House.
*  Instead of standing on the steps of City Hall, we should be standing on the steps of the
*  White House.
*  Day after day, week after week, demanding more help.
*  And asking the national government, what are you doing to the city of New York?
*  And saying basically, President Biden is leaving New York high and dry.
*  The president and the White House has failed New York City on this issue.
*  Now you also have the governor joining him in saying that.
*  And in the last couple of weeks, as I've been reporting across the state, I've seen that
*  sentiment spreading like wildfire among Democratic congressional candidates that I've talked
*  to, particularly those running in House seats in the suburbs surrounding New York City.
*  Remember, just a year ago, Republicans helped win their House majority by sweeping through
*  a series of suburban swing districts around New York City and elsewhere in the state Democrats
*  had held for a long time.
*  Now these Democratic candidates that are trying to win these seats back, who see a path back
*  to the majority, but only through New York, are concerned that this issue, the arrival
*  of 100,000 asylum seekers and counting here in New York City, and all of the fallout from
*  it is going to become another super potent political issue that may once again cost them
*  these key seats and with it control of the House of Representatives.
*  Huh.
*  Nick, I want to talk about how it is we've reached this point where so many Democratic
*  lawmakers from, as you just said, the mayor to the governor to now candidates and even
*  members of Congress have become so riled up and publicly angry with their Democratic president
*  over this question of these migrants.
*  So where should we start?
*  So I think we have to go back a couple of years and down to the southern border, Michael,
*  where many of these asylum seekers are crossing into the United States in the first place.
*  The Trump White House and the Biden White House were able to use COVID era policies,
*  most notably Title 42, to basically shut down the border for a period of time.
*  And as that expired over the last year or so, there has been a significant buildup in
*  the number of people crossing the border in the first place.
*  And as that buildup is happening, as more and more migrants are crossing the border
*  into states like Texas, the governor there, Greg Abbott, in the middle of last year began
*  putting them on buses and giving them a one-way ticket to cities up north like New York and
*  Chicago and Washington, places that tend to be more liberal to try and provoke them, basically,
*  to poke at their liberal policies and say, hey, this is what we're dealing with down
*  in Texas.
*  Why don't you see what it feels like when they're at your doorstep?
*  Right.
*  The idea being to essentially bring the southern border and the broken immigration system to
*  these blue states in the north, effectively forcing them to deal with the same kind of
*  issues that Texas does because of where it is.
*  Yes.
*  And frankly, to make a political point, right, to show it's easy to state your values when
*  you're a thousand miles away and this is not on your doorstep.
*  Let's see how it goes once these people have arrived.
*  Right.
*  So over the course of the last year, as Abbott and then Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida are
*  North, New York really becomes the top destination and the epicenter of the migrant crisis in
*  this new phase.
*  Not only do you have these Republican governors sending people, but New York is a really attractive
*  magnet for people.
*  There's some unique factors, I think, that are worth pausing to consider for a second.
*  One, there's no city in the world that is probably more associated with immigrants and
*  immigration.
*  The Statue of Liberty stands in the harbor for a reason.
*  And New York has a reputation.
*  And so as people are crossing over the border, it's a natural destination.
*  And because there are so many immigrants already here, many people might have relatives or
*  relations.
*  And so when they're asked, where do you want to go, they say New York City.
*  New York City is also the only city in the country which has this unique mandate known
*  here as the right to shelter.
*  So going back to the 1980s, this says that New York City has to pay basically to house
*  anybody who doesn't have a bed tonight in New York City at the taxpayer expense.
*  They'll be put up in a shelter or somewhere else, which means that migrants who come here
*  to New York are going to get shelter, they're going to get legal assistance, they're going
*  to get health care, and their kids are going to be enrolled in public schools.
*  So that means that everybody that's arriving on these buses are entitled to those benefits.
*  But word also gets out very quickly, and it makes New York City seem like a very attractive
*  place to want to steer yourself.
*  Even if you're not being brought up on a bus from a Republican official in Texas who wants
*  to make a political point.
*  Right, and people come through all sorts of different routes and different means of transportation.
*  So what starts as a political stunt to steer migrants to New York City evolves into something
*  quite different.
*  Now they're not coming here under the influence of a governor, but because they want to be
*  in New York City.
*  It's a destination, a place that they want to start a new life.
*  And when that starts to happen, this influx really takes on a life of its own.
*  Over the weekend, the city reached a critical tipping point for their already jam-packed
*  shelters.
*  2000, 3000 people a week sometimes are coming in through the Port Authority and need a place
*  to stay at night.
*  And by law, they have one.
*  In response to the growing number of migrants arriving here, Mayor Adams announced new humanitarian
*  emergency response and relief centers.
*  Two centers will be opening in the coming weeks.
*  And the city already has a large network of homeless shelters that operates, but those
*  are becoming strange.
*  You have people sitting in shelters and in hotel rooms with no place to go, no work,
*  no way to get around the city.
*  They start putting migrants in hotels.
*  Since last week, angry residents out on Staten Island shouted at migrants arriving.
*  Do you get free Wi-Fi at home?
*  I don't.
*  Do you get free cell phone at home?
*  I don't.
*  The city has started building these massive tent structures all around the city in parks
*  and in public spaces.
*  In Floyd Bennett Field, it is a flood zone.
*  A place where people go to recreate and play soccer and walk their dogs.
*  They were at capacity, so these migrants were left to sleep on the sidewalk.
*  You can see the only thing separating them from the concrete is cardboard.
*  At one point, they appear at least to become so backlogged, you started seeing hundreds
*  of migrants sleeping on the sidewalk outside of one of the intake centers in Midtown Manhattan,
*  which was a real kind of alarm bell moment that this is getting out of control.
*  Who is going to really suffer if we continue in this way?
*  It's going to be our services, sanitation, education, police department, fire department.
*  And so we have to stop it now.
*  All this costs a lot of money, Michael.
*  New York City and New York State have already spent billions of dollars collectively and
*  are estimating that this could cost $10 to $12 billion over the next couple of years.
*  Now, these are places with big tax bases and big budgets, but that's a big chunk of change.
*  Like that level of spending is not sustainable.
*  And it's not part of the budget because it wasn't anticipated.
*  It was not anticipated.
*  And it means down the line, unless this money comes magically from somewhere else, New York
*  is going to have to start looking at cutting certain services, cutting back on its budgets
*  for things that longtime New Yorkers may count on.
*  Just this week, for example, New York City is trying to house 58,000 migrants on top
*  of its regular homeless population.
*  Which is the population of a meaningful city.
*  Yeah, a lot of cities in the country.
*  And put, get this 20,000 children into the New York City public school system to begin
*  educating them.
*  And all of this, Michael, has been building towards what feels like potentially a breaking point.
*  The cost is just ramping up and up and up in terms of people, in terms of budget, in
*  terms of actual space.
*  I mean, where do you put these numbers of people in New York City or in the state?
*  And it has begun to spill over into the political system.
*  Inevitably, a crisis of government becomes a crisis of politics.
*  And all of this is increasingly alarming for Democrats, who fear that this is an unpredictable
*  issue that could be a very potent weapon used against them next year in all kinds of races
*  across the state, and especially in the race for control of Congress.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Nick, what exactly do New York Democrats fear is going to happen because of this migrant
*  crisis that's unfolding across the city?
*  Just unpack that.
*  What scenario are they envisioning?
*  So to answer that, Michael, imagine it's a year from now.
*  We're on the eve of the election, and this problem has not abated.
*  There's been tens of thousands more migrants who have arrived in New York City, putting
*  more strain on all the different services we've been talking about.
*  The city's basically run out of space in a lot of places.
*  The state's trying to help, but it's running out of money.
*  And I think Democrats are very worried about the way that Republicans are going to portray
*  this and the way that voters are going to think about what's going on here.
*  Are they going to conclude that Democrats' policy to welcome immigrants, to say, we treat
*  them differently here and we give them services.
*  Is that going to backfire and say, well, look, that's all nice.
*  We like those values in a vacuum, but that means you're kind of pulling out of my pocket
*  to take care of these people.
*  And now Republicans very much are already beginning to make this argument that this
*  is the consequence of Democrats' liberal policies on immigration.
*  And not only have they helped bring about this situation, now that it's at their doorstep,
*  they can't competently handle it.
*  They're all pointing fingers at one another.
*  There's an appearance of chaos that nobody's in charge.
*  And look, this is the sum package of what Democrats get you.
*  So what Democrats fear is that Republicans will make the case in the next election that
*  Democrats created this crisis and now they have no idea how to fix it.
*  And you, dear New Yorker, you are left to suffer, which is why you should vote for Republicans.
*  Exactly.
*  And I think part of the reason the Democrats are so worried about this is what happened
*  in 2022.
*  So remember, Michael, we sat here and talked then about the way that Republicans were able
*  to use fears about crime and rising crime in New York City to basically point at Democratic
*  policies and say, this is the reason this is happening.
*  And now these guys can't get it under control.
*  Right.
*  And there was a degree to which that claim was exaggerated.
*  And yet it proved very potent in those 2022 congressional elections.
*  Right.
*  And it wiped out basically every Democrat on the congressional map in districts that
*  really should have been safe Democratic territory, but became a real bloodbath for them.
*  Right.
*  So obviously there are big substantive policy differences between these two issues of crime
*  and migration.
*  But the political dynamic and the kind of interaction among the two parties and voters
*  are very similar.
*  You have a big situation in the center of New York City, a kind of unfolding crisis
*  that on any given day lends itself to some headline about disorder or conflict.
*  And it's being piped out into the swingier suburbs that surround New York City where
*  voters are watching and frankly thinking in this state where Democrats have been control
*  of everything for a long time, like maybe they're just screwing it up again.
*  Got it.
*  Give us some examples of the Democrats in these swingier suburbs around New York becoming
*  agitated about what's going on here.
*  Okay, so the first person I point you to is Pat Ryan, who was the only Democrat who survived
*  that Republican wipeout over crime last year.
*  He represents a seat in kind of the lower Hudson Valley.
*  North of New York City, hour and a half, two hours.
*  Right.
*  So earlier this year when Mayor Eric Adams proposed busing migrants out of the city into
*  some communities in Ryan's district to help shoulder some of the burden, Ryan was one
*  of a number of officials who freaked out.
*  He called on President Biden to declare a state of emergency, which is a pretty drastic
*  step.
*  He voted for a Republican bill that would have basically barred schools from housing
*  migrants in New York, said, well, take away federal funds if you do.
*  And he's adopted very aggressive rhetoric towards not just the mayor, but also the President
*  of the United States.
*  So last week when I spoke to Ryan, who's a former army officer, he told me that the one
*  thing that I learned above all in my time in the army is that when you're in charge,
*  you have to take charge.
*  The president is in charge here and he's not taking charge.
*  So like Mayor Adams and now Governor Hockel, Congressman Ryan is turning his frustration
*  over the situation onto the president.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  And he's not alone in doing it.
*  Candidates from Long Island like Laura Gillen, Mondaire Jones, who's a former Democratic
*  congressman trying to make a comeback in Westchester County in the suburbs north of the city,
*  other candidates in the Hudson Valley are all pointing their finger at President Biden
*  and saying like, you've got to get in the game on this.
*  This is a federal problem and we need a federal solution to it.
*  Well, with that in mind, what specifically do these New York Democrats want Joe Biden,
*  want the federal government to do here, given the nature of the problem and some of the
*  unique factors you have outlined, like New York City's right to shelter?
*  That's a great question.
*  So there are basically a handful of important requests that they have.
*  The first one is for money.
*  We were talking earlier about how much New York City and state are spending on this and
*  they feel this is a federal issue, right?
*  So the federal government ought to be reimbursing for National Guard for the cost of sheltering,
*  basically to help shoulder some of the costs.
*  Another important thing that they want is for the White House to help people get to
*  work faster.
*  So the prime example of this is something called temporary protected status.
*  It's where the president can himself grant a group of people from a specific country
*  a special status to make it easier for them to get a work permit.
*  And that's important in this case because when migrants can get jobs, they're making
*  money, they're paying into the system, they become less reliant on shelters and health
*  care and other public benefits like that.
*  Got it.
*  So the idea is that temporary protected status gets migrants on their own to feed in a way
*  that means they're not going to need New York City's resources as much.
*  And I guess in theory, it might discourage some of these migrants from ever coming to
*  New York in the first place because if they have the right to work, they might stop at
*  many other states on that journey north to New York and find a job.
*  Yeah, that may be the case.
*  But I think it's worth just pausing here to say New York is in such a drastic circumstance
*  right now and it's such a fast moving situation that I don't think New York's leaders are
*  really thinking that far down the road.
*  They're just thinking about how do we alleviate this situation right now?
*  How do we move some of those 58,000 people out of the shelters as quickly as we can?
*  Got it.
*  So what has President Biden said about these two requests for a lot more money to help
*  solve this problem as well as temporary protected status for a lot of these migrants?
*  Well, the first thing to say, and this is one of the things that's really frustrating
*  Democrats here, is that he hasn't said much at all.
*  He's not giving a major speech on this issue.
*  It's not like we've seen him come into New York for photo ops to try and take control
*  in a way that you might expect an executive facing a big national problem like this to
*  do.
*  But the White House has done some small things around the edges.
*  So on the money front, the Biden administration has helped secure hundreds of millions of
*  dollars to reimburse New York.
*  Now that's not as much as New York once.
*  It says it needs billions, but the White House has put its hands up basically and said, look,
*  the US controls the purse strings.
*  We can ask for more money, but I can't guarantee you we're going to get it.
*  Got it.
*  And on the question of work permits, the response has been more complicated, and the White House
*  has actually pushed back a bit on New York.
*  Why?
*  Their concern, particularly with temporary protected status, is that it's going to create
*  an incentive for more people to come actually, and will exacerbate the national immigration
*  problem.
*  So while it might help New York in the short term, it's going to make the United States
*  a much more attractive place to come.
*  Bearing all the risks in mind of getting to the United States, if you are a member of
*  a protected group and you know when I get to the United States, I'm going to be able
*  to have certain protections there.
*  I'm going to be able to work into a more attractive offer.
*  Basically, what President Biden is saying in response is that what's good for New York,
*  unfortunately, is not good for the rest of the country, and it's not good policy.
*  That's right.
*  So there's clearly a stalemate here, which I'm guessing is extremely frustrating, especially
*  to these New York Democrats trying to deal with this crisis.
*  I'm curious if any of these Democrats who are leveling this criticism against Biden
*  have had any reservations about criticizing the leader of their party in their conversations
*  with you, given that he is running for reelection and that the polls suggest it's going to be
*  a very tight race.
*  It doesn't seem like an opportune moment for candidates and members of Congress in the
*  Democratic Party to be criticizing the president.
*  I think that that's a really good question, and it's something that Democrats are definitely
*  thinking about in this moment where it kind of feels like it's every Democrat for themselves.
*  The risk here, I think, is that for these candidates to point at President Biden or
*  even at Mayor Adams or Governor Hockel to kind of get the blame off themselves to make
*  it look like I'm taking this seriously, this person is failing to provide leadership, that
*  may help them in the short term, but I think that there's a real risk of a kind of boomerang
*  effect that comes back around and makes it look like to, you know, your average voter
*  who's maybe not that politically engaged, then instead of solving this, Democrats are
*  just fighting with each other.
*  The governor's blaming the mayor who's blaming the president who's blaming the congressman.
*  And that's not a great look for the party.
*  That's in fact exactly what they're afraid Republicans are going to succeed in reinforcing.
*  This idea that Democrats are more interested in bickering at each other and are not here
*  to solve the problem.
*  Right. For example, if you're Biden, you might be very tempted to turn around and say to
*  these members of Congress who are mad at him, look, this is your job.
*  It's your job as a member of Congress to fix immigration.
*  Yeah.
*  And there's some truth to that, right?
*  I mean, we've been having a debate in this country for decades now about the need for
*  comprehensive immigration reform.
*  Both parties have some responsibility in it not having passed, and both parties agree
*  that the system is broken as it is right now.
*  There was a proposal about a decade ago that was bipartisan that got close to passing and
*  Republicans tanked it.
*  So if you're Democrats, you could look at this whole situation and go on the attack
*  and say, actually, it's Republicans who have stood in the way of comprehensive reform,
*  the kind of thing that may have helped us prevent this crisis unfolding in New York
*  right now.
*  And so they're actually the ones that you should be blaming for this.
*  And we do have some Democratic candidates attacking Republicans on this and saying,
*  You guys control the House.
*  You're the ones in power in Washington.
*  It's your responsibility to help fix this.
*  But I think the thing is, it's just hard for that to break through when you have the mayor
*  and the governor, Democrats with bigger platforms than anybody else in New York, just pointing
*  fingers at each other.
*  Right.
*  It strikes me, Nick, that for Republicans, this entire episode has been a very successful
*  political strategy, a cynical strategy in many people's minds, but a very effective
*  one, because what started with a few busloads of migrants sent to New York to embarrass
*  the leaders of a blue state has now triggered all this infighting, like you just described
*  among the Democrats.
*  And it has given Republicans this very powerful weapon to use in these crucial House races
*  and potentially a roadmap for keeping control of Congress.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's no small deal.
*  And I'd add one more thing.
*  It's made the mayor of the largest city in the country and one of the most important
*  Democratic governors in the country into critics of the president.
*  And though they may not agree with Greg Abbott or other Republicans about what the policy
*  failures are here or how to fix it, they have validated the essential structure that President
*  Biden is responsible for this and ought to be taking more drastic action.
*  You don't often see that in politics, right?
*  The Democrats are saying to the whole world, maybe they don't even mean to say this, the
*  Republicans are kind of right about Biden and immigration.
*  That is certainly how Republicans are going to present it.
*  So Nick, what happens next in this story and specifically what happens to all these migrants,
*  these 100,000 men, women and children who are now in New York City?
*  A lot of these people went through arduous conditions to get here in the first place
*  and they're going to work really hard and figure out how to get jobs either legally
*  or in the underground economy and make money and move out of the shelter system.
*  But as long as people continue to come, as New York remains an attractive place, the
*  numbers are just going to continue to grow and put a greater and greater strain on New
*  York City and its capacity to care for these people.
*  And we've talked a lot about the political and government implications of that, but for
*  the migrants themselves, it means that they're going to be relying on an increasingly taxed
*  system that's not going to be able to provide for them in the way that it has.
*  And if that system buckles, it's going to leave a lot of very vulnerable people in a
*  very bad situation.
*  Well, Nick, thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Tuesday, the most powerful Republican in the U.S. Senate, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell
*  sought to reassure his colleagues that he is physically able to keep doing his job after
*  a series of on-camera medical episodes.
*  During those episodes, McConnell has frozen up for long stretches in the middle of news
*  conferences, seemingly unable to speak.
*  In a letter released on Tuesday by McConnell, the doctor who treats members of Congress
*  said he found no signs that McConnell suffered from either seizures or strokes, two possibilities
*  that have been raised by outside experts.
*  McConnell and his staff have instead attributed both instances to lightheadedness related
*  to a concussion he suffered in March and to dehydration.
*  And Enrico Tarrio, the former leader of the Proud Boys, was sentenced to 22 years in prison
*  for the role he played in the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol.
*  It was the most severe penalty imposed on anyone charged in connection with the deadly
*  assault.
*  Tarrio was found guilty of seditious conspiracy for inspiring and organizing members of his
*  pro-Trump gang to enter the Capitol and try to stop the peaceful transfer of presidential power.
*  Today's episode was produced by Carlos Prieto, Mary Wilson, Michael Simon Johnson, and Astha
*  Chaturvedi.
