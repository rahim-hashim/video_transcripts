# The Evolving Danger of the New Bird Flu
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr0ufyP0NfE)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  The outbreak of bird flu that is tearing through the nation's poultry farms is the worst in
*  U.S. history.
*  But scientists say it's now starting to spread into places and species it's never been before.
*  Today, my colleague, Emily Anthus, explains.
*  It's Monday, April 22nd.
*  Emily, welcome back to the show.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  Thanks for having me here.
*  So, Emily, we've been talking here on The Daily about prices of things and how they've
*  gotten so high, mostly in the context of inflation episodes.
*  And one of the items that keeps coming up is eggs.
*  Egg prices were through the roof last year.
*  And we learned that this was actually not just inflation, that something else was going
*  on.
*  And it was related to this.
*  Avian flu has been surging in the United States.
*  You've been covering this.
*  Tell us what's happening.
*  Yeah.
*  So I have been covering this virus for the last few years.
*  And the bird flu is absolutely tearing through poultry flocks.
*  And that is affecting egg prices.
*  That's a concern for everyone, for me and for my family.
*  But when it comes to scientists, egg prices are pretty low on their list of concerns because
*  They see this bird flu virus behaving differently than previous versions have.
*  And they're getting nervous in particular about the fact that this virus is reaching
*  places and species where it's never been before.
*  OK, so bird flu, though, isn't new.
*  I mean, I remember hearing about cases in Asia in the 90s.
*  Remind us how it began.
*  Bird flu refers to a bunch of different viruses that are adapted to spread best in birds.
*  In particular, are known for carrying these viruses.
*  And flu viruses are sort of famous for also being shape-shifters.
*  So they're constantly swapping genes around and evolving into new strains.
*  And as you mentioned, back in the 90s, a new version of bird flu, a virus known as H5N1,
*  emerged in Asia.
*  And it has been spreading on and off around the world since then, causing periodic outbreaks.
*  And how are these outbreaks caused?
*  So wild birds are the reservoir for the virus, which means they carry it in their bodies
*  with them around the world as they fly and travel and migrate.
*  And most of the time, these wild birds, like ducks and geese, don't even get very sick
*  from this virus, but they shed it.
*  So as they're traveling over a poultry farm, maybe, if they happen to go to the bathroom
*  in a pond that the chickens on the farm are using, or eat some of the feed that chickens
*  on the farm are eating, they can leave the virus behind.
*  And the virus can get into chickens.
*  In some cases, it causes mild illness.
*  That's what's known as low pathogenic avian influenza.
*  But sometimes the virus mutates and evolves, and it can become extremely contagious and
*  extremely fatal in poultry.
*  Okay, so the virus comes through wild birds, but gets into farms like this, as you're
*  describing.
*  How have farms traditionally handled outbreaks when they do happen?
*  Well, because this threat isn't new, there is a pretty well-established playbook for
*  containing outbreaks.
*  It's sometimes known as stamping out.
*  And brutally, what it means is killing the birds.
*  So the virus is so deadly in this highly pathogenic form that it's sort of destined to kill all
*  the birds on a farm anyway once it gets in.
*  So the response has traditionally been to proactively depopulate or cull all the birds
*  so it doesn't have a chance to spread.
*  So that's pretty costly for farmers.
*  It is, although the US has a program where it will reimburse farmers for their losses.
*  The way these reimbursements work is they will reimburse farmers only for the birds
*  that are proactively culled and not for those who die naturally from the virus.
*  And the thinking behind that is it's a way to incentivize farmers to report outbreaks
*  early.
*  So, okay, lots of chickens are killed in a way to manage these outbreaks.
*  So we know how to deal with them.
*  But what about now?
*  Tell me about this new strain.
*  So this new version of the virus, it emerged in 2020.
*  After the deadly outbreak of the novel coronavirus, the authorities have now confirmed an outbreak
*  of the H5N1 strain of influenza, a kind of bird flu.
*  And pretty quickly it became clear that a couple things set it apart.
*  A bald eagle found dead at Carvens Cove has tested positive for the highly contagious
*  bird flu.
*  This virus, for whatever reason, seemed very good at infecting all sorts of wild birds
*  that we don't normally associate with bird flu.
*  He was kind of stepping and then falling over and using its wing to right itself.
*  Things like eagles and condors and pelicans.
*  We've just lost a parliament of owls in Minneapolis.
*  Yeah, a couple high profile nests.
*  And also in the past, wild birds have not traditionally gotten very sick from this virus.
*  And this version of the virus not only spread widely through the wild bird population, but
*  it proved to be devastating.
*  The washing up along the east coast of the country from Scotland down to Suffolk.
*  We were hearing about mass die-offs of seabirds in Europe by the hundreds and the thousands.
*  And the bodies of the dead dot the island wherever you look.
*  Wow.
*  Okay, so then as we know, this strain, like previous ones, makes its way from wild animals
*  to farmed animals, namely to chickens.
*  But it's even more deadly.
*  Absolutely.
*  And in fact, it has already caused the worst bird flu outbreak in US history.
*  So more than 90 million birds in the US have died as a result of this virus.
*  90 million birds.
*  Yes.
*  And I should be clear that that represents two things.
*  So some of those birds are birds who naturally got infected and died from the virus.
*  But the vast majority of them are birds that were proactively culled.
*  What it adds up to is 90 million farmed birds in the US have died since this virus emerged.
*  And it's not just a chicken problem.
*  Another thing that has been kind of weird about this virus is it has jumped into other
*  kinds of farms.
*  It is the first time we've seen a bird flu virus jump into US livestock.
*  It's now been reported on a number of dairy farms across eight US states.
*  And that's just something that's totally unprecedented.
*  So it's showing up at dairy farms now.
*  You're saying that bird flu has now spread to cows.
*  How did that happen?
*  So we don't know exactly how cows were first infected.
*  But most scientists' best guess is that maybe an infected wild bird that was migrating
*  shed the virus into some cattle feed or a pasture or a pond and cattle picked it up.
*  The good news is they don't seem to get nearly as sick as chickens do.
*  They are generally making full recoveries on their own in a couple of weeks.
*  OK, so no mass culling of cows.
*  No, that doesn't seem to be necessary at this point.
*  But the bad news is that it's starting to look like we're seeing this virus spread from
*  cow to cow.
*  We don't know exactly how that's happening yet.
*  But any time you see cow to cow or mammal to mammal transmission, that's a big concern.
*  And why is that exactly?
*  Well there are a bunch of reasons.
*  First, it could allow the outbreak to get much bigger, much faster, which might increase
*  the risk to the food supply.
*  And we might also expect it to increase the risk to farm workers, people who might be
*  in contact with these sick cows.
*  Right now, the likelihood that a farmer who gets this virus passes it on is pretty low.
*  But any time you see mammal to mammal transmission, it increases the chance that the virus will
*  adapt and possibly maybe one day get good at spreading between humans.
*  To be clear, that's not something that there's any evidence of happening in cows right now.
*  But the fact that there's any cow to cow transmission happening at all is enough to have scientists
*  a bit concerned.
*  And then if we sort of think more expansively beyond what's happening on farms, there's
*  another big danger lurking out there.
*  And that's what happens when this virus gets into wild animals.
*  Vast populations that we can't control.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Emily, you said that another threat was the threat of flu in wild animal populations.
*  Clearly, of course, it's already in wild birds.
*  Where else has it gone?
*  The reason it's become such a threat is because of how widespread it's become in wild birds.
*  So they keep reintroducing it to wild animal populations pretty much anywhere they go.
*  So we've seen the virus repeatedly pop up in all sorts of animals that you might figure
*  would eat a wild bird.
*  So foxes, bobcats, bears.
*  We actually saw it in a polar bear, raccoons.
*  So a lot of carnivores and scavengers, the thinking is that these animals sort of might
*  stumble across a sick or dead bird, eat it and contract the virus that way.
*  But we're also seeing it show up in some more surprising places, too.
*  We've seen the virus in a bottlenose dolphin of all places.
*  And most devastatingly, we've seen enormous outbreaks in other sorts of marine mammals,
*  especially sea lions and seals.
*  So elephant seals in particular in South America were just devastated by this virus last fall.
*  My colleague, Apoorva Mendevili and I were talking to some scientists in South America
*  who described to us what they called a scene from hell of walking out onto a beach in Argentina
*  that is normally crowded with chaotic, living, breathing, breeding elephant seals and the
*  beach just being covered by carcass after carcass after carcass.
*  Mostly carcasses of young newborn pups.
*  The virus seemed to have a mortality rate of 95% in these elephant seal pups.
*  And they estimated that it might have killed more than 17,000 of the pups that were born
*  last year.
*  So almost the entire new generation of this colony.
*  These are scientists that have studied these seals for decades and they said they've never
*  seen anything like it before.
*  And why is it so far reaching, Emily?
*  What explains these mass die-offs?
*  There are probably a few explanations.
*  One is just how much virus is out there in the environment being shed by wild birds into
*  water and onto beaches.
*  These are also places that viruses like this haven't been before.
*  So it's reaching elephant seals and sea lions in South America that have no prior immunity.
*  There's also the fact that these particular species, these sea lions and seals tend to
*  breed in these huge colonies all crowded together on beaches.
*  And so what that means is if a virus makes its way into the colony, it's very conducive
*  conditions for it to spread.
*  And scientists think that that's actually what's happening now.
*  That it's not just that all these seals are picking up the virus from individual birds,
*  but that they're actually passing it to each other.
*  So basically this virus is spreading to places it's never been before, kind of virgin snow
*  territory where animals just don't have the immunity against it.
*  And once it gets into a population packed on a beach, say, of elephant seals, it's just
*  like a knife through butter.
*  Absolutely.
*  And an even more extreme example of that is what we're starting to see happen in Antarctica,
*  where there's never been a bird flu outbreak before until last fall for the first time
*  this virus reached the Antarctic mainland.
*  And we are now seeing the virus move through colonies of not only seabirds and seals, but
*  penguin colonies, which have not been exposed to these viruses before.
*  And it's too soon to say what the toll will be, but penguins also, of course, are known
*  for breeding in these large colonies.
*  Right.
*  Probably don't have many immune defenses against this virus and of course are facing all these
*  other environmental threats.
*  And so there's a lot of fear that you add on the stress of a bird flu virus and it could
*  just be a tipping point for penguins.
*  Emily, at this point, I'm kind of wondering why more people aren't talking about this.
*  I mean, I didn't know any of this before having this conversation with you, and it feels pretty
*  worrying.
*  Well, a lot of experts and scientists are talking about this with rising alarm.
*  And in terms that are quite stark, they're talking about the virus spreading through
*  wild animal populations so quickly and so ferociously that they're calling it an ecological
*  disaster.
*  But that's a disaster that sometimes seems distant from us, both geographically.
*  We're talking about things that are happening maybe at the tip of Argentina or in Antarctica.
*  And also from our concerns of our everyday lives.
*  What's happening in penguins might not seem like it has a lot to do with the price of
*  a carton of eggs at the grocery store.
*  But I think that we should be paying a lot of attention to how this virus is moving through
*  animal populations, how quickly it's moving through animal populations, and the opportunities
*  that it is giving the virus to evolve into something that poses a much bigger threat
*  to human health.
*  So the way it's spreading in wild animals, even in remote places like Antarctica, that's
*  important to watch, at least in part because there's a real danger to people here.
*  So we know that the virus can infect humans, and that generally it's not very good at
*  spreading between humans.
*  But the concern all along has been that if this virus has more opportunities to spread
*  between mammals, it will get better at spreading between them.
*  And that seems to be what is happening in seals and sea lions.
*  Scientists are already seeing evidence that the virus is adapting as it passes from marine
*  mammal to marine mammal.
*  And that could turn it into a virus that's also better at spreading between people.
*  And if somebody walks out onto a beach and touches a dead sea lion, if their dog starts
*  playing with a sea lion carcass, you could imagine that this virus could make its way
*  out of marine mammals and into the human population.
*  And if it's this mammalian adapted version of the virus that makes its way out, that
*  could be a bigger threat to human health.
*  So the sheer number of hosts that this disease has, the more opportunity it has to mutate,
*  and the more chance it has to mutate in a way that would actually be dangerous for people.
*  Yes, and in particular, the more mammalian hosts.
*  So that gives the virus many more opportunities to become a specialist in mammals instead
*  of a specialist in birds, which is what it is right now.
*  Right.
*  I like that, a specialist in mammals.
*  So what can we do to contain this virus?
*  Well, scientists are exploring new options.
*  There's been a lot of discussion about whether we should start vaccinating chickens in the
*  U.S.
*  The government, USDA labs have been testing some poultry vaccines.
*  It's probably scientifically feasible.
*  There are challenges there, both in terms of logistics, just how would you go about
*  vaccinating billions of chickens every year?
*  There are also trade questions.
*  Traditionally, a lot of countries have not been willing to accept poultry products from
*  countries that vaccinate their poultry.
*  And there's concern about whether the virus might spread undetected in flocks that are
*  vaccinated.
*  So as we saw with COVID, the vaccine can sometimes stop you from getting sick, but it doesn't
*  necessarily stop infection.
*  And so countries are worried they might unknowingly import products that are harboring the virus.
*  And what about among wild animals?
*  I mean, how do you even begin to get your head around that?
*  Yeah, I mean, thinking about vaccinating wild animals maybe makes vaccinating all the chickens
*  in the U.S.
*  look easy.
*  There has been some discussion of limited vaccination campaigns, but that's not feasible
*  on a global scale.
*  So unfortunately, the bottom line is there isn't a good way to stop spread in wild animals.
*  We can try to protect some vulnerable populations, but we're not going to stop the circulation
*  of this virus.
*  So Emily, we started this conversation with a kind of curiosity that the Daily had about
*  the price of eggs.
*  And then you explained the bird flu to us.
*  And then somehow we ended up learning about an ecological disaster that's unfolding all
*  around us and potentially the source of the next human pandemic.
*  That is pretty scary.
*  It is scary and it's easy to get overwhelmed by it.
*  And I feel like I should take a step back and say none of this is inevitable.
*  None of this is necessarily happening tomorrow.
*  But this is why scientists are concerned and why they think it's really important to keep
*  a very close eye on what's happening both on farms and off farms as this virus spreads
*  through all sorts of animal populations.
*  One thing that comes up again and again and again in my interviews with people who have
*  been studying bird flu for decades is how this virus never stops surprising them.
*  And sometimes those are bad surprises like these elephant seal die-offs, the incursions
*  into dairy cattle.
*  But there are some encouraging signs that have emerged recently.
*  We're starting to see some early evidence that some of the bird populations that survived
*  sort of early brushes with this virus might be developing some immunity.
*  So that's something that maybe could help slow the spread of this virus in animal populations.
*  We just don't entirely know how this is going to play out.
*  Flu is a very difficult wily foe and so that's one reason scientists are trying to keep such
*  a close attentive eye on what's happening.
*  Emily, thank you.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On this vote, the yeas are 366 and the nays are 58.
*  The bill is passed.
*  On Saturday, in four back-to-back votes, the House voted resoundingly to approve a long-stalled
*  package of aid to Ukraine, Israel and other American allies, delivering a major victory
*  to President Biden, who made aid to Ukraine one of his top priorities.
*  On this vote, the yeas are 385 and the nos are 34, with one answering present.
*  The bill is passed without objection.
*  The House passed the component parts of the $95 billion package, which included a bill
*  that could result in a nationwide ban of TikTok.
*  On this vote, the yeas are 311 and the nays are 112.
*  The bill is passed.
*  Oh!
*  One voting present.
*  I missed it, but thank you.
*  In a remarkable breach of custom, Democrats stepped in to supply the crucial votes to
*  push the legislation past hardline Republican opposition and bring it to the floor.
*  The House will be in order.
*  The Senate is expected to pass the legislation as early as Tuesday.
*  Today's episode was produced by Ricky Nowetzki, Nina Feldman, Eric Krupke and Alex Stern.
