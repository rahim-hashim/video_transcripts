*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro. This is Adelaide.
*  We have some news from within our Fox family.
*  Less than a week after Fox News reached a historic settlement in a defamation lawsuit.
*  Fox News media and Tucker Carlson have mutually agreed to heartways.
*  The network has abruptly fired Tucker Carlson, an anchor at the center of that case.
*  We want to thank Tucker Carlson for his service to the network as host and prior to that as a long-term contributor.
*  Today, my colleague Jeremy Peters on exactly why Fox is cutting ties with its biggest star and what Fox will be without him.
*  It's Tuesday, April 25th.
*  Jeremy, you're back very soon.
*  Sooner than perhaps, sooner than perhaps you wanted.
*  Sooner than I think anyone might have expected.
*  It is 6.26pm on Monday night and four blocks away from here, Jeremy.
*  Over at the headquarters of Fox News, there is a mad scramble going on right now because there will be no Tucker Carlson tonight at 8pm as it is always aired because Tucker Carlson has been fired.
*  I just want to begin by having you put that piece of news into perspective for us as somebody who covers Fox, covers the entire conservative media world.
*  How big a moment this is.
*  It's an earthquake. Tucker Carlson was one of these rare media figures whose power transcended what he could say to his audience because he not only spoke to them,
*  but he could speak to the people in power in the highest places of American government.
*  And that included for a time the president of the United States, Donald Trump.
*  Right, they corresponded, meaningfully and regularly.
*  And Tucker could have an influence on the president when he wanted his ear, he could have it.
*  Because Tucker Carlson spoke the language of Trump supporters more intuitively than almost anyone in conservative media.
*  And that allowed him to become one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful host on television.
*  And now he's gone.
*  And we're going to get to why he's gone in just a moment or why we think he has gone.
*  But talk to us about how once he had this show, Tucker Carlson became this powerful force that you're describing and that has made his departure the earthquake that you just called it before Donald Trump bursts onto the political scene.
*  Tucker Carlson is not a terribly influential person in conservative politics.
*  I mean, he's the weekend anchor at Fox.
*  Wow, which is we should say for those who don't obsess about ratings on cable news, not at all for stitches.
*  It's kind of a oblivion role.
*  Yeah, I believe there's a Simpson's joke about this where Kent Brockman, the anchor gets upset one day and storms off and says, I don't care. Call the weekend guy.
*  Okay, so he's not yet.
*  Tucker Carlson, as we know him.
*  Right, but the Trump presidency proved to be the biggest stroke of luck in his career yet his ability to speak to the Trump voter to their grievances, their anxieties about the way they see their purchase on power in American society slipping away.
*  That is what his gift is and that allows him to connect with the audience in a way that Fox says, okay, wow, we're going to give you an 8 p.m. slot.
*  Very prestigious.
*  It's the marquee slot. It was the slot that Bill O'Reilly used to hold when he was at Fox News and was there number one host before he got fired.
*  And once Tucker Carlson has this prestigious platform of 8 p.m. Fox News, what does he do with it and what makes that formula works so well?
*  It's one of displacement.
*  The theme is, and this is especially resonant with a lot of the older white male parts of Tucker Carlson's audience, you are not wrong to feel agreed.
*  Demographic change is the key to the Democratic Party's political ambitions.
*  In order to win and maintain power, Democrats plan to change the population of the country.
*  You are not wrong to think that there is an elite driven plot to replace you.
*  So every time they import a new voter, I become disenfranchised as a current voter and replace your standing in society with people who do not look like you.
*  Immigration is a means to electoral advantage. It is about power.
*  People who are brown, who are coming across a border.
*  The Democratic Party coddles the mob UCNTV, our elites fund the Democratic Party. That's how it works.
*  People who are black, who are marching in the streets demanding social justice, racial justice reform.
*  Black Lives Matter, limit.
*  Exactly. It's very much rooted in a sense of loss.
*  This loss that many Americans felt in their own prestige in American society.
*  Why should I sit back and take that? The power that I have is an American guaranteed at birth is one man, one vote, and they're deluding it.
*  No, they're not allowed to do that.
*  Right. This has a name. It's called the Great Replacement Theory.
*  Yes. And it's been around forever. Tucker Carlson isn't the first to come up with it and to fan fears over it.
*  But he is the most prominent figure in American media to do so to this day.
*  No one had gone up to this line and crossed it the way Tucker Carlson did.
*  Now, I know that the left and all the little gatekeepers on Twitter become literally hysterical if you use the term replacement, if you suggest.
*  The Democratic Party is trying to replace the current electorate, the voters now casting ballots, with new people, more obedient voters from the third world.
*  But they become hysterical because that's what's happening actually. Let's just say it, that's true.
*  But he's not just talking about how people of color are a threat to white men.
*  He's obsessed with this threat that he sees coming from within.
*  This idea that American men in general are becoming weak and soft.
*  So there is a huge health crisis in this country ongoing.
*  Has been for decades is getting no attention. It's affecting everything else. And it has to with testosterone levels.
*  He describes this, quote, total collapse of testosterone levels in American men.
*  So we looked into this for a documentary for Tucker Carlson original series called The End of Men.
*  And he does an entire special on this supposed assault on masculinity in this country.
*  Think the solutions are actually pretty simple. Exposure self to red light therapy. There's a massive amount of it.
*  It's just testicle tanning.
*  He even talks to an expert who recommended getting your testicles tanned in order to boost testosterone levels.
*  So obviously half the viewers right now are like, what? That's testicle tanning. That's crazy.
*  But my view is, OK, testosterone levels crash and nobody says anything about it. That's crazy.
*  So why is it crazy to seek solutions?
*  So Jeremy, this framework as oddball and at times racist as it may seem is powerfully resonating with Fox viewers.
*  Can you quantify just how powerfully it's connecting with them?
*  So Carlson quickly becomes the most watched host on the network, which is the most watched news network in the country.
*  That's exactly right. At times it's even the most watched cable network period.
*  So he gets an average of three million viewers a night, sometimes more, sometimes less, you know, kind of depending on the news cycle at the time.
*  Now when you compare that to the competition, this is leaps and bounds ahead.
*  Over on CNN, Anderson Cooper is getting maybe around a million viewers a night.
*  About a third of what Tucker Carlson is getting.
*  Yes. And this is why Tucker Carlson starts to amass incredible power and influence, not just with President Trump, but with governors and state legislators all across the country.
*  And what are some examples of that power?
*  He basically uses his show to brow beat these elected officials into doing and enacting the policies that he wants to see.
*  Greg Abbott is a governor of one of our most important states, maybe the most important state actually.
*  So take Texas governor Greg Abbott, for example.
*  Governor Abbott, thank you very much for coming on.
*  One night Carlson goes on his show and grills Abbott.
*  I have a military force I command is called the National Guard. We're going to block the border and save the country.
*  Why didn't you do that? Why aren't you doing that now?
*  Why haven't you used the state's National Guard to stop all these migrants from crossing the border?
*  Well, lo and behold, Texas governor Greg Abbott sending 400 more National Guard troops to the El Paso border in an attempt to block the flow of migrants into the US.
*  Abbott later says he'll do just that. He sends in the Texas National Guard to the border.
*  I mean, I just want to pause and we've talked about that incident on the show.
*  We actually spoke to a member of the National Guard in Texas about it.
*  What a big deal it is to mobilize your National Guard.
*  I mean, in this case, mobilize your National Guard to act as a kind of like border patrol.
*  And that is being prompted not by an outcry from voters or an order from the president,
*  but by a cable news anchor suggesting it. That's power.
*  Indeed it is. Here's another Florida governor.
*  Ron DeSantis is taking credit for flying two planes carrying dozens of migrants to Martha's Vineyard.
*  Florida governor Ron DeSantis sends migrants to Martha's Vineyard in this stunt to say,
*  okay, blue states, see, this is what it's like. You deal with these people.
*  Many did not know where they were going and local officials on the island were not given any advanced notice of the flight's arrival.
*  That was Tucker Carlson's idea.
*  As of 2019, only 3% of all people, all residents in Egrotown were born outside of this country.
*  They are begging for more diversity. Why not send migrants there?
*  In huge numbers.
*  Earlier on his show, he said that residents of Martha's Vineyard, who are almost all Democrats,
*  are quote, begging for more diversity. Why not send migrants there?
*  Well, that's what DeSantis did.
*  So over and over again, the words come out of Tucker Carlson's mouth and these powerful governors obediently do what he's asking for,
*  which is, as opposed to a measure of their fear, that if they don't, his audience will come and punish them with the balls.
*  That's exactly right. They know to be on the wrong side of Tucker Carlson and one of his issues is to risk incurring the wrath of the conservative voter.
*  No one knows this better than Kevin McCarthy, the speaker of the house, who almost wasn't the speaker of the house because conservatives like Tucker Carlson told their followers that he was too cozy with the elite ruling class in business and politics.
*  So to play Kate Carlson, McCarthy gives him 40,000 hours of previously unseen footage from the security tapes that were running on January 6th.
*  Right. A kind of unprecedented disclosure to a single journalist.
*  And one that many Democrats pointed out risked a real security breach by disclosing certain aspects of capital security that weren't known to the public.
*  And Carlson takes this footage and edits it down to a handful of incidents where you can see the people who had illegally broken into the capital walking around peacefully, looking as if they might be on just a leisurely tour.
*  And he says, see, they told you that this was a violent mob, but it's not. And in fact, many of these people just kind of innocently ambled into the capital.
*  And in a trick that he has tried time and time again on his show, he says, I'm telling you the truth about what happened here.
*  And the mainstream liberal media are the ones who are lying to you and you can't believe them here. See it for yourself, which is not accurate in this case.
*  But the scale of influence we're talking about here is the envy of the cable news industry.
*  I mean, other hosts at other networks, they might not like what Tucker Carlson is doing, but they no doubt wish they had that kind of influence they wish they had his ratings.
*  And by all accounts, Fox had no problem with what Tucker Carlson was doing for years and years and years, even when advertisers would get upset, which they sometimes did, they would boycott the show.
*  It was all okay, right? Correct me if I'm wrong. Until now. Yeah, that's absolutely right.
*  They knew they had the number one prime time show in cable news. They had a reliable revenue stream, not just from advertisers that was you correctly point out a lot of them boycott it, but from the enormous fees that Fox News is able to generate from subscribers to cable.
*  The breaking point seems to come this year as Fox News is defending itself against lawsuits where Tucker Carlson's conduct off air is far more problematic for the network than what he said on the air.
*  And that's what we think pushed his bosses to pull the trigger on his firing so suddenly this week.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Jimmy describe this off air conduct that's revealed in these lawsuits that appears to have contributed to Tucker Carlson's firing.
*  So as of 6 p.m. tonight, there's still a lot we don't know about why he got fired. We do know that it was ordered from the highest levels of Fox and that Lockland Murdoch, who's the CEO of Fox Corporation and Suzanne Scott, the CEO of Fox News decided that they were going to do this on Friday night.
*  They inform Tucker of it on Monday morning telling him you're not on the air tonight.
*  No chance to say goodbye. It's over.
*  In fact, in their news release announcing this Fox says his last show was Friday. His last show was in the past. It's pretty unsentimental.
*  Okay, so back to the last words and the off air comments that have perhaps led us to this point.
*  First, let's start with the Dominion case. The biggest revelation about Tucker Carlson to come out of the Dominion case is that he reveals himself to be something of a political performance artist.
*  He's telling his audience one thing, but because of the emails and texts that Dominion is able to get as part of the case, we know he doesn't believe some of the stuff that he's allowing on his air or telling his viewers that they're right to believe about voter fraud.
*  Right. Much of it relating to the claims that there's election fraud or that Dominion's voting machines played a role in election fraud.
*  We know he didn't believe any of it.
*  We also know from the Dominion suit that he loads former president Trump.
*  He calls him all sorts of names. Questions as judgment says he can't wait for the day when they no longer have to talk about Trump and can ignore him.
*  And this is the president Tucker Carlson has spent years elevating promoting and cheering on the president who from what you're saying is responsible for his success as a TV anchor.
*  Exactly. So that I think kind of points to his disingenuousness that he's going to tell his audience what he thinks they want to hear.
*  And it paid off because he's the most popular prime time host on all of Fox News right by these emails and text suddenly shake the foundation of that success.
*  They shattered the premise for those who were paying attention and we're not sure many Fox viewers were that he is this pro working class champion of president Trump.
*  But we can assume that people who won Fox News were paying attention to this lawsuit and to the emails.
*  They were and I'm told that they were also paying attention to some of the text messages between Tucker and his producers in which they make fun of their colleagues and they even question the judgment of their bosses.
*  What's an example of that from the Dominion lawsuit where Tucker Carlson and his producers are challenging their superiors.
*  They really take issue with the Arizona call.
*  This is when the decision desk at Fox News got out of the gates earlier than any other news organization to say president Biden's going to win Arizona.
*  Right. And that was a huge moment because after that it became very, very difficult to see how Trump could win a second term.
*  Carlson says effectively I can't believe these people don't they understand the damage that they're doing to this brand we spent years building.
*  And he accuses some of them of being liberal sellouts people who hate us he says even though they are his colleagues and bosses that is correct.
*  The lawsuit from Dominion also opens a window into another aspect of his behavior that is alarming to many at Fox, which is.
*  His misogynistic, especially the vulgar way in which he uses misogynistic language.
*  He says some words I won't repeat here referring to Sidney Powell when a president Trump's legal advisors that made people shudder once they saw them.
*  That leads to a second lawsuit that unfolds as the Dominion case is getting ready to go to trial.
*  Talk about this other lawsuit Abby Grossberg's lawsuit.
*  A producer at Fox News, Seuss Fox and Carlson alleging that he has created presided over this incredibly toxic workplace.
*  Women were objectified female politicians who came on the show were mocked. It was a game. It was a sport where discrimination, sexism, anti-semitism is all tolerated in a part of the everyday culture at Tucker Carlson.
*  She talks about a photo pinned up to a wall in the Tucker Carlson tonight offices of Nancy Pelosi in this plunging bathing suit.
*  This producer also alleges that right before Tudor Dixon, the Republican candidate for governor in Michigan, is set to come on Tucker Carlson's show they have a mock debate about whether they would prefer to have sex with the public.
*  They prefer to have sex with her Dixon or her Democratic opponent, Governor Gretchen Whitmer.
*  So with the second lawsuit, we're talking about some very serious allegations, some very detailed allegations of basically a sexist hostile workplace and the kind of claim that I have to imagine in a post-Roger ails Fox News.
*  Right one where the company has already fired a senior executive for sexual harassment that this stuff gets taken pretty seriously.
*  It does. And part of Suzanne Scott's mission once she took the helm of Fox News from Roger ails was to make it a more friendly place for women to work.
*  So it's not exactly a good look for her to have her star host and his staff behaving really horribly toward women.
*  Right. So Jimmy, how based on all your reporting does everything we're describing here come together in the minds of Fox leadership in their decision to get rid of Tucker Carlson because there's a lot here in the mix.
*  So how do you see it?
*  If you look at the history of recent high profile firings of Fox News, Roger ails as you just talked about he was fired after being exposed as a serial predator of women.
*  Bill O'Reilly, it's number one host, fire after multiple women accused him of egregious sexual misconduct.
*  Their firings didn't have anything to do with what was said on the air what they allowed on their shows.
*  And I think that's important in putting into context what happened to Tucker Carlson for four years during Trump's presidency and for two years after Tucker Carlson said some outrageously inflammatory racially insensitive outright at times racist things.
*  And he still had a job even when the dominion lawsuit is unfolding and we see how he privately talked about President Trump and insulted his colleagues at Fox.
*  Fox doesn't fire him then they fire him after we learn that the workplace he was in charge of was a human resources nightmare and had already spawn one lawsuit and very well could have led to more that we just said.
*  Interesting so if I can summarize what you're saying here what gets you in trouble at a place like Fox which is so fixated on its ratings and its audience is always at the end of the day not going too far with that pursuit of ratings and that pursuit of audience but with plain old human resource violations of the most basic kind.
*  That's exactly right. But the big question around firing Tucker Carlson is is it going to hurt Fox and maybe their rationale makes total sense maybe their lawyers advise them that they needed to do it.
*  But as Tucker Carlson said in one of the text messages that you've talked to me about on this show when your Fox you cannot alienate your viewers that relationship is sacrosanct and it is delicate.
*  In firing Tucker is Fox at all risking disrupting that bond with its viewers.
*  They are but at the same time they're making a gamble that is paid off for them in the past.
*  Tucker Carlson is in the first high profile figure at Fox who's been fired right below rally Glenn Beck the Tea Party star and Glenn Beck sin along with Sarah Palin's was also fired by Fox as a contributor right there since.
*  Their sins were that they thought they were bigger than Fox. Fox wants these hosts to know that no one is ever bigger than the network itself.
*  Tucker Carlson thought he was bigger than the network. This is a guy remember was floated as a possible presidential contender.
*  He's quoted on the record saying that no one tells him what to do. He can put whatever he wants essentially into his scripts.
*  Well what Fox News said on Monday is no you're not bigger than Fox. Here's the door and by the way you are only who you are because we gave you that apm timeslot.
*  I'm pretty confident and history has shown that they can put.
*  A relatively unknown untested person into that very highly rated slot and it'll probably do well because there's just so many people who watch Fox and Fox is so good.
*  At giving its audience what it wants it doesn't necessarily have to be Tucker Carlson in the anchor chair doing that right the lesson here being from Fox.
*  We can make you and we can break you and then we can replace you and do the whole thing all over again.
*  And that is something that the Murdoch's have always shown they are not afraid of doing so if we know that there's a Fox without Tucker Carlson.
*  Guess the question becomes is there a Tucker Carlson without Fox.
*  Well as is usually the case with multi million dollar contracts like he has there's a non compete.
*  So he will have restrictions on what he is able to do and it may preclude any type of television for quite some time.
*  That doesn't mean that he's done but you know in the case of Glenn back in Bill O'Reilly.
*  You don't really hear much about them anymore. I mean yes they have shows they have followings the loyal die hearts who always tuned in when they were on Fox.
*  But that's a much smaller audience now.
*  Right. It's a good lesson for every journalist out there. What are you without the platform of your news organization.
*  That's the lesson here. It's very humbling.
*  Well Jeremy once again in a very short week. Thank you for your time. We appreciate it.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  We'll do it back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today on Monday the Republican governor of North Dakota signed a law that will be
*  on Monday.
*  The Republican governor of North Dakota signed a law that will ban almost all abortions after the state's highest court blocked a previous ban from going into effect there last month.
*  The law makes North Dakota a lot of money.
*  Monday the Republican governor of North Dakota signed a law that will ban almost all abortions after the state's highest court blocked a previous ban from going into effect there last month.
*  The law makes North Dakota the 14th state where abortion is currently banned or nearly banned.
*  And in yet another major media firing CNN has pushed out Don Lemon, a star anchor and co-host of the network's flagship morning show following on air comments he made in February that were widely criticized as sexist.
*  Lemon had claimed that women like Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley were no longer in their prime after their 20s and 30s.
*  He later apologized but the Times reports that lemon standing fell with both CNN's audience and potential guests leading to his ouster.
