*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro. This is it, Ailey.
*  Today, ever since Republicans won a razor-thin majority in the House of Representatives
*  last year, there have been predictions that a small group of far-right members would
*  make the chamber ungovernable. Over the past few weeks, that prediction has proven
*  correct. My colleague, Annie Karney, explains.
*  It's Tuesday, June 27.
*  Annie, it is very nice to see you and welcome back.
*  Thank you for having me. Happy to be here.
*  We wanted to talk to you because over the past couple of weeks, something started happening
*  in Congress that we wanted to better understand. Lawmakers from both parties, Democrats,
*  Republicans, had just passed this big last-minute deal to avoid a US financial default on its
*  debt, everybody breathed a sigh of relief, and then right after that, strange things
*  started to happen within the Republican-controlled House. Pick up the story there and tell
*  us about that.
*  What's been happening is that over the last few weeks, Kevin McCarthy, the Speaker of
*  the House, has basically lost control of his chamber. After he cut the debt ceiling
*  deal with President Biden, he received a lot of blowback from far-right members of his
*  conference, the Freedom Caucus, who are livid that he didn't follow through on promise
*  as he made to them, specifically on spending cuts, and basically feel like they got rolled
*  at this whole process. They're aware that they have a ton of power in this dynamic of
*  the House, where there is a four-seat majority, and they think they have a power-sharing agreement
*  with Kevin McCarthy. After that debt deal, where they feel like they were sold out, they
*  use that power to get back at Speaker of McCarthy.
*  And how do they get back at him?
*  They could have tried to get rid of him, call the snap-vote on the House floor to remove
*  him as Speaker. They chose not to do that. Instead, they did something that's arguably
*  more painful and could be a more ongoing torture of the Speaker.
*  And what is that painful ongoing torture?
*  What these far-right members of the House did was they shut down the floor of the House.
*  On June 6, they create this blockade that makes it impossible for Republicans to bring a
*  bill to the floor for a vote.
*  Well, just explain that. I mean, how do you blockade the House floor?
*  This gets a little in the weeds, but it's fascinating.
*  For a bill to get a vote on the floor, first, the House has to pass a rule.
*  Typically, no one pays attention to a rule vote. It's just a procedural measure.
*  And it's just a party-line vote. So the edage is vote party on the rule, vote your conscience
*  on the bill.
*  But what happened here was these far-right members who wanted to block the floor voted with
*  Democrats to bring down the rule. If the rule doesn't pass, the bill can't come to the
*  floor.
*  So, we'd Republicans vote with Democrats. That's very unexpected.
*  In order to knock down the rule vote in order to then keep anything from being introduced
*  on the floor.
*  Yes. And that completely freezes the floor. That means that they are standing in the way
*  of the Republican agenda. And it's at a standstill. McCarthy had meetings all day with these
*  members who are on strike, basically. And at the end of the day, they ended up canceling
*  a whole week of floor action and basically sending people home because there was no agreement.
*  So how's the Republicans decide to punish their own leader by making it impossible for
*  anything to happen on the House floor, including anything by their own party? I assume they're
*  just shutting it down.
*  That's right.
*  So how does this blockade end?
*  The way the blockade ends is not with some big agreement that means this will never happen
*  again. The blockade ends on the terms of the Freedom Caucus members. They ended because
*  there was a bill they felt very passionate about and needed to pass. It was a gun related,
*  conservative issue that they really liked. So they ended it on their terms and they made
*  it very clear they weren't removing this threat that they can shut down the House floor
*  for a day a week as long as they want.
*  Okay.
*  That's the first major episode in this post debt ceiling. I guess we could call it mutiny
*  by hard right house Republicans and very much undermines Speaker McCarthy's authority.
*  So what happens next?
*  What happens next is they find another way to disobey McCarthy and sort of disrupt his control
*  of the floor, which is by using something that's known as a privileged resolution. This
*  is a tool that any member can use that basically allows you to introduce a resolution and it
*  goes around the speaker. It bypasses any committee work and floor schedule that the leadership
*  controls and it just allows you to bring this resolution directly to the floor.
*  Right because normally a resolution has to go through a series of bureaucratic steps,
*  basically an approval process before it gets anywhere near the House floor. But you're saying that
*  this thing called a privileged resolution allows a House member to basically skip all those steps,
*  go rogue. And I'm guessing that this tool has been around for a while, but that its use is deeply
*  frowned upon. This has been around for a while, yes. And McCarthy has pleaded with his members.
*  Don't use these to try and control the agenda on the floor. He said to them part of what we
*  agreed during the Fraud Speaker's race was a return to regular order. This is not regular order.
*  Regular order means going through committees. It doesn't mean just bringing up something on your own
*  that you want to do and forcing a vote on it. But a lot of these please, he does in these conference
*  meetings every week and really fall in deaf ears. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2A1 of rule 9,
*  I seek recognition to give notice of my intent to raise a question of privileges of the House.
*  So on June 13th, a Republican lawmaker named Anna Polina Luna, she's a freshman from Florida,
*  part of the Freedom Conquest, uses one of these privileged resolutions to try and censure Adam
*  Schiff. And thanks that representative Schiff lied, made representations and abuse sensitive
*  information. Adam Schiff is the former Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who
*  gained a lot of fame and hatred on the right because he was the lead prosecutor in Trump's first
*  impeachment trial. Right. So he's long been a Republican political target. But now Luna decides
*  that she wants to censure him for conduct that misleads the American people in a way that is not
*  for falsely claiming that there is evidence of collusion between Trump campaign and Russia and
*  the first impeachment. And she decides to find him $16 million. $16 million. Wow. A figure she says
*  she comes up with because it's half the cost of what that impeachment trial cost.
*  And the Committee on Ethics shall conduct an investigation into representative Adam Schiff's lies,
*  misrepresentations and abuses of sensitive information.
*  Okay. Wow. And just as a reminder, Annie, a censure is a rare and a very public form of
*  review. It's kind of like an official scolding from Congress. And here you're saying that already
*  severe measure, it sounds like it's being paired with a very severe financial find that might
*  bankrupt your average Congress person. Yeah. For sure. The House has only censured two other people
*  in the last two decades. And these were for much more concrete and serious issues. They censored
*  Paul Gosar, Republican from Arizona a few years ago for tweeting out violent depictions of himself
*  striking Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a sword. And then Charlie Wrangel, the former Democratic
*  Congressman from New York was censured for a serious financial and campaign misconduct.
*  Those are the only two examples in the past 20 years. And now this one which really seems to be
*  politically motivated as payback from a Trump loyalist against a person who has long been a political
*  target, especially for Trump. Got it. And what's the reaction from Speaker McCarthy to this
*  resolution, which as you've described it is intended to go around him? Well, even before she
*  brings it up, he is trying to talk around of it. That's what people I spoke with told me. He tries to
*  convince her you're doing shift a huge favor here. You might end up helping elect him to the Senate.
*  He's currently running for California Senate seat. Do this through a committee. Like that's
*  regular order. Don't do this. The other argument they make to her is this doesn't have the votes.
*  They're pretty convinced that she can't pass this, especially with that $16 million fine,
*  which is something that a lot of Republicans actually opposed finding a member of Congress in that
*  manner that she expressed great confidence that she had the votes. She's on the war path.
*  So what happens that day is it actually does fail and it looks like she really miscalculated
*  and lots of I think 20 Republicans voted against it to block the resolution.
*  So as McCarthy has predicted, it doesn't succeed. It doesn't succeed. And this is a little example
*  right here of his laws of control. This is a waste of time on the House floor. It's a bit of
*  embarrassment for the whole team here, including McCarthy. Adam Schiff meanwhile is sending out
*  fundraising email after fundraising email. I'm the number one target. And I heard a lot of
*  hand wringing for moderate Republicans saying we don't like Adam Schiff either. And we're making
*  an in-kind donation to his Senate campaign here. In other words, they felt this was not only a bit
*  of an embarrassing breakdown of the system, but just politically kind of stupid.
*  Politically stupid. So they're frustrated on multiple levels by this ploy.
*  Got it. But Luna is not deterred by this failure. In fact, she tweets out that she's playing
*  four-dimensional chess and this is all part of her grand plan. And McCarthy's House leadership
*  works with her to figure out a way to make this resolution actually work. What that means is
*  dropping the $16 million fine. And then they get behind it. And McCarthy supports it. And she's
*  back on the floor with her privilege resolution to censure Adam Schiff. And this time, the A's are
*  213 and the Nays are 209. It passes long party lines. And they officially do censure a member for
*  the third time in two decades. House will be in order. It was a kind of dramatic moment on the
*  House floor where Democrats started chanting shame, shame, shame from the well. Wow.
*  So thinking back to where we began, McCarthy could not prevent that embarrassing legislative
*  blockade. He couldn't stop the ultimate censoring of Adam Schiff, even though he originally tries to.
*  It sounds like the best he can do in this new world in which far-right Republicans are openly
*  rebelling against him is to kind of guide something that he hates into something that he hates
*  less. So this does not sound like it's going super well for Speaker McCarthy.
*  That's exactly right. The best he can do in these situations is kind of mitigate the damage.
*  And that's what he's done. And he knows every day that his troubles are not behind him and are
*  only probably getting worse. And what happens the same week as the Schiff's center is McCarthy
*  has to do this all over again when another member surprises him with a privileged resolution.
*  And this time the stakes are even higher. We'll break back.
*  So Andy, tell us about this next unpleasant surprise that Speaker McCarthy encounters from his
*  Republican colleagues. The next thing that happens that same week is another member of the far-right
*  freedom caucus. Generalwoman is recognized for six minutes. This time it's Lauren Bobert of Colorado.
*  Mr. Speaker, I rise in today in support of my impeachment bill that will hold Joe Biden accountable
*  for the dereliction of one of his most basic duties. She brings a privileged resolution to the
*  floor. For the first time in 24 years a House Republican led majority is moving forward with impeachment
*  proceedings against a current president. And this time it's introducing articles of impeachment
*  against Joe Biden. She also gives no one a heads up that she's planning to do this. And what grounds
*  does Congresswoman Bobert's site for introducing articles of impeachment? The Biden border crisis
*  and massive wave of illegal immigration has fueled a record-breaking fentanyl crisis.
*  She claims that he deserves to be impeached because he has failed to secure the southern border
*  and that he has knowingly failed to enforce immigration laws. His actions and open borders agenda
*  demonstrate that he has no intention of enforcing our current immigration and border security
*  statutes on the books. She doesn't exactly lay out proof of high crimes and misdemeanors that
*  is typically the bar for impeaching a president. Every member should vote to hold President Joe Biden
*  accountable. Mr. Speaker, I yield. Generalwoman yields back.
*  I mean that's about as big as it gets impeaching a president. She wants to do that without
*  consulting with the Speaker of the House. Yes without going through committees without
*  building a case it's unheard of and most of her colleagues are livid about this and think it's
*  basically like a stunt impeachment. But a lot of Republicans talked about impeaching Biden
*  during the campaign and here she is delivering on that promise. And also strikes me that this
*  feels a lot like the center of Adam Schiff in that it's a privileged resolution that feels like
*  it has a lot to do with avenging the enemies of Donald Trump. It does and it comes on the heels of
*  Trump being indicted by the Justice Department which has Republicans railing against a two-tier
*  justice system. The House is the one branch of government that they still control and so a few of
*  them were decided that this is the most productive way to get back to impeach President Biden.
*  Without a real sense of what crimes he committed. Yes. So what does Speaker McCarthy do in this case?
*  What is his response to this privileged resolution active rebellion? This is a terrible
*  position for him and for most of the members in his conference. McCarthy is very aware that impeachment
*  is unpopular with voters and he tries to convince them that this is not how you do a real impeachment.
*  You don't do it in two days. You build a real case. You present the case to voters to convince
*  them that there were really crimes that need to be prosecuted. He tells them in their closed-door
*  conference meeting, we vote on this. We send this over to the Senate. It has no chance of passage
*  in a Democrat controlled Senate. He kind of tells them like, is this the majority we want to be?
*  If this is how we want to be, we're going to be at two-year majority. We're going to lose control
*  of the House. What does he mean exactly? He means that this looks like a joke. It looks like a
*  political stunt and it doesn't resonate with voters. Voters care about the economy. They care
*  about inflation. They care about the cost of a gallon of milk. Voters want lawmakers looking
*  like they're doing serious work that affects their lives. I think McCarthy is trying to say here,
*  doing a flimsy impeachment where we haven't even laid out the case to voters of why we have proof
*  of high crimes and misdemeanors. That's how you squander your majority. Right. He's saying this is how
*  we lose the next election. This is how a foresee Republican majority becomes a Democratic majority
*  by pulling things like this. He's saying, don't do it. He's saying, don't do it. The problem is
*  some of the people he's saying that to likely don't care if they're in the majority or in the minority.
*  If you think about a bomb thrower or someone who is really not here because they want to
*  legislate but because they want to get attention or disrupt how government works, you can do that
*  from either side. He has a good argument that resonates with a lot of members but a lot of members
*  couldn't care less. Right. I'm guessing Congresswoman Bober is one of those lawmakers who couldn't
*  care less but what does she say in response to this play? Well, she does end up finding a deal with
*  McCarthy which is that they will take a vote which would refer her impeachment articles to two
*  powerful committees, to the Homeland Security Committee and the Judiciary Committee where they
*  will investigate these border issues, these immigration issues and take up the issue of impeachment
*  through a committee. So she gets to save face and say, I got the ball rolling on a Biden impeachment
*  which is something that we've talked about for months. Now we have committees really looking into it.
*  McCarthy got to head off a painful vote for members and did not actually have to do an impeachment
*  vote on the House floor and a lot of times the way people kind of bury legislation they don't want
*  to deal with is just to refer to committees. So I heard from a lot of moderate Republicans who hope
*  that this was the last we ever hear of Bober's impeachment articles and they just die a quiet
*  death in the Homeland Security and Judiciary committees. We'll see. Right, there's always the chance
*  that those articles of impeachment come out of that committee and are referred to the full House.
*  I mean, any once again, if we think about McCarthy's playbook here, it feels like his best option
*  as with the shift censure was to water down an act of rebellion here once again rather than truly
*  snuffin out. Exactly right. He again, the kind of found a way to divert this to make it less painful
*  for his members to make it less painful for himself to make it less embarrassing for Republicans.
*  But still, what did we do this last week in the House? We covered, you know, then considering
*  impeachment articles brought by one of the far right members of the conference who are dictating
*  what the business on the floor is this week as they did when they shut it down completely.
*  So he's doing the best he can in each one of these cases. It's almost like playing whack-a-mull,
*  trying to put each one of these down in a way that causes him and the conference the least pain.
*  And this all feels like the precise scenario that so many political observers and our colleagues
*  at the time predicted might come to pass, given the math of this Congress, that the Republican
*  majority would be so small that it would empower a few of these firebrands like your Lauren Boberts,
*  whose actions would color how voters view the entire Republican party. And you mentioned that
*  McCarthy worries a loud that this is going to result in Republicans losing the House. I'm kind of
*  curious based on your reporting, if that's a widely held view, that this campaign of vengeance,
*  this mutiny against McCarthy, if it really is seen as something that is a perilous political path
*  for the Republicans. It is. I mean, I think there's a lot of concern among Republicans who work
*  on the Hill, who work around the Hill, that they could lose the House majority next year.
*  And this is exactly the kind of behavior and the kind of bills that will ensure that.
*  And this kind of behavior is exactly what makes them all so live it at members like Lauren Boberts.
*  If McCarthy is right and these far right House members are putting the entire party on a very
*  dangerous political path, what can McCarthy do about it? I mean, it sounds like there's not much
*  he can do, but are there any options? I assume he doesn't want to be the Republican speaker who
*  barely got elected in the first place and then oversees a two-year narrow Republican majority,
*  but that is what he is openly worrying is about to happen.
*  Yes, he's openly worrying about that possibility. And I think he doesn't think particularly long
*  term like that. I think he's on a day-to-day whack-a-mall lifestyle right now, where he has to deal with
*  the fire in front of him and his MO is like live another day, survive another day. I think that he
*  does still have a lot of confidence from a large majority of his members who think like this is
*  an impossible situation and it's not exactly clear who could be handling this any better. It's a
*  terrible job, a terrible dynamic and he doesn't have much control. So, Annie, what is going to be the next
*  chapter of this saga for the House Republicans? The next chapter of this saga becomes a lot more serious.
*  When Congress comes back from their recess that they start this week, they have some actual
*  serious business before them, like passing important spending bills, funding the government,
*  staving off a government shutdown. So, the stakes are going to matter. So, what's going to happen is
*  McCarthy is going to be dealing with this same dynamic where he's playing whack-a-mall every day
*  and he's going to be dealing with the same lack of trust and anger that all grew out of the debt
*  sailing delay forage from Biden. While, also have to pass really important bills, that's what awaits him
*  after recess. Sounds like a dream for him. Dream job.
*  Well, Annie, thank you very much. We appreciate it. Thank you, Michael.
*  Next week, when the House returns from recess, Republicans are expected to consider a set of
*  resolutions both introduced by far right members that would seek to expunge the two impeachments
*  of former President Trump on the grounds that the original cases against him were unconstitutional.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to nerdy.
*  On Monday, in his first public remark, since a rebellion against his government was called off,
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the revolt failed because, quote,
*  the entire Russian society united. The speech appeared to be aimed at projecting unity and
*  stability after the most serious challenge to Putin's power in decades. But in it, he offered a
*  major concession to members of the militia who staged the rebellion, saying that if they wished,
*  they could move to neighboring Belarus and rejoin their leader, Yvgeny Pregozion, who led the rebellion.
*  Ann.
*  On Monday night, CNN published an audio recording from 2021, in which former President Trump shared
*  classified information about a possible plan of attack against Iran, with writers who lacked
*  security clearances. The recording has become a centripes of the special counsel's indictment
*  against Trump for taking classified documents from the White House and refusing to return them.
*  In the recording, Trump acknowledges to those in the room that the material he's showing off
*  is highly sensitive and explicitly states that he had not declassified them.
*  Today's episode was produced by Mary Wilson, Will Wheat, Carlos Prieto, and Shannon Lim.
*  It was edited by Patricia Willens and Devon Taylor, contains original music by Alicia Baitu,
*  Diane Wong, and Roenemisto, and was engineered by Chris Wood. Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and
*  Ben Lantfurk of Wonderly.
*  That's it for the Daily. I'm Michael Baboro. See you tomorrow.
