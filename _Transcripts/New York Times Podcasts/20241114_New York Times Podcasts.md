# Clip Cabinet Appointments, Provocative Picks, and Trumpâ€™s Return to The White House
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0qm6CDIH3M)
*  Friends, welcome to the first post-election daily roundtable, which we are taping at around
*  2.45 p.m. on Wednesday.
*  We always disclose that in case something happens during or after our taping that's significant
*  that we don't cover here.
*  It turns out there is enough news post-campaign to merit a return to this glorious format.
*  In fact, there's so much news happening that we did this very last minute, which explains
*  why none of us are in the same room, which is the idea of a roundtable, and you're all
*  spread out across, I believe, the city of Washington, D.C., in different tiny rooms
*  with phones held up to your face.
*  Maggie, Julie, Peter, thank you for making time for us.
*  Thank you, Mike.
*  Thanks for having us.
*  Thanks for having us.
*  I think we have to start with the blizzard of appointments that President-elect Trump
*  has made over the past few days, seemingly an appointment every hour.
*  And just to begin with, the pace of it, correct me if I'm wrong, is unusually fast.
*  I went back and checked the clips.
*  Many of you wrote the stories from four years ago.
*  Biden was elected and it took him about a week or so to make his first appointment chief
*  of staff.
*  It feels like Trump has filled half his cabinet in that same week long period.
*  Is that right?
*  I don't know about half, but he's filled certainly a number of the top roles.
*  And it's not just faster than what Biden did.
*  It's faster than what Trump did the first go around.
*  Trump announced his chief of staff along with his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, on November
*  13th, which was five days after Election Day.
*  This was two days after Election Day that he announced his chief of staff.
*  He has announced picks for Secretary of Defense for DHS.
*  The list goes on and on.
*  But that's a huge number of major appointments filled very fast.
*  What's the rush, Peter?
*  Well, clearly he doesn't want to sit on his laurels here.
*  He's eager to get going.
*  He knows what he's doing this time in a way he didn't know eight years ago.
*  He's thought a lot about who around him he trusts.
*  Last time he had to be introduced to a lot of Republicans he didn't know and then think
*  about how they fit into a government which he had never served in.
*  So he has the advantage, in effect, of doing this from scratch in a way that frankly no
*  second term president's ever done.
*  Most second term presidents are already in the office.
*  They're not having a whole new government started from scratch, in effect, after an
*  election the way this one has.
*  But he has the advantage of having had four years of experience in that way.
*  All right.
*  Well, we can't cover all these appointments.
*  There are simply too many of them.
*  So we're going to focus on just a few that really begin to tell us about Trump's priorities
*  in the second presidency and his approach to governing.
*  So I want to begin with two people whose portfolio will be heavily focused on immigration, Stephen
*  Miller and Tom Homan.
*  Julie, you know a lot about Stephen Miller because you covered immigration heavily during
*  the first term presidency.
*  Right. And Stephen Miller was really sort of the architect of a lot of the immigration
*  policies and really the whole sort of language and vision for immigration that Trump brought
*  not only during the campaign, but in the very beginning of his first term of his presidency,
*  when, you know, Miller led a very sort of aggressive, all encompassing effort to try
*  to get a bunch of executive orders and a bunch of policy on the track before Trump came into
*  office.
*  We all remember the Muslim ban.
*  There were executive orders that had to do with sanctuary cities and cracking down in
*  various ways.
*  And then, of course, starting the initial stages of this build the wall plan that never
*  actually reached fruition.
*  But he really made it his his business to figure out ways to pull the levers that Trump
*  would need to pull in order to massively change the way immigration happens in this country.
*  And what we saw at the beginning of his first term was he ran into a lot of obstacles.
*  And it was very clear very quickly that some of this stuff just couldn't happen in the
*  way that Miller was trying to make it happen and that Trump wanted to see.
*  But he has all of that experience under his belt from the first term.
*  And I think we could expect that to be, you know, very much his portfolio.
*  Again, he's learned a lot of lessons about how government works and how you would go
*  about implementing those things.
*  Peter Miller's job in the first term was senior adviser to the president.
*  Now he's got a big promotion, right?
*  Deputy White House chief of staff.
*  So given what Julie just said, should we expect that everything she just said is going to
*  basically be on steroids?
*  Well, yeah, I mean, again, what they can do, first of all, is click back on a lot of the
*  things that Joe Biden clicked off.
*  Right. They they went through four years worth of crafting orders and crafting policies
*  that took them time to figure out, took them time to lawyer, took them time to to, you
*  know, understand how the bureaucracy worked.
*  And of course, Joe Biden comes in.
*  It didn't change all of them, but he did change a lot of them.
*  And they can they have the advantage now on January 20th of being much more ready to do
*  what they want to do. The Muslim ban that Julie just referenced was such a disaster
*  the first time around because they had no clue what they were doing.
*  Lawyers are talking to each other, but they weren't talking to the Justice Department,
*  which normally vets these kinds of things.
*  They suddenly did now. So they're going to do it at the Pentagon because he liked the
*  symbolism of it. But they were literally still crafting and editing this order as they
*  were driving in the motorcade over to the Pentagon at the last second.
*  You know, one of his aides actually is handwriting adjustments to the order he's going
*  to sign by pen on the order before he puts his his signature on it.
*  So it's not going to hopefully or from their point of view, hopefully, it's not going to
*  be as chaotic as that. They have a better sense of how to do it this time.
*  But we'll see, obviously, you know, chaos does tend to follow Trump wherever he goes.
*  But they have the advantage of that four years experience.
*  Now, let's talk about Tom Homan. And I think the best way to introduce our listeners to
*  him, he's going to be Trump's border czar, is to play a piece of tape from an
*  appearance he made last year at the Conservative Political Action Committee's annual
*  meeting just outside Washington, where he talked about his zero tolerance policy,
*  which he created with Stephen Miller in the first Trump presidency.
*  And in particular, he had just been asked about child separation, which was a
*  component of the zero tolerance policy.
*  This is what he said. I wake up every day pissed off because this administration
*  destroyed the most secure border in a lifetime.
*  And I'm sick and tired of hearing about the family separation.
*  And I'm still being sued over that. So come get me.
*  I don't give a right bottom line.
*  We enforce the law.
*  Maggie, what do we make of this kind of rhetoric that was during a campaign where
*  he wanted Trump to become president and he's critiquing Biden's policies?
*  That rhetoric is now the man who's overseeing the border and defending child
*  separation, which a federal judge struck down during Trump's presidency as illegal.
*  He's saying I have no problems with it.
*  Julie's point about Stephen Miller's role, I think, is the right one, Michael.
*  He is running all of this.
*  He will work very closely with Tom Homan.
*  Homan is is a hardliner.
*  He is very clear about this.
*  He was very pro family separation as a policy.
*  He pushed it for years before Donald Trump was in office.
*  And then once he was in office, saw it as a very effective deterrent.
*  Donald Trump moved off of that after negative press.
*  And frankly, negative press coverage may still be one of the few guardrails that
*  Donald Trump is responsive to.
*  I think that that could stay the same in this White House.
*  But Homan is moving very quickly.
*  He talked about this on Fox News earlier this week that they are going to go after
*  sanctuary cities to try to have an impact there, such as New York, which has faced a
*  big influx of migrants and which Mayor Eric Adams has been very vocal about and much
*  more on the side of Donald Trump than President Biden.
*  Surprisingly so for a Democrat.
*  Correct. But I think that you will see there are a number of Democrats who in major
*  cities in blue states who are concerned about this.
*  And so I think that you are going to see Homan, maybe he won't be quite so colorful
*  as he was in that speech, but I think that you are going to see him lean in to what he
*  plans to do, because the feeling in the incoming Trump administration is unlike 2016,
*  where he certainly campaigned on a ban on Muslims entering the country, that mass
*  deportations came pretty late as a concept in that campaign.
*  He talked about a border wall mostly.
*  Mass deportations were fall of 2016 on this campaign.
*  He has been talking about the largest mass deportation operation in U.S.
*  history for over a year.
*  And and he won with he won the popular vote and he won the Electoral College.
*  And so they believe that they are going in with a majority of people voting for this
*  vision that Trump has articulated.
*  And Homan is going to talk about that and try to implement it as aggressively as possible.
