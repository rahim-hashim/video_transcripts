# The Oct. 7 Warning That Israel Ignored
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-kWt1jhA7Y)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  In the weeks since Hamas carried out a devastating terror attack inside of Israel, my colleague
*  Ronan Bergman has been investigating what kind of warnings Israel missed beforehand.
*  Today, the story of one of those warnings.
*  It's Monday, December 4th.
*  Ronan, this is your first time on The Daily, and you bring a unique expertise that I'd
*  like you to describe for just a moment, because you have been covering the Israeli military
*  and its intelligence services for decades, and you've gotten to know those worlds extremely
*  well.
*  Israel is the country that I think is influenced by its intelligence service more than any
*  other country in the Western world.
*  It always had the biggest intelligence community per capita, and today it's the second biggest
*  intelligence community in total number after the U.S.
*  Wow.
*  So just think of the size difference of those countries.
*  So Israeli security strategy is based on the intelligence services to supply a pre-alert
*  to any kind of enemy intent to launch a preemptive strike on Israel, to supply with viable real-time
*  intelligence.
*  What are the intents and the capabilities of the enemy?
*  And it's vast.
*  It takes massive resources, and it has a lot of secrets.
*  Every day they create unbelievable stories.
*  Not all of them, by the way, are glorifying them.
*  Sometimes the Israeli James Bond looks more like Inspector Clouzot, but it's always interesting,
*  and it's always very consequential.
*  There's no historical turn.
*  There's no historical event.
*  There's no major decision-making process in the history of Israel that the intelligence
*  community didn't have a massive, important imprint, if not the decisive role in that.
*  So this is my professional task.
*  I'm trying, at least, to give the readers of the New York Times a better understanding
*  of how this secret realm is so consequential on everything we see in the real world.
*  Right.
*  And in your capacity as a journalist deeply wired into the Israeli military and that unprecedented
*  intelligence apparatus that you just described, you, of course, end up spending a lot of time
*  after October 7th trying to understand how Israel's government failed to anticipate
*  that attack or really even blunt it.
*  It's always been in my head this question that didn't leave, that didn't stop bothering
*  me.
*  How could this happen?
*  And what I was getting at the beginning when I was speaking with people, even at the first
*  evening, with sources, with officials, throughout the intelligence community and the defense
*  establishment, they all said, we had no idea.
*  They all said there was nothing, just a total 100% shock surprise from zero to 100 in a
*  second with no clue, no nothing that would suggest that this is coming.
*  Were you skeptical of that, Ronin?
*  I was a little bit skeptical in this, I would say, spontaneous and very fast admittal into
*  an intelligence officer would not like to admit, which means that the intelligence coverage,
*  human intelligence, signal intelligence, cyber and all the rest just failed completely.
*  Nothing.
*  The channels were empty.
*  So I thought either it's courageous, people with kahunas who say we failed.
*  Because I heard this from multiple, multiple directions, I thought that's a little bit
*  odd.
*  Maybe some people are courageous and maybe some people are very fast to admit something
*  that is very embarrassing, but in order to hide, to cover up on a much darker truth.
*  And so I started to speak with sources and then I think it was two days after the war
*  began when a source said, listen, 8200, that's the Israeli equivalent to the NSA or the British
*  GCHQ, the Cyber and Signal Intelligence Unit, which is the biggest single unit in the Israeli
*  defense establishment.
*  And also one who takes the best brains, the best youth when they are being drafted to
*  the military.
*  So they said 8200 long ago stopped or diminished its dealing with tactical communication of
*  Hamas.
*  But then after a few days, I get another source who says this is not even important because
*  the real story is not about what they didn't know, not about the lack of coverage, tactical
*  or strategic, whatever.
*  It's about what they knew.
*  There was the sources, there was something big in the pipeline.
*  And he suggests to say they knew something about how this is going to happen.
*  But the source was vague, the source was evasive, which of course makes me a little bit mad.
*  So he said, I know this is not what you want to get and maybe one day I'll tell you.
*  And I said, I told the source, listen, if there's a dark secret in 8200 in our days,
*  this will not remain a secret for a long time.
*  And then I start hearing something that's codenamed or named the email thread with the
*  southern command.
*  People start describing something to you as the email thread of the southern command.
*  Yes.
*  And I start hearing stories that there's a woman who alerted, who got it right.
*  And then I got access to the email thread.
*  And in summary, what does it tell you?
*  It tells me that there is a veteran professional analyst that is sitting in an intelligence
*  base in the south.
*  This base is in charge of the intelligence collection from Gaza.
*  It's a massive base.
*  This woman is studying the battle techniques of Hamas.
*  And so in July 6 of this year, she writes the first email in that thread where she is
*  describing a military drill that Hamas was running in the center of Gaza city with two
*  platoons and she starts and say they were making this military exercise and it was madness.
*  And she is describing the drill, the drill, the exercise, including taking down a helicopter.
*  They are imitating the possibility.
*  So they are taking down Israeli helicopter.
*  They are taking down Israeli fighter jet.
*  They cross the border into Israel.
*  They raid a kibbutz.
*  They put the flag on the synagogue of the kibbutz.
*  And then they raid some kind of a military academy.
*  They kill all the cadets.
*  Of course there are lots of people playing there.
*  From early dawn until the night, they were doing it with bigger forces, bigger capability.
*  And generally she says, I never saw anything like that.
*  It was madness.
*  Now madness is not usually a word that you use in those usually very dry intelligence
*  reports.
*  She said that was shigaon, terrible in Hebrew, madness or crazy.
*  It also had a sense of almost, I would say she was impressed from those military capabilities.
*  And at the end of this report, she adds, here is another small addition.
*  One of the commandos was speaking over the radio with another one and he was using a
*  quote from the Quran from Surat Al-Madea, which is the specific chapter.
*  The quote was, whoever passes this gate and surprising the other side will get the blessing
*  of Allah.
*  And she says, referring to the address of the email, you remember this quote?
*  This is the same quote that is at the very beginning of Jericho Wall.
*  I just want to pause for a minute.
*  So in the days after October 7th, you end up obtaining these highly sensitive internal
*  emails in which this analyst has picked up on an elaborate drill in which members of
*  Hamas very much seem to be planning some kind of attack and in communicating this
*  drill to the people she works with.
*  This analyst invokes a quote from one of the commandos, uses this phrase Jericho Wall.
*  It seems like that phrase might mean something.
*  What do you end up coming to understand it means?
*  She uses that twice.
*  And it's clear that it's not physically the walls of Jericho, which is an ancient and
*  modern city.
*  In the Bible, the Israelites came and surrounded Jericho and toppled its walls and conquered
*  the city.
*  So it's clearly a code name.
*  And she referenced to that code name and says, what we see in that drill is a complete overlap
*  with Jericho Wall.
*  So suddenly you want to know what on earth is Jericho Wall?
*  Yes.
*  And so I start asking around when you say Jericho Wall, say, ah, the booklet.
*  I hear this a lot.
*  Oh, the booklet.
*  You mean the booklet.
*  And in a certain point in a certain military facility, I was able to get and read the booklet,
*  Jericho Wall.
*  And what is it?
*  It's a shocking document.
*  It's the last updated Hamas plan to attack Israel.
*  It was obtained by Israeli intelligence after massive effort during 2022, more than a year
*  ago.
*  And it's about 40 pages.
*  I saw the translation to Hebrew.
*  This was the one that was shared with many seniors and analysts inside Israeli intelligence.
*  And I said, it's shocking because the first thing you realize is the depth of intelligence
*  that Hamas was able to gather on Israel.
*  Like what?
*  The purpose of Jericho Wall is to take down the Gaza Division.
*  The Gaza Division is the division that is protecting the Israeli Gaza border.
*  They control a massive fence which is erected above ground and underground to stop the tunnels,
*  but it's also fortified with many cameras and communication hubs.
*  And I see all the details, the secret details of how this works, how many people, where
*  they sit, where is the headquarters, where the regional brigades?
*  Where are the towers with the machine guns?
*  Where are the scouts watching them and operating them?
*  You see everything into how the front is built and protected.
*  In the hands of Hamas, in this booklet that Hamas has written in a plan for attacking
*  Israel.
*  But they take the intelligence and they translate that into a detailed attack plan that describes
*  how to attack the border.
*  First to have a massive bombardment with mortars, rockets and missiles on Israel to create diversion.
*  They have a detailed plan how to neutralize the cameras, the communication hub using drones,
*  using paraglides.
*  And then they have raiding forces that are tasked to break the fence in 60 different
*  places.
*  And of course everything you are describing from this plan is precisely what happens on
*  October 7th.
*  That plan becomes a reality.
*  Nobody could believe that this could happen, but it did.
*  To the details, this is the master plan for what happened on October 7th.
*  So I want to return to that analyst you mentioned earlier, because she clearly does take this
*  report seriously.
*  She warns in an email that she thinks that a drill that she's watching happening in Gaza
*  is basically a dry run for the Jericho wall plan that she has read.
*  And so what happens when she flags this to the people around her?
*  So first everybody is complimenting her for the detailed job that she's doing, because
*  I'm just giving you the gist, but this is a long memo with very detailed meticulous work.
*  And then the intelligence chief of the Gaza division, he says, compliments, compliments,
*  intelligence gold, but we need to keep that in proportion.
*  We need to differentiate between what they do for show-off and what they're really able
*  to do.
*  Because the scenario, he says to the analyst, the scenario that you described at the beginning
*  of this email, conquering the kibbutz, putting the flag, this is imaginative.
*  So he challenges her reading into the current Hamas capabilities, and he says, no, they
*  can do this on dry when there is no enemy, so no Israelis when they're not actually firing.
*  But this is for show-off.
*  But she is not shy.
*  She is reacting.
*  She says, this is not imaginative.
*  This is not something that they are hoping to do.
*  This is something they want to do and capable of doing.
*  And then she says something which is, I think, maybe the most important.
*  She says, this is a plan for invasion, not a plan for a raid.
*  Because the whole terminology of everybody, even the unit that is in charge, was raid.
*  Raid, small scale, two platoons crossing the border.
*  She says this is a preparation for war and it can happen.
*  So the analyst's colleague, who's a very important figure in keeping Israel safe from Gaza, he
*  basically says to this analyst, I think you're wrong.
*  This isn't a drill for a real-life attack.
*  Hamas can't do what you think they can do.
*  Thank you for your work.
*  It's very impressive.
*  But your worries are misplaced.
*  And the analyst comes back and says, no, no, no, no, you are wrong.
*  They can do this.
*  This isn't for show.
*  You should be very worried about this.
*  But ultimately, his view carries the day.
*  His view carries the day because this was the common wisdom.
*  She was going against the stream.
*  She was saying something, together with two of colleagues from her base that supported
*  her in the exchange.
*  She was saying everything you, everybody else, believe about Jericho Wall is wrong.
*  Jericho Wall is for real.
*  And it's about what Hamas is capable of doing now.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Ronan, help us understand why no one took these warnings from this analyst seriously
*  and ultimately why nobody who read the Jericho Wall blueprint behaved in a way that might
*  have stopped this attack.
*  The intelligence blunder has three parts.
*  First of all, a total misreading of Hamas mindset, or maybe be more precise, what was
*  going in the head of Yich Yassin, the leader of Hamas in Gaza.
*  They know him for a long time, 22 years he spent in Israeli prison.
*  It's not a new guy.
*  They knew that there's a struggle in Hamas.
*  One part wants to be a ruler of a state that is theirs.
*  If you are governing a state, you need to take care of the water, of the electricity,
*  of the sewage, of the health.
*  You cannot afford yourself to be in all-out war with Israel because then you cannot supply
*  those services.
*  And the other side of Hamas was about a permanent status of war.
*  And Israel believed that Sinwar was ultimately starting to lean towards governance and away
*  from war.
*  Yes.
*  And Israel believed that this is going towards a good place.
*  Five days before the invasion, the national security adviser for Prime Minister Netanyahu,
*  gave an interview to military radio where he said, Hamas is totally deterred.
*  They learned the lesson from the previous round of hostilities this May 21.
*  They understand the price of defiance.
*  They don't want that.
*  And it's all going towards the direction of calm period.
*  So you're describing a misunderstanding or underestimating of Hamas' intent.
*  Of Sinwar intent?
*  Sinwar and his buddies, the people around him in Gaza, he took a decision.
*  This is about intents.
*  What else explains this failure to heed the warnings of this Jericho Wall report beyond
*  misunderstanding Sinwar's intent?
*  The national intelligence analyst will make a clear distinction between assessing intent
*  and assessing capabilities.
*  So if you fail one, the other will have sort of a safety button.
*  But here, I think they were influenced by the understanding that Sinwar is not going
*  towards war.
*  It is not planning an all out attack against Israel.
*  And so maybe subconsciously, they didn't understand how important is the military buildup.
*  Now some of this was just deception.
*  So for example, Hamas did not do a full exercise of all the fighting forces.
*  So there was no one incident, many, many military drills, but there was no single event that
*  Israel could see all the different platoons together standing.
*  And you're saying the capacity that Israel did see, they underestimated it because they
*  had allowed their views of that capacity to be so colored by their determination that
*  Sinwar, that Hamas, was not in this moment a threat.
*  So their views of intent bled over into their views of capacity.
*  Yes.
*  And also just maybe poor intelligence, poor assessment, poor professional understanding.
*  In November of 22, Israeli Southern Command is writing a memo.
*  They say Hamas have between 2,000 and 3,000 Nukhba commando gunmen trained and ready to
*  be deployed.
*  However, Hamas is capable of deploying only 70.
*  Okay, 70 is not that bad.
*  It dictates a total different set of preparation and defenses from Israel.
*  So on top of everything you're describing so far, Ronan, a misunderstanding of intent,
*  a misunderstanding of capacity, I'm curious how much Israel also just misunderstood its
*  own security system, right?
*  Israel spoke so frequently about this fence, which turned out wasn't impregnable.
*  The fence was created as a lesson from a round of hostilities in 2014 when Israel discovered
*  that Hamas is digging tunnels from Gaza into Israel.
*  Now those are very hard to detect, very hard to destroy, and Israel started to think of
*  how technology can solve that.
*  And six years later, they finished building this massive barrier that had also that like
*  above ground wall and underground up to 100 meters deep with sensors with explosives.
*  In practice, it solved the problem of the tunnels.
*  Hamas was not able to continue with this anymore at all, but it forced Hamas to be smarter.
*  It forced Hamas to work on an open field and plan how they will execute Jericho wall
*  above ground.
*  And nobody in Israel believed that this can be like open.
*  If it's open, then we don't need to detect them.
*  We have all those computers and telescopes and scouts and cameras.
*  Right.
*  We'll see it.
*  Yeah, we'll see it.
*  People of the military got completely enchanted by the wall.
*  And in time, they allocated fewer and fewer forces to the southern front.
*  And those forces were less and less alert because it's all about technology.
*  In short, you're saying Israel became complacent.
*  The forces on the border were not sharp, were not ready because they said that the
*  fence is invincible.
*  You see the videos from the day of the invasion.
*  You see how easy it was for Hamas to break the fence.
*  And you don't understand the gap between invincible and, you know, just one bulldozer.
*  Just take it out.
*  What would have happened in a world where the Jericho wall report was taken much more
*  seriously, had been distributed much more widely, and more and more people in the military
*  and in the government took the view of this analyst, for example?
*  How easily could Israel have prepared for and prevented the ultimate October 7th attack
*  if they had decided that report, that plan was for real?
*  So the other day, someone very high rank official in the southern front, he calls me and he
*  asked me to come to see him privately.
*  So I understand it's something very secret.
*  And when I come and see him, he says, do you know what is Jericho wall?
*  I said, well, as it happens, I know because you hadn't you hadn't yet published your investigation.
*  Yeah.
*  And he said, I didn't know until yesterday.
*  He didn't know.
*  And I said, OK, what would you do if you knew?
*  And he says, there are two options here.
*  Either you deem the force of Hamas at this moment is too risky to Israel, and then you
*  go to preemptive surprise attack against Hamas to take them down.
*  But also acknowledging, we both said this immediately and simultaneously, there was
*  no government, no prime minister, no public that would support such a ground invasion
*  before October 7th.
*  So the other option is to prepare in case that happens.
*  Some steps are easy, put landmines by defense.
*  And some are by far more significant.
*  So instead of four battalions, Israel would need to have throughout the year four to five
*  brigades.
*  This is massive.
*  We're talking about like twenty thousand troops.
*  But there's no other way.
*  Because if you think that there is a threat, if they have the capability, you don't need
*  even to think about the intent.
*  None of that happened.
*  They did not put landmines.
*  They did not enlarge the forces because they didn't think it's real.
*  So I have to ask, what has been the reaction to your reporting within Israel?
*  The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said there will be a moment to account for
*  his government's failings to prevent October 7th when the war is over.
*  Is what you have found here the existence of this report and the failure to take it
*  seriously?
*  Is that going to mean that when that accounting comes, it's going to be devastating, especially
*  for him?
*  Benjamin Netanyahu is occupied mainly with one thing, to put all the blame on the shoulders
*  of the intelligence and the military.
*  Now, not that they didn't fail.
*  They did.
*  Their leaders took responsibility.
*  They said, we failed.
*  We will conclude the necessary lessons after the war, which is in Hebrew.
*  That means that they will resign.
*  But first they said, we need to fight.
*  Benjamin Netanyahu said, it's not me.
*  It's them here.
*  They took responsibility.
*  And in any case, we don't investigate now.
*  Now, if there is a true investigation after the war, what we discuss now, this is going
*  to be one of the main chapters of the investigation panel.
*  Right.
*  How can it not be?
*  No doubt.
*  I was in a meeting where a senior New York Times editor asked a high-rank official if
*  there's a moment he regrets in hindsight, that he could do something else.
*  And that person said, we will all have a lifetime to think about that.
*  So we're talking about high-level officials, but I'm curious how much this attack and the
*  idea that it was preventable, how that has changed how everyday Israelis view this enormous
*  military intelligence apparatus that we have been talking about here that was supposed
*  to protect them.
*  I think most Israelis didn't need the New York Times to know that intelligence failed
*  because the failure is just all over the defense establishment.
*  The failure to prevent and then when it happens to rush the forces and save those people that
*  are being butchered was clear from the first evening.
*  He writes exactly into the reasons why Israel was established in the first place.
*  The promise that every Jew that comes to Israel will be protected was one of the main cores
*  of the establishment, the DNA of every Israeli.
*  That contract between the state and the Jewish people was brutally violated.
*  When I was a kid and basically throughout my life, everyone always complained about
*  the government that it's dysfunctional, that it's corrupt, but everybody were also living
*  under the assumption that whatever the government does, the defense establishment is a different
*  island, it's a different universe.
*  And they might fail from time to time, but at the end of the day, they will supply the
*  necessary security that would prevent any enemy to reach Israeli territory.
*  That feeling of confidence was hammered.
*  People in Tel Aviv now are afraid to leave their houses.
*  And so this intelligence blunder will haunt the Israeli future for many, many years.
*  Well, Ronan, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  Pleasure to be with you.
*  Over the weekend, Israel appeared to set the stage for a ground invasion of southern Gaza
*  by bombarding the region with airstrikes and ordering residents of several towns there
*  to leave their homes.
*  In remarks to reporters, a spokesman for the Israeli military sought to dispel the idea
*  that Israel's goal of destroying Hamas could be accomplished in a short period of time.
*  The spokesman described a, quote, long war that is not bound by time.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On this vote, the yeas are 311.
*  The nays are 114.
*  Two thirds voting in the affirmative.
*  The resolution is adopted.
*  The chair announces to the House that in light of the expulsion of the gentleman from New
*  York, Mr. Santos, the whole number of the House is now 434.
*  The expulsion of Republican Congressman George Santos of New York on Friday over serial fabrications
*  and allegations of theft from his own campaign has touched off an intense battle to replace
*  him.
*  The Times reports that the governor of New York is expected to schedule a special election
*  to fill Santos's seat in February, an election likely to become one of the most high-profile,
*  competitive and expensive off-year races in decades.
*  Santos's former district on Long Island is politically moderate and both Republicans
*  and Democrats see it as a major electoral prize in a closely divided House.
