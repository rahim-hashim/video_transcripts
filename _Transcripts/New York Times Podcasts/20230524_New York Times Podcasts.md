*  Okay, now here's today's show.
*  From The New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tevernici.
*  And this is The Daily.
*  After almost a year of fighting, Russia finally captured Bachmuth, a city in eastern Ukraine,
*  with Moscow declaring it a mission accomplished moment.
*  Today, my colleague Eric Schmidt explains what the capture really means and why the next
*  few months for Ukraine are so critical.
*  It's Wednesday, May 24.
*  So, Eric, you and I and all of our colleagues have been watching this one city in eastern
*  Ukraine, Bachmuth.
*  It's literally been the focal point of the war over the past many months.
*  And finally, over the weekend, it fell.
*  Bachmuth fell to the Russians.
*  How important is this?
*  Well, you have to remember what kind of came before this.
*  Obviously, the Russians failed in their initial attempt.
*  They were driven out of Kiev.
*  They then resumed last summer in the fighting in the Donbass.
*  Then they suffered some other defeats in places called Kharkiv and Herzoghn in the southern
*  part of Ukraine.
*  So by late last summer, the Russians were looking for a victory.
*  Tonight, new details from the front lines of Ukraine.
*  The Russian-appointed leader in Ukraine's Donetsk region now claims that Russian forces
*  are closing in around the city of Bachmuth.
*  And they identified this city of about 75,000 people Bachmuth as a place where if they
*  could take that, they felt they could expand their presence in the Donbass.
*  The city became a key target for Russian forces after they were forced to withdraw from
*  other areas of the east.
*  And so they began focusing their attack on this city.
*  There is little strategic value.
*  It's not a military hub.
*  It's not a communications hub or a transport hub.
*  That said, Russia has had very few victories for quite a long time in this conflict.
*  And so any seizure or capture of part or most of Bachmuth would be seen as a success
*  as a victory by the country.
*  And for the most part, I think people thought, well, that's going to be probably given
*  the Russian wherewithal.
*  They would probably be able to take that city fairly easily.
*  Russian and Ukrainian forces are still fighting in the streets of Bachmuth, which Russia has
*  been trying to capture for several months, thousands of Russian troops have died trying
*  to take the eastern city.
*  But what happened was, Ukrainians decided, hey, we're going to make more of an investment
*  in this.
*  If this is so important to Russia, that they win, at least have a symbolic victory, if
*  not an actual military victory, we're going to stand in their way.
*  And we're going to hang on as long as we can to block the Russians from achieving that
*  triumph.
*  OK, so this is kind of a strategically unimportant place that for some reason became important.
*  That's right.
*  Think of it almost as if two dogs fighting over a bone here.
*  One is much larger and should have yanked this bone away long time ago.
*  But this smaller dog is hanging on for dear life and denying the bigger dog the bone.
*  That's kind of what's happening here.
*  And that because Bachmuth is so important for the Russians, the Ukrainians are hanging
*  on.
*  And by March, the American officials are kind of saying to the Ukrainians, hey, aren't you
*  worried here that you could be wasting too much manpower and resources that you're going
*  to need for future fights that are much more important to this larger campaign than this
*  place Bachmuth?
*  But the Ukrainians say no, we're going to hang on here because anything that can deny Putin
*  of victory isn't of itself a political victory for us, the underdog.
*  This is it's been for months and months now as we've pushed back on the Russians before.
*  Right and then over the weekend, of course, as we know, Bachmuth falls.
*  The Russians take it.
*  That's right.
*  The Russians declared basically mission accomplished.
*  The city is essentially a wasteland, although the Ukrainians are still fighting from outside
*  the city, so it's not completely over yet.
*  But what's really important here is what happens in the kind of critical next phase of the
*  war, the battle over Bachmuth might actually turn out to be a very smart strategy by the
*  Ukrainians.
*  A smart strategy.
*  But why would it be a smart strategy?
*  I mean, this is essentially the Ukrainians losing territory, right?
*  It's a loss for the Ukrainians.
*  That's right.
*  But go back and remember why the Ukrainians have been fighting over this for the last several
*  months anyway.
*  Their ideas have been pinned down as many Russian forces in this otherwise not as very
*  important place for as long as possible.
*  Bill and injure as many Russian forces as you can.
*  In fact, the United States says as many as 100,000 Russians have either died or been injured
*  since January, mostly in and around Bachmuth.
*  Wow.
*  That's more than the population of Bachmuth.
*  I mean, that is just an unbelievable number.
*  That's right.
*  And perhaps most important, it's buying time for the Ukrainians to build up this major
*  force, this big arsenal of weapons and newly trained soldiers that will mount a counter
*  offensive.
*  They're first really big push since last fall to take back territory that the Russians
*  hold.
*  It's a counter offensive that we believe is probably going to start as early as June.
*  Right.
*  The counter offensive, also known as the spring offensive, something that people have been
*  following this war closely, like you and I have, have been expecting for months.
*  Right.
*  And spring, because the mud sees is more or less over and the ground is hard enough
*  for large military vehicles to drive on.
*  So people watching the war have pegged this time as the chance for a major counter offensive
*  by Ukraine.
*  And tell us, Eric, when did the planning for it begin?
*  The planning began almost within weeks after the last major offensive that the Ukrainians
*  carried out last fall in Arizona.
*  They start planning how are they going to amass a big enough force to drive out the
*  Russians from the remaining territory that they still hold.
*  And so Zelensky starts going around and accressing the Western allies for munitions.
*  It's a great honor for me to be at the U.S. Congress and speak to you and all Americans.
*  Remember back in December, he visits the United States, leading the Ukraine for the first
*  time during the war to drum up support for things like the Patriot missile batteries.
*  For the Abrams tanks, both systems that the United States was initially reluctant to provide.
*  We have artillery.
*  Yes.
*  Thank you.
*  We have it.
*  Is it enough?
*  Honestly, not really.
*  And then most recently, just in the last week or so, he went on a global tour.
*  Ukrainian President Zelensky's diplomatic tour across Europe.
*  All this coming as Ukraine's long anticipated spring counteroffensive could be starting.
*  He went to Germany and got nearly $3 billion.
*  It's the biggest package of military aid that Germany's often Ukraine since this conflict
*  started.
*  It includes 30 leopard tanks, 15 anti-aircraft tanks, more than two.
*  He went to Britain.
*  Rishi Sunak's office saying new equipment for Ukraine would include hundreds of long-range
*  attack drones.
*  Last week, Britain's sinking.
*  And finally, he ended up at the G7 summit in Japan.
*  Washington confirmed that it has given the green light to training on much longed-for combat
*  jets.
*  Where he, for the first time, was able to get commitments from the United States to allow
*  Ukrainian pilots to train in American-made F-16 fighter jets.
*  And for the United States to allow European countries that own F-16s to transfer those important
*  fighter jets to Ukraine.
*  And it's followed a similar pattern to what we've seen with other requests for advanced
*  weapons.
*  The first the Allies say no, and then they say maybe, and then they finally get to yes.
*  It's a major victory for President Zelensky, both in acquiring some of the last important
*  weapons that he needs for this major offensive that's going to start very soon, but also
*  obtaining commitments for arms and ammunition.
*  This gives his commanders assurances that when this counter-offensive starts, they can
*  be as aggressive as possible because they know more is in the pipeline in the months to
*  come and that there is a commitment on the part of Western Allies to support him with
*  these major new weapon systems.
*  Okay, so now Zelensky has all this stuff, right, all these weapons.
*  And it's really at this point running what amounts to a modern Western-style fighting
*  force, a modern army.
*  And Russia is now up against that modern army really for the first time.
*  I mean, it hasn't seen this before in this war.
*  That's right.
*  There'll be tens of thousands of Ukrainian forces that have been trained, special tactics
*  by the United States and other Western Allies with much more modern equipment.
*  The Ukrainians got essentially a crash course in all this, and so how this actually plays
*  out on the ground is still to be seen.
*  This is the moment.
*  This is the moment that's been building for months, and now we'll see whether the Ukrainians
*  can perform, whether they can punch through these Russian defenses and take back territory.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Eric, when is this counteroffensive actually supposed to start?
*  So some military analysts believe that the early parts of the counteroffensive have already
*  started.
*  We're seeing signs that the Ukrainians are striking supply lines, for instance, railroad
*  tracks that would carry troops and supplies to the front lines.
*  We've seen attacks on ammunition depots and command posts by the Ukrainians in occupied
*  Crimea, which would disrupt the Russian ability to thwart the counteroffensive.
*  The Ukrainians are planning.
*  Then there was this mysterious drone strike over the Kremlin recently.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  There were a couple of small drones, you know, exploded.
*  They didn't hurt anybody.
*  They didn't kill anybody.
*  It was middle of the night.
*  Putin was not there in the Kremlin, but it raised all sorts of questions about who might
*  be responsible for that.
*  And then just recently, you've seen some kind of cross-border attacks carried out apparently
*  by Russians working for the Ukrainians inside of Russia itself.
*  Crazy.
*  Like, these are Russians helping Ukrainians?
*  Apparently so.
*  We don't know a lot of details about it, but it's a group called the Free Russian Legion,
*  who apparently are carrying out these kind of small-scale attacks, which is, again,
*  meant to show, hey, we can reach inside your country and strike you, not just hit your
*  military supply lines and, you know, affect the actual battle, but trying to strike a psychological
*  blow, sabotage type things, covert operations that are very disruptive and disorienting perhaps
*  for the Russians.
*  And this is all a preview of what's to come.
*  This pattern of attacks.
*  Yeah.
*  At least it's the pattern of the beginning.
*  Again, what you're trying to do in this instance of the Ukrainians, you're trying to confuse
*  the Russians as to what your objective is.
*  Where is this attack going to come?
*  How is it going to play out?
*  So we're going to see faints.
*  We're going to see misdirection, or you might see operations starting and stopping.
*  The Ukrainians are probing for vulnerabilities in these front lines in the south where
*  they're expected to strike hard and look for the areas where they might be able to make
*  a breakthrough.
*  And, Erika, once it actually begins this counteroffensive, what can we expect it to look like on
*  the ground?
*  I mean, they have all of these new weapons, right?
*  That's right.
*  If it works well for the Ukrainians, it should look a lot different than what we've seen
*  in the previous phases of this long war so far.
*  If you think about much of this war has been defined by exchanges, almost like a World
*  War I trench warfare artillery blasts back and forth, grinding out these very incremental
*  advances on either side.
*  This, again, if it works the way the Ukrainians and their western partners have designed
*  it, is going to move much faster.
*  You're going to have tanks on the ground.
*  You're going to have armored personnel carriers carrying troops moving through the battlefield
*  supported by artillery fire and synchronizing all of these different kinds of weapons and
*  tactics in a way that they haven't done before.
*  And if you can push ahead, you can gain ground much more quickly and break the will of the
*  Russians.
*  So, if it works as intended, this would be a much faster, more modern fight in which
*  Ukraine physically moves through the territory and takes it as it goes.
*  That's right.
*  That's the goal.
*  It's difficult to do, even for a military as advanced as say the American military,
*  particularly when they face the defenses that the Russians have thrown up in front of
*  them.
*  It's a big ask on the part of the Ukrainians, but that's what they've been training to
*  do for the last several months and we'll see if it works or not.
*  So, Eric, now we come to the eternal and probably unanswerable question, which is, how
*  long can we expect this offensive to last?
*  Well, there's a lot of things we don't know.
*  How well the Russians will defend the ground that they've been digging into for months
*  and months.
*  They've been laying trenches.
*  They've been putting down minefields.
*  They've been putting in things called tank traps.
*  So think of this as a months long campaign that's going to go at least through the summer.
*  And what would success look like for Ukraine coming out of this?
*  So, just in basic terms, remember, the Russians now control, still control about 18% of Ukrainian
*  territory.
*  Ukrainian's, one of their main goals, just sees back as much of that territory as they
*  can.
*  And that's important for at least two reasons.
*  One is they have to show all these Western donors that have given them all this equipment
*  and money and aid that they can win.
*  They can succeed.
*  There was a good investment in the end.
*  There was a good investment, right?
*  He backing us and continuing the future.
*  And the second other major reason is that they want to put themselves in the best possible
*  position for any kind of negotiated settlement, you know, win if that happens.
*  That's not really on the cards right now, but certainly people are thinking about that
*  and thinking about the impact that a counteroffensive could have on the outcome of such talks.
*  They'd have a much stronger hand sitting at that negotiating table with, say, the Russians
*  only at 5% of their country than they would with the Russians at 18% of their country.
*  That's right.
*  But the opposite could be true, too.
*  They say they don't do very well on this counteroffensive.
*  And despite all the weapons that they've been given, and despite the fact the Russians
*  have been hobbled by all sorts of problems with their logistics and leadership divisions,
*  you know, if the Ukrainians can't take advantage of all that and don't make substantial gains,
*  there's going to be a lot of pressure on them from the very people who've been supporting
*  them to say, hey, maybe this is the time to basically stop.
*  And negotiate a ceasefire.
*  We'll work out terms, but that would leave Russian control.
*  There's still a lot of Ukrainian territory, which is going to be hard for Zelensky to stomach.
*  So it sounds like the window for the Ukrainians to prove that this aid is working and they
*  can do it is finite, right?
*  Is closing.
*  That's right.
*  All these things that are basically riding on the successful outcome of this counteroffensive
*  are all coming into play in the next several weeks and months.
*  And so it really is almost a do or die moment for the Ukrainians in their media objectives.
*  It doesn't mean the war is going to end after this counteroffensive is over, but this is
*  an incredibly important phase of the war up to now.
*  And why is it so important now, Eric?
*  Like what is it about this moment?
*  First of all, the funding from the United States, both economic aid and military aid, is set
*  to expire and run out by the end of this summer.
*  And basically, what the counteroffensive will offer a taste of whatever his success or
*  not is made and will help the administration presumably make a case for more money.
*  Perhaps even more important is by this year or early next year for sure, the election
*  season will be upon us here in the United States.
*  And if Biden were to lose the White House, that could very likely mean the end of support
*  for Ukraine, depending on who wins, or at least cutbacks in that support.
*  The Russians know this, and it's been part of Putin's strategy.
*  He's already started to talk about, I can wait longer than you, the United States, the
*  West can.
*  Your resolve for Ukraine is going to wane.
*  And if there's a change of administrations in Washington, I will benefit.
*  That's Putin's thinking right now.
*  Right.
*  And of course, we've seen it time and time again in this war, right?
*  Including in Bakmut.
*  We are willing to go the distance, and we know you, Western countries, are going to lose
*  interest, turn away, and in the end, that means I win.
*  That's right.
*  And that's why a success and a rather resounding success is so important.
*  Because without that, you not only fill in your military objectives, but also your political
*  objectives become much cloudy or I think going forward.
*  So Eric stepping back here for a second, you know, thinking about Zelensky, the really
*  high stakes he's facing right now, and this critical phase of the war that's about to
*  begin.
*  How should I understand this moment?
*  And thinking back, you know, to the beginning of our conversation, how does Bakmut, this
*  little city in eastern Ukraine fit into it, if at all?
*  So in war, certain places emerge with outsized significance, even though they may be small
*  cities, like Bakmut, that don't seem to have, apparently a lot of strategic significance
*  at all.
*  Bakmut used to be this little town that nobody had ever heard of, and now it's literally
*  on the lips of not just an American president, but Russian president as well.
*  So depending on how this counter-offensive goes, there's a potential that Bakmut could
*  be seen as an important turning point in the war.
*  And here's what I mean.
*  If the counter-offensive does not go well, and there are going to be a lot of analysts
*  who say Ukraine made a grave mistake in focusing on its efforts, you know, pouring so much
*  manpower and equipment into this lost cause.
*  But if the offensive goes well for the Ukrainians, Bakmut could turn out to be a possible potential
*  turning point for how this underdog country could stand up to the giant Russian military.
*  Right, so in the best case scenario, Bakmut could be the marker in our memory of the
*  moment when Ukraine lost the battle but won the war.
*  It could be a small place with great importance if the counter-offensive goes well for Ukraine.
*  Eric, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  The Times reports that Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida will announce his highly anticipated
*  entry into the Republican presidential race tonight during a live conversation on Twitter
*  with the platform's owner, Elon Musk.
*  DeSantis will become the seventh Republican to announce his candidacy, a list that now
*  includes former President Donald Trump, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, and Senator Tim Scott
*  of South Carolina.
*  Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Trump's trial on 34 felony counts in connection with a hush money
*  scheme was scheduled for March of 2024 at the height of the Republican presidential primary.
*  During a hearing at which the trial date was announced, Trump became visibly angry over
*  the timing, waving his hands, and shaking his head.
