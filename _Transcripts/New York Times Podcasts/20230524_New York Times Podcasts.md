# Ukraine Lost in Bakhmut. But It Has Much Bigger Plans.
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8enhoBX7jIc)
*  Before we get started today, I wanted to share two pieces of exciting news.
*  The first is that we here at New York Times Audio have just released an app.
*  For fans of New York Times podcasts like you, it does something very helpful.
*  It takes all kinds of shows, like Serial, The Run-Up, This American Life, The Daily,
*  and gathers them into one place.
*  And it helps you discover the new shows that we're making that you might not know about.
*  And that brings me to the second piece of exciting news, which is that New York Times
*  Audio is launching a new news show.
*  It's called The Headlines.
*  As a daily listener, you know that what we do every day is we bring you one story in
*  depth.
*  But of course, our newsroom is covering dozens and dozens of stories every single day.
*  And that's what The Headlines is for.
*  It's a short show that brings you the top stories of the day, straight from the reporters
*  covering them.
*  This week, we're sending the show right down our feed for you to listen to.
*  And after that, you can find it on our app.
*  Search NYT Audio in the App Store or go to nytimes.com slash audio app.
*  Everything in there is available to all New York Times subscribers.
*  We hope you'll check it out.
*  Okay, now here's today's show.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi.
*  And this is The Daily.
*  After almost a year of fighting, Russia finally captured Bakhmut, a city in eastern Ukraine,
*  with Moscow declaring it a mission accomplished moment.
*  Today, my colleague Eric Schmidt explains what the capture really means and why the
*  next few months for Ukraine are so critical.
*  It's Wednesday, May 24th.
*  So, Eric, you and I and all of our colleagues have been watching this one city in eastern
*  Ukraine, Bakhmut.
*  It's literally been the focal point of the war over the past many months.
*  And finally, over the weekend, it fell.
*  Bakhmut fell to the Russians.
*  How important is this?
*  Well, you have to remember what kind of came before this.
*  Obviously, the Russians failed in their initial attempt.
*  They were driven out of Kiev.
*  They then resumed last summer in the fighting in the Donbas.
*  Then they suffered some other defeats in places called Kharkiv and Kherson in the southern
*  part of Ukraine.
*  So by late last summer, the Russians were looking for a victory.
*  Tonight, new details from the front lines of Ukraine.
*  The Russian appointed leader in Ukraine's Donetsk region now claims that Russian forces
*  are closing in around the city of Bakhmut.
*  And they identified this city of about 75,000 people, Bakhmut, as a place where if they
*  could take that, they felt they could expand their presence in the Donbas.
*  The city became a key target for Russian forces after they were forced to withdraw from other
*  areas of the east.
*  And so they began focusing their attack on this city.
*  There is little strategic value.
*  It's not a military hub.
*  It's not a communications hub or a transport hub.
*  That said, Russia has had very few victories for quite a long time in this conflict.
*  And so any seizure or capture of part or most of Bakhmut would be seen as a success, as
*  a victory by the...
*  And for the most part, I think people thought, well, that's going to be probably given the
*  Russian wherewithal.
*  They would probably be able to take that city fairly easily.
*  Russian and Ukrainian forces are still fighting in the streets of Bakhmut, which Russia has
*  been trying to capture for several months.
*  Thousands of Russian troops have died trying to take the eastern city.
*  But what happened was the Ukrainians decided, hey, you know, we're going to make more of
*  an investment in this.
*  If this is so important to Russia that they win, at least have a symbolic victory, if
*  not an actual military victory, we're going to stand in their way and we're going to hang
*  on as long as we can to block the Russians from achieving that triumph.
*  So this is kind of a strategically unimportant place that for some reason became important.
*  That's right.
*  Think of it almost as if two dogs fighting over a bone here.
*  One is much larger and should have yanked this bone away long time ago, but the smaller
*  dog is hanging on for dear life and denying the bigger dog the bone.
*  That's kind of what's happening here.
*  And that because Bakhmut is so important for the Russians, the Ukrainians are hanging on.
*  And by March, American officials are kind of saying to the Ukrainians, you know, hey,
*  aren't you worried here that you could be wasting too much manpower and resources that
*  you're going to need for future fights that are much more important to this larger campaign
*  than this place Bakhmut?
*  But the Ukrainians say no, we're going to hang on here because anything that can deny
*  Putin a victory is in of itself a political victory for us, the underdog.
*  Just as it's been for months and months now as we've pushed back on the Russians before.
*  Right.
*  And then over the weekend, of course, as we know, Bakhmut falls.
*  The Russians take it.
*  That's right.
*  The Russians declared basically mission accomplished.
*  The city is essentially a wasteland, although the Ukrainians are still fighting from outside
*  the city.
*  So it's not completely over yet.
*  But what's really important here is what happens in the kind of critical next phase of the
*  war, the battle over Bakhmut might actually turn out to be a very smart strategy by the
*  Ukrainians.
*  A smart strategy.
*  But why would it be a smart strategy?
*  I mean, this is essentially the Ukrainians losing territory, right?
*  It's a loss for the Ukrainians.
*  That's right.
*  But go back and remember why the Ukrainians have been fighting over this for the last
*  several months anyway.
*  Their idea has been pin down as many Russian forces in this otherwise not as very important
*  place for as long as possible.
*  And injure as many Russian forces as you can.
*  In fact, the United States says as many as 100,000 Russians have either died or been
*  injured since January, mostly in and around Bakhmut.
*  Wow.
*  That's more than the population of Bakhmut.
*  I mean, that is just an unbelievable number.
*  That's right.
*  And perhaps most important, it's buying time for the Ukrainians to build up this major
*  This big arsenal of weapons and newly trained soldiers that will mount a counteroffensive,
*  their first really big push since last fall to take back territory that the Russians hold.
*  It's a counteroffensive that we believe is probably going to start as early as June.
*  Right.
*  The counteroffensive, also known as the spring offensive, something that people who've been
*  following this war closely, like you and I have, have been expecting for months.
*  Right.
*  And spring because the mud season is more or less over and the ground is hard enough
*  for large military vehicles to drive on.
*  So people watching the war have pegged this time as the chance for a major counteroffensive
*  by Ukraine.
*  And tell us, Eric, when did the planning for it begin?
*  The planning began almost within weeks after the last major offensive that the Ukrainians
*  carried out last fall in Harrison.
*  They started planning.
*  How are they going to amass a big enough force to drive out the Russians from the remaining
*  territory that they still hold?
*  And so Zelensky starts going around and pressing the Western allies for munitions.
*  It's a great honor for me to be at the U.S. Congress and speak to you and all Americans.
*  You remember back in December, he visits the United States, leaving Ukraine for the first
*  time during the war to drum up support for things like the Patriot missile batteries.
*  For the Abrams tanks, both systems that the United States was initially reluctant to provide.
*  We have artillery.
*  Yes.
*  Thank you.
*  We have it.
*  Is it enough?
*  Honestly, not really.
*  And then most recently, just in the last week or so, he went on a global tour.
*  Ukrainian President Zelensky's diplomatic tour across Europe.
*  All this coming as Ukraine's long anticipated spring counteroffensive could be starting.
*  He went to Germany and got nearly three billion dollars.
*  It's the biggest package of military aid that Germany's offered Ukraine since this conflict
*  started and it includes 30 Leopard tanks, 15 anti-aircraft tanks, more than two.
*  He went to Britain.
*  Rysh Sunak's office saying new equipment for Ukraine would include hundreds of long-range
*  attack drones.
*  Last week, Britain said...
*  And finally, he ended up at the G7 summit in Japan.
*  Washington confirmed that it has given the green light to training on much longed for
*  combat jets.
*  Where he, for the first time, was able to get commitments from the United States to
*  allow Ukrainian pilots to train in American-made F-16 fighter jets and for the United States
*  to allow European countries that own F-16s to transfer those important fighter jets to
*  Ukraine.
*  It's a similar pattern to what we've seen with other requests for advanced weapons.
*  The first the allies say no and then they say maybe and then they finally get to yes.
*  It's a major victory for President Zelensky both in acquiring some of the last important
*  weapons that he needs for this major offensive that's going to start very soon, but also
*  obtaining commitments for arms and ammunition.
*  This gives his commanders assurances that when this counteroffensive starts, they can
*  be as aggressive as possible because they know more is in the pipeline in the months
*  to come and that there is a commitment on the part of Western allies to support him
*  with these major new weapons systems.
*  Okay, so now Zelensky has all this stuff, right?
*  All these weapons and is really at this point running what amounts to a modern Western-style
*  fighting force, a modern army.
*  And Russia is now up against that modern army really for the first time.
*  I mean, it hasn't seen this before in this war.
*  That's right.
*  There'll be tens of thousands of Ukrainian forces that have been trained, special tactics
*  by the United States and other Western allies with much more modern equipment.
*  But the Ukrainians got essentially a crash course in all this.
*  And so how this actually plays out on the ground is still to be seen.
*  This is the moment.
*  This is the moment that's been building for months.
*  And now we'll see whether the Ukrainians can perform, whether they can punch through
*  these Russian defenses and take back territory.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Eric, when is this counteroffensive actually supposed to start?
*  So some military analysts believe that the early parts of the counteroffensive have already started.
*  We're seeing signs that the Ukrainians are striking supply lines, for instance, railroad
*  tracks that would carry troops and supplies to the front lines.
*  We've seen attacks on ammunition depots and command posts by the Ukrainians in occupied
*  Crimea, which would disrupt the Russian ability to thwart the counteroffensive the Ukrainians
*  are planning.
*  Then there was this mysterious drone strike over the Kremlin recently.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Where a couple of small drones exploded.
*  They didn't hurt anybody.
*  They didn't kill anybody.
*  It was the middle of the night.
*  Putin was not there in the Kremlin.
*  But it raised all sorts of questions about who might be responsible for that.
*  And then just recently, you've seen some kind of cross-border attacks carried out apparently
*  by Russians working for the Ukrainians inside of Russia itself.
*  Crazy.
*  Like, these are Russians helping Ukrainians?
*  Apparently so.
*  We don't know a lot of details about it.
*  But it's a group called the Free Russian Legion, who apparently are carrying out these kind
*  of small scale attacks, which is again meant to show, hey, we can reach inside your country
*  and strike you, not just hit your military supply lines and affect the actual battle,
*  but trying to strike a psychological blow, sabotage type things, covert operations that
*  are very disruptive and disorienting perhaps for the Russians.
*  And this is all a preview of what's to come, this pattern of attacks.
*  Yeah.
*  At least it's a pattern of the beginning.
*  Again, what you're trying to do in this instance, if you're Ukrainians, you're trying to confuse
*  the Russians as to what your objective is.
*  Where is this attack going to come?
*  How is it going to play out?
*  So we're going to see feints.
*  We're going to see misdirection, or you might see operations starting and stopping.
*  The Ukrainians are probing for vulnerabilities in these front lines in the south where they're
*  expected to strike hard and look for the areas where they might be able to make a breakthrough.
*  And Eric, once it actually begins, this counteroffensive, what can we expect it to look like on the
*  ground?
*  I mean, they have all of these new weapons, right?
*  That's right.
*  If it works well for the Ukrainians, it should look a lot different than what we've seen
*  in the previous phases of this long war so far.
*  If you think about much of this war has been defined by exchanges, almost like a World
*  War I trench warfare, artillery blasts back and forth, grinding out these very incremental
*  advances on either side.
*  This, again, if it works the way the Ukrainians and their Western partners have designed it,
*  is going to move much faster.
*  You're going to have tanks on the ground.
*  You're going to have armored personnel carriers carrying troops moving through the battlefield
*  supported by artillery fire and synchronizing all of these different kinds of weapons and
*  tactics in a way that they haven't done before.
*  And if you can push ahead, you can gain ground much more quickly and break the will of the
*  Russians.
*  So if it works as intended, this would be a much faster, more modern fight in which
*  Ukraine physically moves through the territory and takes it as it goes.
*  That's right.
*  That's the goal.
*  And this is very difficult to do even for a military as advanced as, say, the American
*  military, particularly when they face the defenses that the Russians have thrown up
*  in front of them.
*  It's a big ask on the part of the Ukrainians, but that's what they've been training to
*  do for the last several months.
*  And we'll see if it works or not.
*  So Eric, now we come to the eternal and probably unanswerable question, which is, how long
*  can we expect this offensive to last?
*  Well there's a lot of things we don't know.
*  We don't know how well the Russians will defend the ground that they've been digging into
*  for months and months.
*  They've been laying trenches.
*  They've been putting down minefields.
*  They've been putting in things called tank traps.
*  So think of this as a months long campaign that's going to go at least through the summer.
*  And what would success look like for Ukraine coming out of this?
*  So just in basic terms, remember the Russians now still control about 18% of Ukrainian territory.
*  So the Ukrainians, one of their main goals is to just seize back as much of that territory
*  as they can.
*  And that's important for at least two reasons.
*  One is they have to show all these Western donors that have given them all this equipment
*  and money and aid that they can win.
*  They can succeed.
*  There was a good investment in the end.
*  There was a good investment, right.
*  They're going to keep backing us and continuing the future.
*  The second other major reason is that they want to put themselves in the best possible
*  position for any kind of negotiated settlement, you know, when and if that happens.
*  That's not really on the cards right now, but certainly people are thinking about that
*  and thinking about the impact that a counteroffensive could have on the outcome of such talks.
*  They'd have a much stronger hand sitting at that negotiating table with, say, the Russians
*  only at 5% of their country than they would with the Russians at 18% of their country.
*  That's right.
*  But the opposite could be true, too.
*  Let's say they don't do very well on this counteroffensive.
*  And despite all the weapons that they've been given, and despite the fact that Russians
*  have been hobbled by all sorts of problems with their logistics and leadership divisions,
*  you know, the Ukrainians can't take advantage of all that and don't make substantial gains.
*  There's going to be a lot of pressure on them from the very people who've been supporting
*  them to say, hey, maybe this is the time to basically stop, negotiate a ceasefire,
*  we'll work out terms, but that would leave Russia in control.
*  Still a lot of Ukrainian territory, which is going to be hard for Zelensky to stomach.
*  So it sounds like the window for the Ukrainians to prove that this aid is working and they
*  can do it is finite, right?
*  Is closing.
*  That's right.
*  The things that are basically riding on the successful outcome of this counteroffensive
*  are all coming into play in the next several weeks and months.
*  And so it really is almost a do or die moment for the Ukrainians in their immediate objectives.
*  It doesn't mean the war is going to end after this counteroffensive is over, but this is
*  an incredibly important phase of the war up till now.
*  And why is it so important now, Eric?
*  Like what is it about this moment?
*  the United States, both economic aid and military aid is set to expire, run out by the end of
*  this summer.
*  And basically what counteroffensive will offer a kind of taste of whatever success or not
*  is made and will help the administration presumably make a case for more money.
*  Perhaps even more important is by late this year, early next year, for sure, the election
*  season will be upon us here in the United States.
*  And if Biden were to lose the White House, that could very likely mean the end of support
*  for Ukraine, depending on who wins, or at least cutbacks in that support.
*  And the Russians know this.
*  And it's been part of Putin's strategy he's already started to talk about.
*  I can wait longer than you, the United States, the West can.
*  Your resolve for Ukraine is going to wane.
*  And if there's a change of administrations in Washington, I will benefit.
*  That's Putin's thinking right now.
*  Right.
*  And of course, we've seen it time and time again in this war, right, including in Bakhmut.
*  We are willing to go the distance.
*  And we know you Western countries are going to lose interest, turn away.
*  And in the end, that means I win.
*  That's right.
*  And that's why a success and a rather resounding success is so important.
*  Because without that, you not only fail on your military objectives, but also your political
*  objectives become much cloudier, I think, going forward.
*  So Eric, stepping back here for a second, you know, thinking about Zelensky, the really
*  high stakes he's facing right now in this critical phase of the war that's about to
*  begin.
*  How should I understand this moment?
*  And thinking back, you know, to the beginning of our conversation, how does Bakhmut, this
*  little city in eastern Ukraine, fit into it, if at all?
*  So in war, certain places emerge with outside significance, even though they may be small
*  cities like Bakhmut that don't seem to have apparently a lot of strategic significance
*  at all.
*  Bakhmut used to be this little town that nobody had ever heard of.
*  And now it's literally on the lips of not just American presidents, but Russian president
*  as well.
*  So depending on how this counteroffensive goes, there's a potential that Bakhmut could
*  be seen as an important turning point in the war.
*  And here's what I mean.
*  If the counteroffensive does not go well, and there are going to be a lot of analysts
*  who say Ukraine made a grave mistake in focusing on its efforts, you know, pouring so much
*  manpower and equipment into this lost cause.
*  But if the offensive goes well for the Ukrainians, Bakhmut could turn out to be a possible potential
*  turning point for how this underdog country could stand up to the giant Russian military.
*  Right.
*  So in the best case scenario, Bakhmut could be the marker in our memory of the moment
*  when Ukraine lost the battle but won the war.
*  It could be a small place with great importance if the counteroffensive goes well for Ukraine.
*  Eric, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  The Times reports that Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida will announce his highly anticipated
*  entry into the Republican presidential race tonight during a live conversation on Twitter
*  with the platform's owner, Elon Musk.
*  DeSantis will become the seventh Republican to announce his candidacy, a list that now
*  includes former President Donald Trump, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, and Senator Tim
*  Scott of South Carolina.
*  Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Trump's trial on 34 felony counts in connection with a hush
*  money scheme was scheduled for March of 2024 at the height of the Republican presidential
*  primary.
*  During a hearing at which the trial date was announced, Trump became visibly angry over
*  the timing, waving his hands and shaking his head.
*  Today's episode was produced by Alex Stern, Ricky Nowetzki, and Muzadeh.
