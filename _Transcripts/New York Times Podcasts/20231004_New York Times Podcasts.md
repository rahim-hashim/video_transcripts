# The Ouster of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRPLqXqpUso)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is a daily.
*  Today, for the first time in American history, the United States House of Representatives
*  has voted to remove its leader.
*  My colleague Luke Broadwater was there as it happened.
*  It's Wednesday, October 4th.
*  Luke, it's 5 p.m. on Tuesday night, and we come to you at a truly strange moment because
*  the United States House of Representatives has no speaker, right?
*  It is leaderless.
*  Yes.
*  For the first time in American history, the House of Representatives has voted to essentially
*  kick out the Speaker of the House and leave the Speakership vacant, meaning that as of
*  right now, there is no one in charge of the United States House of Representatives.
*  Right.
*  It feels worth pausing for just a moment to reflect on the enormity of that.
*  This is the most important member of the legislative branch, the United States House Speaker, third
*  in line to the presidency in the constitutional order of succession.
*  Suddenly, that person has been removed from office and the chamber itself has no speaker.
*  It's just hard to wrap your head around.
*  Yeah, it's never happened before in history for a reason because it is such a drastic
*  action to take.
*  It means that there was such dissatisfaction in the Congress with this speaker that they
*  went to this unprecedented step and decided they would be better off with no leader than
*  with Kevin McCarthy in charge.
*  Right.
*  So let's talk about how this happened because it didn't happen, as you have just hinted
*  over an ethical breach or an accusation of a crime, but because of a set of policy and
*  political differences.
*  So tell us the story of how this happened exactly.
*  And I think that means picking up where we left off with our colleague, Carl Hulse, on
*  Friday when we last checked in on this kind of rolling drama.
*  And at that moment, what we were all focused on was what appeared to be an all but certain
*  shutdown of the United States government.
*  Well let me take you back even a little further than that.
*  You have to go back to January where Kevin McCarthy with a very slim majority in the
*  House has to fight tooth and nail to even become speaker.
*  And in doing so, he had to make a number of promises to the hard right that already do
*  not trust Kevin McCarthy.
*  And a lot of them had to do with spending.
*  He had to promise to keep spending levels low.
*  He had to promise to pass individual appropriations bills instead of doing one big bill at the
*  end of the year.
*  He had to promise to give them 72 hours to review any materials.
*  And perhaps most importantly, he had to promise to allow any single member who didn't like
*  what Kevin McCarthy was doing to raise a motion to vacate to kick him out of the chair.
*  And so he makes all these promises.
*  And for a while, he's doing exactly what the hard right wants.
*  But there come a couple of times where he encounters situations that he thinks will
*  be too bad for the country.
*  The first is when the country was on the brink of defaulting on our debt.
*  And Kevin McCarthy cuts a deal with Democrats so that we don't default.
*  And we can keep paying the bills.
*  Right.
*  This was at the beginning of the summer.
*  Yes.
*  And supposing so, the hard right feels that he did not stand up enough for fiscal responsibility.
*  He didn't demand deep enough budget cuts.
*  And essentially, they believe he sold them out to the Democrats and broke their trust.
*  So that caused a deep wedge between Kevin McCarthy and these hard right Republicans.
*  And then the second time is what we encountered this past weekend, where the country was on
*  the brink of a government shutdown.
*  And Kevin McCarthy was forced with a very important choice.
*  Does he cut yet one more deal with Democrats, knowing he's already on very thin ice with
*  those hard right Republicans, to keep the government open?
*  Or does he go ahead and go into a government shutdown with all the problems that causes
*  for the country, which is what someone the hard right want?
*  And the presumption at the end of last week, as this shutdown loomed, and it was a presumption
*  I think we established pretty firmly in our last episode, was that Speaker McCarthy would
*  probably let the government shut down because he knew, as you've just said, that he has
*  previously betrayed the trust of these far right Republicans in the House.
*  And to do it again would truly risk inviting them to try to remove him as Speaker.
*  And so this time, he would probably choose his job over a fiscal crisis.
*  Yeah, that was a widespread assumption that many of us reporters had on the Hill.
*  We thought Kevin McCarthy was likely to allow the country to go into a government shutdown
*  that the far right had such a hold over him, he wouldn't defy them again.
*  But we were wrong.
*  Madam Speaker, I move that the House suspend the rules and pass...
*  McCarthy, to many people's surprise, cuts a deal with Democrats.
*  He puts a bill on the floor to keep the government open for the next month and a half.
*  The clerk will report the title of the bill.
*  H.R. 5860, a bill making continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2024 and for other purposes.
*  It does not have the deep cuts that Republicans wanted.
*  It does please a lot of Democrats who vote, almost all of them, for this bill.
*  On this vote, the yeas are 335, the nays are 91.
*  And so many more Democrats end up voting for this bill to keep the government open than
*  the Republicans do.
*  And the bill is passed.
*  And with that objection, the motion to reconsider is laid on the table.
*  You know, Kevin McCarthy makes this choice.
*  He said it's the right thing to do.
*  But for some of those hard right Republicans, he's now broken their trust a second time.
*  Right.
*  A government shutdown has been averted by what McCarthy did.
*  But he has very much poked the bear.
*  Absolutely.
*  The hard right is furious after McCarthy takes this step.
*  They start grumbling about what their next move will be.
*  And McCarthy is well aware of this, but he's actually defiant.
*  We were within a few hours of government shutting down.
*  He comes out, he tells reporters, there has to be an adult in the room.
*  If somebody wants to make a motion against me, bring it.
*  And he essentially says, bring it on to the hard right.
*  If you want to come for me and kick me out of my job because I did the right thing in
*  my view, then let's have that fight.
*  Because I believe in not giving up on America.
*  I'm not going to be beholden to somebody who portrays and does something different.
*  Right.
*  He's basically daring members of this group on the far right to try to oust him.
*  Yeah.
*  One of the ringleaders of the hard right Republicans, Matt Gaetz of Florida, is all too eager to
*  take him up on the challenge.
*  And you'll probably know Matt Gaetz from his many Fox News interviews.
*  He is one of Donald Trump's most loyal acolytes.
*  He loves the spotlight, loves cameras, and he's been a thorn in McCarthy's side for years
*  now.
*  The two of them don't like each other.
*  Matt Gaetz blames McCarthy for an ethics investigation into his conduct.
*  And so he is always looking for a reason that if he can mess with Kevin McCarthy, he's going
*  to do it.
*  And what exactly does Gaetz do?
*  So sure enough, Monday night, as soon as the Congress people have flown back to D.C. and
*  are entering the Capitol, that objection, the gentleman is recognized for one minute.
*  Matt Gaetz signs up to speak on the House floor and he carries a little binder of papers
*  in with him and he hands it up on the dais and announces,
*  Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2A1 of rule 9, I rise to give notice of my intent to raise
*  a question of the privileges of the House.
*  He will be bringing a motion to oust Kevin McCarthy from the speakership.
*  And he tells reporters,
*  Kevin McCarthy likes to pretend that he makes coalition with conservatives, but all he really
*  does is break his word with conservatives.
*  He says he's not sure he has the votes to do it, but he thinks Kevin McCarthy has lied
*  to conservative Republicans for too long.
*  Well, I have enough Republicans where at this point next week, one of two things will happen.
*  Kevin McCarthy won't be the Speaker of the House or he'll be the Speaker of the House
*  working at the pleasure of the Democrats.
*  And I'm at peace with either result because the American people deserve to know who governs
*  them.
*  Essentially, what he's done is started a clock that within the next 48 hours, the entire
*  Congress will have to vote on whether to keep McCarthy as Speaker or kick him out of his
*  job.
*  And so it brings up two real fundamental questions.
*  One, are there four Republicans willing to go along with Matt Gaetz?
*  Because Kevin McCarthy alienated five people so deeply, broken their trust so badly that
*  they're willing to kick out the leader of their own party in the House and essentially
*  have no speaker.
*  And then the second question is whether or not Kevin McCarthy has acted in a way that
*  is responsible enough that Democrats might step in and save him.
*  Maybe not vote for Kevin McCarthy, but maybe vote present or happen to be absent that day
*  where they would prefer to just keep a speaker in place rather than have the House plunge
*  into chaos.
*  What you're really asking is, is there any trust left in the United States House of Representatives
*  for Kevin McCarthy?
*  Right.
*  That was the question we didn't know the answer to on Monday night, but we would soon find
*  out on Tuesday.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Luke, describe exactly what happens on Tuesday as McCarthy's job hangs in the balance
*  and this open question looms, which is, will anybody save him?
*  Right.
*  McCarthy makes a decision that he doesn't want this vote hanging over his head for the
*  next 48 hours and that he wants to get this over with today.
*  So both the Democrats and the Republicans start at 9 a.m. Tuesday morning going into
*  their respective meetings to sort of figure out their next step.
*  And Luke, what would be the best, strongest possible argument for Democrats to back McCarthy
*  and basically save his speakership?
*  Well they were talking about this all weekend, knowing that this moment could come.
*  And another of Democrats made the argument that perhaps Kevin McCarthy is better than
*  any of the alternatives that Republicans could offer up.
*  You know, he avoided having a government shutdown.
*  He avoided defaulting on our debt.
*  For better or worse, has kept the institution largely running and perhaps a farther right
*  member of Congress would be even worse as speaker.
*  Right, he's the devil they know and the one who kept the government open.
*  Right, and perhaps they can extract some concessions out of Kevin McCarthy.
*  Maybe in exchange for them saving him, they'll get co-committee chairs.
*  Maybe he will give more money to Ukraine.
*  But Kevin McCarthy calls Hakeem Jeffries the leader of the Democrats Monday night and he
*  makes it clear that he's not willing to give the Democrats anything.
*  That the Democrats should vote for him because they should believe in the institution of
*  the House and not want to see it in chaos.
*  But he's not going to go out of his way to make any promises to any Democrat.
*  He doesn't offer them anything.
*  And so Hakeem Jeffries walks into the 9 a.m. morning meeting and he puts up on the screen
*  video of Kevin McCarthy on national TV bashing Democrats and implying in their view falsely
*  that Democrats were the ones who wanted the government shutdown.
*  And this infuriates the Democrats in that closed door meeting.
*  What could have been a debate over the pros and cons of cutting a deal with Kevin McCarthy
*  becomes essentially a one-sided speaking session of all of Kevin McCarthy's wrongs and ills.
*  Even the moderate members, the ones from districts in which President Trump is popular, were
*  saying Kevin McCarthy is untrustworthy.
*  People are talking about how he voted to overturn the election, how he was Donald Trump's lap
*  dog every step of the way, how he defied a subpoena from the January 6th committee.
*  Every single person who speaks at this closed door meeting speaks against saving Kevin McCarthy
*  and says that the Democrats must remain united.
*  And in their view, it would be better to have no speaker than to have Kevin McCarthy as
*  speaker.
*  So it's clear that he's not going to be saved by Democrats.
*  So then the only question becomes, will these hard-right Republicans truly follow through
*  with kicking him out of this job as speaker?
*  Because it's one thing to say you might do it, it's another to actually do it.
*  Absolutely.
*  Pursuant to clause 2A2 of rule 9, the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Gates, and the gentleman
*  from Oklahoma, Mr. Cole, will each control 30 minutes.
*  And this all comes to a head on the House floor during a really intense debate about
*  the future of the House and of Kevin McCarthy's speakership.
*  The overwhelming majority of my party supports the speaker that we elected.
*  We're proud of the leadership he's shown.
*  We're proud of the manner in which he's been willing to work with everybody in our conference
*  and I believe in this chamber.
*  Now remember, the vast majority of Republicans in the House are in favor of Speaker McCarthy.
*  There's only a handful who want to see him gone.
*  There's a second group.
*  Small group.
*  Honestly, they're willing to plunge this body into chaos and this country into uncertainty
*  for reasons that only they really understand.
*  I certainly don't.
*  So for the better part of an hour, Tuesday afternoon, Republican after Republican who
*  supports Kevin McCarthy gets up and makes the case for keeping Kevin McCarthy.
*  Kevin McCarthy has earned this under Speaker McCarthy's leadership.
*  Our House Republican majority has actually defied all odds and overperformed expectations
*  again and again and again.
*  They say he's passed conservative bills.
*  He has enacted tough oversight of the Biden administration.
*  On January 3rd, we said the 118th Congress is about three things.
*  Pass the bills that need passed, do the oversight work that needs to be done and stop the inevitable
*  omnibus that comes from the United States Senate right before the holidays.
*  Kevin McCarthy has been rock solid on all three.
*  They say he's kept his promises to conservatives, that he's put conservative people and conservative
*  committees and let them do their work.
*  So many Americans are better off because of Kevin McCarthy's leadership.
*  American families, job creators, entrepreneurs, service members, law enforcement officer,
*  and the list goes on and on.
*  But that's not at all the way Matt Gaetz and this handful of Republicans who have become
*  detractors of Kevin McCarthy view it.
*  Mr. Speaker, my friend from Oklahoma says that my colleagues and I who don't support
*  Kevin McCarthy would plunge the House and the country into chaos.
*  Chaos is Speaker McCarthy.
*  Chaos is somebody who we cannot trust with their word.
*  I don't think voting against Kevin McCarthy is chaos.
*  I think 33 trillion in debt is chaos.
*  I think that facing a $2.2 trillion annual deficit is chaos.
*  I think that not passing single subject spending bills is chaos.
*  I think the fact that we have been governed in this country since the mid 90s by continuing
*  resolution and omnibus is chaos.
*  They begin to say exactly how Kevin McCarthy has betrayed conservatives.
*  This body is entrenched in a suboptimal path and refuses to leave it.
*  Refuses to leave that path.
*  You cannot change if you're unwilling to change.
*  We had every opportunity to change.
*  We were promised change.
*  We were promised we were going to go ahead and we were going to get those 12 bills done.
*  Do you know why you do 12 bills?
*  Because it allows you to set an agenda to restore fiscal sanity.
*  We chose to not do it again.
*  Let's get our act together.
*  Let's get on with it.
*  Let's vacate the chair and let's get a better speaker.
*  I yield back.
*  Gentlemen, yields back is time.
*  All time for debate has expired.
*  Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the resolution.
*  And then we come to the final vote.
*  Right.
*  And it's a moment of high drama in the House.
*  The chair directs the clerk to conduct the vote by a call of the roll.
*  Instead of a traditional vote where everyone just presses their buzzer, this is a roll
*  call vote where every member will have to stand up after their name is called.
*  Adams.
*  Yes.
*  Yay.
*  And say how they are voting.
*  Aguilar.
*  Aye.
*  Yay.
*  And every single Democrat stands up and votes to oust Kevin McCarthy as speaker.
*  And everyone is counting the Republican votes.
*  Most of the Republicans are voting with Kevin McCarthy.
*  Biggs.
*  Aye.
*  Yay.
*  But then one votes against him.
*  Buck.
*  Aye.
*  Yay.
*  And then another.
*  Burchett.
*  Yay.
*  Yay.
*  And sooner or later, when it gets up to six, seven, and finally eight votes against Kevin
*  McCarthy from his fellow Republicans.
*  On this vote, the yeas are 216.
*  The nays are 210.
*  The resolution is adopted.
*  Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid on the table.
*  The Office of Speaker of the House of the United States House of Representatives is
*  hereby declared vacant.
*  Kevin McCarthy is done as the Speaker of the House.
*  So Luke, I want to talk about what this all means, both practically speaking and politically
*  speaking.
*  And I want to start with the practical side.
*  What now happens in the House with it no longer having a speaker?
*  What's the practical implication of that?
*  And what happens next?
*  Well, the short order is chaos.
*  No one has ever encountered this situation before.
*  There is no precedent for knowing what will happen next.
*  What we do know is because Kevin McCarthy was kicked out as speaker, the next tangible
*  that a temporary speaker has been put in place.
*  And Representative Patrick McHenry is now the acting temporary speaker of the House.
*  Patrick McHenry is a McCarthy ally.
*  He's very much a placeholder.
*  And the first thing he did was call a recess and say, let's try to figure out what we should
*  do.
*  As soon as Kevin McCarthy was kicked out, the Republicans retreated with Republicans
*  into their meeting.
*  The Democrats went off with Democrats into their meeting.
*  All that's consuming Capitol Hill right now is this crisis with the speakership and figuring
*  out who possibly could be the next leader of the House of Representatives.
*  So is there any type of speaker who could actually somehow navigate this dynamic and
*  this math we've been talking about?
*  Well, the hard right does have an answer to that, which is someone they can trust.
*  A couple of them have said, we don't necessarily mind Kevin McCarthy's policies all that much.
*  Is that we don't trust him personally.
*  And so we would take someone who votes and acts like Kevin McCarthy if he just didn't
*  mislead us and make false promises to us.
*  And so while that's their point of view, the other point of view is that trying to govern
*  those guys, those guys on the far right, is simply impossible.
*  They're always going to demand more.
*  They don't believe in government.
*  They want everything shut down.
*  The cuts they want would ruin the government and the economy.
*  And what they want is unreasonable.
*  And so as long as they hold sway over the House, no one can really govern it.
*  Right.
*  What you're hinting at is the reality that this is now an impossible job.
*  I mean, the story of Kevin McCarthy is of someone willing to endure 15 rounds of voting
*  and an excruciating set of side deals and promises to become speaker only to then lose
*  the job in under 300 days.
*  And for anyone else thinking of running for this job, the reality is now, if you upset
*  eight of them within the Republican ranks, you're going to be ousted.
*  Yeah, it's a job that many people don't want.
*  And once they saw what happened to Kevin McCarthy, I would bet even fewer people want it.
*  And so that is going to be the fight that we see over the next days.
*  And if you are the Democrats, how are you thinking about this moment?
*  Well, there's an old saw in politics, and that is if your opponents are shooting each
*  other, don't step in the middle of it.
*  And so I think the Democrats are happy to watch the Republicans devolve into chaos,
*  make the case very clear to voters that that party can't govern.
*  They're completely dysfunctional and keep their powder dry.
*  And eventually, maybe they have to step in and do something.
*  But for now, they're content to watch the Republicans flail and fail.
*  Luke, thinking back to the word you've used throughout this conversation, which is trust,
*  I wonder if on some level, the story of Kevin McCarthy's fall here is just as simple as
*  you cannot run the U.S. House of Representatives if you have lost the trust of everyone.
*  You have to have achieved trust with one side or the other.
*  And in the end, he didn't.
*  Well, you certainly need to maintain the trust of majority of the chamber.
*  And that's what Kevin McCarthy lost.
*  He tried to please the hard right, and then he would try to please the Democrats.
*  He made promises to one side and then broke those promises with separate promises to the
*  other side.
*  And so by trying to be all things to all people, he ended up alienating more people than he
*  won over.
*  And so at the end of the day, when a majority of the chamber, both Democrats and those hard
*  right members don't trust you as a speaker, you no longer have a job.
*  Oh, Luke, thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  On Tuesday night, House Republicans said they would leave Washington until next week with
*  no clear plan to pick a new speaker.
*  Despite speculation that he might seek to win back his job, Kevin McCarthy said he would
*  not stand for re-election as speaker and that he had no regrets about his approach to the
*  job.
*  I don't regret standing up for choosing governance over grievance.
*  It is my responsibility.
*  It is my job.
*  I do not regret negotiating.
*  Our government is designed to find compromise.
*  I don't regret my efforts to build coalitions and find solutions.
*  So I may have lost a vote today, but as I walk out of this chamber, I feel fortunate
*  to have served the American people.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  In a Delaware courtroom on Tuesday, President Biden's son, Hunter Biden, pleaded not guilty
*  to three felony charges in a case stemming from a years-long federal investigation into
*  his business dealings.
*  Hunter Biden has been charged with making false statements when he completed paperwork
*  to buy a handgun.
*  On those forms, Hunter Biden said that he was not using illegal drugs when, according
*  to prosecutors, he in fact was.
*  The case was supposed to be resolved through a plea deal that unraveled a few weeks ago
*  when it became clear that Biden and federal prosecutors could not agree on its terms.
*  If convicted, Hunter Biden could face up to 25 years in prison and hundreds of thousands
*  of dollars in fines.
