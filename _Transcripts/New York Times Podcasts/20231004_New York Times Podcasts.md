*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Barrow.
*  This is Adelaide.
*  Today, for the first time in American history, the United States House of Representatives
*  has voted to remove its leader.
*  My colleague, Luke Baudwater, was there as it happened.
*  It's Wednesday, October 4.
*  Look it's 5 p.m. on Tuesday night, and we come to you at a truly strange moment because
*  the United States House of Representatives has no speaker, right?
*  It is leaderless.
*  Yes.
*  For the first time in American history, the House of Representatives has voted to essentially
*  kick out the speaker of the House and leave the speakership vacant, meaning that as of
*  right now, there is no one in charge of the United States House of Representatives.
*  Right.
*  Those were pausing for just a moment to reflect on the enormity of that.
*  This is the most important member of the legislative branch, the United States House
*  speaker, third in line to the presidency in the constitutional order of succession.
*  Suddenly, that person has been removed from office, and the chamber itself has no speaker.
*  It's just harder out your head around.
*  It's never happened before in history for a reason because it is such a drastic action
*  to take.
*  It means that there was such dissatisfaction in the Congress with this speaker that they
*  went to this unprecedented step and decided they would be better off with no leader than
*  with Kevin McCarthy in charge.
*  Right.
*  Let's talk about how this happened because it didn't happen as you have just hinted
*  at over an ethical breach or an accusation of a crime, but because of a set of policy and
*  political differences.
*  Tell us the story of how this happened exactly.
*  I think that means picking up where we left off with our colleague, Carl Hals, on Friday
*  when we last checked in on this rolling drama.
*  At that moment, what we were all focused on was what appeared to be an all but certain
*  shutdown of the United States government.
*  Let me take you back even a little further than that.
*  You have to go back to January where Kevin McCarthy, with a very slim majority in the house,
*  has to fight tooth and nail to even become speaker.
*  In doing so, he had to make a number of promises to the hard right that already do not trust
*  Kevin McCarthy.
*  A lot of them had to do with spending.
*  He had to promise to keep spending levels low.
*  He had to promise to pass individual appropriations bills instead of doing one big bill at the end
*  of the year.
*  He had to promise to give them 72 hours to review any materials.
*  And perhaps most importantly, he had to promise to allow any single member who didn't like
*  what Kevin McCarthy was doing to raise a motion to vacate, to kick him out of the chair.
*  Right.
*  And so he makes all these promises.
*  And for a while, he's doing exactly what the hard right wants.
*  But there are a couple of times where he encounters situations that he thinks will be too bad
*  for the country.
*  The first is when the country was on the brink of defaulting on our debt.
*  And Kevin McCarthy cuts a deal with Democrats so that we don't default and we can keep paying
*  the bills.
*  Right.
*  This was at the beginning of the summer.
*  Yes.
*  And so the hard right feels that he did not stand up enough for fiscal responsibility.
*  He didn't demand deep enough budget cuts.
*  And essentially they believe he sold them out to the Democrats and broke their trust.
*  So that caused a deep wedge between Kevin McCarthy and these hard right Republicans.
*  And then the second time is what we encountered this past weekend, where the country was on
*  the brink of a government shutdown.
*  And Kevin McCarthy was forced with a very important choice.
*  Does he cut yet one more deal with Democrats knowing he's already on very thin ice with
*  those hard right Republicans to keep the government open or does he go ahead and go into a government
*  shutdown with all the problems that causes for the country, which is what someone the hard
*  right want.
*  Right.
*  And the presumption at the end of last week as this shutdown loomed and it was a presumption,
*  I think we established pretty firmly in our last episode was that Speaker McCarthy would
*  probably let the government shut down because he knew, as you've just said, that he has previously
*  betrayed the trust of these far right Republicans in the house.
*  And to do it again would truly risk inviting them to try to remove him as Speaker.
*  And so this time he would probably choose his job over a fiscal crisis.
*  Yeah, that was a widespread assumption that many of us reporters had on the hill.
*  We thought Kevin McCarthy was likely to allow the country to go into a government shutdown
*  that the far right had such a hold over him.
*  He wouldn't defy them again, but we were wrong.
*  Now Speaker, I move that the House has spent the rules and past McCarthy to many people
*  surprise cuts a deal with Democrats.
*  He puts a bill on the floor to keep the government open for the next month and a half.
*  The clerk will report that's hot all the bill.
*  HR 5860, a bill making continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2024 and for other purposes.
*  It does not have the deep cuts that Republicans wanted.
*  It does please a lot of Democrats who vote almost all of them for this bill.
*  On this vote, the age are 335.
*  The nays are 91.
*  And so many more Democrats end up voting for this bill to keep the government open than
*  the Republicans do.
*  And the bill has passed and with that objection, the motion to reconsider is laid on the table.
*  Kevin McCarthy makes this choice.
*  He said it's the right thing to do.
*  But for some of those hard right Republicans, he's now broken their trust a second time.
*  Right.
*  A government shutdown has been averted by what McCarthy did, but he has very much poked the
*  bear.
*  Absolutely.
*  The hard right is furious after McCarthy takes this step.
*  They start grumbling about what their next move will be.
*  And McCarthy is well aware of this, but he's actually defiant.
*  We were within a few hours of government shutting down.
*  He comes out, he tells reporters, there has to be an adult in the room.
*  If somebody wants to make a motion against me, bring it.
*  And he essentially says bring it on to the hard right.
*  If you want to come for me and kick me out of my job because I did the right thing in
*  my view, then let's have that fight.
*  Because I believe in not giving up on America, I'm not going to be beholden to somebody
*  who portrays and does something different.
*  Right.
*  He's basically daring members of this group on a far right to try to house them.
*  Yeah.
*  And one of the ring leaders of the hard right Republicans, Matt Gates of Florida is all
*  too eager to take him up on the challenge.
*  And you'll probably know Matt Gates from his many Fox news interviews.
*  He is one of Donald Trump's most loyal accolades.
*  He loves the spotlight, loves cameras.
*  And he's been a thorn in McCarthy side for years now.
*  The two of them don't like each other.
*  Matt Gates blames McCarthy for an ethics investigation into his conduct.
*  And so he is always looking for a reason that if he can mess with Kevin McCarthy, he's
*  going to do it.
*  And what exactly does Gates do?
*  So sure enough Monday night, as soon as the Congress people are flown back to DC and are entering
*  the Capitol.
*  That objection gentleman is recognized for one minute.
*  Matt Gates signs up to speak on the house floor and he carries a little binder of papers
*  in with him and he hands it up on the day us and announces.
*  Mr. Speaker pursuant to clause two a one of rule nine.
*  I rise to give notice of my intent to raise a question of the privileges of the house.
*  He will be bringing a motion to oust Kevin McCarthy from the speaker ship and he tells
*  reporters, Kevin McCarthy likes to pretend that he makes coalition with conservatives,
*  but all he really does is break his word with conservatives.
*  He says he's not sure he has the votes to do it, but he thinks Kevin McCarthy has lied
*  to conservative Republicans for too long.
*  Well, I have enough Republicans where at this point next week one of two things will happen.
*  Kevin McCarthy won't be the speaker of the house or he'll be the speaker of the house
*  working at the pleasure of the Democrats.
*  I'm at peace with either a result because the American people deserve to know who governs them.
*  Essentially what he's done is started a clock that within the next 48 hours,
*  the entire Congress will have to vote on whether to keep McCarthy as speaker or kick him out of his job.
*  And so it brings up two real fundamental questions.
*  One, are there four Republicans willing to go along with Matt Gates?
*  Has Kevin McCarthy alienated five people so deeply broken their trust so badly
*  that they're willing to kick out the leader of their own party in the house and essentially have no speaker?
*  And then the second question is whether or not Kevin McCarthy has acted in a way that is responsible
*  enough that Democrats might step in and save him. Maybe not vote for Kevin McCarthy,
*  but maybe vote present or happen to be absent that day where they would prefer to just keep a speaker
*  in place rather than have the house plunge into chaos. What you're really asking is,
*  is there any trust left in the United States House of Representatives for Kevin McCarthy?
*  Right. That was the question we didn't know the answer to on Monday night,
*  but we would soon find out on Tuesday.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So look, describe exactly what happens on Tuesday as McCarthy's job hangs in the balance and this
*  open question looms, which is, will anybody save him?
*  Right. Well, McCarthy makes a decision that he doesn't want this vote hanging over his head
*  for the next 48 hours and that he wants to get this over with today.
*  So both the Democrats and the Republicans start at 9 a.m. Tuesday morning going into their
*  respective meetings to sort of figure out their next step. And look, what would be the best
*  strongest possible argument for Democrats to back McCarthy and basically save his speakership?
*  Well, they were talking about this all weekend knowing that this moment could come.
*  And another of Democrats made the argument that perhaps Kevin McCarthy is better than any of the
*  alternatives that Republicans could offer up. You know, he avoided having a government shutdown,
*  he avoided defaulting on our debt. And for better or worse, has kept the institution largely running
*  and perhaps a farther right member of Congress would be even worse as speaker.
*  Right. He's the devil they know and the one who kept the government open.
*  Right. And perhaps they can extract some concessions out of Kevin McCarthy. Maybe in exchange for
*  them saving him, they'll get co-committee chairs. Maybe he will give more money to Ukraine.
*  But Kevin McCarthy calls Hakeem Jeffries, the leader of the Democrats Monday night.
*  And he makes it clear that he's not willing to give the Democrats anything.
*  That the Democrats should vote for him because they should believe in the institution of the House
*  and not want to see it in chaos. But he's not going to go out of his way to make any promises
*  to any Democrat. He doesn't offer them anything. And so Hakeem Jeffries walks into the 9am
*  morning meeting and he puts up on the screen video of Kevin McCarthy on national TV,
*  bashing Democrats and implying in their view falsely that Democrats were the ones who wanted
*  the government shutdown. And this infuriates the Democrats in that closed door meeting.
*  And what could have been a debate over the pros and cons of cutting a deal with Kevin McCarthy
*  becomes essentially a one-sided speaking session of all of Kevin McCarthy's wrongs and ills.
*  Even the moderate members, the ones from districts in which President Trump is popular were saying
*  Kevin McCarthy is untrustworthy. People are talking about how he voted to overturn the election,
*  how he was Donald Trump's lapdog every step of the way, how he defied us a pina from the January
*  6th committee. Every single person who speaks at this closed door meeting speaks against
*  saving Kevin McCarthy and says that the Democrats must remain united. And in their view,
*  it will be better to have no speaker than to have Kevin McCarthy as speaker.
*  So it's clear that he's not going to be saved by Democrats.
*  So then the only question becomes, will these parties, right? Republicans truly follow through with
*  kicking him out of this job as speaker because it's one thing to say you might do it. It's another
*  to actually do it. Absolutely. Pursuant to clause 2A2 of rule 9, the gentleman from Florida,
*  Mr. Gates, and the gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Cole, will each control 30 minutes.
*  And this all comes to a head on the House floor during a really intense debate about the future
*  of the House and of Kevin McCarthy's speakership. The overwhelming majority of my party
*  supports the speaker that we elected. We're proud of the leadership he's shown. We're proud of
*  the manner in which he's been willing to work with everybody in our conference and I believe
*  in this chamber. Now remember, the vast majority of Republicans in the House are in favor of
*  speaker McCarthy. There's only, you know, a handful who want to see him gone.
*  There's a second group, small group. Honestly, they're willing to plunge this body into chaos
*  and this country and uncertainty for reasons that only they really understand. I certainly don't.
*  So for the better part of an hour, Tuesday afternoon, Republican after Republican supports
*  Kevin McCarthy gets up and makes the case for keeping Kevin McCarthy. Kevin McCarthy has earned
*  this. Under speaker McCarthy's leadership, our House Republican majority has actually
*  defied all odds and overperformed expectations again and again and again.
*  You know, he said he's passed conservative bills. He has enacted tough oversight of the Biden
*  administration. For you, on January 3rd, we said the 118th Congress is about three things.
*  Past the bills that need past, do the oversight work that needs to be done and stop the inevitable
*  omnibus that comes from the United States Senate right before the holidays. Kevin McCarthy has been
*  rock solid on all three. They say he kept his promises to conservatives that he's put, you know,
*  conservative people and conservative committees and let them do their work. So many Americans are
*  better off because of Kevin McCarthy's leadership. American families, job creators,
*  entrepreneurs, service members, law enforcement officer, and the list goes on and on.
*  But that's not at all the way. Matt Gates and this handful of Republicans who have become
*  detractors of Kevin McCarthy, view it. Mr. Speaker, my friend from Oklahoma says that my colleagues
*  and I who don't support Kevin McCarthy would plunge the House and the country into chaos.
*  Chaos is Speaker McCarthy. Chaos is somebody who we cannot trust with their word. I don't think
*  voting against Kevin McCarthy is chaos. I think 33 trillion in debt is chaos. I think that facing a
*  $2.2 trillion annual deficit is chaos. I think that not passing single-subject spending bills is chaos.
*  I think the fact that we have been governed in this country since the mid-90s by continuing
*  resolution and omnibus is chaos. They begin to say exactly how Kevin McCarthy has betrayed
*  conservatives. This body is entrenched in a sub-optimal path and refuses to leave it.
*  Refuses to leave that path. You cannot change if you're unwilling to change. We had every
*  opportunity to change. We were promised to change. We were promised we were going to go ahead
*  and we were going to get those 12 bills done. Do you know why you do 12 bills?
*  Because it allows you to set an agenda to restore fiscal sanity. We chose to not do it again.
*  Let's get our act together. Let's get on with it. Let's vacate the chair and let's get a
*  better speaker. I yield back. Gentlemen, yields back as time. All time for debate has expired.
*  Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the resolution. And then we come to the final
*  right and it's a moment of high drama in the house. The chair directs the clerk to conduct the vote by
*  a call of the role. Instead of a traditional vote where everyone just presses their buzzer,
*  this is a row call vote where every member will have to stand up after their name is called
*  Adams. Yay. And say how they are voting. Aguilar. Yay. And every single Democrat stands up and votes
*  to Alstkevna McCarthy as speaker. And everyone is counting the Republican votes. Most of the
*  Republicans are voting with Kevin McCarthy. Bigs. Yay. But then one votes against him. Buck. Yay.
*  And then another. Birchett. Yay. And sooner or later when it gets up to six, seven and finally eight
*  votes against Kevin McCarthy from his fellow Republicans. On this vote, the yeas are two sixteen. The
*  resolution is adopted without objection. The motion to reconsider is laid on the table. The office
*  of Speaker of the House of the United States House of Representatives is hereby declared vacant.
*  Kevin McCarthy is done as the Speaker of the House.
*  So look, I want to talk about what this all means, both practically speaking and
*  politically speaking. And I want to start with the practical side. What now happens in the House
*  with it no longer having a speaker? What's the practical implication of that? And what happens next?
*  Well, the short order is chaos. No one has ever encountered this situation before. There is no
*  precedent for knowing what will happen next. What we do know is because Kevin McCarthy was kicked
*  out as Speaker. The next tangible step was that a temporary speaker has been put in place.
*  And representative Patrick McKenry is now the acting temporary speaker of the House.
*  Okay. Patrick McKenry is a McCarthy ally. He's very much a placeholder. And the first thing he did
*  was call a recess and say, let's try to figure out what we should do. So as soon as Kevin McCarthy
*  was kicked out, the Republicans retreated with Republicans into their meeting. The Democrats
*  went off with Democrats into their meeting. All that's consuming Capitol Hill right now is this
*  crisis with the speakership and figuring out who possibly could be the next leader of the House of
*  Representatives. So is there any type of speaker who could actually somehow navigate this
*  dynamic and this math we've been talking about? Well, the hard right does have an answer to that,
*  which is someone they can trust. A couple of them have said, we don't necessarily mind Kevin
*  McCarthy's policies all that much is that we don't trust him personally. And so we would take someone
*  who votes and acts like Kevin McCarthy if he just didn't mislead us and make false promises to us.
*  And so while that's their point of view, the other point of view is that trying to govern those
*  guys, those guys on the far right is simply impossible. They're always going to demand more. They don't
*  believe in government. They want everything shut down. The cuts they want would ruin the government
*  and the economy and what they want is unreasonable. And so as long as they hold sway over the House,
*  no one can really govern it. Right. I mean, what you're hinting at is the reality that this is now
*  an impossible job. I mean, the story of Kevin McCarthy is of someone willing to endure 15 rounds
*  of voting and excruciating set of side deals and promises to become speaker only to then lose the
*  job in under 300 days. And for anyone else thinking of running for this job, the reality is now,
*  if you upset eight of them within the Republican ranks, you're going to be ousted. Yeah, it's a job
*  that many people don't want. And once they saw what happened to Kevin McCarthy, I would bet even
*  fewer people wanted. And so that is going to be the fight that we see over the next days.
*  And if you are the Democrats, how are you thinking about this moment?
*  Well, there's an old saw in politics. And that is if your opponents are shooting each other,
*  don't step in the middle of it. And so I think the Democrats are happy to watch the Republicans
*  devolve into chaos, make the case very clear to voters that that party can't govern. They're
*  completely dysfunctional and keep their power dry. And eventually, maybe they have to step in
*  and do something. But for now, they're content to watch their Republicans flail and fail.
*  Luke, thinking back to the word you've used throughout this conversation, which is trust,
*  I wonder if on some level, the story of Kevin McCarthy's fall here is just as simple as you cannot
*  run the US House of Representatives if you have lost the trust of everyone. You have to have
*  achieved trust with one side or the other. And in the end, he didn't.
*  Well, you certainly need to maintain the trust of majority of the chamber. And that's what Kevin
*  McCarthy lost. He tried to please the hard right and then he would try to please the Democrats.
*  He made promises to one side and then broke those promises with separate promises to the other side.
*  And so by trying to be all things to all people, he ended up alienating more people than he won over.
*  And so at the end of the day, when a majority of the chamber, both Democrats and those hard
*  right members don't trust you as a speaker, you no longer have a job.
*  Oh, Luke, thank you very much. Thank you, Michael.
*  On Tuesday night, House Republicans said they would leave Washington until next week,
*  with no clear plan to pick a new speaker. Despite speculation that he might seek to win back his job,
*  Kevin McCarthy said he would not stand for reelection as speaker and that he had no regrets about his
*  approach to the job. I don't regret standing up for choosing government over grievance.
*  It is my responsibility. It is my job. I do not regret negotiating. Our government is designed
*  to find compromise. I don't regret my efforts to build coalitions and find solutions.
*  So I may have lost the vote today, but as I walk out of this chamber, I feel fortunate to have served the American people.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. In a Delaware courtroom on Tuesday,
*  President Biden's son, Hunter Biden, pleaded not guilty to three felony charges,
*  in a case stemming from a year's long federal investigation into his business dealings.
*  Hunter Biden has been charged with making false statements when he completed paperwork to buy a
*  handgun. On those forms, Hunter Biden said that he was not using illegal drugs. When according to
*  prosecutors, he in fact was. The case was supposed to be resolved through a plea deal that unravelled
*  a few weeks ago when it became clear that Biden and federal prosecutors could not agree on its terms.
*  If convicted, Hunter Biden could face up to 25 years in prison and hundreds of thousands of
*  dollars in fines. Today's episode was produced by Rachel Quester, Rochelle Bonja, Mary Wilson,
*  and Alex Stern. It was edited by Lisa Chao and Paige Cowatt, contains original music by Dan
*  Powell and was engineered by Alyssa Moxley. Our theme music is by Jim Rundberg and Ben Lanzberg
*  of Wonder Lane. Special thanks to Robert Jimmison.
