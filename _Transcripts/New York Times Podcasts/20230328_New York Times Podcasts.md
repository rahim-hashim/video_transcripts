# The Fight Over ‘Cop City’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M-7mDCF2eo)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Serena Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  We are opening our mouths and crying with a loud voice to say that we don't want
*  Cock City.
*  In a patch of wood southwest of Atlanta, protesters and the police have been clashing over a massive
*  police training facility that the city wants to build there.
*  This is a historic investment in public safety that will pay dividends in every community
*  that we have.
*  Earlier this month, that fight came to a head.
*  Demonstrators were armed with rocks and model-top cocktails.
*  Today, Atlanta-based reporter Sean Keenan on how the facility and the woods surrounding
*  it have become an unlikely battleground in the nation's debate over policing.
*  It's Tuesday, March 28th.
*  So Sean, tell me about this planned police training facility just outside Atlanta that's
*  become so controversial.
*  What's planned is 85 acres of training ground for police and firefighters, and it's going
*  to sprawl across forested land southeast of Atlanta and unincorporated to Cabb County.
*  The plan is expected to include a gun range, helipad, pasture land for police horses, classrooms
*  for police and fire training and amphitheater, and a racetrack for police to practice high-speed
*  chases and firefighters to learn how to drive fire trucks.
*  But what is probably the most contentious element of the whole plan is this mock city,
*  which is planned so the police can prepare for real-life scenarios like a mass shooting
*  or a robbery.
*  It'll have apartments, a gas station, a nightclub, a grocery store, a simulation zone.
*  How many other facilities are out there like this?
*  Relatively speaking, this is going to be one of the largest facilities of its kind in the
*  U.S. All said, we're talking about a $90 million investment.
*  Could even go over that.
*  $30 million of that is coming from the city, meaning taxpayers, and the other $60 million
*  is being covered by the Atlanta Police Foundation, which is really spearheading the development.
*  And it's seen as this culmination of years of concern about how to address this surge
*  in violent crime in Atlanta, which really spiked during the brunt of the pandemic, just
*  like it did in many other major cities.
*  This is being hailed by public officials as one of the primary answers to our crime troubles.
*  So this is a case from the city's perspective where the response is in proportion to the
*  scale of the problem, it sounds like.
*  Massive project, big surge in crime.
*  Yeah, sure.
*  I mean, like any major city, Atlanta watched crime jump during the pandemic.
*  I mean, each year for the past three years, the murder rates gone up.
*  We had 170 homicides in Atlanta just last year.
*  So how specifically did the city see this facility as an answer to those problems?
*  Well, so it's about a lot more than just the surge in violent crime.
*  The city has also been dealing with a drop in morale among its police force, especially
*  in the wake of recent racial justice protests.
*  So nationwide police morale plummeted and retention and recruitment took a hit after
*  the killing of George Floyd.
*  Then our former mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, kind of saw this training facility as a way
*  to reverse that problem.
*  If you have ever had an opportunity to visit either the police academy or the Atlanta Fire
*  Rescue Training Facility, they are simply deplorable.
*  She acknowledged that the facilities were really old and crummy.
*  The roof is leaking.
*  It has mold.
*  The list goes on and on.
*  But they also, you know, they needed some kind of carrot to dangle in front of current
*  officers, potential officers, anything to strengthen the police force at a time when
*  tensions were high.
*  We want our officers and the men and women who serve us at Atlanta Fire Rescue to have
*  a good attitude and disposition when they encounter us in our communities.
*  It's important that we live up to that end of the bargain as well.
*  We've talked about 21st century training, 21st century policing.
*  You can't do that in subpar facilities.
*  So at a time when citizen-police relationships are incredibly strained, this was seen as
*  a bridge for that gap.
*  And the city and the police foundation are also billing it as a potentially big moneymaker
*  because they plan to not just use it to train Atlanta police officers, but they will be
*  renting out the space to other jurisdictions outside the city, outside the state.
*  So there could be officers from around the country who come to train here.
*  OK, so the mayor sees this facility as a way to fix a few pressing issues simultaneously.
*  So what do Atlanta residents think of this plan?
*  Well, no two people are going to give you the same answer, but just about everybody
*  agrees we need to do something about crime and we need to do something about policing.
*  The plan started to materialize in September 2021, pretty shortly after it was made known
*  to the general public.
*  So the lease agreement with the Atlanta Police Foundation is headed to a city council vote,
*  but not before residents weighed in.
*  Like with any ordinance, they had to solicit public comment and in the throes of the pandemic,
*  they had people calling in.
*  More than 1,100 people phoned the city to let their voice be heard about the public
*  safety training facility, then ended up tallying over 17 hours of public comment.
*  What was supposed to be a regular city council meeting ended up stretching over two days.
*  Incredible. So what were people in Atlanta who cared about this enough to call in saying?
*  Well, obviously some people are in support of the plan.
*  They say we need a drastic response to what is a drastic crime search.
*  But there are a lot of people opposed.
*  There's folks who are worried about police militarization.
*  They think that they're already watching police forces become bigger and badder.
*  And they see this plan, especially for the mini city, as sort of a blueprint for this
*  police playground where they can dress up as soldiers.
*  There are also environmentalists who are adamantly opposed to this facility.
*  You know, Atlanta has been nicknamed the city in the forest because it has more tree canopy
*  than any major city across the country.
*  A lot of environmentalists have even nicknamed the South River Forest, which is where the
*  training facility is planned, one of the lungs of Atlanta because of its benefits to the
*  air and water quality across the city and even further.
*  The city says most of the forest is still going to be preserved, but it's also more
*  than that.
*  It's not just about policing.
*  It's not just about the environment.
*  There's a lot of middle ground in this Venn diagram where people are seeing this as what's
*  been called environmental racism, meaning this project is clear cutting right beside
*  a predominantly black neighborhood called Gresham Park, southeast of the city.
*  The police already have a gun range down the street from where the facility is planned.
*  And the neighbors are already frustrated by hearing gunshots in their backyard regularly.
*  Now they're thinking things could be getting louder.
*  And in theory, there are going to be even more police.
*  And a lot of the neighbors that I've spoken to don't want to think about police lurking
*  around every corner.
*  And the thinking among activists and opponents is that, you know, why is this city not going
*  to a wealthy white part of town to have their way with the ecosystem there?
*  So it sounds like two lines of opposition here.
*  One, you know, it's bad for the environment.
*  And then the other is that it dumps even more money into what looks like a more kind of
*  militaristic style of policing that's really been the focus of so much of the protests
*  in the past years.
*  And, you know, as you said, Sean, like those two things also come together in why is it
*  being put exactly here next to this majority black neighborhood?
*  So how did the vote go?
*  The plan passed with flying colors.
*  We did it by a 10 to 4 margin.
*  So all of a sudden, everybody who had been complaining about the deal felt like they
*  had just been shouting into the void.
*  And that's where things get really interesting.
*  Activists are attempting to block a new police training facility from being built by camping
*  out in the nearby woods and hiding out in tree houses.
*  And I think these reserves of rage, everybody needed an outlet.
*  They say the goal is to get enough people out there to make it impossible for the city
*  of Atlanta to move forward with its plans.
*  So some of them are organizing on social media.
*  Some of them are meeting privately.
*  And some people just start camping out in the woods protesting what they're derisively
*  calling cop city.
*  Atlanta police say that it is considered trespassing for the protesters and those living on that
*  property to remain there.
*  So first, there were a few of them moving out there camped out in tents and these makeshift
*  tree houses.
*  And then there are dozens of them.
*  And they create these old villages, you know, with houses and they're cooking and cleaning.
*  You know, they're picking up litter off the forest floor.
*  They're organizing food drives, little communes.
*  I talked to countless activists throughout my reporting on this story, and they seem
*  really committed to staying there.
*  Yes, there is community in the forest.
*  You have to take care of yourself in a way that you haven't when you live in a home with
*  running water and a toilet and easy access to food.
*  There's pretty much been some sort of encampment out there for the last 18 months in change.
*  How long are you willing to stay here?
*  I'm here for the campaign until this is dead and buried and that facility does not get built.
*  It really is at this point might sound like, oh, that's just the rowdy activists, you know,
*  trying to pump themselves up.
*  It's a matter of life and death for a lot of bodies that won't have a choice in the matter.
*  And you know, 18 months is a long time for a protest of this sort.
*  I've been covering racial justice activism in Atlanta for years, and I followed roving
*  protests around town for weeks at a time, but almost always they fizzle out.
*  But at the end of 2022, it seemed like most of the Stop Cop City protesters had sustained
*  a level of commitment and relative calm that was pretty striking.
*  And then in January of this year, everything started to change.
*  We'll be right back.
*  OK, Sean, tell us what happened in January.
*  So this forest occupation that started quietly really starts to increase in volume once protesters
*  start encountering construction crews and police who are there to get the land ready
*  for development.
*  And now law enforcement say that the protesters were attacking them with rocks and bottles
*  and malts off cocktails.
*  The protesters would contend that their movement has been by and large peaceful.
*  But it's not until January that things really come to a head during what police are calling
*  a forest clearing operation.
*  And on January 18th, one of those operations turns deadly.
*  And what happened exactly?
*  The accounts of law enforcement and the activists are entirely in conflict.
*  The Georgia Bureau of Investigations says that on January 18th, state troopers went
*  into an encampment and came across an activist whose name is Manuel Esteban Pais Teran.
*  Teran went by a nickname, Tortuguita, which means little turtle.
*  State troopers reportedly found Tortuguita sitting inside their tent and told the protester
*  to come out.
*  They refused, and so officers deployed pepperball rounds inside to try to smoke them out of
*  the tent.
*  Then they claim.
*  Tortuguita responded with gunfire, shooting through the tent at officers and hitting one
*  trooper in the belly.
*  State police say they have records of Tortuguita legally purchasing a handgun in 2020, and
*  they say ballistic forensics connect that gun to the bullet found in the trooper's belly.
*  An independent autopsy commissioned by the family found that Tortuguita had been shot
*  at least 13 times.
*  They saw it as a political assassination and they responded with drastic action.
*  I attended a vigil for Tortuguita and it was predominantly peaceful, and then a small group
*  of the few hundred that had shown up to a neighborhood in Atlanta splintered off and
*  marched down city streets, littering them with e-scooters and trash cans and essentially
*  just trying to stop traffic to draw attention to their cause.
*  Then there were more drastic actions where activists went out and attacked some of the
*  businesses and organizations that are affiliated with the Public Safety Training Center Plan,
*  like showing up at the Atlanta Police Foundation's headquarters, which is in downtown Atlanta,
*  and they broke the windows of the building and they shot fireworks off and they torched
*  a cop car.
*  So in other words, what was once a fairly peaceful demonstration has turned violent.
*  Yeah.
*  Then in late January and early February, they start cooking up a plan for what they're calling
*  a mass mobilization.
*  Now that they had more national attention, they encouraged people from across the country
*  and even across the world to converge on the South River Forest in a show of solidarity
*  and protest against the planned training facility.
*  And what was planned was, by all accounts, a festival.
*  And did people come?
*  Yeah, hundreds, probably more than a thousand were there at the forest when I was there
*  that weekend.
*  And where were they from?
*  If you walked through the gravel parking lot, you would see license plates from everywhere.
*  I know there were a few people there from other countries and they had art shows and
*  stand-up comedy and they had crafts that they did in the woods.
*  And it was just a festival, at least on Saturday.
*  When I showed up around 5 p.m. on Sunday, the mood was very different.
*  How?
*  What were you seeing at that point?
*  So to the left, I see what I expect to see, which is everybody just hanging out, sitting
*  by the makeshift stage, enjoying the music.
*  But to my right, there is this large crowd assembling, wearing mostly black and camouflage
*  and they're masking their faces.
*  All right.
*  To some extent, the festival is still going on.
*  So I pulled out my phone.
*  I wanted to show the world what I was witnessing, as is my job.
*  And as I'm panning from the peaceful activities to my left and going to the right, someone
*  lunges at me and tries to take my phone out of my hand.
*  And so I have to wrestle it away from them for a second.
*  I was clearly not welcome to hang out with that crowd.
*  And I decided one way or another, I'm going with them wherever they're going.
*  Let's just head in that direction.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  And then we start marching.
*  And so we're trekking up this hill through the tall grass and the mud.
*  And I could see at the top of the hill a chain link fence and, you know, little ant sized
*  people.
*  It dawned on me, OK, those are the police.
*  This is the Cop City site.
*  That is the main construction site at the moment for the training center project.
*  And as we get closer, what surprised me was the police run away.
*  And I'm wondering what the hell is about to happen.
*  And once we get to that chain link fence, the police have, for the most part, completely
*  fled.
*  They are closing the fence on the far side of the construction site.
*  And the activists ripped through that fence like a hot knife through butter.
*  Construction vehicles are up in flames.
*  There's a trailer for the construction crew about to be up in flames.
*  I see a, you know, some of these big yellow earth moving machines just like reduced to
*  a plume of smoke pretty quickly.
*  And the whole thing lasts just a few minutes.
*  It's just like a quick assault on this construction site.
*  And then they slip back into the woods, strip off their blackened camouflage, change into,
*  you know, regular festival goer clothes and try to insert themselves back into the festival.
*  But after a bit of an unnerving lull, the state police storm onto the property.
*  All right, cops are running.
*  And they begin making arrests.
*  That's tear gas, right?
*  They're tackling people left and right.
*  I'm doing my darnedest just to keep up with them.
*  You got eyes on this right here, please.
*  Looking into the tents now.
*  They're pulling people out of tents.
*  I was trying to follow along all the while.
*  The sun is going down.
*  And then police told me I had to get out of there.
*  Oh, God.
*  So, Sean, this scene is just very intense that you're describing.
*  What was the fallout from it?
*  Well, by the end of the night, law enforcement had detained dozens of activists and by morning,
*  23 of them had been arrested and charged with domestic terrorism.
*  Law enforcement officials here are saying because this is a government project,
*  building a training facility for law enforcement and these activists are trying to stop it,
*  they are effectively terrorists.
*  And these 23 people, most of them were from out of town.
*  I think only two were from Georgia.
*  Two were actually from outside the country.
*  We had one arrested who came here from France and another who came here from Canada.
*  And while the out of towners are probably getting most of the national spotlight for
*  the trouble they've gotten into, this is still very much a local movement.
*  Now, after the attack on the construction site in early March, maybe the activity at
*  the forest quieted down a little bit.
*  I think there was still an occupancy out there.
*  But the grassroots efforts elsewhere in the city were still very much alive.
*  I've now been on multiple marches through downtown and it was very loud and
*  very emotionally charged, but it was completely peaceful.
*  And so there's still plenty of people organizing and this movement is far from done.
*  Although whereas the forest has long been a flashpoint in the entire conversation,
*  DeKalb County officials just last Friday announced that through an executive order,
*  the park would be closed to the public.
*  So shutting it down completely from any activity.
*  Yeah, this in theory would take away a crucial foothold for the movement.
*  So Sean, has any of this changed the original plans for the police facility?
*  Yeah, I mean, the project has changed a little bit.
*  The city has afforded activists some concessions since the initiatives advent.
*  It started as a plan for a 150 acre training center.
*  It's been pared down to 85 acres.
*  Initially, there was supposed to be bomb detonation training.
*  That's not going to happen anymore.
*  But all said, the main bullet points of the project are very much the same.
*  And if you ask city officials or the police foundation, they'll tell you
*  there are no breaks on this train.
*  This development is happening.
*  The city is going forward.
*  Yeah, last week, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens announced that violent crime in the city,
*  homicides, rapes, aggravated assaults are all down, significantly down since this time last year,
*  which certainly had activists saying, well, see, maybe we don't need this facility.
*  But while like in a lot of major cities, the pandemic related surge in crime has started
*  to go down.
*  The fact remains that Atlanta is grappling with a serious crime problem.
*  So, Sean, the national conversation about policing has really taken a number of turns over the past few years.
*  You know, we had the protests on the streets in Ferguson, Missouri, and then, of course,
*  in Minneapolis.
*  And then out of that came the defund movement, which went into state houses all over the country.
*  And I think it's safe to say, you know, did not have resounding success.
*  So I'm thinking now about what's happened in Atlanta.
*  And what you see on this really local scale is this protest movement that managed to take a stand
*  for a whole year and a half, quite a long time, only to see it eventually spiral into violence and then face potentially being shut down by the authorities being kicked out of the forest.
*  So do you think that one way to see this whole story is as a case study in how hard it is for protesters to sustain their efforts with police reform?
*  Well, to be clear, the protest is not done yet.
*  I mean, police have repeatedly come to the forest and they've swept people out and they've arrested some of them.
*  And then soon after, activists just return and they're pitching tents again.
*  So no doubt they have had this sustained sense of determination for a long time.
*  But I think they're getting the sense of what they're up against.
*  This training facility carries with it this sort of sense of inevitability that reflects a much larger reality about the politics of law and order right now.
*  You know, the city of Atlanta says it's determined to respond to concerns about rising crime, even now as crime numbers are dropping.
*  And I think what the fight against cop city shows is just how hard it is to go up against that tide.
*  Sean, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Monday, an armed attacker walked into a Christian school in Nashville called Covenant and shot and killed three nine-year-old students and three staff members.
*  Police identified the assailant as a 28-year-old who lived in the Nashville area and was at one point a student at the school.
*  Nashville's police chief, John Drake, said the shooter, Audrey Hale, identified as transgender.
*  They said Hale entered the building through a side door armed with two assault rifles and a handgun and started firing.
*  Police officers who responded to the scene shot and killed Hale.
*  The adult victims were all in their 60s and included the head of the school.
*  President Biden spoke about the shooting, saying that the six deaths were, quote, sick and calling on Congress to do more to enact gun control.
*  And calling on Congress to do more to enact gun control legislation.
*  And federal authorities have finally found a buyer for Silicon Valley Bank, the California-based bank they seized on March 10th after a run on its deposits left it insolvent.
*  First Citizens Bank shares, a family-run bank in North Carolina, will buy the bank and its assets at a steep discount.
*  After the deal was announced, shares of midsize banks rose sharply.
