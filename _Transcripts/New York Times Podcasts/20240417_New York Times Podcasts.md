# Are ‘Forever Chemicals’ a Forever Problem?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_nvobgfzEY)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  This month for the first time, the Environmental Protection Agency began to regulate a class
*  of synthetic chemicals, known as Forever Chemicals, in America's drinking water.
*  But the chemicals, which have been linked to liver disease and other serious health
*  problems, are in far more than just our water supply.
*  Today, my colleague, Kim Tingley, explains.
*  It's Wednesday, April 17th.
*  So Kim, anytime the EPA announces a regulation, I think we all sort of take notice because implicit
*  in it is this idea that we have been exposed to something, something bad potentially, lead or
*  asbestos. And recently, the EPA is regulating a type of chemical known as PFAS. So for those who
*  don't know, what are PFAS chemicals?
*  Yeah, so PFAS stands for per and polyfluoroalkyl substances.
*  They're often called Forever Chemicals just because they persist so long in the environment and they
*  don't easily break down.
*  And for that reason, we also use them in a ton of consumer products.
*  They're in makeup, they're in carpet, they're in nonstick cookware, they're in food packaging, all
*  sorts of things.
*  Yeah, I feel like I've been hearing about these chemicals actually for a very long time.
*  I mean, nonstick pans, Teflon, right?
*  That's the thing that's in my mind when I think PFAS.
*  Absolutely. Yeah, this class of chemicals has been around for decades.
*  And what's really important about this is that the EPA has decided for the first time to regulate
*  them in drinking water.
*  And that's a ruling that stands to affect tens of millions of people.
*  So help me understand where these things came from and how it's taken so long to get to the point
*  where we're actually regulating them.
*  So they really actually came about a long time ago.
*  In 1938, DuPont, the people who eventually got us to Teflon, they were actually looking for a more
*  staple kind of refrigerant.
*  And they came upon this kind of chemical, PFAS.
*  The thing that all PFAS chemicals have is a really strong bond between carbon atoms and
*  fluorine atoms.
*  This particular pairing is super strong and super durable.
*  They have water repellent properties, they're stain resistant, they're grease resistant, and they
*  found a lot of uses for them initially in World War II.
*  They were using them as part of their uranium enrichment process to do all these kinds of
*  things. And then, well, good thing it's Teflon.
*  In the 1950s is when they really started to come out as commercial products.
*  Even burned food won't stick to Teflon, so it's always easy to clean.
*  So DuPont started using it in Teflon pans.
*  Cookware never needs scouring.
*  If it has DuPont, Teflon.
*  And then another company, 3M, also started using a kind of PFAS.
*  It keeps ordinary skills from becoming extraordinary stains.
*  And one of their big products, Scotchgard.
*  So you probably remember spraying that on your shoes if you want to make your shoes
*  waterproof.
*  Use Scotchgard, fabric protector, and let your cut runneth over.
*  Right, miracle product.
*  Scotchgard, Teflon.
*  But of course, we're talking about these chemicals because they've been found to pose
*  health threats. When does that risk start to surface?
*  Yeah, so it's pretty early on that DuPont and 3M start finding effects in animals and
*  studies that they're running in-house.
*  Around the mid-60s, they start seeing that PFAS has an effect on rats.
*  It's increasing the liver and kidney weights of the rats.
*  And so that seems problematic.
*  And they keep running tests, you know, over kind of the next decade and a half.
*  And they try different things with different animals.
*  In one study, they gave monkeys really, really high levels of PFAS.
*  And those monkeys died.
*  And so they have a pretty strong sense that these chemicals could be dangerous.
*  And then in 1979, they start to see that the workers that are in the plants
*  manufacturing, you know, working with these chemicals, that they're starting to have
*  higher rates of abnormal liver function.
*  And in a Teflon plant, they had some pregnant workers that were working with these
*  chemicals. And one of those workers in 1981 gave birth to a child who had some pretty
*  severe birth defects.
*  And then by the mid 1980s, DuPont figures out that it's not just their workers who are
*  being exposed to these chemicals, but communities that are living in areas
*  surrounding their Teflon plant, particularly the one in Parkersburg, West Virginia,
*  that those communities have PFAS in their tap water.
*  Wow. So based on its own studies, DuPont knows its chemicals are making animals
*  sick. They seem to be making workers sick.
*  And now they found out that the chemicals have made their way into the water supply.
*  What do they do with that information?
*  As far as we know, they didn't do much.
*  They certainly didn't tell the residents of Parkersburg who were drinking that water
*  that there was anything that they needed to be worried about.
*  How is that possible?
*  I mean, setting aside the fact that DuPont is the one actually studying the health
*  effects of its own chemicals, presumably to make sure they're safe.
*  We've seen these big regulating agencies like the EPA and the FDA that exist in order
*  to watch out for something exactly like this, right?
*  A company that is producing something that may be harming Americans.
*  Why weren't they keeping a closer watch?
*  Yeah, so it goes kind of back to the way that we regulate chemicals in the U.S.
*  It goes through an act called the Toxic Substances Control Act that's administered
*  by the EPA. And basically it gives companies a lot of room to
*  regulate themselves in a sense.
*  Under this act, they have a responsibility to report to the EPA, you know, if they find
*  these kinds of potential issues with the chemical, they have a responsibility to, you
*  know, sort of do their due diligence when they're putting a chemical out into the
*  environment. But there's really not a ton of oversight.
*  You know, the enforcement mechanism is that the EPA can find them.
*  But this kind of thing can happen pretty easily where DuPont keeps going with something
*  that they think might really be a problem.
*  And then the fine by the time it plays out is just a tiny fraction of what DuPont has
*  earned from producing these chemicals.
*  And so really, the incentive is for them to take the punishment at the end rather than
*  pull it out early.
*  So it seems like it's kind of just self-reporting, which is basically self-regulation
*  in a way. Yeah, I think that that is the way a lot of advocacy groups and experts have
*  characterized it to me is that chemical companies are essentially regulating themselves.
*  So how did this danger eventually come to light?
*  I mean, if this is in some kind of DuPont vault, what happened?
*  Well, there's a couple of different things that started to happen in the late 90s.
*  In the community around Parkersburg, West Virginia, people had reported seeing really
*  strange symptoms in their animals.
*  Cows were losing their hair.
*  They had lesions.
*  Well, they were behaving strangely.
*  Some of their calves were dying.
*  And a lot of people in the community felt like they were having health problems that
*  just didn't really have a good answer.
*  Mysterious sicknesses and some cases of cancers.
*  And so they initiate a class action lawsuit against DuPont.
*  As part of that class action lawsuit, DuPont, at a certain point, is forced to turn over
*  all of their internal documentation.
*  And so what was in the files was all of that research that we mentioned all of the studies
*  about animals, workers, the birth defects.
*  It was really the first time that the public saw what DuPont and 3M had already seen,
*  which is the potential health harms of these chemicals.
*  So that seems pretty damning.
*  I mean, what happened to the company?
*  So DuPont and 3M are still able to say, you know, these were just a few workers and they
*  were working with high levels of the chemicals, you know, more than a person would get drinking
*  it in the water.
*  And so there's still sort of an opportunity for this to be kind of correlation, but not
*  causation. There's not really a way to use that data to prove, you know, for sure that
*  it was PFAS that caused these health problems.
*  In other words, the company is arguing, look, yes, these two things exist at the same time,
*  but it doesn't mean that one caused the other.
*  Exactly. And so one of the things that this class action lawsuit demands in the settlement
*  that they eventually reach with DuPont is they want DuPont to fund a formal independent
*  health study of the communities that are affected by this PFAS in their drinking water.
*  And so they want DuPont to pay to figure out for sure using the best available science,
*  how many of these health problems are potentially related to their chemicals.
*  And so they ask them to pay for it and they get together an independent group of
*  researchers to undertake this study.
*  And it ends up being the first and it still might be the biggest epidemiological study
*  of PFAS in a community.
*  They've got about 69000 participants in this study.
*  Wow, that's big.
*  It's big. Yeah.
*  And what they ended up deciding was that they could confidently say that there was what
*  they ended up calling a probable link.
*  And so they were really confident that the chemical exposure that the study participants
*  had experienced was linked to high cholesterol, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease,
*  testicular cancer, kidney cancer and pregnancy induced hypertension.
*  Wow. And so those were the conditions that they were able to say with a good degree of
*  certainty were related to their chemical exposure.
*  There were others that, you know, they just didn't have the evidence to reach a strong
*  conclusion. So overall, pretty substantial health effects and kind of vindicates the
*  communities in West Virginia that were claiming that these chemicals were really
*  affecting their health. Absolutely.
*  And as the years have gone on, that was sort of just the beginning of researchers starting
*  to understand all the different kinds of health problems that these chemicals could
*  potentially be causing.
*  And so since the big DuPont class action study, there's really just been like this
*  building and building and building of different researchers coming out with these different
*  pieces of evidence that have accumulated to a pretty alarming picture of what some of
*  the potential health outcomes could be.
*  OK, so that really kind of brings us to the present moment, right?
*  When at last it seems the EPA is saying enough is enough.
*  We need to regulate these things.
*  Yeah, it seems like the EPA has been watching this preponderance of evidence accumulate
*  and they are sort of deciding that it's a real health problem potentially that they
*  need to regulate.
*  So the EPA has identified six of these PFAS chemicals that it's going to regulate.
*  But the concern that I think a lot of experts have is that this particular regulation
*  is not going to keep PFAS out of our bodies.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Kim, you just said that these regulations probably won't keep PFAS chemicals out of
*  our bodies. What did you mean?
*  Well, the EPA is talking about regulating these six kinds of PFAS, but there are actually
*  more than 10,000 different kinds of PFAS that are already being produced and out there in
*  the environment.
*  And why those six exactly?
*  I mean, is it because those are the ones responsible for most of the harm?
*  Those are the ones that the EPA has seen enough evidence about that they are confident that
*  they are probably causing harm.
*  But it doesn't mean that the other ones are not also doing something similar.
*  It's just sort of impossible for researchers to be able to test each individual chemical
*  compound and try to link it to a health outcome.
*  I talked to a lot of researchers who are involved in this area and they said that they
*  haven't really seen a PFAS that doesn't have a harm, but they just don't have information
*  on the vast majority of these compounds.
*  So in other words, we just haven't studied the rest of them enough yet to even know how
*  harmful they actually are, which is kind of alarming.
*  Yeah, that's right. And there's just new ones coming out all the time.
*  Right. OK, so of the six that the EPA is actually intending to regulate, though, are
*  those new regulations strict enough to keep these chemicals out of our bodies?
*  So the regulations for those six chemicals really only cover getting them out of the
*  drinking water. And drinking water only really accounts for about 20 percent of a
*  person's overall PFAS exposure.
*  Wow. So only a fifth of the total exposure.
*  Yeah, there are lots of other ways that you can come into contact with PFAS.
*  We eat PFAS, we inhale PFAS, we rub it on our skin.
*  It's in so many different products.
*  And sometimes those products are not ones that you would necessarily think of.
*  They're in carpets, they're in furniture, they're in dental floss, raincoats, vinyl
*  flooring, artificial turf, all kinds of products that you want to be either waterproof
*  or stain resistant or both have these chemicals in them.
*  So the cities and towns are going to have to figure out how to test for and monitor
*  for these six kinds of PFAS.
*  And then they're also going to have to figure out how to filter them out of the water
*  supply. I think a lot of people are concerned that this is going to be just a really
*  expensive endeavor and it's also not really going to take care of the entire
*  problem. Right.
*  And if you step back and really look at the bigger problem, the companies are still
*  making these things, right?
*  I mean, we're running around trying to regulate the stuff at the end stage, but these
*  things are still being dumped into the environment.
*  Yeah, I think it's like a huge criticism of our regulatory policy.
*  There's a lot of onus put on the EPA to prove that a harm has happened once the
*  chemicals are already out there and then to regulate the chemicals.
*  And I think that there's a criticism that we should do things the other way around.
*  Right. And so tougher regulations on the front end before it goes out into the
*  environment. And that's sort of what the European Union has been doing.
*  The European Chemicals Agency puts more of the burden on companies to prove that
*  their products and their chemicals are safe.
*  And the European Chemicals Agency is also right now considering just a ban on all
*  PFAS products.
*  So is that a kind of model, perhaps, of what a tough regulation could look like in
*  the U.S.?
*  There's two sides to that question.
*  And the first side is that a lot of people feel like it would be better if these
*  chemical companies had to meet a higher standard of proof in terms of demonstrating
*  that their products or their chemicals are going to be safe once they've been put out
*  in the environment. The other side is that doing that kind of upfront research can be
*  really expensive and could potentially limit companies who are trying to innovate in
*  that space. In terms of PFAS specifically, you know, this is a really important
*  chemical for us and a lot of the things that we use it in.
*  There's not necessarily a great replacement at the ready that we can just swap in.
*  And so, you know, it's used in all sorts of like really important medical devices or
*  renewable energy industries or firefighting foam.
*  And in some cases, there are alternatives that might be safer that companies can use.
*  But in other cases, they just don't have that yet.
*  And so PFAS is still really important to our daily lives.
*  Right. And that kind of leaves us in a pickle, right?
*  Because we know these things might be harming us, yet we're kind of stuck with them, at
*  least for now.
*  So let me just ask you this question, Kim, which I've been wanting to ask you since
*  the beginning of this episode, which is if you're a person who is concerned about your
*  exposure to PFAS, what do you do?
*  Yeah, so this is really tricky.
*  And I asked everybody this question who I talked to, and everybody has a little bit
*  of a different answer based on their circumstance.
*  For me, what I ended up doing was getting rid of the things that I could sort of spot
*  and get rid of. And so, you know, I got rid of some carpeting and I checked, you know,
*  when I was buying my son a raincoat that it was, you know, made by a company that didn't
*  use PFAS.
*  It's also expensive, right?
*  And so if you can afford to get a raincoat from a place that doesn't manufacture PFAS,
*  it's going to cost more than if you buy, you know, the budget raincoat.
*  And so, you know, it's kind of unfair to put the onus on consumers in that way.
*  And it's also just not necessarily clear where exactly your exposure is coming from.
*  So, you know, I talked to people who said, well, you know, it's in dust.
*  So I vacuum a lot or, you know, it's in my cleaning products.
*  So I use natural cleaning products.
*  And so I think it's really sort of a scattershot approach that consumers can take.
*  But I don't think that there is a magic approach that gets you a PFAS free life.
*  So, Kim, this is pretty dark, I have to say.
*  And I think what's frustrating is that it feels like we have these government agencies
*  that are supposed to be protecting our health.
*  But when you drill down here, the guidance is really more like, you know, you're on your own.
*  I mean, it's hard not to just throw up your hands and say, I give up.
*  Yeah, I think it's really tricky to try to know kind of what you do with all of this
*  information as an individual.
*  As much as you can, you can try to limit your individual exposure.
*  But it seems to me as though it's at kind of a regulatory level that meaningful change
*  would happen and not so much, you know, throwing out your pots and pans and getting new ones.
*  One thing about PFAS is just that we're in the stage still of trying to understand
*  exactly what it's doing inside of us.
*  And so there's a certain amount of research that has to happen in order to both convince people
*  that there's a real problem that needs to be solved and clean up what we've put out there.
*  And so I think that we're sort of in the middle of that arc.
*  And I think that that's the point at which people start looking for solutions.
*  Kim, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Tuesday, in day two of jury selection for the historic hush money case against Donald Trump,
*  lawyers succeeded in selecting seven jurors out of the 12 that are required for the criminal
*  trial after failing to pick a single juror on Monday.
*  Lawyers for Trump repeatedly sought to remove potential jurors whom they argued were biased
*  against the president.
*  Among the reasons they cited were social media posts expressing their views on the
*  former president and in one case a video posted by a potential juror of New Yorkers
*  celebrating Trump's loss in the 2020 election.
*  Once a full jury is seated, which could come as early as Friday, the criminal trial is
*  expected to last about six weeks.
