# LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Melbourne, AU
**Andrew Huberman:** [March 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttNxNbqNQK4)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
*  where we discuss science
*  and science-based tools for everyday life.
*  I'm Andrew Huberman,
*  and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
*  at Stanford School of Medicine.
*  Recently, the Huberman Lab Podcast hosted a live event
*  at the Plenary Theater in Melbourne, Australia.
*  The event was called the Brain-Body Contract
*  and featured a lecture
*  followed by a question and answer session with the audience.
*  We wanted to make the question and answer session
*  available to everyone, regardless if you could attend.
*  So what follows is the question and answer session
*  from the Plenary Theater in Melbourne, Australia.
*  I also would like to thank the sponsors for the event.
*  They are 8Sleep and AG1.
*  8Sleep makes smart mattress covers
*  with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
*  Now, one of the key aspects to getting a great night's sleep
*  is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
*  And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
*  your body temperature actually has to drop
*  by about one to three degrees.
*  And in order to wake up in the morning
*  feeling refreshed, your body temperature
*  actually has to increase by about one to three degrees.
*  8Sleep makes it extremely easy to control the temperature
*  of your sleeping environment at the beginning, middle,
*  and throughout the night and when you wake up in the morning.
*  I've been sleeping on an 8Sleep mattress cover
*  for nearly three years now,
*  and it has dramatically improved my sleep.
*  If you'd like to try 8Sleep,
*  you can go to 8sleep.com slash Huberman
*  to save $150 off their Pod3 cover.
*  8Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, UK,
*  select countries in the EU and Australia.
*  Again, that's 8sleep.com slash Huberman.
*  The other live event sponsor, AG1,
*  is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
*  that also contains adaptogens
*  and other critical micronutrients.
*  I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012,
*  so I'm delighted that they decided to sponsor the live event.
*  The reason I started taking it
*  and the reason I still take it every day,
*  once or twice a day,
*  is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas
*  for vitamins and minerals,
*  and it ensures that I get enough prebiotic
*  and probiotic to support gut health.
*  Now, of course, I strive to consume healthy whole foods
*  for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day,
*  but there are a number of things in AG1,
*  including specific micronutrients
*  that are hard to get from whole foods,
*  or at least in sufficient quantities.
*  So AG1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals
*  that I need, probiotics, prebiotics, the adaptogens,
*  and critical micronutrients.
*  To try AG1, go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman,
*  and you'll get a year's supply of vitamin D3K2
*  and five free travel packs of AG1.
*  Again, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman.
*  And now for the question and answer session
*  from Melbourne, Australia.
*  ["Drink AG1"]
*  Hey, Dr. Huberman, some of your listeners
*  are in or approaching our 50s, okay, same.
*  And are thinking of doing all we can to prevent dementia,
*  same.
*  Do you have any additional thoughts or protocols
*  or research we could focus on?
*  Yes, so, for the next two and a half hours,
*  I know I'm kidding, I'm not known for being succinct.
*  I didn't go over too much earlier.
*  So, okay, so ground truths.
*  So let's start with ground truths,
*  and then let's move to emerging.
*  Let's maybe get to a little bit of speculation.
*  Let's avoid conjecture.
*  Ground truths.
*  Blood circulation is good for the brain,
*  perhaps most important for the brain.
*  So anything that is good for cardiovascular health
*  is going to be good for brain health.
*  It's not the only thing, but that's true.
*  We know this.
*  So you hear these days a lot about zone two cardio.
*  I don't know who gets credit for that.
*  Peter Atiyah talks a lot about it.
*  I talk a lot about it.
*  None of us invented the notion, but 150,
*  probably more like 180 to 200 minutes
*  of so-called zone two cardio per week
*  is good numbers to shoot for.
*  Some of us get more, some of us less.
*  What is zone two cardio?
*  Zone two cardio is cardiovascular exercise.
*  Could be running, could be swimming,
*  could be walking, depending on your level of fitness,
*  which you can just barely maintain a conversation.
*  Were you to push any harder or faster,
*  you wouldn't be able to complete your sentences
*  with much ease, okay?
*  So is this zone two cardio for me?
*  No, but if I were to jog and try and have a conversation
*  at some point, I would have a little bit of a hard time.
*  That's zone two cardio.
*  So we know that's true.
*  Why?
*  Well, it seems to do a number of things
*  at the level of release of growth factors,
*  brain-derived nootrophic factor,
*  at the level of different, let's call them,
*  I realize the immunologists are gonna roll their eyes,
*  but anti-inflammatory cytokines and things of that sort.
*  You also have inflammatory cytokines and things of that sort.
*  It does seem that increasing blood flow
*  in and through the brain is important for brain health,
*  which is not all that surprising.
*  There are species of animals that spend part of their life
*  swimming about and then when they stop,
*  and stick to a rock or something,
*  a good portion of the nervous system actually degenerates.
*  But neurodegeneration and dementia
*  are not necessarily the same thing,
*  and this is something that we don't often hear about.
*  The age-related decline in memory capacity,
*  in particular working memory,
*  can be related to reductions
*  in dopamine transmission in the brain.
*  So things that increase the catecholamines
*  that we talked about earlier.
*  This could be pharmacology, of course,
*  but it doesn't have to be pharmacology.
*  It could be anything that increases the catecholamines.
*  And we talk about this on the podcast.
*  We have zero-cost protocols
*  that you don't have to sign up for.
*  You can just go to our website
*  and go to dopamine regulation
*  and it will list out ways to increase the catecholamines
*  through zero-cost and very low-cost ways.
*  We are known to improve working memory.
*  Working memory, of course,
*  the capacity to maintain a string of numbers
*  or information for sake of kind of immediate goals,
*  but not information that's passed to the longer-term memory.
*  So that's different than neurodegeneration.
*  That's simply reductions in the amount of neuromodulators,
*  like dopamine, being deployed as we get older.
*  So modulating dopamine through healthy, ideally, means.
*  But I do think we are going to see an increase
*  in the use of selective pharmacology for this purpose.
*  And here I'm not recommending anyone do drugs or take drugs,
*  prescription or otherwise.
*  But it does seem that certain compounds,
*  like nicotine, believe it or not,
*  even though it increases vasoconstriction
*  and blood pressure, can offset some
*  of the age-related reductions in dopaminergic
*  and cholinergic acetylcholine, cholinergic transmission.
*  And you don't want to smoke, vape, dip or snuff.
*  I'm not even recommending people take Zin patches,
*  but I think there is some use cases
*  for nicotine provided you're doing it
*  with your physician knows,
*  and you're not getting into dangerous blood pressure range
*  or supplementation with choline donors
*  and things of that sort,
*  to increase acetylcholine and dopamine.
*  Some people are starting to take things like modafinil
*  and Adderall in older age.
*  Keep in mind these are not modafinil,
*  but Adderall, Vyvanse, et cetera.
*  These are amphetamines.
*  They're amphetamines.
*  I'm not recommending this,
*  but I think that's where we're headed.
*  I think you're going to see a number
*  of different cognitive enhancers that are used
*  to offset some age-related cognitive decline, aka dementia.
*  Now in terms of, so we're going zone two cardio
*  like prescription drugs, we're kind of bracketing here,
*  and then behavioral protocols
*  that can increase neuromodulators,
*  such as the catecholamines.
*  Now in terms of other things
*  that can perhaps decrease the likelihood of Alzheimer's
*  and other forms of dementia
*  as it relates to neurodegeneration,
*  currently there are a lot of do nots.
*  Don't hit your head too hard.
*  If you hit it really hard, don't hit it again hard.
*  The so-called two-hit model, literally.
*  And we think of football, or I guess rugby,
*  that's the sport you guys play down here
*  where they use the head as a battering ram.
*  I've seen this, right?
*  Some big necks on those kids, and then there's boom.
*  And they, yeah, but the problem is not necessarily
*  just rugby or American football or Australia.
*  I was told that, someone told me I had to shout out
*  an Australian football team, and I know it's a setup,
*  so I'm not gonna do it.
*  They're like, when you're in Melbourne tomorrow,
*  you gotta say that your favorite team is blank,
*  and I'm like, this feels really dangerous.
*  So I'm not gonna do it.
*  I'm not gonna do it.
*  But, what's that?
*  Do it.
*  I can't remember the name of the team, so.
*  But I watched the document.
*  What's that?
*  But I still don't understand the rugby thing.
*  Do they use the guy's head or gal's head as a battering ram?
*  Because they used to play at UCSD outside my lab.
*  We had this big field, and my bulldog loved watching.
*  He was like, this sport makes sense.
*  But they were just like, run, and then the,
*  I never understood it, but anyway.
*  What's that?
*  Got it.
*  I need a translator, sorry.
*  I need a translator.
*  But I love the enthusiasm.
*  So we think about head injuries and brain injuries
*  mostly in the context of sport,
*  but that's not where most of the head injuries occur.
*  Most of them occur construction workers, car accidents,
*  TBI, things of that sort.
*  There's some interesting data on hyperbaric chambers.
*  This is getting really into the high level stuff here,
*  meaning most people don't have access to them.
*  I have a lot of information on that,
*  but I don't have access to them.
*  I look forward to learning more.
*  These are playing with different concentrations of oxygen
*  in a little microenvironment for traumatic brain injury
*  and neurodegeneration.
*  Do I think in five years that everyone's gonna be sitting
*  in hyperbaric chambers in order to offset neuron loss?
*  Probably not, I think it's not cost effective.
*  But I will say that most of the things
*  that are good for the body are good for the brain,
*  keeping anything that plaques the arteries,
*  capillaries and veins of the brain
*  because it's so heavily vascularized, minimal,
*  and minding those neuromodulators.
*  Obviously drugs of abuse like methamphetamine
*  can deplete dopamine neurons.
*  The data on MDMA, by the way,
*  I don't know, there's drug enforcement in the room.
*  The data, you know where they have most of the safety data
*  or lack of safety data in some cases on MDMA?
*  Keep in mind, MDMA, ecstasy,
*  is methylene-dioxymethamphetamine.
*  Methamphetamine, we know, causes neurodegeneration.
*  No question.
*  It also causes bad teeth.
*  Do you know how?
*  Do you know how?
*  It turns people into mouth breathers.
*  Dry mouth and the teeth degenerate.
*  Yeah, we have an episode on oral health coming out.
*  This is real.
*  That's actually why the teeth degenerate
*  is from excessive dry and it limits saliva production.
*  Saliva is very important for remineralization of the teeth.
*  Shout out to the dentists in the house.
*  So the thing about MDMA is interesting
*  because it turns out that MDMA,
*  because it also, it increases dopamine
*  just as methamphetamine does.
*  Remember, MDMA, methylene-dioxymethamphetamine,
*  but also huge increases in serotonin
*  seem to be most of the effect of MDMA,
*  the kind of empathogenic effect.
*  There was a study done of people
*  from the LDS, Latter-day Saints,
*  sometimes referred to as Mormons.
*  Why was the study on MDMA done
*  with people from the LDS community?
*  And I don't want to imply that everyone
*  from the LDS community does MDMA, but why?
*  They're a very interesting test population
*  because they don't do other drugs.
*  But for some reason, MDMA is not on the no-fly list.
*  So it's a beautiful paper
*  in which they took people who had only done as any drug,
*  and they're not even taking caffeine, right?
*  Either once or semi-frequent or very frequent use of MDMA,
*  and they did a bunch of cognitive testing.
*  And there were some attention issues
*  when people had taken over what was a couple hundred doses
*  of MDMA at the 80-milligram dose or more,
*  but it doesn't seem to be much neurodegeneration,
*  which is not to say that it's all safe.
*  There is an abuse and addictive potential there.
*  The biggest issue seems to be contamination of batches.
*  We have a fentanyl issue in the US.
*  I don't know if it's happening down here as well.
*  Very concerning.
*  Okay, so the point here is that I think very soon
*  you're going to hear about drugs,
*  prescription drugs and supplements
*  to augment the release of neuromodulators,
*  not for the sake of empathogenic states or psychedelic states,
*  but to try and keep those dopaminergic neurons online
*  to offset dementia,
*  because that's what the question's about.
*  In fact, there's a Nobel Prize-winning neuroscientist
*  at Columbia University, whose name I won't tell you,
*  or maybe I will, who, when I went to visit his office,
*  chewed no fewer than five pieces of Nicorette
*  in the course of a half an hour.
*  And I'm like, what's going on?
*  He's got a Nobel Prize, but this looks kind of pathologic.
*  And I said, why?
*  And he said, well, the nicotine is to offset
*  age-related loss of dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons.
*  I thought, really?
*  He's like, yeah, I quit smoking
*  because I didn't want lung cancer, but this is him.
*  This is the ANIC data.
*  I'm not suggesting you do this.
*  I think there are a number of things that we can do,
*  but protect those neuromodulators,
*  keep perfusion, that is blood flow to the brain, strong.
*  There's a case for cardiovascular exercise,
*  and it does seem, it really does seem,
*  that exercise that engages the neuromuscular connections
*  more than cardiovascular exercise,
*  so not just resistance training,
*  but anything that involves coordinated bodily training,
*  learning new physical skills, dance, et cetera,
*  really does seem to offset some of the loss
*  of cognitive functioning in adults.
*  So it's kind of interesting that physical exercise
*  is great for cognition, and probably cognition
*  may or may not help physical ability,
*  but one probably can imagine why
*  there's a bi-directional relationship there.
*  Your nervous system doesn't really distinguish
*  between physical and cognitive.
*  It's all working as a bunch of functional units.
*  I could go on and on about this,
*  but hopefully that at least gets your,
*  the gears turning around, some things that perhaps
*  you've heard about and some things that you haven't.
*  And we'll do an episode on dementia
*  and offsetting dementia in order to get into
*  some of the fine details.
*  Okay.
*  Can we increase our willpower,
*  just like training a muscle group,
*  with your research into the AMCC?
*  Ooh, I'm so glad that you mentioned the AMCC.
*  I think of all the new areas of neuroscience research
*  that are out there, I think the anterior
*  mid-singulate cortex is one of the most interesting
*  structures and areas of research nowadays.
*  You know, I think if I have my way,
*  then not only will most people have heard of dopamine
*  and the amygdala, I guess you need a Star Wars character
*  named after your brain part.
*  Isn't there one?
*  I only saw the first three.
*  I'm of that generation.
*  But isn't there an Amy Dala or something?
*  Yeah, right?
*  Don't leave me hanging here.
*  Is there or not?
*  If I'm wrong, just say no.
*  Okay, anyway, the amygdala, thanks.
*  The amygdala is a brain structure that is involved
*  in threat detection and novelty detection, not just threats.
*  The anterior mid-singulate cortex is an area of the brain
*  that we know is activated.
*  Well, let me tell you the best experiment.
*  The best experiment was done, in my opinion,
*  by a neurosurgeon at Stanford, Joe Parvizzi.
*  He's probing around in people's brains.
*  They got a little piece of skull missing.
*  He's stimulating in the brain.
*  He's asking them questions.
*  How do you feel?
*  What's going on?
*  How do you feel?
*  What's going on?
*  He's got an electrode in the anterior mid-singulate cortex.
*  And the patient says,
*  I feel like something really bad's gonna happen.
*  Like a storm is coming.
*  He's like, okay, well, we can stop stimulating.
*  He's like, no, I'm going into the storm.
*  That's interesting.
*  Stimulate a little bit further back,
*  just by a millimeter or so,
*  completely different subjective experience for the patient.
*  That's interesting.
*  Get a different patient in there,
*  map to the anterior mid-singulate cortex, stimulate.
*  And the person says,
*  I feel like I'm gonna get out of my chair
*  and I'm gonna do something hard.
*  Wild, right?
*  This is prior to any knowledge
*  of what the anterior mid-singulate cortex is doing.
*  Make a long story short,
*  people who successfully overcome a physical challenge,
*  a cognitive challenge, that learn a new skill,
*  that successful dieters, I don't really like that term,
*  their anterior mid-singulate cortex grows
*  or becomes more active under conditions
*  that challenge the anterior mid-singulate cortex.
*  So this brain region seems to be the brain region
*  that puts us in a forward center of mass,
*  physically and sort of cognitively and emotionally.
*  I often like to think that the nervous system,
*  as sophisticated as it is in psychology,
*  as sophisticated as it is, excuse me,
*  can be binned into kind of three categories.
*  Things that we like to eat or don't like to eat
*  or can kind of be binned into yum, yuck, or meh.
*  That's kind of what the nervous system has to do
*  because ultimately you have to decide,
*  do I want to go toward it, so-called repetitive behavior,
*  do I want to get away from it?
*  I only do nothing.
*  People were either like, yum, or some cases yum, yuck,
*  or in some cases like, ugh, or like meh.
*  Yum, yuck, meh.
*  This is the sort of three tributaries
*  that we have the option of moving down,
*  not moving down, or moving away from.
*  So the anterior mid-singulate cortex,
*  because it has inputs from so many different areas
*  and outputs to so many different areas,
*  it can access circuits related to dopamine, norepinephrine,
*  it can access circuits related to memory and context.
*  It's a hub, it's a hub that by all views
*  through all lenses of the existing research
*  suggests that anytime we do something truly challenging,
*  in particular things that we do not enjoy, this is key,
*  the anterior mid-singulate cortex
*  undergoes some sort of plasticity.
*  Everything in the research data now points to the idea
*  that the anterior mid-singulate cortex
*  is the seat of so-called willpower,
*  which is linked to concepts like tenacity or grit, et cetera.
*  And what I love about this research
*  is that it comes from a bunch of different areas,
*  human brain imaging, brain stimulation, et cetera.
*  Here's what I don't like about the reality,
*  but that we all need to accept,
*  which is that the anterior mid-singulate cortex
*  is modifiable by experience, by leaning into challenges
*  at any stage of life.
*  That's great, we talked about that earlier, plasticity.
*  But lest we forget, plasticity goes in the other direction,
*  too.
*  It seems that when we don't engage in challenges,
*  that the anterior mid-singulate cortex,
*  it does an atrophy, but it undergoes
*  sort of a downshift in activation.
*  Now, here's what's really, really interesting
*  and relates to the previous question.
*  The anterior mid-singulate cortex
*  seems to be especially active at baseline
*  and available for plasticity in what are called superagers.
*  We've all heard of blue zones.
*  The superagers are these people
*  who they don't just exist in blue zones.
*  They're spread around the world.
*  These are people that seem, at least by cognitive measures
*  and other physiological measures of the body,
*  seem to age extremely slowly.
*  So they shouldn't really be called superagers, right?
*  They should be called super non-agers.
*  Anyway, the anterior mid-singulate cortex
*  seems to be hyperactive in these superagers
*  as they're called.
*  And so it seems that not only do they maintain
*  cognitive function later in life,
*  but that seems to be related to their regular engagement
*  in challenging things.
*  So remember for so many years we heard,
*  okay, like nuns don't get dementia,
*  and then there's all sorts of things you can imagine
*  could be related to that.
*  And then we're thinking, oh, maybe it's crossword puzzles.
*  It was crossword puzzles.
*  Maybe it's hanging out with other people.
*  And then you know that person down the street
*  and she's cycling on the weekends like crazy,
*  and she's 90, and she looks like she's 50,
*  and she's sharp as a tack.
*  It's probably leaning into challenge on a regular basis.
*  Leaning into challenge on a regular basis
*  as opposed to one specific cognitive or physical thing,
*  which means that if you love cycling,
*  or you love the cold plunge,
*  or you love a certain form of exercise,
*  it's probably not doing that much
*  for your anterior mid-singulate cortex.
*  But these superagers also live longer.
*  And so there is this notion that because
*  the anterior mid-singulate cortex has connectivity
*  to a lot of areas of the brain and body
*  that it is somehow linked to the will to live.
*  And this is being examined now
*  in so-called terminal cancer patients,
*  so-called terminal cases, I don't like the language,
*  because there are these amazing instances,
*  and physicians and oncologists have known this
*  for a long time, that when people decide
*  they're gonna fight cancer,
*  they don't always win that fight, unfortunately,
*  but oftentimes it's the people who insist
*  on fighting it psychologically,
*  that they won't give in, that end up
*  still living more months, more years,
*  and in some cases, putting the cancer into remission,
*  with of course, other tools, right?
*  I'm not saying you shouldn't use other tools
*  to combat cancer.
*  So very interesting structure relates
*  to the question on dementia.
*  Hopefully that was informative.
*  Julian, thank you.
*  How would you recommend shift workers
*  to minimize the effects of disruption
*  to their circadian rhythm?
*  Oh, this is so important, you know why?
*  Because like right now, 9.40, eh, 9.40 p.m.,
*  we're kind of doing shift work right now.
*  Most people are on a shift work schedule now in the world.
*  This is true.
*  We think of shift workers as only the people
*  who are up in the middle of the night
*  and sleeping during the day,
*  but most people are doing shift work.
*  The criteria for shift work is at least a two hour,
*  at least in the U.S., a two hour variance
*  in the sleep-wake cycle, more than three nights a week.
*  Anyone here go to sleep every night same time,
*  wake up every morning same time,
*  never stay up later than that, more than two nights a week?
*  Okay, most people are doing shift work nowadays.
*  They're just on their phone or they're on their computer.
*  And I'm not going to argue that's, you know,
*  you shouldn't, many times that's me as well.
*  So here's what we do know,
*  and we did a whole episode on shift work,
*  but I'll try and summarize some of the key points.
*  You want to have your cortisol elevated early in the day
*  and then subside across the day.
*  That's the ideal pattern of cortisol release.
*  Cortisol is a great thing when it's high
*  and then tapers off from early day into the later day.
*  It's a bad thing if that cortisol peak is shifted late.
*  That cortisol peak is coming every 24 hours.
*  You don't have a choice.
*  Question is, is it going to be early day
*  or is it going to be late day?
*  Late day cortisol peaks are associated
*  with depression and anxiety.
*  This was done by my colleague, David Spiegel
*  and the great Robert Sapolsky at Stanford.
*  I study about that.
*  Robert, another great beard.
*  Amazing.
*  I always thought it was to blend in with the species
*  that he studies because he was like the baboon guy.
*  You know, I haven't quite figured out how to master that one.
*  You know, like the cuttlefish look,
*  but working on it, working on it.
*  Maybe I just have to sit down.
*  Nevermind, there's a story about,
*  you remember the earlier story?
*  The cuttlefish may, anyway, nevermind.
*  Again, this is why I don't like to speak too late in the day.
*  I can get myself into trouble.
*  But the point here is that having that cortisol peak
*  early in the day sets you up for mood focus and alertness,
*  immune system function in a really great way.
*  Shift workers have a serious problem,
*  which is that late peaks in cortisol
*  are kind of paramount in all forms of shift work.
*  And so what you need to do is to put yourself,
*  ideally, in lighting conditions that limit the amount
*  of blue light coming in at night,
*  or when you're doing that shift work.
*  Now, you have to do your work.
*  And I think in the next two years, if I have my way,
*  one idea that I'd like to embed in people's minds is,
*  you know, we hear a lot now about how hyper-processed foods
*  and highly processed foods are bad for us.
*  Sort of empty calories.
*  What are empty calories?
*  It's foods that are very calorie-dense
*  but micronutrient poor, right?
*  That's what it really is.
*  It's also the quality of food issues,
*  and people get, you know, like,
*  let's please not have the seed oil debate.
*  It's like, people get really into this,
*  and it's unclear to me still, and okay.
*  But we sort of think of empty calories
*  like alcohol, sugar, et cetera.
*  Calorie-dense, micronutrient poor.
*  Light can be viewed in much the same way.
*  These days, we live in a very blue light-rich world.
*  Lot of blue light.
*  So short wavelength light, blue light, UV light.
*  And by the way, in sunlight, especially down here,
*  it's very UV-rich, blue, which is great during the day,
*  especially when it's offset, or sorry,
*  when it includes long wavelength light, full spectrum light.
*  By the way, for everyone that's obsessed with red light,
*  and I love red light and red light therapies,
*  remember, the best source of red light is the sun.
*  It's full spectrum light.
*  It includes red.
*  It's just there's a bunch of other stuff in there too,
*  so it doesn't look like a red light panel.
*  That said, if you are going to do shift work,
*  one of the best things you can do,
*  and it's been shown to reduce cortisol levels at night
*  while you're doing that shift work,
*  is to filter out some of the blue.
*  So that is a use case for blue blockers,
*  or even for glasses that put you into more reddish conditions,
*  provided you can still do the work you need to do safely.
*  You will see a dramatic reduction in cortisol
*  under those conditions.
*  This blue and UV pathway,
*  picked up by a certain set of neurons in the eye,
*  all the intrinsic photosensitive melanopsin cells, et cetera,
*  is a real thing, and it's designed to activate you.
*  This is why so-called seasonal affective disorder lamps,
*  sad lamps, are basically bright blue-white-ish light.
*  So when you're doing that shift work,
*  if you can get into red or orange or amber light conditions,
*  that's great.
*  You can do this very inexpensively, by the way,
*  by just getting some party lights.
*  It doesn't have to be any fancy red light.
*  This is not talking about red light panels.
*  The other thing, of course,
*  is when you get back to your non-work environment,
*  you need to do some work to think about
*  when is best to sleep, when is not best to sleep.
*  Is it best to sleep all day and be up all night,
*  or get that sunlight in the morning?
*  And I talk about that in the shift work episode,
*  and I'm tempted to go down that rabbit hole now,
*  but I would just encourage you
*  to take a look at that episode.
*  And I'll just cue you all to a resource.
*  The hubermanlab.com website allows you,
*  thanks to our wonderful engineers,
*  to put in multiple topics.
*  So you could say shift work red light,
*  or shift work dopamine, or shift work sunlight,
*  and it will take you to the exact timestamps
*  across all the episodes where those specific topics occur.
*  It's all zero cost, as opposed to having to go
*  and peruse all these different episodes.
*  A lot of people have said, why not shorter episodes?
*  It's like, well, the idea was to create a library
*  of information that now AI and better engineering
*  of websites can allow you to just pull
*  the relevant information just like you would a book.
*  Well, I used to go to the library,
*  for those of you like me old enough to remember,
*  you actually took this thing called a book off a shelf,
*  you used Xerox, copied it.
*  In any event, it was very archaic and very expensive,
*  and you'd always get the margin of the book in the middle,
*  like the spine, it sucked.
*  Now you can go to the website and just get that information.
*  And then we also just launched an ai.hubermanlab.com website
*  again, it's all zero cost.
*  You can just say, hey, what should I do for shift work?
*  But I wanted to come here tonight,
*  so I didn't tell you that until you got here.
*  No, I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.
*  Okay, and there are a few other tools
*  about adjusting eating schedules and whatnot for shift work,
*  but hopefully that gets you going, Julia, thank you.
*  What's the difference between NSDR and meditation?
*  Thank you for this question.
*  I am a huge, huge, huge believer and proponent
*  and practitioner of NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
*  What is non-sleep deep rest?
*  Well, to be fair, yoga nidra, which translates to yoga sleep,
*  is a thousand year old practice,
*  thousands of year old practice in which you lie completely still,
*  keep the mind awake.
*  You're not thinking in a structured way,
*  it's more of a body scan, directed relaxation, et cetera.
*  I discovered this in 2015 when I was doing some research
*  for a book that I still can't manage to seem to finish
*  on trauma and addiction.
*  And I went, I have a friend, very talented trauma therapist
*  who's managed to help people with all sorts of addictions.
*  He'll be on the podcast in the not too distant future.
*  And I went down to this clinic in Florida
*  and everyone there spent the first hour of the day
*  doing yoga nidra.
*  This is pretty wacky.
*  I was still in my pure scientist,
*  quote unquote pure scientist, naive scientist lens.
*  And I thought, what is this about?
*  And he said, well, you know, so much of addiction
*  is about an inability to regulate impulses,
*  to deal with agitation, especially in the early days
*  of trying to get sober or being sober.
*  And it just helps people learn to self-direct
*  their nervous system in terms of self-directed relaxation.
*  It also seems to help with their sleep.
*  It also has these components about time and sort of,
*  because he said, you know, it's kind of interesting.
*  If you take a step back, you know,
*  if you can tolerate craving for a second, you just did it.
*  So why couldn't you do it for another second?
*  If I can do it for another second, another second.
*  It's not as if it necessarily increases linearly
*  or over time.
*  So, you know, what's going on?
*  And so again, sort of our ability to realize
*  and regulate our states across time and to realize
*  there's this funny thing where when we feel terrible,
*  we think it's gonna go on forever.
*  And when we're happy, we're like certain it's gonna stop.
*  There's like kind of asymmetry in our nervous system
*  that we don't understand.
*  We showed, he started talking about yoga nidra
*  really seems to help addicts recover and stay sober
*  if they do it regularly.
*  I thought, well, this is cool.
*  What is it?
*  I'm a neuroscientist.
*  We started studying it in my laboratory.
*  We discovered that the brain goes into these states
*  during yoga nidra that are similar to sleep.
*  Body still, mind alert.
*  And that seems to be very beneficial,
*  maybe even accelerates neuroplasticity and learning.
*  And indeed there's evidence for that.
*  And there's evidence that yoga nidra
*  from a laboratory out of Scandinavia,
*  not my laboratory showing that it can increase dopamine
*  levels in the striatum, basal ganglia by up to 60%
*  using human positron emission tomography imaging.
*  So we're talking about how to increase dopamine
*  through non-pharmacologic means.
*  This something about body still brain active,
*  very powerful way to do that.
*  I made up this term, this acronym non-sleep deep rest,
*  because I have tremendous respect for yoga nidra
*  and the yoga traditions, but I was concerned.
*  For a lot of people, unfortunately,
*  when they hear yoga nidra, it sounds esoteric
*  and they're not gonna approach that practice.
*  Also yoga nidra includes intentions
*  and some things that are a little bit on the mystical side.
*  I knew I was gonna take some heat for it
*  and I feel badly about it, but that bad feeling is offset
*  by I think when you call something non-sleep deep rest,
*  it tells you what it is.
*  And then more people are likely to come to the practice
*  and I felt like it was worth, you know,
*  kind of putting myself, you know,
*  jumping on the grenade for that one.
*  So non-sleep deep rest is very effective
*  at restoring cognitive and physical vigor
*  and can indeed offset some degree of sleep loss.
*  It also gets you better at falling and staying asleep
*  and it's very simple and very easy to do and it's zero cost
*  and if you wanna try it, you can go onto YouTube
*  and put NSDR in my last name.
*  There's a woman named Kelly Boyes, B-O-Y-S,
*  who has a much more pleasant voice than mine,
*  who does them as well.
*  These are all zero cost protocols.
*  She's also in the Waking Up app
*  and there are many of them.
*  Kamini Desai is another person who has, you know,
*  wonderful yoga nidra scripts.
*  So you can find these things and they're really about
*  10 minutes to 20 minutes, sometimes 30 minutes long.
*  You can do it for an hour,
*  but most people won't do that consistently.
*  You don't have to do them every day
*  and they're very, very effective at restoring mental
*  and physical vigor when you're feeling depleted
*  and getting you to be a better sleeper.
*  So I figure that's a zero cost tool
*  that is grounded in good mechanistic science
*  and makes sense logically, so why not?
*  Meditation, typically, and there are many different forms
*  of meditation, but if you're, let's just say,
*  kind of standard, if there were such a thing,
*  third eye meditation, closing your eyes,
*  focusing your concentration on a point
*  just sort of at your forehead,
*  concentrating on your breathing,
*  redirecting your attention to your breathing
*  if your attention drifts.
*  We know based on work from Wendy Suzuki's laboratory
*  at New York University and some work out
*  at the University of Wisconsin can improve memory,
*  can improve focus, and does seem to have some
*  stress offsetting effects, but it's more of a
*  focus exercise as opposed to an energy replenishing exercise.
*  Now some people meditate and feel better afterwards,
*  they have more energy, but then it's sort of like,
*  well, compared to what?
*  I don't think that's the major effect of meditation.
*  And while we're on these topics, I should just say
*  that self-directed hypnosis of the sort
*  that my colleague David Spiegel studies
*  is more about solving a particular problem.
*  So hypnosis is more about engaging neuroplasticity.
*  Remember earlier we said that neuroplasticity in adulthood
*  can be activated by focus followed by rest?
*  It seems that in these self-directed hypnotic states,
*  the brain enters kind of pattern of activity
*  in which neuroplasticity can be accessed more quickly,
*  we think, because the brain is both focused and relaxed
*  in a particular way, merging that focus and rest state.
*  And of course, the hypnotic script is not about getting you
*  to do crazy things on stage, that's stage hypnosis,
*  but self-directed hypnosis is, for instance,
*  smoking cessation.
*  By the way, the success with smoking cessation
*  from hypnosis is far greater than the cessation
*  with smoking from pretty much any other protocol.
*  But unfortunately, it has the name hypnosis,
*  which makes people think about the stuff
*  that people do on stage that's kind of wacky.
*  So we need a new name for it,
*  because unfortunately names are a problem.
*  Their names can be differentiators
*  as opposed to integrators.
*  They don't bring, when people say,
*  I'm gonna hypnotize you, or you should try hypnosis,
*  people are like, eh, like yum, yuck, man, they're like yuck.
*  So by the way, does everyone here remember
*  how you know if you're highly hypnotizable?
*  Do you know that the Spiegel Eye Roll Test,
*  it's not what teenagers do, David Spiegel and his father,
*  psychiatrist, discovered the clinical application
*  of hypnosis, it's a clinically approved tool.
*  There's brainstem neurons that cause elevations
*  and alertness and focus, and they're associated
*  with moving the eyes up.
*  There are brainstem neurons that close the eyelids
*  and push, and essentially drive the eyes down,
*  that are associated with parasympathetic states,
*  which is why you go like this when you're tired
*  and you're out there, I'm sure.
*  If you are capable of keeping your gaze upward
*  and closing your eyelids, you score,
*  on a particular end of the so-called Spiegel Eye Roll Test,
*  which makes you highly hypnotizable,
*  because that state of hypnosis is one in which you're,
*  what, alert, but very, very relaxed.
*  So if you go to Spiegel's laboratory,
*  they're gonna look at you and they say,
*  look up at the ceiling, and then close your eyelids,
*  and if you can still see the whites of,
*  if they still see the whites of your eyes
*  as your eyelids close, well then you're
*  in the highly hypnotizable realm.
*  Kind of interesting, right?
*  There's all nervous system related,
*  and you can see this stuff is,
*  this is like real clinical tools.
*  Okay, how do we stop ourselves
*  from mindlessly scrolling on our phones?
*  Hard questions.
*  I didn't look at my watch, because I'm bored.
*  I'm just thinking, how much time do you have?
*  Well, on the way here to Australia,
*  Rob, who you met earlier, my friend and podcast producer,
*  he said, okay guys, everyone's deleting social media
*  from your phones for the whole trip, the whole trip.
*  And I'm like, I don't know if I can go on this trip,
*  Rob, no, I'm kidding.
*  We have one guy who's kept it on his phone
*  so that we can post things, and we continue to.
*  Honestly, I think that's what it takes.
*  If it's social media that you're scrolling,
*  I think you should do a delete and reinstall.
*  If I'm honest, a delete and reinstall every day.
*  Because I think, and then you have
*  to limit the amount of time.
*  And one of the members of my podcast team experienced this.
*  He said, I just picked up my phone a minute ago,
*  and I went to hit the Instagram tab,
*  and it wasn't there, and I know it's not there.
*  And that's where I say, yeah, at some point,
*  it becomes more compulsive than addiction.
*  These are just reflexive behaviors.
*  It's like walking into the refrigerator.
*  I could do it every day of my life, all day.
*  I walk into people's homes and just look in the refrigerator.
*  I don't even know, I get into people's cars,
*  I look in the glove box.
*  I just do this, I'm kinda like looking around,
*  I'm not gonna steal anything.
*  But it's like the teenage boy in me.
*  I just kinda like walk in, I'm gonna open your refrigerator.
*  So I think it gets to the point of reflexive,
*  and it's compulsive, and it might be addictive,
*  but it can't be good when it's like that.
*  But I think social media can be really useful.
*  So I think you can set timers,
*  you can try graying out the screen,
*  getting rid of the color thing.
*  There's all this stuff, but I think if there are particular
*  apps that you're struggling with,
*  I would just delete them from your phone and do a reinstall,
*  because that's enough of a behavioral barrier.
*  There are enough steps involved, enough sequencing
*  to put the thing back on there each day and each time,
*  maybe twice a day, that you're going to vastly
*  reduce your use.
*  To be honest, I think that's probably the best way to do it.
*  And there are probably people in this audience
*  that are thinking, this seems crazy.
*  Like just don't turn it on, just don't open it.
*  And look, if I was 65 years old, I'd say that too.
*  But it doesn't work that way
*  for certainly the younger generation.
*  It doesn't.
*  And I know this because I gave a talk
*  at Santa Clara University a few years ago,
*  and I was talking about limiting social media use and phones.
*  And this kid came up to me afterwards,
*  he said, you don't get it.
*  He's like, you're like, back then I was like 43.
*  He said, you don't get it.
*  He said, for you, the phone was a thing
*  that you like integrated into your like post 90s
*  high school life.
*  Like you watched The Breakfast Club,
*  or I don't know how he knew that movie.
*  I was like, you're right, I did watch The Breakfast Club
*  a bunch of times.
*  And he said, but for us, it's like life.
*  I rolled my eyes and I thought, wait, no, listen,
*  I'm gonna listen, because no one knows what it's like
*  to be 16 years old or 24 years old in 2024,
*  unless you're 16 or 24.
*  I'm like, okay, here we go.
*  Listen, he said, when my phone powers down,
*  I feel the energy drain out of me.
*  And when it comes back up, I feel life energy come back.
*  It's like energy come back into my body.
*  And I thought, oh my goodness, like we are hosed.
*  But that's the reality.
*  And I'm of the mind, I was a camp counselor,
*  I worked with at risk kids, I was a wild kid,
*  and you learn something, especially when you work
*  with kids like me.
*  When I was a teenager, I was a hellion.
*  Be a channel, not a dam.
*  You cannot block this system that's emerged.
*  This is here and it's here to stay.
*  Deleting the app, putting it back on there
*  is the only way to go.
*  We have to listen, I think we have to listen
*  and understand that, after all, adults created
*  these technologies and these kids are using them
*  and I don't think we're gonna see a reversal.
*  I don't.
*  So we have to really, I think what he said to me,
*  as scary as it was to me, I think reflects the reality.
*  It's part of their life energy,
*  it's part of their connectivity,
*  and we're gonna have to come up with better tools.
*  And I doubt those tools are going to be
*  to the effect of eliminating it.
*  You could say, unfortunately, you know all the adults,
*  last I checked I'm an adult,
*  people in my life have argued differently,
*  but I think we're gonna have to learn to be a channel,
*  not a dam with this.
*  I do.
*  If resources and ethics were not an issue,
*  what would your dream clinical trial to run?
*  Oh my goodness.
*  This is a hard question.
*  Okay.
*  Dream clinical trial.
*  What's that?
*  Oh gosh, the action is killing me.
*  More cuttlefish, yeah, more cuttlefish.
*  Like, cuttlefish, I like the idea of more cuddling.
*  Physical contact, so key.
*  I think we're all still recovering from the years,
*  we had a few years ago,
*  I think we're all still recovering from the years,
*  we had a few years of just like no physical,
*  like physical contact, so minimal.
*  I mean, there's the classic Harlow experiments, right?
*  The wire monkey versus the cloth monkey.
*  I mean, primates go to the cloth monkey
*  even if they don't get food there.
*  I mean, it's such a critical component
*  of how our nervous system forms.
*  I think this is a, you know what?
*  I'm gonna do something I've never done before.
*  I'm gonna turn the question around.
*  I actually would, seriously,
*  I'm not trying to avoid answering this,
*  but we've worked on, also I've worked on cuttlefish,
*  we've worked on respiration practices,
*  we've worked on vision,
*  we've worked on neuro regeneration.
*  You know, I've enjoyed working on a great number
*  of different things.
*  I'm sort of curious what people,
*  what do you think we need more of?
*  I've never done this, but I really wanna know.
*  I don't know how we're gonna do this
*  in any kind of non-chaotic format,
*  but what the hell?
*  It's late enough in the evening, we'll just do it.
*  Like, really, I mean, so now there's trials on psychedelics.
*  Maybe we do this by kind of, like,
*  I'll throw out some options and then we'll do it.
*  So right now it seems that psychedelics are a big thing.
*  Do they increase plasticity?
*  Yeah, I'm excited about it.
*  I'm a convert, but I do think that one has to be careful
*  and there are certain people in populations,
*  like people who suffer from certain types of manic bipolar
*  or schizophrenia that really need to avoid these things,
*  I mean, being a kid is basically being
*  in a psychedelic state.
*  Lateral connectivity of the brain is extensive
*  and I don't encourage it.
*  I mean, the trials with MDMA and PTSD are incredible.
*  What's happening with MAPS is incredible.
*  60 plus percent remission rates,
*  done with licensed physicians, of course.
*  I don't get cavalier with this.
*  So, okay, so I'll just ask, so, I mean,
*  it's gonna be hard to draw out the dissenters,
*  but more work on psychedelics, psilocybin, et cetera,
*  as ways to ameliorate depression.
*  Are people more like yum, yuck, or meh?
*  Is it like yum?
*  Okay, or like yuck?
*  Don't be afraid to say yuck.
*  I like a good argument.
*  Is anyone like yuck on psychedelics?
*  Sorcery, it's sorcery, I heard that.
*  Meh, okay, all right, interesting.
*  Okay, so psychedelics get a strong push.
*  I think we have enough evidence
*  that changing patterns of respiration changes brain states,
*  but I think that that's an interesting area.
*  I don't know, can you just shout it out?
*  Just shout it out.
*  All right, first over here, yes?
*  God, the accent, you guys are so good.
*  I love the accent.
*  Listen, I don't drink anymore,
*  but when I used to go to bars,
*  I'll just say the Australian accent never fails.
*  In the US, yeah?
*  Time chambers, time chambers.
*  Oh, hyperbaric chambers.
*  Yeah, hyperbaric, that's an interesting one.
*  Yeah, I mean, when I think of ways to modify physiology,
*  you think temperature, light, neuromodulators, right?
*  You think, by the way, anytime you wanna think
*  about changing something in the body or brain,
*  you think mechanical and chemical.
*  So this is kind of, this is changing the chemistry
*  of the brain and body through hyperbaric chambers.
*  Thank you, appreciate it.
*  I think I reckon, did we run into each other
*  at the gym the other day?
*  No, anyway, I think I recognize you.
*  Okay, I'll get to you in one second, yeah?
*  Yeah, love that.
*  Okay, so protocols for childhood trauma, yeah.
*  So I mean, I think we're finally at the place
*  where we, as a world where this word trauma
*  actually is meaningful, because we knew it before,
*  but I think before people thought of if you hadn't lived
*  in a war zone, which obviously is trauma.
*  Now I think people appreciate that trauma
*  is inherent to a lot of life.
*  By the way, I love your shirt, I own that shirt.
*  It's like, yeah, as a Lonsdale shirt, it's against racism.
*  Hey, I love that shirt.
*  You know the history of that shirt, right?
*  It's like Lonsdale was co-opted by some neo-Nazi groups
*  as a brand, so Lonsdale came out with an
*  Against Racism and Hate shirt, which is like the best,
*  like, to that, which is, yeah, so anyway,
*  a little side note there, not sponsored by Lonsdale.
*  But rad shirt.
*  Yeah, I think childhood trauma, you know,
*  trauma can be best defined as an adverse event
*  that changes the nervous system in a way
*  that causes maladaptive functioning going forward.
*  It's not every bad thing, right?
*  But it certainly happens, and I think we need to learn
*  to rewire the nervous system.
*  Let's face it, whether or not psychedelics
*  or it's talk therapy or it's hyperbaric chambers
*  or it's cold plunges, what we're talking about
*  is neuroplasticity, we're trying to rewire
*  the nervous system, so I love that one.
*  We need some very structured tools.
*  There's all sorts of stuff about psoas release for trauma.
*  And you know, there's little bits,
*  like little silos of things that are all very interesting.
*  Breath work, you know, release work,
*  but so far there isn't like a structured framework
*  for treating trauma.
*  Different groups doing different things, EMDR, et cetera.
*  I think they all have merit.
*  Okay, there was the, shouting out.
*  Consciousness.
*  Consciousness, the big C, yeah.
*  In my house Costello was the big C.
*  He would always remind me of that.
*  But consciousness, I think that,
*  and now with AI, we have to ask ourselves,
*  like what is consciousness?
*  And I think we need a clear definition of what that is.
*  Do you guys know this story of like,
*  they were gonna solve consciousness a few years ago,
*  and they didn't do it.
*  There was this bet in neuroscience
*  that it was gonna be solved by 2015 or something like that.
*  So I think we need, and it's not obviously,
*  so we need better definition of what that means.
*  But I think it's a very important problem, indeed.
*  So thank you.
*  Maybe a.
*  Free will, yeah, that's a tough one.
*  That's one I usually avoid.
*  Robert slammed me on that one on the podcast.
*  What was it in the back?
*  I heard as an adaptive technique, but.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You know, we hear, yeah, we hear so much,
*  I'm agreeing with you.
*  We hear so much about ADHD these days
*  without an understanding of like,
*  what it really reflects,
*  except in the extreme clinical cases.
*  So I think a better understanding.
*  I did two episodes of the podcast, by the way,
*  on attention and ADHD.
*  One focused mainly on behavioral and nutritional tools.
*  It was positively received by about half of people,
*  and then the other half were like, this is garbage.
*  What about all the drugs that are useful?
*  Then I did one about all the drugs that can be useful.
*  People said, this is garbage.
*  You're putting kids on meth.
*  And I'm like, wait a second, hold on.
*  We try and cover it all.
*  So, because I favor balance,
*  I heard excellent things.
*  There was, we're all male voices.
*  We kind of got a sampling bias here,
*  unless I've got a high frequency cutoff.
*  Thank you.
*  Something negotiation, sorry.
*  Science of negotiation.
*  Yeah, so people being able to resolve differences better.
*  Lord, please, yes.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  I mean, this is, yes, thank you.
*  If ever there was a call to action,
*  it's like, you know, this is a big question, right?
*  I'm a neuroscientist, not a historian,
*  not a futurist or a politician, but thank goodness.
*  Imagine what a terrible job I would do.
*  I like being outdoors.
*  I hate meetings.
*  I like dressing like this, and I don't like the news.
*  It'd be the worst.
*  But yeah, if ever there was a need and a question,
*  are we just gonna continue in these iterative cycles
*  of when the economy is good, things seem mostly good,
*  and then a lot of people are still suffering,
*  and then these cycles of,
*  or are we going to finally just sit back and go,
*  okay, what are we good at as a species?
*  What are we really bad at?
*  What are we kind of good at?
*  And start coming up with some tools
*  to try and function better on the whole,
*  with the understanding that there are bad actors out there
*  that are constantly trying to exploit and manipulate,
*  but there are also a lot of good actors too,
*  and by good actors, I don't mean actors
*  in the stage acting sense.
*  I think that, look, we're a smart species.
*  We can think in past, present, and future terms.
*  We can look at mechanism.
*  We can communicate better with each other
*  better than any species, except maybe the cuttlefish.
*  And so I think the question is,
*  is there gonna be some sort of sitting back
*  and finally just saying enough?
*  Let's just figure out a way to dialogue,
*  and I love that.
*  It's science-wise that there are problems
*  and there are hard problems,
*  and honestly, I think it's gonna come about,
*  if it comes about, it's gonna come about through groups,
*  not through individuals.
*  I don't think we're gonna get the world leader
*  or world leaders of 12 people like, let's get it done.
*  Let's get it done right this time.
*  I think it's gonna be a more collective consciousness.
*  I'd like to see fewer individual leaders
*  and more groups and panels leading things,
*  but anyway, that's my bias.
*  Genetics?
*  Genetics?
*  Genetics.
*  Love it.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay, well, I'll say two things,
*  and then I think my team's gonna make me close out.
*  Wait.
*  Rad, okay, awesome.
*  Now it's turning into like a science punk rock show.
*  So the genetics, well, I think the big thing is
*  in genetics, we're soon gonna be in the place
*  where we can do genetic, well, right now,
*  you can take human embryos and screen them for mutations
*  by whole genome sequencing.
*  It's very inexpensive compared to a few years ago.
*  It's still expensive, and you can do selection.
*  You can select out based on lack of mutations,
*  maybe even based on over-representation of certain genes.
*  That's interesting, has some ethical considerations,
*  but soon we'll be, you can do CRISPR.
*  You could, in theory, you could modify the genome
*  of adults and certainly babies,
*  and so that's where we're headed.
*  It's already being done in certain countries.
*  It was done in China.
*  It was not looked upon kindly
*  by the international ethics committees,
*  but it was done, a mutation in the HIV receptor.
*  So those babies exist.
*  So it's happening.
*  It's gonna be interesting times.
*  The microbiome, I think, is really exciting.
*  Here's my big call to action is that there's a microbiome
*  in the gut, but there's also a microbiome on the skin
*  and the nose and the mouth and the genitals,
*  like all these little niches, and well, I guess it depends,
*  the little or not so little niches, depends.
*  I was thinking about the nostrils.
*  The night's getting long.
*  There I go again.
*  They are all important, and there's a lot more
*  to understand.
*  I think the gut microbiome is just one of the microbiomes.
*  And female hormones, certainly important topic.
*  It's received, sadly, far less attention
*  than male hormone therapy or understanding,
*  and things are starting to change there.
*  It's been slow.
*  Can you believe it?
*  It was only eight years ago
*  that the National Institutes of Health in the United States
*  was like, hey, maybe you should start
*  studying female mice, too.
*  Like, I mean, modern science is very far behind.
*  We're very far behind, and I think it's a resource issue.
*  It's also, there's a bunch of sociological considerations
*  in science.
*  Anyway, I'm trying to change the story there,
*  but I'm but one person, and I hope to live a very long time,
*  but should I get hit by a bullet, a bus, or cancer tomorrow,
*  I want you to know that it's gonna be,
*  or long time from now, natural causes.
*  Sorry, I have a morbid sense of humor.
*  I worked with the physicians.
*  They all talk like that.
*  I hope to live a very long time,
*  but it's a collective effort.
*  So I just wanna, before we wrap,
*  I wanna say a couple of things
*  we can get on with the rest of the night.
*  First of all, it is a collective effort.
*  As I've mentioned several times this evening,
*  I look no differently on the massage therapy
*  versus chiropractic versus whole genome sequencing.
*  It's just all different lenses to look at
*  the same sort of set of goals through,
*  and yes, there's a range of quality and rigor
*  and communication styles and personalities,
*  but if you can maintain some level of curiosity
*  and discernment about what works for you
*  or doesn't work for you or where you think there's merit,
*  that's great, but it's gonna be
*  a wonderful thing when we can all start to dialogue
*  and see where the points of convergence are,
*  where you're basically talking about two different groups
*  talking about the exact same thing
*  through a different language.
*  I think that's where things really can move forward.
*  The discourse of public science and health communication
*  obviously is something I'm very passionate about.
*  I would love to see more podcasts, believe it or not.
*  Not just my podcast, but there are more podcasts.
*  If you have something to say to the world, please say it.
*  Please put it out there on social media.
*  I do think that there's value there,
*  so I'm encouraging every person,
*  not just usually the young people,
*  but every people to get information out there
*  and to support the efforts,
*  and I also wanna say thank you so much
*  for coming out on a Saturday night here in Melbourne
*  and for listening to the podcast,
*  and for, yeah, it really means a lot to me.
*  Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you,
*  thank you so much.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  I really appreciate it that the podcast
*  is indeed a labor of love.
*  I feel oh so blessed to do it,
*  and my hope is that the tools, protocols, and information
*  will radiate out as far and wide as possible.
*  I don't need or want credit.
*  I just want people to have the information.
*  I really mean that, and to share it
*  where you think it can be useful to people,
*  and last but certainly not least,
*  thank you for your interest in science.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you so much.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
