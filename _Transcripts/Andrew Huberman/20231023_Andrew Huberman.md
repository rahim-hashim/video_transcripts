# Mark Zuckerberg & Dr. Priscilla Chan: Curing All Human Diseases & the Future of Health & Technology
**Andrew Huberman:** [October 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Wo6SqLNmLk)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
*  where we discuss science
*  and science-based tools for everyday life.
*  I'm Andrew Huberman,
*  and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
*  at Stanford School of Medicine.
*  My guests today are Mark Zuckerberg and Dr. Priscilla Chan.
*  Mark Zuckerberg, as everybody knows,
*  founded the company Facebook.
*  He is now the CEO of Metta,
*  which includes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp,
*  and other technology platforms.
*  Dr. Priscilla Chan graduated from Harvard
*  and went on to do her medical degree
*  at the University of California, San Francisco.
*  Mark Zuckerberg and Dr. Priscilla Chan are married
*  and the co-founders of the CZI,
*  or Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,
*  a philanthropic organization
*  whose stated goal is to cure all human diseases.
*  The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is accomplishing that
*  by providing critical funding not available elsewhere,
*  as well as a novel framework for discovery
*  of the basic functioning of cells,
*  cataloging all the different human cell types,
*  as well as providing AI,
*  or artificial intelligence platforms,
*  to mine all of that data to discover new pathways
*  and cures for all human diseases.
*  The first hour of today's discussion
*  is held with both Dr. Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg,
*  during which we discuss the CZI
*  and what it really means to try and cure all human diseases.
*  We talk about the motivational backbone for the CZI
*  that extends well into each of their personal histories.
*  Indeed, you'll learn quite a lot
*  about Dr. Priscilla Chan, who has, I must say,
*  an absolutely incredible family story
*  leading up to her role as a physician
*  and her motivations for the CZI and beyond.
*  And you'll learn from Mark
*  how he's bringing an engineering and AI perspective
*  to discovery of new cures for human disease.
*  The second half of today's discussion
*  is just between Mark Zuckerberg and me,
*  during which we discuss various meta-platforms,
*  including, of course, social media platforms
*  and their effects on mental health in children and adults.
*  We also discuss VR, virtual reality,
*  as well as augmented and mixed reality.
*  And we discuss AI, artificial intelligence,
*  and how it stands to transform
*  not just our online experiences
*  with social media and other technologies,
*  but how it stands to potentially transform
*  every aspect of everyday life.
*  Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
*  is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
*  It is, however, part of my desire and effort
*  to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
*  and science related tools to the general public.
*  In keeping with that theme,
*  I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
*  Our first sponsor is 8Sleep.
*  8Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling,
*  heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
*  I've spoken many times before on this podcast
*  about the fact that getting a great night's sleep
*  really is the foundation of mental health,
*  physical health, and performance.
*  One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
*  is to make sure that the temperature
*  of your sleeping environment is correct.
*  And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
*  your body temperature actually has to drop
*  by about one to three degrees.
*  And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
*  your body temperature actually has to increase
*  by about one to three degrees.
*  With 8Sleep, you can program the temperature
*  of your sleeping environment in the beginning,
*  middle, and end of your night.
*  It has a number of other features,
*  like tracking the amount of rapid eye movement
*  and slow wave sleep that you get,
*  things that are essential to really dialing in
*  the perfect night's sleep for you.
*  I've been sleeping on an 8Sleep mattress cover
*  for well over two years now,
*  and it has greatly improved my sleep.
*  I fall asleep far more quickly.
*  I wake up far less often in the middle of the night,
*  and I wake up feeling far more refreshed
*  than I ever did prior to using an 8Sleep mattress cover.
*  If you'd like to try 8Sleep,
*  you can go to 8sleep.com slash Huberman
*  to save $150 off their Pod 3 cover.
*  8Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, UK,
*  select countries in the EU and Australia.
*  Again, that's 8sleep.com slash Huberman.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
*  Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need
*  and nothing you don't.
*  That means plenty of electrolytes,
*  sodium, magnesium, and potassium, and no sugar.
*  The electrolytes are absolutely essential
*  for the functioning of every cell in your body,
*  and your neurons, your nerve cells,
*  rely on sodium, magnesium, and potassium
*  in order to communicate with one another
*  electrically and chemically.
*  Element contains the optimal ratio of electrolytes
*  for the functioning of neurons
*  and the other cells of your body.
*  Every morning, I drink a packet of Element
*  dissolved in about 32 ounces of water.
*  I do that just for general hydration
*  and to make sure that I have adequate electrolytes
*  for any activities that day.
*  I'll often also have an Element packet,
*  or even two packets, in 32 to 60 ounces of water
*  if I'm exercising very hard,
*  and certainly if I'm sweating a lot
*  in order to make sure that I replace those electrolytes.
*  If you'd like to try Element,
*  you can go to drinklmnt.com slash Huberman
*  to get a free sample pack with your purchase.
*  Again, that's drinklmnt.com slash Huberman.
*  I'm pleased to announce that we will be hosting
*  four live events in Australia,
*  each of which is entitled The Brain-Body Contract,
*  during which I will share science and science-related tools
*  for mental health, physical health, and performance.
*  There will also be a live question and answer session.
*  We have limited tickets still available
*  for the event in Melbourne on February 10th,
*  as well as the event in Brisbane on February 24th.
*  Our event in Sydney at the Sydney Opera House
*  sold out very quickly, so as a consequence,
*  we've now scheduled a second event in Sydney
*  at the Aware Super Theater on February 18th.
*  To access tickets to any of these events,
*  you can go to hubermanlab.com slash events
*  and use the code Huberman at checkout.
*  I hope to see you there, and as always,
*  thank you for your interest in science.
*  And now for my discussion with Mark Zuckerberg
*  and Dr. Priscilla Chan.
*  Priscilla and Mark, so great to meet you,
*  and thank you for having me here in your home.
*  Oh, thanks for having us on the podcast.
*  Yeah.
*  I'd like to talk about the CZI,
*  the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
*  I learned about this a few years ago
*  when my lab was, and still is now, at Stanford
*  as a very exciting philanthropic effort
*  that has a truly big mission.
*  I can't imagine a bigger mission.
*  So maybe you could tell us what that big mission is,
*  and then we can get into some of the mechanics
*  of how that big mission can become a reality.
*  So like you're mentioning, in 2015,
*  we launched the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,
*  and what we were hoping to do at CZI
*  was think about how do we build a better future for everyone,
*  and looking for ways where we can contribute
*  the resources that we have to bring philanthropically,
*  and the experiences that Mark and I have had,
*  for me as a physician and educator,
*  for Mark as an engineer,
*  and then our ability to bring teams together to build builders.
*  Mark has been a builder throughout his career,
*  and what could we do if we actually put together
*  a team to build tools, do great science?
*  And so within our science portfolio,
*  we've really been focused on what some people think
*  is either an incredibly audacious goal,
*  or an inevitable goal,
*  but I think about it as something that will happen
*  if we sort of continue focusing on it,
*  which is to be able to cure, prevent, or manage
*  all disease by the end of the century.
*  All disease. All disease.
*  So that's important, right?
*  A lot of times people ask, like, which disease?
*  The whole point is that there is not one disease,
*  and it's really about taking a step back
*  to where I always found the most hope as a physician,
*  which is new discoveries and new opportunities
*  and new ways of understanding how to keep people well
*  come from basic science.
*  So our strategy at CZI is really to build tools,
*  fund science, change the way basic scientists
*  can see the world and how they can move quickly
*  in their discoveries.
*  And so that's what we launched in 2015.
*  We do work in three ways.
*  We fund great scientists.
*  We build tools, right now software tools,
*  to help move science along and make it easier
*  for scientists to do their work.
*  And we do science.
*  You mentioned Stanford being an important pillar
*  for our science work.
*  We've built what we call bio hubs, institutes
*  where teams can take on grand challenges
*  to do work that wouldn't be possible in a single lab
*  or within a single discipline.
*  And our first bio hub was launched in San Francisco,
*  collaboration between Stanford, UC Berkeley, and UCSF.
*  Amazing.
*  Curing all diseases implies that there will either be
*  a ton of knowledge gleaned from this effort,
*  which I'm certain there will be, and there already has been.
*  We can talk about some of those early successes in a moment.
*  But it also sort of implies that if we can understand
*  some basic operations of diseases and cells
*  that transcend autism, Huntington's, Parkinson's, cancer,
*  and any other disease that perhaps there are
*  some core principles that would make the big mission
*  a real reality, so to speak.
*  What I'm basically saying is, how are you attacking this?
*  My belief is that the cell sits at the center
*  of all discussion about disease,
*  given that our body is made up of cells
*  and different types of cells.
*  So maybe you could just illuminate for us a little bit
*  of what the cell is in your mind as it relates to disease
*  and how one goes about understanding disease
*  in the context of cells, because ultimately,
*  that's what we're made up of.
*  Yeah, well, let's get to the cell thing in a moment,
*  but just even taking a step back from that,
*  we don't think that it's CZI that we're going to cure,
*  prevent, or manage all diseases.
*  The goal is to basically give the scientific community
*  and scientists around the world the tools
*  to accelerate the pace of science.
*  And we spent a lot of time when we were getting started
*  with this, looking at the history of science
*  and trying to understand the trends
*  and how they've played out over time.
*  And if you look over this very long-term arc,
*  most large-scale discoveries are preceded
*  by the invention of a new tool or a new way to see something.
*  And it's not just in biology, right?
*  It's like having a telescope came before a lot
*  of discoveries in astronomy and astrophysics,
*  but similarly, the microscope
*  and just different ways to observe things
*  or different platforms, like the ability to do vaccines
*  preceded the ability to kind of cure
*  a lot of different things.
*  So this is sort of the engineering part
*  that you were talking about, about building tools.
*  We view our goal is to try to bring together
*  some scientific and engineering knowledge
*  to build tools that empower the whole field.
*  And that's sort of the big arc.
*  And a lot of the things that we're focused on,
*  including the work in single cell and cell understanding,
*  which you can jump in and get into that if you want.
*  But yeah, I think we generally agree
*  with the premise that if you wanna understand this stuff
*  from first principles, people study organs a lot, right?
*  They study kind of how things present across the body,
*  but there's not a very widespread understanding
*  of how kind of each cell operates.
*  And this is sort of a big part of some of the initial work
*  that we tried to do on the human cell atlas
*  and understanding what are the different cells.
*  And there's a bunch more work that we wanna do
*  to carry that forward.
*  But overall, I think when we think about the next 10 years
*  here of this long arc to try to empower the community
*  to be able to cure, prevent, or manage all diseases,
*  we think that the next 10 years should really be primarily
*  about being able to measure and observe more things
*  in human biology.
*  There are a lot of limits to that.
*  It's like you wanna look at something through a microscope.
*  You can't usually see living tissues
*  because it's hard to see through skin or things like that.
*  So there are a lot of different techniques
*  that will help us observe different things.
*  And this is sort of where the engineering background
*  comes in a bit because when I think about this
*  is from the perspective of how you'd write code or something,
*  the idea of trying to debug or fix a code base,
*  but not be able to step through the code line by line,
*  it's not gonna happen.
*  And at the beginning of any big project that we do at Meta,
*  we like to spend a bunch of the time up front
*  just trying to instrument things and understand
*  what are we gonna look at
*  and how are we gonna measure things before,
*  so we know we're making progress and know what to optimize.
*  And this is such a long-term journey that,
*  and we think that it actually makes sense
*  to take the next 10 years to build those kind of tools
*  for biology and understanding
*  just how the human body works in action,
*  and a big part of that is cells.
*  I don't know, do you wanna jump in
*  and talk about some of the efforts?
*  Could I just interrupt briefly
*  and just ask about the different interventions,
*  so to speak, that CZI is in a unique position
*  to bring to the quest to cure all diseases.
*  So I can think of, I mean, I know as a scientist
*  that money is necessary but not sufficient, right?
*  Like when you have money, you can hire more people,
*  you can try different things, so that's critical,
*  but a lot of philanthropy includes money.
*  The other component is, you wanna be able to see things,
*  as you pointed out, so you wanna know
*  the normal disease process, like what is a healthy cell,
*  what's a diseased cell?
*  Are the cells constantly being bombarded with challenges
*  and then repairing those, and then what we call cancer
*  is just kind of the runaway train of those challenges
*  not being met by the cell itself or something like that.
*  So better imaging tools, and then it sounds like
*  there's not just a hardware component
*  but a software component.
*  This is where AI comes in.
*  So maybe we can, at some point, we can break this up
*  into three different avenues.
*  One is understanding disease processes
*  and healthy processes, we'll lump those together.
*  Then there's hardware, so microscopes, lenses,
*  digital deconvolution, ways of seeing things
*  in bolder relief and more precision.
*  And then there's how to manage all the data.
*  And then I love the idea that maybe AI could do
*  what human brains can't do alone,
*  manage understanding of the data.
*  Because it's one thing to organize data,
*  it's another to say, oh, you know,
*  as you point out in the analogy with code,
*  this particular gene and that particular gene
*  are potentially interesting, whereas a human being
*  would never make that potential connection.
*  So the tools that CZI can bring to the table,
*  we fund science, like you're talking about.
*  And we try to, there's lots of ways to fund science.
*  And just to be clear, what we fund
*  is a tiny fraction of what the NIH funds, for instance.
*  So we-
*  You guys have been generous enough that it's,
*  it definitely holds weight to NIH, NIH's contribution.
*  Yeah, but I think every funder has its own role
*  in the ecosystem.
*  And for us, it's really,
*  how do we incentivize new points of view?
*  How do we incentivize collaboration?
*  How do we incentivize open science?
*  And so a lot of our grants include inviting people
*  to look at different fields.
*  Our first neuroscience RFA was aimed towards incentivizing
*  people from different backgrounds,
*  immunologists, microbiologists,
*  to come and look at how our nervous system works
*  and how to keep it healthy.
*  Or we ask that our grantees participate
*  in the preprint movement to accelerate the rate
*  of sharing knowledge and actually others being able
*  to build upon science.
*  So that's the funding that we do.
*  In terms of building, we build software and hardware,
*  like you mentioned.
*  We put together teams that can build tools
*  that are more durable and scalable
*  than someone in a single lab might be incentivized to do.
*  There's a ton of great ideas.
*  And nowadays, most scientists can tinker
*  and build something useful for their lab.
*  But it's really hard for them to be able to share
*  that tool sometimes beyond their own laptop
*  or forget the next lab over or across the globe.
*  So we partner with scientists to see what is useful,
*  what kinds of tools.
*  In imaging, NAPARI, it's a useful image annotation tool
*  that is born from an open source community.
*  And how can we contribute to that?
*  Or a cell by gene, which works on single cell data sets.
*  And how can we make it build a useful tool
*  so that scientists can share data sets, analyze their own
*  and contribute to a larger corpus of information.
*  So we have software teams that are building,
*  collaborating with scientists to make sure
*  that we're building easy to use, durable, translatable tools
*  across the scientific community in the areas that we work in.
*  We also have institutes.
*  This is where the imaging work comes in,
*  where we are proud owners of electronic microscope right now.
*  It's gonna be installed at our imaging institute
*  and that will really contribute to a way
*  where we can see work differently.
*  But more hardware does need to be developed.
*  We're partnering with a fantastic scientists
*  in the Biohub network to build a mini phase plate
*  to increase, to align the electrons through these,
*  through the electron microscope
*  to be able to increase the resolution
*  so we can see in sharper detail.
*  So there's a lot of innovative work
*  within the network that's happening.
*  And these institutes have grand challenges
*  that they're working on.
*  Back to your question about cells.
*  Cells are just the smallest unit that are alive.
*  And are your body, all of our bodies
*  have many, many, many cells.
*  There's some estimate of like 37 trillion cells,
*  different cells in your body.
*  And what are they all doing?
*  And what do they look like when you're healthy?
*  What do they look like when you're sick?
*  And where we're at right now with our understanding of cells
*  and what happens when you get sick
*  is basically we've gotten pretty good
*  from the Human Genome Project
*  looking at how different mutations in your genetic code
*  lead for you to be more susceptible to get sick
*  or directly cause you to get sick.
*  So we go from a mutation in your DNA
*  to wow, you now have Huntington's disease, for instance.
*  And there's a lot that happens in the middle.
*  And that's one of the questions that we're going after
*  at CZI is what actually happens?
*  So an analogy that I like to use to share with my friends
*  is right now, say we have a recipe for a cake.
*  We know there's a typo in the recipe.
*  And then the cake is awful.
*  That's all we know.
*  We don't know how the chef interprets the typo.
*  We don't know what happens in the oven.
*  And we don't actually know sort of how it's exactly connected
*  to how the cake didn't turn out, how you had expected.
*  A lot of that is unknown,
*  but we can actually systematically try to break this down.
*  And one segment of that journey that we're looking at
*  is how that mutation gets translated
*  and acted upon in your cells.
*  And all of your cells have what's called mRNA.
*  mRNA are the actual instructions
*  that are taken from the DNA.
*  And what our work in single cell is,
*  looking at how every cell in your body
*  is actually interpreting your DNA slightly differently.
*  And what happens when healthy cells
*  are interpreting the DNA instructions
*  and when sick cells are interpreting those directions.
*  And that is a ton of data.
*  I just told you there's 37 trillion cells.
*  There's different large sets of mRNA in each cell,
*  but the work that we've been funding is looking at how,
*  first of all, gathering that information.
*  We've been incredibly lucky to be part
*  of a very fast moving field where we've gone from in 2017,
*  funding some methods work,
*  to now having really not complete,
*  but nearly complete atlases of how the human body works,
*  how flies work, how mice work at the single cell level,
*  and being able to then try to piece together,
*  like how does that all come together
*  and when you're healthy and when you're sick?
*  And the neat thing about the sort of inflection point
*  where we're at in AI,
*  is that I can't look at this data and make sense of it.
*  There's just too much of it.
*  And biology is complex, human bodies are complex.
*  We need this much information.
*  But the use of large language models
*  can help us actually look at that data and gain insights,
*  look at what trends are consistent with health
*  and what trends are unsuspected.
*  And eventually our hope through the use of these data sets
*  that we've helped curate in the application
*  of large language models is to be able
*  to formulate a virtual cell,
*  a cell that's completely built off of the data sets
*  of what we know about the human body,
*  but allows us to manipulate and learn faster
*  and try new things to help move science
*  and then medicine along.
*  Do you think we've cataloged the total number
*  of different cell types?
*  Every week I look at great journals
*  like Cell, Nature, and Science.
*  And for instance, I saw recently
*  that using single cell sequencing,
*  they've categorized 18 plus different types of fat cells.
*  We always think of like a fat cell versus a muscle cell.
*  So now you've got 18 types.
*  Each one is going to express many, many different genes
*  and RNAs, mRNAs.
*  And perhaps one of them is responsible for what we see
*  in advanced type two diabetes or in other forms of obesity
*  or where people can't lay down fat cells,
*  which turns out to be just as detrimental
*  in those extreme cases.
*  So now you've got all these lists of genes.
*  But I always thought of single cell sequencing
*  as necessary, but not sufficient.
*  You need the information, but it doesn't resolve the problem.
*  And I think of it more of it
*  as a hypothesis generating experiment.
*  Like, okay, so you have all these genes
*  and you could say, wow, this gene is particularly elevated
*  in the diabetics cell type of,
*  let's say one of these fat cells or muscle cells
*  for that matter, whereas it's not in non-diabetics.
*  So then of the millions of different cells,
*  maybe only five of them differ dramatically.
*  So then you generate a hypothesis,
*  oh, it's the ones that differ dramatically
*  that are important, but maybe one of those genes,
*  when it's only 50% changed, has a huge effect
*  because of some network biology effect.
*  And so I guess what I'm trying to get to here is,
*  how does one meet that challenge
*  and can AI help resolve that challenge
*  by essentially placing those lists of genes
*  into 10,000 hypotheses?
*  Because I'll tell you that the graduate students
*  and post-docs in my lab get a chance
*  to test one hypothesis at a time.
*  And that's really the challenge, let alone one lab.
*  And so for those that are listening to this,
*  and hopefully it's not getting outside the scope
*  of standard understanding
*  or the understanding we've generated here,
*  but what I'm basically saying is,
*  you have to pick at some point.
*  More data always sounds great,
*  but then how do you decide what to test?
*  So no, we don't know all the cell types.
*  I think one thing that was really exciting
*  when we first launched this work was cystic fibrosis.
*  Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutation in CFTR.
*  That's pretty well known.
*  It affects a certain channel that makes it hard
*  for mucus to be cleared.
*  That's the basics of cystic fibrosis.
*  When I went to medical school, it was taught as fact.
*  So their lungs fill up with fluid.
*  These are people carrying around sacks of fluid filling up.
*  I've known people, I've worked with people like that,
*  and they have to literally dump the fluid out.
*  Exactly.
*  They can't run or do intense exercise.
*  Life is shorter.
*  Life is shorter.
*  And when we applied single cell methodologies to the lungs,
*  they discovered an entirely new cell type
*  that actually is affected by a mutation in the CF mutation,
*  the cystic fibrosis mutation,
*  that actually changes the paradigm
*  of how we think about cystic fibrosis.
*  Amazing.
*  Just unknown.
*  So I don't think we know all the cell types.
*  I think we'll continue to discover them
*  and we'll continue to discover new relationships
*  between cell and disease.
*  Which leads me to the second example I wanna bring up
*  is this large data set
*  that the entire scientific community
*  has built around single cell
*  is starting to allow us to say,
*  this mutation, where is it expressed?
*  What types of cell types it's expressed in?
*  And we actually have built a tool at CZI called Cellbygene
*  where you can put in the mutation that you're interested in
*  and it gives you a heat map of cross cell types
*  of which cell types are expressing the gene
*  that you're interested in.
*  And so then you can start looking at,
*  okay, if I look at gene X
*  and I know it's related to heart disease,
*  but if you look at the heat map,
*  it's also spiking in the pancreas.
*  That allows you to generate a hypothesis, why?
*  And what happens when this gene is mutated
*  in the function of your pancreas?
*  Really exciting way to look and ask questions differently.
*  And you can also imagine a world
*  where if you're trying to develop a therapy, a drug,
*  and the goal is to treat the function of the heart,
*  but you know that it's also really active
*  in the pancreas again.
*  So is there going to be an unexpected side effect
*  that you should think about
*  as you're bringing this drug to clinical trials?
*  So it's an incredibly exciting tool
*  and one that's only going to get better
*  as we get more and more sophisticated ways
*  to analyze the data.
*  I must say I love that because if I look at the advances
*  in neuroscience over the last 15 years,
*  most of them didn't necessarily come
*  from looking at the nervous system.
*  Came from the understanding
*  that the immune system impacts the brain.
*  Everyone prior to that talked about the brain
*  as immune privileged organ.
*  What you just said also bridges the divide
*  between single cells, organs, and systems, right?
*  Because ultimately cells make up organs,
*  organs make up systems,
*  and they're all talking to one another.
*  And everyone nowadays is familiar with gut brain access
*  or the microbiome being so important,
*  but rarely is the discussion between organs discussed,
*  so to speak.
*  So I think it's wonderful.
*  So that tool was generated by CZI or CZI funded that tool.
*  So how does this-
*  We built it.
*  You built it.
*  So is it built by Metta?
*  Is this Metta?
*  No, no, no.
*  CZI has its own engineers.
*  Got it.
*  Yeah.
*  They're completely different organizations.
*  Incredible.
*  And so a graduate student or postdoc
*  who's interested in a particular mutation
*  could put this mutation into this database.
*  That graduate student or postdoc might be in a laboratory
*  known for working on heart,
*  but suddenly find that they're collaborating
*  with other scientists that work on the pancreas,
*  which also is wonderful
*  because it bridges the divide between these fields.
*  These fields are so siloed in science,
*  not just different buildings, but people rarely talk
*  unless things like this are happening.
*  I mean, the graduate student is someone
*  that we want to empower
*  because one, they're the future of science, as you know.
*  And within Cell by Gene,
*  if you put in the gene you're interested in
*  and it shows you the heat map,
*  we also will pull up the most relevant papers to that gene.
*  And so read these things.
*  Fantastic.
*  As we all know, quality nutrition influences, of course,
*  our physical health, but also our mental health
*  and our cognitive functioning, our memory,
*  our ability to learn new things and to focus.
*  And we know that one of the most important features
*  of high quality nutrition is making sure
*  that we get enough vitamins and minerals
*  from high quality, unprocessed or minimally processed sources,
*  as well as enough probiotics and prebiotics and fiber
*  to support basically all the cellular functions in our body,
*  including the gut microbiome.
*  Now, I, like most everybody,
*  try to get optimal nutrition from whole foods,
*  ideally mostly from minimally processed or non-processed foods.
*  However, one of the challenges that I
*  and so many other people face is getting enough servings
*  of high quality fruits and vegetables per day,
*  as well as fiber and probiotics
*  that often accompany those fruits and vegetables.
*  That's why way back in 2012,
*  long before I ever had a podcast,
*  I started drinking AG1.
*  And so I'm delighted that AG1
*  is sponsoring the Huberman Lab podcast.
*  The reason I started taking AG1
*  and the reason I still drink AG1 once or twice a day
*  is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs.
*  That is, it provides insurance that I get the proper amounts
*  of those vitamins, minerals, probiotics and fiber
*  to ensure optimal mental health,
*  physical health and performance.
*  If you'd like to try AG1,
*  you can go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman
*  to claim a special offer.
*  They're giving away five free travel packs
*  plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
*  Again, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman
*  to claim that special offer.
*  I just think going back to your question from before,
*  are there gonna be more cell types that get discovered?
*  I assume so.
*  No catalog of the stuff is ever,
*  it doesn't seem like we're ever done.
*  We keep on finding more.
*  But I think that that gets to one of the things
*  that I think are the strengths of modern LLMs
*  is the ability to kind of imagine different states
*  that things can be in.
*  So from all the work that we've done
*  and funded on the Human Cell Atlas,
*  there is a large corpus of data
*  that you can now train a kind of large scale model on.
*  And one of the things that we're doing at CCI,
*  which I think is pretty exciting,
*  is building what we think is one of the largest
*  nonprofit life sciences AI clusters.
*  It's like on the order of a thousand GPUs.
*  And it's larger than what most people have access to
*  in academia that you can do serious engineering work on.
*  And by basically training a model
*  with all of the Human Cell Atlas data
*  and a bunch of other inputs as well,
*  we think you'll be able to basically imagine
*  all of the different types of cells
*  and all the different states that they can be in
*  and when they're healthy and diseased
*  and how they'll interact with different,
*  interact with each other,
*  interact with different potential drugs.
*  But I mean, I think the state of LLMs,
*  this is where it's helpful to understand,
*  have a good understanding
*  and be grounded in the modern state of AI.
*  I mean, these things are not foolproof.
*  One of the flaws of modern LLMs is they hallucinate.
*  So the question is, how do you make it
*  so that that can be an advantage rather than a disadvantage?
*  And I think the way that it ends up being an advantage
*  is when they help you imagine a bunch of states
*  that someone can be in,
*  but then you as the scientist or engineer
*  go and validate that those are true,
*  whether they're solutions to how a protein can be folded
*  or possible states that a cell could be in
*  when it's interacting with other things.
*  But we're not yet at the state with AI
*  that you can just take the outputs of these things
*  as gospel and run from there.
*  But they are very good, I think as you said,
*  hypothesis generators or possible solution generators
*  that then you can go validate.
*  So I think that's a very powerful thing
*  that we can basically, building on the first five years
*  of science work around the human cell atlas
*  and all the data that's been built out,
*  carry that forward into something that I think
*  is gonna be a very novel tool going forward.
*  And that's the type of thing
*  that I think we're set up to do well.
*  I mean, you had this exchange a little while back
*  about funding levels and how CZI is just sort of a drop
*  in the bucket compared to NIH.
*  But I think we have this,
*  the thing that I think we can do that's different
*  is funding some of these longer term, bigger projects
*  that it is hard to galvanize the
*  and pull together the energy to do that.
*  And it's a lot of what most science funding is,
*  is like relatively small projects that are exploring things
*  over relatively short time horizons.
*  And one of the things that we try to do
*  is like build these tools over five, 10, 15 year periods.
*  There are often projects that require
*  hundreds of millions of dollars of funding
*  and world-class engineering teams
*  and infrastructure to do.
*  And that I think is a pretty cool contribution to the field
*  that I think is, there aren't as many other folks
*  who are doing that kind of thing.
*  But that's one of the reasons why I'm personally excited
*  about the virtual cell stuff,
*  because it's like this perfect intersection
*  of all the stuff that we've done in single cell,
*  the previous collaborations that we've done with the field
*  and bringing together the industry
*  and AI expertise around this.
*  Yeah, I completely agree that the model of science
*  that you're putting together with CZI
*  isn't just unique from NIH, but it's extremely important.
*  The independent investigator model
*  is what's driven the progression of science in this country
*  and to some extent in Northern Europe
*  for the last hundred years.
*  And it's wonderful on the one hand,
*  because it allows for that image we have of a scientist
*  kind of tinkering away or the people in their lab
*  and then the Uricas.
*  And that hopefully translates to better human health.
*  But I think in my opinion, we've moved past that model
*  as the most effective model
*  or the only model that should be explored.
*  Yeah, I just think it's a balance.
*  It's a balance.
*  You want that, but you want to empower those people.
*  I think that these tools empower those folks.
*  And there are mechanisms to do that like NIH,
*  but it's hard to do collaborative sciences.
*  It's sort of interesting that we're sitting here not far
*  because I grew up right near here as well,
*  not far from the garage model of tech, right?
*  The Hewlett-Jackard model, not far from here at all.
*  And the idea was that the tinkerer in the garage,
*  the inventor, and then people often forget
*  that to implement all the technologies they discovered
*  took enormous factories and warehouses.
*  So there's a similarity there to Facebook, Meta, et cetera.
*  But I think in science, we imagine that the scientists
*  alone in their laboratory and those eureka moments.
*  But I think nowadays the big questions really require
*  extensive collaboration and certainly tool development.
*  And one of the tools that you keep coming back to
*  is these LLMs, these large language models.
*  And maybe you could just elaborate
*  for those that aren't familiar,
*  you know, what is a large language model
*  for the uninformed?
*  What is it and what does it allow us to do
*  that different types of, other types of AI don't allow?
*  Or more importantly, perhaps,
*  what does it allow us to do that a bunch of really smart
*  people highly informed in a given area of science,
*  staring at the data, what can it do that they can't do?
*  Sure, so I think a lot of the progression of machine
*  learning has been about building systems,
*  neural networks or otherwise,
*  that can basically make sense and find patterns
*  in larger and larger amounts of data.
*  And there was a breakthrough a number of years back
*  that some folks at Google actually made
*  called this transformer model architecture.
*  And it was this huge breakthrough because before then
*  there was somewhat of a cap where, you know,
*  if you fed more data into a neural network
*  past some point, it didn't really glean more insights
*  from it, whereas transformers just,
*  you know, we haven't seen the end of how big
*  that can scale to yet.
*  I mean, I think that there's a chance
*  that we run into some ceiling, but it's-
*  So it never asymptotes.
*  We haven't observed it yet,
*  but we just haven't built big enough systems yet.
*  So I would guess that, I don't know,
*  I think that this is actually one of the big questions
*  in the AI field today is basically, are transformers
*  and are the current model architecture sufficient?
*  And if you just build larger and larger clusters,
*  do you eventually get something that's like human
*  intelligence or super intelligence?
*  Or is there some kind of fundamental limit
*  to this architecture that we just haven't reached yet?
*  And once we kind of get a little bit further
*  in building them out, then we'll reach that
*  and then we'll need a few more leaps before we get to,
*  you know, the level of AI that I think will unlock,
*  you know, a ton of really futuristic and amazing things.
*  But there's no doubt that even just being able to process
*  the amount of data that we can now
*  with this model architecture has unlocked
*  a lot of new use cases.
*  And the reason why they're called large language models
*  is because one of the first uses of them is people
*  basically feed in all of the language
*  from basically the World Wide Web.
*  And you can think about them as basically prediction machines.
*  So if you fit in, you put in a prompt
*  and it can basically, you know, predict a version
*  of what should come next.
*  So, you know, you like type in a headline for a news story
*  and it can kind of predict what it thinks the story should be.
*  Or you could train it so that it could be a chat bot, right?
*  Where, okay, if you're prompted with this question,
*  you can get this response.
*  But one of the interesting things is it turns out
*  that there's actually nothing specific
*  to using human language in it.
*  So if instead of feeding it human language,
*  if you use that model architecture for a network
*  and instead you feed it all of the human cell outlast data,
*  then if you prompt it with a state of a cell,
*  it can spit out different versions of like what, you know,
*  how that cell can interact or different states
*  that the cell could be a next
*  when it interacts with different things.
*  Does it have to take a genetics class?
*  So for instance, if you give it a bunch of genetics data,
*  do you have to say, hey, by the way,
*  and then you give it a genetics class
*  so it understands that, you know, you've got DNA, RNA,
*  mRNA and proteins.
*  No, I think that the basic nature
*  of all these machine learning techniques is they're,
*  they're basically pattern recognition systems.
*  So they're these like very deep statistical machines
*  that are very efficient at finding patterns.
*  So it's not actually, you know,
*  you don't need to teach a language model
*  that's trying to speak a language, you know,
*  a lot of specific things about that language either.
*  You just feed it in a bunch of examples.
*  And then, you know, let's say you teach it
*  about something in English,
*  but then you also give it a bunch of examples
*  of people speaking Italian.
*  It'll actually be able to explain the thing
*  that it learned in English and Italian, right?
*  So the crossover and just the pattern recognition
*  is the thing that is pretty profound
*  and powerful about this.
*  But it really does apply to a lot of different things.
*  Another example in the scientific community
*  has been the work that AlphaFold, you know,
*  that basically the folks at DeepMind have done
*  on protein folding.
*  It's, you know, just basically a lot of the same model
*  architecture, but instead of language there,
*  they kind of fed in all of these protein data
*  and you can give it a state and it can spit out solutions
*  to how those proteins get folded.
*  So it's very powerful.
*  I don't think we know yet as an industry
*  what the natural limits of it are
*  and that that's one of the things that's pretty exciting
*  about the current state,
*  but it certainly allows you to solve problems
*  that just weren't solved with the generation
*  of machine learning that came before it.
*  It sounds like CZI is moving a lot of work
*  that was just done in vitro in dishes
*  and in vivo in living organisms, model organisms or humans
*  to in silico, as we say.
*  So do you foresee a future where a lot of biomedical research,
*  certainly the work of CZI included is done by machines?
*  I mean, obviously it's much lower cost
*  and you can run millions of experiments,
*  which of course is not to say that humans
*  are not going to be involved,
*  but I love the idea that we can run experiments
*  in silico en masse.
*  I think the in silico experiments are gonna be
*  incredibly helpful to test things quickly,
*  to cheaply and to just unleash a lot of creativity.
*  I do think you need to be very careful
*  about making sure it still translates
*  and matches this humans.
*  One thing that's funny in basic science
*  is we've basically cured every single disease in mice.
*  Like mice have, we know what's going on
*  when they have a number of diseases
*  because they're used as a model organism,
*  but they are not humans and a lot of times
*  that research is relevant,
*  but not directly one-to-one translatable to humans.
*  So you just have to be really careful
*  about making sure that it actually works for humans.
*  Sounds like what CZI is doing
*  is actually creating a new field.
*  As I'm hearing all of this, I'm thinking,
*  okay, this transcends immunology department,
*  cardiothoracic surgery, neuroscience.
*  The idea of a new field where you certainly embrace
*  the realities of universities and laboratories
*  because that's where most of the work
*  that you're funding is done, is that right?
*  So maybe we need to think about
*  what it means to do science differently.
*  And I think that's one of the things that's most exciting.
*  Along those lines, it seems that bringing together
*  a lot of different types of people
*  at different major institutions
*  is going to be especially important.
*  So I know that the initial CZI Biohub gratefully
*  included Stanford.
*  We'll put that first in the list, but also UCSF.
*  Forgive me.
*  Many friends at UCSF and also Berkeley.
*  But there are now some additional institutions involved.
*  So maybe you could talk about that
*  and what motivated the decision
*  to branch outside the Bay Area
*  and why you selected those particular
*  additional institutions to be included.
*  Well, I mean, I'll just say a big part of why
*  we wanted to create additional Biohubs
*  is we were just so impressed by the work
*  that the folks who are running the first Biohub did.
*  And I also think, and you should walk through
*  the work of the Chicago Biohub
*  and the New York Biohub that we just announced.
*  But I think it's actually an interesting set of examples
*  that balance the limits of what you wanna do
*  with physical material engineering
*  and where things are purely biological.
*  Because the Chicago team is really building more sensors
*  to be able to understand what's going on in your body.
*  But that's more of a physical engineering challenge.
*  Whereas the New York team, we basically talk about this
*  as like a cellular endoscope of being able to have
*  like an immune cell or something that can go
*  and understand what's the thing that's going on in your body
*  but it's not like a physical piece of hardware.
*  It's a cell that you can basically have
*  just go report out on different things
*  that are happening inside the body.
*  So you should- Ooh, so making the cell the microscope.
*  Totally. Yeah, and then eventually
*  actually being able to act on it.
*  But I mean, but you should go into more detail on all this.
*  So a core principle of how we think about Biohubs
*  is that it has to be, when we invited proposals,
*  it has to be at least three institutions.
*  So really breaking down the barrier of a single university,
*  oftentimes asking for the people designing the research aim
*  to come from all different backgrounds.
*  And to explain why that the problem that they wanna solve
*  requires interdisciplinary, inter university institution
*  collaboration to actually make happen.
*  We just put that request for proposal out there
*  with our San Francisco Biohub as an example,
*  where they've done incredible work in single cell biology
*  and infectious disease.
*  And we got, I wanna say like 57 proposals
*  from over 150 institutions.
*  A lot of ideas came together.
*  And we are so, so excited that we've been able to launch
*  Chicago and New York.
*  Chicago is a collaboration between UIUC,
*  University of Illinois, Irina Champagne,
*  and University of Chicago and Northwestern.
*  And if I, obviously these universities are multifaceted,
*  but if I were to sort of describe them
*  by their like stereotypical strength,
*  Northwestern has an incredible medical system
*  and hospital system.
*  University of Chicago brings to the table
*  incredible basic science strengths.
*  University of Illinois is a computing powerhouse.
*  And so they came together and proposed
*  that they were gonna start thinking about cells and tissue.
*  So that one of the layers that you just alluded to.
*  So how do the cells that we know behave and act differently
*  when they come together as a tissue?
*  And the first, one of the first issues
*  that they're starting with is skin.
*  So they've been already been able to,
*  as a collaboration under the leadership of Shana Kelly,
*  design engineered skin tissue.
*  The architecture looks the same as what's in UNI.
*  And what they've done is built these super,
*  super thin sensors and they embed these sensors
*  throughout the layers of this engineered tissue.
*  And they read out the data.
*  They wanna see how these cells,
*  what these cells are secreting,
*  how these cells talk to each other
*  and what happens when these cells get inflamed.
*  Inflammation is an incredibly important process
*  that drives 50% of all deaths.
*  And so this is another sort of disease agnostic approach.
*  We wanna understand inflammation.
*  And they're gonna get a ton of information
*  out from these sensors that tell you
*  what happens when something goes awry.
*  Because right now we can say,
*  when you have an allergic reaction,
*  your skin gets red and puffy.
*  But what is the earliest signal of that?
*  And these sensors can look at the behaviors
*  of these cells over time.
*  And then you can apply a large language model
*  to look at the earliest statistically significant changes
*  that can allow you to intervene as early as possible.
*  So that's what Chicago's doing.
*  They're starting in the skin cells.
*  They're also looking at the neuromuscular junction,
*  which is the connection between where a neuron
*  attaches to a muscle and tells the muscle how to behave.
*  Super important in things like ALS, but also in aging.
*  The slowed transmission of information
*  across that neuromuscular junction
*  is what causes old people to fall.
*  Their brain cannot trigger their muscles
*  to react fast enough.
*  And so we wanna be able to embed these sensors
*  to understand how these different interconnected systems
*  within our bodies work together.
*  In New York, they're doing a related,
*  but equally exciting project
*  where they're engineering individual cells
*  to be able to go in and identify changes in a human body.
*  So what they'll do is, they're calling us, it's a unit.
*  It's wild, I mean, I love it.
*  I mean, this is, I don't wanna go on a tangent,
*  but for those that wanna look it up, adaptive optics,
*  you know, there's a lot of distortion and interference
*  when you try and look at something really small
*  or really far away, and really smart physicists
*  figured out, well, use the interference
*  as part of the microscope,
*  make those actually lenses of the microscope.
*  We should talk about imaging separately
*  after you talk about the New York Biohub.
*  It's extremely clever along those lines.
*  It's not intuitive, but then when you hear it,
*  it's like, it makes so much sense.
*  It's not immediately intuitive.
*  Make the cells that are already can navigate to tissues
*  or embed themselves in tissues,
*  be the microscope within that tissue.
*  Totally. I love it.
*  The way that I explain this to my friends and my family is,
*  this is fantastic voyage, but real life.
*  Like we are going into the human body
*  and we're using the immune cells,
*  which, you know, are privileged
*  and already working to keep your body healthy
*  and being able to target them to examine certain things.
*  So like you can engineer an immune cell to go in your body
*  and look inside your coronary arteries and say,
*  are these arteries healthy or are there plaques?
*  Because plaques lead to blockage,
*  which lead to heart attacks.
*  And the cell can then record that information
*  and report it back out.
*  That's the first half of what the New York Biohub
*  is going to do.
*  The second half is, can you then engineer the cells
*  to go do something about it?
*  Can I then tell a different cell, immune cell,
*  that is able to transport in your body to go in
*  and clean that up in a targeted way?
*  And so it's incredibly exciting.
*  They're going to study things that are sort of immune
*  privilege that your immune system
*  normally doesn't have access to.
*  Things like ovarian and pancreatic cancer.
*  They'll also look at a number of neurodegenerative diseases
*  since the immune system doesn't presently have a ton of access
*  into the nervous system.
*  But it's both mind blowing and it feels like sci-fi,
*  but science is actually in a place where if you really
*  pushed a group of incredibly qualified scientists,
*  say, could you do this if given the chance?
*  The answer is like, probably.
*  Give us enough time, the right team and resources,
*  like it's doable.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a 10 to 15 year project.
*  But it's awesome, engineered cells, yeah.
*  I love the optimism and the moment you said
*  make the cell the microscope.
*  So it's like, yes, yes, and yes.
*  It just makes so much sense.
*  What motivated the decision to do the work of CZI
*  in the context of existing universities, as opposed to,
*  there's still some real estate up in Redwood City
*  where there's a bunch of space to put biotech companies
*  and just hiring people from all backgrounds
*  and saying, hey, have at it
*  and doing this stuff from scratch.
*  I mean, it's a very interesting decision to do this
*  in the context of an existing framework
*  of like graduate students that need to do a thesis
*  and get a first author paper.
*  Because there's a whole set of structures within academia
*  that I think both facilitate,
*  but also limit the progression of science.
*  That independent investigator model
*  that we talked about a little bit earlier,
*  it's so core to the way science has been done.
*  This is very different and frankly sounds far more efficient
*  if I'm to be completely honest.
*  And we'll see if I renew my NIH funding after saying that.
*  But I think we all want the same thing.
*  We all want to, as scientists and as humans,
*  we want to understand the way we work
*  and we want healthy people to persist to be healthy
*  and we want sick people to get healthy.
*  I mean, that's really ultimately the goal.
*  It's not super complicated, it's just hard to do.
*  So the teams at the Biohub
*  are actually independent of the universities.
*  So each Biohub will probably have in total,
*  maybe 50 people working on sort of deep efforts.
*  However, it's an acknowledgement
*  that not all of the best scientists
*  who can contribute to this area
*  are actually going to one, want to leave a university,
*  or want to take on the full-time scope of this project.
*  So it's the ability to partner with universities
*  and to have the faculty at all the universities
*  be able to contribute to the overall project
*  is how the Biohub is structured.
*  But a lot of the way that we're approaching CZI
*  is this long-term iterative project to figure out,
*  try a bunch of different things,
*  figure out which things produce
*  the most interesting results,
*  and then double down on those in the next five-year push.
*  So we just went through this period
*  where we kind of wrapped up the first five years
*  of the science program,
*  and we tried a lot of different models,
*  all kinds of different things.
*  And it's not that the Biohub model,
*  we don't think it's the best or only model,
*  but we found that it was sort of a really interesting way
*  to unlock a bunch of collaboration
*  and bring some technical resources
*  that allow for this longer-term development.
*  And it's not something that is widely being pursued
*  across the rest of the field.
*  So we figured, okay, this is an interesting thing
*  that we can now push on.
*  But I mean, yeah, we do believe in the collaboration,
*  but I also think that we come at this with,
*  we don't think that the way that we're pursuing this
*  is the only way to do this
*  or the way that everyone should do it.
*  We're pretty aware of what is the rest of the ecosystem
*  and how we can play a unique role in it.
*  It feels very synergistic
*  with the way science has already done
*  and also fills in an incredibly important niche
*  that frankly wasn't filled before.
*  Along the lines of implementation,
*  so let's say your large language models
*  combined with imaging tools
*  reveal that a particular set of genes acting in a cluster,
*  I don't know, set up an organ crash,
*  let's say the pancreas crashes
*  at a particular stage of pancreatic cancer.
*  I mean, still one of the most deadliest of the cancers.
*  And there are others that you certainly wouldn't want to get,
*  but that's among the ones you wouldn't want to get the most.
*  So you discover that.
*  And the idea is that, okay,
*  then AI reveals some potential drug targets,
*  but then bear out in vitro in a dish and in a mouse model.
*  How is the actual implementation to drug discovery?
*  Or maybe this target is druggable, maybe it's not.
*  Maybe it requires some other approach,
*  laser ablation approach or something.
*  We don't know.
*  But ultimately, is CZI going to be involved
*  in the implementation of new therapeutics?
*  Is that the idea?
*  Less so.
*  Less so.
*  That's, you know, this is where it's important
*  to work in an ecosystem and to know your own limitations.
*  Like there are groups and startups and companies
*  that take that and bring it to translation very effectively.
*  I would say the place where we have a small window
*  into that world is actually our work
*  with rare disease groups.
*  We have, through our rare as one portfolio,
*  funded patient advocates to create
*  rare disease organizations where patients come together
*  and actually pool their collective experience.
*  They build bioregistries,
*  registries of their natural history,
*  and they both partner with researchers
*  to do the research about their disease
*  and with drug developers to incentivize drug developers
*  to focus on what they may need for their disease.
*  And, you know, one thing that's important to point out
*  is that rare diseases aren't rare.
*  There are over 7,000 rare diseases
*  and collectively impact many, many individuals.
*  And I think the thing that's from a basic science perspective,
*  the incredibly fascinating thing about rare diseases
*  is that they're actually windows
*  to how the body normally should work.
*  And so there are often mutations that,
*  when genes that were, when they're mutated,
*  cause very specific diseases,
*  but that tell you how the normal biology works as well.
*  Got it.
*  So you discussed basically the goals,
*  major goals and initiatives of the CZI
*  for the next five to 10 years.
*  And then beyond that,
*  the targets will be explored by biotech companies.
*  They'll grab those targets and test them and implement them.
*  There have also, I think, been a couple of teams
*  from the initial Biohub that were interested
*  in spinning out ideas into startups.
*  So even though it's not a thing that we're gonna pursue
*  because we're a philanthropy,
*  we want to enable the work that gets done
*  to be able to get turned into companies
*  and things that other people go take
*  and run towards building, you know, ultimately therapeutics.
*  So that's another zone,
*  but that's not a thing that we're gonna do.
*  Got it.
*  I gather you're both optimists.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  Yeah.
*  Is that part of what brought you together?
*  Forgive me for switching to a personal question,
*  but I love the optimism
*  that seems to sit at the root of the CZI.
*  I will say that we are incredibly hopeful people,
*  but it manifests in different ways between the two of us.
*  Yeah.
*  How would you describe your optimism versus mine?
*  It's not a loaded question.
*  I don't know.
*  Huh.
*  I mean, I think I'm more probably technologically optimistic
*  about what can be built,
*  and I think you, because of your focus as an actual doctor,
*  kind of have more of a sense
*  of how that's gonna affect actual people in their lives.
*  Whereas for me, it's like, I mean, a lot of my work,
*  it's like we touch a lot of people around the world,
*  and the scale is sort of immense.
*  And I think for you,
*  it's like being able to improve the lives of individuals,
*  whether it's students at any of the schools
*  that you've started or any of the stuff
*  that we've supported through the education work,
*  which isn't the goal here,
*  or just being able to improve people's lives in that way,
*  I think is the thing that I've seen you
*  be super passionate about.
*  I don't know, do you agree with that characterization?
*  I'm trying to...
*  Yeah, I agree with that.
*  I think that's very fair,
*  and I'm sort of giggling to myself,
*  because in a day-to-day life as life partners,
*  our relative optimism comes through as Mark just like
*  is overly optimistic about his time management,
*  and will get engrossed in interesting ideas.
*  I'm late.
*  And he's late.
*  Physicians are very punctual.
*  And because he's late,
*  I have to channel Mark as an optimist
*  whenever I'm waiting for him.
*  That's such a nice way.
*  Okay, I'll start using that.
*  That's what I think when I'm in the driveway
*  with the kids waiting for you.
*  I'm like, Mark is an optimist.
*  And so his optimism translates to some tardiness,
*  whereas I'm sort of, I'm like,
*  how is this gonna happen?
*  I'm gonna open a spreadsheet.
*  I'm gonna start putting together a plan,
*  and pulling together all the pieces,
*  calling people to sort of bring something to life.
*  But it's one of my favorite quotes that is,
*  optimists tend to be successful,
*  and pessimists tend to be right.
*  And yeah, I mean, I think it's true
*  in a lot of different aspects of life.
*  Right, it's like- We know who said that.
*  Did you say that?
*  No, no, no, I did not.
*  No, no, absolutely not.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
*  I like it, I did not invent it.
*  We'll give it to you, we'll put it out there.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
*  Just kidding, just kidding.
*  But I do think that there's really something to it, right?
*  And there's like, if you're discussing any idea,
*  there's all these reasons why it might not work.
*  And so I think that, and those reasons are probably true,
*  the people who are stating them are,
*  probably have some validity to it.
*  But the question is that,
*  is that the most productive way to view the world?
*  And I think across the board,
*  I think the people who tend to be the most productive
*  and get the most done, you kind of need to be optimistic.
*  Because if you don't believe that someone can get done,
*  then why would you go work on it?
*  The reason I ask the question is that,
*  these days we hear a lot about the future is looking so dark
*  in these various ways.
*  And you have children, so you have families,
*  and you are a family, excuse me,
*  and you also have families independently
*  that are now merged.
*  But I love the optimism behind the CZI,
*  because behind all this,
*  there's sort of a set of big statements on the wall.
*  One, the future can be better than the present
*  in terms of treating disease.
*  Maybe even, you said eliminating diseases, all diseases.
*  I love that optimism.
*  And that there's a tractable path to do it.
*  We're going to put money and time and energy and people
*  and technology and AI behind that.
*  And so I have to ask,
*  was having children a significant modifier
*  in terms of your view of the future?
*  Wow, you hear all this doom and gloom.
*  What's the future going to be like for them?
*  Did you sit back and think,
*  what would it look like if there was a future
*  with no diseases?
*  Is that the future we want our children in?
*  I'm voting a big yes.
*  So we're not going to debate that at all.
*  But was having children a sort of an inspiration
*  for the CZI in some way?
*  Yeah.
*  So I think my answer to that,
*  I would dial backwards for me.
*  And I'll just tell a very brief story about my family.
*  I'm the daughter of Chinese Vietnamese refugees.
*  My parents and grandparents were boat people.
*  If you remember, people left Vietnam during the war
*  in these small boats into the South China Sea.
*  And there were stories about how these boats
*  would sink with whole families on them.
*  And so my grandparents,
*  both sets of grandparents who knew each other,
*  decided that there was a better future out there
*  and they were willing to take risks for it.
*  But they were afraid of losing all of their kids.
*  My dad is one of six, my mom is one of 10.
*  And so they decided that there was something out there
*  in this bleak time and they paired up their kids,
*  one from each family,
*  and sent them out on these little boats
*  before the internet, before cell phones,
*  and just said, we'll see you on the other side.
*  And the kids were between the ages of like 10 to 25.
*  So young kids, my mom was a teenager.
*  Early teen when this happened.
*  And everyone made it.
*  And I get to sit here and talk to you.
*  So how could I not believe that better is possible?
*  And I hope that that's in my epigenetics somewhere
*  and that I carry that on.
*  That is a spectacular story.
*  Isn't that wild?
*  It is spectacular.
*  How can I be a pessimist with that?
*  I love it.
*  And I so appreciate that you became a physician
*  because you're now bringing that optimism
*  and epigenetic understanding and cognitive understanding
*  and emotional understanding to the field of medicine.
*  So I'm grateful to the people that made that decision.
*  Yeah.
*  And then, I think you don't,
*  I've always known that story,
*  but you don't understand how wild that feels
*  until you have your own child.
*  And you're like, well, I refuse to let her use
*  glass bottles only or something like that.
*  And you're like, oh my God.
*  The risk and the sort of willingness of my grandparents
*  to believe in something bigger and better
*  is just astounding.
*  And our own children sort of give it a sense of urgency.
*  Yeah, and spectacular story.
*  And you're sending knowledge out into the fields of science
*  and bringing knowledge into the fields of science.
*  And I love this.
*  We'll see you on the other side.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm confident that it will all come back.
*  Well, thank you so much for that.
*  Marco, you have the opportunity to talk about
*  did having kids change your worldview?
*  It's really tough to beat that story.
*  It is tough to beat that story.
*  And they are also your children.
*  So in this case, you get two for the price of one,
*  so to speak.
*  Having children definitely changes your time horizon.
*  So I think that that's one thing is you just,
*  like there were all these things that I think we had talked
*  about for as long as we've known each other
*  that you eventually wanna go do,
*  but then it's like, oh, we're having kids.
*  We need to get on this, right?
*  So I think there's-
*  That was actually one of the checklists,
*  the baby checklist before the first.
*  It was like the baby's coming.
*  We have to start CZI.
*  Truly.
*  And sitting in the hospital delivery room,
*  finishing editing the letter that we were going to publish
*  to announce the work that we're doing on CZI.
*  Some people think that was an exaggeration.
*  It was not.
*  We really were editing the final draft.
*  Birth CZI before you birthed your own child.
*  Well, it's an incredible initiative.
*  I've been following it since its inception
*  and it's already been tremendously successful
*  and everyone in the field of science
*  and I have a lot of communication with those folks,
*  feels the same way and the future is even brighter for it.
*  It's clear.
*  And thank you for expanding to the Midwest and New York.
*  And we're all very excited to see where all of this goes.
*  I share in your optimism.
*  And thank you for your time today.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  I'd like to take a quick break
*  and thank our sponsor InsideTracker.
*  InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
*  that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
*  to help you better understand your body
*  and help you reach your health goals.
*  I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
*  for the simple reason that many of the factors
*  that impact your immediate and long-term health
*  can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
*  Now, a major problem with a lot of blood tests out there,
*  however, is that you get information back
*  about metabolic factors, lipids and hormones
*  and so forth, but you don't know what to do
*  with that information.
*  With InsideTracker, they make it very easy
*  because they have a personalized platform
*  that allows you to see the levels of all those things,
*  metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, et cetera,
*  but it gives you specific directives that you can follow
*  that relate to nutrition, behavioral modification,
*  supplements, et cetera, that can help you bring
*  those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you.
*  If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
*  you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman
*  to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
*  Again, that's insidetracker.com slash Huberman.
*  And now for my discussion with Mark Zuckerberg.
*  Slight shift of topic here.
*  You're extremely well known for your role
*  in technology development,
*  but by virtue of your personal interests
*  and also where meta technology interfaces
*  with mental health and physical health,
*  you're starting to become synonymous with health,
*  whether you realize it or not.
*  Part of that is because there's post footage
*  of you rolling jujitsu,
*  you won a jujitsu competition recently,
*  you're doing other forms of martial arts,
*  water sports, including surfing and on and on.
*  So you're doing it yourself,
*  but maybe we could just start off with technology
*  and get this issue out of the way first,
*  which is that I think many people assume that technology,
*  especially technology that involves a screen, excuse me,
*  of any kind is going to be detrimental to our health,
*  but that doesn't necessarily have to be the case.
*  So could you explain how you see technology meshing with,
*  inhibiting, or maybe even promoting
*  physical and mental health?
*  Sure, I mean, I think this is a really important topic.
*  It's, you know, the research that we've done
*  suggests that it's not like all good or all bad.
*  I think how you're using the technology has a big impact
*  on whether it is basically a positive experience for you.
*  And even within technology, even within social media,
*  there's not kind of one type of thing that people do.
*  I think at its best, you're forming
*  meaningful connections with other people.
*  And there's a lot of research that basically suggests that,
*  it's the relationships that we have and the friendships
*  that kind of bring the most happiness in our lives.
*  And at some level end up even correlating
*  with living a longer and healthier life,
*  because that kind of grounding that you have in community
*  ends up being important for that.
*  So I think that that aspect of social media,
*  which is the ability to connect with people,
*  to understand what's going on in people's lives,
*  have empathy for them,
*  communicate what's going on with your life, express that.
*  That's generally positive.
*  There are ways that it can be negative
*  in terms of bad interactions, things like bullying,
*  which we can talk about because there's a lot
*  that we've done to basically make sure
*  that people can be safe from that and give people tools
*  and give kids the ability to have the right
*  parental controls, that their parents can oversee that.
*  But that's sort of the interacting with people side.
*  There's another side of all this,
*  which I think of as just like passive consumption,
*  which at its best, it's entertainment.
*  And entertainment is an important human thing too.
*  But I don't think that that has quite the same association
*  with the long-term wellbeing and health benefits
*  as being able to help people connect with other people does.
*  And I think at its worst,
*  some of the stuff that we see online,
*  I think these days a lot of the news
*  is just so relentlessly negative,
*  that it's just hard to come away from an experience
*  where you're looking at the news for half an hour
*  and like feel better about the world.
*  So I think that there's a mix on this.
*  I think the more that social media
*  is about connecting with people
*  and the more that when you're kind of consuming
*  and using the media part of social media
*  to learn about things that kind of enrich you
*  and can provide inspiration or education,
*  as opposed to things that just leave you
*  with a more toxic feeling,
*  that that's sort of the balance that we try to get right
*  across our products.
*  And I think we're pretty aligned with the community
*  because at the end of the day,
*  people don't want to use a product
*  and come away feeling bad.
*  There's a lot that people talk about,
*  value a lot of these products
*  in terms of information and utility,
*  but I think it's as important when you're designing a product
*  to think about what kind of feeling you're creating
*  with the people who use it,
*  whether that's kind of an aesthetic sense
*  when you're designing hardware
*  or just kind of like what do you make people feel?
*  And generally people don't want to feel bad.
*  So I think that doesn't mean that we want to
*  shelter people from bad things
*  that are happening in the world,
*  but I don't really think that,
*  it's not what people want for us to just be kind of
*  just showing like all this super negative stuff all day long.
*  So we work hard on all these different problems,
*  making sure that we're helping connect people
*  as best as possible,
*  helping make sure that we give people good tools
*  to block people who might be bullying them or harass them,
*  or especially for younger folks,
*  anyone under the age of 16 defaults into an experience
*  where their experience is private.
*  We have all these parental tools.
*  So that way parents can kind of understand
*  what their children are up to in a good balance.
*  And then on the other side,
*  we try to give people tools to understand
*  how they're spending their time.
*  And we try to give people tools so that,
*  if you're a teen and you're kind of stuck in some loop
*  of just looking at one type of content,
*  we'll nudge you and say,
*  hey, you've been looking at content of this type
*  for a while, like how about something else?
*  And here's a bunch of other examples.
*  So I think that there are things that you can do
*  to kind of push this in a positive direction.
*  But I think it just starts with having a more nuanced view
*  of like, this isn't all good or all bad.
*  And the more that you can make it kind of a positive thing,
*  the better this will be for all the people
*  who use our products.
*  That makes really good sense.
*  In terms of the negative experience, I agree.
*  I don't think anyone wants a negative experience
*  in the moment.
*  I think where some people get concerned perhaps,
*  and I think about my own interactions with say Instagram,
*  which I use all the time for getting information out,
*  but also consuming information.
*  And I happen to love it.
*  It's where I essentially launched the non-podcast segment
*  of my podcast and continue to.
*  I can think of experiences that are a little bit
*  like highly processed food, where it tastes good at the time.
*  It's highly engrossing, but it's not necessarily nutritious
*  and you don't feel very good afterwards.
*  So for me, that would be the little collage
*  of default options to click on in Instagram.
*  Occasionally I notice, and this just reflects my failure,
*  not Instagram's, right?
*  That there are a lot of like street fight things,
*  like people beating people up on the street.
*  And I have to say these have a very strong
*  gravitational pull.
*  I'm not somebody that enjoys seeing violence per se,
*  but I find myself, I'll click on one of these,
*  like what happened?
*  And I'll see someone like get hit,
*  and there's like a little melee on the street or something.
*  And those seem to be offered to me a lot lately.
*  And again, this is my fault.
*  It reflects my prior searching experience.
*  But I noticed that it has a bit of a gravitational pull
*  where I didn't learn anything.
*  It's not teaching me any kind of useful street
*  self-defense skills of any kind.
*  And at the same time, I also really enjoy
*  some of the cute animal stuff.
*  And so I get a lot of those also.
*  So there's this polarized collage that's offered to me
*  that reflects my prior search behavior.
*  You could argue that the cute animal stuff
*  is just entertainment, but actually it fills me
*  with a feeling in some cases that truly delights me.
*  I delight in animals.
*  And we're not just talking about kittens.
*  I mean, animals I've never seen before,
*  interactions between animals I've never seen before
*  that truly delight me.
*  They energize me in a positive way
*  that when I leave Instagram, I do think I'm better off.
*  So I'm grateful for the algorithm in that sense.
*  But I guess the direct question is,
*  is the algorithm just reflective of what one
*  has been looking at a lot prior to that moment
*  where they log on?
*  Or is it also trying to do exactly what you described,
*  which is trying to give people a good feeling experience
*  that leads to more good feelings?
*  Yeah, I mean, I think we try to do this in a long-term way.
*  Right, I think one simple example of this
*  is we had this issue a number of years back
*  about clickbait news, right?
*  So articles that would have basically a headline
*  that grabbed your attention, that made you feel like,
*  oh, I need to click on this.
*  Then you click on it.
*  And then the article is actually about something
*  that's somewhat tangential to it, but people clicked on it.
*  So the naive version of this stuff,
*  the 10-year-old version, it was like,
*  oh, people seem to be clicking on this.
*  Maybe that's good.
*  But it's actually a pretty straightforward exercise
*  to instrument the system to realize that,
*  hey, people click on this and then they don't really
*  spend a lot of time reading the news
*  after clicking on it.
*  And after they do this a few times,
*  it doesn't really correlate with them saying
*  that they're having a good experience.
*  Some of how we measure this is just by looking
*  at how people use the services,
*  but it's also important to balance that by having
*  real people come in and tell us, okay, we show them,
*  here are the stories that we could have showed you.
*  Which of these are most meaningful to you
*  or would make it so that you have the best experience
*  and just kind of mapping the algorithm
*  and what we do to that ground truth
*  of what people say that they want.
*  So I think that through a set of things like that,
*  we really have made large steps to minimize things
*  like clickbait over time.
*  It's not like gone from the internet,
*  but I think we've done a good job of minimizing it
*  on our services.
*  Within that though, I do think that we need to be
*  pretty careful about not being paternalistic
*  about what makes different people feel good.
*  Right, so I mean, I don't know that everyone feels good
*  about cute animals.
*  I mean, I can't imagine that people would feel
*  really bad about it, but maybe they don't have
*  as profound of a positive reaction to it
*  as you just expressed.
*  And I don't know, maybe people who are more into fighting
*  would look at the street fighting videos,
*  assuming that they're within our community standards.
*  I think that there's a level of violence
*  that we just don't wanna be showing at all,
*  but that's a separate question.
*  But if they are, I mean, it's like, I'm pretty into MMA.
*  I don't get a lot of street fighting videos,
*  but if I did, maybe I'd feel like I was learning
*  something from that.
*  I think at various times in the company's history,
*  we've been a little bit too paternalistic
*  about saying this is good content, this is bad.
*  You should like this, this is unhealthy for you.
*  And I think that we wanna look at the long-term effects.
*  So you don't wanna get stuck in a short-term loop of like,
*  okay, just cause you did this today doesn't mean
*  it's like what you aspire for yourself over time.
*  But I think as long as you look at the long-term
*  of what people both say they want and what they do,
*  giving people a fair amount of latitude
*  to like the things that they like,
*  I just think feels like the right set of values
*  to bring to this.
*  Now, of course, that doesn't go for everything.
*  There are things that are kind of truly off limits
*  and things that like bullying, for example,
*  or things that are really like inciting violence,
*  things like that.
*  I mean, we have the whole community standards around this.
*  But I think except for those things,
*  which I would hope that most people can agree,
*  okay, bullying is bad, right?
*  I hope that 100% of people agree with that,
*  not 100, maybe 99%.
*  Except for the things that kind of get that
*  sort of very, that feel pretty extreme and bad like that.
*  I think you wanna give people space
*  to like what they wanna like.
*  Yesterday, I had the very good experience
*  of learning from the meta team about safety protections
*  that are in place for kids who are using meta platforms.
*  And frankly, I was like really positively surprised
*  at the huge number of filter-based tools
*  and just ability to customize the experience
*  so that it can stand the best chance of enriching,
*  not just remaining neutral,
*  but enriching their mental health status.
*  One thing that came about in that conversation, however,
*  was I realized there are all these tools,
*  but do people really know that these tools exist?
*  And I think about my own experience with Instagram.
*  I love watching Adam Aseri's Friday Q&As
*  because he explains a lot of the tools
*  that I didn't know existed.
*  And if people haven't seen that,
*  I highly recommend they watch that.
*  I think every, he takes questions on Thursdays
*  and answers them most every Friday.
*  So if I'm not aware of the tools without watching that
*  that exists for adults,
*  how does meta look at the challenge
*  of making sure that people know that there are all these tools?
*  I mean, dozens and dozens of very useful tools,
*  but I think most of us just know the hashtag, the tag,
*  the click, stories versus feed.
*  We now know that I also post to threads.
*  I mean, so we know the major channels and tools,
*  but this is like owning a vehicle
*  that has incredible features
*  that one doesn't realize can take you off road,
*  can allow your vehicle to fly.
*  There's a lot there.
*  So what do you think could be done
*  to get that information out?
*  Maybe this conversation could cue people to their existence.
*  That's part of the reason why I wanted to talk to you
*  about this is, I mean,
*  I think most of the narrative around social media
*  is not, okay, all of the different tools
*  that people have to control their experience.
*  It's the kind of narrative of,
*  is this just negative for teens or something?
*  And I think, again, a lot of this comes down to,
*  how is the experience being tuned?
*  And is it actually,
*  like are people using it to connect in positive ways?
*  And if so, I think it's really positive.
*  So yeah, I mean, I think part of this is,
*  we probably just need to get out
*  and talk to people more about it.
*  And then there's an in-product aspect,
*  which is, if you're a teen and you sign up,
*  we take you through a pretty extensive experience
*  that tries to outline some of this,
*  but that has limits too, right?
*  Because when you sign up for a new thing,
*  if you're bombarded with like, here's a list of features,
*  you're like, okay, I just signed up for this.
*  I don't really understand much about what the service is.
*  Like, let me go find some people to follow
*  who are my friends on here before I like learn
*  about controls to prevent people
*  from harassing me or something.
*  That's why I think it's really important
*  to also show a bunch of these tools in context.
*  So, if you're looking at comments,
*  and if you go to delete a comment
*  or you go to edit something,
*  try to give people prompts in line.
*  It's like, hey, did you know that you can manage things
*  in these ways around that?
*  Or when you're in the inbox
*  and you're filtering something, right?
*  It's remind people in line.
*  So, I note just because of the number of people
*  who use the products and the level of nuance
*  around each of the controls,
*  I think the vast majority of that education, I think,
*  needs to happen in the product.
*  But I do think that through conversations like this
*  and others that we need to be doing,
*  I think we can create a broader awareness
*  that those things exist so that way,
*  at least people are primed.
*  So that way, when those things pop up in the product,
*  people are like, oh yeah,
*  I knew that there was this control
*  and here's how I would use that.
*  I find the restrict function to be very useful
*  more than the block function.
*  In most cases, I do sometimes have the block function,
*  but the restrict function is really useful
*  that you could filter specific comments.
*  You might recognize that someone has a tendency
*  to be a little aggressive.
*  And I should point out that I actually don't really mind
*  what people say to me,
*  but I try and maintain what I call classroom rules
*  in my comment section
*  where I don't like people attacking other people
*  because I would never tolerate that
*  in the university classroom.
*  I'm not gonna tolerate that in the comment section,
*  for instance.
*  Yeah, and I think that the example that you just used
*  about restrict versus block
*  gets to something about product design that's important too,
*  which is that block is sort of this very powerful tool
*  that if someone is giving you a hard time
*  and you just want them to disappear from the experience,
*  you can do it.
*  But the design trade-off with that
*  is that in order to make it so that
*  the person is just gone from the experience
*  in that you don't show up to them,
*  they don't show up to you,
*  inherent to that is that they will have a sense
*  that you blocked them.
*  And that's why I think some stuff like restrict
*  or just filtering,
*  like I just don't wanna see as much stuff about this topic.
*  People like using different tools for very subtle reasons.
*  Maybe you want the content to not show up,
*  but you don't want the person who's posting the content
*  to know that you don't want it to show up.
*  Maybe you don't wanna get the messages in your main inbox,
*  but you don't wanna tell the person
*  that you're not friends or something like that.
*  You actually need to give people different tools
*  that have different levels of power and nuance
*  around how the social dynamics are and using them play out
*  in order to really allow people to tailor the experience
*  in the ways that they want.
*  In terms of trying to limit total amount of time
*  on social media,
*  I couldn't find really good data on this.
*  How much time is too much?
*  I think it's gonna depend on what one is looking at,
*  the age of the user, et cetera.
*  But I know that you have tools that cue the user
*  to how long they've been on a given platform.
*  Are there tools to self-regulate,
*  like I'm thinking about the Greek myth of the sirens
*  and people tying themselves to the mast
*  and covering their eyes
*  so that they're not drawn in by the sirens.
*  Is there a function aside from deleting the app temporarily
*  and then reinstalling it every time
*  and you wanna use it again,
*  is there a true lockout, self-lockout function
*  where one can lock themselves out of access to the app?
*  Well, I think we give people tools
*  that let them manage this.
*  And there's the tools that you get to use
*  and then there's the tools that the parents get to use
*  to basically see how the usage works.
*  But yeah, I think that there's different kind of,
*  and I think for now we've mostly focused on
*  helping people understand this
*  and then give people reminders and things like that.
*  It's tough though to answer the question
*  that you were talking about before this
*  of is there an amount of time which is too much?
*  Because it does really get to what you're doing.
*  But if you fast forward beyond just the apps
*  that we have today to an experience
*  that is like a social experience in the future
*  of the augmented reality glasses
*  or something that we're building,
*  a lot of this is gonna be,
*  you're interacting with people
*  in the way that you would physically
*  as if you were kind of like hanging out with friends
*  or working with people.
*  But now they can show up as holograms
*  and you can feel like you're present right there with them
*  no matter where they actually are.
*  And the question is, is there too much time to spend
*  interacting with people like that?
*  Well, at the limit, if we can get that experience
*  to be kind of as rich and giving you
*  as good of a sense of presence
*  as you would have if you were physically there with someone,
*  then I don't see why you would wanna restrict the amount
*  that people use that technology to any less
*  than what would be the amount of time
*  that you'd be comfortable interacting
*  with people physically.
*  Which obviously is not gonna be 24 hours a day,
*  you have to do other stuff.
*  You have work, you need to sleep.
*  But I think it really gets to kind of
*  how you're using these things.
*  Whereas if what you're primarily using the services for
*  is to you're getting stuck in loops,
*  reading news or something that is really kind of getting you
*  into a negative mental state, then I don't know.
*  I mean, I think that there's probably
*  a relatively short period of time
*  that maybe that's kind of a good thing
*  that you wanna be doing.
*  But again, even then it's not zero, right?
*  Because it's, just because news might make you unhappy
*  doesn't mean that the answer is to be unaware
*  of negative things that are happening in the world.
*  I just think that there's like different people
*  have different tolerances for what they can take on that.
*  And I think we, it's generally having some awareness
*  is probably good as long as it's not more
*  than you're kind of constitutionally able to take.
*  So I don't know, try to not be too paternalistic
*  about this is our approach,
*  but we want to empower people by giving them the tools,
*  both people and if you're a teen, your parents,
*  to have tools to understand what you're experiencing
*  and what the, and how you're using these things
*  and then go from there.
*  Yeah, I think it requires of all of us
*  some degree of self-regulation.
*  I like this idea of not being too paternalistic.
*  I mean, that's, it seems like the right way to go.
*  I find myself occasionally having to make sure
*  that I'm not just passively scrolling, that I'm learning.
*  I like forging for organizing and dispersing information.
*  That's been my life's career.
*  So I've learned so much from social media.
*  I find great papers, great ideas.
*  I think comments are a great source of feedback.
*  And I'm not just saying that cause you're sitting here.
*  I mean, Instagram in particular,
*  but other meta-platforms have been tremendously helpful
*  for me to get science and health information out.
*  One of the things that I'm really excited about,
*  which I only had the chance to try for the first time today
*  is your new VR platforms, the newest Oculus.
*  And when then we can talk about the glasses, the Ray-Bans.
*  Sure.
*  Those are still, those two experiences
*  are still kind of blowing my mind,
*  especially the Ray-Ban glasses.
*  And I have so many questions about this, so I'll resist.
*  But-
*  We can get into that.
*  Okay, well, yeah, I have some experience with VR.
*  My lab has used VR.
*  Jeremy Bailenson's lab at Stanford
*  is one of the pioneering labs of VR and mixed reality.
*  I guess some they used to call it augmented reality,
*  but now mixed reality.
*  I think what's so striking about the VR
*  that you guys had me try today
*  is how well it interfaces with the real room.
*  Let's call it the physical room.
*  I could still see people,
*  I could see where the furniture was,
*  so I wasn't going to bump into anything.
*  I could see people's smiles.
*  I could see my water on the table
*  while I was doing this,
*  what felt like a real martial arts experience,
*  except I wasn't getting hit,
*  well, I was getting hit virtually,
*  but it's extremely engaging.
*  And yet on the good side of things,
*  it really bypasses a lot of the early concerns
*  that Bailenson lab, again, Jeremy's lab was early to say
*  that, oh, there's a limit to how much VR one can
*  or should use each day, even for the adult brain,
*  because it can really disrupt your vestibular system,
*  your sense of balance.
*  All of that seems to have been dealt with
*  in this new iteration of VR.
*  We didn't come out of it feeling dizzy at all.
*  I didn't feel like I was re-entering the room
*  in a way that was really jarring.
*  Going into it is obviously, whoa, this is a different world,
*  but you can look to your left and say,
*  oh, someone just came in the door.
*  Hey, how's it going?
*  Hold on, I'm playing this game just as it was
*  when I was a kid playing in Nintendo
*  and someone would walk in, it's fully engrossing,
*  but you'd be like, hold on and you see they're there.
*  So first of all, bravo, incredible.
*  And then the next question is,
*  what do we even call this experience?
*  Because it is truly mixed.
*  It's a truly mixed reality experience.
*  Yeah, I mean, mixed reality is sort of the umbrella term
*  that refers to the combined experience
*  of virtual and augmented reality.
*  So augmented reality is what you're eventually gonna get
*  with some future version of the smart glasses
*  where you're primarily seeing the world, right,
*  but you can put holograms in it, right?
*  So like that we'll have a future
*  where you're gonna walk into a room
*  and you're gonna be like as many holograms
*  as physical objects, right?
*  If you just think about like all the paper,
*  the kind of art, physical games, media,
*  your workstation.
*  If we refer to, let's say an MMA fight,
*  we could just draw it up on the table right here
*  and just see it repeat as opposed to us turning
*  and looking at a screen.
*  Yeah, I mean, pretty much any screen that exists
*  could be a hologram in the future with smart glasses, right?
*  There's nothing that actually physically needs to be there
*  for that when you have glasses
*  that can put a hologram there.
*  And it's an interesting thought experiment
*  to just go around and think about, okay,
*  what of the things that are physical in the world
*  need to actually be physical?
*  And your chair does, right,
*  because you're sitting on it,
*  a hologram isn't gonna support you,
*  but I like that art on the wall.
*  I mean, that doesn't need to physically be there.
*  I mean, so I think that that's sort of the augmented reality
*  experience that we're moving towards.
*  And then we've had these headsets
*  that historically we think about as VR.
*  And that has been something that kind of,
*  it's like a fully immersive experience,
*  but now we're kind of getting something
*  that's a hybrid in between the two and capable of both,
*  which is a headset that can do both virtual reality
*  and some of these augmented reality experiences.
*  And I think that that's really powerful,
*  both because you're gonna get new applications
*  that kind of allow people to collaborate together.
*  And maybe the two of us are here physically,
*  but someone joins us and it's their avatar there,
*  or maybe it's some version in the future,
*  like you're having a team meeting
*  and you have some people there physically,
*  and you have some people dialing in,
*  and they're basically like a hologram there virtually,
*  but then you also have some AI personas
*  that are on your team that are helping you
*  do different things, and they can be embodied as avatars
*  and around the table meeting with you.
*  So-
*  Are people going to be doing first dates
*  that are physically separated?
*  I could imagine that some people would,
*  is it even worth leaving the house type date?
*  And then they find out and then they meet for the first time.
*  I mean, maybe, I think, you know,
*  dating has physical aspects to it too.
*  So I think that that's-
*  And some people might not be,
*  they wanna know whether or not it's worth the effort
*  to head out to what not.
*  You know, it is possible.
*  Reach the divide, right?
*  It is possible.
*  I mean, I know like some of my friends who are dating
*  basically say that in order to make sure
*  that they have like a safe experience,
*  and if they're going on a first date,
*  they'll schedule something that's like shorter
*  and maybe in the middle of the day,
*  like so maybe it's coffee,
*  so that way if they don't like the person,
*  they can just kind of get out
*  before like going and scheduling a dinner
*  or like a real full date.
*  So I don't know, maybe in the future,
*  people will kind of have that experience
*  where you can feel like you're kind of sitting there
*  and it's even easier and lighter weight and safer.
*  And if you're not having a good experience,
*  you can just like teleport out of there and beyond.
*  But yeah, I think that this will be an interesting question
*  in the future is there are clearly a lot of things
*  that are only possible physically
*  or are so much better physically.
*  And then there are all these things that we're building up
*  that can be digital experiences,
*  but it's this weird artifact
*  of kind of how this stuff has been developed
*  that the digital world and the physical world
*  exist in these like completely different planes.
*  Where you wanna interact with the digital world,
*  well, we do it all the time,
*  but we pull out a small screen or we have a big screen.
*  And it's just basically we're interacting
*  with the digital world through these screens.
*  But I think if we fast forward a decade or more,
*  it's I think one of the really interesting questions
*  about what is the world that we're gonna live in,
*  I think it's gonna increasingly be this mesh
*  of the physical and digital worlds
*  that will allow us to feel A, that the world that we're in
*  is just a lot richer,
*  because there can be all these things that people create
*  that are just so much easier to do digitally
*  than physically.
*  But B, you're gonna have a real kind of physical
*  sense of presence with these things
*  and not feel like interacting in the digital world
*  is taking you away from the physical world,
*  which today is just so much viscerally richer
*  and more powerful.
*  I think the digital world will sort of be embedded
*  in that and we'll feel kind of just as vivid
*  in a lot of ways.
*  So that's why I always think,
*  when you were saying before,
*  you felt like you could look around and see the real room.
*  I actually think that there's an interesting
*  kind of philosophical distinction between the real room
*  and the physical room,
*  which historically I think people would have said
*  those are the same thing.
*  But I actually think in the future,
*  the real room is gonna be the combination
*  of the physical world with all the digital artifacts
*  and objects that are in there
*  that you can interact with them and feel present,
*  whereas the physical world is just the part
*  that's physically there.
*  And I think it's possible to build a real world
*  that's the sum of these two that will actually be
*  more profound experience than what we have today.
*  I was struck by the smoothness of the interface
*  between the VR and the physical room.
*  Your team had me try a,
*  I guess it was an exercise class in the form of a book.
*  It was like, essentially like hitting mitts boxing.
*  So hitting targets boxing.
*  Supernatural.
*  Yeah, and it comes at a fairly fast pace
*  but then picks up, it's got some tutorial,
*  it's very easy to use.
*  And certainly got my heart rate up.
*  I'm in at least decent shape.
*  And I have to be honest,
*  I never once desired to do any of these
*  on-screen fitness things.
*  I mean, I can't think of anything more aversive
*  than like a clap,
*  like I don't wanna insult any particular products,
*  but like riding a stationary bike while looking at a screen
*  and pretending I'm on a road outside,
*  I can't think of anything worse for me.
*  Maybe only-
*  I do like the leaderboard.
*  Okay.
*  You're a very competitive person.
*  It's like, if you're gonna be running on a treadmill,
*  at least give me a leaderboard
*  so I can beat the people who are ahead of me.
*  I like moving outside and certainly an exercise class
*  or aerobics class as they used to call them.
*  But the experience I tried today was extremely engaging.
*  And I've done enough boxing to at least know
*  how to do a little bit of it.
*  And I really enjoyed it.
*  Gets your heart rate up.
*  And I completely forgot that I was doing
*  an on-screen experience because in part,
*  because I believe I was still in that physical room.
*  And I think there's something about the mesh
*  of the physical room and the virtual experience
*  that makes it neither of one world or the other.
*  I mean, I really felt at the interface of those
*  and certainly got presence,
*  this feeling of forgetting that I was in a virtual experience
*  and got my heart rate up pretty quickly.
*  We had to stop because we were gonna start recording,
*  but I would do that for a good 45 minutes in the morning.
*  Yeah.
*  There's no amount of money you could pay me truly
*  to look at a screen while pedaling on a bike
*  or running on a treadmill.
*  So again, bravo.
*  I think it's gonna be very useful.
*  It's going to get people moving their bodies more,
*  which certainly social media up until now
*  and a lot of technologies have been accused
*  of limiting the amount of physical activity
*  that both children and adults are engaged in.
*  And we know we need physical activity.
*  You're a big proponent of and practitioner
*  of physical activity.
*  So is this a major goal of Meta?
*  Get people moving their bodies more
*  and getting their heart rates up and so on?
*  I think we want to enable it and I think it's good,
*  but I think it comes more from
*  like a philosophical view of the world
*  than it is necessarily.
*  I mean, I don't go into building products
*  to try to shape people's behavior, right?
*  I believe in empowering people to do what they want
*  and be the best version of themselves that they can be.
*  So no agenda.
*  That said, I do believe that
*  I think there's the previous generation of computers
*  were devices for your mind.
*  And I think that we are not brains in tanks.
*  It's like I think that there's sort of a philosophical view
*  of people of like, okay, you are primarily
*  what you think about or your values or something.
*  It's like, no, you are that
*  and you are a physical manifestation.
*  And people were very physical.
*  And I think building a computer for your whole body
*  and not just for your mind
*  is very fitting with this worldview
*  that like the actual essence of you,
*  if you want to be present with another person,
*  if you want to like be fully engaged in experience
*  is not just, okay, it's not just a video conference call
*  that looks at your face and where you can like share ideas.
*  It's something that you can engage your whole body.
*  So yeah, I mean, I think being physical
*  is very important to me.
*  I mean, it's just that's a lot of
*  the most fun stuff that I get to do.
*  It's a really important part of how I personally balance
*  my energy levels and just get a diversity of experiences
*  because I could spend all my time running the company.
*  But I think it's good for people to do some different things
*  and compete in different areas or learn different things.
*  And all of that is good.
*  If people wanna do really intense workouts
*  with the work that we're doing with Quest
*  or with eventually our glasses, great.
*  But even if you don't wanna do like a really intense workout,
*  I think just having a computing environment and platform
*  which is inherently physical captures more of the essence
*  of what we are as people than any of the previous
*  computing platforms that we've had to date.
*  Yeah, I was even thinking just of the simple task
*  of getting a better range of motion, AKA flexibility.
*  I could imagine inside of the VR experience,
*  leaning into a stretch, a standard kind of like
*  like a lunge type stretch, but actually seeing a meter
*  of like, are you approaching new levels of flexibility
*  in that moment?
*  Or it's actually measuring some kinesthetic elements
*  on the body and the joints.
*  And I mean, I was just trying, whereas normally
*  you might have to do that in front of a camera
*  which then would give you the data on a screen
*  that you'd look at afterwards or hire an expensive coach
*  but so, or looking at form and resistance training.
*  So you're actually lifting physical weights
*  but it's telling you whether or not you're breaking form.
*  I mean, there's just so much that could be done
*  inside of there.
*  And then my mind just starts to spiral into like,
*  wow, this is very likely to transform what we think of
*  as quote unquote exercise.
*  Yeah, I think so.
*  I mean, there's still a bunch of questions
*  that need to get answered.
*  You know, I don't think most people are gonna necessarily
*  want to install, you know, a lot of sensors or cameras
*  to track their whole body.
*  So we're just over time getting better from the sensors
*  that are on the headsets of being able to do very good
*  hand tracking, right?
*  So we have this research demo where you now,
*  just with the hand tracking from the headset, you can type.
*  It just projects a little keyboard onto your table
*  and you can type and people like type like 100 words
*  a minute with that.
*  With a virtual keyboard.
*  Yeah, we're starting to be able to using some modern
*  AI techniques, be able to like simulate and understand
*  where your torso's position is.
*  Even though you can't always see it,
*  you can see it a bunch of the time.
*  And if you fuse together what you do see with like
*  the accelerometer and understanding how the thing is moving,
*  you can kind of understand what the body position
*  is gonna be.
*  But some things are still gonna be hard, right?
*  So you mentioned boxing.
*  That one works pretty well because we understand
*  your head position, we understand your hands.
*  And now we're kind of increasingly understanding
*  your body position.
*  But let's say you wanna expand that to Muay Thai
*  or kickboxing.
*  Okay, so legs, that's a different part of tracking.
*  That's harder, because that's out of the field of view
*  more of the time.
*  But there's also the element of resistance, right?
*  So you can throw a punch and retract it in shadow box
*  and do that without upsetting your kind of physical balance
*  that much.
*  But if you wanna throw a roundhouse kick
*  and there's no one there, then I mean,
*  the standard way that you do it when you're shadow boxing
*  is you basically do a little 360.
*  But like, I don't know, is that gonna feel great?
*  I mean, I think there's a question about
*  what that experience should be.
*  And then if you want to go even further,
*  if you want to get like grappling to work,
*  I'm not even sure how you would do that
*  without having resistance of understanding
*  what the forces applied to you would be.
*  And this then you get into, okay,
*  maybe you're gonna have some kind of body suit
*  that can apply haptics.
*  But I'm not even sure that even a pretty advanced
*  haptic system is gonna be able to be quite good enough
*  to do to simulate like the actual forces
*  that would be applied to you in a grappling scenario.
*  So this is part of what's fun about technology though,
*  is you keep on getting new capabilities
*  and then you need to figure out
*  what things you can do with them.
*  So I think it's really neat that we can kind of do boxing
*  and we can do the supernatural thing.
*  And there's a bunch of awesome cardio and dancing
*  and things like that.
*  And then there's also still so much more to do
*  that I'm excited to kind of get to over time.
*  But it's a long journey.
*  And what about things like painting and art and music?
*  You know, I imagine, you know, of course,
*  like different mediums,
*  like I like to draw with pen and pencil,
*  but I could imagine trying to learn how to paint virtually.
*  And of course you could print out a physical version
*  of that at the end.
*  This doesn't have to depart from the physical world.
*  It could end in the physical world.
*  Did you see the demo, the piano demo where you,
*  either you're there with a physical keyboard
*  or it could be a virtual keyboard,
*  but the app basically highlights what keys you need to press
*  in order to play the song.
*  So it's basically like you're looking at your piano
*  and it's teaching you how to play a song that you choose.
*  An actual piano.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  But it's illuminating certain keys in the virtual space.
*  And it could either be a virtual piano if you,
*  or keyboard, if you don't have a piano or keyboard,
*  or it could use your actual keyboard.
*  So yeah, I think stuff like that is gonna be
*  really fascinating for education and expression.
*  And for broadening access to expensive equipment.
*  I mean, piano is no small expense.
*  Exactly.
*  And it takes up a lot of space and it needs to be tuned.
*  You can think of all these things like the kid
*  that has very little income or their family
*  has very little income could learn to play a virtual piano
*  at much lower cost.
*  Yeah, it gets back to the question I was asking before
*  about this thought experiment of how many of the things
*  that we physically have today actually need to be physical.
*  The piano doesn't.
*  Maybe there's some premium where it's,
*  maybe it's a somewhat better, more tactile experience
*  to have a physical one.
*  But for people who don't have the space for it
*  or who can't afford to buy a piano
*  or just aren't sure that they would wanna make
*  that investment at the beginning of learning
*  how to play piano, I think in the future,
*  you'll have the option of just buying an app
*  or a hologram piano, which will be a lot more affordable.
*  And I think it's gonna be, that's gonna be,
*  unlock a ton of creativity too,
*  because instead of the market for piano makers
*  being constrained to a relatively small set of experts
*  who have perfected that craft,
*  then you're gonna have kids or developers
*  all around the world designing crazy designs
*  for potential keyboards and pianos
*  that look nothing like what we've seen before
*  but are maybe bring even more joy
*  and are even more fun in the world
*  where you have fewer of these physical constraints.
*  So I don't know, I think it's gonna,
*  there's gonna be a lot of wild stuff to explore.
*  There's definitely gonna be a lot of wild stuff to explore.
*  I was just had this idea slash image in my mind
*  of what you were talking about merged
*  with our earlier conversation when Priscilla was here,
*  I could imagine a time not too long from now
*  where you're using mixed reality to run experiments
*  in the lab, literally mixing virtual solutions,
*  getting potential outcomes, and then picking the best one
*  to then go actually do in the real world,
*  which is very both financially costly
*  and time-wise costly.
*  Yeah, I mean, people are already using VR
*  for surgery and education on it.
*  And there's some study that was done that
*  basically tried to do a controlled experiment
*  of people who learned how to do a specific surgery
*  through just a normal kind of textbook and lecture method
*  versus like you show the knee and you have it
*  be a large blown up model and people can manipulate it
*  and kind of practice where they would make the cuts
*  and like the people in that class did better.
*  So I think that there's, yeah,
*  I think that it's gonna be profound
*  for a lot of different areas.
*  And the last example that leaps to mind,
*  I think social media and online culture
*  has been accused of creating a lot of real world,
*  let's call it physical world social anxiety for people,
*  but I could imagine I'm practicing a social interaction
*  or a kid that has a lot of social anxiety
*  or that needs to advocate for themselves better,
*  learning how to do that progressively
*  through a virtual interaction
*  and then taking that to the real world
*  because it's in my very recent experience today,
*  it's so blended now with real experience
*  that the kid that feels terrified
*  of advocating for themselves
*  or just talking to another human being or an adult
*  or being in a new circumstance of a room full of kids,
*  you could really experience that in silico first
*  and get comfortable,
*  let the nervous system attenuate a bit
*  and then take it into the quote unquote physical world.
*  Yeah, I think we'll see experiences like that.
*  I mean, I also think that some of the social dynamics
*  around how people interact
*  in this kind of blended digital world
*  will be more nuanced in other ways.
*  So I'm sure that there will be kind of new anxieties
*  that people develop too,
*  just like teens today need to navigate dynamics
*  around texting constantly
*  that we just didn't have when we were kids.
*  So I think it will help with some things.
*  I think that there will be new issues
*  that hopefully we can help people work through too.
*  But overall, I think, yeah, no,
*  I think it's gonna be really powerful and positive.
*  Let's talk about the glasses.
*  Sure.
*  This was wild.
*  Yeah.
*  I put on a pair of Ray-Bans.
*  I like the way they look.
*  They're clear.
*  They look like any other Ray-Ban glasses
*  except that I could call out to the glasses.
*  I could just say, you know,
*  hey, Meta, I want to listen to the Bach variations,
*  the Goldberg variations of Bach.
*  And Meta responded and no one around me could hear,
*  but I could hear with exquisite clarity.
*  By the way, I'm not getting paid to say any of this.
*  I'm just still blown away by this, folks.
*  I want a pair of these very badly.
*  I could hear, okay, I'm selecting those now
*  and that music now.
*  And then I could hear it in the background,
*  but then I could still have a conversation.
*  So this was neither headphones in or headphones out.
*  And I could say, wait, pause the music and it would pause.
*  And the best part was I didn't have to
*  leave the room mentally.
*  I didn't even have to take out a phone.
*  It was all interfaced through this very local environment
*  in and around the head.
*  And as a neuroscientist, I'm fascinated by this
*  because of course all of our perceptions,
*  auditory, visual, et cetera,
*  all occurring inside the casing of this thing
*  we call a skull.
*  But maybe you could comment on the origin of that design
*  for you, the ideas behind that
*  and where you think it could go
*  because I'm sure I'm just scratching the surface.
*  The real product that we want to eventually get to
*  is this kind of full augmented reality product
*  in a kind of stylish and comfortable
*  normal glasses form factor.
*  Not dorky VR headset, so to speak.
*  No, I mean- Because the VR headset
*  does feel kind of like- It will, but-
*  Like thing on the face.
*  There's going to be a place for that too,
*  just like you have your laptop
*  and you have your workstation.
*  Or maybe the better analogy is you have your phone
*  and you have your workstation.
*  These AR glasses are going to be like your phone
*  in that you have something on your face
*  and you will, I think, be able to, if you want,
*  wear it for a lot of the day
*  and interact with it very frequently.
*  I don't think that people are going to be
*  walking around the world wearing VR headsets.
*  Let's hope not.
*  But yeah, that's certainly not the future
*  that I'm kind of hoping we get to.
*  But I do think that there is a place where,
*  because it's a bigger form factor,
*  it has more compute power.
*  So just like your workstation or your kind of
*  bigger computer can do more than your phone can do,
*  there's a place for that.
*  When you want to settle into an intense task,
*  if you have a doctor who's doing a surgery,
*  I would want them doing it through the headset,
*  not through their phone equivalent
*  or the just kind of lower powered glasses.
*  But just like phones are powerful enough
*  to do a lot of things,
*  and the glasses will eventually get there too.
*  Now that said, there's a bunch of really hard
*  technology problems to address
*  in order to be able to get to this point
*  where you can put kind of full holograms in the world.
*  You're basically miniaturizing a supercomputer
*  and putting it into a pair of glasses
*  so that the pair of glasses still look stylish and normal.
*  And that's a really hard technology problem.
*  Making things small is really hard.
*  A holographic display is,
*  it's different from what our industry has optimized for
*  for 30 or 40 years now, building screens.
*  There's like a whole kind of industrial process around
*  that goes into phones and TVs and computers
*  and like increasingly so many things
*  that have different screens.
*  Like there's a whole pipeline that's gotten very good
*  at making that kind of screen.
*  And the holographic displays
*  are just a completely different thing, right?
*  Cause it's not a screen, right?
*  It's a thing that you can shoot light into through a laser
*  or some other kind of projector
*  and it can place that as an object in the world.
*  So that's gonna need to be this whole other
*  industrial process that gets built up
*  to doing that like in an efficient way.
*  So all that said,
*  we're basically taking two different approaches
*  towards building this at once.
*  One is we are trying to keep in mind
*  what is the long-term thing that,
*  it's not super far off.
*  I think within a few years,
*  I think we'll have something that's sort of a first version
*  of kind of this full vision that I'm talking about.
*  And we have something that's working internally
*  that we use as like a, that we'll use as a dev kit.
*  But that one, that's kind of a big challenge.
*  It's gonna be more expensive.
*  And it's harder to get all the pieces working.
*  The other approach has been, all right,
*  let's start with what we know we can put into
*  a pair of stylish sunglasses today
*  and just make them as smart as we can.
*  So, for the first version, we worked with,
*  we did this collaboration with Ray-Ban, right?
*  Cause that's like well accepted,
*  these are well designed glasses, they're classic.
*  People have used them for decades.
*  For the first version, we got a sensor on the front
*  so you could capture moments
*  without having to take your phone out of your pocket.
*  So you got photos and videos.
*  You had the speaker and the microphone
*  so you can listen to music.
*  You could communicate with it.
*  But it was, that was sort of the first version of it.
*  We had a lot of the basics there,
*  but we saw how people used it and we tuned it.
*  We made the camera is like twice as good
*  for this new version that we made.
*  The audio is a lot crisper for the use cases
*  that we saw that people actually used,
*  which is some of it is listening to music,
*  but a lot of it is like people wanna take calls
*  on their glasses.
*  They wanna listen to podcasts, right?
*  But the biggest thing that I think is interesting
*  is the ability to get AI running on it,
*  which it doesn't just run on the glasses,
*  it also, it kind of proxies through your phone.
*  But I mean, with all the advances in LLMs,
*  we talked about this a bit in the first part
*  of the conversation.
*  Having the ability to have your meta AI assistant
*  that you can just talk to
*  and basically ask any question throughout the day
*  is, I think it'd be really fascinating.
*  And like you were saying about kind of how we process
*  the world as people, eventually,
*  I think you're gonna want your AI assistant
*  to be able to see what you see and hear what you hear.
*  Maybe not all the time,
*  but you're gonna wanna be able to tell it
*  to go into a mode where it can see what you see
*  and hear what you hear.
*  And what's the kind of device design
*  that best kind of positions an AI assistant
*  to be able to see what you see and hear what you hear
*  so it can best help you?
*  Well, that's glasses, right?
*  Where it basically has a sensor to be able to see
*  what you see and a microphone that is close to your ears
*  that can hear what you hear.
*  The other design goals is, like you said,
*  to keep you present in the world, right?
*  So I think one of the issues with phones
*  is they kind of pull you away
*  from what's physically happening around you.
*  And I don't think that the next generation
*  of computing will do that.
*  I just, I'm chuckling to myself because I have a friend,
*  he's a very well-known photographer,
*  and he was laughing about how people go to a concert
*  and everyone's filming the concert on their phone
*  so that they can be the person that posts the thing.
*  But like there are literally millions of other people
*  who posted the exact same thing,
*  but somehow our unique experience,
*  it feels important to post our unique experience
*  with glasses that would essentially smooth that gap
*  completely.
*  Yeah, totally.
*  You could just worry about it later, download it.
*  There are issues I realize with glasses
*  because they are so seamless with everyday experience,
*  even though you and I aren't wearing them now.
*  It's very common for people to wear glasses.
*  Issues of recording and consent.
*  Yeah, that's what we have.
*  Like if I go into a locker room at my gym.
*  That's where we have the light on.
*  I'm assuming that the people with glasses aren't filming.
*  Whereas when, right now,
*  because there's a sharp transition
*  when there's a phone in the room and someone's pointing it,
*  people generally say no phones in locker rooms are recording.
*  So that's just one instance.
*  I mean there are other instances.
*  But we have the whole privacy light.
*  I don't know, did you get a chance to explore that?
*  Yeah, so anytime that it's active,
*  that the camera sensor is active,
*  it's basically like pulsing a white, bright light.
*  Got it.
*  Which is, by the way, more than cameras do.
*  Right, someone's holding a phone in his eye.
*  Phones aren't kind of showing a light,
*  a bright sensor when you're taking a photo.
*  No, people oftentimes will pretend they're texting
*  and they're actually recording.
*  I actually saw an instance of this in a barbershop once
*  where someone was recording
*  and they were pretending that they were texting.
*  And there was a pretty intense interaction that ensued.
*  And it was like, wow, you know,
*  it's pretty easy for people to feign texting
*  while actually recording.
*  Yeah, so I think when you're evaluating a risk
*  with a new technology, the bar shouldn't be,
*  is it possible to do anything bad?
*  It's does this new technology make it easier
*  to do something bad than what people already had?
*  And I think because you have this privacy light
*  that is just broadcasting to everyone around you,
*  hey, this thing is recording now,
*  I think that that makes it actually less discreet
*  to do it through the glasses
*  than what you could do with a phone already,
*  which I think is basically the bar
*  that we wanted to get over from a design perspective.
*  Thank you for pointing out that it has the privacy light.
*  I didn't get long enough in the experience
*  to explore all the features.
*  But again, I can think of a lot of uses,
*  being able to look at a restaurant from the outside
*  and see the menu, get status on how crowded it is,
*  as much as I love, I don't want to call out.
*  Let's just say app-based map functions
*  that allow you to navigate and the audio is okay.
*  It's nice to have a conversation with somebody on the phone
*  or in the vehicle and just it'd be great
*  if the road was traced where I should turn.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  These kinds of things seem like it's going to be
*  straightforward for a meta engineer to create.
*  Some future version will have it
*  so it also have the holographic display
*  where it can show you the directions.
*  But I think that there will basically just be
*  different price points that pack
*  different amounts of technology.
*  The holographic display part I think is going to be
*  more expensive than doing one that just has the AI
*  but is primarily communicating with you through audio.
*  So I mean, the current Ray-Ban Metaglasses are 299.
*  I think when we have one that has a display in it,
*  it'll probably be some amount more than that,
*  but it'll also be more powerful.
*  So I think that people choose what they want to use
*  based on what the capabilities are that they want
*  and what they can afford.
*  But a lot of our goal in building things is,
*  we try to make things that can be accessible to everyone.
*  Our game as a company isn't to build things
*  and then charge a premium price for it.
*  We try to build things that then everyone can use
*  and then become more useful
*  because a very large number of people are using them.
*  So it's just a very different approach.
*  We're not like Apple or some of these companies
*  that just try to make something
*  and then sell it for as much as they can,
*  which I mean, they're a great company.
*  So I mean, I think that that model kind of is fine too.
*  But our approach is going to be,
*  we want stuff that can be affordable
*  so that way everyone in the world can use it.
*  Long lines of health, I think the glasses will also
*  potentially solve a major problem in a real way,
*  which is the following for both children and adults.
*  It's very clear that viewing objects in particular screens
*  up close for too many hours per day leads to myopia.
*  Literally a change in the length of the eyeball
*  and near sightedness.
*  And on the positive side,
*  we know based on some really large clinical trials
*  that kids who spend and adults who spend two hours a day
*  or more out of doors don't experience that
*  and maybe even reverse their myopia.
*  And it has something to do with exposure to sunlight,
*  but it has a lot to do with long viewing,
*  viewing things at a distance greater
*  than three or four feet away.
*  And with the glasses, I realize one could actually
*  do digital work out of doors.
*  It could measure and tell you how much time you've spent
*  looking at things up close versus far away.
*  I mean, this is just another example that leaps to mind,
*  but in accessing the visual system,
*  you're effectively accessing the whole brain
*  because it's the only two bits of brain
*  that are outside the cranial vault.
*  So it just seems like putting technology
*  right at the level of the eyes,
*  seeing what the eyes see
*  is just gotta be the best way to go.
*  Yeah, I think, well, multimodal, right, I think is,
*  you want the visual sensation,
*  but you also want kind of text or language.
*  So I think it's-
*  But that all can be brought to the level of the eyes, right?
*  What do you mean by that?
*  Well, I mean, I think what we're describing here
*  is essentially taking the phone, the computer,
*  and bringing it all to the level of the eyes.
*  And of course, one would like more-
*  Physically at your face.
*  Physically at your eyes, right?
*  And one would like more kinesthetic information
*  as you mentioned before, where the legs are,
*  maybe even lung function.
*  Hey, have you taken enough steps today?
*  But that all can be, if it can be figured out on the phone,
*  it can be by the phone, it can be figured out by glasses.
*  But there's additional information there,
*  such as what are you focusing on in your world?
*  How much of your time is spent
*  looking at things far away versus up close?
*  How much social time did you have today?
*  It's really tricky to get that with a phone.
*  Like, if my phone were right in front of us
*  as if we were at a standard lunch nowadays,
*  certainly Silicon Valley,
*  and then we're peering at our phones,
*  I mean, how much real direct attention
*  was in the conversation at hand versus something else?
*  I mean, you can get issues of where are you
*  placing your attention
*  by virtue of where you're placing your eyes.
*  And I think that information is not accessible
*  with a phone in your pocket or in front of you.
*  I mean, a little bit, but not nearly as rich
*  and complete information as one gets
*  when you're really pulling the data from the level of vision
*  what kids and adults are actually looking at
*  and attending to.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, I agree.
*  So it seems extremely valuable.
*  You get autonomic information, size of the pupils.
*  So you get information about internal states.
*  I mean, that you can't-
*  There's internal sensor and outside.
*  So there's the sensor on the Ray-Ban Metaglasses
*  is external, right?
*  So it's basically allows you to see what you see.
*  Then, sorry, the AI assistant to see what you're seeing.
*  There's a separate set of things which are eye tracking.
*  Which are also very powerful
*  for enabling a lot of interfaces, right?
*  So if you wanna just like look at something
*  and select it by looking at it with your eyes
*  rather than having to kind of drag a controller over
*  or pick up a hologram or anything like that,
*  you can do that with eye tracking.
*  So that's a pretty profound and cool experience too
*  as well as just kind of understanding
*  what you're looking at so that way you're not
*  kind of wasting compute power drawing pixels
*  in high resolution in a part of the kind of world
*  that's gonna be in your peripheral vision.
*  So yeah, all of these things,
*  there are interesting design and technology trade-offs
*  where if you want the external sensor, that's one thing.
*  If you also want the eye tracking,
*  now that's a different set of sensors.
*  Each one of these consumes compute, which consumes battery.
*  They take up more space, right?
*  So it's like, where are the eye tracking sensors gonna be?
*  It's like what you wanna make sure
*  that the rim of the glasses is actually quite thin
*  because I mean, there's a kind of variance
*  of how thick can glasses be
*  before they look more like goggles than glasses.
*  The thing that this is, there's this whole space
*  and I think people are gonna end up choosing
*  what product makes sense for them.
*  Maybe they want something that's more powerful
*  that is more of the sensors,
*  but it's gonna be a little more expensive,
*  maybe like slightly thicker,
*  or maybe you want like a more basic thing
*  that just looks like very similar
*  to what Ray-Ban glasses are
*  that people have been wearing for decades,
*  but kind of has AI in it and you can capture moments
*  without having to take your phone out
*  and send them to people.
*  In the latest version, we got the ability into live stream.
*  I think that that's pretty crazy
*  that now you can be kind of going back to your concert case
*  or whatever else you're doing.
*  You can be doing sports
*  and just watching your kids play something
*  and just you can be watching
*  and you can be live streaming it
*  to your kind of family group so people can see it.
*  I think that stuff is, I think that's pretty cool
*  that you basically have a normal looking pair of glasses
*  at this point that can kind of live stream
*  and has like an AI assistant.
*  So the stuff is making a lot faster progress
*  in a lot of ways than I would have thought.
*  And I don't know, I think people are gonna like this version
*  but there's a lot more still to do.
*  I think it's super exciting and I see a lot of technologies.
*  This one's particularly exciting to me
*  because of how smooth the interface is
*  and for all the reasons that you just mentioned.
*  What's happening with and what can we expect
*  around AI interfaces and maybe even avatars
*  of people within social media?
*  Are we not far off from a day
*  where there are multiple versions of me
*  and you on the internet where people, for instance,
*  I get asked a lot of questions.
*  I don't have the opportunity to respond
*  to all those questions but with things like chat GPT,
*  people are trying to generate answers to those questions
*  on other platforms.
*  Will I have the opportunity to soon have an AI version
*  of myself where people can ask me questions
*  about like what I recommend for sleep and circadian rhythm,
*  fitness, mental health, et cetera,
*  based on content I've already generated
*  that will be accurate so they could just ask my avatar.
*  Yeah, this is something that I think a lot of creators
*  are gonna want that we're trying to build
*  and I think we'll probably have a version of next year
*  but there's a bunch of constraints
*  that I think we need to make sure that we get right.
*  So for one, I think it's really important
*  that it's not that there's a bunch of versions of you,
*  it's that if anyone is creating
*  like an AI assistant version of you,
*  it should be something that you control.
*  I think there are some platforms that are out there today
*  that just let people like make, I don't know,
*  that AI bot of me or other figures and it's like,
*  I don't know, I mean, we have platform policies
*  for decades since the beginning of the company at this point,
*  which is almost 20 years,
*  that basically don't allow impersonation.
*  Real identity is like one of the core aspects
*  that kind of our company was started on
*  is like you wanna authentically be yourself.
*  So yeah, I think if you're almost any creator,
*  being able to engage your community
*  and there's just gonna be more demand to interact with you
*  than you have hours in the day.
*  So there are both people out there who would benefit
*  from being able to talk to an AI version of you
*  and I think you and other creators would benefit
*  from being able to keep your community engaged
*  and service that demand that people have to engage with you.
*  But you're gonna wanna know that that AI kind of version
*  of you or assistant is gonna represent you
*  the way that you would want.
*  And there are a lot of things that are awesome
*  about kind of these modern LLMs,
*  but having perfect predictability about how it's gonna
*  represent something is not one of the current strengths.
*  So I think that there's some work
*  that needs to get done there.
*  I don't think it needs to be 100% perfect all the time,
*  but you need to have very good confidence, I would say,
*  that it's gonna represent you the way that you'd want
*  for you to wanna turn it on, which again,
*  you should have control over whether you turn it on.
*  So we wanted to start in a different place,
*  which I think is a somewhat easier problem,
*  which is creating new characters for AI persona.
*  So that way it's not, we built,
*  one of the AIs is like a chef,
*  and they can help you kind of come up with things
*  that you could cook and can help you cook them.
*  There's like a couple of people that are interested
*  in different types of fitness that can help you
*  kind of plan out your workouts or help with recovery
*  or different things like that.
*  There are people, there's an AI that's focused
*  on like DIY crafts.
*  There's somebody who's a travel expert
*  that can help you make travel plans
*  or give you ideas.
*  But the key thing about all these is they're not modeled
*  off of existing people, so they don't have to have
*  kind of 100% fidelity to like making sure
*  that they never say something that a real person
*  who they're modeled after would never say
*  because they're just made up characters.
*  So I think that that is, that's a somewhat easier problem.
*  We actually got a bunch of different kind of well-known people
*  to play those characters because we thought
*  that would make it more fun.
*  So there's like Snoop Dogg is the dungeon master.
*  So you can like drop him into a thread
*  and play text-based games.
*  And it's just like, I do this with my daughter
*  when I tuck her in at night, and she just like loves
*  storytelling, right?
*  And it's like Snoop Dogg is the dungeon master,
*  will come up with like, here's what's happening next.
*  And she's like, okay, I like turn into a mermaid.
*  And then I like swim across the bay
*  and I go and find the treasure chest and unlock it.
*  And then Snoop Dogg just always will have a next version
*  of the, like the next iteration on the story.
*  So I mean, it's stuff is fun,
*  but it's not actually Snoop Dogg.
*  He's just kind of the actor.
*  He's playing the dungeon master, which makes it more fun.
*  So I think that that's probably the right place to start
*  is you have like, you can kind of build versions
*  of these characters that people can interact
*  with doing different things.
*  But I think where you wanna get over time
*  is to the place where any creator or any small business
*  can very easily just create an AI assistant
*  that can represent them and interact
*  with your kind of community or customers,
*  if you're a business,
*  and basically just help you grow your enterprise.
*  So I don't know, I think that's gonna be cool,
*  but I think this is, it's a long-term project.
*  I think we'll have more progress on it
*  to report on next year, but I think that's coming.
*  I'm super excited about, because you know,
*  we hear a lot about the downsides of AI.
*  I mean, I think people are now coming around
*  to the reality that AI is neither good nor bad.
*  It can be used for good or bad,
*  and that there are a lot of life enhancing spaces
*  that it's gonna show up and really improve
*  the way that we engage socially, what we learn,
*  and that mental health and physical health
*  don't have to suffer and in fact can be enhanced
*  by the sorts of technologies we've been talking about.
*  So I know you're extremely busy.
*  I so appreciate the large amount of time
*  you've given me today to sort through all these things.
*  That's been fun.
*  And to talk with you and Priscilla
*  and to hear what's happening and where things are headed.
*  The future certainly is bright.
*  I share in your optimism and it's been only strengthened
*  by today's conversation.
*  So thank you so much and keep doing what you're doing.
*  And on behalf of myself and everyone listening,
*  thank you because regardless of what people say,
*  we all use these platforms excitedly.
*  And it's clear that there's a ton of intention and care

*  And that's really worth highlighting.
