# Maximize Productivity, Physical & Mental Health With Daily Tools | Huberman Lab Essentials
**Andrew Huberman:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw)
*  Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=0.0s)]
*  where we revisit past episodes [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=2.44s)]
*  for the most potent and actionable science-based tools [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=4.48s)]
*  for mental health, physical health, and performance. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=7.66s)]
*  I'm Andrew Huberman, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=11.88s)]
*  and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=13.08s)]
*  at Stanford School of Medicine. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=15.76s)]
*  I decided that we would hold office hours. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=17.84s)]
*  Office hours in the university setting [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=20.68s)]
*  are when students come to the professor's office, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=22.52s)]
*  or you meet outdoors on campus or in the classroom [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=25.32s)]
*  to review the material and questions from lecture [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=28.96s)]
*  in more detail. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=31.98s)]
*  Now, unfortunately, we don't have the opportunity [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=33.86s)]
*  to meet face-to-face in real life, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=35.82s)]
*  but nonetheless, you've been sending your questions, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=38.7s)]
*  putting them in the comment section on YouTube, et cetera, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=41.78s)]
*  and I've prepared a number of answers to the questions [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=45.34s)]
*  that have shown up most frequently. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=47.7s)]
*  Now, in order to provide context and structure [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=50.08s)]
*  to the way that we will address these questions, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=53.46s)]
*  I've arranged the science and science-based protocols [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=56.74s)]
*  that relate to various aspects of life, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=60.52s)]
*  such as mood, exercise, sleep, waking, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=62.88s)]
*  anxiety, creativity, et cetera, into the context of a day. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=65.8s)]
*  Selecting the unit of a day [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=70.82000000000001s)]
*  in order to deliver this science information and protocols [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=73.04s)]
*  is not a haphazard decision on my part. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  It's actually the case that every cell in our body, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=79.66s)]
*  every organ in our body and our brain is modulated [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  or changes across the 24-hour day [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=85.36s)]
*  in a very regular and predictable rhythm. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=87.92s)]
*  And so selecting the unit of the day [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=91.24s)]
*  is not just a practical one, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=93.36s)]
*  but it's one that's related to our deeper biology. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=94.8s)]
*  So let's talk about how to apply [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=98.0s)]
*  quality peer-reviewed science to your day [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=99.28s)]
*  and how to optimize everything from sleep to learning, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=101.8s)]
*  creativity, meal timing, et cetera. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=105.16s)]
*  I'm going to do this in the context of my day [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=107.88s)]
*  and what I typically do. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=110.32s)]
*  I tend to wake up sometime around 6 a.m., 6.30. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=111.88s)]
*  The first thing I do after I wake up [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=114.96s)]
*  is I take the pen that's on my nightstand [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=117.19999999999999s)]
*  and the pad of paper on my nightstand [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  and I write down the time in which I woke up. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=121.58s)]
*  The reason for writing down what time I wake up [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=124.96s)]
*  is because I want to know [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=128.14s)]
*  what's called my temperature minimum. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=129.64s)]
*  I don't care what my actual temperature is. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=131.64s)]
*  I care when my lowest temperature is. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=134.51999999999998s)]
*  And I know that that lowest temperature [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  is approximately two hours before my average wake-up time. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  The second thing I do after I wake up [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=143.86s)]
*  is to get into forward ambulation, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=145.86s)]
*  which is just nerd speak for taking a walk. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=148.38000000000002s)]
*  There's a phenomenon whereby [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=151.34s)]
*  when we generate our own forward motion, forward ambulation, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=153.10000000000002s)]
*  visual images pass by us on our eyes, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=158.02s)]
*  so-called optic flow. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=161.26000000000002s)]
*  Experiencing visual flow [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=162.86s)]
*  has a powerful effect on the nervous system. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=165.62s)]
*  The effect it has is essentially to quiet [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=169.28000000000003s)]
*  or reduce the amount of neural activity [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=172.34s)]
*  in this brain structure called the amygdala. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=174.66s)]
*  And many of you have probably heard about the amygdala [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=177.3s)]
*  for its role in anxiety and fear and threat detection. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=180.08s)]
*  And indeed, the amygdala is part of the network [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=183.62s)]
*  in the brain that generates feelings of fear [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=186.82s)]
*  and threat and anxiety. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=189.46s)]
*  It does a bunch of other things too, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=190.62s)]
*  but that's one of its primary functions. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=191.86s)]
*  Forward ambulation, walking or biking or running [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=193.98000000000002s)]
*  and generating optic flow in particular [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=197.46s)]
*  has this incredible property of lowering activity [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=200.32s)]
*  in the amygdala and thereby reducing levels of anxiety. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=203.42s)]
*  That walk is a particularly important protocol each day [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=206.7s)]
*  because it really serves to push my neurology [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=209.7s)]
*  in the direction that I'd like it to go, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=213.38s)]
*  which is alert, but not anxious. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=215.0s)]
*  I want to have a high degree of focus and alertness [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=217.76s)]
*  because I'm soon going to move into about of work. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  I need to lean into the day. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=223.84s)]
*  So in order to do that, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=225.72s)]
*  I make sure that the walking is done outdoors. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=228.18s)]
*  I do it outdoors because I also want sunlight in my eyes. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=231.66s)]
*  Getting sunlight in your eyes first thing in the morning [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=234.78s)]
*  is absolutely vital to mental and physical health. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=237.66s)]
*  Even if there's cloud cover, more photons, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=240.82s)]
*  light information are coming through that cloud cover [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=243.42s)]
*  than would be coming from a very bright indoor bulb. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=245.46s)]
*  So getting outside for a 10 minute walk or a 15 minute walk [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=248.74s)]
*  will basically ensure that you're getting [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=252.22s)]
*  adequate stimulation of these neurons in the eye [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=254.54s)]
*  that are called the melanopsin, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=256.7s)]
*  intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=258.09999999999997s)]
*  These are neurons that convey to the brain [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=260.24s)]
*  that it's daytime and it's time to be alert. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=262.92s)]
*  And it sets in motion a huge number of biological cascades [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=265.3s)]
*  within every cell and organ of your body, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=269.42s)]
*  from your liver to your gut, to your heart, to your brain. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=271.9s)]
*  Early in the day, we experience a natural and healthy bump [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=274.53999999999996s)]
*  in a hormone called cortisol and promotes wakefulness. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=278.86s)]
*  It actually promotes a healthy immune system. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=282.28s)]
*  It's very important that that pulse of cortisol [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=285.22s)]
*  arrive early in the day. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=287.98s)]
*  That pulse of cortisol is going to happen [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=290.34000000000003s)]
*  once every 24 hours, no matter what. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  It's going to happen and you get to time it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=295.18s)]
*  How do you time it? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=297.1s)]
*  Primarily by when you view bright sunlight. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=298.26000000000005s)]
*  You can combine it with the forward ambulation, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=301.18s)]
*  with the walk and the optic flow that I talked about before. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=303.02000000000004s)]
*  And that's what I do each morning [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=306.1s)]
*  to generate a sense of alertness in my body and brain [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=308.08000000000004s)]
*  to generate a sense of calm yet alert. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=311.46000000000004s)]
*  So now we have a first protocol, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=314.8s)]
*  which is to write down the time of day that you wake up. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=316.6s)]
*  The second protocol is to get, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=318.52000000000004s)]
*  take a walk first thing in the morning. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=320.3s)]
*  And the third protocol is woven in with that walk, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  at least for me, which is to get that sunlight exposure. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  I'm a big believer based on quality peer review data [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=330.36s)]
*  that hydration is essential for mental performance. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=334.08000000000004s)]
*  As many of you know, neurons require ionic flow. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=337.8s)]
*  What that means is neurons need sodium, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=341.56s)]
*  they need magnesium and they need potassium [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=344.16s)]
*  in order to function. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=346.0s)]
*  We do tend to get dehydrated at night. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=347.76000000000005s)]
*  I try and make sure that I'm hydrated early in the day [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=350.12s)]
*  before I begin any work. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=352.92s)]
*  So I make myself drink this water [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=355.0s)]
*  with a little bit of sea salt. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=357.92s)]
*  How much sea salt, if you really want to get detailed, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=359.12s)]
*  I suppose it's about half a teaspoon. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=361.36s)]
*  It's not much. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=363.12s)]
*  At that point, I start craving caffeine, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=364.68s)]
*  but I don't drink that caffeine yet. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=366.8s)]
*  I purposely delay my caffeine intake [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  to 90 minutes to 120 minutes after I wake up. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=372.56s)]
*  The reason I delay caffeine is because one of the factors [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=376.68s)]
*  that induces a sense of sleepiness [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=380.56s)]
*  is the buildup of adenosine. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=382.88s)]
*  The buildup of adenosine accumulates [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  the longer we are awake. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=388.4s)]
*  When you wake up in the morning, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=390.08s)]
*  your adenosine levels are likely to be very low. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=391.46s)]
*  However, caffeine is an adenosine blocker. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=395.36s)]
*  It's actually a competitive antagonist [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=399.76s)]
*  for you aficionados. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=401.6s)]
*  It sort of parks in the receptor [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=402.56s)]
*  that adenosine normally would park at [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=404.44s)]
*  and prevents adenosine from acting on that receptor. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=407.0s)]
*  That's why you feel more alert. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=410.24s)]
*  The reason for delaying caffeine intake 90 minutes [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=411.52000000000004s)]
*  to two hours after waking is I want to make sure [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=413.96000000000004s)]
*  that I don't have a late afternoon [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=417.64000000000004s)]
*  or even early afternoon crash from caffeine. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=420.0s)]
*  One of the best ways to ensure a caffeine crash [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=423.24s)]
*  is to drink a bunch of caffeine, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=426.72s)]
*  block all those adenosine receptors, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=428.68s)]
*  and then by early or late afternoon, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=430.52s)]
*  when that caffeine starts to wear off [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=433.12s)]
*  and gets dislodged from the receptors, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=435.06s)]
*  a lower level of adenosine is able [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=437.94s)]
*  to create a greater level of sleepiness. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=440.12s)]
*  Delaying caffeine a 90 minutes to two hours [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=443.41999999999996s)]
*  optimizes this relationship between adenosine [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=445.84s)]
*  and wakefulness and sleepiness [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=448.56s)]
*  in a way that really provides a nice, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=450.35999999999996s)]
*  consistent arc of energy throughout the day [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=452.56s)]
*  and brings energy down as I'm headed toward sleep [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=455.35999999999996s)]
*  and falling asleep. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=458.24s)]
*  My primary objective early in the day [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=459.54s)]
*  is to get into a mode of being focused yet alert [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=461.74s)]
*  so that I can get work done. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=464.70000000000005s)]
*  I found that the best way for me to achieve that state [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=466.98s)]
*  is through fasting. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=469.78000000000003s)]
*  So I don't eat anything until about 11 a.m. or 12 noon. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=471.26000000000005s)]
*  Fasting increases levels of adrenaline, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=476.66s)]
*  also called epinephrine in the brain and body. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=479.70000000000005s)]
*  And when our levels of epinephrine and adrenaline [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=482.18s)]
*  are increased, we learn better, we can focus better. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=484.66s)]
*  You don't want epinephrine, AKA adrenaline, too high. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=488.1s)]
*  That feels like stress and panic. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=492.90000000000003s)]
*  You get jittery, you can't focus. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=494.90000000000003s)]
*  But in its optimal range, adrenaline really provides [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=496.98s)]
*  a heightened sense of focus and the ability to encode, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=500.74s)]
*  meaning bring in and retain, remember information. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=504.46000000000004s)]
*  Next, I want to talk about what I'm doing while I'm working. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=507.78000000000003s)]
*  A couple of things for optimizing workspace [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=511.02000000000004s)]
*  that are grounded in neuroscience and physiology. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=513.38s)]
*  I've talked before about the fact that [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=516.9s)]
*  when our eyes are directed upward, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=519.26s)]
*  it creates a state of heightened alertness. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=521.5s)]
*  And this has a relationship to the brainstem neurons [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=524.4599999999999s)]
*  that create alertness and their control over the muscles [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=527.66s)]
*  of the eye and believe it or not, the eyelids. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=532.9s)]
*  The point here is that you can optimize your workstation [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=535.9399999999999s)]
*  in a physical way that leverages this aspect [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=539.88s)]
*  of the visual system and your level of alertness. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=543.54s)]
*  Try and position your screen or your tablet, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=545.74s)]
*  whatever device you happen to be working on, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=548.92s)]
*  at least at eye level and ideally slightly higher. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=551.34s)]
*  Most people are looking down at their computer or tablet [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=555.14s)]
*  or are angling their eyes at their screen [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=557.78s)]
*  at about 30 degrees. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=560.86s)]
*  When we look down, when our eyelids are slightly closed, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=562.3s)]
*  it tends to decrease our levels of alertness [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=565.9s)]
*  and increase our levels of sleepiness. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=567.96s)]
*  So we're now at the description of my day [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=570.0s)]
*  in these protocols in which I would do [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=573.2s)]
*  a 90 minute bout of work. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=575.0400000000001s)]
*  Now, why 90 minutes? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=577.72s)]
*  Well, the brain is going through these 90 minutes, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=578.9200000000001s)]
*  so-called Ultradian cycles throughout the entire day [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=581.8000000000001s)]
*  and night. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=584.4200000000001s)]
*  Every 90 minutes, we shift over from being very alert [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=585.26s)]
*  to being less alert and then back to alert again. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=589.12s)]
*  Here's how it works. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=590.88s)]
*  At the start of one of these 90 minute Ultradian cycles, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=592.4000000000001s)]
*  my brain is not quite engaged [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=596.1s)]
*  in whatever it is I'm trying to do, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=599.08s)]
*  but I set a timer for 90 minutes [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=600.72s)]
*  and I try and get a strong bout of work done [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=604.22s)]
*  inside of that 90 minutes with the full understanding [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=607.46s)]
*  that the entire 90 minutes is not going to be uniform [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=609.9200000000001s)]
*  in terms of my ability of focus. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=612.78s)]
*  So the goal is to get into what I call the tunnel, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=614.28s)]
*  to really get into a tunnel of quality work. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=616.44s)]
*  The brain loves that state, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=619.1s)]
*  but it's very hard for many of us to access. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=621.1s)]
*  My phone is absolutely off. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=623.94s)]
*  It's not on airplane mode. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=626.22s)]
*  It's absolutely off during this time. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=627.38s)]
*  In addition, I use low level white noise. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=629.72s)]
*  White noise, which is essentially all frequencies of sound [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=633.2s)]
*  or all frequencies of sound that we can perceive, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=637.32s)]
*  mixed up kind of randomly, there's no structure to it, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=639.84s)]
*  turned on at a low volume, puts the brain into a state [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=642.5s)]
*  that's optimal for learning and workflow. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=646.0s)]
*  So everything about this 90 minute block [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=648.5400000000001s)]
*  from the low levels of white noise [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=650.4s)]
*  to the position of my computer, how I'm standing, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=651.82s)]
*  where my eyes are positioned is geared towards [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=654.48s)]
*  putting me in this tunnel of work. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=656.48s)]
*  And I have to say that while it can be a challenge [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=658.38s)]
*  to try and achieve this state and this tunnel of work, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=660.38s)]
*  some days you start to get kind of addicted to it. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=663.18s)]
*  It feels really good. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=666.1s)]
*  It's like a workout for the mind. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=667.52s)]
*  And it is something that as you exit that 90 minutes, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=668.98s)]
*  you really feel like you've accomplished a lot [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=672.54s)]
*  because often you have, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=674.7s)]
*  and it just feels deeply satisfying. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=676.26s)]
*  And I'm convinced that that's because of the release [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=678.64s)]
*  of neuromodulators like dopamine [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=680.98s)]
*  and the norepinephrine that's circulating in your system. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=682.58s)]
*  And I want to be clear that I'm not perfect [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=686.34s)]
*  about this 90 minutes. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=688.5s)]
*  Occasionally I get drawn away, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=689.4200000000001s)]
*  but I really try and achieve this most, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=691.0600000000001s)]
*  if not every day that I'm alive, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=693.26s)]
*  because for me that work session is kind of holy. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=695.12s)]
*  There's a powerful way in which you can place the timing [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=698.6600000000001s)]
*  of this 90 minute work bout in an optimal way. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=701.32s)]
*  You have access to a very important piece of data [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=705.94s)]
*  that dictates when this bout should start more or less [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=709.5s)]
*  and when it should end. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=713.82s)]
*  That piece of data is your temperature minimum. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=716.38s)]
*  If you're somebody who wakes up on average at 7 a.m., [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=718.9s)]
*  well then your temperature minimum is 5 a.m. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=722.08s)]
*  You can be reasonably sure that your best work [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=724.46s)]
*  is going to be done anywhere from four to six hours [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=727.6600000000001s)]
*  after your temperature minimum. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=731.5400000000001s)]
*  How do I know this? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=733.26s)]
*  How do I know this relationship [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=734.08s)]
*  between temperature minimum and focused cognition? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=735.26s)]
*  Well, temperature minimum defines the trough, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=738.0600000000001s)]
*  the nadir as they say of your temperature [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=742.02s)]
*  across the 24 hour cycle. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=745.42s)]
*  And immediately after that, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=746.88s)]
*  your temperature will start to rise. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=748.66s)]
*  That temperature rise is actually what triggers [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=751.04s)]
*  the initial cortisol release that you experience [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=753.6999999999999s)]
*  and wakes you up further. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=756.54s)]
*  And then of course that sunlight that you're getting [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=757.8199999999999s)]
*  is going to further enhance [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=759.8199999999999s)]
*  that healthy release of cortisol. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=761.0s)]
*  That cortisol will then provide fuel, if you will, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=763.26s)]
*  for that increase in temperature. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=766.52s)]
*  And your body will continue to increase in temperature [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=767.9799999999999s)]
*  throughout the day toward the afternoon. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=770.54s)]
*  What you're trying to do in this idea of optimizing [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=773.06s)]
*  this 90 minute work bout to a particular time of day [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=777.26s)]
*  is catch the portion of the steepest slope [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=780.0999999999999s)]
*  of that temperature rise. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=782.8199999999999s)]
*  So if you're somebody who wakes up at 8 a.m. each morning, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=784.3599999999999s)]
*  your temperature minimum is 6 a.m., [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=787.92s)]
*  chances are you're going to want to start this work bout [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=789.8199999999999s)]
*  somewhere around 10 a.m. or 11 a.m. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=792.66s)]
*  Now, some people wake up and feel very alert [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=796.9599999999999s)]
*  first thing in the morning. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=799.6999999999999s)]
*  They can really do their best work [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=800.54s)]
*  first thing in the morning. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=801.98s)]
*  Please, if that's you, continue to do that. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=803.38s)]
*  Leverage that time, use that time. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=806.0999999999999s)]
*  But if you're somebody who struggles to find focus, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=808.64s)]
*  definitely let your physiology [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=812.0s)]
*  and this rise in your body temperature [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=814.02s)]
*  support your efforts to focus [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=816.02s)]
*  rather than trying to do your best work at times of day [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=818.3s)]
*  when your physiology is actually directing your body [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=822.14s)]
*  and your brain toward defocus [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=826.06s)]
*  and towards being more lethargic. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=827.62s)]
*  It just is setting yourself up for success [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=829.04s)]
*  when you try and capture this rising phase [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=832.56s)]
*  of your temperature. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=834.7199999999999s)]
*  Data going back to the 1990s supports the idea [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=835.5999999999999s)]
*  that physical movement of particular kinds [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=839.88s)]
*  can support brain health and brain function, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=842.74s)]
*  both in the immediate term and in the long term. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=845.04s)]
*  So after I've finished a bout of work, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=847.8s)]
*  this 90-minute bout of work, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=850.98s)]
*  I force myself to do some sort of physical exercise [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=852.56s)]
*  that is going to be supportive of my brain health [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=855.74s)]
*  and brain function and organ health [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=858.3s)]
*  and bodily function in general. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=860.3199999999999s)]
*  Now there are various forms of physical activity [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=862.2199999999999s)]
*  or what we call exercise, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=864.6999999999999s)]
*  but those can generally be batched into two categories. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=866.4599999999999s)]
*  First is strength and hypertrophy work. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=869.92s)]
*  So physical movements that are designed to make you stronger [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=872.92s)]
*  and or make your muscles larger. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=876.42s)]
*  There's also endurance work, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=879.4399999999999s)]
*  physical exercise and movements that are designed [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=881.9s)]
*  to allow you to do more work over time [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=884.3s)]
*  or to extend the amount of time that you can do work [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=887.66s)]
*  of any kind, both physical and mental. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=890.68s)]
*  The data all point to the fact that working out hard [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=893.66s)]
*  for longer than an hour can actually be detrimental [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=896.26s)]
*  because of the way that it raises cortisol. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=899.24s)]
*  And cortisol can be a good thing [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=901.7199999999999s)]
*  if it's appropriately timed [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=903.14s)]
*  and in the appropriate low levels, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=904.38s)]
*  but you don't want to have your cortisol levels up [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=906.04s)]
*  throughout the day or have big spikes [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=908.74s)]
*  of cortisol repeatedly. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=910.54s)]
*  So keeping workouts relatively short [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=912.66s)]
*  can definitely help with that. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=914.5799999999999s)]
*  Endurance work and strength training [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=916.18s)]
*  or hypertrophy training done in combination, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=919.7399999999999s)]
*  meaning not necessarily in the same workout, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=923.0799999999999s)]
*  but done across the week is immensely beneficial [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=925.0799999999999s)]
*  for the production of things [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=928.78s)]
*  like brain-derived neurotrophic factor, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=929.8599999999999s)]
*  for limiting inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=931.9399999999999s)]
*  for promoting anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=936.0999999999999s)]
*  provided that exercises of the proper duration [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=939.38s)]
*  and that it's not so intense [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=942.5799999999999s)]
*  that you're actually creating damage [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=944.86s)]
*  to the various systems of the body. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=946.76s)]
*  What about the structure of the actual workouts? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=949.08s)]
*  Well, approximately 80% of the resistance training you do [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=950.92s)]
*  should be resistance training [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=955.5s)]
*  that doesn't go to what they call failure, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=956.78s)]
*  where you can't actually move the resistance anymore. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=958.5s)]
*  The other 20% can be of the higher intensity [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=962.96s)]
*  to failure type training. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=965.66s)]
*  That 80-20 rule of less than failure [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=967.5s)]
*  and work to failure in the resistance exercise regime [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=971.34s)]
*  can be transported or translated [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=974.72s)]
*  to the endurance exercise portion [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=977.0s)]
*  by focusing on that thing that we're familiar with, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=979.26s)]
*  which is the burn. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=981.4200000000001s)]
*  When we're running hard or cycling hard, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=982.26s)]
*  we'll experience a kind of burning of the muscles [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=984.0s)]
*  that's associated with the lactate system. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=985.78s)]
*  And actually the lactate system [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=988.88s)]
*  is its own form of fuel for the brain. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=990.84s)]
*  And so there's increasing interest [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=993.1600000000001s)]
*  in pushing past that lactate threshold [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=995.0s)]
*  for small portions, 20% or so of endurance work [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1000.28s)]
*  in order to support brain health and function. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1003.08s)]
*  So on any given day, I finish that work block and I train. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1005.2800000000001s)]
*  I do some sort of resistance or endurance training. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1009.38s)]
*  I put those on alternate days or different days rather. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1011.6800000000001s)]
*  So we've now talked about the arc that spans [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1015.2s)]
*  all the way from waking to a morning bout of focused work [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1017.6s)]
*  to physical training. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1023.1600000000001s)]
*  I have not mentioned ingesting anything or nutrients. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1025.88s)]
*  One of the most common questions I get [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1029.1000000000001s)]
*  are what should I eat for my brain? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1030.44s)]
*  Well, ironically enough, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1032.48s)]
*  one of the best things you can do for your brain [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1034.48s)]
*  is do not eat, but of course we all have to eat sooner or [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1035.94s)]
*  later. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1038.66s)]
*  So let's talk about food timing first. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1039.5s)]
*  As I mentioned, I eat my first meal sometime around noon, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1041.58s)]
*  plus or minus an hour. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1044.88s)]
*  The volume of food is also important. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1046.34s)]
*  If you eat a large volume of anything, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1050.1s)]
*  because it diverts blood to your gut, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1052.2s)]
*  you will feel lethargic and you will have less blood going [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1054.98s)]
*  to your brain. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1058.16s)]
*  That seems like a simple and trivial fact, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1059.26s)]
*  but if you want to be able to think, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1061.08s)]
*  you can't ingest large volumes of anything into your gut. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1063.1999999999998s)]
*  So for lunch, I do emphasize slightly lower carbohydrate [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1066.72s)]
*  or low carbohydrate intake for the simple reason [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1071.0s)]
*  that adrenaline and dopamine [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1074.28s)]
*  and their associated neuromodulators [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1077.1599999999999s)]
*  are going to support alertness. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1079.52s)]
*  So for me, I fast up until about noon, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1081.6399999999999s)]
*  then I eat a lunch that consists of some sort of protein [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1085.4399999999998s)]
*  thing like some meat or some chicken or some salmon [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1089.0s)]
*  and some vegetables, et cetera. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1092.48s)]
*  And if I've exercised previously, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1094.44s)]
*  which I do, as I mentioned, five days a week, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1097.38s)]
*  then I will ingest some starches. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1099.84s)]
*  I'll ingest some bread, excuse me, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1101.74s)]
*  or rice or oatmeal and butter and nuts and things like that. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1104.36s)]
*  But I will keep the total amount of carbohydrate a little bit [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1107.68s)]
*  on the low side, or if I haven't trained, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1111.4s)]
*  I won't have any carbohydrate at all. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1113.32s)]
*  Not because I'm ketogenic, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1116.14s)]
*  but because starches cause the release [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1117.86s)]
*  of serotonin in the brain [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1121.9399999999998s)]
*  and lend themselves to a state of sleepiness. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1123.6599999999999s)]
*  Now, what about components of foods [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1126.5s)]
*  that are not about alertness, but are about mood? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1128.56s)]
*  We did an entire episode on mood and food, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1131.12s)]
*  and it's very clear based on now dozens of studies [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1133.34s)]
*  that ingesting sufficient levels of omega-3 fatty acids [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1137.12s)]
*  is going to support healthy mood [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1142.3799999999999s)]
*  and even can act as an antidepressant. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1144.54s)]
*  Ingesting at least 1000 milligrams per day [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1147.18s)]
*  of the EPA form of essential fatty acid [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1150.3000000000002s)]
*  is as effective as prescription antidepressants [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1153.8200000000002s)]
*  in relieving depression. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1157.64s)]
*  And if you're somebody who requires [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1159.3000000000002s)]
*  prescription antidepressants, Prozac, Zoloft, et cetera, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1160.9s)]
*  it can allow people to take lower doses [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1164.5s)]
*  of those medications. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1168.0600000000002s)]
*  A key aspect to the mid-day meal, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1169.38s)]
*  if you want that meal to benefit you, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1172.7s)]
*  is to take a brief walk afterwards. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1175.1s)]
*  It turns out that brief walks of five to 30 minutes [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1177.6399999999999s)]
*  after ingesting food can accelerate metabolism [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1180.52s)]
*  and actually can accelerate and improve nutrient utilization, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1183.4399999999998s)]
*  which is essentially the same as metabolism. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1187.52s)]
*  But nonetheless, that's something that I do [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1189.1999999999998s)]
*  after I finish my noon meal. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1192.0s)]
*  I do force myself to stand up and go outside [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1193.9199999999998s)]
*  and take a brief walk. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1197.8s)]
*  That also gets me again into optic flow. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1198.76s)]
*  It also has another benefit, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1200.74s)]
*  which is that I am giving my brain and thereby my body [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1201.96s)]
*  more information about light and time of day, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1206.28s)]
*  which is always better than less information [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1208.7s)]
*  about light and time of day. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1210.88s)]
*  A key protocol for sleep health and wakefulness [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1212.8400000000001s)]
*  and metabolism and hormone health [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1215.76s)]
*  is viewing light in the afternoon. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1218.32s)]
*  So here's the reason for doing this. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1221.48s)]
*  As we progress into the evening hours, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1224.46s)]
*  there's a phenomenon where our retina, our eyes, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1227.54s)]
*  become very sensitive to light, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1231.12s)]
*  such that if we view bright lights [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1233.32s)]
*  or even not so bright lights [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1236.52s)]
*  between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m., [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1238.7199999999998s)]
*  that is strongly disruptive, very disruptive [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1242.56s)]
*  for our dopamine production. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1246.28s)]
*  It can really screw up our sleep. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1248.82s)]
*  But if you can get outside and see the sun as it arcs down, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1250.9599999999998s)]
*  or if you can't see the sun directly, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1254.8799999999999s)]
*  get some sunlight in your eyes in the afternoon hours, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1256.36s)]
*  so maybe 4 p.m.ish, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1260.08s)]
*  what it does is it lowers the sensitivity of your retina [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1261.8s)]
*  in the late evening hours, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1266.72s)]
*  which allows you to buffer yourself [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1268.28s)]
*  against the negative effects of bright light later at night. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1271.08s)]
*  Now, we haven't talked too much about melatonin, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1274.12s)]
*  but melatonin is a hormone that is inhibited by light. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1275.84s)]
*  Melatonin is the hormone [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1280.6799999999998s)]
*  that allows you to fall asleep easily. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1282.0s)]
*  Now, I'm not talking about supplementing melatonin. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1284.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm talking about melatonin [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1286.6799999999998s)]
*  that you naturally produce from your pineal. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1288.48s)]
*  So the protocol is very simple. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1290.96s)]
*  Get outside in the afternoon or evening [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1293.06s)]
*  for 10 to 30 minutes, take your sunglasses off, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1295.48s)]
*  so get that afternoon light. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1298.76s)]
*  So what you'll probably notice [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1300.3s)]
*  is that the optimal protocols [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1301.68s)]
*  for optimizing your brain and body health [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1303.8s)]
*  and performance and sleep, et cetera, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1306.42s)]
*  are actually really simple. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1308.52s)]
*  But just because they're simple [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1310.64s)]
*  does not mean that they are not powerful. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1311.84s)]
*  In fact, they are very powerful [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1314.26s)]
*  because they leverage the most powerful technology [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1315.52s)]
*  that exists, which is your nervous system. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1318.72s)]
*  What we are talking about today are really basic things [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1320.68s)]
*  that we can all do that can steer our neurology [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1324.12s)]
*  and our biology in the directions [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1327.36s)]
*  that are going to support workflow, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1329.56s)]
*  that are going to support hormones, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1331.92s)]
*  that are going to support brain function. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1333.26s)]
*  So at some point in the evening, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1335.44s)]
*  I eat that thing that we call dinner. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1337.52s)]
*  And while it feels sort of strange to talk about my dinner, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1339.82s)]
*  the reason I want to talk about my dinner [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1343.72s)]
*  and what I eat for dinner is that, for me, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1345.64s)]
*  dinner, of course, is about eating, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1348.1200000000001s)]
*  but also about optimizing the transition to sleep. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1350.04s)]
*  So my dinner generally is comprised of things [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1353.32s)]
*  that are going to support rest and deep sleep. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1356.64s)]
*  And that means starchy carbohydrates. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1359.7s)]
*  It's absolutely clear that one of the major ways [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1362.72s)]
*  that we can increase serotonin, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1365.64s)]
*  which helps in the transition to sleep, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1367.44s)]
*  is by ingesting starchy carbohydrates. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1370.4s)]
*  So my dinner is carbohydrates and some protein. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1372.84s)]
*  So maybe some chicken or fish or something like that, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1376.3s)]
*  maybe some eggs, or sometimes just pasta [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1378.1999999999998s)]
*  or just rice and vegetables. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1380.58s)]
*  And that's because I enjoy those foods, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1382.48s)]
*  but also because I want to increase the amount [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1384.8799999999999s)]
*  of serotonin in my brain [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1388.52s)]
*  so that I can actually fall asleep that night. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1389.6799999999998s)]
*  Many people who are on low carbohydrate diets [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1391.6s)]
*  struggle with falling and staying asleep. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1393.6799999999998s)]
*  And that's because it's hard to achieve heightened levels [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1396.08s)]
*  of serotonin, which are necessary to enter sleep. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1398.84s)]
*  I should also mention that melatonin and serotonin [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1402.8s)]
*  fall in the same pathway. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1405.4199999999998s)]
*  They are related hormones and neuromodulators. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1406.96s)]
*  Essentially what we're talking about is a system [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1409.82s)]
*  that's biasing us towards rest and relaxation [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1412.3s)]
*  as opposed to wakefulness. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1414.8s)]
*  You might ask, well, can't I just take serotonin? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1416.84s)]
*  Can't I just take 5-HTP or a precursor to serotonin [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1419.04s)]
*  or tryptophan? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1421.84s)]
*  And indeed you can. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1422.68s)]
*  However, many people, including myself, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1424.24s)]
*  find that when they supplement with serotonin [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1426.08s)]
*  in the evening or at night, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1427.98s)]
*  that can cause problems in the architecture [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1430.28s)]
*  or the structure of sleep. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1432.76s)]
*  It can cause a lot of people, including me, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1434.84s)]
*  to fall asleep very fast, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1436.52s)]
*  sleep very deeply for three or four hours, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1438.28s)]
*  and then wake up and have a terrible time [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1439.96s)]
*  falling back asleep. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1442.28s)]
*  And that effect, at least for me, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1443.4199999999998s)]
*  can last several days. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1445.12s)]
*  It's really disruptive. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1447.1599999999999s)]
*  So I don't like to supplement with anything [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1448.24s)]
*  that is directly dopamine or a precursor to dopamine [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1450.46s)]
*  at any time or directly serotonin [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1454.1799999999998s)]
*  or a precursor to serotonin. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1456.6799999999998s)]
*  Rather, there are other things that can enhance [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1458.04s)]
*  the transition to sleep safely, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1460.02s)]
*  which we will talk about in a few minutes. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1461.6399999999999s)]
*  But the evening meal consists largely of carbohydrates [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1463.3s)]
*  for that specific purpose of generating a sense of calm. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1466.06s)]
*  And of course, carbohydrates are delicious. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1471.0s)]
*  And because I'm doing some physical training, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1472.82s)]
*  and presumably you are as well, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1475.44s)]
*  or I hope you are, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1476.8799999999999s)]
*  because it's so beneficial to one's health, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1477.7s)]
*  that's also going to replenish my glycogen stores, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1480.44s)]
*  which is one of the primary fuel sources [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1483.2s)]
*  for moving one's muscles and moving around [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1485.52s)]
*  and doing exercise, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1487.58s)]
*  as well as for the brain and for cognitive function. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1488.4199999999998s)]
*  So let's talk about sleep and how to access sleep. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1491.1799999999998s)]
*  One way to do that is to leverage the drop in temperature [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1494.4399999999998s)]
*  that's necessary to fall and stay asleep. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1497.6s)]
*  So as I mentioned earlier, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1500.6999999999998s)]
*  in the early parts of the day after waking, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1502.76s)]
*  our body temperature is rising, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1506.06s)]
*  and that continues throughout the day. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1507.6599999999999s)]
*  And then sometime late in the afternoon, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1508.86s)]
*  our temperature peaks, and then it starts to drop. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1510.6s)]
*  That drop in temperature of one to three degrees [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1514.44s)]
*  is vitally important for us [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1517.8s)]
*  to be able to fall asleep easily. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1519.22s)]
*  One way that we can decrease our transition time into sleep [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1521.88s)]
*  is to accelerate that drop in temperature. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1525.38s)]
*  And one way to accelerate that drop in temperature, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1528.24s)]
*  somewhat counter-intuitively, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1531.22s)]
*  is to use hot baths, hot showers, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1533.1000000000001s)]
*  or if you have access to one, a sauna. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1536.56s)]
*  Now this is counter-intuitive, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1538.88s)]
*  but actually if you were to get into a sauna [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1540.04s)]
*  or a hot shower or a hot bath, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1542.7s)]
*  and then get out, your body is going to engage [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1544.02s)]
*  particular mechanisms for cooling itself off [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1547.24s)]
*  that are going to allow you to drop your temperature [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1550.22s)]
*  more quickly and fall asleep more easily. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1552.72s)]
*  It is absolutely true [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1555.18s)]
*  that keeping the room very dark is beneficial. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1556.22s)]
*  The other thing is keeping the room cool. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1558.94s)]
*  The reason keeping the room cool is useful [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1560.66s)]
*  for getting into and staying asleep [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1563.42s)]
*  is that throughout the night, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1565.6s)]
*  there are phases of sleep where you are paralyzed, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1567.86s)]
*  so-called REM sleep, that's a healthy paralysis, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1570.1399999999999s)]
*  presumably so you can't act out your dreams. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1572.74s)]
*  But there are portions of the night where you can move. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1574.88s)]
*  And one of the more important movements [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1576.76s)]
*  that you do in the middle of the night [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1578.14s)]
*  is put your hand out or your foot out, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1579.94s)]
*  or you take your face out from under the covers [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1583.0s)]
*  as a means to cool yourself. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1585.6s)]
*  You're actually allowing cooling of the body [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1587.26s)]
*  through what are called AVA's, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1590.1s)]
*  arteriovenous estomoses is the technical name, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1593.7s)]
*  that are in the palms, the upper half of the face, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1597.1s)]
*  and the bottoms of the feet. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1599.38s)]
*  Now, there are things that one can take [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1600.64s)]
*  to enhance the transition to sleep. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1604.5200000000002s)]
*  Three compounds that could be very beneficial [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1606.0s)]
*  for aiding the transition to sleep [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1608.0s)]
*  and for which there are wide safety margins, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1609.92s)]
*  although please do check with your physician [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1612.88s)]
*  before taking anything, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1614.48s)]
*  are specific forms of magnesium, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1616.0s)]
*  something called apigenin and theanine. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1618.44s)]
*  Magnesium comes in many forms. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1620.92s)]
*  Magnesium threonate, that's T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1622.6000000000001s)]
*  threonate and magnesium biglycinate [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1626.1200000000001s)]
*  have transporters that allow them [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1629.28s)]
*  to cross the blood brain barrier more readily [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1631.3999999999999s)]
*  than other forms of magnesium. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1633.44s)]
*  And there within the brain, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1634.96s)]
*  they promote the release of a neurotransmitter called GABA, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1636.76s)]
*  which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1639.6s)]
*  which shuts off the forebrain to some extent. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1641.36s)]
*  It doesn't shut off completely, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1644.28s)]
*  but it essentially shuts down thinking, rumination, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1645.32s)]
*  planning, and then what we call executive function. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1647.8999999999999s)]
*  So for many people taking 300 to 400 milligrams [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1650.52s)]
*  of magnesium biglycinate or magnesium threonate, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1654.7s)]
*  30 to 60 minutes before sleep can aid them [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1657.76s)]
*  in falling asleep. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1660.96s)]
*  When coupled with apigenin and theanine, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1661.8s)]
*  provide a sort of synergy or a sleep cocktail [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1664.36s)]
*  that seems to be very effective [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1667.78s)]
*  in aiding the transition to sleep. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1670.32s)]
*  So apigenin is the substance that's found in chamomile, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1672.64s)]
*  and 50 milligrams of apigenin taken 30 minutes before sleep [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1676.56s)]
*  can act as another way to shut off the forebrain [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1680.36s)]
*  and reduce rumination, reduce anxiety, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1684.04s)]
*  and allow people to fall and stay asleep. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1686.24s)]
*  And then the third compound is theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1689.36s)]
*  Theanine is a compound that can also increase GABA, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1694.1200000000001s)]
*  but also increases activation [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1699.6s)]
*  of something called chloride channels. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1701.38s)]
*  Chloride channels are another way [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1703.1200000000001s)]
*  in which neurons lower their levels of activity. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1704.5s)]
*  So magnesium threonate or biglycinate, apigenin, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1707.24s)]
*  and theanine in combination can be very effective [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1710.28s)]
*  for aiding the transition to sleep. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1713.84s)]
*  Now, what if you wake up in the middle of the night? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1715.64s)]
*  This is a very common occurrence. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1718.0s)]
*  And there are two general themes around waking up [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1720.18s)]
*  in the middle of the night [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1723.3000000000002s)]
*  that one can use tools to counteract. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1724.42s)]
*  The first theme is if you're somebody [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1728.0800000000002s)]
*  who is tired in the evenings [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1730.14s)]
*  and you're kind of pushing yourself to stay awake. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1732.3200000000002s)]
*  So you're going to the party [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1735.0400000000002s)]
*  or you're pushing yourself to study or work [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1736.64s)]
*  when in fact you'd like to get into bed at 8, 30 or 9, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1739.16s)]
*  and then you're falling asleep around 10, 30, 11, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1741.5600000000002s)]
*  and waking up at 2, 30 or 3 in the morning [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1743.88s)]
*  and you can't fall back asleep. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1745.7600000000002s)]
*  Chances are that your melatonin pulse [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1747.5600000000002s)]
*  was initiated early in the night. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1750.3400000000001s)]
*  So that melatonin pulse started probably around 8, 30 or 9, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1752.7800000000002s)]
*  but you're staying up, you're battling that melatonin. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1757.92s)]
*  You may not like this advice, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1760.7600000000002s)]
*  but one of the things that you can do to offset that [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1761.8000000000002s)]
*  is to simply go to bed earlier. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1763.44s)]
*  The other thing is many people wake up [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1765.5400000000002s)]
*  in the middle of the night because of anxiety [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1767.7s)]
*  or because they have to use the restroom. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1769.88s)]
*  It's perfectly fine to flip on the lights, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1772.16s)]
*  but keep the lights dim. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1773.84s)]
*  But if you flip on those lights, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1776.04s)]
*  try and flip them off as soon as possible [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1777.3999999999999s)]
*  and try and get back into bed. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1779.84s)]
*  So now we've essentially traveled around the clock, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1781.6599999999999s)]
*  so to speak, from the time where one wakes up [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1784.6999999999998s)]
*  until the time they get to sleep, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1787.6399999999999s)]
*  maybe wake up, get back to sleep, et cetera. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1790.1999999999998s)]
*  I want to emphasize that although people's schedules vary, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1793.56s)]
*  most people are doing more than one or two work bouts per day. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1796.84s)]
*  And indeed, I'm doing more than one [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1800.96s)]
*  or two work bouts per day. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1803.04s)]
*  I really emphasize that morning 90-minute work block [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1804.58s)]
*  because I think most people would agree [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1807.56s)]
*  that there's a portion of each day [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1810.6000000000001s)]
*  in which we need to do the hardest thing [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1812.88s)]
*  or the most important thing [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1815.06s)]
*  or the thing that demands the most of our cognitive self. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1816.82s)]
*  I position that early in the day [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1821.24s)]
*  and I position everything around that [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1822.8s)]
*  in order to ensure that it happens [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1825.1000000000001s)]
*  and that it happens with the highest degree of efficiency, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1827.08s)]
*  even though that morning 90-minute work block is so vital. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1829.96s)]
*  Of course, there's a second work block. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1834.76s)]
*  So combined, that's just three hours of focused work, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1836.88s)]
*  which may not seem like a lot, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1839.4s)]
*  but if you were to dissect your day [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1841.4s)]
*  and kind of look at the arc and structure of your day, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1843.3600000000001s)]
*  I'd be willing to bet that if we added up [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1846.0s)]
*  the total period of time in which you were in deep work, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1849.88s)]
*  really focused, dedicated work, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1853.24s)]
*  that it would probably amount to about three or four hours. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1855.04s)]
*  And of course, throughout the day, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1858.1200000000001s)]
*  there are other things happening. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1859.56s)]
*  Outside of those 90-minute work blocks, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1861.08s)]
*  I'm checking my text messages, I'm checking my email, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1863.46s)]
*  I'm responding to various demands, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1866.0s)]
*  I'm working and tending to life. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1867.7s)]
*  So while I've carved some boundaries [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1870.6399999999999s)]
*  or delineate some boundaries around those work blocks, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1873.72s)]
*  and I'm certain that if you do too, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1876.24s)]
*  you will benefit from them, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1878.1599999999999s)]
*  of course, please adapt and modify [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1879.56s)]
*  what I've described today [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1882.74s)]
*  in ways that best serve you and your schedule. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1884.02s)]
*  What I've tried to do is provide you scientific support, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1886.44s)]
*  specific protocols and regimens, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1890.76s)]
*  because people are always asking me [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1892.68s)]
*  for more specificity and detail, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1894.24s)]
*  and an example of one way, just one way, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1896.1200000000001s)]
*  in which these various tools and protocols [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1899.96s)]
*  that are grounded in science [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1902.18s)]
*  could be leveraged in one's own life. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1903.38s)]
*  And last but not least, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1905.3600000000001s)]
*  thank you for your interest in science. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1906.72s)]
*  And last but not least, thank you for your interest in science. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw&t=1908.68s)]
