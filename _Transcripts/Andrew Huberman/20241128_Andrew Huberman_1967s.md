# Essentials Using Science to Optimize Sleep, Learning & Metabolism
**Andrew Huberman:** [November 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-H_A_dQUxQ)
*  Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
*  where we revisit past episodes
*  for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
*  for mental health, physical health, and performance.
*  I'm Andrew Huberman,
*  and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
*  at Stanford School of Medicine.
*  Today is episode three of the podcast,
*  and it is office hours.
*  Office hours, as many of you know,
*  it's where students come to the office of the professor,
*  sit down and ask questions,
*  requesting clarification about things
*  that were confusing,
*  or to simply go down the route of exploring a topic
*  with more depth and detail.
*  Somebody asked,
*  what is the role of moonlight and fire?
*  I'm presuming they mean fireplace or candle
*  or things of that sort.
*  In setting circadian rhythms,
*  is it okay to view moonlight at night,
*  or will that wake me up?
*  Will a fire in my fireplace
*  or using candlelight be too much light?
*  Great question.
*  Turns out that moonlight, candlelight,
*  and even a fireplace,
*  if you have one of these roaring fires
*  going in the fireplace,
*  do not reset your circadian clock at night
*  and trick your brain into thinking that it's morning,
*  even though if you've ever sat close to a fireplace
*  or even a candle, that light seems very bright.
*  And there are two reasons for that that are very important.
*  The first one is that these neurons in your eye
*  that I discussed in the previous episode,
*  these melanopsin ganglion cells,
*  also called intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells,
*  those cells adjust their sensitivity across the day.
*  And those cells respond best
*  to the blue-yellow contrast present
*  in the rising and setting sun,
*  so-called low solar angle sun,
*  also discussed in the previous episode.
*  But those cells adjust their sensitivity
*  such that they will not activate the triggers in the brain
*  that convey daytime signals when they view moonlight,
*  even a full moon, a really bright moon or fire.
*  Because we talked about just how crucial it is
*  to avoid bright lights between the hours
*  of about 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.,
*  except when you need to view things for sake of safety
*  or work and so forth.
*  I also received a lot of questions about red light.
*  In principle, red light will not stimulate
*  the melanopsin retinal neurons that wake up the brain
*  and circadian clock and signal daytime.
*  However, most of the red lights,
*  in particular the red lights that come on these sheets
*  or these products that people are supposed to view them
*  in order to access a number of health effects,
*  those are way too bright
*  and would definitely wake up your body and brain.
*  So if you're thinking about red light for sake
*  of avoiding the negative effects of light later in the day
*  and at night, then you want that red light
*  to be very, very dim.
*  Certainly much dimmer than is
*  on most of those commercial products.
*  Now, do you need red lights?
*  No, although red lights are rather convenient
*  because you can see pretty well with them on,
*  but if they're dim, they won't wake up the circadian clock.
*  They won't have this dopamine disrupting thing
*  that we talked about in the previous podcast.
*  Okay, a huge number of people asked me
*  about light through windows.
*  Setting your circadian clock
*  with sunlight coming through a window
*  is gonna take 50 to 100 times longer.
*  You can download the free app Light Meter.
*  You can have a bright day outside or some sunlight.
*  Hold up that app, take a picture.
*  It'll tell you how many lux are in that environment.
*  Now close the window.
*  And if you want, close the screen or don't open the screen.
*  You can do all sorts of experiments.
*  You'll see that it will at least half the amount of lux.
*  And it doesn't scale linearly,
*  meaning let's say I get 10,000 lux outside,
*  5,000 looking out through an open window,
*  and then I close the window and it's 2,500 lux.
*  It does not mean that you just need to view that sunlight
*  for twice as long if it's half as many lux, okay?
*  It's not like 2,500 lux means you need to look
*  for 10 minutes and 5,000 lux means you look for five minutes.
*  It doesn't scale that way
*  just because the biology doesn't work that way.
*  Best thing to do is to get outside if you can.
*  If you can't, next best thing to do
*  is to keep that window open.
*  It is perfectly fine to wear prescription lenses
*  and contacts.
*  Why is it okay to wear prescription lenses and contacts
*  when those are glass also,
*  but looking through a window diminishes the effect?
*  Well, we should think about this.
*  The lenses that you wear in front of your eyes
*  by prescription or on your eyes are designed
*  to focus the light onto your neural retina.
*  So let's think about why I'm making
*  some of these recommendations
*  because I think it can really empower you
*  with the ability to change your behavior
*  in terms of light viewing and other things,
*  depending on time of year,
*  depending on other lifestyle factors.
*  The important point to understand is that early in the day,
*  your central circadian clocks and all these mechanisms
*  are looking for a lot of light.
*  Okay, I want to talk about seasonal changes
*  in all these things as they relate to mood and metabolism.
*  So as all of you know,
*  the earth spins once every 24 hours on its axis.
*  So part of that day we're bathed in sunlight,
*  depending on where we are.
*  The other half of the day or part of the day
*  we're in darkness.
*  The earth also travels around the sun.
*  365 days is the time that it takes,
*  one year, to travel around that sun.
*  The earth is tilted.
*  It's not perfectly upright.
*  So the earth is tilted on its axis.
*  So depending on where we are in that 365 day journey
*  and depending on where we are in terms of hemisphere,
*  Northern hemisphere, Southern hemisphere,
*  some days of the year are longer than others.
*  Some are very short, some are very long.
*  If you're at the equator,
*  you experience less variation in day length
*  and therefore night length.
*  And if you're closer to the poles,
*  you're going to experience some very long days
*  and you're also going to experience some very short days,
*  depending on which pole you're at
*  and what time of year it is.
*  The simple way to put this is depending on time of year,
*  the days are either getting shorter or getting longer.
*  Now, every cell in your body adjusts its biology
*  according to day length,
*  except your brain, body and cells
*  don't actually know anything about day length.
*  It only knows night length.
*  And here's how it works.
*  Light inhibits melatonin powerfully.
*  If days are long and getting longer,
*  that means melatonin is reduced.
*  If days are getting shorter,
*  that melatonin signal is getting longer.
*  So every cell in your body actually knows external day length
*  and therefore time of year
*  by way of the duration of the melatonin signal.
*  By understanding that light
*  and extended day length inhibit melatonin
*  and melatonin tends to be associated with a more depressed
*  or reduced functioning of these kind of activity,
*  driving and mood elevating signals
*  and understanding that you have some control over melatonin
*  by way of light, including sunlight,
*  but also artificial light,
*  that should empower you, I believe,
*  to make the adjustments that if you're feeling low,
*  you might ask, how much light am I getting?
*  When am I getting that light?
*  Because sleep is also important for restoring mood, right?
*  So you need sleep.
*  You can't just crush melatonin across the board
*  and expect to feel good
*  because then you're not going to fall asleep and stay asleep.
*  Melatonin, not incidentally comes from,
*  is synthesized from serotonin.
*  Serotonin is a neurotransmitter
*  that is associated with feelings of wellbeing
*  provided to proper levels,
*  but wellbeing of a particular kind,
*  wellbeing associated with quiescence and calm
*  and the feeling that we have enough resources
*  in our immediate kind of conditions.
*  It's the kind of thing that comes from a good meal
*  or sitting down with friends or holding a loved one
*  or conversing with somebody that you really bond with.
*  Serotonin does not stimulate action.
*  It tends to stimulate stillness.
*  Very different than the neuromodulator dopamine,
*  which is a reward feel-good neuromodulator
*  that stimulates action.
*  And actually dopamine is the precursor to epinephrine,
*  to adrenaline, which actually puts us into action.
*  It's actually made from dopamine, right?
*  So you can start to think about light as a signal
*  that is very powerful for modulating things
*  like sleep and wakefulness,
*  but also serotonin levels, melatonin levels.
*  And I talked about this previously,
*  but I'll mention once more
*  that light in the middle of the night reduces dopamine levels
*  to the point where it can start causing problems
*  with learning and memory and mood.
*  That's one powerful reason to avoid bright light
*  in the middle of the night.
*  Throughout this podcast and in previous episodes,
*  I've been mentioning neuromodulators,
*  things like serotonin and dopamine,
*  which tend to bias certain brain circuits
*  and things in our body to happen
*  and certain brain circuits
*  and things in our body not to happen.
*  One of the ones I've mentioned numerous times is epinephrine,
*  which is a neuromodulator that tends to put us into action,
*  make us want to move.
*  In fact, when it's released in high amounts
*  in our brain and body, it can lead to what we call stress
*  or the feeling of being stressed.
*  Several people asked me,
*  what's the difference between epinephrine and adrenaline?
*  Adrenaline is secreted from the adrenal glands,
*  which sit right above our kidneys.
*  Epinephrine is the exact same molecule,
*  except that it's released within the brain.
*  Epinephrine and adrenaline are basically the same thing,
*  and they tend to stimulate agitation
*  and the desire to move.
*  Got a lot of questions about exercise.
*  What forms of exercise are best for sleeping well?
*  When should I exercise, et cetera?
*  There are basically two forms of exercise
*  that we can talk about, although of course,
*  I realize there are many different forms of exercise.
*  There's much more nuance to this,
*  but we can talk about cardiovascular exercise
*  where the idea is to repeat a movement
*  over and over and over continuously.
*  So that'd be like running, biking, rowing,
*  cycling, this kind of thing.
*  Or there's resistance exercise
*  where you're moving, lifting, presumably putting down also.
*  Things of progressively heavier and heavier weight
*  that you couldn't do continuously for 30 minutes.
*  Now you will see some places aerobic exercise
*  best done in the morning
*  and weight training is best done in the afternoon.
*  I think there's far more individual variation than that.
*  I think there are, however, a couple of windows
*  that the exercise science literature
*  and the circadian literature points to
*  as windows related to body temperature
*  in which performance is optimized,
*  injury is reduced, and so on.
*  And those tend to be 30 minutes after waking,
*  three hours after waking,
*  and the later afternoon, usually 11 hours after waking,
*  which is when temperature tends to peak.
*  A note about working out first thing in the morning.
*  Last time we talked about non-photic phase shifts.
*  If you exercise first thing in the morning,
*  your body will start to develop an anticipatory circuit.
*  There's actually plasticity in these circadian circuits
*  that will lead you to want to wake up
*  at the particular time that you exercised
*  the previous three or four days.
*  So that can be a powerful tool,
*  but you still want to get light exposure
*  because it turns out that light and exercise converged
*  to give an even bigger wake-up signal to the brain and body.
*  So you might want to think about that.
*  Some people find if they exercise late in the day,
*  they have trouble sleeping.
*  In general, intense exercise does that,
*  whereas the kind of lower intensity exercise doesn't.
*  Many of your questions were about neural plasticity,
*  which is the brain and nervous system's ability to change
*  in response to experience.
*  There was a question that asked whether or not
*  these really deep biological mechanisms
*  around wakefulness, time of waking, sleep, et cetera,
*  were subject to neural plasticity, and indeed they are.
*  Some of that plasticity is short-term
*  and some of it is more long-term.
*  There's a really good analogy here,
*  which is if you happen to eat on a very tight schedule
*  where every day, say at 8 a.m., noon, and 7 p.m.
*  is when you eat your food, not suggesting you do this,
*  but let's say you were to do that for a couple days.
*  After a few days, you would start to anticipate
*  those meal times where, no matter where you were
*  in the world, no matter what was going on in your life,
*  about five to 10 minutes before those meal times,
*  you would start to feel hungry and even a little agitated,
*  which is your body's way of trying
*  to get you to forage for food.
*  And that's because of some peptide signals
*  that come from the periphery from your body,
*  things like hypocretin orexin that signal
*  to the hypothalamus and brainstem to make you active
*  and alert and look for food and feel hungry.
*  So there's kind of an anticipatory circuit
*  that's a chemical circuit, but eventually over time,
*  the neurons, the neural circuits
*  that control hypocretin orexin would get tuned
*  to the neural circuits that are involved in eating
*  and maybe even smell and taste
*  to create a kind of eating circuit
*  that's unique to your pattern, to your rhythms.
*  The same thing is true for these waking and exercise
*  and other schedules, including ultradian schedules.
*  If you wake up in the morning
*  and start getting your sunlight,
*  you start exercising in the morning
*  or you exercise in the afternoon,
*  pretty soon your body will start to anticipate that
*  and start to secrete hormones and other signals
*  that prepare your body for the ensuing activity
*  of waking up or going to sleep.
*  So if you get onto a pattern or a rhythm,
*  even if that rhythm isn't down to the minute,
*  you'll find that there's plasticity in these circuits
*  and it becomes easier to wake up early if that's your thing
*  or exercise at a particular day if that's your thing.
*  That's the beauty of neuroplasticity.
*  A number of people ask, what can I do to increase plasticity?
*  And that really comes in two forms.
*  There's plasticity that we can access in sleep
*  to improve rates of learning and depth of learning
*  from the previous day or so.
*  And there's this NSDR, non-sleep deep rest
*  that can be done without sleeping
*  to improve rates of learning and depth of retention, et cetera.
*  So let's consider those both
*  and you can incorporate these protocols if you like.
*  Again, these are based on quality peer-reviewed studies.
*  First, let's talk about learning in sleep.
*  This is based on some work
*  that I'll provide the reference for
*  that was published in the journal, Science.
*  Excellent journal.
*  Matt Walker also talks about some of these studies
*  done by others in his book, Why We Sleep.
*  These studies, just to remind you,
*  are structured the following way.
*  An individual is brought into a laboratory,
*  does a spatial memory task.
*  So there tends to be a screen
*  with a bunch of different objects popping up on the screen
*  in different locations.
*  So it might be a bulldog's face, that might be a cat,
*  then it might be an apple,
*  then it might be a pen in different locations.
*  And that sounds trivially easy,
*  but with time you can imagine it gets pretty tough
*  to come back a day later and remember
*  if something presented in a given location
*  was something you've seen before
*  and whether or not it was presented in that location
*  or a different location.
*  If you had enough objects and changed the locations enough,
*  this can actually be quite difficult.
*  In this study, the subjects
*  either just went through the experiment
*  or a particular odor was released into the room
*  while they were learning
*  or a tone was played in the room while they were learning.
*  And then during the sleep of those subjects
*  the following night and the following night,
*  this was done repeatedly for several nights,
*  the same odor or tone was played
*  while the subjects were sleeping.
*  They did this in different stages of sleep,
*  non-REM sleep and rapid eye movement sleep, REM sleep.
*  They did this with just the tone in sleep.
*  If the subjects had had the odor, but not the tone,
*  they did it with putting the tone,
*  if they had the odor while learning.
*  So basically all the controls,
*  all the things you'd want to see done
*  to make sure that it wasn't some indirect effect,
*  some modulatory effect, okay?
*  And what they found was that providing the same stimulus,
*  the odor, if they smelled an odor or a tone,
*  if the subjects heard a tone while learning,
*  if they just delivered that odor or tone
*  while the subject slept, rates of learning
*  and retention of information was significantly greater.
*  This is pretty cool.
*  What this means that you can cue the subconscious brain,
*  the asleep brain to learn particular things better
*  and faster.
*  So how might you implement this?
*  Well, you could play with this if you want.
*  I don't see any real challenge to this
*  provided the odor is a safe one and it doesn't wake you up
*  and the tone is a safe one and doesn't wake you up.
*  You could do this by having a metronome, for instance,
*  while learning something, playing in the background
*  or particular music,
*  and then have that very faintly while you sleep.
*  So you could apply this if you like and try this.
*  The other form of neuroplasticity
*  is not the neuroplasticity that you're amplifying
*  by listening to tones or smelling odors
*  but the neuroplasticity that you can access
*  with non-sleep deep rest.
*  So NSDR, non-sleep deep rest,
*  as well as short 20 minute naps,
*  which are very close to non-sleep deep rest
*  because people rarely drop into deep states of sleep
*  during short naps unless they're very sleep deprived.
*  NSDR has been shown to increase rates of learning
*  when done for 20 minute bouts
*  to match an approximately 90 minute bout of learning.
*  So what am I talking about?
*  90 minute cycles are these Ultradian cycles
*  that I've talked about previously.
*  And we tend to learn very well
*  by taking a 90 minute cycle,
*  transitioning into some focus mode early in the cycle
*  when it's hard to focus and then deep focus and learning
*  feels almost like agitation and strain.
*  And then by the end of that 90 minute cycle,
*  it becomes very hard to maintain focus
*  and learn more information.
*  There's a study published in Cell Reports last year,
*  great journal, excellent paper,
*  showing that 20 minute naps or light sleep
*  of the sort of non-sleep deep rest
*  taken immediately after or close to,
*  it doesn't have to be immediately
*  after you finished the last sentence of learning
*  or whatever it is or bar of music.
*  But a couple of minutes after transitioning
*  to a period of non-sleep deep rest
*  where you're turning off the analysis of duration,
*  path and outcome has been shown to accelerate learning
*  to a significant degree, both the amount of information
*  and the retention of that information.
*  So that's pretty cool because this is a cost-free,
*  drug-free way of accelerating learning
*  without having to get more sleep,
*  but simply by introducing these 20 minute bouts.
*  I would encourage people if they want to try this
*  to consider the 20 minutes per every 90 minutes
*  of ultradian learning cycle,
*  which brings us to the next thing about learning
*  and plasticity, which is nootropics, AKA smart drugs.
*  This is a big topic that Sai was a sigh of concern
*  about how to address nootropics in a thorough enough,
*  but thoughtful enough way.
*  There are elements to learning
*  that we've discussed here before that are very concrete.
*  Things like the ability to focus
*  and put the blinders on to everything else that's happening
*  around you and in your head, mainly, right?
*  Distractions about things you should be doing,
*  could be doing, or might be doing
*  and focus on what you need to do.
*  And then that's required for triggering
*  the acetylcholine neuromodulator
*  that will then allow you to highlight
*  the particular synapses that will then later change in sleep.
*  So nootropic allows you to bypass the need
*  for sleep and deep rest.
*  That's important to understand.
*  Right now, most nootropics tend to bundle
*  a bunch of things together.
*  Most of them include some form of stimulant, caffeine.
*  You can't just ingest more stimulant to be more focused.
*  It doesn't work that way.
*  Most nootropics also include things that increase
*  or are designed to increase acetylcholine,
*  things like alpha GPC and other things of that sort.
*  And indeed there's some evidence
*  that they can increase acetylcholine.
*  So we need the focus component.
*  We need the alertness component.
*  The alertness component comes from epinephrine,
*  traditionally from caffeine stimulation,
*  the acetylcholine stimulation,
*  traditionally comes from choline donors or alpha GPC,
*  things of that sort.
*  And then you would want to have some sort of off switch
*  because anything that's going to really stimulate
*  your alertness that then provides a crash,
*  that crash is not a crash into the deep kind
*  of restful slumber that you would want for learning.
*  It's a crash into the kind of,
*  let's just call it lopsided sleep,
*  meaning it's deep sleep, but it lacks certain spindles
*  and other elements of the physiology sleep spindles
*  that really engage the learning process
*  and the reconfiguration of synapses.
*  So right now, my stance on nootropics is that maybe,
*  maybe for occasional use, provided it's safe for you,
*  I'm not recommending it, but in general,
*  it tends to use more of a shotgun approach
*  than is probably going to be useful for learning
*  and memory in the long run.
*  Okay, I'd like to continue by talking about the role
*  of temperature in sleep, accessing sleep,
*  staying asleep and wakefulness.
*  Temperature is super interesting as it relates
*  to circadian rhythms and wakefulness and sleep.
*  First, let's take a look at what's happening
*  to our body temperature across each 24-hour cycle.
*  In general, our temperature tends to be lowest
*  right around 4 a.m. and starts creeping up
*  around 6 a.m., 8 a.m. and peaks sometime
*  between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m.
*  There's also an important way
*  in which temperature matches day length.
*  In general, as days get longer, it tends to be hotter out.
*  Not always, but in general, that's the way it is.
*  And as days get shorter, it tends to be colder outside.
*  So temperature and day length are also linked.
*  Metabolically, they're linked.
*  Biologically, they're linked, excuse me.
*  And atmospherically, they're linked
*  for the reasons that we talked about before
*  about duration of day length
*  and other climate features and so forth.
*  So one of the most powerful things
*  about setting your circadian rhythm properly
*  is that your temperature will start to fall
*  into a regular rhythm, and that temperature
*  has a very strong effect on things like metabolism
*  and when you will feel most willing
*  and interested in exercising.
*  Typically, the willingness to exercise
*  and engage in any kind of activity, mental or physical,
*  is going to be when that rise in temperature is steepest,
*  when the slope of that line is greatest.
*  That's why 30 minutes after waking
*  is one of those key windows,
*  as well as three hours after waking,
*  and then when temperature actually peaks,
*  which is generally, generally,
*  about 11 hours after waking.
*  So this is why we say that temperature
*  and circadian rhythm are linked,
*  but they're actually even more linked than that.
*  We've talked before about how light enters the eye,
*  triggers activation of these melanopsin cells,
*  which then triggers activation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus,
*  the master circadian clock.
*  And then I always say the master circadian clock
*  informs all the cells and tissues of your body
*  and puts them into a nice cohesive rhythm.
*  But what I've never answered
*  was how it actually puts them into that rhythm.
*  And it does it two ways.
*  One is it secretes a peptide.
*  A peptide is just a little protein
*  that floats through the bloodstream
*  and signals to the cells.
*  But the other way is it synchronizes the temperature
*  under which those cells exist.
*  So temperature is actually the effector
*  of the circadian rhythm.
*  Nowadays, there's some interest in cold showers and ice baths.
*  Getting into an ice bath is very interesting
*  because you have a rebound increase in thermogenesis.
*  Now you should know from the previous episode
*  that as that temperature increases,
*  it will shift your circadian rhythm
*  and which direction it shifts your circadian rhythm
*  will depend on whether or not you're doing it
*  during the daytime or late in the day.
*  If you do it after 8 p.m.,
*  it's going to make your day longer, right?
*  Because your body and your central clocks
*  are used to temperature going up early in the day
*  and throughout the day and peaking in the afternoon.
*  If you then increase that further
*  or you simply increase it over its baseline at 8 p.m.
*  after temperature was already falling,
*  even if it's just by a half a degree or a couple of degrees,
*  or you do that with exercise,
*  it doesn't have to be with the ice bath.
*  You are extending, you are shifting forward,
*  you are phase delaying your clock.
*  You're convincing your clock
*  and therefore the rest of your body
*  that the day is still going, right?
*  You're giving it the perception,
*  the cellular and physiological perception
*  that the day is getting longer
*  and you will want to naturally stay up later
*  and wake up later.
*  So for those of you that are having trouble getting up,
*  and this is going to almost sound laughable,
*  but a cold shower first thing in the morning
*  will wake you up,
*  but that's waking you up in the short term
*  because of a different mechanism,
*  which I'll talk about in a moment,
*  but it also is shifting your clock.
*  It's phase advancing your clock
*  in a way that makes you more likely
*  to get up earlier the next day.
*  It's going to make you want to wake up
*  about half hour to an hour earlier the next day
*  than you normally would.
*  Whereas if you do it while your temperature is falling,
*  it will tend to delay and make your body perceive
*  as if the day is getting longer.
*  But temperature is again,
*  it's not just one tool to manipulate wake up time
*  and circadian rhythm and metabolism.
*  It is the effector.
*  It is the way that the central circadian clock
*  impacts all the cells and tissues of your body.
*  Light is the trigger.
*  The suprachiasmatic nucleus is the master circadian clock
*  that mediates all these changes,
*  also influenced by non-photic influence
*  like exercise and feeding and things of that sort.
*  But temperature is the effector.
*  Now, you can also shift your circadian rhythm with eating.
*  When you travel and you land in a new location
*  and your schedule is inverted 12 hours,
*  one way that we know you can shift your rhythm more quickly
*  is to get onto the local meal schedule.
*  Now that probably has to do with two effects.
*  One are changes in temperature
*  and eating induced increases in body temperature.
*  Now you should understand why that would work.
*  As well as eating has this anticipatory secretion
*  of hypercretinorexin that I talked about earlier.
*  Many people ask questions about food and neurotransmitters
*  and how those relate to sleep, wakefulness and mood,
*  which is essentially 25 hours of content for me to cover.
*  But I'm going to try and distill out
*  the most common questions.
*  We've talked a lot about neuromodulators
*  like dopamine acetylcholine and norepinephrine.
*  You may notice in those discussions
*  that the precursors to say serotonin is tryptophan.
*  Tryptophan actually comes from the diet.
*  It comes from the foods that we eat.
*  Tyrosine is the precursor to dopamine.
*  It comes from the foods that we eat.
*  And then once we ingest them,
*  those compounds circulate to a variety
*  of different cells and tissues.
*  But it is true that our food
*  and the particular foods we can influence
*  things like neuromodulator levels to some extent.
*  Nuts and meats in particular, red meats,
*  tend to be rich in things like tyrosine.
*  That tells you right there that because tyrosine
*  is the precursor of dopamine
*  and dopamine is the precursor of norepinephrine
*  and epinephrine, that those foods tend to lend themselves
*  toward the production of dopamine and epinephrine
*  and the sorts of things that are associated
*  with wakefulness.
*  Now, of course, the volume of food that we eat
*  also impacts our wakefulness.
*  We eat a lot of anything, whether or not it's rib-eye,
*  steaks, rice, or cardboard, please don't eat cardboard.
*  Your stomach, if it's very distended,
*  will draw a lot of blood into your gut
*  and you will divert blood from other tissues
*  and you'll become sleepy.
*  So it's not just about food content,
*  it's also about food volume, all right?
*  Fasting states generally are associated
*  with more alertness, epinephrine and so forth.
*  And fed states are generally associated
*  with more quiescence and relaxation, serotonin
*  and the kind of things that lend themselves more
*  towards sleep and less toward alertness.
*  And fed states are generally associated
*  with more quiescence and relaxation, serotonin
*  and the kind of things that lend themselves more
*  towards sleep and less toward alertness.
*  There are a couple effects of food that are independent,
*  or I should say a couple effects of eating,
*  because the food won't do it
*  when it's sitting across the table,
*  but of eating that are powerful for modulating
*  circadian rhythm, wakefulness, et cetera.
*  And that's because every time we eat,
*  we get eating-induced thermogenesis,
*  regardless of what we eat.
*  And now you know from the discussion about temperature
*  that if you're eating early in the day,
*  you're tending to shift your rhythm earlier
*  so that you'll want to wake up earlier the next day
*  if you're eating very late in the day,
*  even if you can fall asleep after that,
*  there's a tendency for you to want to sleep later
*  the next day.
*  So as we finish up, I just want to offer you the opportunity
*  to do an experiment.
*  It might be interesting, just a suggestion,
*  to write down for each day when you went outside
*  to get sunlight and when you did that relative to waking.
*  And then you might just take note of when you exercised
*  and you might note when you might've felt chilled or cold
*  if you do, or you might've felt particularly hot,
*  or if you woke up in the middle of the night
*  when you felt particularly hot.
*  And then the last thing you might want to do
*  is just write down if and when you did
*  a non-sleep deep rest protocol, NSDR protocol,
*  anything that you're using to deliberately
*  teach your nervous system how to go from more alertness
*  to more calmness in the waking state.
*  By doing this, you can start to reveal
*  some really interesting patterns.
*  It's really about taking the patterns of behaviors
*  of waking and light viewing and eating and exercise
*  and superimposing that on what you're learning
*  in this podcast and elsewhere, of course,
*  and what you already know,
*  and trying to see where certain problems
*  or pain points might be arising.
*  Maybe you start to find that using cold exposure
*  early in the day is great for you, but using it late,
*  if it's too late in the day, that's not great.
*  Or if you're into the sauna or even like some people,
*  including myself, if I take a hot shower,
*  sit in a hot tub or a sauna late at night,
*  well, then I get a compensatory decrease
*  in body temperature and I sleep great,
*  provided I hydrate well enough,
*  because that can be kind of a dehydrating thing
*  to sit in hot conditions.
*  But if I do the sauna early in the day,
*  unless I exercise immediately afterward,
*  then I tend to get the temperature drop, which makes sense,
*  because we can get in the sauna, you get vasodilation,
*  you throw off a lot of heat,
*  and then you generally get a compensatory drop
*  in temperature.
*  If you do that early in the day,
*  that's right about the time that that temperature
*  is trying to entrain the circadian clocks of your body.
*  So I just encourage you to start becoming scientists
*  of your own physiology, of your own brain and body,
*  and seeing how the various tools that you may or may not
*  be using are affecting your patterns of sleep,
*  your patterns of attention and wakefulness.
*  It's vitally important that if you do this,
*  that you know that it's not about trying to get
*  onto an extremely rigid schedule.
*  It's really about trying to identify variables
*  that are most powerful for you,
*  and that push you in the direction that you want to go,
*  and changing the variables that are pushing your body
*  and your mind in the directions that you don't want to go.
*  Self-experimentation is something
*  that should be done slowly, carefully.
*  You don't want to be reckless about this.
*  And this is where I would say manipulating one
*  or two variables at a time is really going to be best,
*  as opposed to changing a dozen things all at once,
*  to really identify what it is that's most powerful for you.
*  And above all, thank you for your interest in science.
