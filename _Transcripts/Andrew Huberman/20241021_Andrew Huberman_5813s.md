Video Description: In this episode, I explain what microplastics are, their prevalence in the human body and environment, and their common sources, as well as their potential negative health impacts. I provide practical strategies for limiting exposure to microplastics, nanoplastics, and endocrine disruptors such as bisphenol-A (BPA), bisphenol-S (BPS), phthalates, and PFAS ("forever chemicals"). Additionally, I discuss methods to enhance the body's detoxification and excretion of microplastics.

By the end of this episode, you will have a clear understanding of the modern science of microplastics and their impact on human biology, along with actionable steps to minimize exposure and accumulation in the brain and body.

# The Effects of Microplastics on Your Health & How to Reduce Them
**Andrew Huberman:** [October 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfRtLI6cJrk)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
*  where we discuss science
*  and science-based tools for everyday life.
*  I'm Andrew Huberman,
*  and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
*  at Stanford School of Medicine.
*  Today, we are discussing microplastics.
*  Microplastics are an extremely interesting
*  and important topic that everyone should know about.
*  And the reason is microplastics are indeed everywhere.
*  They are in the air.
*  They are in beverages we consume.
*  They are lining the inside of soup cans.
*  They are lining the inside of paper cups
*  made to hold hot water, coffee, and tea.
*  And there are a lot of animal data,
*  and indeed some human data,
*  showing that microplastics,
*  which consist of particles of different sizes,
*  can be very detrimental to our health.
*  At the same time, it's important to realize that as of now,
*  we don't have any causal data linking microplastics
*  to specific human diseases.
*  That said, there's a lot of correlative data,
*  and today we are going to review those correlative data.
*  And most importantly, we are going to discuss
*  the various things that we can each and all do
*  to limit our exposure to microplastics,
*  or at least to facilitate the removal of microplastics
*  from our body.
*  Because, as we'll soon discuss,
*  you have microplastics in essentially every organ
*  and tissue of your body right now.
*  And you are constantly being bombarded with microplastics.
*  So the challenge for me, and indeed for you as well,
*  is to frame this topic of microplastics accurately.
*  It's important that we understand they are out there,
*  they are in us,
*  and indeed they can cause serious issues for our health.
*  However, we also need to take agency.
*  We need to understand how we can limit
*  what's called the bioaccumulation of microplastics
*  in our organs and tissues.
*  And I don't want to be alarmist.
*  Today's episode is not about getting you to be petrified
*  or about developing some sort of hypochondriasis
*  about microplastics.
*  It's designed to inform you about what they are,
*  where they exist,
*  where they exist in particularly high amounts,
*  and the things that you can do
*  to limit their impact on your biology.
*  Because I think it's fair to say
*  that we are not going to rid the earth of microplastics.
*  They are just too pervasive.
*  Now, the one caveat is that there are certain populations
*  of people, in particular, people that are pregnant
*  or people that have young children
*  and those young children themselves,
*  that should really strive
*  to limit their exposure to microplastics.
*  So by the end of today's episode,
*  you can be confident that you'll understand a lot
*  about what microplastics are,
*  the impact that they are currently having,
*  some of the potential impact
*  that people are starting to investigate,
*  and ways that you can limit their negative impact
*  on your brain and bodily health.
*  Before you begin, I'd like to emphasize
*  that this podcast is separate from my teaching
*  and research roles at Stanford.
*  It is, however, part of my desire and effort
*  to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
*  and science-related tools to the general public.
*  In keeping with that theme,
*  I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
*  Our first sponsor is Element.
*  Element is an electrolyte drink
*  that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
*  That means the electrolytes,
*  sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
*  in the correct ratios, but no sugar.
*  Now, I and others on the podcast have talked a lot
*  about the critical importance of hydration
*  for proper brain and bodily function.
*  Research shows that even a slight degree of dehydration
*  can really diminish cognitive and physical performance.
*  It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes
*  in order for your body and brain to function at their best.
*  The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
*  are critical for the functioning of all the cells
*  in your body, especially your neurons or nerve cells.
*  To make sure that I'm getting proper amounts
*  of hydration in electrolytes,
*  I dissolve one packet of element
*  in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
*  when I wake up in the morning,
*  and I drink that basically first thing in the morning.
*  I also drink element dissolved in water
*  during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing,
*  especially on hot days if I'm sweating a lot
*  and losing water and electrolytes.
*  Element has a lot of different
*  great tasting flavors of Element.
*  My favorite is the watermelon,
*  although I also confess I like the raspberry
*  and the citrus.
*  Basically, I like all the flavors of Element.
*  If you'd like to try Element,
*  you can go to drinkelement.com slash Huberman,
*  spelled drinklmnt.com slash Huberman,
*  to claim a free element sample pack
*  with the purchase of any Element drink mix.
*  Again, that's drinkelement.com slash Huberman
*  to claim a free sample pack.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by BetterHelp.
*  BetterHelp offers professional therapy
*  with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online.
*  Now, I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years.
*  Initially, I didn't have a choice.
*  It was a condition of being allowed to stay in high school,
*  but pretty soon I realized that therapy
*  is an extremely important component to overall health.
*  In fact, I consider doing regular therapy
*  just as important as getting regular exercise,
*  including cardiovascular exercise
*  and resistance training exercise,
*  which of course I also do every week.
*  Now, there are essentially three things
*  that Great Therapy provides.
*  First, it provides a good rapport with somebody
*  that you can really trust and talk to
*  about any and all issues that concern you.
*  Second of all, Great Therapy provides support
*  in the form of emotional support,
*  but also directed guidance, the do's and the not to do's.
*  And third, expert therapy can help you arrive
*  at useful insights that you would not have arrived
*  otherwise, insights that allow you to do better,
*  not just in your emotional life, in your relationship life,
*  but also the relationship to yourself
*  and your professional life and all sorts of career goals.
*  With BetterHelp, they make it very easy
*  to find an expert therapist
*  with whom you can really resonate with
*  and provide you with these three benefits that I described.
*  If you'd like to try BetterHelp,

*  Again, that's betterhelp.com slash Huberman.
*  Okay, let's talk about microplastics.
*  What are microplastics?
*  Microplastics, as the name suggests,
*  are little itty bitty bits of plastic.
*  How itty bitty?
*  Well, microplastics range in size from one micron,
*  which is one one thousandth of a millimeter,
*  all the way up to five millimeters in diameter.
*  Okay, so anything in that size range
*  is considered a microplastic.
*  Anything smaller than that,
*  so anything smaller than one micron in diameter,
*  one one thousandth of a millimeter in diameter
*  is considered a nanoplastic.
*  And indeed there are lots of microplastics
*  floating around in the air.
*  There are lots of nanoplastics floating around in the air.
*  There's lots of both of those things in the ocean.
*  There are a lot of those things in food,
*  especially packaged food.
*  There are a lot of those things lining cups.
*  There are a lot of those things
*  in everything that we consume essentially.
*  So what does it mean to have all these microplastics
*  and nanoplastics floating around in our environment
*  and going into our body through fluids and foods, et cetera?
*  Well, there is some serious concern
*  because these microplastics potentially
*  can disrupt cellular health, organ health,
*  and could potentially lead to certain forms of disease.
*  We'll talk about the ways they could potentially do that.
*  However, I want to also emphasize
*  that your body is incredibly good
*  at dealing with foreign invaders.
*  It's very good at getting rid of stuff
*  that isn't good for it.
*  However, microplastics and nanoplastics
*  have been shown to lodge within specific tissues
*  and stay there for long periods of time.
*  So you'll notice during today's episode,
*  I'm going to go back and forth
*  between the stuff that's really scary
*  and then reassuring you that we're not sure
*  whether or not we need to be that scared
*  about these microplastics and nanoplastics yet.
*  Okay, what I want to do is give you the evidence
*  so you can decide how much effort you put into
*  limiting your exposure to these microplastics
*  and nanoplastics and how much effort you put into
*  trying to rid your body of them.
*  Okay, I'm not here to paint the picture one way or the other
*  because frankly, the data just don't line up
*  with one argument or the other,
*  that they're extremely dangerous
*  or that they're nothing to worry about.
*  Let me give you an example of something
*  that you might've heard in the media
*  and on recent podcasts out there that's very scary.
*  The argument based on what seemed to be
*  a pretty high quality publication that you may have heard
*  is that every single week,
*  we ingest up to a credit card's worth
*  of microplastics and nanoplastics.
*  Okay, you might've seen that in headlines
*  and in other podcasts.
*  And indeed, there was a paper arguing that.
*  However, a more recent paper looked at
*  the quantitative analysis they used,
*  used a different quantitative analysis
*  and claimed that they vastly overestimated
*  the amount of plastic that we ingest every week.
*  What do I mean by vastly overestimated?
*  This newer analysis of the same data claims
*  that the credit card's worth of plastic
*  that it was argued we consume every week,
*  well, that was an overestimate by a million fold.
*  And in fact, it would take 23,000 years
*  to consume enough plastic to lead to that credit card's
*  worth of plastic in our bodies.
*  Okay, so now we have very discrepant data
*  or rather we have very discrepant analysis of the same data.
*  So you're starting to get a picture
*  of just how confusing this whole field is,
*  but we're gonna parse it a little bit further
*  by saying that it's also very clear
*  that microplastics and nanoplastics are everywhere.
*  Okay, they're just everywhere you look.
*  In fact, if I were a PhD advisor
*  for somebody in toxicology or a PhD advisor
*  for somebody in environmental science,
*  and they needed to have a surefire publication,
*  I'd probably suggest that they work on microplastics
*  and go out there and try and find
*  yet another source of microplastics
*  and use a better analysis for instance, okay?
*  Doing a graduate thesis isn't just
*  about getting a publication,
*  but what I'm trying to refer to here
*  is that wherever people look for microplastics,
*  they find them.
*  This is true in our environment
*  and this is true in food, this is true in water,
*  and this is also true for our tissues.
*  So in the last couple of years,
*  there's been an explosion in the number
*  of scientific studies exploring
*  which tissues of the human body,
*  so not just animal models,
*  but the human body contain microplastics and nanoplastics.
*  Okay, so by examining postmortem tissues,
*  that is tissues from people who are deceased,
*  it's been discovered that there are microplastics
*  and nanoplastics lodged in the brain.
*  So if you take the brain of a deceased adult human,
*  what you find is that they have about 0.5%
*  of the total weight of the brain from microplastics.
*  So this is about a teaspoon of salt
*  or sugar's worth of microplastics,
*  might not seem like much,
*  but if you think about how little neurons are,
*  a typical neuron will have a cell body,
*  this is the area that contains the nucleus
*  with all the DNA and so forth,
*  that cell bodies of neurons vary in size tremendously,
*  they can be as small as five to eight microns across,
*  to as much as, gosh, I've seen some neurons
*  down the microscope that are 50 microns,
*  I've seen some that are 100 microns across,
*  it depends where you look in the nervous system.
*  Okay, so if you start to think about a half teaspoon
*  of powder of microplastics and nanoplastics,
*  that's a lot of microplastics and nanoplastics
*  that could be distributed in lots of different places
*  in the brain, and a little bit later,
*  we'll talk about what the potential impact is
*  of these microplastics and nanoplastics
*  on the function of particular types of neurons
*  that may impact things
*  like neurodevelopmental trajectories, okay?
*  The argument has been made, I'm not making this argument,
*  but the argument has been made that microplastics
*  and nanoplastics may correlate with things like autism,
*  may correlate with things like
*  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
*  I don't actually believe that the data there
*  are strong enough to make those arguments at all.
*  However, I will tell you that the presence of microplastics
*  and nanoplastics in the brains that is post-mortem tissue,
*  okay, so deceased people taking the brain,
*  chopping up the brain, looking at down the microscope
*  and seeing microplastics,
*  and then quantifying the amount of microplastics
*  in different compartments of the brain
*  and distributed across the brain,
*  that is concerning to me in the sense
*  that there's enough of it in there,
*  and the function of neurons in the nervous system
*  is precise enough that you could imagine,
*  given that these microplastics and nanoplastics
*  are lodged in particular categories of neurons
*  that do in fact impact things like reward and motivation,
*  things like movement, et cetera,
*  that they could be impacting
*  the function of the nervous system,
*  but there's no direct causal relationship,
*  at least not in humans.
*  There's some interesting data in animal models.
*  We'll get back to that a little bit later.
*  So there's microplastics and nanoplastics in brain,
*  you'll find microplastics and nanoplastics
*  in other tissues that have a blood organ barrier.
*  What do I mean by that?
*  Well, the brain is encapsulated in the so-called BBB,
*  the blood brain barrier,
*  and that's because your brain tissue,
*  because it doesn't turn over across the lifespan,
*  you don't produce many new neurons.
*  There are a few places you produce new neurons
*  like the olfactory bulb, the dentate gyrus,
*  or the hippocampus, a few places,
*  but these are far and few between.
*  Most of your brain tissue that you're born with
*  is the brain tissue that you're going to die with,
*  provided you don't lose that brain tissue
*  through the course of your lifespan,
*  through a head injury or something like that.
*  The neurons you have when you are born
*  actually are far more numerous
*  than the neurons you have at the time when you die.
*  This is important and it's one of the reasons
*  we have a blood brain barrier.
*  Nature is very smart.
*  It designed a barrier so that molecules
*  that might be dangerous to the brain
*  can't enter the brain, and that's what the BBB is for.
*  Microplastics and nanoplastics are making it
*  from the bloodstream into the brain.
*  This is what I mean when I say
*  they can cross the blood brain barrier.
*  Then if we take a step back and we ask ourselves,
*  what are some other tissues in the body
*  that have a very robust barrier from the blood?
*  Because a lot of things get into the blood
*  and that's not necessarily good,
*  but it's not necessarily bad
*  if you can excrete those things, right?
*  We have a lot of detoxification mechanisms
*  that include our liver detoxification, et cetera.
*  But if these particles are getting
*  from the blood into the brain,
*  what are some other tissues that they're getting into
*  that have these thick barriers
*  or these very stringent barriers?
*  As you can imagine, two other tissues
*  that have very stringent blood to organ barriers
*  are the blood testicular barrier.
*  Why would that be?
*  Okay, why would you protect brain?
*  Well, it can't renew.
*  You don't want those neurons
*  to get contaminated with things.
*  So you put a BBB in, a blood brain barrier.
*  You also put a blood testicular barrier in males.
*  Why?
*  Well, that's where the DNA are.
*  That's where the so-called germ cells are.
*  So you don't want things getting into the testicle
*  and mutating the DNA there
*  because then those mutated DNA
*  could be passed on to offspring.
*  Guess what?
*  Microplastics and nanoplastics
*  can cross the blood testicular barrier.
*  And in fact, there was a lot of press this last year
*  about microplastics and nanoplastics being present
*  in every human testicle that was analyzed in,
*  or I should say from post-mortem tissue.
*  Likewise, there's a blood follicle barrier in females.
*  Okay, this is where the eggs come from.
*  And microplastics and nanoplastics
*  can cross the blood follicular barrier.
*  So this is why people are starting to get concerned, right?
*  I suppose we shouldn't be so surprised
*  that we're inhaling microplastics
*  given that they are everywhere.
*  I should mention that there wasn't much plastic around
*  or in use prior to the 1950s.
*  If any of you have ever seen the movie,
*  The Graduate with Dustin Hoffman,
*  this is the only time you'll see somebody driving
*  eastward across the Bay Bridge, all right,
*  from San Francisco toward Berkeley on the top deck.
*  It actually runs in the other direction.
*  They shut down the Bay Bridge.
*  That's in The Graduate.
*  And the other thing that's in The Graduate
*  is this famous scene.
*  If you're old enough like me
*  to remember the movie, The Graduate,
*  Dustin Hoffman's lying in the pool.
*  It's after his graduation.
*  He's lying in the pool.
*  He doesn't really know what he's going to do with his life.
*  And this guy comes up to him and he says,
*  you know, the future is plastics.
*  And it became this kind of famous line or pseudo famous line.
*  Now that movie takes place at a time
*  when plastics were really booming as an industry.
*  And indeed polyethylene, polyurethane,
*  these plastic materials were developed
*  because they were very durable.
*  They were long lasting.
*  In fact, they are not biodegradable.
*  They're not broken down very easily, if at all,
*  and certainly not within biological tissues.
*  These plastics went from essentially non-existent
*  in the 1940s and prior to in pretty much everything
*  involved in manufacturing, okay?
*  Even in different aspects of surgical implants
*  and things of that sort.
*  So plastics are indeed everywhere.
*  And that started in the 1950s,
*  hence that line from The Graduate.
*  So it's not surprising that microplastics and nanoplastics
*  would get into our body, right?
*  If they're everywhere in our environment
*  and we're inhaling them all day,
*  then of course they'll get into our lungs.
*  And then they're small enough
*  they can get into our bloodstream.
*  But as I mentioned, the body has these cleansing systems
*  or these detoxification systems to remove things,
*  but they're not removing the microplastics
*  or at least not all of them
*  from brain, testicle and follicle.
*  And I should point out that microplastics and nanoplastics
*  are also found in all the other tissues of the body.
*  In fact, I don't think there's a single investigation
*  of human tissue or animal tissue for microplastics
*  or nanoplastics where they didn't get a positive result,
*  meaning where they didn't find them in the tissue.
*  You can find them in not just the upper lungs,
*  but in the lower lungs.
*  So they're getting deposited in the lower lungs.
*  You can find them in the bloodstream from a blood draw.
*  You can find them in human placenta
*  and you can find them in what's called the meconium,
*  which is the first stool that a baby takes.
*  This is typically taken within the,
*  or the stool is given, given, taken.
*  It's taken by the doctor.
*  It's actually analyzed for various things.
*  It contains bile and a bunch of other things.
*  It's actually an important indicator
*  of the health of the child.
*  It turns out that this first stool
*  that happens in the first 24 hours or so after birth,
*  when that's been analyzed for microplastics,
*  there too you find microplastics and nanoplastics.
*  And that's really got people concerned
*  because what this means is that microplastics
*  and nanoplastics that mothers are ingesting
*  or that they somehow have lodged in their bodies
*  are making their way to the fetus.
*  Now you could say, well, is it really a problem?
*  Well, a few years ago it was at least concerning enough
*  that BPAs, and we'll talk more about BPAs,
*  bisphenol A, which is a component of microplastics.
*  This is a known endocrine disruptor.
*  It disrupts certain estrogen-like pathways.
*  We'll get into this in a few minutes.
*  Bisphenol A and BPAs were banned from sippy cups in kids
*  and from any food containers for young kids.
*  So the FDA in the United States,
*  and there are European countries as well,
*  had enough data on this or enough concern about this
*  to say, listen, we are going to make it illegal
*  to have BPA-lined sippy cups or food containers
*  for young kids, in part because the BPA is correlated
*  with microplastics and nanoplastics.
*  So what I'm saying here is that the government
*  has taken pretty avid measures to restrict the amount
*  of BPA exposure through microplastics and nanoplastics
*  to young kids, and yet the fetus clearly is being exposed
*  to microplastics and nanoplastics.
*  This is why at the beginning I mentioned,
*  if you are pregnant or if you have young kids
*  or if you are a young kid, you want to go out of your way
*  to limit your exposure to these microplastics
*  and nanoplastics, but if you're an older adult,
*  you probably want to do the same,
*  and we'll talk about ways that you can do that.
*  So I could go on and on about the various tissues
*  besides placenta in your bloodstream, brain, testes,
*  follicle, lower lungs.
*  You can find nanoplastics in the liver.
*  You can find microplastics and nanoplastics
*  in pretty much every tissue that you look for them.
*  The real question is how detrimental
*  are these microplastics and nanoplastics?
*  And then of course, we can talk about
*  where they're coming from specifically
*  in ways that you can control and limit.
*  And when I say control and limit,
*  what we're really talking about here is,
*  yes, trying to limit your exposure to these things.
*  If I were to rattle off the different sources
*  of microplastics and nanoplastics, you would go wide-eyed
*  and you would probably also just say,
*  okay, I surrender, they're truly everywhere.
*  In fact, I'll do that, okay?
*  I can't help but do that.
*  But keep in mind, you do have some control
*  in terms of the end result of these microplastics
*  and nanoplastics on your health.
*  So here I go.
*  Plastic bags, storage containers, bottle caps,
*  rope gear strapping, utensils, cups,
*  floats, coolers, containers, rope, fishing nets, textiles.
*  Sorry, I'm not laughing because it's funny.
*  I'm laughing because it's just pretty much everywhere.
*  Latex paint, coatings, medical devices, automotive parts,
*  tires on the road, degrading,
*  giving off little microplastics into the air,
*  microplastics raining down from the sky, literally.
*  Pipe film containers, laminated safety glass, car windshields.
*  Oh, great, even the car windshield.
*  Drinking bottles, textile fibers, resins, paints,
*  varnish, construction, automotive parts.
*  Okay, so basically everywhere.
*  These things are everywhere.
*  So what are we to do?
*  Well, what we are to do is to limit
*  the long-term accumulation of microplastics
*  and nanoplastics in our system.
*  There are ways that we can limit their introduction
*  to our system, but as long as you're breathing,
*  as long as you're walking around,
*  as long as you're near a road,
*  you are exposed to microplastics.
*  So until there's a huge movement to make better tires
*  that don't degrade as quickly,
*  or to create filters in our home environments
*  that remove the microplastics,
*  which frankly I think both of those things
*  are not reasonable expectations,
*  at least not in this lifetime.
*  Well, until then, what you can do
*  is you can try and limit their entry
*  and accumulation into your body.
*  So rather than list off all the ways that you can limit
*  so-called bioaccumulation of microplastics and nanoplastics,
*  at the beginning or at the end of today's episode,
*  I'm going to intersperse them at times that are relevant
*  to what I just discussed about how microplastics
*  get into our system and the tissues they are lodged in.
*  So I'll tell you right now that a few ways
*  that you can really do yourself a service
*  in limiting your exposure to microplastics
*  is to limit your consumption of water from plastic bottles.
*  Okay, that might seem kind of obvious,
*  but check out these data.
*  This is pretty wild.
*  There was an analysis of the number of microplastic
*  and nanoplastic particles in bottled water,
*  and it was estimated that there were about 30,000
*  of these particles per liter of water, okay?
*  And those data stood for quite a long time.
*  Then imaging techniques for measuring the number
*  of these different particles,
*  in particular the really small nanoparticles,
*  the ones that are less than one micron in diameter,
*  the imaging tools for those improved, okay?
*  And I'll explain a little bit about that in a moment.
*  And there was a paper published
*  in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
*  in 2024 that showed that the amount of nanoplastic
*  in particular, but microplastic and nanoplastics
*  that are present in bottled water
*  was actually vastly underestimated in that previous study.
*  Rather than 30,000 particles per liter,
*  the reanalysis with better methods showed
*  that it was anywhere from 110 all the way
*  up to 400,000 particles per liter.
*  And the average was 240,000 particles per liter.
*  So that means that the amount of microplastics
*  and nanoplastics in bottled water is actually much,
*  much higher than we initially thought.
*  And a very simple way to limit your exposure
*  to microplastics and nanoplastics is
*  to avoid drinking water from plastic bottles,
*  in particular plastic bottles that have been heated up.
*  Now you might say, well,
*  I don't heat up my plastic water bottles, right?
*  But you don't know what happened
*  to those plastic water bottles en route
*  to the store you bought them at
*  or en route to your refrigerator, right?
*  They could have sat in the back of a hot truck.
*  They could have sat in the back of a loading dock,
*  any number of different things.
*  Now, this is not to say that if you drink the occasional water
*  out of a plastic bottle that you're going
*  to harm your health, I'm absolutely not saying that.
*  However, it's pretty clear that there's a lot
*  of microplastics and nanoplastics
*  that are completely avoidable,
*  at least avoidable in terms of your ingestion of them
*  in plastic water bottles.
*  So it makes sense to me why you would want to avoid those.
*  Also as a consumable, that's not very reusable.
*  I suppose you could reuse those plastic bottles,
*  but most people don't,
*  at least they don't use them for very long.
*  They get pretty flimsy pretty quickly.
*  You're much better off having either a stainless steel bottle
*  or some sort of ceramic mug or using glass
*  or using some other vessel for water that is reusable.
*  And of course, that is not made of plastic.
*  And then of course, the question arises,
*  how much microplastic and nanoplastic is in tap water?
*  And it turns out there's quite a lot of it.
*  Now it varies according to location,
*  but there are ways that you can get those microplastics
*  and nanoplastics out of your tap water.
*  The best way turns out to be a little bit expensive,
*  admittedly, and that's to use a reverse osmosis filter.
*  So reverse osmosis filters will get rid
*  of all the microplastics and nanoplastics.
*  Of course, it will also remove some key minerals
*  from the water.
*  So you'll have to remineralize that water.
*  If one looks at the price
*  of reverse osmosis filtration systems, they're not cheap.
*  They can range anywhere from 300 to 500,
*  or even $600 for a home unit.
*  And many of those units will remineralize the water.
*  So basically it takes the water,
*  cleans out the microplastics, nanoplastics,
*  and a bunch of other bad stuff that you don't want.
*  And then it's going to remineralize the water
*  so that you're getting enough minerals in your water.
*  Now, if you look at the cost of a reverse osmosis filter,
*  I, like you, kind of go a little wide-eyed,
*  like, that's a lot of money for water.
*  But if one thinks about the total amount of money
*  one spends in a given year on plastic bottled water
*  that we consume and then throw away,
*  essentially, the bottles,
*  or even bottled water from glass bottles,
*  I've gotten in the habit of trying to drink water
*  from glass bottles.
*  And when you go out and you buy those,
*  you feel better that you're not consuming
*  a lot of microplastics and nanoplastics,
*  but they are very expensive.
*  So the costs probably line up pretty well.
*  And when I did that analysis, I realized,
*  well, actually the home reverse osmosis filter
*  with remineralization actually will save on costs,
*  provided that one is good about filling glass bottles
*  or stainless steel bottles with that water
*  and making sure that, you know,
*  when you leave the house to take those bottles with you.
*  Again, I don't think it's possible for everyone
*  to avoid all consumption of water from plastic bottles.
*  That's just not reasonable to expect, right?
*  You don't want to be that person that's carrying around
*  water everywhere you go to friends' houses at dinner,
*  et cetera.
*  I don't think we need to be that concerned
*  about the amount of microplastic and nanoplastic
*  in water sources.
*  And certainly you wouldn't want to avoid drinking water
*  from plastic bottles to the point where you dehydrate
*  yourself or put yourself at risk.
*  I'm not trying to create that kind of concern here.
*  What I'm trying to say is,
*  if you are concerned about microplastics and nanoplastics
*  and you really want to limit your exposure,
*  one of the best ways to do that is to limit your consumption
*  of water from plastic bottles.
*  And because microplastics and nanoplastics
*  are present in tap water,
*  you're going to need some way to remove those microplastics
*  and nanoplastics from your tap water
*  if you're very concerned about them.
*  I'm not here to say everyone should do this.
*  I'm certainly not saying that.
*  I'm saying that if you are concerned about microplastics
*  and nanoplastics, and we'll talk about some of the reasons
*  one might want to be concerned about them,
*  well, then installing a reverse osmosis filtration system
*  on your home water might be a good idea.
*  And it's likely to save you costs if you look at it
*  in comparison to buying disposable bottles of water.
*  Now, there are a lot of other ways besides drinking water
*  from plastic bottles that microplastics and nanoplastics
*  make their way into our system.
*  And I can list off many of them,
*  but I'm trying to create a hierarchy here of the things
*  that are potentially the major sources
*  and the ones that we can most easily avoid
*  and that are likely to save us costs overall.
*  So one thing that's very clear is that there's a lot
*  of microplastics and nanoplastics and sea salt.
*  Who would have thought?
*  But then you think about it and it's like,
*  well, this stuff is getting out into the ocean.
*  There's a lot of plastic in the ocean.
*  It's a super depressing scene when one sees the pictures
*  of all the plastic floating out there.
*  In fact, there's a book that I read in preparation
*  for this episode.
*  Gosh, it was so depressing, but important for me to read.
*  Maybe you want to read it as well.
*  It's quite good, although it will be a bit of a downer.
*  The title of the book is,
*  A Poison Like No Other,
*  How Microplastics Corrupted Our Planet and Our Bodies
*  by Matt Simon.
*  And I listened to this book and gosh,
*  it really convinces you that there's microplastics everywhere
*  both on land, in the air and in the ocean, unfortunately.
*  And of course, sea salt comes from the ocean.
*  So a simple solution to this is if you're going to use salt,
*  and I'm a big fan of salt, not overdoing it,
*  but salt has its role, right?
*  It's a wonderful substance, both for sake of taste
*  and for sake of health.
*  I did an episode about salt.
*  Again, don't over consume salt.
*  Don't blast your blood pressure.
*  Don't blow a gasket, but many people would do well
*  to have a little bit more salt,
*  especially if you're eating a really clean diet,
*  especially if you're hydrating very well.
*  Focus on something like pink Himalayan salt
*  or salt that comes from a non-marine source, okay?
*  It's very simple to do.
*  It's some of the best salt out there.
*  It's not terribly expensive.
*  And you would do well to avoid sea salt
*  and get your salt from those other sources.
*  In doing so, you're going to lower your exposure
*  to microplastics and nanoplastics.
*  There's some pretty scary pictures of sea salt
*  under the microscope and all the little bits of plastic
*  that are in there.
*  And you only have to see those pictures once
*  or just hear it from me to make the shift
*  to Himalayan sea salt.
*  And where the pink salt is pretty, it looks nice.
*  It tastes great.
*  So that's an easy, very low cost shift that you can make.
*  I'd like to take a quick break
*  and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
*  AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
*  that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens.
*  AG1 is designed to cover all of your foundational
*  nutritional needs and it tastes great.
*  Now I've been drinking AG1 since 2012.
*  And I started doing that at a time
*  when my budget for supplements was really limited.
*  In fact, I only had enough money back then
*  to purchase one supplement.
*  And I'm so glad that I made that supplement, AG1.
*  The reason for that is even though I strive to eat
*  most of my foods from whole foods
*  and minimally processed foods,
*  it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits,
*  vegetables, vitamins and minerals, micronutrients
*  and adaptogens from food alone.
*  And I need to do that in order to ensure
*  that I have enough energy throughout the day,
*  I sleep well at night and keep my immune system strong.
*  But when I take AG1 daily, I find that all aspects
*  of my health, my physical health, my mental health
*  and my performance, both cognitive and physical are better.
*  I know that because I've had lapses
*  when I didn't take AG1 and I certainly felt the difference.
*  I also noticed, and this makes perfect sense
*  given the relationship between the gut microbiome
*  and the brain, that when I regularly take AG1,
*  which for me means a serving in the morning or mid morning
*  and again, later in the afternoon or evening,
*  that I have more mental clarity and more mental energy.
*  If you'd like to try AG1, you can go to drinkag1.com
*  slash Huberman to claim a special offer.
*  Right now they're giving away five free travel packs
*  and a year's supply of vitamin D3 K2.
*  Again, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman
*  to claim that special offer.
*  Okay, so we've talked about bottled watered sources
*  and filtering your water.
*  We talked about sea salt.
*  Another major source of these microplastics
*  that was very surprising to me
*  is from the lining of canned soup.
*  I don't think I'm ever going to eat canned soup again
*  unless I absolutely need to.
*  Sorry, canned soup companies, but there was a study,
*  the study was entitled, canned soup consumption
*  and urinary bisphenol A, a randomized crossover trial.
*  I'll describe a little bit more about what bisphenol A
*  is a little bit later,
*  but bisphenol A is a known endocrine disruptor.
*  It mimics estrogen in ways that can activate
*  or block estrogenic pathways.
*  So it messes up hormone pathways,
*  either by activating them or blocking them.
*  It can also bind to androgen receptors potentially
*  and cause some issues there.
*  Bisphenol A or BPA is not a good thing.
*  Turns out there's lots of it in the lining of soup cans.
*  The reason is soup tends to be a little bit fatty.
*  So even if you get the non-fat soup,
*  it tends to have some lipid in there
*  and it also has some acidity to it.
*  And the lining helps maintain the flavor
*  and the freshness of the soup in those cans.
*  In this study, what they did is they gave people
*  either fresh soup or canned soup for five days.
*  Then they did a so-called two-day washout
*  where they took a break from soup
*  and then they reversed the conditions.
*  I'll cut to the chase here
*  because the conclusion of this study is wild.
*  What they found was that consumption
*  of one serving of canned soup daily
*  over the course of five days, here I'm quoting by the way,
*  was associated with more than a thousand percent increase
*  in urinary BPA, in bisphenol A.
*  Now that's urinary BPA, so people are excreting it.
*  I want to emphasize that.
*  But a thousand-fold increase in BPA from canned soup,
*  I don't know, I'm not alarmist,
*  but I only have to read this once.
*  Think about my love of canned soup, not that great, done.
*  I'm not eating canned soup again,
*  unless I'm absolutely starving
*  and I need some soup very, very badly.
*  My suggestion would be,
*  unless you have a powerful reason to consume canned soup,
*  don't consume canned soup.
*  The one caveat being that if you can find canned soup
*  that does not have any BPA,
*  that is it says no BPAs on the container,
*  well then go at it.
*  Have as much canned soup as you want.
*  But I should be very clear that a lot of canned products
*  now say no BPA, but they contain other endocrine disruptors
*  and the amount of microplastics and nanoplastics
*  in those soups is still unknown.
*  So part of my hidden motivation of this episode
*  and perhaps the motivation of other podcasters
*  in the health space that are talking about microplastics now,
*  and by the way, Dr. Rhonda Patrick
*  did a really wonderful podcast about microplastics
*  just recently.
*  We didn't coordinate,
*  that's why we both ended up doing it roughly
*  at the same time.
*  We talked about it afterwards and chuckled about that.
*  I guess, you know, we're both interested
*  in some of the same themes, of course.
*  One of the perhaps hidden agendas
*  is that some of these food manufacturing companies
*  and beverage manufacturing companies
*  will start to include more thorough descriptions
*  on their labeling of what is and is not contained
*  in the various products such as canned soup
*  and water, et cetera, not just no BPAs,
*  but hopefully some of the other things
*  that are problematic that we'll talk about in a moment,
*  such as BPS, which is another endocrine disruptor.
*  So if you see no BPAs, sometimes there's still BPS in there.
*  Okay, we'll talk about BPS as well as phthalates,
*  which are something that make plastic
*  and other containers more durable and more flexible.
*  And phthalates have been discussed
*  by people like Dr. Shayna Swan,
*  who will soon be a guest on this podcast
*  and has shown up on other podcasts,
*  talking about how phthalates are known endocrine disruptors
*  in development and likely in adulthood as well.
*  So I guess my push for you to never consume canned soup
*  again might be a little bit harsh.
*  That's just my decision.
*  Here's what I'll do.
*  I'll make a bargain with the canned soup companies.
*  If you all start putting a more thorough description
*  about what is and is not contained in those soup cans,
*  all right, not just no BPA,
*  but is there truly also no BPS?
*  Are there no phthalates, et cetera?
*  Then maybe I'll make the move back to canned soup.
*  And of course, most of you have probably heard
*  that you're not supposed to microwave plastic containers.
*  Now, you'll see microwave safe
*  on a number of different containers.
*  That just means that it's not going to melt in the microwave.
*  It does not mean that you aren't being exposed
*  to microplastics and nanoplastics and BPAs,
*  BPS, phthalates, et cetera.
*  So in general, it's a good idea
*  to avoid putting any kind of plastic into the microwave,
*  at least if you're going to microwave food
*  and then consume that food.
*  The other surprising, at least to me,
*  source of BPAs and BPSs,
*  so these endocrine disruptors and microplastics
*  and nanoplastics, that's very robust, is paper cups.
*  Goodness gracious, I would have thought paper cups are safe,
*  but you know those paper cups
*  that you put hot liquids into
*  and they often have a plastic lid?
*  Well, even if they don't have a plastic lid on them,
*  the lining of the paper cup,
*  which makes those cups durable
*  when you put hot liquids in there,
*  like hot coffee or hot tea,
*  well, that contains typically,
*  unless it says no BPA and no BPS,
*  it contains lots of BPA and BPSs,
*  microplastics, nanoplastics.
*  And so putting hot liquids in there,
*  actually there was an analysis that showed
*  that if liquid that's heated up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit
*  is put in those containers, it starts to leach out,
*  it starts to pull those microplastics, nanoplastics,
*  BPAs and BPS from the cup linings.
*  So the other day I went across the street
*  and bought a cup of coffee,
*  of course they sold it to me in a paper cup
*  and I thought, oh goodness, I forgot to bring my mug
*  and my travel mug, my stainless steel mug or my ceramic mug.
*  Did I not purchase the coffee?
*  No, I'd already ordered the coffee.
*  I didn't walk back.
*  What I did is as soon as I got back,
*  I took the coffee and I poured it into a ceramic mug.
*  So I'm not extremist.
*  I'm not somebody who's going to completely
*  avoid these things, but in the future,
*  I'll try and remember to bring my mug over.
*  Some places even give you a little discount on your coffee.
*  So again, these are cost saving approaches.
*  You're certainly limiting or reducing the amount of waste
*  that you're creating in the world.
*  So that can only be a good thing, okay?
*  And the plastic lids,
*  probably a good idea to avoid drinking
*  through those plastic lids too often.
*  Again, I want to emphasize,
*  I'm not one of these people that's going to freak out
*  about drinking a hot liquid through a plastic lid.
*  These microplastics and nanoplastics are everywhere.
*  We're consuming them all the time.
*  We can remove them from our body.
*  And later we'll talk about ways that you can accelerate
*  or increase the amount of removal of them from your body.
*  But if we're just a little bit more conscious
*  about how they get into our body
*  and we're a little bit more conscious
*  about the elevated costs and the elevated amount of trash,
*  that's going to recycle into landfill and so on,
*  probably a good idea to just bring your mug with you,
*  your travel mug with you,
*  try and make those mugs and travel mugs,
*  ceramic, stainless steel, or some other vessel
*  that doesn't contain BPAs or BPSs.
*  Before we move on to talk about what happens
*  when microplastics and nanoplastics make it into say,
*  the testicle or the brain,
*  like what the consequences of that is and are,
*  I want to just briefly return to something
*  that I flew past a while ago.
*  And that's the analysis of microplastics
*  and nanoplastic particles that are in bottled water.
*  Remember, initially it was thought
*  to be 30,000 particles per liter,
*  then later it was discovered using better techniques
*  that it's actually more like 240,000
*  on average particles per liter.
*  How did that huge discrepancy in data arise?
*  Now, I realize this is not a data analysis discussion,
*  but I want to talk about this just briefly
*  because it illustrates for you something really important
*  about science, which is as tools for measurement get better,
*  so does our understanding about what's going on
*  in our brains and bodies.
*  And it's a very simple and kind of cool thing
*  related to light.
*  So you could imagine that the first paper
*  was looking under the microscope at a drop of water
*  taken from a bottle that was plastic
*  and then imaged the number
*  of little plastic particles in there.
*  You'd say, well, there's a particle,
*  and there's a particle, and there's a particle.
*  And there are tools that can count those particles.
*  Well, what if you have two particles
*  that are really close together, right?
*  If you recall, microplastics are anywhere
*  from one micron in diameter
*  all the way up to five millimeters in diameter,
*  but nanoplastics are less than one micron in diameter.
*  So how do you know that when you see a clump of stuff
*  under the microscope in that drop of water,
*  that you're looking at one big piece of plastic
*  versus thousands and thousands of little pieces
*  of nanoplastic or even just much smaller pieces
*  of microplastic?
*  Well, it has to do with what's called
*  the point spread function,
*  and I don't really want to get into this in too much detail,
*  but basically when you shine light on something,
*  you get kind of a little hill of light, if you will.
*  There's a peak at the center,
*  and then it drops off with distance.
*  The reason why the numbers jumped from 30,000 to 240,000
*  is not because the researchers got much better,
*  it's because the tools got much better, okay?
*  There are new imaging techniques,
*  and I'll put a reference to this for those of you
*  that are into this kind of stuff,
*  entitled Rapid Single Particle Chemical Imaging
*  of Nanoplastics by SRS Microscopy, okay?
*  Pretty nerdy stuff,
*  but it's fun if you're interested in light
*  and how light can illuminate things
*  and show detail or not detail,
*  but basically what we're realizing
*  is that there are a lot more particles of plastic
*  in different tissues, in different things
*  that we're ingesting, et cetera,
*  because we're getting better and better ways
*  of separating those clumps of light
*  into lots of little clumps of light
*  and realizing, oh, that looked like one particle, right?
*  Remember, it's particles per liter.
*  It's not one particle, it's 10,000 particles.
*  Now you might say, okay, well, what's the difference
*  between a bunch of little particles and one big particle?
*  Ah, there's a big difference.
*  What's the big difference?
*  Little particles can make it across barriers
*  that big particles can't.
*  These little nanoparticles of plastic
*  are especially concerning because those are the ones
*  that you find in greatest abundance,
*  or I should say among the plastics
*  that you find in different tissues,
*  the ones that are in greatest abundance in the brain,
*  the testes and the follicle, again,
*  these tissues that nature and evolution
*  have gone out of their way to protect
*  with these very stringent barriers,
*  like the blood-brain barrier,
*  like the blood-testicular barrier,
*  like the blood-follicle barrier.
*  Those are the ones that are getting across
*  because they're very, very small.
*  They can sneak through the little holes
*  in those biological fences.
*  They're getting deposited in those tissues,
*  brain, testicle, and follicle,
*  and they're staying there at least until people die,
*  which in the case of the analysis of post-mortem tissue
*  is many, many decades later.
*  So I'm not just raising this discussion
*  about ways to disambiguate large particles
*  from small particles just to be nerdy and technical.
*  It turns out to be a really important issue
*  with real biological implications.
*  So lots of itty bitty little pieces of plastic
*  getting their way into tissues like brain, follicle,
*  testes, liver, lung, et cetera.
*  What are some of the implications of this?
*  Now, there are a lot of animal data,
*  data in fish, data in mice, et cetera,
*  that have explored how microplastics and nanoplastics
*  can disrupt any number of different biological functions.
*  But it's probably worth looking at how nanoplastic
*  and microplastic accumulation in specific tissues
*  is correlated with specific health detriments in humans,
*  even though the data are correlative, right?
*  It's much harder to get causal data from human studies
*  because the animal studies, frankly,
*  are hard to translate to humans.
*  In this case in particular,
*  because a lot of the features of animal biology,
*  while similar to human biology,
*  humans are animals, but you get the point,
*  they don't correspond so easily
*  when looking at microplastics and nanoplastics
*  for the following reason.
*  Let's say you have a little fish,
*  that fish is a couple centimeters long,
*  and it turns out there's, I don't know,
*  about an aspirin's size of microplastics and nanoplastics
*  in that fish when that fish is analyzed postmortem.
*  You say, okay, well, that's kind of a lot, right?
*  An aspirin's worth in a, or an aspirin size batch
*  of microplastics and nanoplastics in that little fish.
*  And then you look in humans and you realize,
*  okay, well, there's more microplastics and nanoplastics,
*  but not that much more.
*  How much of a detriment is there really going to be?
*  Can you look at the study in the fish,
*  seeing, for instance, and this has been demonstrated,
*  that you have disruption in neurological pathways,
*  the formation of those pathways,
*  like brain development is altered,
*  reproductive function is altered, et cetera.
*  It's hard to translate.
*  We don't really know what it means in terms of humans.
*  So we'll turn to the correlative data in humans,
*  and I'll look to the strongest data,
*  at least that I could find out there.
*  And there are kind of three major cases
*  that I think are worth highlighting.
*  The first one is that there was a study done in humans,
*  this was published in 2021.
*  It was published in the Journal of Environmental Science
*  and Technology that found much higher levels
*  of microplastics in the stool samples of people
*  that were diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome.
*  Okay, irritable bowel syndrome is very disruptive
*  to people's wellbeing.
*  There isn't an obvious cure for irritable bowel syndrome,
*  although some people find relief
*  by improving their gut microbiota,
*  by limiting body-wide and gut inflammation
*  through any number of different things,
*  improving sleep and eating a low inflammation diet, et cetera.
*  This is something that I'll probably cover
*  in a future episode of the Huberman Lab podcast,
*  gastrointestinal challenges, that is.
*  So I want to be very clear,
*  there was no direct causation established,
*  but it was clear that there were higher levels
*  of microplastics found in the stool tissue
*  coming from people who had irritable bowel syndrome
*  than in individuals who did not have
*  irritable bowel syndrome.
*  And while no study is perfect,
*  they included a number of important controls
*  in the experiment to control for age range
*  and some other features.
*  So it's reasonable to assume that the accumulation
*  of microplastics in the gut
*  or somewhere along the GI tract had somehow led to
*  or related to irritable bowel syndrome.
*  Okay, now you could also imagine the reverse.
*  This is very important to understand.
*  You could also imagine that people
*  who had irritable bowel syndrome
*  perhaps are less good at filtering microplastics
*  and nanoplastics from the food and liquids they consume
*  than are people who don't have irritable bowel syndrome.
*  So the causality, if it exists at all,
*  could run in either direction or both.
*  Nonetheless, I think it's an interesting study.
*  And if you're somebody who suffers
*  from gastrointestinal distress,
*  such as irritable bowel syndrome or otherwise,
*  I think you'd be wise.
*  Indeed, all people would be wise,
*  but I think you'd be especially wise
*  to take into consideration some of the to-dos
*  and not to-dos that I'm covering during today's episode,
*  such as avoiding consuming water from plastic bottles,
*  some of the stuff we talked about earlier,
*  avoiding canned soup and other BPA, BPS containing containers
*  and things of that sort,
*  or things that come from those containers.
*  The other area where there was some really interesting
*  correlative data relates to reproductive function
*  and hormone health.
*  And this is where we can start to get into a bit more detail
*  about BPAs and BPSs and phthalates
*  and some of their roles in disrupting endocrine,
*  that is hormone pathways.
*  So there's a study I'll put a link to
*  in the show note captions that's entitled,
*  urinary phthalate metabolites are associated
*  with decreased serum testosterone,
*  so that's in blood, in men, women and children.
*  Okay.
*  This is an interesting study for a number of reasons.
*  First of all, it emphasizes something
*  that everybody should know,
*  which is that testosterone plays key roles
*  in men, women and kids.
*  Okay.
*  It is not the case that testosterone is just present
*  in men and boys, it's also present in women and girls.
*  And it plays an important role in everybody.
*  Okay. It's involved of course,
*  in some of the things that we normally associate
*  with testosterone, such as muscle mass,
*  bone density, strength, et cetera,
*  but testosterone can be converted to estrogen.
*  Testosterone is involved in libido in both men and women,
*  it's involved in brain development in boys and girls,
*  in genitalia development and on and on.
*  So it's an important hormone.
*  And it was clear from this study
*  that elevated levels of phthalates,
*  that is phthalate metabolites are associated
*  with lower testosterone levels in all those populations.
*  They point out quote,
*  that the strongest and most consistent inverse relationships
*  between level phthalates and testosterone,
*  that is elevated phthalate metabolites, lower testosterone,
*  were found among women ages 40 to 60 years.
*  And this is very important if you saw the episode
*  that we did with Dr. Mary Claire Haver
*  on perimenopause menopause,
*  she emphasized that perimenopause menopause,
*  which typically sets in somewhere
*  between one's late 40s and 60s.
*  Okay. There's huge variation there.
*  Sometimes as early as one's 30s,
*  that would be early, however,
*  more often in one's 40s and 50s,
*  sometimes as late as 60s,
*  involves reductions in estrogen, but also in testosterone.
*  And this has major implications
*  for creating less feelings of vigor, lowered libido,
*  less recovery from exercise and other life stressors
*  and things of that sort.
*  Now the study also interestingly shows that in quote,
*  adult men, the only significant
*  or suggestive inverse association
*  between phthalate metabolites and testosterone
*  were observed among men 40 to 60 years old.
*  Now there are a number of different ways
*  that we can interpret those data.
*  One is that men younger than 40
*  have high enough levels of testosterone
*  that or the ranges of testosterone are great enough
*  in that sample of younger than 40 years old,
*  that somehow that was able to swamp out any reductions
*  in testosterone that were caused by phthalate metabolites,
*  or rather that once men get from 40 to 60 years old,
*  that there's somehow a vulnerability
*  of the testosterone pathways to phthalates,
*  or, and none of these are mutually exclusive of course,
*  that the phthalates had built up in those men system
*  over a number of years,
*  and then we're having their major effects on those men
*  between 40 and 60 years old.
*  I do find it interesting that the major effects
*  were observed in both men and women 40 to 60 years old.
*  And the interpretation of those data
*  that makes the most sense to me at least,
*  is that there's a cumulative effect
*  of these phthalates over time that reveals itself,
*  at least statistically in men and women
*  once they reach 40 to 60 years.
*  So what are these phthalates?
*  Well, these phthalates are things that are included
*  in plastics that house liquids and foods that we eat,
*  or that we cook with,
*  or that simply exist in our environment
*  and are getting broken down and that we're inhaling,
*  and then are making their way
*  across the blood testes barrier,
*  blood follicle barrier, or into any number of other tissues.
*  Those phthalates are there of course,
*  to make plastic more flexible and durable,
*  but they are known endocrine disruptors.
*  Dr. Shana Swan has done beautiful work
*  showing that young animals and potentially humans
*  who are exposed to phthalates
*  from things like pesticides in particular,
*  can actually have a fairly major disruption
*  in what's called the anogenital distance, okay?
*  Withhold your chuckles.
*  The distance between the penis and the anus
*  in people that have been exposed to phthalates
*  or mothers of boys that have been exposed to phthalates,
*  those boys are born with a shorter penile to anal distance.
*  Typically it's of a certain distance
*  and there's a correlation with reduced anogenital distance
*  that is a external marker, okay?
*  It's not that that itself is necessarily a bad thing.
*  That's not what we're saying here,
*  but that's an external marker that can be measured in mice.
*  And there are some studies
*  that are exploring that in humans as well,
*  that correlates with a number of other things,
*  including lower sperm counts,
*  reduced sperm motility and things of that sort.
*  Likewise, BPAs, the bisphenol A and BPS
*  are known endocrine disruptors.
*  I talked about this a little bit earlier.
*  They're known to bind to estrogen receptors,
*  so they mimic estrogen.
*  Sometimes they activate
*  those estrogen receptor dependent pathways,
*  so they literally mimic estrogen.
*  Sometimes they block those estrogen receptors
*  so that estrogen cannot have the normal role
*  of docking in those receptors
*  and causing their normal functions.
*  And BPA and to some extent BPS
*  and potentially phthalates
*  can dock to androgen receptors as well,
*  sometimes referred to as testosterone receptors,
*  androgen receptors.
*  So the point is that BPAs, BPSs and phthalates
*  are not good for endocrine function,
*  and they are present in basically all plastics
*  unless it says no BPA or all phthalates removed,
*  they're present in herbicides, et cetera.
*  And they're of real concern.
*  And it's very clear, as I mentioned earlier,
*  that you can detect microplastics in human testes,
*  and I didn't mention this earlier, end in semen,
*  and it is now very clear that that's correlated
*  with reduced sperm counts and lower sperm motility.
*  Now, I also want to be very clear,
*  remember, I'm not an alarmist.
*  I want to be clear that just because sperm counts
*  are significantly lower in people that have a certain amount
*  of microplastics and nanoplastics potentially
*  in their testes or that they've been exposed to
*  does not necessarily mean that they're infertile.
*  It is true that total sperm count and sperm motility,
*  forward motility being an important indicator
*  of sperm health, are correlated with one's ability
*  to fertilize an egg, okay?
*  This was covered in a quite long,
*  but quite detailed episode that I did about fertility
*  in both males and females.
*  There are a number of things one can do
*  to increase sperm counts
*  or to at least limit sperm count depletion.
*  There are a number of things that one can do
*  to improve sperm motility.
*  I encourage you to check out that episode.
*  I'll provide a link to it in the show note captions.
*  In fact, I'll link to the specific timestamp
*  in the show note captions
*  that gets to those particular strategies.
*  But the point here is that microplastics and nanoplastics
*  are found in human testes,
*  and that's correlated with reductions in sperm count
*  and reductions in sperm motility.
*  I'd like to take a quick break
*  and thank one of our sponsors, Function.
*  I recently became a Function member
*  after searching for the most comprehensive approach
*  to lab testing.
*  While I've long been a fan of blood testing,
*  I really wanted to find a more in-depth program
*  for analyzing blood, urine, and saliva
*  to get a full picture of my heart health,
*  my hormone status, my immune system regulation,
*  my metabolic function, my vitamin and mineral status,
*  and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality.
*  Function not only provides testing
*  of over a hundred biomarkers key to physical
*  and mental health, but it also analyzes these results
*  and provides insights from top doctors on your results.
*  For example, in one of my first tests with Function,
*  I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood.
*  This was totally surprising to me.
*  I had no idea prior to taking the test.
*  Function not only helped me detect this,
*  but offered medical doctor-informed insights
*  on how to best reduce those mercury levels,
*  which included limiting my tuna consumption
*  because I had been eating a lot of tuna
*  while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens
*  and supplementing with NAC, N-acetylcysteine,
*  both of which can support glutathione production
*  and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels.
*  Comprehensive lab testing like this
*  is so important for health.
*  And while I've been doing it for years,
*  I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive.
*  I've been so impressed by Function,
*  both at the level of ease of use,
*  that is getting the tests done,
*  as well as how comprehensive and how actionable the tests are,
*  that I recently joined their advisory board,
*  and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast.
*  If you'd like to try Function,
*  go to functionhealth.com slash Huberman.
*  Function currently has a wait list of over 250,000 people,
*  but they're offering early access to Huberman Lab listeners.
*  Again, that's functionhealth.com slash Huberman
*  to get early access to Function.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep.
*  8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating,
*  and sleep tracking capacity.
*  Now, I've spoken many times before on this podcast
*  about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts
*  of quality sleep each night.
*  That's truly the foundation of all mental health,
*  physical health, and performance.
*  And one of the best ways to ensure
*  that you get a great night's sleep
*  is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
*  And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
*  your body temperature actually has to drop
*  by about one to three degrees.
*  And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
*  your body temperature actually has to increase
*  about one to three degrees.
*  8 Sleep makes it incredibly easy to control the temperature
*  of your sleeping environment
*  by allowing you to control the temperature
*  of your mattress cover at the beginning, middle,
*  and end of the night.
*  I've been sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover
*  for nearly four years now,
*  and it has completely transformed
*  and improved the quality of my sleep.
*  8 Sleep has now launched their newest generation
*  of the pod cover, the Pod4 Ultra.
*  The Pod4 Ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity,
*  higher fidelity sleep tracking technology,
*  and even has snoring detection
*  that will automatically lift your head a few degrees
*  to improve your airflow and stop your snoring.
*  If you'd like to try an 8 Sleep mattress cover,
*  go to 8sleep.com slash Huberman
*  to save up to $350 off their Pod4 Ultra.
*  8 Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
*  select countries in the EU, and Australia.
*  Again, that's 8sleep.com slash Huberman.
*  Another study that got people's attention
*  that I think is worth mentioning,
*  which relates to microplastics, nanoplastics,
*  and cardiovascular disease.
*  This was a study published
*  in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2024,
*  so this is a fabulously good journal.
*  And what it found was that polyethylene,
*  which is a component of many plastics out there,
*  were detected in the carotid artery plaques of,
*  in this case, 150 patients,
*  which is approximately 58% of the ones
*  that were included in this study.
*  And they also found using a technique
*  called electron microscopy.
*  Today's fun,
*  because we get to talk about different types of microscopy.
*  Electron microscopy allows you to look at things
*  that are smaller than a micron.
*  You can look all the way down into the nanometer range,
*  right, you can start breaking up
*  that 1 1,000th of a millimeter into nanometers,
*  and you can start to see things that are really, really small.
*  And in this study, electron microscopy showed
*  that there were these jagged edge foreign particles
*  among the plaque macrophages
*  of these cardiovascular plaques, okay?
*  Macrophages are part of the immune system.
*  These are cells that go in and try and eat things up.
*  They're kind of like little ambulances.
*  Later, we're going to talk about microglia,
*  which are the brain's resident microphages,
*  or microfages, depending on where you live
*  and how you like to pronounce it.
*  But the point here is that when using a technique
*  like electron microscopy
*  that allows you to look at really, really small stuff,
*  it was very clear that the plaques that form these,
*  now basically occlusions within the arteries,
*  these are not good.
*  This is one of the reasons you want to eat properly
*  and do cardiovascular exercise
*  and take great care of yourself, et cetera.
*  Electron microscopy made very clear
*  that there were little plastic foreign jagged particles
*  deposited in some of these plaques.
*  Now, were they the cause of these plaques?
*  Did they contribute to some of the occlusion
*  caused by those plaques?
*  Unclear.
*  But it's reasonable to assume
*  that they form part of the physical substrate
*  that could occlude blood flow through these arteries,
*  which of course leads to cardiovascular events,
*  which of course are not good.
*  So I'll put a link to this study in the show note captions.
*  Again, these are correlative studies in humans.
*  Correlative studies are only that, they're just correlative,
*  but I'm trying to provide a patchwork of things
*  that suggests that it would indeed be a good idea
*  to try and limit your ingestion
*  or at least facilitate the removal of microplastics
*  and nanoplastics from your system.
*  Another reason to do that
*  relates to the so-called PFASs, okay?
*  These are a group of chemicals
*  sometimes referred to as the quote unquote forever chemicals
*  because they are very long standing
*  once they get into your system.
*  These things have names other than PFAS,
*  which is an acronym, things like perfluoralkalo,
*  things like polyfluoralkalo.
*  I don't know how good my pronunciation of those is,
*  but if you look up the PFASs,
*  you'll see that these things are known to cause liver damage.
*  They can damage the immune system.
*  They are considered forever chemicals
*  because they are not broken down.
*  They last forever.
*  Then again, some of the other components of microplastics
*  and nanoplastics are also known to last forever.
*  So you're starting to get a picture
*  of these little tiny bits of plastic,
*  some tinier than others,
*  depositing themselves in our tissues.
*  They're everywhere out there.
*  They are most prominent in certain sources,
*  but they're going to get into our system.
*  Now, does that mean that we can't get rid of them?
*  No, we absolutely can get rid of them.
*  In fact, we have a number of different ways
*  that we get rid of toxins and foreign invaders in our body.
*  Some of those include the immune system, right?
*  Even if you have just some sort of foreign object
*  like a splinter, your immune system has a reaction to that.
*  Typically you get some pus around it, some inflammation,
*  and that pus and inflammation is part of the process
*  of isolating that foreign intruder, that splinter,
*  and then eventually creating some tissues
*  that extrude it or allow you to extrude it.
*  You of course also have
*  what's called your adaptive immune system,
*  which doesn't just react to the presence of something foreign,
*  but it creates antibodies which can combat that
*  and so on and so forth.
*  So your body has these frankly miraculous ways
*  of dealing with foreign intruders of different sorts,
*  but it does seem that microplastics and nanoplastics
*  can deposit themselves in their tissues and stay there.
*  Does that mean that you don't have any chance
*  of getting them out?
*  No, you have a liver.
*  Your liver, yes, contains microplastics and nanoplastics,
*  very likely if you've been alive for any amount of time,
*  but it also has what's called phase one
*  and phase two detoxification processes
*  that allow you to break down
*  and get rid of certain foreign products,
*  including microplastics and nanoplastics.
*  So let's talk about liver detoxification
*  and some of the things that can facilitate
*  liver detoxification that you actually have control over.
*  Okay, so let's talk about liver detoxification.
*  The liver is such a cool organ.
*  It does so many cool things.
*  It's not just about detoxification, by the way.
*  It does all sorts of things related to blood clotting.
*  It's just an amazing, amazing organ.
*  We should probably do an entire episode about the liver
*  and not just eating liver.
*  I'm not a fan of eating liver.
*  I do it every once in a while
*  because I'm told it's nutritious.
*  But let's talk about the living functioning liver.
*  There are two types of liver detoxification processes.
*  Okay, so this is not about detoxing your liver.
*  Okay, you may hear about detoxing your liver.
*  That's a whole other discussion
*  that I don't want to get into, at least not here.
*  There's type one and type two liver detoxification.
*  There's type one, so-called phase one liver detoxification
*  is also called the oxidation phase.
*  It involves something called cytochrome P450 enzymes.
*  Okay, so enzymes are involved in the breakdown
*  of different things.
*  It converts toxins into less harmful components
*  that ideally are excreted from the body.
*  Okay, type two or phase two liver detoxification.
*  Again, this is not detoxification of your liver.
*  This is detoxification by your liver
*  is also called the conjugation phase of detoxification.
*  It involves enzymes that attach molecules to toxins.
*  Okay, it makes those toxins water soluble
*  and easier to excrete from the body in the form of urine.
*  Okay, it neutralizes reactive intermediates from phase one.
*  Okay, so phase one and phase two detoxification
*  work together during phase two
*  of liver control detoxification is where toxins
*  are broken down and those broken down components
*  are prepared to be removed from the body.
*  Okay, it is thought that the liver plays a primary role
*  in the removal of microplastics and nanoplastics,
*  BPAs and BPSs.
*  And by the way, I realized I didn't say this earlier
*  and I should have.
*  These BPAs and BPSs are sometimes chemical components
*  within the microplastics and nanoplastics.
*  They sometimes attach themselves
*  to the microplastics and nanoplastics.
*  I should have said that earlier, forgive me.
*  The microplastics and nanoplastics can act
*  as what are called vectors or carriers of things like BPAs,
*  BPSs, phthalates and forever chemicals.
*  Okay, I should have mentioned that earlier.
*  So type two, that is phase two
*  of liver control detoxification is where these toxins
*  that are in the body and potentially these microplastics
*  themselves and nanoplastics themselves
*  are not necessarily broken down
*  because some of those things can't be broken down
*  but where they are prepared to be excreted from the body.
*  And we have some degree of control
*  over phase two of liver controlled detoxification.
*  Again, I'm calling it liver controlled detoxification
*  so that this doesn't get misconstrued
*  as detoxing your liver,
*  which frankly is a very controversial topic
*  and may not be possible at all.
*  Although simply by saying that
*  I'm probably going to get attacked.
*  But here we're just talking about your liver's ability
*  to break down and remove things from your body
*  that you frankly don't want in your body.
*  One way that you can enhance phase two
*  liver controlled detoxification processes
*  is by increasing your intake
*  of something called sulforaphane,
*  which is present in cruciferous vegetables
*  such as broccoli and cauliflower.
*  Now, is there enough sulforaphane in cruciferous vegetables
*  such that you could eat reasonable amounts
*  that you wouldn't have to overeat cruciferous vegetables
*  in order to get this enhancement
*  of phase two liver detoxification processes?
*  Potentially yes.
*  The animal studies that were carried out,
*  so this would be in rodents like rats
*  used supplemented sulforaphane at dosages
*  that were comparable to the amounts of sulforaphane
*  that a human might ingest from a large serving of broccoli
*  or a large serving of cauliflower.
*  So this could be a few cups of raw broccoli
*  or raw cauliflower.
*  Although frankly, if you're like me,
*  that basically translates to gastrointestinal distress.
*  I can't tell you how many times I've gone to a party
*  and there's some like broccoli and cauliflower
*  maybe with some dip or something like that.
*  I usually avoid the dip because I'm not really into dips,
*  but we'll have a few pieces of broccoli
*  and boy, does that disrupt my gut.
*  I don't know about you.
*  And most things don't disrupt my gut.
*  That's not something that I struggle with.
*  I prefer to cook broccoli and to cook cauliflower.
*  If you cook broccoli and cauliflower lightly, okay?
*  So you don't just turn into a complete mash.
*  You don't boil it such that a lot of the nutrients
*  are leached out into the water around it.
*  So if you do sort of a light boil or a steam
*  or something like that, or you pan cook it,
*  maybe in some olive oil,
*  this is making me hungry by the way.
*  You'll still maintain the sulforaphane
*  in those cruciferous vegetables,
*  meaning it'll still be beneficial to you.
*  Now, some people, including me,
*  don't tend to eat that many cruciferous vegetables.
*  I don't know why.
*  I just somehow don't make it a point
*  to shop for them enough.
*  I ought to.
*  For people like me, or perhaps you're in the same boat,
*  you can supplement with sulforaphane.
*  And what you'll find is that it's sold by various companies
*  and it's available at a quite wide range of dosages.
*  You'll see, for instance, two products similarly priced.
*  One product will contain 50 milligrams of sulforaphane.
*  The other product will contain 225 milligrams
*  of sulforaphane.
*  Now, if you go to what I consider a really excellent website
*  for thinking about and evaluating this kind of stuff,
*  which is examine.com.
*  I've talked a lot about this site on the podcast before.
*  On examine.com, they talk about the translation
*  of the rodent studies to humans.
*  And here's what they say.
*  They say supplementation of 0.1 to 0.5 milligrams
*  per kilogram of sulforaphane in rats
*  has been noted to be bioactive, okay?
*  Just bioactive.
*  They're not getting specifically at removal
*  of microplastics or nanoplastics.
*  And they translate that to a human dose of,
*  okay, if you're 150 pound person,
*  then that's going to be anywhere from 1.1 to 5.5 milligrams
*  for that 150 pound person.
*  If you're a 200 pound person, that's approximately my weight.
*  I think right now I'm sitting somewhere around 215.
*  So about a hundred kilograms, 215,
*  I don't know, somewhere in there.
*  I haven't stood on a scale in a while.
*  It's 1.5 to 7.2 milligrams for a 200 pound person.
*  Now, then you think about the typical dosages
*  that are found in supplements of 50 milligrams per serving
*  versus 225 milligrams per serving.
*  And in either case, you realize that that's much, much higher
*  than what's being discussed here.
*  So what that says to me is that I would probably go
*  with the lower dosage.
*  Although according to examine.com, they say, quote,
*  these low quantities are likely attainable
*  through raw broccoli or cruciferous vegetable products.
*  So that's great.
*  What this means is that you don't need to supplement
*  with sulforaphane if you're willing to eat raw broccoli.
*  They're specifically saying raw broccoli
*  or other cruciferous vegetable products,
*  while higher dosages may be further beneficial.
*  So this is still a bit of a vague space.
*  I realize there's some discrepancies
*  in what I'm describing here.
*  I said you could lightly cook the broccoli or cauliflower.
*  That's my read and understanding of sulforaphane,
*  that it's not broken down at low temperatures.
*  But perhaps you just decide to eat it raw
*  if you can bear it.
*  I can't, so I don't.
*  You could supplement it if you choose.
*  What dosage?
*  Well, that depends on your weight.
*  And it seems that in any case,
*  most supplements are going to more than cover
*  the amount of sulforaphane that's described here,
*  translated from the RAT studies.
*  So in my case, after researching this episode,
*  I opted to start taking 50 milligrams,
*  five zero milligrams of sulforaphane per day.
*  I'm going to see how that goes.
*  I guess it's fair to say that I'm sufficiently concerned
*  about microplastics and nanoplastics,
*  given that I'm 49 years old.
*  All my biomarkers seem fine,
*  but hey, I'm always interested in doing something
*  for my health or to promote my health, that is, if I can.
*  And it's pretty clear to me that if one's thinking
*  about liver control detoxification,
*  both for sake of offsetting or removing BPAs, BPSs,
*  but also other potentially toxic metabolites
*  from microplastics, nanoplastics,
*  and other environmental factors,
*  that taking 50 milligrams of sulforaphane per day
*  perhaps can be beneficial.
*  So I don't think it's necessary for everybody.
*  In fact, I think everybody should probably be getting
*  some cruciferous vegetables in their diet anyway,
*  at least once a week or a couple of times a week.
*  So if you're not interested in supplementing,
*  that would be the route to go.
*  If you are interested in supplementing,
*  I'll provide a link to this particular location
*  in the examine.com page,
*  so that you can translate some of these dosages
*  to your potential sources
*  of supplemental forms of sulforaphane.
*  The other way that microplastics and nanoplastics
*  can be excreted from the body is in the bowel.
*  And one way to potentially increase the amount
*  of microplastics and nanoplastics, BPAs, BPSs, phthalates,
*  and forever chemicals, those PFASs from your body,
*  is to make sure that you're getting enough dietary fiber.
*  Now, most people can do that simply by eating
*  a fair amount of fruits and vegetables,
*  which I always make a point to do.
*  I also ingest starches, okay?
*  So I'm not pure carnivore.
*  Things like rice, like oatmeal.
*  I like fresh pastas,
*  although it's mainly rice and oatmeal for me these days
*  in terms of starches.
*  Plenty of fruits and vegetables.
*  That's something that I just really make it a point to do.
*  Why is fiber good at doing this?
*  Well, it can bind lipophilic molecules, okay?
*  It can bind molecules that are able
*  to cross cell membranes.
*  And earlier we were talking about the fact that BPA
*  and BPSs mimic estrogen and combined estrogen receptors
*  and potentially to androgen receptors as well.
*  Keep in mind that one of the reasons why those so-called
*  steroid hormone pathways,
*  I know people hear the word steroid
*  and they think performance enhancing steroids, but no.
*  Turns out that testosterone and estrogen
*  are both steroid hormones.
*  One of the reasons those are interesting
*  is that because of their structure,
*  they're able to bind cell surface receptors
*  and have effects on those cells.
*  They are also able to pass through, okay, the hormones.
*  Okay, here I'm not talking about BPAs and BPSs,
*  but the hormones testosterone and estrogen
*  can actually get to the nucleus of cells
*  and can control gene expression.
*  These steroid hormones, testosterone and estrogen
*  work in a very coordinated fashion
*  to create what we call secondary sex characteristics,
*  which are the characteristics of the external body
*  and brain changes and internal changes all over the place,
*  ovaries, testes, et cetera,
*  that are what underlie what we call puberty.
*  And that's because these molecules
*  can actually control gene expression.
*  So when we talk about these molecules like BPAs and BPSs
*  impacting these pathways like estrogen and androgen pathways,
*  this is serious stuff because what you're doing
*  is you're potentially activating or blocking pathways
*  that are involved not just in the function
*  of those cells, but actually the genes
*  that those particular cells express.
*  And this is particularly concerning
*  for any kind of hormone dependent cancers, right?
*  It's perhaps not surprising to you based on what you now know
*  about how hormones work with gene expression, et cetera,
*  that many tissues that turnover cells a lot,
*  such as the testes, right?
*  Producing sperm pretty much throughout the lifespan.
*  The follicle and eggs, right?
*  Breast tissue, right?
*  These are common sites of cancer, okay?
*  There are other cancers that can form, of course,
*  in other tissues like the pancreas and brain, et cetera,
*  but tissues that turnover quite a bit
*  because of the involvement of the cell cycle
*  and because cancer is among other things,
*  the dysregulation of the cell cycle
*  and an overproduction of cells that we call tumors.
*  Those are pathways that are particularly vulnerable
*  to endocrine or hormone disruption.
*  And this is why there's additional concern
*  about microplastics and nanoplastics,
*  perhaps increasing cancer rates,
*  in particular in tissues like the ovary,
*  in particular the testes, in particular any tissue
*  where there's a lot of cellular turnover.
*  So the point here is that eating broccoli,
*  eating cauliflower,
*  potentially supplementing with sulforaphane,
*  here I'm summarizing a bit what I talked about earlier,
*  avoiding drinking water from plastic bottles,
*  maybe getting a reverse osmosis filter,
*  avoiding those diabolical canned soups.
*  I had no idea about these canned soups.
*  Or ensuring that the canned soups that you're eating
*  are safe in ways that we discussed earlier,
*  avoiding sea salts, avoiding,
*  I'm throwing a few other things in here
*  that I haven't mentioned yet,
*  avoiding non-stick pans,
*  trying to cook mainly with cast iron or ceramic
*  and making sure that those are BPA, BPS and PFAS free.
*  Just look at the packaging,
*  do a little bit of homework there and get this one.
*  This is a really surprising one,
*  or at least what's surprising to me, carbonated water,
*  okay, mineral waters.
*  A few years ago, there was an analysis
*  of different popular forms of carbonated water,
*  which is sold in glass containers, okay?
*  It turned out that Topo Chico,
*  which I happened, past tense, happened to love,
*  Topo Chico had 9.76 particles per trillion
*  of these PFASs, these forever chemicals, okay?
*  That was an analysis done in 2020.
*  Perrier 1.1, San Pellegrino 0.31.
*  So we're comparing 9.76 versus 1.1 versus 0.31,
*  which tells me I'm avoiding Topo Chico.
*  I might even avoid Perrier.
*  I'll probably drink San Pellegrino.
*  I'll probably buy a Perrier
*  and drink a Perrier every once in a while.
*  I'm not crazy about carbonated water.
*  By the way, this was an analysis by Consumer Reports,
*  and it caught some attention such that the Coca-Cola company,
*  which makes Topo Chico,
*  said that they were going to fix this problem,
*  and they claimed, okay, I don't know if they've done this,
*  all right, I don't want to get the folks
*  at Coca-Cola angry with me.
*  Coca-Cola claimed that by 2023,
*  they were going to cut the amount of these particles
*  in half, but that would still make them 4.5 parts per
*  trillion, still much higher, at least four times higher
*  than any of the other brands.
*  So I have to be direct.
*  I'm just speaking from my own experience and choices
*  until I see data that Topo Chico has reduced
*  the amount of these foreign contaminants
*  to basically less than 0.31.
*  I'm going with San Pellegrino or Perrier.
*  Okay, I don't tend to drink a lot of mineral water,
*  but given that you're ordering it in the glass,
*  in a glass container, that is,
*  given that these things are not particularly cheap, right,
*  and that you have choices,
*  you could either decide to avoid carbonated water
*  altogether, or if you're going to be smart about it,
*  you probably want to avoid the ones that contain more
*  of these foreign contaminants because of their ability
*  to get lodged in different tissues in your body.
*  So that was very surprising to me that you would have
*  these forever chemicals in carbonated water.
*  What it tells us is that the water going into those
*  products contains either microplastics, nanoplastics,
*  PFASs from other sources or something.
*  And so I think that we should all be aware of this.
*  If you're going to drink carbonated water,
*  probably going with a Perrier or San Pellegrino
*  would be better than going with Topo Chico
*  because even though they've halved the amount
*  of these forever chemicals in there, it's still quite high.
*  Okay, so I've mentioned some to-do's to reduce your
*  microplastic, nanoplastic, BPA, BPS, and PFAS exposure,
*  such as ingesting cruciferous vegetables,
*  potentially supplementing with sulforaphane,
*  trying to avoid drinking out of plastic water bottles.
*  There are a few other things I'll just list off here
*  to keep it relatively short.
*  Talked about making sure you're getting
*  enough dietary fiber.
*  I talked before about using a glass or steel vessel
*  and reverse osmosis water, using Himalayan salt,
*  avoiding sea salt.
*  The other thing that you can do, oh, and I mentioned
*  using cast iron and ceramic as opposed to nonstick cookware
*  whenever you can.
*  And if you're going to microwave food,
*  making sure that you're doing that on plates
*  or in containers that does not or do not contain plastic
*  of any kind, even if it says microwave safe.
*  The other thing is to sweat, okay?
*  We vastly underestimate or downgrade the power of sweating.
*  Sweating is an incredible mechanism.
*  Now, I realized that as soon as somebody says
*  sweating is a great way to remove toxins from the body,
*  that a bunch of people out there get really inflamed,
*  pun intended.
*  I'm not saying that.
*  What I am saying is that there are a number of different ways
*  for foreign products to leave the body,
*  including urine, feces, but including sweat, okay?
*  So I'm not saying that's going to detox you completely.
*  That's not what I'm saying, okay?
*  I don't fall into that camp.
*  However, there are a number of beneficial aspects
*  to sweating and also there are a number of beneficial aspects
*  to doing the things that make you sweat.
*  So I've done entire episodes about deliberate heat exposure.
*  So things like sauna done anywhere from once a week
*  to four times a week, pretty impressive data
*  in terms of reducing all-cause mortality,
*  improving cardiovascular function.
*  It's also for most people pretty pleasant to sit in a sauna.
*  If you don't have access to a sauna, taking a hot bath,
*  not so hot that you burn yourself, but a hot bath
*  that also will activate some of these same pathways.
*  Things like hot yoga, things like going out for a run
*  in a hoodie, trying to get your body to sweat pretty robustly
*  at least once a week is a good idea
*  for all sorts of reasons.
*  Also just your ability to thermoregulate.
*  By the way, for those of you that don't sweat much,
*  sweating is actually something that you can get better at.
*  That's right.
*  You can get better at sweating by what?
*  By sweating, by exposing yourself in safe ways to heat.
*  And I talk about that
*  in the deliberate heat exposure episode.
*  We also have a newsletter on deliberate heat exposure.
*  I'll put links to those in the show note captions
*  and those explain safe ways to encourage sweating.
*  Why am I talking about this?
*  Well, sweating may help remove some of the things
*  that are attached to microplastics and nanoplastics
*  that can act as endocrine disruptors.
*  It's very, very unlikely that the microplastics
*  and nanoplastics would actually be removed
*  as whole particles in sweat.
*  I think that's very unlikely, frankly.
*  What's more likely is that the microplastics
*  and nanoplastics aren't really getting removed from
*  or broken down within our body at all.
*  They're getting lodged in these different tissues
*  but the stuff that's on them and in them
*  is potentially causing some of the biological harms
*  that we've talked about.
*  And so removing those more robustly
*  is what sweating is about.
*  It's what consuming cruciferous vegetables is about
*  and so on and so forth.
*  So those are a few more to do's.
*  The other two don'ts or I should say don'ts
*  are things like avoiding consumption of packaged food
*  or food that's packaged in plastic.
*  Now this is tough to do.
*  You know, I love berries for instance.
*  I love blueberries.
*  I'm what you call a drive by blueberry eater.
*  If there's blueberries in a bowl,
*  I just kind of like sweep them up by the fistful.
*  So if there are blueberries on the counter,
*  you're probably not getting very many.
*  I'm getting most of them.
*  I love blueberries,
*  but I noticed that I was starting to accumulate
*  and of course I recycle those blueberry containers
*  that are those plastic containers.
*  One way that you can avoid plastic packaging
*  is go to farmer's markets, bring your own bags,
*  bring your own baskets.
*  I love that the farmer's markets,
*  they have those cardboard containers.
*  Of course, some of you may be shouting,
*  wait, but those are colored green
*  and the coloration is a problem
*  and they have the microfibers with the, true,
*  but probably better than plastic containers
*  that they use now in the grocery store
*  for pretty much every fruit and vegetable.
*  Okay, so solution is either farmer's markets
*  or trying to bring your own bags to the grocery store.
*  I know this is starting to sound kind of hippie dippy,
*  but these little things make a big difference over time.
*  You're reducing your plastic waste.
*  You're reducing the amount of plastic exposure
*  of the fruits and vegetables you eat.
*  This can correspond to a real difference
*  in the number of microplastics and nanoplastics
*  and the bad stuff that comes with them that you ingest.
*  And again, most of the time,
*  these things are going to save you cost
*  as opposed to introduce new costs.
*  The other don'ts that we haven't talked so much about
*  are to reduce the number of clothes that you purchase.
*  I know this might seem like, oh my God,
*  where's this all going?
*  But it turns out that one of the major sources
*  of microplastics and nanoplastics
*  are the microfibers on clothing
*  that come off in washing machines
*  that then get distributed into the oceans
*  through the water or that escape into the air.
*  There are a number of ways that you can trap those.
*  There are the things like the guppy bag that you can,
*  I love the name, the guppy bag that you can buy
*  at pretty low cost.
*  You can find those easily online
*  that will trap some of that stuff.
*  There are filters that you can put
*  within specific washing machines.
*  Some places actually require this now
*  that capture those microfibers.
*  These microfibers, when I first heard about them,
*  I thought, oh goodness,
*  are we really talking about microfibers in clothing?
*  Well, just, I don't know, wear 100% cotton clothing.
*  But then you find out, because I read this book,
*  this scary book, and it is scary.
*  It does kind of bum you out
*  when you start reading this stuff,
*  that when you read a poison like no other,
*  how microplastics corrupted our planet and our bodies,
*  you find out that so much of the waste
*  that exists in landfills is clothing
*  that people have discarded.
*  And there was nothing wrong with that clothing.
*  The clothing has dyes, it has little microfibers.
*  This stuff gets into the environment,
*  gets into the oceans.
*  Here's the simple solution to all this.
*  It turns out that we replace far more clothing
*  than we need to.
*  Okay, this is actually a great relief to me
*  because I love few things more in terms of clothing anyway.
*  The feeling of a t-shirt that I've worn many, many times,
*  and it's really, really soft and kind of worn down,
*  that kind of distressed look t-shirt,
*  even though that might be fashionable to some people,
*  to some people it's not,
*  I love the feeling of a really worn down soft t-shirt,
*  even the ones that have a little bit of, you know,
*  sort of a jagged two thing along the collar.
*  Now, some people might loathe that.
*  They only want the pristine t-shirt that, you know,
*  is super crisp.
*  That's not me.
*  I know I own a few of these black button down shirts,
*  and indeed the same ones, I use them over and over again.
*  I do own a fair number of them,
*  but I use the same ones over and over again.
*  And I think that's in keeping with this other recommendation,
*  which this book, A Poison Like No Other,
*  said could make a major dent in the amount of microplastics
*  and nanoplastics that are out there in the environment
*  that we end up ingesting,
*  and that the other animals on the planet
*  who are so very important end up ingesting
*  and potentially suffering from.
*  And that's to simply not buy or replace
*  so much of our clothing, but to reuse our clothing.
*  Now, the argument has been made,
*  and they counter it in the book.
*  Well, then you're just going to wash
*  the same clothing over and over.
*  You're going to break down those microfibers
*  and introduce those dyes and things into the ocean,
*  et cetera, into the air.
*  But it turns out that when you reuse the same clothing
*  and wash it over and over again,
*  you actually see a diminishment in the amount
*  of microfibers and the amount of dyes and things
*  that you extract from those clothing over time.
*  Okay, so now in some odd way,
*  we're talking about clothing purchases or non-purchases
*  in this case on the Huberman Lab podcast.
*  But in researching this episode,
*  I discovered that these are a major source,
*  if not the major source of microplastic
*  and nanoplastic particles in the environment
*  and landfills, ocean, air, et cetera.
*  So while none of us, I believe none of us
*  are going to go out there and create a tire
*  that doesn't degrade as quickly as current tires, right?
*  Most of us don't have the capacity to do that.
*  Let's face it, we got to get around in vehicles,
*  all those tires breaking down,
*  not a whole lot we can do about that.
*  We're inhaling all that stuff,
*  but we can make the decision to use the clothing
*  that we've got for longer periods of time.
*  Is it really necessary to keep buying more and more clothes
*  and replacing the old clothes,
*  throwing out the old clothes
*  or even donating those old clothes?
*  Who knows?
*  I'm all for donating clothing after you're done with it,
*  but now I have justification
*  for just keeping the t-shirts that I have,
*  making them softer and softer and softer over time.
*  And I should mention that, of course,
*  when you wear clothing
*  that is shedding these microfiber particles,
*  you're ingesting or rather you're inhaling more typically
*  the microfibers and the microplastics and the nanoplastics
*  and all the bad goodies that go with them.
*  You know, as I say that,
*  I think we need to be fair about what that means
*  and what it doesn't mean.
*  I personally just don't see myself going around
*  and looking at labels,
*  finding only 100% cotton with no microfiber shedding,
*  no dyes, et cetera.
*  I mean, there are a lot of things
*  that are now introduced to even 100% cotton clothing
*  that make them a little bit more water and stain resistant.
*  It's very, very difficult
*  to find such sources of clothing, right?
*  I know they're out there,
*  but they're very difficult to find
*  and they're quite costly in many cases.
*  If you happen to know of some true low cost versions
*  of those things,
*  please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
*  But I think we have to be realistic here.
*  Plastics were introduced in the 1950s.
*  They are everywhere.
*  They are in our clothing.
*  They are in tires.
*  They are in medical devices.
*  They're just everywhere.
*  The point of this discussion today
*  is not to try and eliminate plastics.
*  I don't think that's reasonable.
*  I don't even think that would be useful
*  relative to the incredibly powerful use of plastics
*  in just about every industry.
*  There's always a trade-off with these sorts of things.
*  And I acknowledge that.
*  What I'm talking about is trying to limit your exposure
*  and trying to buffer yourself against this bioaccumulation
*  in ways that can protect your endocrine system,
*  protect your brain,
*  protect your cardiovascular system,
*  protect your liver,
*  protect the organs and tissue systems of your body
*  so that you can thrive as much as possible.
*  So there are some other not to do's or things to avoid.
*  Microwave popcorn turns out to be a major source
*  of these things.
*  Basically any bag or container,
*  can bag or plastic that has a lining
*  that prevents oily stuff from staining it
*  and getting through such as microwave popcorn,
*  very likely is a source,
*  or I should say a rich source of microplastics,
*  nanoplastics and endocrine disruptors.
*  Does that mean that if you have some microwave popcorn
*  every once in a while,
*  that's going to screw up your estrogen or testosterone system
*  and make you infertile?
*  No, I don't believe that.
*  These things are all a matter of dosage,
*  exposure over time and so on.
*  Toothpaste and plastic tubing,
*  another rich source of microplastics,
*  nanoplastics that people ingest,
*  of course, because you're putting it in your mouth.
*  When I did the oral health episode,
*  I talked about some tooth tablets.
*  I've become quite fond of these.
*  I have no financial relationship
*  to the company that makes these,
*  but these are tooth tablets
*  that include something called hydroxyapatite,
*  which is great for the remineralization of teeth,
*  because it turns out your teeth can fill in little cavities
*  that start to form and overall tooth health.
*  It's also great for travel,
*  because first of all, these things come in a glass jar,
*  so no plastic.
*  You take the tooth tablets,
*  you just chew them up and then you brush your teeth.
*  It's great because you don't have to worry
*  about how many ounces is going through
*  the screening process at the airport,
*  because it's not a liquid, it's not a paste,
*  it's a tablet, they're super convenient.
*  I love those.
*  We'll probably link to those in the show note captions,
*  even though I have no relationship to the company,
*  I'm just a big fan of that sort of thing,
*  the convenience and the fact that it's housed in glass.
*  But as I say all this stuff, right,
*  avoiding drinking out of plastic,
*  don't turn over your clothing so much,
*  wash your clothes, but don't purchase
*  and throw away clothing too much
*  or more than is necessary.
*  Avoiding sea salt, these kinds of things.
*  These are all just choices for you in the buffet of options
*  of ways to reduce your microplastic,
*  nanoplastic ingestion and exposure
*  and the bioaccumulation of those things over time
*  and to increase in the case of things like sulforaphane
*  and sweating, et cetera,
*  and to increase the detoxification and removal
*  of some of the more harmful products attached to
*  or within these microplastics and nanoplastics, right?
*  I certainly don't expect anyone, including myself,
*  to start living a life free of microplastics
*  and nanoplastics.
*  To do that, you'd probably have to leave planet Earth.
*  I know certain people are developing plans
*  to enable us to do that, even if we're not astronauts.
*  And frankly, when you get out to Mars
*  or you get it into outer space,
*  those microplastics and nanoplastics
*  based on everything I've learned
*  and how incredibly sneaky, small and pervasive they are,
*  well, they're probably in outer space as well.
*  Now, the final thing I want to touch on
*  is the potential role of microplastics, nanoplastics.
*  BPAs, BPSs and forever chemicals on the developing brain.
*  And this is an area that I'm very familiar with
*  because much of my career,
*  I've focused on brain development, neural development.
*  And one can find a lot of papers out there
*  about the potential neurotoxicity of micro and nanoplastics,
*  certainly the established neurotoxicity of microplastics
*  and nanoplastics in animal models
*  and the potential neurotoxicity
*  of those things in human tissues.
*  Now, of course, because this animal literature
*  and some correlative human literature
*  have been out there for a while,
*  the media and some people in particular
*  have become concerned about
*  and have mentioned the potential role
*  of microplastics and nanoplastics
*  and the bad goodies that attach to them or come from them
*  in potentially causing neurodevelopmental disorders
*  such as autism and ADHD.
*  I want to be very clear.
*  I went into this literature.
*  I read this review.
*  Quite nice review.
*  The plastic brain neurotoxicity of micro and nanoplastics.
*  And sure, there's a lot of animal literature
*  showing for instance, that there's a disruption
*  in certain enzymatic pathways within neurons in particular.
*  And this is the one that intrigues me the most,
*  a disruption in what's called acetylcholine esterase.
*  Acetylcholine is a neuromodulator
*  involved in neuroplasticity in a tension,
*  among other things, levels of alertness,
*  a number of things,
*  including control of the so-called neuromuscular junctions
*  that allow for us to move our limbs.
*  Acetylcholine esterase is involved in the degradation,
*  the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synapse.
*  So neurons release acetylcholine into the synapse
*  where it can have an effect on muscle
*  or it can have an effect on other neurons
*  if we're talking about within the brain.
*  And indeed, there's a fair amount of evidence
*  showing that microplastics and nanoplastics
*  are correlated with reductions in
*  or just changes in acetylcholine esterase activity.
*  Now it is true that where acetylcholine is released
*  in the brain, it can impinge on dopamine circuits
*  that are involved in reward pathways and movement.
*  But I want to be clear,
*  people have taken some of those findings,
*  translated them to the correlative data in humans,
*  and have started to link the presence of microplastics
*  and nanoplastics in their words, not mine,
*  in their words, to neurodevelopmental disorders
*  such as autism and ADHD.
*  And while there is some evidence
*  that some of the behavioral components
*  or cognitive components of autism and ADHD
*  may increase in line with increases
*  in microplastic or nanoplastic exposure,
*  the data there are still, in my opinion, very, very weak.
*  So in my opinion, it's far too early to conclude
*  that microplastics and nanoplastics have any role
*  and certainly not a causal role
*  in the development of autism or ADHD
*  or other neurodevelopmental disorders.
*  That said, the presence of microplastics
*  and nanoplastics in placenta
*  and in that first stool from babies,
*  which shows us that those microplastics and nanoplastics
*  are getting into the developing fetus,
*  well, that does, I think, raise level of concern.
*  And it certainly should motivate pregnant women
*  as well as people who have newborn kids
*  or are going to have kids
*  to look around their home environment,
*  think about the things they're putting into their body
*  or the vessels they're using to ingest liquids,
*  to ingest foods,
*  and to start limiting microplastic and nanoplastic exposure
*  certainly during, but also perhaps before pregnancy
*  and after pregnancy when one is breastfeeding.
*  So the point here is that we can't draw a direct relationship
*  between microplastics and nanoplastics
*  and neurodevelopmental disorders.
*  I don't think it would be appropriate at all to do that.
*  However, given that microplastics and nanoplastics
*  have these issues, both from their own breakdown,
*  their presence, right?
*  Their own structural presence can be a problem.
*  The chemicals within them can be a problem.
*  The chemicals that attach to them
*  can be a problem potentially.
*  I think learning to limit our exposure
*  throughout our lifespan,
*  learning to reduce the bioaccumulation
*  through detoxification and excretion pathways
*  using the various approaches that we talked about.
*  And certainly to pay extra attention to those things
*  around the time of, meaning before, during,
*  and after pregnancy is especially important
*  because we just don't know all the things
*  that these chemicals and these plastics are doing,
*  but none of them seem to be very good,
*  at least not in terms of the ways
*  that they impact our brain and bodily tissues.
*  Okay, so today we've talked a lot about microplastics,
*  what they are, where they're found,
*  how they get into our body,
*  where they get lodged within our body,
*  what they potentially do in our body,
*  none of which is good.
*  Some might be innocuous, some might be bad,
*  none of which, at least as far as I know, is good.
*  And some ways, both through some to-dos and some to avoids,
*  that we can increase our excretion or our breakdown
*  and removal of the bad stuff on and in microplastics
*  and nanoplastics.
*  And I realized that even though we covered a lot of things,
*  we also just scratched the surface.
*  For instance, we know that receipts
*  are rich sources of BPAs, okay?
*  So if you are somebody who handles receipts a lot
*  for your job, probably best to use nitrile gloves, okay?
*  Not latex gloves, but nitrile gloves.
*  Those are going to protect your hands.
*  If you're somebody who purchases things,
*  maybe just say, no thanks,
*  I'll take the electronic receipt or no receipt.
*  Okay, however, we need to be reasonable here as well.
*  Does this mean that if you touch a receipt
*  that you're going to screw up your testosterone or estrogen?
*  No, but you probably don't want to be rubbing those receipts.
*  And it's very clear that if you use sunscreen
*  or lotions of any kind on your hands, you handle receipts,
*  it can increase the access of those BPAs to your bloodstream.
*  And if you're somebody who handles receipts a lot,
*  well then probably best to use those nitrile gloves.
*  The point here is that there are a lot of different sources
*  of these BPAs, BPSs, PFAS, so-called forever chemicals,
*  microplastics, nanoplastics.
*  I also would just encourage you to do your research.
*  Look at the cans that you drink from.
*  Ensure that they don't include BPAs.
*  Look at the different things
*  that you cook within your kitchen.
*  Try and cook from cast iron or ceramic.
*  And if you don't, look at the other pans and cans
*  and things in your environment
*  and see what your likely exposure to these BPAs, BPSs
*  and forever chemicals is and make choices accordingly.
*  That's what today's episode
*  and frankly this podcast is about.
*  It's about you being informed and making the best choices
*  for your mental health and physical health.

*  For those of you that haven't heard,
*  I have a new book coming out.
*  It's my very first book.
*  It's entitled Protocols,
*  an Operating Manual for the Human Body.
*  This is a book that I've been working on
*  for more than five years
*  and that's based on more than 30 years
*  of research and experience.
*  And it covers protocols for everything from sleep
*  to exercise, to stress control,
*  protocols related to focus and motivation.
*  And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
*  for the protocols that are included.
*  The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
*  There you can find links to various vendors.
*  You can pick the one that you like best.
*  Again, the book is called Protocols,
*  an Operating Manual for the Human Body.
*  If you're not already following me on social media,
*  I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
*  So that's Instagram, X, formerly known as Twitter,
*  Threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
*  And on all those platforms,
*  I discuss science and science related tools,
*  some of which overlaps with the content
*  of the Huberman Lab podcast,
*  but much of which is distinct from the content
*  on the Huberman Lab podcast.
*  Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
*  If you haven't already subscribed
*  to our Neural Network Newsletter,
*  our Neural Network Newsletter
*  is a zero cost monthly newsletter
*  that includes podcast summaries,
*  as well as protocols in the form of brief
*  one to three page PDFs.
*  Those protocol PDFs are on things like neuroplasticity
*  and learning, optimizing dopamine, improving your sleep,
*  deliberate cold exposure, deliberate heat exposure.
*  We have a foundational fitness protocol
*  that describes a template routine
*  that includes cardiovascular training
*  and resistance training with sets and reps,
*  all backed by science,
*  and all of which again is completely zero cost.
*  To subscribe, simply go to hubermanlab.com,
*  go to the menu tab up in the upper right corner,
*  scroll down to newsletter and provide your email.
*  And I should emphasize
*  that we do not share your email with anybody.
*  Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion
*  all about microplastics and nanoplastics.
*  And last, but certainly not least,
*  thank you for your interest in science.
