# Dr. Martha Beck Access Your Best Self With Mind-Body Practices, Belief Testing & Imagination
**Andrew Huberman:** [August 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOgypsWKjm4)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
*  where we discuss science and science-based tools
*  for everyday life.
*  I'm Andrew Huberman,
*  and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
*  at Stanford School of Medicine.
*  My guest today is Dr. Martha Beck.
*  Dr. Martha Beck did her undergraduate master's
*  and PhD training at Harvard University.
*  She is also considered one of the foremost experts
*  in the personal development field,
*  having authored many bestselling books,
*  including her upcoming book, Beyond Anxiety,
*  Curiosity, Creativity, and Finding Your Life's Purpose.
*  I must say that today's discussion is a truly special one.
*  I've long benefited from Martha's teachings,
*  and I assure you that during today's episode,
*  you will benefit from Martha's teachings.
*  She describes and we explore practices in real time
*  that will allow you to truly understand
*  what is most important to you
*  and what you ought to spend your time pursuing.
*  You will hear a rich discussion
*  about how to frame the thoughts and the emotions
*  around any topic, including pain points in life,
*  as well as your goals and the things
*  that you are in pursuit of.
*  You will also learn how to figure out
*  exactly what is most essential to you,
*  and indeed how to explore
*  what Dr. Martha Beck calls your essential self,
*  those deep-rooted desires that are unique to you
*  and your history and what will make your life most fulfilling.
*  By the end of today's episode,
*  you will be armed with new intellectual
*  and practical knowledge,
*  and you will be able to adopt the best possible stance
*  for you as you navigate forward in your life.
*  Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
*  that this podcast is separate
*  from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
*  It is, however, part of my desire and effort
*  to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
*  and science-related tools to the general public.
*  In keeping with that theme,
*  I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
*  Our first sponsor is BetterHelp.
*  BetterHelp offers professional therapy
*  with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online.
*  I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years.
*  Initially, I didn't have a choice.
*  It was a condition of being allowed to stay in high school,
*  but pretty soon I realized that doing regular therapy
*  is extremely important to our overall health.
*  There are essentially three things
*  that go into great therapy.
*  First of all, you need to have great rapport
*  with a therapist.
*  So you need to be comfortable with that person.
*  You need to be able to trust them and talk to them
*  about all the issues that are relevant to you.
*  Second, and this is what people normally think of
*  when they think of a great therapist,
*  that therapist needs to provide you support
*  in the form of emotional support or directed guidance.
*  And third, excellent therapy
*  has to provide very useful insights,
*  insights that you can apply to be better,
*  not just in your emotional life, in your relationship life,
*  but also your relationship to yourself.
*  BetterHelp makes it extremely easy
*  to find an excellent therapist for you,
*  one with whom you resonate with, have excellent rapport with,
*  and that can give you
*  those three essential benefits of therapy.
*  If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
*  go to BetterHelp.com slash Huberman
*  to get 10% off your first month.
*  Again, that's BetterHelp.com slash Huberman.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
*  Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
*  that are customized to your unique sleep needs.
*  I've spoken many times before on this and other podcasts
*  about the fact that getting a great night's sleep
*  is the foundation of mental health,
*  physical health, and performance.
*  Now, the mattress we sleep on makes an enormous difference
*  in terms of the quality of sleep that we get each night.
*  We need a mattress that is matched
*  to our unique sleep needs,
*  one that is neither too soft nor too hard for you,
*  one that breathes well,
*  and that won't be too warm or too cold for you.
*  If you go to the Helix website,
*  you can take a brief two-minute quiz
*  and it asks you questions such as,
*  do you sleep on your back, your side, or your stomach?
*  Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
*  Things of that sort.
*  Maybe you know the answers to those questions,
*  maybe you don't.
*  Either way, Helix will match you
*  to the ideal mattress for you.
*  For me, that turned out to be the Dusk mattress, DUSK.
*  I've been sleeping on a Dusk mattress for, gosh,
*  no, more than four years.
*  And the sleep that I've been getting
*  is absolutely phenomenal.
*  If you'd like to try Helix,
*  you can go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman.
*  Take that brief two-minute sleep quiz
*  and Helix will match you to a mattress
*  that is customized to your unique sleep needs.
*  Right now, Helix is giving up to 25% off mattresses
*  and two free pillows.
*  Again, that's helixsleep.com slash Huberman
*  to get 25% off and two free pillows.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us
*  Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need
*  and nothing you don't.
*  That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium,
*  and potassium in the correct ratios, but no sugar.
*  Now, proper hydration is critical
*  for the optimal functioning of all the cells in your body.
*  And that's especially true for the neurons, the nerve cells.
*  In fact, we know that even a slight degree of dehydration
*  can diminish both cognitive and physical performance.
*  So to make sure that I'm getting proper hydration
*  and electrolytes, I personally dissolve one packet
*  of Element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
*  when I first wake up in the morning and I drink that
*  or sip that across the first half hour of the day or so.
*  And then I also make it a point to drink another packet
*  of Element dissolved in an equal amount of water.
*  So 16 to 32 ounces at some other point during the day
*  and maybe even a third if I'm exercising
*  and or sweating a lot.
*  I should mention that Element tastes absolutely delicious.
*  My favorite flavor is watermelon, although I also confess
*  I like the raspberry flavor, the citrus flavor.
*  Basically, I like all the flavors.
*  If you'd like to try Element, you can go to
*  drinkelement.com slash Huberman to claim a free Element
*  sample pack with the purchase of any Element drink mix.
*  Again, that's drinkelement.com slash Huberman
*  to claim a free sample pack.
*  And now for my discussion with Dr. Martha Beck.
*  Dr. Martha Beck, welcome.
*  Oh, it's so good to be here, Andrew.
*  Thank you.
*  I'm so excited.
*  I mean, I don't know how to convey to the people listening
*  and watching just how excited I am.
*  I have very few heroes in life, but you are one of them.
*  It's true.
*  That does not compute.
*  It's true.
*  I won't name all of them, but you, the great Oliver Sacks
*  are among the people that have really influenced me so much
*  in terms of the things I do, the ways I try and think,
*  the ways I try to not think at times.
*  And your life story is an amazing one.
*  We have a lot to cover today.
*  So I'm not going to spend any more time talking about
*  why I feel that way, because it's going to just become
*  apparent in our discussion.
*  But I do want to say that you have really been
*  ahead of your time.
*  I mean, you're triple-degree from Harvard.
*  You have these academic credentials, and yet you're one
*  of the first people to be public facing
*  about the mind-body connection in a way that is
*  operationalized, what we sometimes call
*  in and around this podcast, protocols.
*  And you've offered some practices that have absolutely
*  transformed my life and other people's lives.
*  And I gained them through reading your books,
*  and that's not a standard book advertisement,
*  but all of your books have been transformative for me.
*  One of the exercises that has had a profound effect
*  on my life is the perfect day exercise.
*  And when I first read about it, I thought,
*  what could this possibly be?
*  And as I recall, it involved taking a little bit of time,
*  maybe 10 minutes, maybe 30 minutes, and just sitting
*  or lying down, closing one's eyes, and just imagining,
*  with no limitations, one's perfect day.
*  And what's so wild about this exercise is that several,
*  not all, but several of the things that I imagined
*  in that exercise have amazingly come to be reality.
*  It works.
*  I don't know how or why it works, but I used to have people
*  send me a postcard, this is how long I've been doing
*  this stuff now, it's emails and texts that I'd say,
*  okay, we just did your ideal day,
*  you've got it all written down.
*  Now send me a notification when that day happens,
*  and I get a lot of notifications.
*  Well, I'm giving you a notification right now,
*  because at the end of that exercise,
*  and I ended up doing it several times.
*  I do it all the time.
*  Okay, that's good to know, I wanna know
*  about the frequency there, was I'd love to sit down
*  and talk to Martha Beck, what I wouldn't do.
*  So I'm in a pinch me moment right now.
*  This is so great.
*  It's wild, it's like reality weaving back on itself.
*  And I've listened to your podcast,
*  and I thought, that guy is really cool, and here I am.
*  Thank you, I'm moved by that.
*  So let's just talk about this exercise for a second.
*  Cool, yeah.
*  Clearly, we could come up with scientific explanations
*  for why it would work, the brain is a predictive machine,
*  once it understands that something might be possible,
*  maybe it looks for avenues for that unconsciously,
*  we could come up with a whole narrative around that.
*  But just for sake of those listening,
*  what is this exercise?
*  How would you suggest somebody try it?
*  So the first thing is that you don't make up something.
*  People would always tell me they'd make up a day
*  where they woke up in a white room with white sheets
*  and windows with white curtains,
*  and then they would put on white clothes and drift around.
*  And I realized finally that these people were just tired,
*  and they could not project anything
*  but a sort of blankness that I finally realized
*  meant that they just pushed themselves too hard.
*  So I stopped doing this with people
*  until they were well rested.
*  Then you don't make it up, you see it happen.
*  That's the key thing, you allow it into your mind,
*  not as though you're reaching with your imagination,
*  just as though it emerges.
*  So I talk people through it.
*  First thing is you wake up in the morning,
*  you're perfectly refreshed by a beautiful sleep.
*  In your imagination, don't open your eyes,
*  but listen, what do you hear?
*  So you don't make it up, you listen for it.
*  What do you hear?
*  For me, the first thing I hear is like
*  just feeling how comfortable my body is on the bed.
*  Something that I don't do enough.
*  What about the sound of someone or someone's breathing?
*  Yeah, someone next to me breathing,
*  and they're still asleep.
*  Ah, lovely.
*  Is there a dog breathing on the foot of the bed?
*  It was like my bulldog Costello that's snoring.
*  I'm gonna get another dog soon,
*  so I would like a dog that breathes
*  less snoring than Costello.
*  Although I must say I miss his-
*  Bulldogs.
*  His incredibly deep snores.
*  The early versions of this podcast, the early episodes,
*  we kept him in the room snoring.
*  And by the way, the watering up of my eyes,
*  these are truly tears of joy.
*  And I said at the beginning of the podcast,
*  I said, listen, I have a bulldog,
*  he's getting toward the end of his life,
*  so we're gonna keep him in the room.
*  And so when you hear that breathing in the background,
*  that snoring, let's call it what it is,
*  he's in here, so sorry, not sorry.
*  So anyway, so yeah, so there's some bulldog breathing.
*  And you can have as many dogs in the room as you want.
*  Just listen.
*  And maybe you hear birds outside, maybe you hear the ocean,
*  maybe you hear wind, maybe you hear people talking
*  or the noise of traffic.
*  Just listen for a minute
*  until you're pretty sure you've heard everything
*  there is to hear.
*  Yeah, I like the sound of kids playing.
*  Ah, sweet.
*  Okay, so smell the air.
*  What's it like?
*  How humid is it?
*  What's the temperature?
*  You know, I'm a Californian at heart.
*  I like it in the 70s and 80s.
*  Perfect.
*  Not too humid.
*  And I don't, it's weird that I don't jump in,
*  but there's something about the sound of airplanes
*  flying over that always depresses me.
*  It must be some paired association.
*  Sometime, like I don't like that.
*  Okay, no planes.
*  So birds, bird chirping, who doesn't like birds chirping?
*  And by the way, for our listeners,
*  this is not one magical day that you'll never live again.
*  This is a typical day, but your life is now perfect.
*  So it's an ordinary day, but in your perfect life.
*  So put it out three years, five years,
*  whatever makes it possible for you to allow
*  that your ideal life could form in that time.
*  You'll find as you do it many times,
*  the time necessary for it to happen becomes much shorter.
*  Anyway, so you get up, look around,
*  you sit up in the bed, look around, who's next to you?
*  What does the dog look like?
*  What does the room look like?
*  Yeah, it's my partner next to me.
*  My dog is, I told myself I wasn't gonna get another bulldog.
*  Oh, you are.
*  But I think I'm gonna get another bulldog.
*  They're the best.
*  They're like the essence of efficiency of metabolism,
*  meaning they do as little as possible.
*  And they experience as much joy as possible.
*  They're hedonists when it really comes down to it.
*  You need a wise hedonist in your life.
*  Right, and they are capable of protecting if they need to,
*  but I honestly don't care about that.
*  You know, all that stuff, like all that,
*  like my bulldogs, I don't care about any of that.
*  Something tells me you could protect yourself pretty well.
*  Yeah, I'm good there.
*  Look around the room, what color are the walls?
*  What pictures are hanging there, if any?
*  Yeah, I'm a Wyeth fan.
*  Andrew Wyeth fan.
*  Which one, Andrew or NC?
*  Well, recently I saw a caption,
*  I don't know if this is true,
*  because it was an Instagram post,
*  that the woman in the field image.
*  Christina's world.
*  That, yeah, I didn't know the name of it, thank you,
*  that this was a neighbor of theirs
*  that had a degenerative neural condition.
*  And rather than use a wheelchair of sorts,
*  she insisted on crawling everywhere.
*  And so that image is actually of her crawling out
*  into the field happily to enjoy the field.
*  I know.
*  Because my impression of the painting before was that
*  somehow because she's seated up there,
*  it looks like in my mind I projected onto it
*  that there's some like desperation there
*  or something to get back to the house,
*  but that's not it at all.
*  Turns out this is a woman who preferred to move
*  with her own agency, even if it meant crawling
*  to enjoy nature.
*  And it's a magnificent painting.
*  It's a magnificent painting.
*  So it's on the wall there.
*  Yes, maybe not the original,
*  although that would be awesome.
*  Why not?
*  It's your perfect life.
*  Then I'm waking up in the Met.
*  And also just notice that you're creating a theme,
*  which is, the theme is I will go out as myself
*  and I will reach and strive for things.
*  And I'm not here to be helped,
*  I'm here to do hard things
*  and to do them for the joy of it.
*  So that's what that painting is,
*  strong symbol of who you are.
*  So get out of the bed and your partner's still sleeping,
*  the dog's still sleeping.
*  Go look out the window, where are you?
*  And you can be anywhere.
*  I'm a mountains guy.
*  As much as I love California,
*  you know, I've realized that I just went out
*  to Boulder, Colorado for the first time for a week,
*  just by myself, and I fell in love with it.
*  Yeah.
*  So I'm in the mountains, Colorado feels right to me.
*  And there's water.
*  Like a river.
*  A river, they've got great rivers there.
*  Or the little streams.
*  I like the little streams that they have there,
*  because the rivers are so loud.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  The rivers are really loud when they get going.
*  Yeah.
*  And...
*  So are you looking at a small town, a city,
*  or do you just live out in the mountains by yourself?
*  Definitely small town.
*  I can't be too isolated.
*  If I'm going to be in a city, I'm going to be in Manhattan.
*  It's like, it's all or none.
*  So if I'm going to be in nature, I want to be in nature.
*  So a small town.
*  Beautiful.
*  So just look around, smell the pine, aspen air,
*  and then you go into your perfect bathroom, and it's all.
*  It's beautiful.
*  You could go through a lot of description if you wanted to,
*  but I'm going to rush through that
*  to get to the interesting parts.
*  So take a look at yourself in the mirror.
*  Your body is absolutely perfect.
*  Of course, in your case, that's not an aspirational thing.
*  You're already there.
*  But make it even better.
*  Yeah, for me, that means being clear-eyed.
*  People who listen to this podcast know that
*  I came up through neuroscience studying a number of things,
*  but the visual system, and these two little bits
*  in the front of our skull are pieces of our brain.
*  They're the only pieces of our brain outside of our skull.
*  And yes, they may be the windows to the soul
*  if people want to refer to them that way,
*  but to me, just feeling like my eyes are clear,
*  and there's a certain tone or something that I'm like,
*  okay, like I'm all there.
*  There is a real clarity.
*  I've seen it.
*  I don't know if you've worked with people who are dying
*  or who are really ill.
*  Sometimes you'll see a shift in the transparency
*  of their eyes.
*  There actually seems to be a radiance coming from the eyes
*  or gathered around the eyes.
*  That's what I'm sort of thinking as you talk.
*  Yeah, and I think it's the Buddhist that talked about
*  it's someone who's at the level of their eyes
*  or at the level of their skin, so like right there
*  as opposed to sunken back into their eyes.
*  Yes.
*  And then of course, some people are really
*  forward leaning. That's so interesting.
*  And I also happen to work on the intersection
*  between the visual system and the autonomic system.
*  So stress or calm, and I think what that's referring to,
*  and I'm speculating here, is where we are alert but calm.
*  So we're present, alert, but calm.
*  And of course that controls pupil size.
*  And all of this stuff I do believe has been understood
*  in other traditions and ancient traditions
*  through a kind of unconscious genius
*  where they're recognizing all the symbols integrated
*  of clarity of the eyes and level of the skin.
*  And of course we can measure the stuff in the lab,
*  but that's just isolating variables.
*  So for me, it's looking in the mirror
*  and I'm like, okay, my eyes are clear.
*  This is so interesting because my friend Liz Gilbert
*  of Eat, Pray, Love, Fame, she wrote something
*  before she was famous where she dressed as a man
*  for a week and walked around and she's tall
*  and broad-shouldered and has great chin
*  so she could look male.
*  And she got herself all dressed up male
*  and they faked a beard and everything.
*  And then she had her friends come
*  and a male friend said to her, no Liz,
*  pull yourself back six inches away from your own eyes.
*  And she did it.
*  And he said, now you're looking like a man.
*  And she walked around that way and she said
*  it was the loneliest, saddest week she's ever experienced.
*  Like, yeah, people gave her more respect in certain ways,
*  but she said when they told me to back away
*  from my own eyes, it was like my soul went dim.
*  And that's really, really interesting
*  that you would say that exact distance.
*  It's like a retraction of our humanness.
*  That's fascinating.
*  I mean, I don't ever recall as a kid,
*  my dad or my mom or anyone telling me
*  like where to place my vision.
*  No, no, no, it's not articulated.
*  And I'm probably guilty of being more expressive,
*  emotional, effusive than certainly
*  the traditional male stereotype.
*  Like if I love something, people are gonna hear about it.
*  And I'm not shy about the fact that thinking about Costello
*  or my graduate advisor or people I love,
*  like I'll well up and I'm okay with that.
*  But I think, well, to flip that one around,
*  do you think that that's a real thing?
*  I have no idea.
*  Do cultural conditioning that men and women
*  tend to kind of be either more,
*  I don't know, there's no language for this.
*  I have an N of two, you and Liz Gilbert.
*  But I think it's very interesting that you said that,
*  that your forward and your eyes
*  and the idea that the eyes are the parts of our brains
*  that are showing.
*  It's fascinating that she had that experience too.
*  So I would love to, I'll be asking people from now on,
*  if you're designated male, identified male,
*  do you feel you have to pull your sort of vitality
*  back from the world?
*  And I suspect it's true.
*  I suspect it's true just from interacting with people.
*  And ask women if they, I think it's more vulnerable
*  to be right on the surface of your life
*  and in the surface of your eyes, but it's also much more,
*  there's a sensuousness to the world
*  when you're fully present that I know I had to shut down
*  like when I was in the Ivy League,
*  I had to pull myself back and sink down
*  and that's a typically male environment.
*  I think it's about materialism and conquest
*  and oppositional thinking as much as gender.
*  It's very tactical.
*  Yes, yeah, it's a tactical.
*  It's like taking what's out there and holding it in.
*  I actually can do it, I know how to do this.
*  You just did it.
*  Yeah, I know how to do this.
*  It's like visible.
*  Yeah, I probably just learned how to do it, right?
*  Wow.
*  Because I'm comfortable in a lot of different environments.
*  There are certainly environments
*  I don't want to find myself in again
*  or in the future for the first time,
*  but yeah, I'm very, very aware
*  with that distinct change in internal state
*  that accompanies that.
*  That's so, that was so interesting that you just did that.
*  Wow, okay.
*  But the problem I'm having now is that I have,
*  and I quote, an interest-based attention system.
*  I love that. ADHD,
*  which means I pay attention to things that interest me,
*  which means that I literally follow squirrels
*  away from business meetings.
*  I have paper and pen here, and it's okay,
*  because the art of podcasting, in my opinion,
*  is that we can spin a couple different plates
*  and return to them, because it's like conversation.
*  Otherwise, we might as well be on a highly-produced
*  traditional media show, and that's not what this is.
*  Shaw, I say.
*  So we're back, so I look in the mirror and I see,
*  I'm like, clear, like I'm clear and present.
*  And of course, for those listening,
*  you should all be doing this exercise for you, right?
*  Yes. Okay.
*  Okay.
*  And now you go to your closet
*  and you're gonna get dressed.
*  Open your closet, which is the closet of clothing
*  you have in your ideal life,
*  and just look at the different outfits you have.
*  The different, like how many kinds of shoes are there?
*  This is pretty funny,
*  because I definitely have my ideal wardrobe,
*  which is very sparse.
*  I've always owned 20 or so of these
*  button-down black shirts.
*  For work purposes, I like t-shirts that are super soft,
*  and because I have a short torso and long arms,
*  they have to fit right,
*  so I find the ones that fit right.
*  It's a nightmare trying to get them,
*  but once I get them, I adore them,
*  because I always own two belts or so,
*  one watch, black jeans.
*  The shorts I like, I get teased for wearing mailman shorts,
*  but they're actually the Costco-purchased mail,
*  or Kmart-purchased mail person shorts,
*  they fit best for me,
*  and I've always worn Adidas.
*  Yeah, no dress shoes?
*  Oh yeah, I own a pair of proper leather shoes,
*  I have a suit, I actually own a tuxedo.
*  Oh my.
*  I own those things, and I like my closet.
*  I've always liked it, it feels very safe in there.
*  I like it, and then I've always kept a couple photographs
*  of people that I love in my closet.
*  Oh, sweet.
*  So whose photographs are there?
*  Do you see any photographs you don't recognize
*  at this moment?
*  It's my sister, it's my grandfather,
*  and then I think that's it.
*  Yeah, don't think it up.
*  Apologies to my parents.
*  Yeah, everybody else.
*  Apologies to my parents and anyone else,
*  please forgive me, okay.
*  Okay, so then you go through the whole day,
*  and I can spend at least an hour going through this
*  with someone, and the important thing is that
*  you do something I call the three N's.
*  You notice what comes into the field of your imagination,
*  but you don't try too hard to see it specifically,
*  and then as you go through, you sort of narrow down
*  what it might be, and if the name of that thing comes up,
*  you can then name it.
*  But for example, in one of my ideal days,
*  I was writing short pieces of writing,
*  and I was interacting with people very regularly about it,
*  and I couldn't even imagine what kind of job that was,
*  and then an editor in Manhattan knocked over
*  a manuscript I'd written, and she was the editor
*  of a women's magazine, and she called me
*  and asked me to be a columnist.
*  I was like, all right, so I was a magazine columnist
*  for like 20 years, and it was exactly what was
*  in the ideal day, but I had not named it.
*  I didn't know that you could live in Phoenix
*  and be a columnist for New York magazines.
*  So notice what you're doing.
*  You put on your very comfy T-shirt, very cool black jeans.
*  You're one-watch, you're belt, you're adidas,
*  and you go do something really fun with people
*  you really love in a place you really enjoy.
*  Well, the work part of my life, quote unquote work,
*  is like reading and teaching and talking about stuff
*  on the internet, which is podcasting,
*  but what I got a flash of is I'd want to work
*  on my fish tanks with my kids.
*  Oh yeah, see now I skipped a thing.
*  You're supposed to go down to breakfast
*  and see if you've got a family.
*  I do.
*  Yeah, I've always wanted kids.
*  Been trying to time that correctly.
*  And with the right person.
*  So yeah, I like tending to my fish tanks.
*  I have kept fish tanks since I was a kid.
*  I haven't had one for a few years now,
*  but I'm always setting them up for other people.
*  It's kind of interesting.
*  I always go play in real life.
*  I go see people, I'm like,
*  I'm gonna put a fish tank there.
*  I don't know, it's always- My interest-based
*  attention system just went,
*  oh really, you do it for other people?
*  Oh yeah, I'll show up and I'll be like,
*  will you let me?
*  And then I'll set it up.
*  I love setting up fish tanks.
*  It's like the, who knows?
*  So your kids are helping you?
*  How many kids are there?
*  Realistically?
*  No, in your imagination.
*  You can have 20 if you want.
*  Two, two.
*  For some reason I got obsessed with numbers for a while,
*  but I was thinking like five or something, no, two.
*  You never know, it could happen.
*  The important thing about this exercise
*  is you don't get logical about it.
*  You don't think what's manageable and what's probable.
*  You just see who's there.
*  Yeah, two feels good.
*  All right, fair enough.
*  Two feels good.
*  And yeah, there's so much life in a fish tank.
*  There's the plants, there's the food,
*  there's how the fish are interacting with one another,
*  who's chasing who, who's nibbling, who's hiding,
*  who's dominant, who's being kind of unruly.
*  And I must have seen the Finding Nemo movie,
*  especially the second one, like 12 times.
*  Fabulous.
*  12 times, it's crazy, as an adult.
*  It's not crazy, this is wonderful.
*  So good, like I just love the personalities.
*  I mean, any movie where Willem Dafoe,
*  the voice of a fish, you're like, okay.
*  Like, so, all right, so we tend to the fish tanks,
*  which is great, which is great pleasure.
*  And then for me, it's, it would be come here
*  and sit down with you and hang out with these guys.
*  Hang out with these guys and my team
*  and share what I like know to be really cool,
*  like truly useful practices.
*  Fabulous.
*  So you're very, very close to your ideal day right now.
*  But, and as you said, I don't know the mechanisms
*  that get put in play.
*  Certainly directed attention,
*  that you're now like a guided missile
*  that knows where its target is,
*  or at least what the target looks like.
*  And we all make countless decisions every day.
*  And you can think of it as a lot of little whys
*  branching out.
*  And if you've got this in your mind really clearly,
*  you're gonna take the option that leads to it.
*  That's what I tell people, it's logical,
*  directed attention, except that in many cases,
*  I have to say a miracle occurs.
*  You know, my favorite cartoon is this physics equation
*  with these two physicists.
*  And there are all these symbols on both sides of the board
*  in the middle in brackets, it says a miracle occurs.
*  I love it.
*  My dad's a theoretical physicist.
*  So he will, but he will delight in that.
*  As many of you know, I've been taking AG1
*  for more than 10 years now.
*  So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.
*  To be clear, I don't take AG1 because they're a sponsor,
*  rather they are a sponsor because I take AG1.
*  In fact, I take AG1 once and often twice every single day.
*  And I've done that since starting way back in 2012.
*  There is so much conflicting information out there nowadays
*  about what proper nutrition is.
*  But here's what there seems to be a general consensus on.
*  Whether you're an omnivore, a carnivore,
*  a vegetarian or a vegan, I think it's generally agreed
*  that you should get most of your food from unprocessed
*  or minimally processed sources,
*  which allows you to eat enough, but not overeat,
*  get plenty of vitamins and minerals, probiotics
*  and micronutrients that we all need
*  for physical and mental health.
*  Now, I personally am an omnivore
*  and I strive to get most of my food from unprocessed
*  or minimally processed sources.
*  But the reason I still take AG1 once
*  and often twice every day is that it ensures
*  I get all of those vitamins, minerals, probiotics, et cetera,
*  but it also has adaptogens to help me cope with stress.
*  It's basically a nutritional insurance policy
*  meant to augment, not replace quality food.
*  So by drinking a serving of AG1 in the morning
*  and again in the afternoon or evening,
*  I cover all of my foundational nutritional needs.
*  And I, like so many other people that take AG1,
*  report feeling much better in a number of important ways,
*  such as energy levels, digestion, sleep and more.
*  So while many supplements out there are really directed
*  towards obtaining one specific outcome,
*  AG1 is foundational nutrition designed to support
*  all aspects of wellbeing related to mental health
*  and physical health.
*  If you'd like to try AG1,
*  you can go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman
*  to claim a special offer.
*  They'll give you five free travel packs with your order
*  plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
*  Again, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman.
*  There was something that popped to mind.
*  I mean, there are all these little things
*  that also go into my perfect day
*  that we don't have to go into every detail
*  about like working out and the whole thing.
*  But I just want to maybe mention a point of contrast
*  that served as one of the reasons why I did this practice
*  in the first place was that in real life,
*  I was waking up and sometimes still do wake up
*  with this like underlying like tension,
*  like something's not right.
*  I don't feel good.
*  I wasn't anxious.
*  I wasn't like, but like something's not right.
*  And I went through years of kind of like gnawing
*  and scratching at different things that,
*  I quickly discovered like going out for a couple drinks
*  with people made me feel worse.
*  I don't judge people who drink whatsoever.
*  I'm like, I don't like this.
*  Like it doesn't, like I was just, but this unease,
*  it's like a restlessness that lived inside of me
*  for so long and still can surface as a signal
*  that like, this is not the right life.
*  And at that point, at a laboratory, grants,
*  we're publishing papers,
*  like all these things that I loved doing
*  and that I loved the trajectory that I took to arrive there
*  and the people that were in my life.
*  But like, I just knew, I could just say like,
*  something's not right.
*  And I felt terribly guilty.
*  The reason I'm telling this is I felt terribly guilty.
*  Like I owned a home, right?
*  I was in my mid thirties and it wasn't an expensive home.
*  Certainly not by today's standards,
*  but I was able to buy a home on my own.
*  I was, and my dog, I had, you know, people in my life,
*  but it was like this,
*  it was almost like a gear that was grinding.
*  And that was the stimulus for exploring this perfect day.
*  My life looks completely different now.
*  And it's far from, quote unquote, perfect,
*  meaning there's still work to do in a lot of domains, a lot,
*  but I feel like the trajectory is right.
*  Yeah.
*  And I really believe the source of all my work,
*  you know, I was getting my doctorate at Harvard.
*  I'd gotten my bachelor's there.
*  I'd been there since I was 17.
*  And halfway through my doctorate,
*  during that time, I'd gotten married, had a child.
*  My second child was prenatally diagnosed with Down syndrome.
*  And I was six months into the pregnancy almost.
*  And I had like two weeks to make a decision.
*  And I'm politically very pro-choice.
*  And I wouldn't, again, never judge anyone
*  who made the other decision, but I couldn't do it.
*  I was already sort of bonded to him.
*  And I kept asking the question of myself,
*  what makes a human life worth living?
*  Because the doctors at the Harvard Medical Clinic
*  and all my advisors told me, you have got to,
*  at the very least, institutionalize this child
*  the second he's born.
*  Institutionalize.
*  Oh yeah, for sure.
*  They said, you're throwing your career away.
*  The head of the obstetrics committee,
*  there were five obstetricians,
*  and the chief dude came in,
*  and there I was sitting on a bed
*  in my little hospital napkin.
*  And he said, this is like a cancerous tumor.
*  You've got to let us take it out.
*  It will ruin your life.
*  And I just looked at him,
*  and I had the weirdest experience I had ever.
*  I looked at this very intimidating guy,
*  and I'm there sort of young and naked and pregnant.
*  And suddenly it was like I could see two faces on him.
*  And one was this very stern, knowledgeable doctor.
*  And the other one was a terrified child.
*  Terrified.
*  And it was so striking that I started
*  looking at him strangely.
*  I'm sure he thought I was completely nuts.
*  But I looked at him and I thought, you're afraid.
*  You're afraid of this baby.
*  And I realized, that's when I realized
*  that a lot of people don't go to Harvard
*  because they know they're smart.
*  They go there because they're afraid they're stupid.
*  And he was-
*  Probably true for a lot of higher education institutions.
*  And I thought he's afraid of the, in quotes,
*  stupid little boy inside me,
*  because he's afraid of the stupid little boy inside him.
*  He's terrified of being the person
*  he's worked so hard not to be.
*  He's afraid of being like my son.
*  And he thinks that should be thrown away.
*  And that was the point at which I said,
*  I will not make my decisions based on social pressure.
*  I have to do something from a very, very deep place within.
*  And so I kept that, I mean, he's home right now.
*  We're having a great time.
*  Adam. Adam, my son Adam.
*  I only know his name through your books, of course,
*  but I feel like I know him a little bit.
*  Because I love the story about him peeing on the doctor.
*  Yes, the very first thing I ever did in this life
*  was the doctor pulled him out of my body.
*  And I saw this arc of urine go straight into the doctor's face
*  and I was so proud of my child at that moment.
*  I thought if only I thought to do that.
*  I want to just, for lack of a better way to put it,
*  double click on two things.
*  First of all, I wonder if we're going to speculate, no need to,
*  but if the Perfect Day exercise is really
*  about accessing the subconscious.
*  That's why I told that long story.
*  That when I had to make that decision,
*  it was the first time I had dropped everything conscious
*  and logical from my mind and come from a place that was,
*  I believe it's part of our neurological apparatus,
*  but the cognitive structures are so,
*  you know, cognitive function is just a tiny fraction
*  of what our whole nervous systems are
*  able to detect and tell us.
*  And for the first time, I was making a decision
*  from every cell in my body instead of just my,
*  you know, neocortex.
*  And I realized my life is not meant to go like his life
*  and the person in the next bed,
*  their life isn't meant to be like mine,
*  but we all have this programmed into us somehow.
*  And when we start to leave it, in my last book,
*  I called it Leaving Our Integrity,
*  because to be an integrity just means to be one thing.
*  It doesn't have any moral implications
*  in the original, like Latin, it just means integer,
*  one thing.
*  So if we, we're born knowing who we are,
*  but at some point, usually not long after birth,
*  we get socialized away from what,
*  from expressing exactly what our own truth is telling us.
*  We get socialized to behave in ways
*  that please other people, very simple.
*  And as you're describing it, I had a great life.
*  I had a lab, I had a dog, I had a house.
*  Those are all socially recognized items
*  that say your life is working,
*  but they have nothing to do with your personal destiny.
*  Right, and in my case, again, I loved,
*  and I still love doing science.
*  I mean, my lab has certainly shrunk.
*  Everyone, I got it, made sure people got placed in jobs
*  and faculty positions, et cetera.
*  Still involved in some clinical trials,
*  but one thing that pained me about the work,
*  I'll just come clean about this,
*  makes my throat lock up a bit,
*  is I've been an animal lover since I was a kid.
*  I do eat meat, I eat it from sustainable sources,
*  but not all, but a lot of the work that I did
*  in my laboratory was on animals.
*  And at some point, it was approximately halfway
*  through my first position, I realized,
*  I was like, I don't like this.
*  And we could talk all day about animal research,
*  non-animal research, I decided to work on humans instead,
*  because they can consent and they house themselves.
*  But, so there were some pain points,
*  but I think my unconscious was pulling at me.
*  Like this isn't good, this isn't good, for me.
*  And I do think that the conscious mind
*  and the logical mind, as you're referring to it,
*  it's very tactical, and part of the problem
*  is it works so well, works in quotes,
*  to move us forward on metrics related to that.
*  Exactly.
*  But, I mean, there are very few people that I know
*  who are truly aligned with their,
*  I guess what you've called, essential self.
*  One who I'm fortunate to be good friends with,
*  he just so happens to be famous, for lack of a better word,
*  who resonates with a lot of what we're discussing
*  is the great Rick Rubin, the music producer
*  who's produced all these different types of music.
*  And one thing that's really interesting about Rick,
*  I've spent a lot of time with Rick,
*  and communicate all the time.
*  And one thing that is very interesting about him
*  is he has incredible powers of observation.
*  He can really feel the energy of a musical artist,
*  and he's produced other things too.
*  He does great documentary, he's got his own great podcast,
*  but he doesn't get absorbed by it.
*  And I wanted to talk to you about this
*  because I think for people that are very feeling,
*  very sentient, or really in touch with that,
*  the ability to feel music,
*  to feel other people's emotions,
*  to really, that's a beautiful life, to taste food.
*  But there's a threshold beyond which we kind of lose
*  ourselves in the experience of others and what's going on.
*  Rick can go right up to that line,
*  and really see it and enjoy it, but it doesn't absorb him
*  in a way that he has a place that he returns to
*  that's in him.
*  And the reason I discovered this is I said,
*  wait, you don't drink alcohol.
*  He said, no.
*  I said, no drugs.
*  He said, no, doesn't judge it, but he doesn't do it.
*  I said, did you ever?
*  He said, no.
*  And I said, who comes up through music
*  and never takes a sip of alcohol,
*  goes to college and never took a sip of alcohol,
*  tried any drug.
*  And again, I don't judge.
*  I've talked about psychedelics on this podcast.
*  I've talked about my own relationship to those,
*  what I think are very interesting clinical trials
*  and things of that sort.
*  I think there's tremendous potential there.
*  I agree.
*  But what is it to be able to experience life
*  in the richest way, but make sure that we don't get
*  lost in feeling or in thought?
*  It's like this ability to move back and forth
*  seems to be the best definition of like a great life,
*  in my opinion, because we need to do things each day.
*  You don't even have to go back and forth.
*  You can do it all at once.
*  You can feel, you can think, and you can stay
*  in the driver's seat and not be overwhelmed,
*  either intellectually or emotionally.
*  But I think it has a lot to do,
*  you were talking about Asian Eastern meditation practices.
*  There's a little exercise I like to do with people
*  where if they're struggling with a bad habit,
*  I say, imagine the part of you that is always
*  doing the bad thing, like smoking 20 packs a day
*  or whatever.
*  Imagine them as a wild thing in your left hand.
*  And then imagine the part of you that hates them
*  and says, stop smoking, in your right hand,
*  and look at them and begin to see
*  that they're both well-meaning, they're both exhausted,
*  and you can wish them both well.
*  So the wild child part is not thinking, it's just feeling.
*  The controlling part is not feeling, it's just thinking.
*  And if I can get people, and I have them put their hands out
*  because I know it's gonna activate both sides
*  of their brains, and then I have them wish these people well,
*  may you be well, may you be happy.
*  When they can feel compassion for both sides of themselves,
*  then I ask them, so who are you?
*  And who they've become is a compassionate witness,
*  which is not thinking, and it's not feeling
*  in the way we think.
*  It's not emotional.
*  Emovar, the word emotion means movement, disturbance.
*  This part of one's being is not ever disturbed or moved.
*  It's totally still and totally peaceful
*  and completely compassionate.
*  It's like the ultimate parent.
*  Yes, it is.
*  And Dick Schwartz, who came up with the model
*  of internal family systems theory,
*  I don't know if you've had him on the show.
*  Have not, but I'm learning more
*  about internal family systems models.
*  I learned about this first in the context
*  of visiting a trauma healing center.
*  That's great for trauma.
*  And then people are now applying this to addiction as well.
*  I'll get his name from you later.
*  Richard Schwartz.
*  Anyway, I was talking to him and he said,
*  there is this part, we all have different parts.
*  There's a part of you that feels like a little kid
*  and wants to curl up in bed.
*  There's a part of you that wants to go rule the world,
*  whatever your parts are.
*  So he talks to people about these different parts.
*  And then sometimes they say, oh, there's,
*  I've just come up against, there's someone here
*  who's very still, who's very huge, who's very kind.
*  And he calls itself with a capital S.
*  And he says, after thousands of patients,
*  they'll say, what part of you is that?
*  And they say, oh, this isn't a part like the others.
*  This is who I am.
*  This is who I am.
*  And he believes that it's just one unified self.
*  And for me, if I don't find and lock into that self,
*  I am immediately swept away by my emotions and my brain,
*  just like in a gale force winds.
*  So I have to be very, not grounded, but centered
*  and identified with this self
*  before I can even leave the house.
*  How do you go about doing that?
*  And one of the reasons I'm asking this
*  is because I think everyone, including myself,
*  would do well to be able to access
*  this compassionate witness self,
*  but also because so many people
*  are on social media nowadays,
*  where you can almost feel yourself getting pulled down
*  these trajectories, like the gravitational pull
*  of a battle or a video or even something that's delightful,
*  but then you find like two hours went by
*  and you were over consumed and under created in some sense.
*  It's like junk food.
*  It tastes delicious, but then you feel like that.
*  And it goes nowhere.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, it's the sort of goes nowhere.
*  So do you have a practice that you use
*  to make sure that you're in that place?
*  I do, and it's called suffering.
*  It's very reliable.
*  Oh, that made me laugh.
*  My best friend, suffering.
*  I have a deeply love hate relationship with suffering.
*  If I'm, for example, I can barely look at Instagram
*  because I will watch a monkey nursing a kitten
*  and then I will be down that rabbit hole so far.
*  You and me both.
*  Eight hours later, I'm, but I will start to suffer.
*  I will start to physically feel cramped.
*  My eyes will start to hurt in water
*  and I will start to feel what you were saying,
*  the grinding of the gear that is wrong.
*  The machine isn't, it's not in structural integrity.
*  It's like when your car starts making a funny sound
*  and you're like, I should not ignore that.
*  And it always feels like discomfort, tension, anxiety,
*  anger, any of those things.
*  And then the practice of my life
*  is to notice those sensations at a finer
*  and more granular level so that the moment I'm off true,
*  I can stop and say, okay, whoo, out of integrity.
*  Okay, now I'm into anxiety
*  because a divided person is always anxious.
*  So to get away from that, from anxiety and back to true,
*  I use the body, sit back, straighten my spine,
*  take a deep breath, do all the things
*  that I'm sure you do when you meditate.
*  And then I sink into that part of myself
*  that I was just trying to pull up
*  for people with the two hands exercise.
*  And I believe, you could probably tell me the truth of this,
*  I believe that I've wired a pretty strong super high worry
*  in my brain that goes, oops, suffering,
*  find self with a capital S.
*  And I've done it so many thousands of times
*  that I think I have like a highly myelinated circuit
*  that just goes there, shoo.
*  And then no matter what's happening,
*  I can usually just find it, feel it.
*  And it's an exquisite sensation.
*  It's like coming home completely over and over again.
*  It's, oh.
*  And now when I do an ideal day,
*  everything else is incidental.
*  The key is I'm in that self.
*  So the state is what's key.
*  Yes, and it is so, it has so much fun in this world.
*  And so you can walk around in that state.
*  Oh yeah, sure.
*  So to be sure I understand,
*  so say I wake up in the morning
*  and I'm just like not feeling right,
*  or something triggers me, or I don't know,
*  just like I'm off center.
*  Right.
*  You take that sensation of suffering.
*  Yeah.
*  And you don't fear it, you don't amplify it.
*  You just kind of pay attention to it.
*  You pay attention to it.
*  And here is the key thing.
*  This is in my new book.
*  I kept this a secret because it sounded so silly.
*  And I thought this would never go in the Ivy league.
*  But there's something I call KIST, K-I-S-T,
*  and it stands for kind internal self-talk.
*  So what do you call yourself when you think to yourself?
*  Andrew, Andy, what do you call yourself?
*  You.
*  Yeah, just, yeah.
*  So you'd be sitting there and you get,
*  you don't feel good, you don't feel right.
*  The first thing you do is allow yourself
*  to register every sensation without pushing back,
*  without restricting it.
*  People talk to me about bringing down their anxiety.
*  And I say, how do you feel if I told you
*  I was gonna bring you down?
*  That's not a nice thing to say.
*  If I told you I'm here to understand you
*  and care about you, better.
*  So just allow yourself to feel all the suffering
*  and then start saying kind things
*  to the one who is suffering,
*  even if it's just tiny suffering.
*  Just go, how are you?
*  How you doing?
*  Not great?
*  Okay, so there's some anxiety.
*  Oh, your sinuses are blocked too.
*  Let's see, what could we do for you?
*  Let's get you a hot drink
*  and like a call with a good friend
*  or a book or something.
*  And you just actively work as your own caregiver
*  from the moment you are conscious in the morning.
*  And what that does is it makes you so compassionate
*  to other people,
*  because you're not fighting the suffering in yourself.
*  Yeah, people in pain are usually agitated and grumpy.
*  So it's the inverse of that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I love this.
*  I mean, in some sense, the words like self-parenting
*  keep coming up in my mind,
*  because a lot of this is about learning to parent ourselves
*  from the inside.
*  And I do think that most,
*  we hear about inner child stuff
*  and I think inner child work is very interesting.
*  I also think that as a biologist
*  who spent the early part of my career
*  on developmental neurobiology,
*  like the same neural stuff is repurposed in adulthood.
*  That's something that it's kind of obvious,
*  but we overlook.
*  Right, I'm like,
*  I've got some inner adults here who aren't very happy too.
*  Right, right, right.
*  But the notion that our attachments when we're young,
*  somehow that those neural circuits are set aside,
*  so then we can form more mature adult attachments.
*  It's like, no, it's crazy.
*  We repurpose them.
*  So we're working in an adult landscape
*  with child-based algorithms.
*  And depending on how childhood went,
*  that either can be spectacular or so-so
*  or a complete disaster.
*  Usually it's a combination.
*  That obstetrician at Harvard,
*  I would bet my last dime
*  that he was still working on the same circuits
*  he used when he was five,
*  and they were pretty scary.
*  So yeah, we all have multiple causes of suffering,
*  but we also have,
*  I wouldn't actually call it inner parenting,
*  because that basically implies
*  that only parents give that to children.
*  And I think it's just humaning.
*  If you are truly humane,
*  if you are truly in a state of self with a capital S,
*  there is nothing in you
*  that wants to cause suffering for any other being.
*  And there's nothing in you that doesn't wanna help
*  ease the suffering of the entire world.
*  So again, now I'm into a kind of Asian modality of,
*  there's this Bodhisattva prayer that goes,
*  for as long as space endures
*  and as long as sentient beings exist,
*  may I also abide that I might heal with my heart
*  the miseries of the world.
*  And that part of us is in everyone.
*  And if we become those people,
*  it won't just be parents being kind to children,
*  it will be humans being kind to each other,
*  the earth and all other beings.
*  And we may actually make it into another century.
*  Yeah, no, it's looking a little sketchy right now.
*  I mean, things are tense.
*  It sounds like it starts with self love, compassion,
*  like only from that place of compassionate witness,
*  self with a capital S, excuse me,
*  can we be at our best for others.
*  I believe it's actually the only part of us that's real.
*  And I talked a minute ago about people who are dying,
*  they drop the pretense,
*  they don't need the pretense of belonging
*  to the material world or the material body anymore.
*  And that radiance begins to gather in their eyes.
*  And it's not new, it's what they came in with.
*  If you've looked into the eyes of a young child,
*  a little baby, you see the same thing.
*  And it's only when people die
*  that they put down everything else.
*  Unless as Eckhart Tolle says,
*  you die before you die and learn that there is no death.
*  Because that self does not feel physical.
*  It feels metaphysical.
*  Let's, if you would, let's drill into this a little bit more
*  because this is a high level,
*  but at the same time basic and yet abstract concept.
*  And it's not often on this podcast
*  that we talk about abstract concepts.
*  We probably don't do it enough.
*  We get like, I like talk about protocols,
*  you get your sunlight on clear days,
*  and I love that stuff too.
*  But as probably people realize by now,
*  I think a great life is bridging as many things,
*  at least for me as possible
*  and seeing the overlap in the Venn diagrams.
*  So it's the only part of us that's real,
*  meaning the other parts are just conditioned.
*  I think you've said-
*  The other parts are impermanent.
*  They will vanish.
*  Everything, as Shakespeare says,
*  everything will just disappear and leave not a wreck behind.
*  We are such stuff as dreams are made on.
*  There is an experience that is common to individuals
*  all over the world in different cultures at different times
*  where they start to say they feel
*  as if they've awakened from a dream.
*  Plato did it with his cave analogy.
*  He said, imagine that we all live chained in a cave
*  and there's a fire behind us and we see shadows on the wall
*  and that's what we call reality.
*  And then someone gets out of the cave
*  and goes outside and sees this three-dimensional world
*  where everything's bright and mobile
*  and goes back and says,
*  people, the shadows on the wall are real,
*  they're real shadows,
*  but they're not the ultimate reality.
*  You should come outside and see it.
*  And Plato said everybody would say he was crazy.
*  And that's what academia says now.
*  You're crazy.
*  If you've ever had an experience
*  where you felt like there was something realer
*  than your physical self, you're crazy.
*  Like, read Plato.
*  Well, it's interesting because a few years ago,
*  so many concepts that I was intrigued by,
*  breath work, for instance, psychedelics, meditation.
*  I mean, now people get federal grants to study this stuff
*  and we do reductionist work to try and understand.
*  In fact, I had to disguise breath work
*  as respiration physiology,
*  which we did and we did a clinical trial.
*  And lo and behold, certain patterns of breathing
*  shift your internal state and your sleep and your anxiety.
*  It's like a duh.
*  Who would have thought of that?
*  It's like a giant duh,
*  but it was scary territory for a while.
*  It is, yeah.
*  And now psychedelics have kind of broken through as,
*  I mean, I just have to say this
*  while touching my forehead.
*  They adjust neuromodulators just like,
*  but differently than certain drugs
*  that adjust neuromodulators and everyone accepted.
*  So the idea of changing neuromodulators
*  to change conscious experience
*  and in that altered experience
*  to be able to achieve neuroplasticity is like,
*  it's also a big duh.
*  Of course it works that way,
*  but six years ago you'd get fired from the university
*  if you said, well, maybe psilocybin
*  could be an interesting compound for depressed people.
*  And by the way, I'm not suggesting everyone run out
*  and take a bunch of psilocybin,
*  especially if you're depressed,
*  Yeah, and not without supervision,
*  but if you can get somebody really good at it.
*  I'm not saying do it either,
*  but I'm not saying don't do it.
*  Right, and if you're more gun shy on these things,
*  contact a local university,
*  they're likely doing a clinical trial on this.
*  We can provide some links to clinical trials.
*  I think the data are incredibly interesting.
*  In any case, I guess the point is that
*  I feel like academia is kind of coming around,
*  probably due to the suffering of people in it,
*  where then they know somebody who achieved some relief
*  through meditation or some benefits of meditation.
*  So now everyone I think accepts,
*  meditation can be very useful for lowering stress
*  and altering conscious experience.
*  This is not new stuff, as everyone knows,
*  it's gone back thousands of years.
*  So it sounds like getting into the capital S self,
*  the compassionate witness is step number one.
*  And so I just wanna make sure that we make clear
*  how one does that.
*  Yeah, it's not step number one.
*  Step number one is suffering.
*  Okay.
*  We all have that.
*  You may have never felt good in your life, listener,
*  but you have suffered, that's for sure.
*  That's the first noble truth of Buddhism.
*  There is suffering in this life.
*  Pay attention to your suffering without fighting it.
*  Allow it to be there.
*  I did this meditation, if something's physically painful
*  or emotionally painful,
*  I used to say, let go, let go to myself, didn't work.
*  So one day I said, all right, you can stay, let it stay.
*  And so I do a let's stay meditation.
*  If there's pain, let it stay.
*  If there's sorrow, let it stay.
*  And as soon as I let it stay, it begins to change.
*  So first step is suffering,
*  second step is compassionate attention
*  to one's suffering with no resistance.
*  And the third step is to follow the compassion
*  that is naturally being directed toward that suffering
*  until you find yourself centered in it.
*  And that is a huge relief.
*  And I've done this in massive physical pain.
*  I've done it when I just lost people I love.
*  It's a very powerful, maybe not a panacea,
*  but not that far from it.
*  If you can get there, you're still suffering,
*  but there's a peace that holds the suffering so lovingly
*  that it no longer concerns you.
*  So on one level that you're suffering,
*  and on a different level, which feels more real to me,
*  there's only peace and compassion and wonder and joy.
*  And somebody asked me once
*  if there's a metaphysical reality, why is there suffering?
*  And I just heard coming out of my mouth
*  because the self loves experience
*  and is not afraid to suffer.
*  It's not afraid.
*  So then staying in that is highly motivated
*  by the suffering you feel when you leave.
*  So to me, that's first step, suffer.
*  Second step, pay attention to suffering.
*  Third step, follow compassion to its origin.
*  Fourth step, never stop doing that.
*  And every day.
*  Every minute.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, this is very relevant to me.
*  I have always wondered about,
*  do you push back against the feeling?
*  Do you live with the feeling?
*  Do you let it amplify?
*  There's so much contradiction
*  inside of the typical discussion of these kinds of things.
*  That's one of the reasons I love your work so much
*  is that you don't tell people what to do,
*  but you provide paths.
*  I hope so.
*  Yeah, absolutely you do.
*  Absolutely.
*  I'd like to talk about two things.
*  Before I came in here, I did a little meditation.
*  I do this before every episode,
*  but today it took only a minute
*  because it came to me so fast,
*  which is the two words that popped to mind were,
*  what's real, what is true.
*  I think so much of what we're talking about
*  in so much of life is like, what's real, what's true.
*  Certainly out in the world, but in us.
*  Yeah.
*  What I'm hearing is that at some level,
*  we need to not trust our thinking,
*  but of course there are times
*  when we need to trust our thinking.
*  And then of course we're receiving messages about
*  what's real, what's not real, what's true, what's not true.
*  Sometimes about us,
*  I mean, there's all this childhood programming.
*  How do we start to sort through this?
*  I'm guessing that it has something to do
*  with being in that compassionate witness place.
*  But let's say what you've experienced in your life,
*  I know because you've written and talked about this,
*  and I certainly have now that
*  by some interesting twist of fate,
*  I'm a public facing person,
*  people saying things about you or about me
*  that are not true.
*  Or that are judgments that don't feel good.
*  And we are not alone in this.
*  Or you don't have to be public facing
*  in order to experience this.
*  People all the time are being told they are stupid.
*  Sometimes they're being told they are brilliant
*  and they know they're not brilliant.
*  This can go in every direction.
*  How are we supposed to hold the narratives,
*  the voices that we hear in our head and outside us
*  in a way that really allows us
*  to be our best essential selves?
*  Well, can I reverse it and talk about what's true first?
*  So I remember sitting when I was 17
*  in the Lamont Library at Harvard,
*  contemplating ending my life and like-
*  Actually ending your life.
*  Yes, yes.
*  And looking at the equally miserable scratchings
*  that other teenagers had put in the wood there.
*  And I thought, okay, they say the truth will set you free.
*  All right, I'll give it a try.
*  And I just started trying to find out what was true.
*  And I read through all the works
*  of the greatest philosophers
*  until I got to Immanuel Kant who says,
*  everything is screened through our perception
*  so we can't know that anything is true for certain.
*  And I felt such relief.
*  Okay, I can't intellectually know what's true.
*  Then if it's not true,
*  if I can't intellectually know something's true
*  because everything's subjective, what's useful?
*  What feels like truth to the body?
*  And I was interested that, for example,
*  polygraph machines work because the body hates to lie.
*  It starts to send up a whole bunch of,
*  activation of stress systems
*  and puts you in fight or flight and everything
*  when you tell a lie or when you keep a secret.
*  So I just started thinking, all right,
*  what makes my body contract and weaken?
*  And what makes my body feel peaceful,
*  centered and grounded?
*  And you do so much work with the body.
*  I love that you're a brain body scientist
*  because the body is incredibly wise.
*  So I just started letting myself test things.
*  Like I was raised Mormon and very, very Mormon.
*  So, okay, Mormonism.
*  Oh boy, that doesn't make me feel good at all.
*  It wasn't for you.
*  No.
*  And okay, so God is not a white man
*  who lives near the planet Kolob.
*  Okay, that is not true.
*  That feels better, okay.
*  So I started following what made my body relax
*  because my whole body, as I said a few minutes ago,
*  is far more sophisticated,
*  has spent far more time being tinkered with by evolution
*  than my human ability to think in language.
*  So it has a response to truth or falsehood
*  that's more subtle and sophisticated
*  than my intellectual knowledge.
*  That's how I made the decision to keep my son.
*  That's how I've made almost all my decisions.
*  Does it make my body relax?
*  And then does the mind come to the party
*  and make the math work?
*  Okay, Mormonism says that all the American Indians
*  were descended from a group of Israelites
*  who came across in 600 BC in a boat to the Americas.
*  Okay, does the math work?
*  What does the genetic evidence say?
*  No, they came over the Aleutian Straits
*  and down into the Americas.
*  When I was living in Utah, they excommunicated
*  a DNA expert from the Mormon Church
*  for doing the data, for finding the data
*  that said that Mormonism's claims were wrong.
*  So something that makes my body relax
*  where it's also logically coherent, that's the first thing.
*  And then what you find is if you really pursue that,
*  what is true, what is true, what is true,
*  everything that makes you suffer
*  turns out to have flaws in the logic,
*  including I will die.
*  Because I can't know, I have no idea.
*  So to say that I will go out like a candle
*  when my body dies is just as fundamentalist
*  as saying I'm gonna go sit on a cloud and play a harp.
*  I don't know.
*  Ms. Sargadatta Maharaj, one of my favorite yogis says,
*  the only true assertion that the mind can make
*  is I do not know.
*  But you can feel what feels right to you.
*  So that's what ends up being real.
*  What's left over when you eliminate all the things
*  that feel deeply untrue to your body
*  and don't make logical sense?
*  And some of those are things that our culture
*  is very, very fond of,
*  like everything has to be measured or it's not real.
*  Is that true?
*  Right, so it sounds like challenging,
*  or sitting with doctrine and labels
*  and stories that we've heard
*  and that maybe we've internalized and just-
*  Oh, we've internalized them, yeah.
*  Yeah, and systematically exploring
*  how those make us feel in our body.
*  Yeah.
*  I'd like to take a brief break
*  and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Waking Up.
*  Waking Up is a meditation app
*  that offers hundreds of guided meditation programs,
*  mindfulness trainings, yoga nidra sessions, and more.
*  I started practicing meditation
*  when I was about 15 years old,
*  and it made a profound impact on my life.
*  And by now, there are thousands
*  of quality peer-reviewed studies
*  that emphasize how useful mindfulness meditation can be
*  for improving our focus, managing stress and anxiety,
*  improving our mood, and much more.
*  In recent years, I started using the Waking Up app
*  for my meditations because I find it
*  to be a terrific resource for allowing me
*  to really be consistent with my meditation practice.
*  Many people start a meditation practice
*  and experience some benefits,
*  but many people also have challenges
*  keeping up with that practice.
*  What I and so many other people love
*  about the Waking Up app is that it has a lot
*  of different meditations to choose from,
*  and those meditations are of different durations.
*  So it makes it very easy to keep up
*  with your meditation practice,
*  both from the perspective of novelty.
*  You never get tired of those meditations.
*  There's always something new to explore
*  and to learn about yourself
*  and about the effectiveness of meditation.
*  And you can always fit meditation into your schedule,
*  even if you only have two or three minutes per day
*  in which to meditate.
*  I also really like doing yoga nidra
*  or what is sometimes called non-sleep deep rest
*  for about 10 or 20 minutes,
*  because it is a great way to restore mental
*  and physical vigor without the tiredness
*  that some people experience when they wake up
*  from a conventional nap.
*  If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,
*  please go to wakingup.com slash Huberman,
*  where you can access a free 30-day trial.
*  Again, that's wakingup.com slash Huberman
*  to access a free 30-day trial.
*  I recall the inverse of the perfect day exercise
*  was another one that I did, which was like,
*  just call it what it was.
*  It was like the sucky day, like the shitty day, right?
*  Or just where you'd imagine something really terrible
*  and then how it would cause the body to contract.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And to recognize the other side of the coin, right?
*  And just learning that relationship
*  between the body and thought.
*  I can say from my own experience
*  that one of the biggest mistakes I ever made
*  was teaching myself to be more resilient
*  to certain forms of stress.
*  Really?
*  One of the worst mistakes I ever made.
*  Say more.
*  I mean, and my lab studies stress,
*  and I talk about stress relief and physiological size
*  are a great way to reduce real-time stress.
*  And I stand by that.
*  So I'm not talking about that.
*  I stand by meditation and saunas
*  and all the things that make us feel vacation,
*  the things that relax us.
*  So I'm not saying the ability to modulate stress
*  is incredibly powerful and useful, I believe that for sure.
*  But when I was a kid, I wasn't the kid
*  that was gonna hold the firecracker till the last second.
*  I wasn't the kid that would do the really daring thing.
*  I had friends like that.
*  And I felt kind of sheepish about that.
*  Those friends are probably dead by now.
*  They're not doing well.
*  That's true.
*  And I grew up in the then very parentless community
*  of skateboarders that, a lot of us were really wild.
*  We were very free, which I loved, the freedom part,
*  but there was a lot of mayhem and craziness,
*  especially back then.
*  And it's a beautiful culture.
*  I'm still friends with a lot of those folks,
*  but those cultures, yeah, split off basically
*  into thirds over time, about a third dead or in jail,
*  about a third doing incredibly well,
*  personally and professionally, incredibly well,
*  and a third doing well,
*  but they're not still as ambitious about that.
*  They're more focused on their personal lives,
*  and I hope that's what they wanna be doing.
*  So that's kind of how it broke down.
*  But I remember as a young kid, and then in that culture,
*  learning to push myself past the feeling
*  of like, this is dangerous, to the point where,
*  as I got older and my body eventually got stronger,
*  because back then I was always getting hurt,
*  which is why I left that sport, wasn't very good.
*  For the record, wasn't very good.
*  Good enough, but not where I wanted to be.
*  That over time, I remember when I started doing science,
*  I realized, this is crazy.
*  Skateboarding, you fall, you hurt yourself so badly,
*  you can't do it anymore.
*  That doesn't happen with studying.
*  So I'll just study until I collapse.
*  I'll just work until I'm sick.
*  I'll just, you know, like that person down the hall
*  puts in 80 hours, well, then I'll do 100,
*  and I'm not a competitive person by nature.
*  Or even worse, you know, in my mid-40s,
*  getting into like stupid stuff,
*  like cage egg-sick great white shark diving
*  to the point where I had an air failure.
*  Oh my God.
*  And it was all, you know, this whole thing.
*  And then coming back to that, I realized,
*  like, what am I doing?
*  And what had happened is I learned to override
*  the signals of the body.
*  Right.
*  And it was like, when is enough enough?
*  It's like when the reaper comes, you know?
*  And so I think that if we don't listen to the signals
*  that our body sends, and we learn to override them
*  repeatedly and systematically, we can place ourselves
*  into real psychological, emotional, and physical danger.
*  And I just, like, I don't know why,
*  I just felt like this was a need to do this
*  in order to grow up.
*  And now I try and do the exact opposite.
*  It's like, and then I feel bad, I feel kind of lazy.
*  I'm like, oh, I'm not like running at 5 a.m.
*  I'm like sleeping at 5 a.m.
*  That's so much cultural clapper.
*  I'm doing yoga nidra.
*  I'm doing yoga nidra at 7 a.m.
*  because I didn't feel I slept enough.
*  And then I have friends in the public facing, you know,
*  health space that are like, they push so hard.
*  I'm like, I'm lazy.
*  And then, so it can go too far.
*  Well, we have this culture of push, push, push,
*  produce, produce, produce.
*  One of my favorite heroes, along with Oliver Sacks,
*  is Ian McGillchrist at Oxford.
*  I love that man.
*  I may someday, he may wake up someday,
*  just to find me crouched on his bed watching him sleep.
*  He's like, he's not just a neurologist.
*  Ian, don't be scared.
*  Not in a creepy way.
*  Not in a creepy way, sir.
*  But he talks about how our particular culture
*  for the last few hundred years has veered towards stuff
*  that is preferentially favored
*  by the left hemisphere of the brain.
*  And it has to do with grasping things
*  and producing physical things
*  and getting things to happen, controlling them,
*  where the right side of the brain,
*  and of course it's all, I'm oversimplifying massively,
*  but functions like meanings, synthesis,
*  combinations of different bits of knowledge,
*  we're moving away from those.
*  And one of my good friends is Jill Bolte Taylor,
*  who had, she was a Harvard neuroanatomist,
*  and she had a massive left hemisphere stroke.
*  And so she suddenly, she watched her left hemisphere go off.
*  She had a brain bleed, and it would pulse.
*  So her left hemisphere would be there,
*  and she'd see everything as solid and measurable
*  and verbal, and then it would go off.
*  And she was in a world where she was like a fluid,
*  the size of the universe.
*  And she would watch, she was in the shower,
*  and she watched her hand on the tiles
*  dissolve into fields of energy.
*  And you were talking about energy earlier.
*  She said, by the time her left hemisphere
*  had shut down completely,
*  she managed to get a phone call made.
*  She couldn't talk by the time the phone call went through.
*  She got to a hospital, took her eight years
*  to come back to full functioning.
*  But she said, during that time,
*  I did not know people's names.
*  I didn't know the word person,
*  but boy, could I feel people's energy.
*  And as she healed, she didn't bother to get rid
*  of her ability to feel people's energy.
*  So she's a great fan of using the whole brain,
*  whole brain living, is her latest book, and it's great.
*  But Ian McGillchrist talks about
*  how when we don't use the whole brain,
*  his book, The Master and His Emissary,
*  says the part of the brain that knows meaning
*  should be the master,
*  and the data collector is just the emissary.
*  But the data collector has taken over in Western society,
*  Western educated, industrialized, rich, democratic,
*  if you want to get technical.
*  And so what you were doing to yourself
*  was completely irrational, completely.
*  You should get the Darwin Award
*  for taking yourself out of the gene pool.
*  It was like the stupidest thing.
*  I remember thinking like, what am I doing?
*  And of course, we used it to get virtual reality
*  for our lab.
*  We did a bunch of things that I thought were useful
*  that we transmuted into studies on stress.
*  So there was always a purpose in a story
*  that could justify being there.
*  Oh, there is, yeah.
*  And one that was really rooted in goodness and adventure.
*  I love adventure, and I'm super curious.
*  I think it's cool that you did that.
*  I think it's really useful.
*  I mean, there are many situations
*  where your ability to do that could be really useful.
*  Like a pair of scissors could be really useful.
*  But when you're like trying to re-diaper the baby,
*  you put the scissors down.
*  It's a tool that you can use, and it's fascinating.
*  I did martial arts for eight years,
*  and I loved pushing myself
*  to the point where I was bruised and bleeding,
*  and my doctor thought I was a victim of domestic abuse.
*  I think it's useful and even fun,
*  but you have to know when your heart's in it
*  and when your heart is not in it,
*  when yourself is delighting in the adventure
*  and when self says, no, Andrew, peace, be still.
*  Enough.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I mean, that's a perfect segue,
*  but before I move on, I wanna make sure
*  that I linked back what you said,
*  because I think it's exceptionally valuable
*  about what's real, what's true.
*  To really evaluate what's true, you need to sit,
*  or maybe one can learn to do this while in motion,
*  and sense within one's body what feels liberating,
*  opening versus what feels contracting.
*  Is that right?
*  Yeah, the Buddha used to say, he said this often,
*  that wherever you find the ocean, whatever it looks like,
*  you can know it because the ocean always tastes of salt.
*  And wherever you find awakening or enlightenment,
*  no matter what it looks like,
*  you will know it because it always tastes of freedom.
*  So it's not that you stop suffering, is that you are free.
*  You are free to interact with your own suffering
*  in a new way, and that is peace.
*  So you look, and it literally physically affects the body
*  as not free, free.
*  And if anybody out there listening,
*  go to a really rough time in your life and imagine it,
*  go to that time in your life
*  when you were pushing yourself,
*  and you can actually remember the tightness in your throat,
*  in your back, and it's contracted.
*  And then remember the best moment of your life,
*  and what was happening then,
*  and all your muscles will loosen, relax, and open.
*  And that is my gauge of truth.
*  Does it set me free?
*  The truth sets you free.
*  So whatever sets you free is the truth.
*  Then reality is gonna start changing for you
*  with or without psychedelics.
*  And I remember sitting in,
*  I had this overwhelming obsession with meditation
*  when I turned 50, and I just bought this place in the woods
*  in central California, and I'd go out
*  and sprinkle myself with bird seed
*  and meditate in the forest all day
*  while the chipmunks came and the birds would land on me.
*  Nice.
*  Oh, that was amazing.
*  And about six months into really meditating
*  for hours every day, I kind of had an experience
*  like Jill Poulty-Taylor in the shower
*  where I was in the forest with the chipmunks and birds,
*  and then it was just light, and it was like,
*  ah, it was so startling.
*  It was like it had fallen off a cliff.
*  Like I couldn't see the ground.
*  I couldn't, and then everything was back.
*  And then it started happening a lot.
*  And I read in shamanic traditions,
*  they call this experience stopping the world,
*  and it can happen through the guidance of a shaman
*  or a plant or whatever.
*  It was happening to me through meditation.
*  And in that space of light,
*  which I stopped fearing after a while,
*  it looked as if this thing we're doing now is a video game.
*  If you and I were sitting and playing a video game,
*  you would choose a character, I would choose a character,
*  you'd stab me with a sword, I'd hit you with a mace,
*  and we would say, you are hurting me, you are killing me.
*  But really we'd be talking about characters in a video game,
*  and then somebody would come say, let's go get lunch,
*  and we would put it down and go stop stabbing each other
*  and be friends.
*  It feels to me as if this is more like a game than reality,
*  the whole physical everything.
*  And I call this you, me, and you call that me,
*  and I call it you.
*  And when the game stops, however that happens,
*  there's a level of reality as different from this one
*  as a video game is from three-dimensional life.
*  There's a world outside the cave,
*  and I don't know what it is, and I may be wrong,
*  I don't care.
*  I love it.
*  I'm gonna mention Rick Rubin again, a few years back,
*  I called him up and I said, Rick,
*  you're not gonna believe this,
*  and I relayed to him a story about someone
*  that I knew really well, and this very wild set
*  of discoveries that someone else had unearthed
*  about their life being completely different
*  than it had been presented, and their business was a fail,
*  the whole thing just collapsed,
*  and Rick just wrote back, he said,
*  back to nature, the only truth.
*  Like that's very Rick, that's how he talks.
*  See, that makes my body relax.
*  Exactly, he said, well, actually, sorry,
*  it was preceded by, he said, I said, did you read this,
*  do you see this, I can't believe this,
*  and I'm like, you know this person really well,
*  and I can't, like for a very long time,
*  and he just said, it's all lies.
*  Back to nature, the only truth,
*  and I just like, and that just like,
*  like tattooed in my brain, because so much of what we see
*  and like the shock and like, I can't believe it,
*  and I think he was referring to something similar.
*  He also has said, and you're gonna get a kick out of this,
*  I think, so Rick loves professional wrestling.
*  He watches 10 hours a week of professional wrestling.
*  Why?
*  Well, first of all, he believes that it's the only thing
*  that humans have created that's real.
*  Why?
*  Because everyone agrees that it's not real.
*  It's fake.
*  It's fake, and that he likes that no one gets hurt.
*  I mean, people actually can get hurt,
*  but that no one's trying to actually hurt the other person.
*  They're collaborating in this kind of Shakespearean dance
*  that they do, and you have the different characters,
*  and so I went to see professional wrestling with Rick,
*  thinking like, what am I doing here?
*  Like it was like loud and the flames and all this,
*  like not a scene I would normally take myself to
*  on a Friday, and it was so much fun,
*  but mostly because of how delighted Rick was,
*  and seeing it, and his son as well.
*  So we can distinguish or like really identify what's true
*  through this practice.
*  As close as we can.
*  We can't ever know completely what's true.
*  The whole, the Baconian method is accept nothing
*  until it's proven true.
*  Well, we can't prove anything true.
*  We could all be dreaming this.
*  So I decided that I would accept everything
*  until I'm convinced that it's false.
*  So I don't really believe anything,
*  but I'm willing to.
*  Like a scientist.
*  Yeah, I don't believe anything because I can't,
*  nothing can be absolutely proven,
*  but I do know what's most useful to me,
*  what makes me healthy.
*  I've had a really, really sick, weak body most of my life,
*  and it became a big part of my navigational system.
*  I now think I have the MCAS,
*  Mass Cell Activation Syndrome.
*  You put out a podcast on that.
*  My daughter's been diagnosed with it.
*  I probably have it.
*  And it's just this weird random thing
*  where you get symptoms in different parts of your body.
*  It's overactive immune system.
*  Yeah.
*  It'll protect you from cancer.
*  Does it really?
*  Well, it turns out that people that run kind of
*  more towards autoimmune conditions,
*  like people who have skin conditions
*  that are autoimmune based have fewer skin cancers
*  because the immune system is combating all these invaders.
*  It combats everything.
*  So there's a, yeah, if there's an upside,
*  and this is the basis of a lot of the logic
*  related to immunotherapies for cancers,
*  is trying to have the immune system fight off
*  these mutations that are always occurring in the background.
*  Wow. Super cool.
*  I'm not trying to take away from the suffering it's created,
*  but that's an upside.
*  And my mother had it,
*  and I just wish she had lived to see the diagnosis even exist.
*  But my daughter called me from England the other day,
*  and we were talking about the fact
*  that she has that diagnosis.
*  And she said,
*  I am allergic to my own goddamn emotions.
*  And I was like, yeah, we both are.
*  And my whole journey has been really, really accelerated
*  by the fact that if I go off true for myself emotionally,
*  psychologically, metaphysically, whatever,
*  I immediately get physical symptoms of some kind.
*  But when I am true to myself, they all subside,
*  and I get this unbelievable health.
*  So I've been told that I had five different progressive
*  incurable diseases.
*  I don't have any symptoms.
*  But if I allow myself to be untrue to myself,
*  if I allow myself to get out of integrity,
*  I suffer intensely and immediately in a very real way.
*  So I don't know what's true,
*  but I know what keeps me healthy,
*  and I know what feels like freedom.
*  And if I hit a thought like,
*  there is nothing to us but physical matter,
*  and it feels like tension,
*  like when I put down my dog,
*  and I felt something go through me,
*  whoo, as she died.
*  It was like, I don't know whether that I was feeling
*  something that was real,
*  but that's as close to the truth as I can get.
*  And if I, see right now, what's happening to me,
*  I'm getting into this self thing.
*  And as I'm talking about this dog, I feel that dog.
*  And I can feel, I'm gonna sound crazy.
*  No, not if you're talking about dogs and feeling.
*  I know, right?
*  You might make me cry,
*  because I'm thinking about,
*  no, because I think I can sense it.
*  I think I can sense it.
*  And forgive me if I'm like,
*  now sounding like totally crazy.
*  If anyone's listening, like this, I will say,
*  and I have a, I'm just gonna be blunt.
*  I got a lot of training in neuroscience.
*  I got decades of training in it.
*  And I'll tell you, the notion of energy
*  is not mysterious at all.
*  I mean, neurons are electricity and chemical exchange,
*  and that happens locally, and it happens at a distance.
*  Yeah, our phones are electronic circuits
*  that communicate at a distance.
*  We are electronic circuits.
*  Why shouldn't we communicate at a distance?
*  And the really forward-thinking neuroscientists
*  are starting to put multiple people into scanners
*  and putting people in scanners in different locations.
*  And I know it sounds like people are like,
*  oh no, like, what are you talking about?
*  This is like spoon bending stuff.
*  No, the idea that thought and emotion at one location
*  can impact thought and location at another one
*  is that magnetoreception has been published
*  in the journal Science.
*  So we're not outside the bounds of reality.
*  We are like actually finally as a field
*  starting to acknowledge that this stuff exists
*  and starting to poke and prod around in there.
*  But people have known about this.
*  So for you, the sensing of your dog passing
*  or you can feel them present?
*  My dog was a physical entity,
*  but my dog was also an energetic entity.
*  And that entity was something I could feel.
*  And this is, I don't know how many,
*  a couple of years later, I start talking about that dog.
*  I feel it again.
*  And it is a, I have, okay.
*  So when I was pregnant with my son, Adam,
*  but one of the big reasons I chose to keep the baby
*  is that from the moment he was conceived,
*  I started having experiences that completely
*  blew apart my understanding of reality.
*  My husband at the time was traveling in Asia a lot.
*  And when I would think about him,
*  it happened a lot at night for me,
*  I'd be like lying in bed and I would think about him
*  and it would be daytime in Asia.
*  And I would suddenly be like in a three dimensional movie
*  where I'd be walking down a street in Japan
*  or flying over a thunderstorm in an airplane.
*  And I'd see these very specific things, very specific.
*  And then he would call me like the next day and say,
*  oh, I was walking down this street in Japan
*  and I saw this very specific banner
*  and I flew over a thunderstorm
*  and the lightning was amazing.
*  And I started to realize I was picking up information
*  that he was seeing and it was testable, it kept happening.
*  So what is that?
*  It would have been so non-scientific of me
*  to say that is completely insignificant,
*  don't pay any attention.
*  It just was too weird.
*  And so that's when I decided I'll believe anything
*  until I'm convinced it's false.
*  And that throws your whole mind open
*  to understanding the universe as being far more mysterious
*  than our culture likes to say it is.
*  And yes, there's a danger of getting woo-woo and crazy,
*  but as I said, the math has to work too.
*  And you're just telling us how the neurophysics of energy
*  are being tested and shown to be operative.
*  It's not woo-woo, it's just at the outside edge
*  of what our culture is willing to accept.
*  Yeah, and the instruments we have to measure things
*  are just not there yet.
*  But the same was said about most everything
*  that has been clearly discovered and is rock solid
*  over the last 50 plus years, at least in neuroscience.
*  I can't help but just briefly share
*  when I put Costello down, because I did that myself,
*  which sucked.
*  Oh!
*  Yeah, but I didn't want to, I mean, so the vets,
*  they came to the house, but it was at home
*  and I was right there.
*  I didn't do the injection.
*  Okay, good.
*  No, no, no, originally I thought I would,
*  because unfortunately, because of my previous job,
*  I had to do that a number of times.
*  That's, ooh.
*  Yeah.
*  That is not an accident.
*  No, so, but what was interesting is, you know,
*  like he let out a big like, ugh, sigh
*  right there at the end, but the wildest part of it was,
*  and I swear it sounds like I'm making this up,
*  but at the moment he went, I felt my heart heat up.
*  I thought I was gonna be crushed like a broken heart.
*  And I swear it felt as if he was giving me
*  all this energy back.
*  Wow.
*  And it's because I had been spending so much time,
*  he was up in the middle of the night a lot.
*  He must've had some dementia or that kind of thing.
*  And I mean, I had that dog on everything.
*  I was injecting him with testosterone for the last part.
*  Made him a lot healthier, folks.
*  Don't let your dog breed, you know, indiscriminately,
*  but like I've got my theories about, you know,
*  all this stuff that hormones and animals that a lot of the
*  vets are aligned with me on this one.
*  Talk to your vet, talk to a progressive vet.
*  You know, I had him on a bunch of different drugs.
*  I had him, you know, he was really unhappy.
*  So letting it, it was the right thing to do.
*  And I'll stop talking about it
*  because I'll get too worked up.
*  But forgive me.
*  But that feeling, it was like, whoa.
*  And I can still feel it.
*  It's like he gave something back that now,
*  I think enough times pass, I go get another dog.
*  It was almost like, oh, here's all this resource
*  and like gratitude.
*  And so these things sound kind of woo, right?
*  Could you do an experiment where you put me in the lab
*  while I go through that?
*  Sure.
*  Would you see huge physiological change?
*  Sure.
*  I don't see the point of that kind of experiment
*  because I think enough people have experienced
*  these kinds of things that it's not necessary.
*  In any case, I want to talk about integrity
*  and your book, Way of Integrity.
*  You ran a very interesting experiment
*  that frankly, it's going to sound a little scary
*  to some people and maybe-
*  They don't have to do it.
*  And maybe reflexive to other people,
*  which is, I think it was one year of no lying.
*  Yes.
*  But like no lying of any kind, not even to yourself.
*  No, especially not to myself.
*  And previously on the podcast,
*  we had my colleague, Dr. Anna Lemke,
*  who runs our dual diagnosis addiction clinic.
*  She's done a tremendous service to the world
*  talking about all the various kinds of addiction,
*  addiction as a disease, yes,
*  but also something that people can overcome.
*  And one of the things that I love so much
*  about Anna's message, she wrote the book, Dopamine Nation.
*  Oh, I love that book.
*  Yeah, wonderful book.
*  Is she talks about how recovered addicts
*  are actually her heroes
*  because they've learned to navigate this internal process
*  that most people perhaps who aren't addicts
*  or don't think they are,
*  are constantly being yanked around by these dopamine systems,
*  but they've learned to conquer their own dopamine system.
*  Right.
*  So they represent the heroes of her world.
*  And I love that model because we tend to look at addicts
*  and think about it as like,
*  like there's all this judgment on it.
*  But- No, I think it's amazing.
*  I think addicts are people who are hypersensitive
*  to the suffering that they are told to accept.
*  And so they're trying to medicate the suffering
*  that comes from being out of integrity.
*  And the society says, you know,
*  like I talked to people, I interviewed people for this book
*  who would go to their,
*  this one woman went with her husband to the psychiatrist
*  and they said, you know,
*  she's not happy doing the traditional wife role.
*  And they sat there and talked about what medication
*  would enable her to fulfill this social role
*  that she just didn't like.
*  And it never occurred to anybody to say, you know,
*  maybe don't do it if you don't like it that much.
*  And people are medicating themselves into a conformity
*  with social systems that are not in line
*  with their true nature.
*  And addicts hurt and they sometimes they find a substance
*  or they find an activity that gives them relief.
*  And so they use it because they're in a lot of pain.
*  And one-
*  Until it becomes the source of pain.
*  Yeah. And it always does.
*  And it's horrible.
*  But one addiction specialist I know says,
*  it's like they're standing on a nail
*  and trying to take enough drugs to stop the pain.
*  And that is not what you need to do
*  when you're standing on a nail,
*  you need to take the nail out.
*  And the nail is the part of your life
*  that you're living that's out of integrity
*  with your true nature
*  because other people want you to live that way.
*  And they will force themselves.
*  They want to stay in the position of pain or fear,
*  push past it, be stronger.
*  Yeah, I've spent a lot of my life there, I'll confess.
*  And it's super unpleasant.
*  And it's always led to like shitty things.
*  But how laudable is it that you took
*  what the culture told you was good
*  and by God you learned to do it.
*  And we tell ourselves stories like,
*  well, if we achieve certain things,
*  then we'll be in a better position
*  to do more for other people.
*  Like there's the martyrdom version of it too.
*  The reason I brought up Anna was she was the first
*  to alert me to these studies that have been done
*  about how myelination and growth
*  of the prefrontal cortex is actually accelerated
*  when people tell the truth,
*  especially around truths that are somewhat uncomfortable.
*  And it's a beautiful literature that's small,
*  but starting to really emerge.
*  Yeah.
*  And the big part of the recovery from addiction
*  is people first like acknowledging the truth to themselves
*  and then to other people.
*  And again, all of that's kind of shrouded
*  by how we think about addicts.
*  Like sadly in any major city and even small towns now,
*  you can see that the bent over, you know,
*  like fentanyl addicts and like we judge,
*  we're like, oh, you know, or we say it's so sad or,
*  but that's just, you know, an example of how far gone
*  people can get in that particular addiction.
*  Anna offers an interesting idea,
*  which is that the more we tell these little micro truths,
*  the more connected to reality we are.
*  Yes.
*  In the way of integrity,
*  you talk about this experiment that you did.
*  My first integrity cleanse.
*  So an integrity cleanse.
*  So maybe you could explain what it is.
*  And it sounds incredibly scary.
*  It's not just the telling the truth part,
*  it's the realizing the truth part.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I guess I'm gonna start with the woo story.
*  I was very sick and at one point they rushed me into surgery,
*  didn't know what was wrong with me.
*  I had some internal bleeding going on.
*  That's a long story, wrote about it in another book.
*  Point is during the surgery,
*  I regained consciousness and sat up
*  and looked at them operating on me, which was surprising
*  because I was lying down there.
*  And so I was like very disconcerted and I lay back down
*  and I looked up between the surgical lights
*  and between them appeared this ball of light
*  that was much, much, much brighter than the surgical lights,
*  which are very bright.
*  And it was so beautiful.
*  You can't describe it, it's outside the cave.
*  And I was just completely obsessed by it.
*  And then it started to grow.
*  And when it touched me and it filled things,
*  it didn't bounce off things, it filled them.
*  When it touched me, this incredible joy and love
*  and warmth flooded my body.
*  And I started to cry and my body was crying.
*  And the surgeons noticed these tears coming out of my eyes.
*  And they freaked out because they thought
*  that I was feeling the surgery
*  and crying was the only thing I could do about it.
*  So they were panicking and the anesthesiologist,
*  they told him, bump up the medication.
*  Later, because I grilled him later,
*  what did you give me, what are the side effects,
*  what happens, can I have some more?
*  He said afterward that when he went to increase the medication,
*  he said a voice said to him, don't,
*  she's crying because she's happy.
*  And he said, I just did what it said.
*  And he was white and shaking.
*  And he said, did I do the right thing?
*  So I kind of told him a little of the story.
*  Anyway, this light was there.
*  Wild.
*  Yeah.
*  And I was just like home, home, home.
*  And it said, yeah, okay, so this is what you really are.
*  And you're about to have a pretty tough time for a while.
*  But just remember, I'm always here,
*  even though you can't see me.
*  And so I came out of that surgery and I thought,
*  I will not allow anything to my life
*  that doesn't feel like that light.
*  Oh, that's what it, it wasn't like it used language,
*  but it said, this is not the way you feel after you die.
*  This is the way you're supposed to learn
*  to feel all the time.
*  So in your body, out of your body, doesn't matter.
*  This is how you're meant to feel.
*  And believe me, when I worked with heroin addicts,
*  they would describe their first high.
*  And it was as close to that as anything
*  I'd heard people describe.
*  And I would say, I believe you're meant to feel that way
*  and also keep your teeth.
*  So I didn't tell a lie for a year.
*  I came out of it and I thought, well, lying is definitely
*  not gonna feel like that.
*  That white does not lie.
*  So no lies ever.
*  Of any kind, even though micro like,
*  like when are you gonna be home and you know it's 12 minutes
*  and you say 10.
*  Can't say that, say 12.
*  Do you like my outfit?
*  No, I do not.
*  I mean, I found ways to,
*  I would sort of try to soften the truth.
*  Did it mean also telling every truth that was in your head
*  or you would keep certain things to yourself?
*  No, in fact, it felt untrue to say certain things
*  to certain people.
*  It felt invasive or offensive and that didn't feel true.
*  Sometimes silence was the greatest truth I could tell,
*  but I didn't even know that that was the case
*  until I started my experiment.
*  So I did not lie for that year
*  and I've done it many, many times since,
*  but I would not recommend jumping into it 100%
*  from a life that hasn't already been pretty examined.
*  What Anna has said, and I think in the backdrop
*  of what you're saying is that everybody
*  does these little micro adjustments or,
*  and you've said constantly,
*  and you've said that this is largely
*  to smooth social interactions,
*  that most of lying is to smooth social interactions.
*  Yeah, the research shows that most people lie
*  at least three times within 10 minutes
*  of meeting another person, they lie to them.
*  And men are socially conditioned to tell lies
*  that make them seem a little bit cooler
*  than they maybe think they are for real.
*  And women, people identified as women,
*  are socialized to tell lies
*  that make other people feel good about themselves.
*  So it takes you in different directions,
*  but I just wasn't gonna tell any lie at all.
*  And let me just say that that year,
*  it's not like I could say I lost these things,
*  but the fact is I dropped them, I walked away from them.
*  My religion, with the religion went the family of origin,
*  every friend I had growing up,
*  because to leave Mormonism is worse than murder
*  in that community.
*  I was cast into outer darkness.
*  My marriage realized I was gay, oops.
*  I hadn't figured that out at 29.
*  That came to you as a realization in that year.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay, it must've been in your unconscious someplace prior.
*  Yeah, smart enough.
*  There'd never been a kind of like knock, knock, hey.
*  No, I was so bent on being a good person
*  according to my socialization,
*  the same way you were bent on being a brave, strong male
*  according to the skateboarding culture.
*  I would never have let that anywhere near my consciousness.
*  And it had to be a series of experiences.
*  And my ex-husband was gay as well.
*  So I'd known that about him for a while.
*  And so, and I knew he was his best self
*  when he was his gay self.
*  So that kind of helped,
*  but the marriage ended because of that.
*  Let's see what else happened.
*  Oh, yeah, I quit academia.
*  So my industry,
*  the thing I'd gone to all those years of school for,
*  my job, means of support,
*  left my, I was living in Utah at the time
*  and I sort of fled for the border.
*  So I lost my home.
*  How were you feeling during this time?
*  Better and better and better.
*  Sorry, I just wanna laugh.
*  I expected you to be like, it was horrible.
*  You're like, no, better and better.
*  It kind of was, but not as horrible
*  as staying in all those things.
*  And the part that intrigues me at the moment
*  is like the losing of friends,
*  like losing of people and the structures
*  that we relied on also for safety.
*  Yeah.
*  That's gotta be hard.
*  Oh, it's very, yeah, for parts of the psyche
*  that are very attached to socialization
*  and attached to people that are familiar to you,
*  it's heartbreaking, really heartbreaking.
*  But that light gave me a full on experience of the self.
*  And I just, what it told me was it's always there.
*  My son who has Down syndrome one day told me
*  after his friend's mother died,
*  we're coming home from the funeral.
*  And he said, I didn't cry.
*  And I said, it's okay if you cried, strong men cry.
*  And this is a sad time.
*  And he said, it's not as hard after the light comes in
*  and opens your heart.
*  And he can barely talk.
*  And so it was very garbled.
*  And I was like, what, a light came and opened your heart?
*  He said, mm-hmm.
*  I said, well, when did this happen?
*  He said, May 10th.
*  I was like, this year?
*  No, I was 13.
*  And I was like, you're holding out on me.
*  So this light had appeared in his room
*  when he was having a really hard time.
*  Kids with Down syndrome don't have easy lives.
*  And it touched his heart.
*  And he said, since then, nothing was as hard.
*  And I said, you know, I saw it too.
*  And it said to me that it's always with us
*  even though we can't see it.
*  And he said, oh, I can see it.
*  And I was like, you can?
*  And he was like, yeah.
*  Like, he was sort of disappointed in me.
*  And I said, well, where is it?
*  Is it like up there, down here, in your head, in your heart?
*  And he just looked at me and he said, mom, it's everywhere.
*  He just sees the whole world illuminated.
*  And I think that's what I saw in the forest
*  when suddenly the world would just turn to light.
*  It was that light.
*  So that was the field.
*  And as I lost each friendship, as I lost each job,
*  as I faced the fear and the heartbreak and everything,
*  those parts of me were dissolving.
*  And I was becoming more identified with that light.
*  And that was the thing.
*  It was completely selfish.
*  I was not going back to the way I felt
*  before I felt that light.
*  Never going back there.
*  Did you feel as if you had to accomplish
*  certain things, degrees, et cetera, first
*  in order to allow yourself this?
*  Because I hear this a lot.
*  And in the backdrop of this entire conversation,
*  I have one little piece of neural real estate,
*  which is devoted to the audience that is saying,
*  okay, I can do these things once I have a job,
*  once I have blank, once I have the resources.
*  But at the same time, I do want to highlight for people
*  that everything that we've talked about
*  in terms of practices and things to do,
*  you just do them.
*  There's no purchase.
*  It's inside of us.
*  There's no looking to something in a package
*  or in even a program.
*  It's all within us.
*  So it can be done really anywhere
*  and with any amount of resources or lack thereof.
*  But be gentle with yourself.
*  Don't quit your job.
*  I was very violent.
*  I was quite a lot like you.
*  The way I got in Harvard was I had a part of myself
*  called Fang that did not care what hurt me.
*  I'd go running in the snow.
*  I remember once I bought running shoes that were too small
*  and all my toenails came off during that run
*  and I just kept running.
*  And I'd stop and take off another toenail and keep running.
*  I was able to be very brutal to myself.
*  Just living in Boston is brutal to me.
*  Well, you know, on the plus side,
*  my feet were completely numb because of the cold.
*  Right, okay, there's that.
*  So you have the capacity for extreme resilience.
*  Yeah.
*  And it perhaps took you too far.
*  Yeah, and I think that's why I did
*  this massive integrity cleanse when I was at a place
*  where I was far, far away from my true self.
*  And because of that, it was a kind of violent
*  breaking of connections.
*  So now if I'm coaching somebody, I'm like, be very gentle.
*  Take the, I call it one degree turns.
*  If you're flying a plane and you turn one degree north
*  every half hour, you won't even notice it's turning
*  but you'll end up someplace very different.
*  So just gently move away from what causes you to suffer.
*  Get yourself the hot cup of tea in the morning
*  to soothe your throat.
*  Listen to your own sorrow.
*  Cancel a meeting because you just don't feel like doing it.
*  You know, these are the things that bring you back
*  to your truth.
*  And it's always loving.
*  And it's not loving necessarily to just say,
*  I'm gonna say the truth about everything
*  and I don't care who hates me for it.
*  That was just my way.
*  And inevitably a much kinder, more generous version
*  of ourselves emerges when we're living our truth.
*  I mean, it's a foregone conclusion
*  but still worth stating.
*  Yeah, I can personally say that most of my suffering
*  has been the consequence of the fact that I am,
*  I love love and I'm blessed with many great friends
*  and things of that sort, business partners, et cetera.
*  But I have a tendency to get into relationships quickly
*  and ending them feels near impossible.
*  And this has caused me and also others too much suffering.
*  And so a lot of that is, the reason I raised this
*  is that it's about holding two truths at the same time
*  which are feel incompatible.
*  On the one hand, really loving and caring
*  about someone and at the same time,
*  knowing that the loving caring thing to do
*  is to go separate ways.
*  And it's this relationship to loss
*  that I sort of can't accept or haven't been able to.
*  Like I can accept that people die.
*  All three of my academic advisors, wonderful people,
*  suicide, cancer, cancer.
*  So I had to come to the conclusion pretty early on
*  in my academic career, like, wow,
*  I'm the common denominator.
*  I joke, you know, like, and it took me a long time
*  to realize like this might not be my fault.
*  You know, I know it's crazy.
*  Like how would that, you know,
*  but I think that it also woke me up to the idea,
*  you know, like life as we know it in this life ends.
*  And so to try and make the most of it.
*  But the idea that people would move apart,
*  even in circumstances where death doesn't separate them,
*  to me is like, it's so painful.
*  Yeah.
*  Was it Keats who said that of all the ways there are
*  to lose a person, death is the kindest.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And this has roots in all sorts of things.
*  And me, of course, but the reason I raise it is that
*  I think that when we have two incompatible truths,
*  that's when we feel stuck.
*  Like we love people, we wanna take care of them.
*  Maybe we want them to remain in our lives,
*  but we have to, like the letting go process sucks.
*  There can't be incompatible truths.
*  I think what happens is that you,
*  and just tell me where I'm wrong, okay?
*  I could be completely full of crap.
*  It sounds to me like you're one of the people
*  who have a huge heart,
*  who sometimes confuse love with self abandonment,
*  who love so deeply that you want the joy of the beloved
*  more than you want your own joy.
*  100%.
*  And that is not love.
*  That is a hostage situation, okay?
*  Like there's something I call spider love.
*  If you say to a spider, how do you feel about flies?
*  It would say, oh, I love them.
*  And it expresses that love by immobilizing them,
*  wrapping them up and injecting them with poison
*  and then sucking out their life force
*  whenever it needs them.
*  And it loves those flies, yum.
*  But love always sets the beloved free, okay?
*  So there's a consumptive love.
*  And when you are a fly and you meet a spider
*  and you give your whole self to this person,
*  who goes yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, I really want that,
*  you find yourself starved of your own validation,
*  your kindness to your true self,
*  and you've given it all to the other person.
*  And that's when it will not work.
*  And you may be missing the people
*  who aren't looking for flies or who want to just,
*  I'm not gonna extend this metaphor any further,
*  who just wanna be with you as a whole human,
*  who want to know what your limitations are
*  as well as their own, who will say to you,
*  I have a new friend who I had pneumonia
*  and I wanted to talk to her on the phone.
*  And I told my assistant, I don't care if I have pneumonia.
*  And she wrote me a text and she said,
*  do not impinge on your own health
*  because you want me to feel loved.
*  I don't like it.
*  I want you to be healthy.
*  And I was like, well, whoo.
*  So I would examine the moment where
*  you become so entranced with another
*  that you stop caring about yourself
*  and try to feed your whole life to them
*  because that's not love.
*  It's something our culture defines as love.
*  A lot of parents love their children that way.
*  But you have to be able to know exactly what you want
*  to communicate to the other person
*  and to have them say, I completely respect that.
*  Or you don't have a love situation, you have codependency.
*  That's very useful.
*  Thank you.
*  And I know it will be very useful to many people.
*  What is the suggestion for people
*  that are trying to figure out what they want or need?
*  Or both?
*  I'll relate it to this relationship thing
*  because it applies across everything
*  but it's hardest in relationships.
*  And that is start to notice the first moment
*  when part of you, a deep part of you,
*  knew you were losing your threat,
*  you were losing your integrity.
*  So if you think about a relationship you had
*  that ended poorly, where you loved the other person
*  by giving your whole self to them,
*  which you've been taught is called love,
*  even though I don't think it is called love.
*  So, and then look back on the first moment
*  that she wanted something
*  and you abandoned yourself to give it to her.
*  And it's usually very early in the relationship.
*  Like day one.
*  Yeah, it's like, this isn't safe.
*  Exactly.
*  And you just crushed right over that boundary
*  that very sensitive inner vigilance that's saying,
*  this is how we stay whole.
*  And or this is how we stay in integrity.
*  So most people with a job, with a relationship,
*  with any choice they make, they can trace it back.
*  When I pick up the pieces for them years later,
*  they're like, oh, I knew that the first week
*  and I stayed in there for 20 years.
*  So it's about, as I said earlier,
*  being really granular in your experience
*  of your own suffering and knowing
*  that you are not here to suffer.
*  There's this big thing that men in our society are taught
*  that if, you know, there are love songs,
*  like I would, I can't remember his name.
*  He won the Nobel Prize for Literature.
*  And you know, I would crawl down the avenue black and blue
*  to show my love, to make you feel my love.
*  And it's like, okay, that's not showing me love.
*  You don't have to hurt yourself to show me love.
*  But maybe that's why you have to pull back six inches
*  from your own eyes to brutalize yourself for other people
*  that martyr archetype.
*  It's no, it doesn't work.
*  Yeah, it's caused me and I think others a lot of suffering
*  because I think what ends up happening is that
*  when we get separation from that person,
*  then we do a little bit of self-recovery,
*  but then it's like all fractured.
*  And repeat, yeah.
*  And repeat, right, exactly.
*  What you just described is extremely helpful.
*  I'm curious in your role as a coach to many people,
*  how often are romantic relationships,
*  partnership type things, whatever form that takes for people,
*  how often is that like the bulk of what people struggle with,
*  at least in terms of what they bring to the table?
*  Or is it more often, I don't like my job,
*  I'm in the wrong life professionally?
*  If you had to give us like the non peer reviewed study,
*  but like kind of crude breakdown.
*  Yeah, I think because they identify me as a coach,
*  they go to a therapist with relationship things,
*  but people come to me with my life's just not working,
*  that feeling you were just going.
*  Like the whole thing, oh great, nice.
*  So they give you the whole thing.
*  Yeah, the whole thing's not working,
*  but in my job, I need to change my job,
*  I need to get my purpose, I need to have my life's meaning.
*  And it always ends up ending up
*  to be about the relationship as well.
*  Anybody, anything we do that's dysfunctional
*  for any part of ourselves is dysfunctional
*  for every part of ourselves.
*  The way we do anything is the way we do everything.
*  So if you come in with a job issue,
*  because you've got a horrible boss,
*  but you never complain,
*  you're gonna end up telling me
*  that you're in a horrible marriage
*  with a spouse who's awful, but you never complain.
*  That same issues come forward as a kind of gift
*  to show us over and over, not that way.
*  No, okay, see that pattern?
*  No, see that pattern?
*  No.
*  Well, it's interesting that you say that,
*  because I feel like professionally,
*  it's like there's like a gravitational pull.
*  Like I wanted to get into tropical fish when I was a kid,
*  and I was like tropical fish,
*  I would spend all day at the tropical fish store,
*  then it was birds, then it was skateboarding,
*  then it was, I would want to be a firefighter,
*  eventually it was neuroscience, then it was podcasting,
*  it's just like, I can't miss.
*  When I say that, I mean, I can't keep myself
*  from doing what I really want.
*  I would say likewise with friendships,
*  I'm fortunate to have a great relationship
*  to my biological family.
*  It was rock, really rocky for a lot of years,
*  but it's like the work has paid off,
*  and they've done a lot of work.
*  In romantic partnership, it's like a carve out,
*  it's been much more challenging.
*  I've had some amazing partners and partnerships,
*  like amazing, still on excellent terms with many of them.
*  And then I've had some like really, really brutal,
*  like barbed wire, just like, and you know,
*  I've had to take a look at my role in that too, right?
*  So in this case for me, it's like a carve out,
*  I think of it as like this, like wedge shaped carve out.
*  That just seems so much more challenging,
*  but I think in talking with you today,
*  it's clear that it's because of this thing of like,
*  it's not, I'm not approaching it from the standpoint of like,
*  I want to do this and it's good for me, to be frank.
*  Whereas in the work domain, it's like what feels good
*  ends up being really good for me.
*  Because for a while you did things that hurt you,
*  and then you realized, no, the things that hurt me,
*  I'm not gonna do that, I'm gonna do the things I like.
*  When you bring another human being into it,
*  when it's a romantic partnership,
*  I think you still have the pattern
*  of I will do things that hurt me.
*  I will abandon my sense of safety.
*  I will go over my own experienced internal boundary.
*  And you just haven't, you've done it
*  in other areas of your life, but this is, yeah,
*  this is a big one for you,
*  where you just haven't applied the same wisdom
*  you've learned in other areas.
*  And I would guess that it's because you don't feel
*  that that's loving to the other person.
*  If you decide you're not gonna kill animals at your job,
*  the people at your lab aren't gonna be heartbroken.
*  But if you decide you don't want to live
*  a certain kind of life with another person,
*  that person's heart could get broken.
*  Or at least they could feel that way,
*  they could genuinely feel pain.
*  So I think maybe that's why it's a cutout thing,
*  because changing your job doesn't hurt someone,
*  but changing your relationship pattern,
*  somebody could get hurt.
*  And if you don't change your pattern,
*  someone will also get hurt.
*  Right, well, and that's often the case, right?
*  And I think, so this notion of others getting hurt
*  when we make the choice that's most in line
*  with our own integrity, whether it's relationship
*  or family or the decision to move or leave a job,
*  how do you sit with that?
*  I mean, how does one sit with that?
*  I mean, I think I have clearly internalized some script
*  that says if someone else is really upset,
*  even, and obviously the right thing is often not the thing
*  that makes people feel best, et cetera, et cetera,
*  but how do you work with that?
*  So there are different ways of reframing it.
*  And one example, since you know a lot about addiction,
*  if somebody is addicted to you pleasing them,
*  you're pleasing them and going out of your integrity
*  to please them, to give them whatever they want
*  that pleases them, your addiction as a codependent
*  is giving them that emotional energy,
*  whatever gets them high.
*  And their absorption of that energy
*  and the imbalance that results,
*  it's as if they are getting high on you.
*  And an alcoholic, if you take away the bottle of booze,
*  will tell you, you are hurting me.
*  This is the worst thing you could ever do to me.
*  You have no idea how much I'm suffering.
*  And the thing you have to do in an intervention is,
*  no, it's the alcohol that's doing the hurting.
*  It's the overgiving, it's allowing someone
*  to consume your energy and to get high on it.
*  That is an addiction, I will not let you do it.
*  I will separate from you person to person
*  if you continue in your addictive pattern.
*  Doesn't mean that we won't be together in the great self
*  and that we're all one self
*  and we can all love each other forever.
*  But it is not kind to feed someone's addiction
*  to eating your energy.
*  Does that make sense?
*  Yes.
*  It's not, you have to do some tough love.
*  Yeah, the compassionate thing is to do the right thing.
*  Yeah, this is not helping you.
*  And they say, but I want more of you.
*  And you say, no, no, you really don't.
*  You want something false I was creating for you
*  and it's actually not me.
*  My friends who, why would you leave the church?
*  Now you're lost to us.
*  And I was like, no, I was always a gay non-Mormon.
*  I was just feeding you the story
*  that I was a straight Mormon girl.
*  And I can't feed you that anymore.
*  It's making you sick, it's making me sick, it's not true.
*  And some of them I never saw again.
*  And some of them came around years later and said,
*  oh, I figured it out.
*  And some probably still are really happy
*  and think I'm going to hell.
*  Sorry, I didn't laugh at that, but I did.
*  I don't know.
*  I find it hilarious.
*  I mean, sorry, not sorry.
*  No, that was, I just, nothing to do but laugh there.
*  Goodness.
*  Yeah, I think this notion of things ending
*  because we realized that we were telling lies.
*  Yeah.
*  And gosh, it even hurts to say,
*  it's like, because we weren't trying to tell lies.
*  No, no.
*  We didn't know we were telling lies.
*  Yeah, it's an innocent mistake.
*  To me, that often grows from what I think of as empathy,
*  probably not, certainly not the best form of empathy.
*  But I think that there's a human phenotype
*  that I'm familiar with where we feel other people's emotions,
*  which I think is healthy, can be healthy.
*  And we love seeing people enjoy.
*  And we delight in it.
*  So it feels good to us to feed this addiction.
*  Oh, I know the feeling.
*  It's not like, it's like, oh, here I am, Marta.
*  I'm like, I'm bleeding out, bleeding out, bleeding out.
*  But it's not in line with this essential self.
*  And here, I guess the little vignette
*  that's related to this is that I do think
*  there's one very healthy form of this,
*  which is, I believe, at least for me,
*  with a dog, I like other animals too, but with a dog,
*  when we love them, we are seamlessly attached
*  to their love of us.
*  And so loving them and empathizing with them
*  means like double the love.
*  Like we love them and we can feel their love.
*  And it's like a perfect, it just feels like a perfect circle.
*  And with people, that can happen too, I imagine.
*  I felt that a few times.
*  I certainly feel that in my friendships.
*  I feel that with my sister.
*  And I've felt it in a few of my romantic relationships.
*  But the empathy for the other's pleasure can go too far.
*  And then when we quote unquote lose ourselves,
*  I think it's because there's a component of ourselves
*  that's like not attached to the part
*  that still has our own needs to resonate.
*  Oh, totally, yeah.
*  Here's the thing, you don't expect your dog
*  to pretend it's not a dog.
*  You don't deserve, you don't expect your dog
*  to stop loving walks and chasing a ball
*  and just being a dog.
*  And when it's tired, it'll go to sleep.
*  But often when we fall in love,
*  we try to make ourselves not who we are
*  and try to become the person that will make the other
*  maximally thrilled with us.
*  And I know exactly what you're talking about.
*  I have thrown, like I love to give money to people.
*  Yeah, I do too.
*  It makes them happy.
*  And then it never works.
*  Well, it works out only in cases
*  where it feels true in my heart.
*  If I over give because someone's there saying I need
*  and it doesn't feel good in the giving,
*  I am not being a dog.
*  A dog would say, no, this is where my limits are.
*  I'm gonna go lie down on the floor and sleep.
*  But I will get an extra job to give money to people
*  that I don't wanna give money to
*  after the first little while.
*  So we bend ourselves out of our true being.
*  And I think the reason we love dogs so much
*  is that they love, but they love truly.
*  They love honestly.
*  They don't pretend to be something they're not.
*  And they don't have the empathy that says,
*  if your leg is broken, I will break my own leg
*  and lie down next to you so that I feel
*  exactly the same pain you're feeling.
*  It is not empathy to feel everything
*  the other person is feeling.
*  If they then take the broken leg example,
*  if you got hit by a car, you're lying there
*  screaming in anguish, and I felt your feeling
*  so strongly that I couldn't cope,
*  and I fell down in a faint.
*  I had a client once who has passed away now,
*  so I'll tell this anecdote.
*  Her husband was like you, he would give himself away.
*  And she gladly consumed all his life energy.
*  And one day he had a heart attack,
*  a near fatal heart attack.
*  And she called me and said,
*  I couldn't get him to take care of my needs
*  while he was having this heart attack.
*  He just had it.
*  And I was like, yeah, he couldn't help that.
*  And she said, well, I told him.
*  He said, I can't be there for you right now.
*  I'm having a heart attack.
*  And she said, you're not the one whose husband
*  may be dying from a heart attack.
*  She was so into consuming his energy
*  that she actually said that with a straight face.
*  Unbelievable.
*  She was expecting him to give empathy.
*  That's not empathy.
*  That's selling yourself out.
*  Empathy acknowledges self other awareness.
*  There are four components to a real empathy.
*  Self other awareness, I am not you.
*  As Byron Katie, one of my favorite spiritual teachers says,
*  my favorite thing about separate bodies
*  is that when you hurt, I don't.
*  It's not my turn.
*  So good.
*  So good.
*  Yeah, another one is emotion regulation.
*  So you see something that's horrific
*  and you can like, this is where you can use your skills
*  dealing with your emotions, you bring it down.
*  Okay, I'm a surgeon.
*  I'm dealing with a horrible ER accident.
*  I can't feel that.
*  I have to get to work.
*  So that's emotion regulation.
*  You can do that.
*  Self other awareness, emotion regulation,
*  are two other components.
*  But those are the two that I think
*  we really need to focus on.
*  If you hurt, I don't, it's not my turn.
*  And when you're hurting and I start to hurt too much
*  because you're hurting,
*  I can bring myself back into my own body, relax,
*  and be contented in my own skin
*  so that I can be present for you.
*  So here's the thing I love.
*  It's a short quote from a poem by Hafiz,
*  who was a 13th century Persian poet.
*  It's so simple.
*  Remember it though.
*  Troubled?
*  Then stay with me for I am not.
*  I love that.
*  Yeah, that's being yourself in a relationship.
*  Then stay with me for I am not.
*  But I'm really, really unhappy.
*  I see that.
*  And I'm not unhappy,
*  but I really, really wanna be together.
*  I really see that that's how you feel.
*  And I don't want it.
*  It's so interesting because I feel like
*  in the domain of work and with my friends
*  and largely with family,
*  giving feels great, and then people are sated,
*  and then they go on their way.
*  But I noticed a contrast with romantic partnerships
*  when, as I said, I maintain good relationships
*  with a couple of girlfriends that I had.
*  In some cases, I'm good friends with their husbands.
*  Like they actually one just came and visited
*  with their sister and her kid recently.
*  Like on just great platonic terms.
*  But for years, I didn't worry about them,
*  but I felt like I could still feel the energetic pull,
*  even though they weren't asking for anything.
*  And then when I attended their wedding,
*  this particular person's wedding,
*  I was like, oh, I was like, my work is done.
*  And I got to enjoy and still get to enjoy the friendship
*  with the whole family.
*  But it really showed me how much the whole relation,
*  so much of the relationship had been about
*  trying to make sure the other person was okay.
*  You make it your job to make them happy.
*  And it is never your job to make another person happy.
*  You can not do it.
*  Happiness is an inside job.
*  You cannot make another person happy.
*  You can't go far enough into someone else's sadness
*  to make them happy.
*  You can't go far enough into their sickness
*  to make them well.
*  You have to get out of your own sadness
*  and your own sickness,
*  and then stay in your integrity with love for them
*  and model what it is to be in your own skin.
*  It's the only one you're ever gonna have.
*  My oldest child, as a teenager,
*  I was so over-involved in everything.
*  And they gave me a song called Let Me Fall
*  by a man who had fallen from a tree
*  and he broke his spine, he was a paraplegic.
*  And he just says,
*  the one I will become will catch me.
*  Don't catch me anymore.
*  And it was so hard as a parent to let my child
*  have, suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.
*  And what they were telling me, they then pronouns,
*  was that this is my life and my suffering is my birthright.
*  And I am here to figure it out as I go.
*  And you are not loving me when you shove yourself
*  into my affairs to try to take away my suffering.
*  Let me fall.
*  What a mature and generous thing for them to say.
*  They are extraordinary.
*  It sounds like it.
*  This is your oldest.
*  The contrast and I think what drives a lot of,
*  what we're really talking about here is codependency.
*  Oh yes.
*  Yeah.
*  For those that don't know,
*  we haven't caught on.
*  Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding.
*  Right, exactly.
*  Is that sometimes when we cut people off
*  or we just say, hey, I can give, but only to this point.
*  Or you can get this aspect of me,
*  but not these other aspects.
*  Especially if they've been receiving them before,
*  they get pissed.
*  Oh yes.
*  I mean, this is, I mean, and it's unclear,
*  especially if the relationship had been different
*  up until then, that, you know, like,
*  that's why it sometimes feels unfair to do.
*  It's like, you know, it's one thing to invite someone over
*  for a drink, then to discover that they're an alcoholic,
*  continue to fill their glass, enjoy the exchange,
*  and then one day realize they're an alcoholic.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And I guess that term isn't used anymore.
*  I've been told by many audience members, forgive me.
*  It's alcohol use disorder.
*  I said that too, I'm sorry.
*  No, quite all right.
*  I think that field of addiction medicine is nascent enough
*  that we're still making the transition.
*  And I don't say this, by the way,
*  for political correctness.
*  I'm not a politically correct person.
*  It's just, I've had to learn to reframe these things
*  for the specific purpose of trying to be more,
*  to bring more people into the conversation.
*  Also, I like the sound of, I don't like the idea,
*  but the words alcohol use disorder,
*  the disorder piece is also controversial.
*  But what I love is that as soon as we start to name things
*  and rename things, we're all talking about those things.
*  And then there's no way out of the conversation.
*  So that's my kind of jujitsuing out of the,
*  so that means we have to talk about it,
*  just like autism spectrum disorder or autism
*  or neurotypical, atypical.
*  Well, guess what, folks?
*  Now we're all talking about it
*  and it needs to be talked about.
*  So in any case, at some point,
*  there's the idea like, I'm cutting you off.
*  And the person says, but this is what we do.
*  This is the kind of promise that you made.
*  And so then we find ourselves in like the other scripts
*  of like, well, now I'm like being bad.
*  I'm doing the right thing, but I'm breaking a promise,
*  which we're told from like the time we're little,
*  like you don't do.
*  But only in the eyes of the other person.
*  If you come back into your own integrity,
*  okay, is did I promise to always give more than I can?
*  Well, I did by my actions.
*  I established a precedent.
*  Isn't that a promise?
*  They say it's a promise.
*  No.
*  Or if I did make a promise, I was in error.
*  I apologize.
*  I made a mistake.
*  I promised something I couldn't really give.
*  Have you heard the term extinction burst?
*  In the notion of galaxies developing or something like that?
*  No, it's when pigeons are, well.
*  Awesome, I am way off.
*  The galactic pigeons.
*  I'm like trying to be Elon Musk here and you're talking,
*  no, it's about pigeons, cool.
*  It's about any animal.
*  I love pigeons.
*  I even have a pigeon tattoo.
*  I love pigeons.
*  Yeah, I do.
*  I love all the animals.
*  Anyway, if you give pigeons, they peck a lever
*  and they get a pellet at unpredictable intervals,
*  which is highly motivating.
*  It's the most highly motivating thing they can do.
*  So, and then if the pellets stop coming,
*  the pigeons go bananas.
*  They just perseverate.
*  Peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck.
*  They peck it a lot more.
*  They peck it angrily.
*  They insist that the researchers
*  promise them those pellets.
*  And then they just give up and go away
*  because the pellets stop coming.
*  When you have been giving too much and you realize that
*  and you say to stay in my integrity,
*  I have to pull back and care for myself
*  and that's where I stop.
*  And the other person will put on an extinction burst,
*  for sure.
*  And your job is to stay inside your integrity
*  until they stop pecking.
*  And they'll be much more healthy.
*  I had a golden retriever once
*  who would just come and bark to be petted.
*  Big, huge dog, but he was young.
*  And it was so annoying.
*  And we had to get a dog behaviorist to come in
*  because he was just barking at everybody constantly
*  to be petted.
*  And she said, when he does that, get up, walk across the room,
*  go into another room and shut the door in his face.
*  And we were like, oh, that would be cruel.
*  She's like, it's not cruel.
*  He'll understand it.
*  And I'll never forget watching him bark at someone.
*  Rawr, rawr, rawr.
*  And they got up, walked out, shut the door in his face.
*  He stood by the door and rawr.
*  And he went, eh.
*  He went over and lay down.
*  He was like, all right, well, that didn't work.
*  And that's ultimately what happens
*  when you stay inside your integrity
*  and don't let people play with you that way.
*  Don't let them tug you around.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's interesting because with work,
*  it's like, I love learning, organizing information,
*  having conversations like this
*  and sharing them with the world.
*  It feels kind of like the relationship to a dog.
*  It's like this reciprocity and the people don't like it.
*  Okay, and if you like it, great.
*  And if you love it, even better.
*  But I would be doing it anyway.
*  I'd be doing it anyway.
*  Like there's no feeling of loss.
*  There's no metabolizing of self, any of that.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  And I call it, in the book that I just wrote
*  called Beyond Anxiety, I talk about
*  when people like you live that way from their joy,
*  they begin to create economic ecosystems.
*  You create so much value that in multiple ways,
*  people start to, you can get streams of income.
*  People pay me to do this and I still can't believe it.
*  I come in here and I talk to my producer
*  who's also my business partner and my closest friend, Rob.
*  And I'm like, I can't believe they pay us to do this.
*  I can't believe it.
*  And that's also how I felt about science
*  the first time I looked down the microscope
*  and saw a slice of a particular brain area
*  called the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus.
*  And we had labeled this area.
*  I turned to Barbara Chapman, my graduate advisor there.
*  And I was like, this is amazing.
*  And her response was so funny.
*  She was also Harvard trained Radcliffe to be specific.
*  And she said, yeah, brains are really cool.
*  They're kind of like little walnuts.
*  And I was like, so Barbara,
*  one of the smartest people I ever met.
*  She was just like, and I was like, and I thought,
*  and then I looked around her lab.
*  I was doing rotations where you get to sample different labs
*  and you hope they'll take you.
*  And she had green counters in her lab
*  instead of black counters.
*  And she had pictures of mushrooms.
*  And she had this picture of a cat coming out of a farm silo.
*  It's like it's hat.
*  And I thought, I really like this lady.
*  Like, I want to work here.
*  I'm going to do my PhD here.
*  And I had already committed to another lab.
*  And I started sneaking into her laboratory at night.
*  Did you break the heart of the other lab?
*  She got over it.
*  So in the professional domain,
*  I'm a completely different animal
*  when it comes to these things.
*  I walked into the other woman's lab.
*  She's done tremendously well without me.
*  So I just said, listen, I'm going to join this other lab.
*  But I have no trouble doing that in the work domain.
*  None.
*  It's like, when I started the podcast,
*  sure, there were these voices in my head.
*  What are my colleagues going to think?
*  This and that.
*  And I was like, nah, I hope they're living their best life.
*  I'm going to live mine.
*  And I see them and some love it, some hate it.
*  And some, like really, I can tell.
*  I hear the judgments and I also hear the,
*  like, I love it, that kind of thing.
*  It's a mix.
*  Because public facing anything
*  is going to evoke different responses from people.
*  But I'm sort of like, you do you, I'll do me.
*  And we'll both be good.
*  We live in this weird economy
*  where you're supposed to get a job
*  and it's all based on factory work.
*  You're supposed to go to a place
*  and do something you don't really like
*  to get your little allowance and then you go home.
*  And that has only existed for the last couple of hundred
*  years since the industrial revolution.
*  Before that, people existed for hundreds of thousands
*  of years doing what?
*  Hunting, fishing, gardening, weaving,
*  singing songs, telling stories,
*  doing the things that we do as hobbies.
*  But we have this weird mindset that says, no,
*  if I do things that bring me joy, like a hobby does,
*  the things that people have been doing
*  for hundreds of thousands of years,
*  if I just put my joy out there and see what I can do
*  with the wild new creations of our particular time,
*  if I don't do the job, I'm being weird somehow
*  and it won't work.
*  But what I'm seeing is the economic structures
*  of this society are all being fractured.
*  They're falling apart around us.
*  And it's people who are afraid,
*  I used to watch this video of a tsunami
*  that hit Sendai, Japan in 2011, I think it was.
*  And this wave comes in and it eats a city in six minutes,
*  this one wave, and you watch the whole city
*  like be ripped to shreds in six minutes.
*  And people are running into the buildings
*  and then the buildings start to collapse
*  and you know there are people in there.
*  And I watched this and I thought there is so much change
*  in our culture, it's like that wave has hit us.
*  And then accidentally, I hit something in YouTube
*  or whatever and it switched to Mike Parsons
*  surfing one of the biggest waves ever filmed.
*  It was a rogue wave and it went up like 70 feet.
*  And the camera pulls back and here's this,
*  basically naked man on a board
*  with a wave that is like the wrath of God.
*  And he's this tiny little figure,
*  the wave is seven stories tall.
*  And he comes riding down the face of that
*  and it breaks over him and you think, oh, he's dead.
*  And then he shoots out of the spray, just like shouting.
*  And I thought those are the choices we have right now,
*  we can run into the institutions
*  that we think will keep us safe
*  and change will crush us and drown us and kill us.
*  Or we can deal with the fact
*  that there's a huge wave of change in our society right now
*  and everything's changing at an accelerating rate.
*  And we can risk running out naked and just with our joy
*  and just balance on our joy
*  and let the wave take us for a ride.
*  You're surfing.
*  That's, you are an example to the world
*  of someone who is balanced in his joy,
*  except in relationships, but you'll get over that.
*  Anyway.
*  It's taking some work.
*  It's taking some work.
*  There's a woman hanging on to the end of your surfboard.
*  It's not gonna suck.
*  Unfortunately, it's a lot more complicated than that.
*  But I am seeing a portal toward,
*  I guess what you're calling like true integrity
*  where in the back of my mind,
*  I have this like very vestigial understanding
*  of what all of that relationship stuff
*  actually looks like when it,
*  and feels like when it's right for me.
*  I just, I think it's not gonna look like
*  the way I try to script it out.
*  Do an ideal day with that relationship.
*  And it could be the weirdest thing you've ever heard of.
*  It will work.
*  I promise you.
*  I have a very weird relationship life.
*  That's reassuring to me.
*  Can't believe I'm gonna say this on this podcast.
*  So I have two partners.
*  Your partner's awesome.
*  Oh, I met, well, one, I just met one of them.
*  One was the very first relationship I ever had
*  with a woman that was 20 some years ago.
*  And then I was living on my ranch and meditating all day.
*  And my partner, Karen came to me
*  and this Australian poet Rowan was staying on our ranch
*  with some other people.
*  And Karen sat me down.
*  She said, Marty,
*  I have to tell you, I'm having very strong,
*  I don't know, maybe maternal feelings toward Rowan.
*  I was like, no, they're not maternal.
*  I'm not getting a maternal energy.
*  And I got hit by this blast of joy, joy, joy.
*  It was like that white light thing.
*  It was like, and I said, you're in love with her.
*  This is amazing.
*  Tell her to come in.
*  I'll go to the guest room.
*  You guys can have the, I was just like, happy, happy, happy.
*  And I looked for jealousy and I looked for,
*  I was like, this isn't supposed to work this way.
*  So Rowan came up and we all sat around talking.
*  And we sat around talking a lot more.
*  And we all sat on the same couch talking going,
*  this isn't weird, is it?
*  And after a couple of weeks,
*  we realized everybody was in love with everybody
*  and we couldn't live without each other.
*  And so that's how you exist.
*  That was eight years ago.
*  And we have a three-year-old named Lila who's delightful.
*  Awesome.
*  And it is, we call it feeling good by looking weird.
*  And you can cut it out on the podcast if it's too.
*  No, we have no master, no overlord.
*  Are you kidding me?
*  I mean, what we're talking about here is love, first of all.
*  Like, I mean, let's just be, you know,
*  of all the things to cut out of a podcast,
*  we're not gonna cut love out of a podcast.
*  Oh, I love that about this podcast
*  because a lot of people would.
*  Yeah, well, not me.
*  And for people that like balk at that
*  or it creates internal friction in them,
*  then I just invite you to, I don't know,
*  visit your compassionate witness self,
*  see if it's still there.
*  And if it's still there, then, you know, hey,
*  I actually believe that humans,
*  partially based on developmental wiring experiences,
*  but also just differences in wiring.
*  I just fundamentally believe in this.
*  You know, I mean, one of my closest friends,
*  my third postdoc, my third advisor,
*  who was my postdoc advisor at Stanford,
*  is the now, unfortunately, he died of pancreatic cancer,
*  is the late Ben Barris.
*  He was born an identical twin girl.
*  Wow. Okay.
*  Then went up through medical school, living as a woman,
*  graduate school as a woman,
*  and then transitioned to Ben pretty late in life.
*  So I only met Ben.
*  Ben was a close friend
*  and then unfortunately had,
*  probably because he had the BRCA2 mutation,
*  died of multiple cancers initiated by pancreatic cancer.
*  First transgender member of the National Academy of Sciences.
*  Wow.
*  I wrote his obituary for the journal Nature.
*  We were very, very close.
*  And just an amazing, very quirky dude, you know,
*  and didn't have a romantic partner,
*  at least not at the time when he passed,
*  or in the time that I knew him, to my knowledge.
*  And, you know, Ben used to say,
*  like, there are components of our wiring that are ubiquitous,
*  the parts that control breathing,
*  the parts that control heart,
*  and then there are parts of our wiring
*  that are just different.
*  And to me as a scientist, like, it makes perfect sense.
*  Like the notion that any of that would be controversial
*  is like, what?
*  Like, it doesn't make any sense whatsoever
*  that one would not believe
*  that people have differences in wiring,
*  because most people want to believe in differences in wiring
*  when it's like convenient for themselves.
*  So I really appreciate that you're sharing this,
*  and because yeah, every which version works.
*  And I also learned from my graduate advisor,
*  Barbara Chapman, she used to say,
*  tolerance has to go both ways.
*  So I also like love and applaud,
*  like the whatever traditional nuclear family,
*  is it still called that?
*  Oh my gosh, yes.
*  You know, so.
*  But I would love you to really sit down,
*  get incredibly authentic with yourself,
*  and say honestly, if I had the perfect romantic life,
*  what would it look like?
*  And be what you will call very selfish,
*  what I will call very much in your integrity.
*  Don't tell yourself any lies about what you really want.
*  Yeah, it's very strange,
*  but both Karen and I felt like
*  there was a tremendous absence
*  in a couple of years before Roe came into our life.
*  And we're just, it's like we're a three-legged stool,
*  two-legged stools do not make sense to us, they fall down.
*  Whatever comes into your vision of joy,
*  whatever makes you feel free,
*  write it down and read it often.
*  And when you get into a relationship,
*  read it even more often.
*  Maybe have the other person read it.
*  And let the other person read it.
*  Totally, that would be, that I can do.
*  As difficult as it is to have certain conversations,
*  I could certainly write things down
*  and just like slide in on below.
*  It's like a pre-nut.
*  Here's what I'm after.
*  Don't let me do the things in column B, it won't end well.
*  I love it.
*  And I really appreciate that you shared that.
*  And I know people listening will as well.
*  I hope so.
*  And if not, I read a book by Samantha Erby,
*  a wonderful comedian, and she says,
*  here's what you say when people tell you
*  that you're horrible and you're doing something awful.
*  You say, I like it.
*  No, this is.
*  Well, one of the reasons I oriented very young towards
*  and still love punk rock music, like that genre,
*  is because to me, I could be wrong.
*  Maybe classical music being an exception,
*  but to me, it's the only genre of music
*  where all the versions of self and emotions are welcome.
*  There's angry music.
*  There's like political music.
*  There's sad music.
*  There's music about friendship and camaraderie,
*  about loss.
*  And you look at the community,
*  like I'm really into this stuff.
*  So look at the community like that.
*  My good friend, Tim Armstrong,
*  has created around certain bands.
*  He's gonna be on the Mount Rushmore punk rock
*  or the great Joe Strummer from the Clash.
*  Political music.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Or Laura Jane Grace,
*  like one of the first outwardly facing transgendered people
*  in the punk rock community and does amazing music.
*  Well, it was against me.
*  And then Laura Jane Grace, I'm like,
*  she's a hero of mine.
*  One of my shortlist of heroes.
*  I love, love, love what she's done at so many levels.
*  And it's like, there's like this tapestry
*  of all the different humans and human experiences
*  in a kind of single genre.
*  And I don't know much about other genres of music,
*  but I don't see that.
*  I don't see that like maybe across the totality
*  of rock and roll or whatever.
*  But, you know, and so like if ever there was a sector
*  of life that's like all-inclusive, it's that.
*  But not because it's loud, it's fast, and it's anti.
*  It's like so much of it is like pro-social, right?
*  So I think there's a big misunderstanding around that.
*  So that ethos is something that's always resonated.
*  And I feel the same way about like relationships
*  or on social media.
*  One of the reasons I can go on social media
*  and not have it like spike my cortisol constantly
*  is I'm there and I'm like, okay,
*  there's some like mentally healthy people here,
*  some mentally unhealthy people here.
*  People are here to fight.
*  People are here to love.
*  People are here to find partners.
*  People are here to flirt.
*  And you know what?
*  People are here to attack me like, cool,
*  I'm glad I'm giving you a purpose for your morning,
*  you know, that kind of thing.
*  I try and just approach it all that way
*  where you just made all of this very clear
*  in a much more succinct way,
*  where you just said like, great, I like it.
*  Yeah, I like it.
*  It's awesome.
*  Yeah, yours with a real genuine sense of joy.
*  Yeah.
*  Like no like, well, I like it.
*  There's no friction in that statement.
*  It's just, I like it.
*  I really like it.
*  I like a lot.
*  I love that you like it a lot
*  and that you can say it that way.
*  Who can't, like if it's all love,
*  nobody can really, you can out love almost anything.
*  You're furious at me.
*  I like it.
*  I just out loved you.
*  And I think that's why Jesus said,
*  you know, charity never faileth.
*  It's not that you're gonna win everything
*  if you are a loving person,
*  is that no matter what happens,
*  it's like that self,
*  you're suffering, you're paying,
*  your codependency, whatever,
*  it loves it all.
*  Bring it.
*  It loves it all.
*  And that means that no matter what you come at me with,
*  I can hold that in a field of love.
*  And my experience is love.
*  What was the quote from Jesus?
*  It's, I don't know if it's from Jesus,
*  but in, I think it's in Paul,
*  says charity never faileth.
*  You know, love never fails.
*  And it's because I can say, I hate myself.
*  Yes, but I love the part of me that hates myself.
*  Just out loved you.
*  Well, of course the answer is gonna be yes.
*  I was gonna ask, were you always like this?
*  Meaning that you could hold this position
*  on the balance beam.
*  And then I feel like you've taken this balance beam
*  and like created this big mesa for others to stand on.
*  Cause it's a really stable place to be once you're there.
*  But getting to this place of like essential self
*  and the path to integrity,
*  I mean, can I just say it the way I feel it?
*  It's fucking difficult.
*  Yeah, that's what I was,
*  I was about to use that same word.
*  I think in order to be, to become stable,
*  I always say that the raw material for any good experience
*  is its opposite.
*  So I was messed, I was effed up beyond belief
*  that is snafu, these are both military terms.
*  Snafu means situation normal, all fucked up.
*  Fubar means fucked up beyond all recognition.
*  I was fubar.
*  Now I occasionally get snafu.
*  But I was so fubar that the suffering was so intense
*  that when I learned to come home,
*  the contrast was very sharp.
*  And I never ever want to,
*  I never wanna leave the consciousness
*  that that light is always with us.
*  And we can feel it if we're honest,
*  and that's all we have to do, be honest.
*  And there it is, boom, it's got us.
*  I feel like it starts with the scope of self.
*  Like we have to do this for ourselves
*  before we can do this with and for other people.
*  Yeah.
*  And then at some point, the fantasy in my mind, right?
*  Like it sounds like my mother, my mother,
*  from the youngest age I can remember in myself
*  trying to heal the world.
*  And I've seen the toll it's taken on her.
*  Like she'll call sometimes, I'll be like,
*  how's it going?
*  And like something will have happened in the news.
*  Like I can just tell like it really wears on her.
*  And it's hard for me to hear and see,
*  because I feel it too.
*  It's like, goodness, like do you feel
*  there's hope for our species?
*  I mean, I'm trying to not throw the whole problems
*  of the world at you, but-
*  No, I've been thinking about it.
*  I mean, like what?
*  I'm almost 50.
*  I feel like at this point I've seen enough,
*  like there's so much goodness in people,
*  but there's also like the capacity
*  for so much like misunderstanding, bad.
*  You got the developmental wiring,
*  you got the hurt people, hurt people.
*  We're all, everyone's doing the best they can.
*  Everyone wants safety and acceptance.
*  And they're just trying to find it this way.
*  And like, and then there are your truly bad actors
*  because they're either miswired or whatever.
*  And they're like creating havoc.
*  Is there any real hope for like a different version
*  of things that's persistent?
*  The first time I remember worrying about this, I was four.
*  And I'm 10 years older than you are.
*  But I knew at four that I was here
*  to try to help with something.
*  And as I grew up, it just wouldn't go away,
*  this feeling that I was supposed to help with something.
*  And in my teens, it became,
*  I need to help change the way people think.
*  I don't know.
*  And then I started noticing other people
*  who seemed to be like me.
*  And I would be like,
*  I think they're on the same team I'm on.
*  And I was like, what team?
*  What am I talking about?
*  And it all came to a head when I was in South Africa
*  in the wilderness.
*  And I had a dream that my ancestors were coming to visit me.
*  And I thought it was funny.
*  So I told it to some friends from the Shangan tribe
*  who reacted like this.
*  And then they ran.
*  And I was like, what did I do wrong?
*  And later that night,
*  we're all sitting around the fire, there are lions roaring.
*  They bring this little woman from Mozambique
*  and she's a Sangoma, she's a shaman.
*  And she did her divinatory system,
*  which is she threw the bones for me.
*  Because if you had dream I had,
*  you have to see a Sangoma right away
*  or bad things will happen.
*  So she said stuff about me that was true,
*  but she could have Googled it.
*  And it was weird when she looked at me,
*  I felt like these ice needles going through me.
*  It was not cute, but it was very intense.
*  And what she said was,
*  there are people being born to be healers
*  all over the world,
*  just like there are in the traditional tribes.
*  You need to go find them and tell them
*  what they're here to do.
*  They're here to heal the world
*  and they need the wisdom that the traditional people had
*  and they need their technology.
*  And it was so interesting because she was like confused.
*  She acted very frightened and confused
*  by what she was saying to me.
*  She had to get a group of people behind her
*  who would chant, we agree, we agree.
*  Because she was freaked out.
*  But I think that in every traditional group
*  of 100 to 150 people,
*  there were a few healers that were recognized
*  by the elders as people who were highly sensitive.
*  They were interested in nature and science.
*  They were interested in animals.
*  They were interested in the mystery.
*  They were interested in the arts.
*  They were performers,
*  but they were also very introverted and thinky thinky.
*  It's an archetype of healing, of medicine person.
*  The coaches I coach, I call it wayfinders,
*  which is a term from an anthropologist.
*  If you're born in that archetype,
*  if you have that phenotype,
*  I believe it's a phenotype.
*  And I believe it crops up in every 100 to 150 people
*  several times.
*  And our culture has no word for it and no path for it.
*  But if we are going to save the world,
*  we will draw on whatever was born into us
*  that makes us wanna heal things.
*  And we will use the technologies we've developed
*  and we will use our joy and our refusal to participate
*  in the nonsense of our culture.
*  And we will hold firm and we will try to change
*  the way humanity lives on this planet.
*  And I don't know which way it's gonna go,
*  but I'm in the game.
*  And I kind of think you are too.
*  I have a feeling I am too.
*  And I'm certain that I'm in it thanks to you.
*  Seriously, in large part.
*  I've told the story earlier that the path I'm on
*  and the fact that anyone's listening to this
*  and watching it is the consequence of having read your books
*  and done the exercises and we'll continue to do them.
*  So I must say there really aren't words
*  to express how much this means to me
*  that you would come here.
*  Take the time to share with us your wisdom
*  and to delve into some topics
*  that are of particular interest to me.
*  Because I like everyone else.
*  I'm a work in progress who's curious about the best ways
*  to move forward.
*  And yeah, every time you speak
*  and just when you show up someplace,
*  it's an incredible thing.
*  Everybody learns, everybody gets better
*  and everyone walks away with tools and empowerment.
*  And I just wanna say thank you so much.
*  There's really not a whole lot else.
*  Same to you.
*  You're just looking in the mirror.
