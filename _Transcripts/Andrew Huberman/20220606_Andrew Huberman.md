# Dr. Paul Conti: Therapy, Treating Trauma & Other Life Challenges | Huberman Lab Podcast #75
**Andrew Huberman:** [June 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOl28gj_RXw)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
*  where we discuss science
*  and science-based tools for everyday life.
*  I'm Andrew Huberman,
*  and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
*  at Stanford School of Medicine.
*  Today, my guest is Dr. Paul Conti.
*  Dr. Conti is a psychiatrist who did his training
*  at Stanford School of Medicine,
*  and then went on to be chief resident
*  at Harvard Medical School.
*  He now runs the Pacific Premier Group,
*  which is a collection of psychiatrists and therapists
*  focusing on solving complex human problems,
*  including trauma, addiction, personality,
*  and psychiatric disorders.
*  Today, we discuss trauma in detail
*  and the therapeutic process in detail.
*  For instance, we discuss what is trauma?
*  How do you know if you have trauma?
*  Dr. Conti shares with us, for instance,
*  that not every experience that we think is traumatic
*  is necessarily traumatic,
*  and yet many people might have trauma
*  without even realizing it.
*  We also talk about the therapeutic process generally.
*  For instance, how to pick a therapist,
*  how to best approach and go through therapy,
*  and how to evaluate whether or not therapy
*  and your relationship to the therapist is working or not.
*  We also talk about self-therapies,
*  because we acknowledge that not everyone has access to
*  or can afford therapy.
*  And we talk about drug therapies,
*  for instance, antidepressants, antipsychotics.
*  We talk about alcohol, cannabis, ketamine,
*  and the psychedelics, including psilocybin, LSD,
*  and we talk about the clinical use of MDMA
*  and what the future of that looks like.
*  The reason for bringing Dr. Conti onto this podcast
*  is because I see him as the person who has the greatest
*  and most holistic view of therapy,
*  trauma, drug therapies, talk therapies,
*  and how self-therapy and work with others
*  can be integrated for both healing and growing
*  from difficult circumstances.
*  Dr. Conti is also the author of an exceptional book
*  entitled, Trauma, The Invisible Epidemic,
*  How Trauma Works and How We Can Heal From It.
*  That book describes trauma and its many features
*  and many tools, some of which we discuss
*  on the podcast today.
*  So whether or not you have trauma or not,
*  by the end of today's episode,
*  you will have a much deeper understanding
*  about what trauma is.
*  In fact, I'm confident that you will gain insight
*  into whether or not you have trauma or not,
*  whether or not people close to you have trauma or not,
*  and the various paths to recovering
*  and indeed growing from trauma that we can all take.
*  As you'll soon learn, Dr. Conti
*  is an exceptional communicator and has a unique window
*  into the trauma and therapeutic process
*  that I know that all of us can benefit from.
*  Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
*  is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
*  It is, however, part of my desire and effort
*  to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
*  and science-related tools to the general public.
*  In keeping with that theme,
*  I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
*  Our first sponsor is Roca.
*  Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
*  that are of the absolute highest quality.
*  The company was founded
*  by two all-American swimmers from Stanford,
*  and everything about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
*  was designed with performance in mind.
*  I spent a lifetime working on the visual system,
*  and I can tell you that our visual system
*  has to contend with a lot of different challenges.
*  For instance, when you move from a shady area
*  to a brightly lit area,
*  your eyes and your brain have to adjust
*  in order for you to be able to see clearly.
*  Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed
*  with the biology of the visual system in mind,
*  so you never notice those transitions.
*  They're very seamless.
*  You always see things with perfect clarity.
*  The other terrific thing about Roca eyeglasses
*  and sunglasses is they are extremely lightweight.
*  Most of the time, I can't even remember
*  that I'm wearing them.
*  I wear readers at night,
*  and I wear sunglasses sometimes in the daytime
*  when it is very bright or I'm driving and so on.
*  If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,
*  go to roca.com, that's R-O-K-A.com,
*  and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off
*  on your first order.
*  Again, that's R-O-K-A.com,
*  and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
*  Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker.
*  InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
*  that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
*  to help you better understand your body
*  and help you reach your health goals.
*  I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
*  for the simple reason that many of the factors
*  that impact our immediate and long-term health
*  can only be measured and assessed with a quality blood test.
*  And nowadays, with the advent of modern DNA tests,
*  we can also get insight into, for instance,
*  our biological age and see how that compares
*  to our chronological age.
*  And of course, despite what our birthday cake screams
*  back at us, it is our biological age that really matters.
*  If you're going to get blood tests or DNA tests, however,
*  you need to be able to interpret the data.
*  And that's really where InsideTracker stands apart.
*  A lot of companies will give you a DNA test or a blood test.
*  They'll send you values of hormones,
*  metabolic markers, et cetera,
*  but you don't know what to do with those data.
*  InsideTracker is a very easy to use platform.
*  So when you get the numbers back,
*  you can click on any of the numbers
*  that either are in range or out of range,
*  too low, too high, et cetera.
*  And it will direct you towards specific behavioral tools.
*  So lifestyle factors, nutritional tools,
*  supplement tools, et cetera,
*  that can help you bring those numbers
*  into the ranges that are best for you,
*  which is really an exceptional tool
*  that makes all the blood tests and DNA tests
*  really exceptionally powerful.

*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Blinkist.
*  Blinkist is an app that has thousands of nonfiction books
*  condensed down to just 15 minutes each of key takeaways
*  that you can read or listen to
*  to extract the most important knowledge from those books.
*  I love reading physical books,
*  literally physical hard copies of books,
*  and I like listening to audio books.
*  However, I also like to revisit books
*  that I've read or listened to.
*  And sometimes I just want to get the key points
*  or the key takeaways from a book
*  that I've never read or listened to.
*  Blinkist is terrific for all of that.
*  For instance, when researching our episodes on sleep,
*  one of the books that I read and found very valuable
*  is Matt Walker, Professor at UC Berkeley's book,
*  "'Why We Sleep."
*  I've read that book,
*  but then I wanted to also make sure
*  that I hit the key takeaways.
*  Blinkist was essential for that.
*  Other books that I've read before
*  and that I own and enjoy,
*  but I listen to the Blinkist version of from time to time
*  are things like Tim Ferriss's,
*  "'For Our Body' or Tim Ferriss's,
*  "'For Our Chef' book, both of which are excellent
*  or Nassim Taleb's, "'The Black Swan.'"
*  And there are many other titles as well.
*  Blinkist is also a great way to finally get through
*  many of the books that you've been meaning to read,
*  but haven't had time for.
*  With Blinkist, you get unlimited access to read or listen
*  to a massive library of condensed nonfiction books.
*  Right now, Blinkist has a special offer
*  just for our Huberman Lab podcast audience.
*  If you go to blinkist.com slash Huberman,
*  you can get a free seven-day trial
*  and get 25% off a Blinkist Premier membership.

*  And now for my discussion with Dr. Paul Conti.
*  Paul, thank you so much for being here today.
*  Well, thank you so much for having me.
*  I've been looking forward to this
*  and I've received a ton of questions about trauma,
*  about therapy, about how to assess where one is
*  in their own arc of problems and addressing familial issues
*  and relationship issues and so forth.
*  We could just start off very basic
*  and just get everyone oriented.
*  How should we define trauma?
*  We all have hard experiences.
*  Some of them we might ruminate on more than others,
*  but what is trauma?
*  To make the definition relevant,
*  I think we have to look at trauma
*  as not anything negative that happens to us, right?
*  But something that overwhelms our coping skills
*  and then leaves us different as we move forward.
*  So it changes the way that our brains function, right?
*  And then that change is evident in us
*  as we move forward through life.
*  So how do we know if we have trauma or not?
*  I've heard before everyone has trauma.
*  For instance, I've heard that if we are a child
*  or when we are a child and we request love from a parent
*  or attention from a parent, if they dismiss us,
*  that that's a micro trauma.
*  Is that overstating or unfair to the real issue of trauma?
*  Do we all have trauma?
*  What are micro traumas?
*  What are macro traumas?
*  Right.
*  I think traumas that we might categorize
*  as disappointments, right?
*  Or things that are negative, but not deeply impactful,
*  I think is not a helpful definition, right?
*  I think the helpful definition is something
*  that rises to the magnitude of really changing us
*  and something that we can see both in how we behave,
*  we can see it in mood, anxiety, behavior, sleep,
*  physical health, so we can identify it
*  and we can also see it in brain changes.
*  So the fact that we become say more hypervigilant, right?
*  We become more vigilant and then we can see
*  that different parts of the brain are more active.
*  So that definition, that definition captures how trauma,
*  if it rises to a certain level, like what we would say,
*  trauma that makes a post-trauma syndrome, right?
*  Leaves us different, I think is the helpful definition
*  of trauma because it's a clinical definition, right?
*  It changes in us as people and we can map those changes
*  to identifiable shifts in our brain function.
*  How do we know if we've been changed by something?
*  I mean, I can think back to childhood events
*  where some kid on the playground or in the classroom
*  said something I didn't like, something negative about me.
*  I think most people can do that.
*  We have a great memory for the kid that said something awful
*  or the parent or teacher that said something awful
*  that really felt like it hurt us
*  or at least it stuck with us.
*  So clearly one's brain, my brain in this example,
*  has been changed by that event such that I remember it.
*  But how do we know if something has actually changed
*  the way that we are because of course we don't know
*  how we would be otherwise?
*  Right, that's difficult, right?
*  It's doable but it's difficult because the response.
*  So if the trauma rises to the level of changing our brains
*  and I don't just mean like we have a new memory, right?
*  So we can have memories of something that was negative,
*  and in that sense it changes the brain
*  because now there's something we can call to mind,
*  but it doesn't change the functioning of the brain.
*  If trauma rises to the level of changing the functioning
*  of our brains, then there's almost always a reflex
*  of guilt and shame around the trauma that can lead us
*  and often leads us to bury it, to avoid it,
*  to feel that now there's something negative inside of me
*  and it feels shameful or it feels like no one else
*  would accept it, right?
*  So what happens is people tend to avoid looking
*  at the change in them, which is exactly the opposite
*  of what needs to be done, right?
*  The idea of in a viral pandemic, right?
*  We wanna stay away from one another and isolate, right?
*  But with the trauma epidemic, we need to communicate
*  with other people, we need to communicate and put words
*  to what's gone on inside of us.
*  And very often a person knows, I mean, I've done
*  so much clinical work over about 20 years
*  that has focused on trauma and a lot of the times
*  the person knows, right?
*  But they're not admitting it to themselves
*  because they're afraid of it, right?
*  They don't know what to do, but if they start talking,
*  then they'll talk about the event or the situation,
*  it could be something acute or it could be something chronic
*  that really has been harmful to them, right?
*  And then they feel different afterwards.
*  And like, oh, after that I started thinking differently,
*  feeling differently, but that doesn't always happen.
*  Sometimes it's a process of exploration through dialogue,
*  right, whether it's written or whether it's spoken
*  of the person sort of exploring the changes
*  inside of themselves, maybe changes to their self-talk
*  inside, changes to their thoughts about the world
*  and whether they can navigate safely and readily in it.
*  And in anchors as I talk about this, the example I'll use
*  at times is the example of my own life where,
*  when I was much younger in my early 20s,
*  my younger brother took his life by suicide.
*  And the response of guilt and shame
*  and hiding all of it inside of me was,
*  it's just very dramatic, but I wasn't acknowledging it,
*  because I didn't know what to do about it.
*  And I felt guilty and I felt responsible
*  and I felt ashamed.
*  So there was an avoidance inside of me.
*  And then I wasn't saying to myself, hey, before this,
*  you thought that you could be effective
*  and you could make your way in the world.
*  And if you were a good person and you worked hard,
*  you could make a difference, right?
*  And then afterwards I thought, I can't get anywhere,
*  the world's against me.
*  And I felt like, oh, my options are all gone.
*  And I was like 24 years old, right?
*  So I didn't see that the change was in me,
*  but I was taking care of myself poorly.
*  Like there was enough going on that was unhealthy
*  that I couldn't avoid the realization that like,
*  hey, I'm different now.
*  And in these ways that are automatic,
*  my reflex to, can I make my way in the world?
*  Can I have a good life?
*  Can I be happy?
*  Well, my reflexes to that were all different.
*  And they were coming through the lens
*  of heightened anxiety, heightened vigilance,
*  a sense of guilt, a sense of shame,
*  and a sense of non-belonging in the world.
*  And was ultimately good and helpful people around me
*  and my own realization and hey,
*  things are not going well, right?
*  That led me to then get some help
*  and to be able to talk about it and realize like,
*  oh my gosh, like I need to face these things
*  that are going on inside of me.
*  From a psychoanalytic, psychological,
*  and maybe even a neuroscience perspective, two questions.
*  Why do you think that when we experience trauma,
*  these things that we call guilt and shame surface,
*  you know, everything you're telling me is that
*  in the end that's not adaptive.
*  Why would we be built that way?
*  So that's the first question.
*  And then the second question is,
*  you know, how should we conceptualize guilt and shame?
*  You know, I think that we hear guilt, we hear shame.
*  You know, how should we think about it?
*  I mean, those emotions must exist in us for some reason.
*  But in this case, it seems like they don't serve us well.
*  So maybe in that order or in reverse order,
*  you know, what is guilt really?
*  What is shame really?
*  And why is it that we seem to be reflexively wired
*  to feel guilty and feel ashamed when that's
*  the exact opposite of what we need to do
*  in the case of trauma?
*  Right, right.
*  No, I think these are great questions.
*  And I don't think anyone knows the answers for sure,
*  but my read of all of that is that there's something
*  adaptive that has happened in us through evolution
*  that now becomes maladaptive in the way we live
*  in the modern world, right?
*  So if you think of through most of human development,
*  you know, people weren't living that long, right?
*  And the idea was to survive and reproduce.
*  So traumatic things that happened to us,
*  it would make sense for them to stay with us, right?
*  So, you know, if you ate a new food
*  and got really, really sick,
*  it's like you better remember that, right?
*  You know, if you see someone from the group of people,
*  you know, a couple of miles away, right?
*  And one of those people attacks you, right?
*  It's like you better remember that.
*  So the traumatic things that are sort of emblazoned
*  in our brain are built to last, right?
*  Things that are positive will generate some emotion
*  inside of us, but things that are profoundly negative
*  are much more likely to stay with us.
*  And I think that that was adaptive, right?
*  When all of that was about survival, right?
*  And I think the same thing is true with, say, shame, right?
*  So I think here it makes sense to talk a little bit,
*  and actually I'm interested if your thoughts about this,
*  right, that the limbic system, right?
*  So the system often is called the emotion system, right?
*  In our brains has actually, of course,
*  varying function, right?
*  And one aspect is affect, right?
*  So affect is aroused in us, which I think the meaning then
*  is it's created in us without our choice, right?
*  So if we're walking down the road
*  and someone jumps in front of us or pushes us, right?
*  Then there's a response of fear, anger, right?
*  Heart starts beating faster, you know,
*  more blood to the muscles, you know,
*  we're getting ready to fight, right, or run, right?
*  And then we become aware of it, right?
*  So the aroused affect in us is also about survival,
*  and it has a very deep impact upon us,
*  and shame is an aroused affect.
*  So it can be raised in us without our choice,
*  and it's very powerful, which if you think about that,
*  is an extremely strong deterrent, right?
*  So if you had, you know, imagine a tribe or group of people,
*  right, that are sheltered together and, you know,
*  someone eats half the food at night or something, right?
*  And like, there's a very negative response, right?
*  And that person feels shame,
*  because shame is so powerful to control behavior, right?
*  So the way that trauma can change our brains
*  and stay with us in a way that says, be more vigilant,
*  look at the world in a different way,
*  act more defensively, right?
*  And how that links to shame and to guilt.
*  So then guilt becomes what gets called feeling, technically,
*  where we relate the aroused affect to ourselves, right?
*  So shame, the aroused affect, and guilt, the next step,
*  right, when the shame gets related to self,
*  are such profound behavioral interventions and deterrents,
*  right, that you can see, I think,
*  how evolutionarily kind of all makes sense.
*  If we're fighting for survival, you know,
*  and we're an elder statesman if we make it to 20, right?
*  This makes sense, but it doesn't make sense in a world
*  where we live much longer, right?
*  We navigate in all sorts of different ways,
*  and there's so much coming at us that can be traumatizing.
*  I mean, if you think about the news, right?
*  I mean, how many times have I written a prescription
*  for someone that says, no more news, right?
*  Or like-
*  You've actually written those prescriptions?
*  Oh, yes, yes.
*  So glance at the news, like look at the news for news.
*  Anything going on I need to know, right?
*  But what are people doing is they're looking at it
*  and they're clicking and they're clicking,
*  and there's a sense of being like enthralled
*  in a very frightening way with the horrors
*  that are in front of us.
*  And it shows how, yes, trauma can come through acute things
*  that happen to us.
*  Trauma can come through chronic things, chronic denigration,
*  whether it's based upon socioeconomic status,
*  immigrant, immigration status, race, religion,
*  sexuality, gender identity, these chronic traumas, right,
*  of being denigrated by the society around us
*  or treated as less than can change the brain.
*  But vicarious experiences can too, right?
*  And we know this is not theoretical.
*  We know that the changes in the brain
*  can come from vicarious experiences too,
*  which is why people who are glued to the news
*  and then feeling like, oh my goodness,
*  like what is happening?
*  You know, the mothers in the Ukraine
*  who've lost babies in the war,
*  and like there are things that are so terrifying
*  that if we spend so much time with that,
*  it has a similar effect.
*  So our brains are built to change from trauma,
*  but not in the way we experience trauma
*  and not in the way that we live life
*  in terms of the nature of living life
*  and the duration of life in the modern world
*  where these traumas that happen to us
*  are often so bad for us
*  because they change how our brain is functioning
*  and then our entire orientation to the world is different.
*  And that could be for, you know, years and years
*  and decades and decades.
*  It brings so much misery and suffering,
*  and at times it brings death.
*  If you think about 100,000 overdose deaths
*  in this country in a year, 100,000.
*  Where is so much of that arising from?
*  As a person who's treated addiction very intensively
*  over many years, I think that, well, I feel sure
*  that the majority of addiction that I see and treat
*  arises ultimately, the roots of it are in trauma
*  and are in trying to soothe something that's stuck inside
*  that the person isn't letting outside
*  because of the guilt and shame,
*  but it's running around in their head
*  and is tormented by it.
*  And now there's a pull for these drugs
*  or sometimes medicines to soothe.
*  So the opiates that were given after a minor surgery, right,
*  are like, okay, yeah, they help the pain
*  from the minor surgery,
*  but what they're really helping is the pain inside, right?
*  But that very quickly turns into addiction danger risk,
*  and we see that over and over again
*  and not in a theoretical way.
*  Like I see that in people who have been in my practice
*  with addiction arising from trauma
*  who have subsequently died.
*  So it's sort of writ large in our existence
*  in the modern world.
*  Incredible to me that this is the way it works.
*  What I mean by that is this idea that I've heard about before,
*  I think it was a Freudian concept of a repetition compulsion
*  that this is what boggles my mind as I'm hearing this.
*  If something happens to us or we observe something traumatic,
*  and instead of acknowledging that
*  and trying to distance from it,
*  there seems to be a reflex of shame and guilt in many cases
*  and stuffing it away.
*  And then a repetition of behaviors
*  to continue to try and to stuff it away.
*  Like you're trying to pack, I don't know,
*  recently I was packing a home
*  and trying to get a sleeping bag back into the bag.
*  It seems like it's always on a mushroom out the top,
*  this kind of thing.
*  It takes a lot of ongoing effort.
*  And at the same time that if this thing really exists,
*  this repetition compulsion,
*  people will return over and over again
*  to the kinds of scenarios
*  or at least the kinds of emotional states
*  that look just like the trauma or resemble it in some way.
*  So the question I have for you is,
*  is the repetition compulsion a real thing?
*  And why would we be wired that way?
*  My understanding of this concept of the repetition compulsion
*  is that we all want to solve our traumas
*  and it allows us to put ourselves into micro or,
*  again, macro versions of that over and over again.
*  We get to run the experiment again and again
*  in an attempt to solve it.
*  In the case of taking a drug that it's clear,
*  certain drugs like opioids,
*  it's clear how that would not allow us to deal with it.
*  It's just masking the emotional state.
*  But why is it, for instance,
*  that somebody who experiences sexual trauma
*  then places themselves into circumstances
*  of more sexual trauma?
*  Why is it that somebody who is in an abusive relationship
*  goes on to have a second and third or fourth verbally
*  or physically abusive relationship?
*  I mean, on the face of it,
*  you just go, that makes no sense.
*  And yet we see this over and over and over again.
*  Yes.
*  The first thing I would say about the validity
*  of the repetition compulsion concept is a strong yes.
*  Like yes, we see that over and over.
*  It's not necessarily in everyone,
*  but boy, it is in a lot of people who have suffered trauma.
*  And I think there's a very good reason.
*  On the surface of it, it's like, it makes no sense.
*  But then if we think, well,
*  how does our brains actually function?
*  We're sort of trained, at least in Western society,
*  I think, to think of ourselves as logical creatures.
*  That like, oh, we're logical
*  and ultimately everything in us can just boil down to logic.
*  And if we think about it enough,
*  we're gonna understand how to make the right decisions,
*  which is completely not true.
*  The limbic system, the emotion system, so to speak,
*  inside of us always trumps logic.
*  If you think about, does it ever make sense
*  to run into a burning building?
*  I mean, logic says no.
*  But if someone you love is in the burning building,
*  people run right in.
*  Because the limbic system says yes.
*  So when logic and emotion come head to head,
*  emotion wins all the time.
*  If emotion is powerful enough, it will always win.
*  And so the limbic system is so important.
*  And the limbic system does not care
*  about the clock or the calendar.
*  And that's the answer, and I'll sort of say why,
*  to the repetition compulsion.
*  So the limbic system doesn't know,
*  like, oh, it's now, it's today, it's May, it's 2022.
*  It just doesn't care at all.
*  So how I would relate that to the repetition compulsion
*  is when people are repeating,
*  what they're trying to do is to make things right.
*  With the idea that if we can repeat the situation
*  and make it right, it will fix everything.
*  Which makes perfect sense if we think,
*  well, where is that concept coming from?
*  It's coming from the emotional part of the brain
*  that wants relief from suffering of the trauma
*  and does not understand the clock or the calendar.
*  So if I can solve something now,
*  I will also solve something in the past.
*  Which is why I can't tell you how many times
*  I've sat with someone and said,
*  we're starting to do therapy.
*  And the person will say, oh gosh, like I know,
*  look, you just can't help me.
*  I mean, my last seven relationships have been abusive.
*  And I'll say back something sometimes,
*  like, well, look, if you tell me
*  that you've had seven relationships
*  that have been abusive in different ways,
*  I'll agree with you.
*  Like, I only say that
*  because that's never what someone says.
*  But I think what you're gonna tell me is
*  you've kind of had the same relationship seven times.
*  It's not seven things, it's one, right?
*  And that's always, I don't think one time yet
*  that has failed to be the case.
*  And that's how, so if you think about it,
*  that's how we start to elucidate what's going on.
*  So let me have the light bulb that goes off.
*  Like, I have not had seven different abusive relationships.
*  I have had one that I have repeated seven times.
*  And now we start getting to what's really going on
*  and what needs to happen.
*  That person needs to face what happened
*  in that original abusive relationship.
*  And it always comes down to the same sort of concepts
*  of the person feeling terrified
*  while the abuse was going on,
*  feeling guilty, feeling ashamed,
*  feeling like, oh, they brought it on themselves,
*  they deserve it, they don't deserve anything better,
*  because the brain is trying to make sense of it.
*  Or I thought I could make that okay, but I couldn't.
*  And then there's more guilt and more shame.
*  And if that's stuck inside of someone,
*  if that's bundled up inside of someone,
*  like a medical abscess inside a person,
*  a walled off infection inside the body,
*  this is the same concept in the brain,
*  then of course the limbic system is gonna wanna fix that.
*  And it fixes it by trying to,
*  let's recreate that situation and make it right this time.
*  And that's, I mean, it's, I think,
*  one of the best examples of how the right approach,
*  of how like, let's look at that, let's talk about that.
*  What's really going on there?
*  Wait, who should feel guilty and ashamed?
*  Is it the person who was abused
*  or the person who was abusing?
*  And we can get at what's going on inside the person.
*  And that's what changes that.
*  And then the eighth relationship
*  can be entirely different than the first seven.
*  And I see that all the time.
*  I mean, this isn't esoteric or soft.
*  Like I see that play out clinically over and over again.
*  And why do things get better?
*  Because we go to the trauma and we unlock it.
*  It's not hidden inside where it can control things.
*  We bring it to the surface.
*  And then we can take away its power.
*  I keep hearing in this narrative
*  that so much of our reflexive response to trauma,
*  both emotional and the repetition compulsion
*  in terms of behaviors is about some very deep attempt
*  to change the past.
*  Yes.
*  And in fact, in an offline conversation,
*  I recall you saying something about this,
*  that the number of behaviors and thoughts
*  and avoidance of behaviors and avoidance of thoughts
*  that human beings put in to try and change the past
*  is remarkable and eerie and maladaptive, it sounds like.
*  And that really stuck with me
*  because I think we all want to feel like we're in control
*  of our future and how we feel in the moment.
*  And to some extent, it works for a brief while.
*  There's this thing that happened
*  and it evokes some internal arousal
*  and then you have to know what to do with that arousal.
*  And I think for many people, including myself,
*  there's this fundamental question,
*  okay, the thought about the thing, the event,
*  or events, plural, evokes this arousal,
*  this internal state makes some people
*  feel sleepy and exhausted.
*  Other people feel really anxious.
*  Other people feel angry.
*  Arousal has all these different dimensions, as you know.
*  And then there's this question of what to do with it.
*  And I'd love to hear maybe even just a top contour
*  prescriptive of what does one do?
*  I'll even just put myself in it.
*  What do I do?
*  So I'm feeling upset about something.
*  I feel like my options are healthy catharsis.
*  I can tell the story, feel it.
*  I can pack it down.
*  I know we hear that it's bad to pack it down,
*  but of course one has to be functional in life
*  and deal with things and we have responsibilities
*  at work and relational responsibilities, et cetera.
*  We need to sleep at night.
*  So catharsis, healthy catharsis,
*  packing it down at the other extreme,
*  telling the story.
*  And yet I think a lot of people are afraid
*  to tell the story because in that telling,
*  there's a, perhaps a reemergence of the arousal.
*  It's a greater, I mean, is that what people mean
*  when they say things are gonna get worse
*  before they get better?
*  I mean, so I guess the simple version
*  of this long-winded question is,
*  it's clear we need to confront these things.
*  We can't change the past by a reflexive response
*  isn't gonna do that efficiently.
*  And so how do we deal with arousal?
*  How does one take what they feel inside
*  about something shameful?
*  What do you do with it in a moment?
*  And does that have to be done in the presence
*  of a skilled trained therapist
*  or as I'm driving to work in the morning
*  and something comes up, I can't deal with this right now,
*  comes to mind, what do I do?
*  Do I deal with it right then?
*  I know this is a big multi-dimensional question,
*  but I think it's the one that a lot of people grapple with.
*  We wanna deal with things.
*  How do we deal with that internal arousal?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  We so often try and change the trauma of the past
*  in order to control the future.
*  And what that really adds up to
*  is the trauma of the past dominates our present, right?
*  And it doesn't have to be that way.
*  And remember, we're talking about traumas
*  that rise to the level of changing the brain.
*  So as you're saying, that involves re-experience.
*  It involves hypervigilance, increased arousal,
*  it changes in mood states, changes in anxiety,
*  changes in sleep, changes in behavior.
*  So these are all changes that in a sense,
*  push towards dominating our present, right?
*  And then we're not really living in the present, right?
*  As we're trying to control the future.
*  We're not gonna do a great job of controlling our future
*  if we're not really living in the present, right?
*  And so the way to come at that,
*  again, in the moment, if we're saying,
*  okay, in the moment, if I need to fall asleep, right?
*  I might say, okay, let me try and put that out of my mind.
*  Let me try and thought redirect.
*  So there's short-term strategies
*  that can let us be functional
*  in the context of these changes.
*  But the answer is to go look directly at that thing, right?
*  Look at that trauma, explore that trauma.
*  And sure, that can be done with a professional
*  and sometimes that's what makes sense, but not always, right?
*  Sometimes it can be done by talking to another person,
*  right?
*  Writing it down, right?
*  Look at what's going on inside of me
*  that my mind is so stuck to this.
*  Let's explore that because it's almost as if we're,
*  we're so afraid so often of looking at the trauma
*  that has changed us,
*  that we'll look anywhere but at that, right?
*  So it's like it's hidden in a closet
*  and we'll shine the light everywhere else,
*  but we're not gonna open that door.
*  And that's where people will say the same as ever
*  over and over and I myself have thought this at times,
*  like, oh, if I talk about that,
*  I'm gonna start crying and never stop, right?
*  Or I'm gonna just fall apart, right?
*  Which is never what happens.
*  No one ever starts crying and never stops, right?
*  What ends up happening is when the person puts words to it,
*  right, it could be in writing,
*  it could be talking to a trusted other
*  or with a therapist, right?
*  Things start to change.
*  I mean, just the fact that you can talk about it,
*  you can put words to it and other people don't recoil, right?
*  I mean, how many times has someone said something
*  for the first time, right?
*  And when they're telling me about the trauma,
*  there's such an anxious like,
*  looking like as if I'm gonna be,
*  I'm gonna recoil from it, right?
*  Meaning I'm going to recoil from them, right?
*  And then there's a sense of surprise if the person says,
*  well, you know, I was abused by this coach
*  when I was a kid, right?
*  Or so, and there's not, okay,
*  there's not a response of recoiling.
*  You can see the change and people will say a lot like,
*  wow, like I can't believe,
*  like you can like hear me say that
*  and be okay with it, right?
*  I mean, so you think about what's going on inside of them,
*  like what a sense of shame,
*  a sense of, you know, this is something awful about me
*  for people to recoil from.
*  And it's just not true,
*  but here's where trauma is, it's insidious, right?
*  And it's pervasive, right?
*  Because if that convinces us to continually hide it away,
*  then how do we explore it?
*  Like, you know, that example of the person who says,
*  okay, I was abused by a coach when I was a child.
*  I mean, I'm thinking of a couple of very real cases, right?
*  People that I've taken care of.
*  And once they start talking about it,
*  then they start talking about how, you know,
*  they were just innocent kids, right?
*  And like, they didn't know,
*  and like they really wanted to be on the team
*  where this coach was treating them as special.
*  And now they can look at themselves from the outside, right?
*  They can look at themselves
*  like they would look at someone else, right?
*  You think it's so easy for us to see what's real and true
*  if it's someone else, right?
*  If you ask someone, what do you think of someone
*  who's 10, 11 years old,
*  who's abused and manipulated and abused by an adult?
*  We say, oh my goodness,
*  I feel compassion for that person, right?
*  But if it's us, right?
*  Then, oh no, it's guilt and shame
*  and we have to hide it away.
*  And when the person starts looking at it,
*  they can sort of see it from the outside
*  and it starts to take the energy out of it, right?
*  Then, well, who should feel guilty about that?
*  Who's done something wrong?
*  And like, so now the conceptions come together,
*  which is often a reflexive, that was my fault.
*  Oh, I did it, I went back to it.
*  I still stayed on the team.
*  I went back next season, right?
*  I let it happen again.
*  All the guilt and shame inside the person
*  gets juxtaposed to like, what really happened there?
*  And then they say, right, I was a terrified child, right?
*  I didn't understand it all.
*  And they can come to a place of compassion
*  and now we are working against the guilt and shame.
*  And if the person cries about it, that's great, right?
*  Crying is one of the best coping mechanisms we have.
*  It doesn't hurt us and it lets us grieve things.
*  We can't grieve if there's guilt and shame inside us.
*  It just blocks grief, right?
*  We have to, it has to be a clean slate, in a sense,
*  in order to feel sadness.
*  And then you see that it shifts from anxiety,
*  anger and frustration, usually directed towards the self,
*  guilt and shame, towards being able to process it
*  and being able to bring to bear some compassion
*  and being able to direct the negative emotions,
*  so to speak, where they're warranted.
*  And my goodness, the changes that happen.
*  I mean, it's not like people are miraculously cured, right?
*  But it's remarkable how just getting it out there
*  and having like one hour of talking like that,
*  like what we're talking about now,
*  can leave a person feeling immensely better.
*  It seems to me in hearing this,
*  that there's this weird wiring that we have.
*  The thing is, when traumas happen to us or we observe them,
*  what we need to do most is to confront those
*  and the emotions around that directly.
*  But instead our system defaults to guilt, shame
*  and trying to hide it.
*  And this repetition compulsion of placing us back
*  into things similar to those traumas,
*  or even maybe even worse traumas,
*  in an attempt to resolve it.
*  It's like the most maladaptive wiring diagram
*  I could possibly think of.
*  Emotional and presumably physiological wiring diagram.
*  And this notion of trying to change the past
*  by doing things now when the exact opposite
*  is what's going to be beneficial.
*  Also seems like the whole system seems completely backwards.
*  And I'm chuckling as I say this,
*  not because I'm amused,
*  it's because I'm just baffled once again
*  at how our wiring can often not serve us well.
*  But it raises what I think is an important
*  and interesting question, which is earlier,
*  you were talking about how people will seek out media
*  that's really disturbing.
*  They'll traumatize and re-traumatize themselves
*  on a daily basis.
*  So that could be viewed as the repetition compulsion,
*  or the person will have the same relationship
*  with seven different, same abusive relationship
*  with seven different partners in sequence.
*  Seems terrible.
*  And yet, as I say this, it also is becoming clear to me
*  how this almost seems like a poor
*  but desperate attempt to resolve it in some way.
*  And so the fork in the road, if I understand correctly,
*  is to really get to the seed incident,
*  really get to the thing that started it all,
*  as opposed to repeating it all.
*  Does that have to be done in the presence of a therapist?
*  Is there a benefit to taking a walk
*  and thinking about these things,
*  breaking down and crying if that's what's necessary,
*  or feeling angrier if that's what comes up?
*  The reason I ask it this way is because I worry,
*  I'll just speak to my own experience,
*  I worry that in reactivating
*  or touching into the emotions around something,
*  that that is itself a form of the repetition compulsion,
*  because you're feeling it all over again.
*  You're not seeking out something to evoke that feeling.
*  So I realize this is a little bit of a circular argument
*  or question, but I think it's one that I really struggle with
*  in trying to parse all the outcome-based therapies
*  that I hear about and the recommendations that people make.
*  I mean, how should we conceptualize this?
*  Something happens, sounds like we need to deal
*  with that thing directly.
*  Do we need to do that with somebody else?
*  Can we do that on our own?
*  If we don't have resources
*  and we have to do it on our own,
*  can't hire someone, can't pay someone to work with us,
*  how do we do that in a way that isn't retraumatizing
*  ourself in a major way or in a minor way?
*  How do we know where we are in that landscape?
*  Right, again, those are, I think, great questions.
*  And I think it starts with real introspection.
*  When things are bouncing around in our minds,
*  often it's very non-productive, right?
*  It's the same thing over and over again.
*  That's not helpful for us, right?
*  So there's an idea which sometimes gets called
*  an observing ego, right?
*  The ability to stop and look at what's going on
*  inside of ourselves.
*  And so if we're just thinking about it
*  and we're thinking in the same way we sort of,
*  in a sense, always think about it,
*  then all we're doing is reinforcing the trauma, right?
*  But if we can distance enough to be like,
*  huh, I'm interested in what's going on inside of me, right?
*  Like I think of a certain person who really loves music
*  and then at some point in our therapy work,
*  I learned she was taking long drives,
*  but the radio wasn't on.
*  And I was like, well, what's going on?
*  And I asked and what was going on is she was running
*  over and over again in her head like, I'm a loser.
*  I'm a loser, right?
*  And she didn't want the music on
*  because the music would drown out
*  what she felt she had to say to herself, right?
*  And it was that like, wow, that's interesting, right?
*  And then her ability to observe that
*  and to think, why am I doing that
*  when it comes into her mind?
*  Like, what does that trace to?
*  When did I start doing that?
*  Like I say, I'm saying it for a point of exaggeration,
*  like nobody comes out of the womb,
*  programmed to think I'm a loser, right?
*  So we don't think that when we're born, right?
*  So where does that come from?
*  Then we can think in ways that allow us
*  to have new thoughts, right?
*  That we weren't having,
*  it's not just bouncing around in our minds.
*  And if we speak or write, there are even more mechanisms
*  that come online in our brains, right?
*  That are then sort of monitoring mechanisms.
*  We think in a different way if we're using words, right?
*  And we are better able often
*  to bring in that observing ego,
*  like what's going on inside of me?
*  So it can be very helpful to think,
*  it can be helpful to talk to someone, to a trusted other,
*  friend, family, clergy, to write.
*  I mean, these are things that can be done
*  without expending any resources, right?
*  And sometimes it can make really a big difference, right?
*  It was a wait, when did I start thinking that?
*  And like, interestingly in this case,
*  okay, we did it in therapy,
*  but it became very clear what that was rooted to, right?
*  And then in the therapy, which was still relatively young,
*  but we'd done several sessions
*  and we weren't talking at all
*  about what we needed to talk about, right?
*  But that's what got us to what we needed to talk about.
*  And when did that start?
*  And now we're in that same place of exploring that
*  and what was the reflex to it
*  and the sense of guilt and sense of shame.
*  And it's where all of that came from,
*  that just got boiled down to I'm a loser, right?
*  Which this person didn't even have in their mind,
*  like I didn't think about myself that way, right?
*  And it's so interesting, right?
*  That our memories don't in and of themselves have meaning.
*  It's like they're flat or colorless, right?
*  And they're colored in by the emotions
*  that we attach to them, right?
*  So the idea that certain memories now before the trauma
*  were changed, right, by the trauma.
*  So I tell the story sometimes of a person
*  who won an award when they were in high school
*  that they thought was, oh my gosh,
*  it shows, I can do it, right?
*  I can get out there.
*  That after trauma, they saw the award
*  with a negative emotion attached to it
*  that was like, oh, it was given to me
*  and I didn't deserve it.
*  And almost it was mocking.
*  There's gonna be the greatest achievement in my life
*  and I was 17 or so.
*  And to have someone think,
*  that's not how they felt about that at the time.
*  It's the trauma that changed the self-talk,
*  the internal state going forward.
*  And talking about miraculous in a negative way,
*  also changed that going backward, right?
*  And when we can really look at it,
*  like where did that come from?
*  And we can start unraveling it, it changes.
*  So in those cases, often it's helpful
*  to have a good therapist.
*  It's not always necessary
*  and it's certainly, it's not always possible, right?
*  So we need other strategies.
*  And some of those, I write about some of those in the book
*  of how can we sort of get at trauma
*  without those formalized mechanisms.
*  And sometimes if the symptoms are significant enough,
*  like we really do need to talk to somebody professional
*  who can help us get to the root of the trauma.
*  And there's so many times that's the answer
*  to what's going on with people.
*  People I've seen have had five residential stays.
*  I'm not exaggerating this.
*  For mental health reasons, for substance reasons,
*  and no one's ever taken a trauma history.
*  And then when you take a trauma history,
*  you say, well, that's obviously
*  where this is all coming from, right?
*  Like that's when the drug use started truly thereafter,
*  the negative self-talk and the negative feelings
*  that led to the drug use.
*  Then you go after the trauma and you can change things.
*  Whereas trying to change things without looking,
*  introspecting, talking about the trauma,
*  I think of course was futile.
*  Do you think that people can start
*  to have negative fantasies?
*  I mean, you mentioned this woman
*  who would take these long drives to berate herself.
*  I'm not familiar with that,
*  but I'll give a little bit of personal disclosure here.
*  I've felt several times in my life
*  that I will start to create a narrative
*  about something that truly hasn't happened,
*  about something terrible that somebody is going to do
*  that's going to upset me.
*  And for the longest time, I would wonder,
*  why am I doing this?
*  And I have a couple ideas about why.
*  One is that I was attempting to just avoid thinking
*  about other things.
*  It's just, you know, anger is such
*  an attractive emotional force.
*  And in a sense, it's an attractant.
*  It's not attractive.
*  We don't like it.
*  And yet oftentimes anger is a great way
*  to replace feeling something else.
*  Feeling sad or having to come up or to do work
*  or to do something useful.
*  So it has this kind of like gravitational force to it.
*  That was one idea.
*  The other idea was in imagining kind of worst outcomes,
*  then actually that relationship
*  could actually seem a lot better in reality.
*  It's almost like creating this negative contrast.
*  It's like, oh, well then it's not that bad.
*  And then the third possibility is I have no idea why,
*  but it seemed like a reflex
*  and I had spent some time thinking about it.
*  I can't say I've resolved it completely,
*  but why would somebody have a narrative
*  or a default narrative when driving or when walking of,
*  I'm just gonna spend some time
*  and think about how terrible this thing is gonna turn out
*  or how someone's gonna upset me or harm me
*  or how terrible I am.
*  It seems again, like maladaptive thinking,
*  maladaptive wiring, and yet I have to assume
*  that it serves some purpose.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I mean, I think there are three factors there
*  and they're all bad.
*  And I think you spoke to at least two of them.
*  They may, I think, speak so powerfully
*  to how insidious trauma is
*  and how these are real brain changes inside of us.
*  So I would say the three factors,
*  punishment, avoidance, and control.
*  So the trauma inside of us that makes guilt and shame
*  so often, so often leads to a desire to punish oneself.
*  And the idea that, oh, that was my fault or I deserve that.
*  Well, what do we do if something is someone's fault
*  and someone now deserves punishment?
*  I mean, we punish them.
*  We send them to jail, we give them a fine.
*  We punish them.
*  And so what we do is punish ourselves.
*  And if we tell ourselves we're a loser
*  or this awful thing is gonna happen,
*  then part of what we're doing is saying to ourselves,
*  see, you deserve that.
*  You're not gonna have anything better.
*  It's a negative, it's a very negative way
*  that the brain tries to make us, in a sense, do better
*  by hurting us more for the things that we couldn't
*  and shouldn't have been able to, weren't expected
*  to be to control in the first place.
*  The second is distraction.
*  As you said, anger, that kind of fantasy
*  can distract us from affect, feeling, and emotion
*  that can be much more negative.
*  Anger, it can be more gratifying
*  than certainly than guilt or shame.
*  Although guilt and shame can serve a punishment purpose.
*  But if anger is directed also towards ourselves,
*  then it can serve punishment too.
*  So punishment, avoidance, and the sense of control.
*  If you think ahead to something awful
*  that you're imagining is going to happen,
*  well, maybe that will let you avoid it.
*  I mean, you can see the brain here,
*  in a sense, really confused.
*  I mean, part of the brain wants to punish.
*  Part of the brain doesn't wanna think about it at all.
*  And part of the brain wants to make it better.
*  And then how all of that resolves,
*  if we're not aware that, hey,
*  this is in the context of our brains
*  being deeply impacted by trauma.
*  So what's going on here is all maladaptive, right?
*  Because these negative fantasies of the future,
*  they may help us feel better
*  about something in the present,
*  but they don't help us make anything better, right?
*  They don't help us make anything better.
*  So this is the kind of the sequelae.
*  This is where trauma and all this reflexive stuff
*  that happens after trauma ultimately lead us.
*  And you can see how we get lost,
*  how I've seen over and over again in my own life,
*  in the lives of other people,
*  how, man, we get stuck in those situations.
*  And that's why I see people sometimes,
*  this has been going on for 30 years, 40 years, right?
*  And it's just been going on over and over and over again,
*  because there's no natural end to any of this, right?
*  Unless we look at it in a different way
*  that we've knowledge and information like, whoa,
*  this isn't the way it has to be.
*  Let me bring a novel perspective to this.
*  It doesn't change on its own.
*  I'm struck by your statement that these thoughts
*  or behaviors can make us feel better,
*  but they don't actually make anything better.
*  In that way, this mode of imagining terrible outcomes
*  starts to immediately seem like taking opioids.
*  You feel better in the moment,
*  but it doesn't actually make anything better,
*  and it probably makes things worse.
*  Yes.
*  And just as a question of how much worse
*  and in what direction.
*  Yes.
*  And so I just wanna just pause on that concept,
*  because I think that concept makes us feel better,
*  but doesn't make anything better.
*  I think it answers an earlier question
*  about what seems to be a totally maladaptive wiring diagram.
*  We need to confront the thing,
*  but we don't wanna go into the repetition compulsion.
*  There's a knife edge there to navigate through trauma.
*  Yes.
*  Working with a very skilled clinician like yourself,
*  I think is the ideal circumstance for people.
*  And of course, there are people who can't access support
*  from somebody for whatever reason.
*  You've talked about journaling as a useful tool.
*  Maybe you highlight some of the other things
*  that people can do on their own,
*  and then I'd also like to talk about
*  what makes for a good therapist.
*  What should people look for
*  for those that are seeking therapy,
*  especially nowadays when a lot of therapy
*  is being done remotely.
*  But let's just start with the,
*  let's just call them self-generated or zero cost
*  sorts of things.
*  Journaling being the first,
*  and then what are some of the others?
*  And what kind of structure would you recommend
*  someone put around journaling?
*  Carry a journal around all day
*  and jot things down as they come up,
*  or sit down and spend an hour writing
*  in complete sentences, for instance.
*  Yeah, if I could add something to what you had just said
*  before the question,
*  that we have these short-term coping mechanisms in us.
*  And in a way, it makes sense.
*  We find ourselves in just terrible situations,
*  then a short-term coping mechanism
*  can get us through them.
*  So our brains are built that way,
*  and that's part of survival too.
*  And whether now in the modern world,
*  whether it's food, it's drugs, it's sex,
*  it's alcohol, right?
*  Or it's negative thoughts, right?
*  This is short-term soothing.
*  Even the negative thoughts and anger is short-term soothing
*  at the expense of long-term change, right?
*  And that's where addictive pathways can come into play.
*  And that's where again,
*  how we're built evolutionarily for survival
*  doesn't help us in the way humans have evolved.
*  We haven't lived this way throughout 99.9% of human history,
*  so we're not adapted to this.
*  So I want to just make a point of saying that
*  about the short-term soothing
*  at the expense of long-term change.
*  And then the question you had asked about,
*  say journaling or what can we do
*  that's outside of a professional,
*  I think the hallmark of it
*  has to be bringing new eyes to it, right?
*  Like thinking about self with a curiosity
*  instead of just a simple automaticity or repetition, right?
*  Like, why am I thinking about this?
*  When did this start?
*  Why is this in me?
*  It's that, whether it's words or whether we're writing,
*  that's so important.
*  So I think for journaling, it depends on the person.
*  I mean, we don't want somebody carrying around a journal
*  all day if then there's a compulsion
*  to I need to write about everything
*  that's going on in my mind, right?
*  Like that might be good to,
*  okay, write a little bit at night, right?
*  Or someone who might think,
*  sometimes this really comes into my mind in a strong way
*  and it could be unpredictable, right?
*  I want to have the journal with me.
*  So, ah, that thing is back in my mind now.
*  Let me write about it, right?
*  Because then putting words to it
*  and then being able to read those words, right?
*  And when people read, even do a little bit of journaling
*  and they read like, oh, I thought again
*  about how I'm a terrible person who can't have a good life
*  because I was in such a bad car accident
*  or because that person attacked me
*  or because when I was in school,
*  I was bullied because I looked different than everyone else,
*  right?
*  Or I acted different for everyone else.
*  Wow, you know, to actually see that written out,
*  it's, you know, it's a little bit of that,
*  it's a little bit of that,
*  like when you're saying it to someone
*  as if it were someone else, right?
*  Because now there's enough distance from it.
*  Like I'm looking at the words I wrote, right?
*  That we get some distance and we can start to integrate
*  some of the, not just the compassion,
*  but integrating compassion and logic, right?
*  Of like, okay, I feel a sense of compassion.
*  I'm like, what does this mean?
*  What really happened here, right?
*  And gosh, I did start thinking differently after that.
*  I started to, that's where this came from, right?
*  That's why I'm saying this.
*  It's those kinds of revelations that we can have
*  through again, the written or spoken word.
*  And I think again, that involves a trusted other,
*  or writing.
*  And I think that those are ways we can do this
*  where we bring some de novo perspective
*  to something that often has been bouncing around
*  inside of us.
*  And it's amazing to me that I can see such
*  intelligent and pathically attuned people
*  who've had the same thing running over and over again
*  in their mind for years.
*  And it just points out that our brains
*  don't automatically say, hey, wait a second, you know,
*  I've been spinning wheels here for a long, long time.
*  Like, was there another way to look at this?
*  We need something from the outside
*  which can just be knowledge, right?
*  Which is why I think what we're doing here,
*  or the reason I wrote the book that I wrote
*  was like apprehending this like amazing surprise to me,
*  right?
*  Which is like, wow, some huge percentage of everything
*  I'm treating is rooted in trauma and the opacity of trauma,
*  right?
*  Which is why we don't see that, oh, the depression,
*  the panic attacks, the life change, the addiction,
*  the maladaptive choices, like, oh, this is all coming
*  from trauma because it hides itself in that opacity.
*  So we need a de novo perspective
*  if we're doing it on our own.
*  And we need that if we're doing it in therapy,
*  which might link to like finding the right therapist, right?
*  Which is also part of your question.
*  Yeah, I definitely wanna know about how to assess
*  and find the right therapist.
*  Before we cover that, however, something came up
*  in the course of your answer.
*  I can immediately relate to this idea that, you know,
*  certain behaviors are really maladaptive
*  and are stuffing things down or avoiding the topic
*  is problematic and bringing a curiosity
*  and an introspection and almost a third personing
*  of the experience that we've had in order to try
*  and address it truly from a new perspective.
*  It occurred to me as we were discussing this, however,
*  that some people, and yes, maybe I'm talking a little bit
*  about my own experience, we have a sense of our own identity
*  and how people view us and our ability to be functional
*  in the world in ways that we like.
*  Effective at work or a good brother or a good mother
*  or father, human being in the world, we have relationships.
*  And I think that one thing that I have heard
*  and maybe I've experienced is that sometimes
*  those maladaptive thoughts or behaviors,
*  the things that generate a kind of a repetition of anger
*  or of arousal or activation or sadness,
*  that we have some internal process where we funnel that
*  into a functionality in the world.
*  So I'll give a more concrete example.
*  So in thinking about things that have upset me in the past
*  and in imagining bad outcomes in the future,
*  there's a certain internal state of arousal that comes about.
*  And for many years, I was able to use that,
*  not to feel angry, but rather to work an extra three hours a
*  day or to pack my schedule with work and social engagement
*  so I could show up in a way that I, you know,
*  hopefully was a very good brother to my sister, for instance.
*  So in a way, it was a transformation of something negative
*  inside of me into a functionality in the world
*  that was actually very rewarding and beneficial.
*  And yet in describing it, I can immediately see how
*  it would be wonderful if I could source from something else.
*  And yet I, you can imagine, and I can imagine how one would
*  be reluctant, maybe even terrified of giving up that source.
*  It's a fuel.
*  And I think in knowing some of the traumas of other people
*  and their reluctance to work through those,
*  obviously I'm not a therapist, I sense this over and over
*  again, that one's positive identity can often be linked
*  to something difficult in their past.
*  And so people are reluctant to give up this fuel
*  because in that sense, it's functional.
*  The only thing that allowed me to kind of start to address
*  this and why I'm still so curious about this,
*  because I don't think I've worked through this process
*  completely, again, a little more self-disclosure there,
*  is that I was told that these words,
*  just imagine how much better it would be if you could source
*  from a different fuel, a fuel that felt better.
*  Maybe it was on this sentence, it was maybe you could
*  actually be much more effective.
*  Maybe you could be 10 times the better brother.
*  Maybe you could have 10 times more insider work capacity,
*  et cetera.
*  So it's on that hint of a promise that at least I was
*  inspired to start looking into these things and reading
*  about trauma in your book and elsewhere and start to think
*  about this.
*  So again, I realize this is a long-winded question
*  and a somewhat complex idea, but I think, or I hope that
*  people will be able to resonate with this idea that sometimes
*  we want to stay attached to this short-term soothing,
*  that the punishment, distraction or control,
*  because it evokes this arousal and then we can apply
*  that arousal.
*  Yes, yes.
*  I think what you're describing maps, I think clinically
*  to what gets called sublimation.
*  So there's something negative inside of us,
*  but we sort of transfer that energy.
*  We transfer that into something that is adaptive or that is
*  positive.
*  So the idea of anger, right?
*  When I think of that thing and it makes anger in me,
*  I channel that into harder work, right?
*  Or I channel that into like, I'm going to go be nicer
*  to my brother, something like that.
*  And there's validity to that, right?
*  But it can become like self-justifying if a person
*  thinks, well, look at what this is doing for me, right?
*  That wouldn't work as hard without it, right?
*  Now we start to become attached to the trauma,
*  whereas I think what you had said is absolutely true,
*  that just because we can sublimate some of the negative
*  affect feeling emotion that comes from trauma
*  into something productive, doesn't mean that that's best.
*  Right?
*  We know we can get to our destination by taking
*  a very circuitous route, right?
*  We might waste an hour getting there, but we get there.
*  That doesn't mean that that's best.
*  And it also doesn't look at all the negative, right?
*  In this example, the wasted fuel, the wasted time, right?
*  We get somewhere, but we are not optimizing.
*  And I have yet to see one person who has addressed
*  the trauma and become less functional, right?
*  It's always either they're just as functional,
*  but they're happier, right?
*  Or more functional, because as you said,
*  like just because we may be able to sublimate,
*  so maybe what's going on would be 10 times better, right?
*  If we weren't sublimating,
*  because the sublimation limits us, right?
*  It limits our perspective to only what we can see and do
*  through the lens of the trauma.
*  And that is never better than the alternative.
*  Thank you for that.
*  Yeah, you're welcome.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's discuss how one could or should go about finding
*  a really good therapist.
*  Typically, in my experience, this is done by word of mouth.
*  There's this person you might wanna work with them,
*  they're really great.
*  But what are some of the characteristics
*  that one should look for?
*  And should we take into account whether or not
*  we are a person who, for instance,
*  I've heard this from listeners,
*  although I'm definitely not talking about myself here
*  in cloaking something.
*  Some people will say,
*  I wanna work with a somatic therapist,
*  because I've actually heard someone say,
*  I think in feels, I feel stuff in my body,
*  so I wanna work with someone who can really acknowledge that.
*  Or someone else will say,
*  I wanna work with somebody who has this orientation
*  or that orientation or is open to my particular lifestyle
*  or isn't gonna tell me that I have to leave my relationship.
*  I feel like people already show up to the question
*  of who to work with, with all these things internally,
*  some of which are voiced and some of which aren't.
*  So I'd love for you to talk about that.
*  I'd love for you to talk about maybe some of the
*  core features of a really good therapist
*  and then how to look for a therapist
*  and also how to think about oneself
*  in looking for a therapist
*  because of these kind of predispositions.
*  Right, right.
*  Well, there's a lot of data about this over the years
*  that if you look at what are the top 10 important factors
*  to find in a therapist,
*  just repeat rapport 10 times, right?
*  I mean, that's the key.
*  If you think about that, it's pretty amazing, right?
*  Because therapeutic modalities can be so different, right?
*  And I think what that's telling us is,
*  in a way, something very obvious, right?
*  Like, what does rapport mean?
*  Like, you know, somebody's paying attention, right?
*  It's trust, it's a back and forth.
*  It's like, yeah, even though I'm doing something difficult,
*  I'm doing it with someone who's really helping me.
*  Someone who's in it with me, right?
*  Someone who's really paying attention,
*  wants me to be better.
*  That's indispensable.
*  I mean, it's just indispensable.
*  I write in the book,
*  if someone, a therapist is not making eye contact,
*  or this is the way they do it, right?
*  And you know, you gotta fit into the box
*  of the way they do it.
*  That is not going to be helpful.
*  And then what I think about that is
*  the different modalities,
*  it doesn't actually tell us that,
*  oh, the modality is irrelevant.
*  I think that's not true.
*  I think that good therapists are not pigeonholed
*  by a certain modality.
*  They may come at the world largely through a psychodynamic,
*  or a CBT, or a DBT lens,
*  there's lots of different ways to do therapy.
*  But when you really talk to those people,
*  really good experienced therapists,
*  it's all coming through the vehicle of the rapport,
*  but they're practically shifting to what the person needs.
*  I don't understand the idea that like,
*  oh, I just do this, right?
*  I don't do that.
*  And when people are pigeonholed that way,
*  I don't think they help their patients very well, right?
*  We have to be diverse enough to say,
*  yeah, I want all the arrows in the quiver, right?
*  And even though there might be one that I favor
*  and that's the lens I see things through,
*  no, I can be versatile, I can shift,
*  I can adapt to what this person needs.
*  And I think if you have that,
*  you've got a winning combination.
*  Great, so people should perhaps try a few therapists
*  and maybe have a session or two or three
*  to see if the rapport feels like it's taking root.
*  Is that, do you have that right?
*  Yeah, and I think that's why word of mouth is important, right?
*  If someone you trust tells you,
*  hey, this is a good person, that says a lot, right?
*  It already makes the pre-test probability is quite high.
*  But yes, it's interesting to see when people
*  have a therapist or they call their insurance
*  and they're assigned a therapist,
*  this thought that like,
*  oh, that's the person I have to have now.
*  And it's like, no, you should look at that like anyone,
*  you would be interviewing, right?
*  For a job, right?
*  But you got to bring again the right set of thoughts
*  to that to be helped, right?
*  Which is like, I want someone who has rapport with me.
*  I don't want someone who's gonna make it easy, right?
*  Who's like, well, it's gosh, it's kind of pleasant
*  because then that means they're not talking
*  about the difficult things, right?
*  So if one brings like, I know this isn't gonna be easy,
*  I got to talk about difficult things, right?
*  Even if one doesn't recognize,
*  I got to talk about the trauma in me, right?
*  But to go to therapy thinking,
*  no, it's, I mean, sometimes it's enjoyable,
*  but a lot of times, right, it's not, right?
*  It's hard work, it can be excruciating,
*  we can cry during it.
*  But to say, right, that that's how I'm gonna be helped
*  and I want someone who's gonna do that with me, you know,
*  who's really looking at what's going on inside of me,
*  how do we help me?
*  And I can feel sort of the robustness of that.
*  If one brings that approach
*  and then looks at the therapist through that lens,
*  you're very likely to then move on from someone
*  who's not a good choice, right?
*  And really stick with someone who is,
*  even though that doesn't mean it's always pleasant
*  and enjoyable, I mean, it has to not be that sometimes.
*  Right.
*  Well, maybe we could drill a little deeper
*  into the mechanics of therapy.
*  I put out a few questions to audience
*  asking what they want to know about therapy.
*  And it was amazing, I got hundreds, if not thousands,
*  of responses saying, how should I show up to therapy?
*  So for instance, should people take a five minute
*  meditative drop in before,
*  or should they just show up cold and let it emerge?
*  During therapy, is it a good idea to take notes
*  or to not take notes?
*  And then post therapy, how should clients, patients,
*  as they're sometimes called one or the other,
*  I never know which, how should they process that information?
*  Should they take some designated time afterwards
*  and in an ideal world, take a 30 minute walk afterwards
*  and think about the material,
*  or should they set it aside and come back to it?
*  Of course there are constraints, work and family, et cetera.
*  But there's a lot of knowledge out there
*  about how to best show up to a workout,
*  warm up for five, 10 minutes, then do this, et cetera,
*  and then the cool down.
*  I mean, here we're talking about hard psychological work
*  aimed at bettering oneself.
*  So to my knowledge, I've not ever seen this information
*  anywhere, it'd be very useful to hear your thoughts on this.
*  Yeah, well I'm not trying to duck the question,
*  but I think it varies so much by person.
*  So if you think about the first part of your question,
*  I think was how to show up to therapy, right?
*  And I think the answer would be,
*  whatever lets you be fully present
*  when you're in therapy.
*  Now for some people, it's gonna be, I show up early,
*  I sit, I calm myself, I meditate a little bit.
*  I mean, that's how then they're present, right?
*  For other people, they just show up, walk into the room,
*  they can stop another present, right?
*  So whatever works for that person
*  so that they're really there, their thoughts,
*  their energy is really in what's going on.
*  And the same thing applies on the other end.
*  Now there are people who are really well served
*  by going for a walk if they can,
*  or sitting quietly after therapy,
*  and then kind of putting that in order, right?
*  Otherwise they lose some of it, right?
*  Or like some of the ah-has, right?
*  Or the thought, oh, that's an interesting thought
*  that they really need to put it in order.
*  Maybe that involves taking some notes during therapy, right?
*  For other people, they need to do the exact opposite.
*  They need to like leave, not think about that at all,
*  and then they can reflect on it later and learn from it.
*  So we're so different.
*  Human beings, there's such a diversity in us
*  that I think there's no hard answer to that.
*  And then the other thing is,
*  even in the conversation,
*  it's a much more present, when it's happening,
*  than being able to sort of consolidate and retain
*  what's been gained is most important,
*  and I think we have to figure that out person by person.
*  I mean, I try and do that in the work of like,
*  what's serving this person best?
*  And sometimes we, sometimes it evolves,
*  and sometimes we talk about it, but it varies so much.
*  general issues of life, what is the frequency
*  that you recommend?
*  I could imagine two extreme models.
*  One is, okay, I'm gonna finally tackle this trauma.
*  I'm going to do therapy three times a week,
*  but for a shorter period of time,
*  six months over and out versus this open-ended model
*  of once a week typically for as long as it takes.
*  Right, right.
*  I think that also varies.
*  And I work with people in varied ways
*  from someone who's doing well
*  and like we meet for a half hour every six months, right,
*  to doing week-long hourly sessions,
*  to spending three intense days with someone in a row, right?
*  So I think as far as like kind of guiding principles,
*  what I have found in my own life,
*  because I value my own therapy tremendously.
*  So I found in my own life and in my own clinical work
*  that if it's less than once a week,
*  then it's hard for us to retain really.
*  We spend a lot of time kind of catching up,
*  okay, what's happened?
*  Let's get back to the place we were at before, right?
*  Which is why I think if we're really gonna get somewhere,
*  we're not just trying to maintain something, right?
*  Then I think once a week for an hour
*  is really kind of the minimum, right?
*  But more intensive work, it's like the more intense it is,
*  it's not linear, right?
*  It's an exponential gain.
*  Like we do a lot of intensive work, right?
*  Where someone will come and do 30 clinical hours with us
*  over the course of a week.
*  So five or six different clinicians, 30 clinical hours,
*  and we've found that the benefits of doing that are immense.
*  It's like I say a year's worth of therapy consolidated.
*  And you think, well, 30 hours, let's say,
*  we go almost every week, maybe that's 45 or 50 hours,
*  but 30 hours with that kind of intensity
*  is worth probably 60 hours done in a different way
*  because then it's in us in an active way, right?
*  It's in the therapist in an active way.
*  It becomes very, very dynamic.
*  So I think turning up the intensity,
*  if there's something that we really need to process,
*  absolutely makes sense.
*  And I do that in my own life.
*  There's something now it's like, whoa,
*  something is really distressing me
*  and it's linking into prior trauma.
*  And I can see what's going on in me.
*  And I start to have ruminative thoughts with negativity.
*  I'm like, I gotta go more, right?
*  Because I gotta do that processing
*  so I can get to the place that I am,
*  which is not that the trauma has no impact on me, right?
*  It's that the impact is much less
*  than it was before the therapy.
*  And that I most often, more often than not,
*  have an ability to see when it's now intruding
*  into my thoughts and it's taking me away
*  from what I really think and believe
*  or being able to draw logic and emotion together
*  and make good decisions.
*  Turning up the intensity then absolutely makes sense.
*  This very deep intensive work of 30 hours in a week,
*  what brings somebody to the type of work of that sort?
*  Is it a suicide risk or a severe addiction situation?
*  I mean, how does one gauge how much therapy
*  they ought to be doing?
*  And should it always be on the therapist
*  to decide that frequency?
*  What would bring someone to a situation
*  of five therapists in 30 hours a week in one week?
*  Right, right.
*  It's usually a person who is really distressed by something,
*  whether it's so negatively impacting their life
*  or sometimes a person comes to a realization,
*  I just can't take this anymore, right?
*  Or I'm sick of this cyclical depression
*  and I gotta stop having panic attacks.
*  I need help, right?
*  But it's usually some crisis point
*  with the idea of crisis and the meaning of,
*  okay, something comes to a head
*  and after it things are gonna be different, right?
*  Not a crisis and things are gonna be negative afterwards,
*  but a point where then that cognitive flexibility
*  comes to the fore of like,
*  well, I need to do something different, right?
*  So that's often what brings us,
*  sometimes it's other people pointing it out
*  or somebody's had an intervention somewhere
*  or yes, that person's been hospitalized
*  after a suicide attempt
*  or they've gone back to rehab again
*  for the third or fourth time
*  and their life is really in danger.
*  Sometimes it's that and sometimes it's a person realizing,
*  yeah, I just wanna look at myself,
*  wanna understand myself better.
*  I know that what's going on in me
*  isn't as good as it can be, right?
*  So I think people can come to it
*  for all sorts of different ways.
*  And I think, yes, I think a lot of times
*  it would be the therapist to say it looks more work,
*  more intensive work or can make a difference.
*  But I think the person also needs to,
*  take ownership of their own therapy
*  and say, if I don't feel helped enough,
*  well, I have to think about that, right?
*  And talk to the therapist about that
*  because maybe that therapist isn't a match, right?
*  Or maybe you talk to the therapist
*  and the therapist can change his or her approach, right?
*  Or maybe you talk to the therapist
*  and increase the frequency, right?
*  But the idea is to be aware of it, right?
*  And if one's needs aren't being met to acknowledge that, right?
*  Because people can get into a rhythm of therapy
*  where it's really not helping them, right?
*  But they either feel sort of nihilistic about it,
*  like, oh, I'm no better and I'm going to therapy, right?
*  Or sometimes there's a sense that while I'm in therapy,
*  so I'm kind of checking that box
*  of doing something for myself,
*  but it's not really getting me anywhere.
*  And then the part of the brain
*  that's controlled by the guilt and shame and avoidance
*  thinks that's a great idea, right?
*  So again, this ability to observe ourselves
*  and like, what's going on?
*  Am I being helped in the way I, do I feel helped, right?
*  Am I in some ways even like happy that I'm not feeling helped
*  because I don't have to face this thing
*  I don't want to face, right?
*  Or am I too afraid to say I need more help, right?
*  Do we really need to look at ourselves?
*  And this is where the insurance systems
*  often are very difficult
*  because it's hard sometimes for a person to say,
*  I need more therapy because that may not be possible, right?
*  So there are sort of negative factors in the world around us,
*  but ultimately I think the answer to the question
*  comes down to observing ourselves and taking ownership
*  of like what's going on in us and how we're feeling
*  and then feeling that commitment to self
*  or to self care to say, I need to go change this.
*  And for those that maybe don't have the means
*  or insurance or access to do even one day a week therapy
*  in the journaling model,
*  could one perhaps take an entire day
*  as awful as it might seem to do a lot of journaling
*  and thinking and walking,
*  to a self-generated intensive,
*  do you think there's utility to that?
*  I mean, there could be, but again, it depends by person
*  because there could also be something negative about that
*  if it's someone who's not at the point,
*  not ready for that, right?
*  I mean, we don't come directly at the trauma immediately,
*  at least most of the time we don't do that, right?
*  And we often don't explore it in depth.
*  Like this idea that, oh, that person now has to go
*  through every second of the trauma is actually not true.
*  Sometimes it is, but that's not the common situation.
*  More often that person has to acknowledge,
*  the example of like, I was sexually abused
*  and have to acknowledge that and say,
*  okay, like, gosh, what has that done to me?
*  That doesn't mean, well, let's parse out every moment
*  of like how that was and the terror of that.
*  So that can lead people to a worse place, right?
*  So I think the idea of biting off small pieces,
*  so to speak, where a person is writing or is talking.
*  But I think if one is writing,
*  it is good to communicate with another, right?
*  Another trusted person.
*  And if there's not someone in one's personal life,
*  you know, they're clergy members,
*  even if one isn't affiliated with an organized religion,
*  you could probably go places
*  and get a clergy to want to help you, right?
*  I mean, there are people out there
*  who want to help other people.
*  So let's say what if someone has no one?
*  I mean, almost never do we have no one here, right?
*  Cause we could probably go find someone,
*  we need to take that in pieces.
*  So there's some risk to trying to do the intensive thing,
*  you know, on one's own.
*  And that's where I would put it.
*  If a person's having suicidal thoughts
*  or even thoughts of death, of not wanting to be alive,
*  I don't deserve to be alive.
*  I mean, these are warning signs for really getting help.
*  So there are some signs that say,
*  hey, don't try and do that on your own, right?
*  Go try and find a resource.
*  And it's, you know, things that get to that level
*  of severity of, and often a person knows that.
*  I mean, am I in a place where I know I'm not healthy
*  and I'm having, you know, kind of scary thoughts,
*  then we need, that's a person who really shouldn't
*  be doing that on their own.
*  Great, thank you for that.
*  You're welcome.
*  So we've been talking a lot about talking.
*  And now I'd like to talk a little bit about chemistry.
*  Yes.
*  Drugs.
*  So maybe first we could talk prescription drugs.
*  I mean, you're a psychiatrist, so you're approved to,
*  and presumably do prescribe medication
*  where appropriate.
*  And this is a vast landscape, of course.
*  We've got ADHD.
*  And I should just tell you, I get more questions about ADHD
*  and the drugs related to ADHD and dopamine
*  than any other topic.
*  Any other topic.
*  So there's ADHD, there's OCD, there's depression,
*  there's antidepressants and so forth.
*  Is there some way that we can, you know,
*  wrap our arms around all of that
*  as a way of wading into this drug question
*  and just address, you know,
*  how does one decide when medication is useful?
*  Because in the end, the dissection tool
*  that the psychiatrist or therapist has is language.
*  And at some point, one has to make an assessment
*  about dopamine or serotonin or whether or not
*  a given drug would help.
*  And most therapies, I believe, don't involve
*  putting someone in a brain scanner.
*  And to my knowledge, there still is not a very good
*  blood test to assess, oh, is this person's dopamine
*  low or high?
*  Correct me if I'm wrong.
*  And ultimately that, and I know there are companies out there,
*  so I'm not trying to undermine those companies.
*  But if I happen to do that in this statement,
*  if you take a blood test and find that your serotonin
*  metabolites are low, my understanding is it's possible
*  that you are too low in serotonin in the brain,
*  but that's a very indirect window into what's really going on.
*  So how do you think about prescription drugs
*  in the context of treating trauma and other conditions?
*  And then maybe we'll drill into some
*  of the more specific conditions.
*  Sure.
*  I mean, I would first comment that there aren't tests
*  for these things.
*  And I think the tests for metabolites,
*  I mean, things are so different.
*  By the time, what we're talking about has been metabolized
*  often to some very significant extent,
*  left the brain, now it's in the peripheral blood
*  that we really don't learn from that.
*  And I think that we tend to over utilize medicines
*  in this country because we have a healthcare system
*  that often, that's so based on throughput
*  that we want to polish the hood
*  when there's a problem in the engine.
*  So we over utilize medicines often as an endpoint.
*  Oh, we're going to make that person's depression better
*  with an antidepressant.
*  Well, I mean, maybe, but most of the time,
*  it's for that person's depression to really get better
*  and stay better.
*  They need to unravel what's driving the depression.
*  So the first step is, I think there are two steps to it.
*  The first assessment step is, is there a diagnosis
*  that the vast majority of the time,
*  if not sometimes all the time, really warrants a medicine?
*  So bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD,
*  these are diagnoses that we understand more about them
*  and what's going on in the brain
*  and how medicines can treat or stabilize them,
*  which doesn't mean the medicine is necessarily,
*  it's not a substitute for therapy, right?
*  But sometimes the medicine and therapy can go hand in hand.
*  So for OCD, for example, warrants therapy,
*  but it almost, not always,
*  but it almost always warrants medicine too,
*  so that you can ease the systems that are making the rigidity
*  and the repetition in the brain.
*  So the first kind of branch point can be,
*  what is the diagnosis?
*  What is the level of severity?
*  And I think that that's very, very important.
*  Where I think it's a little more, maybe even interesting,
*  is using medicines to help the person engage in the therapy
*  as productively as possible.
*  And here's where I think we're so limited
*  by how we categorize medicines
*  and this sort of pharmaceutical,
*  insurance-driven medical system we have
*  that I think throws us off in tremendous ways.
*  So you think about how medicines are categorized,
*  so antidepressants.
*  And the vast majority of people
*  who are helped by antidepressants,
*  they don't have clinically severe depression, right?
*  Those medicines create more distress tolerance in us.
*  And if you think about how helpful that can be,
*  if you're gonna go,
*  now you're gonna do something difficult,
*  where you're gonna bring that trauma
*  or the stressors to the surface,
*  and you're gonna process it,
*  and you're gonna try and make life change.
*  If we can make more distress tolerance in us,
*  that can be so, so much better.
*  And think about the category of medicines
*  that are called antipsychotics,
*  which really puts people off.
*  But most of the prescriptions for antipsychotics
*  are not for psychosis.
*  And there are ways in which low dosing
*  of some of those medicines can help intervene
*  in negative pathways, in pathways that are about distress.
*  And sending out those tendrils of neurons
*  that are about hypervigilance and avoidance in our brain.
*  And we can often get at that.
*  And if you can improve someone's distress tolerance,
*  and you can use medicines that take away
*  what clinically is rumination, right?
*  Not the standard meaning of that word,
*  but the clinical meaning of it,
*  where there are distress centers in our brain
*  that are overactive,
*  and then we get stuck in these
*  maladaptive negative pathways,
*  where we think about something over and over and over again,
*  with no real chance of solving it,
*  because that's not what's going on inside of us.
*  So medicines can help that,
*  but we have to have some flexibility
*  around their conception.
*  And the modern medical system of 15 minute visits
*  to a psychiatrist that are weeks apart,
*  I don't understand how that goes well, right?
*  In the vast majority of times,
*  I think it doesn't go well,
*  because it's not enough time to do the therapy,
*  to even generate the understanding.
*  So then medicines get thrown at the person.
*  This is how we use,
*  I think approximately five times as much medicine,
*  I think across the board,
*  I say the Dutch population, right?
*  And they go, why is five times more
*  is a lot more medicine, right?
*  And they have a healthcare system and a cultural system
*  that to the best of my understanding
*  is more rooted in taking responsibility for oneself, right?
*  So if a person comes in and cholesterol is high, right?
*  The first order of business is,
*  hey, you could take better care of yourself, right?
*  Like this person really needs to lose some weight,
*  exercise more, right?
*  They're not just jumping to like,
*  let me give you a medicine
*  and shift you through the healthcare system
*  and out the other side of the door, right?
*  And the same thing is true in mental health.
*  And I'm not trying to be critical to the psychiatrist,
*  the nurse practitioners,
*  the people who are practicing in that way,
*  because oftentimes there is no choice, right?
*  If they're working in a healthcare system,
*  that the standard is highly spaced
*  or it's spaced apart 15 minute visits,
*  what alternative is there, right?
*  But to look at, okay, I'm gonna use medicines
*  because I don't have another tool to bring to bear.
*  So I think the healthcare system
*  and its focus on throughput and its short-term,
*  talk about, you know, we talk about short-term response,
*  right?
*  There's short-term soothing
*  at the expense of long-term health.
*  And I think that is the metaphor
*  that applies to our healthcare system, right?
*  Where if we are gonna try and treat a symptom
*  in a short-term,
*  we're gonna do it in a 15 minute visit,
*  that we're gonna do it in a way
*  that maybe it soothes a symptom, maybe it doesn't,
*  but it does not get at the problem.
*  We need to invest more resources to get at the problem.
*  And I think that's where a sort of protest,
*  you know, if people, as a society, we say,
*  look, we don't like the way our healthcare is going.
*  Like we need more focus on what the actual problems are,
*  that yes, we would spend more money,
*  treating people and taking care of people
*  because it's more human time,
*  but ultimately less suffering, less death, right?
*  And ultimately more productivity.
*  I think as an economy, we would save so much money
*  if we spend money on the human aspects
*  of mental healthcare,
*  because people would be more functional.
*  They're spending less time in the hospital, right?
*  They're more productive when they're working.
*  There's less entry into the criminal justice system.
*  So I think medicines get overused in part
*  for systemic reasons, in large part for systemic reasons,
*  and also for some of these categorization reasons.
*  Oh, that person meets some technical criteria
*  for depression, we've got to give them this medicine
*  instead of really thinking,
*  wait, what's going on in this person?
*  And I see this over and over again.
*  I see someone who's on seven medicines
*  and they're on seven medicines
*  to treat seven different symptoms
*  and now they have side effects from all those seven medicines.
*  Maybe two of them are to treat the side effects
*  from the other five, right?
*  And that's bad, right?
*  And if you really get at what's going on in them,
*  now they're doing much better
*  and maybe they're on two medicines, right?
*  So I don't know if that's a helpful answer to that.
*  It is, it's a very helpful answer.
*  I mean, I think at least in the spheres
*  that I run these days,
*  I hear a lot of negative statements about antidepressants.
*  I think, you know, I'm old enough to remember the book,
*  listening to Prozac, and I remember when Prozac
*  and things like it first started showing up
*  and the excitement and then nowadays I hear more
*  about the problems with all these drugs, you know,
*  and maybe that's just because I have arms
*  in both the scientific but also in the kind
*  of wellness community where people think a lot
*  about behavioral change, fortunately,
*  I think that they do that.
*  But of course, these drugs, as you mentioned,
*  can have enormous utility as well.
*  I'd like to just pick up on one theme
*  that I haven't heard a lot about anywhere else,
*  which is the short term versus the long term use
*  of these drugs, because I could imagine, you know,
*  someone feeling like they're finally gonna tackle something
*  that's been inside them for a long time,
*  either because they're really struggling
*  or because they're just done with not working it through.
*  And they decide to start a medication
*  that would give them higher levels of distress tolerance
*  for a short while.
*  I mean, is there anything to say that someone couldn't take
*  a properly prescribed medication for a week
*  or for the first three months of the work
*  and then know that they can come off it?
*  Because I think that the black and white model of,
*  okay, you're either gonna start this drug
*  and stay on it forever or be taking some drugs forever,
*  or you're not gonna take anything.
*  I mean, that just seems to,
*  life doesn't, does life have to work that way?
*  Is there short term use that can be effective?
*  Yeah, absolutely, yes.
*  In American medicine, we are so much better
*  at starting medicines than we are at taking them away.
*  And part of that, I think, is driven by
*  such a strong presence of the pharmaceutical industry.
*  And the pharmaceutical industry does a lot
*  of very good things, right?
*  But, you know, there's such thing as too much
*  of a good thing, right?
*  And then as a society, when something seems positive,
*  this I think also is human nature.
*  We can over-invest in it, right?
*  So you think about when Prozac
*  and those kinds of medicines came out,
*  they were safer medicines, they're billed as anti-depressants,
*  and the thought was, well, they're gonna fix depression,
*  right, and it's not how that works, right?
*  So if we look at them as tools, right,
*  then we can deploy them sometimes for the longer term,
*  because sometimes that's necessary,
*  but absolutely for the shorter term, I mean, absolutely.
*  If we thought of Prozac and those kinds of medicines,
*  not as, oh, they're anti-depressants,
*  we thought, look, what they do is they seem to make
*  there be more serotonin in certain circuits
*  that are important for mood regulation,
*  anxiety regulation, distress tolerance,
*  so those medicines can really help somebody
*  if they're very severely depressed,
*  and we wanna sort of get them feeling better.
*  They can also help someone
*  if they could use more distress tolerance
*  in a discrete period of time, right?
*  When we think about them that way,
*  we think about them as tools that we could apply
*  for short term or long term.
*  We don't see them as fixes, right,
*  and we don't see them as then substitutes
*  for the human-to-human work that needs to be done.
*  I mean, I've been in my training at times
*  in healthcare systems,
*  and I've seen in many other circumstances
*  that look at medicines as answers,
*  and this idea that, oh, that person is a,
*  and a lot of times there'll be a number, right?
*  The number is the diagnosis,
*  and that number gets this medicine,
*  and I'm not sure we could be more misguided than that,
*  and that's what leads to adding medicines,
*  adding medicines, it's not working,
*  of course it's not working,
*  because no one's really paying attention to what's going on,
*  so add more medicines, and then medicines for the medicines,
*  and I mean, we know this is true.
*  We know this is true,
*  but we haven't had the wherewithal as a society
*  to say, like with a lot of things in society,
*  to say, hey, this isn't okay, right?
*  I mean, we need more.
*  Give these people who are trying to help us,
*  they need more latitude to help us,
*  or we need more human to human contact
*  to get at what's really going on,
*  and yes, that's an investment of time and energy and money
*  in the short term,
*  and sometimes that's money from the systems, right?
*  But if we do that, my goodness,
*  look at the payoff of that.
*  What is your thought about anxiety and ADHD
*  as a separate phenomenon in terms of medication?
*  Again, ADHD is the thing that seems to come up most
*  in questions.
*  I can't tell you the number of, especially students,
*  but also young working professionals,
*  and even people who are outside those categories
*  who are interested in or taking Ritalin, Adderall,
*  Modafinil, Armodafinil, or Vivants,
*  because they seem to struggle focusing without it,
*  or, and I don't know,
*  because I'm not one of those individuals,
*  or because they seem to just like how well they can focus
*  when they do take those compounds.
*  And so my understanding is these compounds mainly
*  increase dopaminergic transmission in the brain,
*  also adrenaline, epinephrine in the brain,
*  so they're more or less stimulants.
*  They look a lot like, at least chemically,
*  they look a lot like cocaine and amphetamine,
*  although they're not quite cocaine and amphetamine.
*  So should we be concerned about this?
*  Is this a different sort of epidemic?
*  Can these drugs be used to train the brain to focus,
*  and then people can withdraw from these drugs?
*  I mean, I think this is a huge topic
*  and one that maybe warrants its own episode entirely,
*  but as long as we're on the topic,
*  what are your thoughts about medication for ADHD?
*  Sure.
*  I think medication for ADHD can be extremely effective,
*  and the studies show us that, right?
*  They show us that if there is ADD,
*  then medication for ADD is very, very helpful,
*  and that's true in youths.
*  It seems to be true if adults have adult ADHD or ADD.
*  We kind of know that's true,
*  but all attention deficit
*  is not attention deficit disorder, right?
*  And there we go to the reflexive 15-minute visits,
*  throw medicines at things, right?
*  Attention deficit can come from many, many places,
*  and one of them is anxiety, right?
*  There's so many other reasons.
*  Depression affects attention,
*  poor sleep affects attention,
*  poor diet can affect attention,
*  stress in life can affect attention,
*  and certainly trauma and the problems that trauma spins off
*  can affect attention.
*  So this is really the truth that while teaching once
*  about medicines and pharmacology,
*  I was frustrated about how the answer to everything
*  was like, what medicine do we use?
*  What medicine do we use?
*  As opposed to like, this is just one piece of the puzzle,
*  and I told an anecdote,
*  which I think it was a clinical anecdote,
*  like what do you think is going on?
*  And I think that if I told that to,
*  I don't know, middle school students or something,
*  they would probably say,
*  you just told the story of a person
*  with a rock in their shoe,
*  which is the story that I was actually telling, right?
*  But several people I was talking to,
*  they're physicians, right?
*  They're like, ADD, right?
*  It's like, no, every time the person steps down,
*  the rock hurts,
*  and they're not able to maintain attention, right?
*  Like, that's what's going on,
*  but we're so programmed to think about medicines
*  and inappropriate use of ADD medicines.
*  As you said, there's dopaminergic impact,
*  there's epinephrine, norepinephrine impact,
*  we're affecting what are called prefrontal alpha-2 receptors
*  that like really need to be helped if there's real ADD,
*  but if there isn't, that is not a good thing to do,
*  which is why it is quite fascinating
*  that when people have ADD,
*  they tolerate generally stimulants very well,
*  without the other problems that can come of stimulants,
*  and again, I don't know,
*  I don't claim to know why that is,
*  but we see that phenomenon,
*  but when people are being treated for ADD
*  and they don't have ADD,
*  which sometimes they know they don't have ADD,
*  but the stimulants make them function better,
*  so they go to somebody and get the stimulants,
*  that's not a good thing to do, right?
*  Because stimulants, when they're not needed over time,
*  they do affect our physical function,
*  they affect our judgment, right?
*  There are a lot of negative things that come from that,
*  they can affect the vigilance inside of us,
*  so yes, it's a valid diagnosis,
*  but it gets made when it's not present, very often,
*  which we see with a lot of diagnoses
*  that you can throw medicine at,
*  we see the same thing with bipolar disorder,
*  true bipolar disorder is extremely important
*  to utilize medicines effectively,
*  but how many people are diagnosed with bipolar disorder,
*  who they absolutely don't have bipolar disorder,
*  but it can be a catch-all diagnosis,
*  because there's in a sense something to do for it,
*  in quotes, right?
*  And you can throw medicine at it, right?
*  So, I mean, what do we expect, right?
*  If we have a healthcare system
*  where you have 15 minute visits with your psychiatrist,
*  of course we're gonna throw medicines at everything,
*  and then the training paradigms are gonna look at it
*  through that lens, and then very often,
*  again, I gave the example of seeing somebody
*  on seven medicines, I mean, the first thought I have is,
*  how many of those medicines are actually counterproductive?
*  And a lot of the time, it's not like,
*  oh, every now and then one is counterproductive,
*  no, that's the case, that's the case a lot of the time,
*  and again, I come back to,
*  if we're not putting thought into it,
*  what other result would we expect?
*  Thank you for that answer,
*  I'm very curious what constitutes
*  negative effects of stimulants,
*  so if somebody's taking Adderall or Ritalin
*  in order to work longer hours or focus
*  because they have attention deficit,
*  but not necessarily ADHD,
*  and again, I'm not recommending anyone do this,
*  I've just heard the numbers that have come back,
*  at least from surveys and discussions
*  with colleagues at Stanford and elsewhere,
*  other college campuses that upwards of 75%
*  of college students use semi-regularly these drugs,
*  off, not by prescription, just to study and to learn.
*  I can imagine sleep issues because these are stimulants,
*  what sorts of other issues can they create
*  for people, problems that they can create?
*  I think a touchstone maybe that's running
*  through our conversation is prioritizing
*  the short-term benefit over solving a long-term problem,
*  which we might say is a human tendency,
*  and we see it across the topics that we're discussing,
*  so short-term use of stimulants,
*  people are more alert, they can stay awake more,
*  they can study more intensely and longer,
*  okay, there's some short-term benefit of that over there,
*  even there there can be problems, right?
*  But we can say, let's just say for sake of argument
*  that in the short-term, there's something to be gained
*  by doing that, right?
*  But, oh my goodness, there's so much risk to that, right?
*  And how many times have I seen someone
*  who they're doing that and they're just doing that to study,
*  right, and now they're addicted to the amphetamines
*  and their behavior changes and they don't know it.
*  Talk about shifting our brain towards a more defensive,
*  sort of suspicious outward look, view of the world,
*  that we see a lot of that.
*  So we see judgment impairment,
*  we see heightened levels of anxiety,
*  we see more impulsivity in decision-making,
*  and sometimes we can get to the point
*  of seeing frank psychosis.
*  Now that's not common, but have I seen young people
*  who've done exactly what you're describing, right?
*  They're using Adderall or they're using Ritalin to study,
*  and then I see them when they're coming into the hospital,
*  screaming about how someone's trying to hurt them,
*  boy, then it's the worst case scenario,
*  but it shows like that's where that can go,
*  and how much is there between the,
*  oh, I'm just using it to study,
*  and that severe outcome that is actually
*  quite negative for a person.
*  It might change how they think about that friendship
*  or that relationship, right?
*  A lot negative happens when we change our brains
*  without an ability to see,
*  like what is it actually doing to us?
*  Which is part of my whole theme about trauma, right?
*  It changes our brains and we don't know it, right?
*  Well, the same can be, the same is often true
*  of amphetamines used inappropriately.
*  It shifts our brain, and we don't realize
*  that we're a little bit more impulsive in our decision-making,
*  a little bit less trusting.
*  These are significant negative things
*  that if we don't know it, person will just say,
*  well, I'm just using it to study,
*  I'm using it to work more.
*  That's not, you know, that's not without
*  its high level of risk.
*  What are your thoughts on cannabis?
*  I've said it many times on this podcast before,
*  I'll say again, I feel fortunate that I've never
*  really been attracted to alcohol or drugs of any kind,
*  in so much so that if all the alcohol and all the marijuana
*  and all the cocaine amphetamine disappeared,
*  I wouldn't notice any change in my life, right?
*  And I feel lucky in that way,
*  because I know a lot of people feel an attraction
*  to these things as almost a gravitational force
*  from their first drink, they just feel.
*  I once heard it described in this,
*  I think it was in Gustin Burroughs' book,
*  Dry, where he was an alcoholic,
*  he said that the first drink he had,
*  it felt like this magic elixir that meshed
*  with the physiology of his blood in the most seamless way.
*  And as I was reading this, I thought, oh my goodness,
*  first of all, that's the most foreign experience for me
*  in terms of alcohol.
*  And second, gosh, that must be terrible,
*  and you can, but at the same time,
*  you could really understand
*  why someone would be drawn to that.
*  Cannabis nowadays is legal or decriminalized
*  in many areas of the US.
*  A lot of people seem to use the argument,
*  it's better than drinking,
*  or they only do it for sleep or anxiety management.
*  I'm not looking to demonize or support the cannabis.
*  So what are your thoughts about cannabis
*  for anxiety management, depression,
*  and maybe even for ADHD for that matter?
*  Sure, if I could make an alcohol comment, right?
*  The number of times I've seen alcohol,
*  like having been a good idea for coping with something,
*  it approaches zero.
*  The alcohol for coping is just never good.
*  And there's an additional risk factor
*  that there are certain genetic profiles
*  where people respond strongly to alcohol,
*  like as you're saying, it's not just, oh,
*  there's a little bit of short-term relief of distress,
*  but there's a sort of euphoric response.
*  And those genetics, we don't understand them completely.
*  They seem to be in Northern European populations,
*  more prevalent as you had West in Northern Europe.
*  So we understand that where risks factors are demographically,
*  but we can't pinpoint that for any one person.
*  And there's a tremendous risk of that
*  when a person responds so strongly to alcohol
*  or habituates coping to alcohol.
*  Cannabis is a little bit of a different story.
*  I mean, how I have seen that play out,
*  and again, this isn't coming from any expertise
*  around the neuropharmacology of it,
*  like how's this really working in the brain,
*  it comes from an observation that what it seems to do
*  is to narrow our attentional perspective.
*  So it's why people will say, well, they wanna use cannabis
*  before watching a movie with friends or something.
*  And I think, okay, I think why people are doing that
*  is because a cognitive spectrum narrows,
*  and then instead of worrying about that thing at work
*  or that relationship issue, one can just be present
*  for it gates out other attentional intrusions.
*  So in some ways, I mean, I've absolutely seen it
*  be helpful to people.
*  I mean, it's been legalized in Oregon,
*  which is where I spend a lot of my time,
*  and it's not where all of my practice is.
*  But what I have seen is it is at times helpful,
*  save around sleep, right?
*  Because a person can gate out other intrusive thoughts
*  and they can just relax and go to sleep.
*  But there can be another side of that too,
*  that at higher levels of distress,
*  at higher levels of tension,
*  what it can do is narrow the focus of cognition
*  to the thing that is negative, right?
*  So the idea that, oh, this is a treatment for,
*  depression, anxiety, trauma is not true, right?
*  Can it be helpful under certain circumstances?
*  I think the answer to that is yeah.
*  I mean, I know the answer to that is yes,
*  because I've seen it play out clinically that way,
*  but I think it can also be harmful too.
*  So there again, like anything that has any power,
*  power to influence our brains,
*  we wanna be thoughtful and careful about it.
*  I mean, do I think that it's safer than alcohol?
*  Yes, I mean, we so clearly see that.
*  Does that mean it was just uniformly safe?
*  No, right?
*  So we wanna be respectful of anything
*  that can change how our brain is working,
*  and I think that certainly includes alcohol,
*  and I think it certainly includes cannabis too.
*  I'd love to talk about psychedelics for two reasons.
*  One, there seems to be a tremendous amount of interest
*  in psychedelics as a therapeutic clinical tool.
*  I know there's also recreational use,
*  and I'll just preface all this by saying that my stance is,
*  we absolutely know for sure that these are controlled
*  substances, they're illegal to possess, sell, or use
*  in most of the country.
*  There are a few areas where they are decriminalized.
*  And psychedelics is a broad category, of course,
*  and we can touch on some of the different ones.
*  But whereas five years ago or so,
*  I was truly afraid to say the word psychedelics
*  in any kind of public venue,
*  there are laboratories at Stanford working on ketamine,
*  psilocybin, MDMA, mostly in animal models.
*  There's terrific work going on at Johns Hopkins
*  School of Medicine and Matthew Johnson's lab and others,
*  looking at the clinical applications,
*  mainly of high dose psilocybin and LSD.
*  There's the MAPS trials with MDMA.
*  So nowadays it's safe for an academic like me
*  to say the word psychedelics.
*  And I'd love to approach this question of psychedelics
*  from a place of true exploration and curiosity,
*  but with the preface that we're talking about this
*  in a legal clinical setting.
*  And the legality is something that's now in process.
*  I don't think it's completed, but that's my understanding.
*  But there are trials.
*  You can go to clinicaltrials.gov and put in MDMA
*  and you'll see a bunch of clinical trials
*  that are happening in the recruiting subjects.
*  So I think it's safe to have the conversation now.
*  And I'd love your thoughts about psychedelics.
*  Maybe we could start with psilocybin and LSD
*  as a broad category of drugs that at least my understanding
*  is they touch on mainly the serotonin system,
*  some specific receptor activation and modulation
*  tend to change notions of space and time,
*  adjust internal state.
*  Maybe we would start there and then maybe venture
*  into some of the other ones.
*  So what are your thoughts on these drugs
*  for therapeutic potential, also potential hazards, et cetera?
*  Yeah, I think if we look at the true psychedelics,
*  so psilocybin and LSD, because ketamine and MDMA,
*  they're different categories of medicine.
*  They're these sort of novel tools to bring to bear.
*  But if we start with psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics,
*  I think why they have gained so much momentum
*  over the last several years is because the data
*  coming from the labs and the academic centers
*  is so powerfully positive.
*  And as someone who's, I'm interested in anything
*  that's potentially helpful, right?
*  And I wanna learn and understand that
*  because a lot of things that are potentially helpful,
*  you know, you go and look at the data
*  and you see that that's not helpful or that that's harmful.
*  I think what we have seen with psychedelics
*  is that they're so helpful, right?
*  And the trials are bearing that out.
*  And of course, these are used in professional hands
*  and with the right kind of guidance
*  are extremely powerful tools, but used in the right way
*  by someone who knows how to utilize them
*  in the right set and setting
*  can have an immense positive impact.
*  And that's why I think that the thought is there
*  across people and more and more people feel comfortable
*  saying it and talking about it.
*  I mean, we're in the state of Oregon now
*  where the thought is we're moving towards legalization
*  of psilocybin early in 2023.
*  And it's part the new data, right?
*  And how it meshes with the older data, right?
*  How it meshes with data from the 60s and 70s
*  that showed such a strong powerful impact
*  of these medicines.
*  And I have a whole set of thoughts about
*  what's happening there and they're just,
*  they're conjectures, right?
*  But my read of, you know,
*  as best I can try and understand the neuroscience
*  and the clinical applicability and the changes is,
*  you know, what happens is we see less communication,
*  less chatter in the outer parts of the brain, right?
*  The outer parts of the cortex.
*  And I think that as human beings,
*  we sort of glorify the parts of the brain
*  that only we have.
*  I mean, certainly in my growing up, right?
*  What did I learn, even if you think about
*  learning about the brain in high school, right?
*  I learned that like, wow, we're great as humans
*  because we have language and other animals don't,
*  and we can use tools and like, aren't we so great
*  because we have this part of the brain
*  that other animals don't and it lets us function, right?
*  Okay, there's some truth to that, right?
*  That we can do things others can't do,
*  but we get lost often in the outer parts of the cortex,
*  which I think are about survival, right?
*  So we come back to the things you and I talked about
*  early on of like, why are these trauma mechanisms in us,
*  right?
*  So much of what's going on in our brains is about survival.
*  And I think living, so to speak, in the cortex, right?
*  In the outer part of the brain is consistent
*  with a focus on survival.
*  So if you think that's where language is,
*  that's where vision is, that's where executive function is,
*  so planning and task execution.
*  So, so much of that is about making our way
*  in the world around us.
*  So we tend to glorify that and think, well, that's,
*  in a sense, where our existence is, right?
*  And I believe that is not true, right?
*  And again, can I say that for sure?
*  Like, of course not, right?
*  But my read of 20 years of doing clinical work
*  and thinking about all sorts of medicines
*  and thinking about the psychedelics in a lot of depth,
*  I think that what they do is they take us out of the cortex,
*  because that's where we run into these problems.
*  That's where we bounce things over and over again,
*  that the distress centers deep in our brain,
*  in the brainstem, kind of ally
*  with the outer parts of the cortex.
*  And they say, right, we're in distress,
*  we wanna stay alive.
*  Often, a lot of us have had trauma
*  that makes these changes in the brain,
*  and then we're thinking all the time,
*  like, what would I do if there were war?
*  What would I do if there's civil war,
*  if someone bombs us?
*  What will I do if the economy collapses, right?
*  What will I do if somebody gets sick?
*  We're thinking all this future projection
*  that is all coming from a place of fear, right?
*  It's all coming from a desire to think about things
*  and control the future with this part of the brain
*  that is so uniquely human, right?
*  And I think when we take the neurotransmission
*  out of those places, right,
*  and we set it in a part of the brain
*  and say the insular cortex, right?
*  The parts of the brain that are sort of in the middle,
*  which I think, I believe, is where our humanness really is.
*  So the psychedelics make there be less chatter,
*  communication, these other parts of the brain,
*  and then we become seated in the part of the brain
*  that I believe is most about our experience
*  of true humanness, which is why, when you read about
*  people who have experiences, and I've heard about them,
*  people talk to me about this, right?
*  They've utilized it, they talk with me.
*  So whether it's someone telling me their story
*  or it's coming from research data,
*  it's why people can sort of see with clarity
*  that, oh, that trauma, that thing is not my fault.
*  Really, we feel a sense of compassion for ourselves.
*  We relieve ourselves, release ourselves from guilt,
*  and it's like, why is this so helpful to people?
*  And I think it's because it can do
*  what we are trying to get at in good therapy,
*  but it can really catalyze that by just putting a person
*  in that part of the brain that can see it for what it is
*  without all that chatter in the cortex about,
*  hey, you gotta think it's your fault,
*  or you won't avoid it again,
*  and that makes the repetition compulsion.
*  How do I think ahead to the next thing that might happen,
*  and what else bad might happen?
*  We don't get anywhere doing that,
*  and I think where we get somewhere
*  is when we seat ourselves deeper in the brain,
*  which I think we do if we're doing really good therapy,
*  and we're in the deep parts of the brain,
*  but these psychedelics, the medicinal value, I believe,
*  is putting us in that part of the brain
*  where a person can really find truth,
*  and that's why I think that it's come so far
*  in these few years,
*  because I think that is very clinically evident,
*  and I think we're gonna see more and more the value of that,
*  and how what the psychedelics do can become, I believe,
*  a heuristic for understanding,
*  like, wait, how are our brains really functioning,
*  and what are the parts that really matter
*  to our experience of being human?
*  It's those parts of the brain, right,
*  the deep parts of the brain,
*  the insular cortex and the areas around it
*  that say light up when a person has
*  an experience of spiritual ecstasy,
*  or an experience of connection with another person, right?
*  So we kind of have these telltale markers
*  that something is going on there
*  that's very important and very special,
*  and I think we're more attracted
*  to the outer parts of the brain,
*  and the inner parts are easier to study, right?
*  I mean, as you know better than I do,
*  we started studying the brain through lesion studies, right?
*  Because it was easier to see
*  if a person got hurt in this part of the brain
*  or had a stroke in that part of the brain, what changes?
*  So we look at the cortex,
*  because one, it's easier to study,
*  and we tend to glorify it,
*  and I think that has been misguided,
*  and I think that we're learning
*  about how that's been misguided
*  through the study of these novel modalities
*  from Western perspectives,
*  but of course they've been used for a long, long time
*  in other cultures, but novel from our perspective.
*  Yeah, I'm fascinated by this idea
*  that in these middle brain structures
*  is where our humanity lies,
*  and as you said, I also wonder whether or not
*  other animals experience life more from that orientation
*  with less chatter.
*  We can only guess, but you know,
*  the dog lover and being in the presence of animals
*  seem to just be present in what's happening
*  in their immediate environment,
*  not too much anticipation.
*  There's sentience, right?
*  I mean, what you're talking about is sentience is important,
*  and sentience is extremely important, right?
*  And if we're going to overvalue, say, language,
*  then I think we undervalue sentience, right?
*  Which is why I think we tend to undervalue animals, right?
*  And they're suffering,
*  because well, they're not saying anything about it, right?
*  And you know, they're not writing about it,
*  so okay, it's easy to ignore.
*  And we think about, again, the hubris of that, right?
*  Oh, because we can think and talk and write.
*  Like, we must be feeling more
*  than species that don't do that.
*  I mean, I think that is so true,
*  and that we're going to understand more
*  about sentience and other species,
*  and how that's at the core of existence.
*  And my hope would be that we value more humans and animals,
*  right, through the evolution of that understanding.
*  The hallucinations that accompany psychedelics
*  like LSD and psilocybin have such an attractive force
*  to them as a concept and as an experience.
*  And so I think most often when people hear hallucinogens,
*  they think, and psychedelics,
*  they think about hallucinating.
*  Right.
*  Makes sense why they would.
*  But what's so interesting to me
*  is nothing in your answer about psychedelics,
*  psilocybin and LSD focused on hallucinations per se.
*  It was more about feeling states,
*  accessing a feeling state or a relation to an event
*  or to a person or to oneself.
*  Maybe even I caught hints of maybe even empathy
*  for oneself for the first time.
*  None of that had to do with seeing sounds
*  or hearing colors and these kind of cliche statements
*  about hallucination.
*  So I am aware of laboratories,
*  one at University of California Davis in particular,
*  but a few others that are trying to generate
*  chemical variants of psychedelics
*  that lack the hallucinogenic properties
*  but maintain these other properties as therapeutic tools.
*  And as I say that, I realize that people
*  in the psychedelic community are probably thinking,
*  oh, that's horrible.
*  That's the dismantling of the core thing.
*  But the simple question is,
*  do you think the hallucinations are valuable for anything?
*  And I think we're really getting into the philosophical,
*  the ontological.
*  There's this sort of trying to understand being.
*  And I don't claim to know the answer to that.
*  I think that at times it seems like the hallucinations
*  have a metaphorical or a symbolic way of being helpful.
*  Because people will come to understand things
*  that they hold dear and true after the experience, right?
*  That often, not always,
*  come through the lens of the hallucination.
*  So are the hallucinations necessary?
*  Are those hallucinations sometimes important, sometimes not?
*  I mean, I think we don't understand that.
*  And I think we wanna be respectful
*  of the sort of mystery of that.
*  But what I think is fascinating is,
*  you think about substance abuse and what that means is,
*  well, one aspect of that is that a person has experiences,
*  thoughts, conceptions of self in the world
*  with the substance that without the substance,
*  they know are wrong, right?
*  People talk about liquid courage, right?
*  And, okay, I feel better about myself
*  and I feel courageous because I've had a couple of drinks.
*  Now, after that, I feel normal about myself
*  and that was false, right?
*  And we see that,
*  that's part of what substance intoxication means, right?
*  But what we see with the psychedelic medicines
*  is something that's incredibly different, right?
*  That people are having experiences that are so delinked
*  from our normal experience of reality.
*  And then when they come in a sense back online
*  in a normal cognitive way, they realize like, wow,
*  now I'm applying all those mechanisms
*  of trying to understand truth to that.
*  And what I see is that it's true.
*  And wow, it's true.
*  I mean, we hear that all the time,
*  which tells me, hey, something different is going on there.
*  And of course, these are powerful tools.
*  And so, it's like, wow, I'm so used to it.
*  I'm so misused, like very bad things can happen.
*  But you think about the clinical utility
*  and what does it mean that so many people
*  change for the healthier or even change their lives
*  after an experience because it so resonates as like,
*  oh, now I understand something that's true.
*  And it's not something bizarre.
*  It's like, I wasn't responsible for being raped that time.
*  Or, you know, I'm not less than,
*  even though my sexuality or my gender identity
*  is not the same as the other way around.
*  And so, I think that's a very important concept, right?
*  Like people kind of can often get it
*  and they feel differently about themselves
*  and guilt and shame are impacted.
*  So, I think we're likely to see
*  that they are powerful anti-trauma mechanisms,
*  again, used clinically in the right hands.
*  And I think that we're also gonna see
*  that they're a heuristic for understanding our brain
*  that goes against what I see as some of the reflexive hubris
*  of, well, the outer parts must be the best
*  for a human.
*  I mean, it makes no sense, you know?
*  I'd like to talk about MDMA.
*  And I'll preface this by saying I was a participant,
*  actually, technically, I'm still a participant
*  in a clinical trial.
*  So, I have experience of doing it twice.
*  The trial involves three separate dosings of this.
*  I was reluctant to do it outside of a clinical trial,
*  mostly because I was aware there can be some cardiac effects
*  and I liked the idea there'd be a clinician on hand.
*  And I'll just say that I found the experiences
*  to be profound, beneficial, and very different
*  from one session to the next.
*  The first one felt a whole collection of ideas
*  and relational things came up
*  that felt very powerful and transformative.
*  And I do think that I learned there.
*  I exported a number of things.
*  My particular experience isn't relevant here.
*  But the second time I expected it to be the same way
*  and it was very mellow and relaxing
*  and was deeply tied to kind of notions of acceptance.
*  So, there weren't all these revelations and wow,
*  new insights, it was very much about sort of grounding
*  into a kind of a calmer state.
*  So, I have the personal experience of benefiting from these
*  in ways that I think still benefit me
*  and was very struck by the power of MDMA.
*  And my very crude understanding of the pharmacology
*  and the state that is being under MDMA
*  is that it encourages or increases
*  dopaminergic transmission,
*  but also serotonergic transmission,
*  which is to my knowledge, a kind of a rare state
*  for the brain to be in.
*  That typically it's more of a seesaw
*  of dopaminergic drive towards external goals
*  or more serotonergic drive towards more placidity
*  or comfort with what one already has.
*  And so, with both those systems amplified,
*  the only way I can describe it subjectively
*  is that everything sort of funneled back in
*  and it was almost like a pursuit of inner landscape.
*  And I can only imagine what it would be like
*  in the context of doing this with somebody else
*  also taking MDMA, I have no idea what that's like.
*  That's my report of the experience.
*  I know that the experience can vary.
*  What are your thoughts about the chemistry
*  and what sorts of states do you think MDMA is creating
*  that can explain why it's a useful therapeutic tool
*  in some cases and what sorts of cases those might be?
*  Sure, sure.
*  To clarify, I think part of what we're starting with
*  is like this is very different than the psychedelics,
*  which are seeding our consciousness
*  in these deep centers of the brain.
*  Whereas what MDMA is doing is sort of flooding
*  with positive neurotransmitters
*  in certain parts of the brain.
*  And I think what that creates is a greater permissiveness
*  inside to entertain or approach different things.
*  So I think where we see it's tremendous,
*  my read of the data is around potentially
*  and we're seeing in some of the trials,
*  tremendous benefit for trauma.
*  And you think about what we were talking about earlier,
*  how this reflexive guilt, shame, hypervigilance, avoidance.
*  And when these systems are flooded
*  with these neurotransmitters,
*  it's more permissive to sort of think about that, right?
*  And to think about that without, again,
*  all the chatter of that's your fault
*  or you're never gonna get anywhere because of that,
*  or you know what that means, right?
*  They could kind of go away and then we can think about it
*  in a way that isn't through the lens of fear, right?
*  And I think that's the power there
*  is that it's permissive of approaching something,
*  contemplating something, a novelty.
*  As we talk about a de novo approach.
*  And I think that's also why the experience can vary
*  because you could also see how
*  if you're not thinking about something, right?
*  So there's not a clinical guidance to it.
*  You could be in a state where like,
*  I just feel good, right?
*  And I'm thinking about good things
*  and like that can feel good, right?
*  But that's not necessarily problem solving, right?
*  So the clinical guidance says,
*  hey, let's take that state and do something with it, right?
*  Now that you're in this state,
*  hey, let's make, hey, well, the sun is shining, right?
*  You're in a state where we can look at things
*  that are traumatic, right?
*  We can approach them from a de novo perspective.
*  And I think it's part, I think that explains
*  why you had these different experiences
*  from one to the other,
*  because your brain is just in a state
*  that's conducive to something, right?
*  But if there's not the mechanism to have that thing happen,
*  like conducive to something therapeutic,
*  then you might go there on your own,
*  or you might just be in a state
*  where you have a sense of wellbeing and you sit with that.
*  So it sort of seems like a waste to me.
*  I mean, this is what I tell people
*  when they ask about MDMA.
*  I said, at least from my experience,
*  the potential hazard there is that
*  in that very high dopaminergic, serotonergic state,
*  there were moments where I felt like I could get excited
*  about any one specific concept
*  that I might even just think about, for instance,
*  water and how nourishing it is,
*  and really just go down the path of water
*  and the world and all the water.
*  You're in a state that is very prone to suggestion,
*  internal suggestion.
*  And so the guidance turned out,
*  the guidance from the clinician turned out
*  to be immensely valuable in allowing me
*  to go into my own heads for bits of time,
*  but then also to resurface and share and exchange
*  in a way that to, I'm trying really get something out of it
*  that was useful and that I could export,
*  because of course water is wonderful,
*  but I'm not really interested
*  in growing my relationship to water.
*  And I really felt like I could understand for the,
*  I never went to raves or anything growing up.
*  I never did MDMA recreationally,
*  but I understood for the first time
*  how people could get really attached to an environment
*  and feel connected to things,
*  because I think with all that serotonin,
*  you just feel connected to everything around you.
*  So I think it's a slippery slope there.
*  And I don't know what the future
*  of the clinical use of MDMA looks like,
*  but I would hope that whoever's thinking about
*  I'm guiding these sessions is really thinking carefully
*  also about evolving the practice
*  to help people really move through in a sequential way
*  so they can leave with something valuable.
*  Yes, 100%, 100%.
*  These are such powerful tools.
*  And again, if they're powerful tools
*  and we're using them without respect for them, right?
*  Without clinical guidance, we incur risk, right?
*  I mean, getting obsessed with water,
*  well, on it probably isn't gonna hurt you, right?
*  But if someone is out using it,
*  there's around other people,
*  what one can feel positively about
*  or become sort of obsessed in the short term about
*  can be very counterproductive, right?
*  There can be a lot of risk to that.
*  So I think it anchors back to these are very powerful tools.
*  We're coming to understand them much, much more,
*  and we're coming to understand
*  that they have immense potential to be helpful to us.
*  But I think and hope that that only also increases
*  our respect for those modalities
*  and what negative can happen
*  if we're not respectful.
*  It's gonna be very interesting to see
*  where all of this goes in the next few years,
*  not just in Oregon, but elsewhere.
*  It's one way or another, it's happening.
*  It seems to have a momentum that is not going to stop.
*  So very exciting area to be sure.
*  I agree.
*  I have a question about language.
*  In your book, you talk about how we need to be careful
*  about the use of language around trauma,
*  maybe problem solving and problem describing in general.
*  At one extreme, you hear that your brain and your body
*  hear every word you say.
*  And we have to be so careful with language.
*  And that actually frightened me for a number of years
*  because I would hear that and I thought,
*  gosh, if I just think that something is bad,
*  now it's gonna hurt me worse,
*  which itself is part of that whole packing down of an issue.
*  Very hard to avoid thoughts without distraction.
*  So that's one extreme.
*  On the other hand, I can tell somebody I love them
*  with a tone of hatred.
*  I can tell somebody I hate them with a tone of love.
*  So how should we think about language in parsing trauma?
*  And in your book, you talk about,
*  you give some cautionary notes about talking about
*  depression, trauma and PTSD in terms that might diminish
*  their real severity in some cases.
*  And I was really struck by that.
*  So maybe you just touch on how should we talk about
*  these things in a way that doesn't diminish them
*  for ourselves or for other people?
*  And at the same time, honors the fact that
*  there's a lot of trauma out there
*  and there's a lot of depression out there
*  and we need to talk about it.
*  Yeah, I think this is a very complicated
*  and in many ways convoluted topic.
*  I think it's wonderful that we have language,
*  but boy, language leads us astray often too.
*  And I think when you think about how people define words,
*  like someone says a word,
*  does a person know what that word means?
*  What nuance are they taking from it?
*  We just have to be very careful what we're saying
*  and what we're communicating.
*  And I think this doesn't mean,
*  because there's a sort of phenomenon now
*  where people are trying to control language,
*  I think too much.
*  Like you can't say anything
*  that someone else might find hurtful.
*  You have to refer to people in ways they choose
*  or ways that others don't understand
*  or ways they themselves have decided
*  or ways that might be psychologically
*  or clinically unhelpful.
*  So I think the over control of language is not good.
*  But I think the specificity of language,
*  of what are we trying to say?
*  How are we defining it?
*  Even the word trauma, right?
*  We're talking about trauma.
*  So we want to define what that means, right?
*  It doesn't just mean like,
*  oh, anything kind of negative, right?
*  Because then that dilutes it down to meaning nothing, right?
*  It also doesn't just mean injury and combat, right?
*  We have to talk about what that is.
*  So I think anchoring it to something
*  that rises to the magnitude of overwhelming
*  our coping skills and changing us,
*  like then at least I define it that way
*  and I can communicate that to you
*  and we can understand what we're talking about, right?
*  I think that another aspect of language,
*  while again, we need this middle ground
*  and I don't think that it is okay
*  for the over control of language to shut down expression,
*  but we also have to acknowledge
*  how we're so much less distanced from each other
*  through social media
*  and I think social media can do very, very good things
*  as hopefully we're doing now, right?
*  But it can also be used to harm people from a distance, right?
*  And how much hatefulness is there out there
*  that I think comes from anger and frustration in people,
*  going back to trauma, right?
*  Where people just want to be angry
*  and it's not really issues that they're talking about,
*  but then there's a target of that anger
*  and people feel beleaguered by that
*  and the words that people use sometimes are so awful
*  that someone reading that,
*  like if you're in the demographic that's being targeted,
*  and you're reading that,
*  I mean, how does a person not feel beset upon, vulnerable?
*  And then I think that also fuels things like we just had,
*  this is terrible shooting in Buffalo, right?
*  Like just hate motivated, right?
*  Because that kind of language becomes very real to people
*  who may take it in, it fuels their hate
*  and then they do something to enact it,
*  which of course creates greater fear and vulnerability.
*  And I think there was some civility and decorum
*  that was in our world not that long ago, right?
*  I mean, I'm in my early 50s, I'm not that old, right?
*  But I remember a time when in political discourse,
*  say people were civil to one another, right?
*  Now, so much, I mean, it's not all of it, right?
*  But there's an acceptance of things
*  that are just bombastic, right?
*  It's a circus sideshow sometimes
*  of people being just angry and aggressive
*  and it's not really linked to anything,
*  although it's allegedly linked to something,
*  but then other people's anger can attach to it
*  and it's not about what it's about,
*  but it's about aligning with the anger.
*  And I think that there is so much damage
*  that comes from that.
*  And I think, should it be okay
*  that people sometimes are talking, communicating,
*  using language in ways that would like
*  get us suspended from middle school, right?
*  Ways I don't want my eight-year-old to see.
*  I mean, is that really okay or do we need to take a stand
*  for like rational use of language?
*  I don't want my use of language to be over controlled
*  by someone who thinks they sort of understand better
*  than the rest of us how to communicate with those, okay?
*  I don't want that.
*  I don't want that to be stereotypically
*  a sort of idea of the left, say, right?
*  At least in our society.
*  But I also don't want language, it can be so angry
*  and so aggressive that it is perpetuating
*  or spreading vulnerability and that it facilitates trauma.
*  And I think we could set standards as a society
*  where we say, look, I don't want anybody in power
*  who's gonna behave that way, right?
*  I don't care if their whole agenda is like,
*  make Paul Conti's life better.
*  I'm still not gonna vote for you, right?
*  If you're behaving towards others in a way
*  that's denigrating, you're behaving in a way
*  that I feel essentially ashamed of, right?
*  And I feel that a lot, right?
*  I see the politics, you know, I see things play out.
*  It's not always political.
*  Of course, not always political, but I see things play out
*  and I think, oh my gosh, I feel embarrassed.
*  Like we're somehow okay with this.
*  Well, it doesn't matter which side
*  of the political spectrum it's coming to.
*  And I think that's an indicator that what we're doing
*  is really hurtful to us.
*  People become more angry.
*  They attach to the anger.
*  People feel more beleaguered.
*  There's more divisions between us.
*  And it seems more and more like, well, we can only
*  really identify with people who are just like us.
*  And like, what does that really mean?
*  I mean, the divisions that it creates between us
*  and that promotes so many negative things, right?
*  I mean, think about ways in which it promotes
*  white supremacy, right?
*  It's just one example, right?
*  And we've seen that play out
*  that this is really bad for us and we've got to look at that.
*  I mean, if we don't look at that,
*  I don't think it's always something is going to happen.
*  Like something is happening, right?
*  It's happening now.
*  Yeah, and it really, to my mind, it really seeps down
*  into the soil of everything that we're talking about
*  on all sides.
*  People are activated.
*  People are upset about one thing or the other.
*  Right.
*  No one is immune from upset,
*  regardless of political affiliation.
*  And everybody seems to be upset nowadays.
*  And as I was hearing you talk about this,
*  I feel a lot of resonance with what you said.
*  And I also am hoping you run for office.
*  Thank you.
*  I don't think I have the gumption for that,
*  but thank you for that.
*  That would be wonderful.
*  Thank you.
*  I'd like to talk about a concept of taking care of oneself.
*  This comes up in the book.
*  This is something we talk a lot about on this podcast.
*  I mean, I think people have heard me blab endlessly
*  and I'll probably go into the grave
*  telling people to get sunlight in their eyes when they can
*  and to try and get proper sleep
*  and to have a few tools for reducing their anxiety
*  in real time and on and on and on.
*  We hear about this concept of taking care of oneself.
*  And I think at a surface level,
*  it can sound a little bit light.
*  Take care, take good care.
*  But to me, it's a deep and powerful concept.
*  And I was very happy to see it in your book
*  and also to learn a lot of ideas
*  about what that really looks like.
*  Because whether or not somebody is in the early stages
*  of considering whether or not they have trauma
*  or is in the deep stages of working that through
*  or has made it through the tunnel some distance,
*  taking care of oneself is an ongoing process.
*  I'd love for you to just describe
*  what taking care of oneself means to you as a clinician.
*  And of course, the practices and things
*  that you encourage people to do.
*  But how should we think about taking care of oneself?
*  Because on one extreme, you could imagine a massages,
*  retreats, vacations and chefs for hire
*  that take care of everything for ourselves.
*  And on the other extreme, you could say,
*  leaning into life in a way that you're paying attention
*  to small things while working very, very hard.
*  So it's such a big concept.
*  But how do you think about taking care of oneself?
*  How should I take care of myself?
*  How should people take care of themselves?
*  Sure.
*  I see here what I think is a very fascinating dichotomy.
*  That in some ways, think about how complex our brains are.
*  How complex our psyches or unconscious minds are.
*  There's so much complexity there.
*  But on the other hand, psychological concepts
*  that are consistent with health are often very simple.
*  By which I don't mean light.
*  But simple, straightforward.
*  And I think self-care is absolutely one of them.
*  How much is talked about, how to take care of oneself,
*  that just skips over the basics that are necessary
*  as a building block for all else.
*  So it doesn't matter how many chefs or vacations
*  or whatever a person has, if the basics of self-care
*  aren't squared away.
*  And it's not a light concept to say,
*  like, look, are you sleeping enough?
*  Are you eating well?
*  Are you getting natural light?
*  Are you interacting with people
*  who are good to interact with?
*  Are you accepting negative interactions in your life?
*  Are you living in circumstances
*  that make you feel okay or not?
*  They're very, very basic premises.
*  But so often, we're not looking at them at all.
*  We're not looking at them at all
*  because we tend to skip over them.
*  And we tend to skip over them either because, again,
*  in some automatic way that sometimes is trauma-driven,
*  we're not gonna look at that, right?
*  And often not taking care of ourselves,
*  can have the punishment, distraction, right?
*  There's so much that can come into that.
*  Or our sense of power is tied
*  to not taking care of ourselves.
*  I mean, I'll give you an example is,
*  I tend to, for whatever reason, do reasonably well
*  with very poor self-care, right?
*  And that was very adaptive
*  when I was into medical training, right?
*  And I'm like, okay, I can eat a lot today,
*  I can not eat, right?
*  I can sleep two hours, I can sleep eight, right?
*  I mean, overall, that's not good.
*  And it hasn't been good for me as I've aged.
*  But then I realized at some point,
*  look, I'm doing all these things
*  that make myself healthier, but what, I ignore that?
*  And why am I ignoring it?
*  That was the key question.
*  Why am I ignoring it?
*  Because somewhere inside of me, as it was,
*  and still to some extent is,
*  this idea that my ability to be really functional, right?
*  To generate success in the world around me
*  is tied to my ability to do that, right?
*  But if I stop doing that,
*  and now I'm like, I'm eating and sleeping regularly,
*  then I'm gonna lose some edge.
*  And so, and even I think about this all the time,
*  but I realize, hey, I'm also, I'm not doing it inside.
*  And I think it's really grounding to the basics
*  that really help us of like,
*  what are the basics of what I'm doing
*  and not doing in my life?
*  Diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances,
*  leisure activities, I mean, sunlight.
*  I mean, I think immensely important
*  and dramatically undervalued.
*  Well, I wanna thank you for that.
*  And I wanna thank you for today's discussion.
*  I found it to be incredibly informative.
*  And I know our listeners will also.
*  I also wanna thank you for the work you do.
*  I mean, you obviously run an incredibly
*  robust clinical practice that I'm aware
*  that you're constantly trying to improve,
*  even though it's operating at the highest levels already.
*  And I really, the reason why you're here today
*  is because I've done a wide and deep search
*  for people in these areas.
*  And there are so few who have the background
*  in medical training and physiology
*  in the psychoanalytic and psychiatric realm,
*  and also have a grounding toward the future,
*  what's coming and who can encapsulate
*  so many different orientations
*  and bring them together into a coherent piece.
*  So I really thank you.
*  Yeah, and for your book, which is incredible,
*  I will go on record saying,
*  I think this is the definitive book on trauma.
*  And I really encourage people to read it
*  and will continue to encourage people to read it.
*  So many valuable takeaways and insights and tools there.
*  So on behalf of the listeners and myself,
*  thank you so much for joining us today.
*  You're very welcome.
*  And I take that to heart
*  and I'm very appreciative of being here.
*  So you're very welcome and thank you as well.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you for joining me for my discussion
*  with Dr. Paul Conti.
*  I also highly recommend that you explore his new book,
*  which is Trauma, The Invisible Epidemic,
*  How Trauma Works and How We Can Heal From It.
*  It's an exceptional resource,
*  both for those that have trauma
*  and those that don't have trauma
*  or those that suspect they might have trauma.
*  Again, it's a deep dive into what trauma is
*  and offers many simple tools that anyone can apply
*  with a therapist or not in order to heal from trauma.
*  And if you'd like to learn more about Dr. Conti
*  and the work he does directly with patients,
*  please check out his website, pacificpremiergroup.com.
*  We've also provided a link to both the book
*  and pacificpremiergroup.com in the show note captions.

*  Not so much in today's episode,
*  but in many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,
*  we discuss supplements.
*  While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
*  many people derive tremendous benefit from them
*  for things like improving the transition time
*  and the depth of sleep each night,
*  for improving focus, for managing anxiety,
*  and for many other aspects of mental health,
*  physical health, and performance.
*  For that reason, the Huberman Lab podcast
*  has partnered with Momentous Supplements,
*  because first off, they are of the very highest quality.
*  They also ship internationally,
*  which many other supplement companies do not.
*  And we wanted to have a one-stop location
*  where people could find and access the supplements
*  that are discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast.
*  So if you go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman,
*  you will find many of the supplements
*  that are commonly discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast.
*  I should just mention that the catalog of supplements there
*  will be expanding in the weeks and months to follow,
*  but already a number of them for sleep and focus
*  and other aspects of mental health,
*  physical health, and performance are already there
*  at livemomentous.com slash Huberman.
*  If you're not already following Huberman Lab
*  on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.
*  There I cover science and science-based tools,
*  some of which overlaps with the content
*  of the Huberman Lab podcast,
*  but much of which is distinct from the information covered
*  on the Huberman Lab podcast.
*  We also have a newsletter called
*  the Neural Network Newsletter,
*  where we offer distilled information,
*  so lists of protocols and key takeaways
*  from podcast episodes.
*  If you want to sign up for the newsletter,
*  all it requires is your email.
*  Please know that we do not share your email with anybody.
*  We have a very clear privacy policy.
*  You can find all that by going to hubermanlab.com.
*  There's a menu there where you can sign up
*  for the Neural Network Newsletter.
*  You can also immediately get access
*  to some example newsletters
*  so you know what the newsletter is all about.
*  So thank you once again for joining me
*  for my discussion with Dr. Paul Conti.
*  And last but certainly not least,
*  thank you for your interest in science.
