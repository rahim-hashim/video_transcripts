Video Description: In this episode, my guest is Dr. Becky Kennedy, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist and renowned expert on parent-child relationships and emotional processing. Dr. Kennedy is also the founder of Good Inside, an educational platform for parents and parents-to-be. We discuss how to learn, embody, and teach better emotional processing, leading to healthier relationships—not just in the context of parent-child dynamics but also in the workplace, romantic partnerships and friendships.

Dr. Kennedy shares practical strategies for managing guilt, building frustration tolerance, nurturing emotional intelligence, and being a sturdy parent or person in general. We also explore the impact of technology on emotional processing in both kids and adults and discuss ways to foster greater feelings of capability and confidence. This conversation applies broadly to all types of social connections and aims to empower listeners to cultivate more resilient, loving and supportive relationships.

# Dr. Becky Kennedy Overcoming Guilt & Building Tenacity in Kids & Adults
**Andrew Huberman:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=0.0s)]
*  where we discuss science [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2.36s)]
*  and science-based tools for everyday life. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  I'm Andrew Huberman, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6.0s)]
*  and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10.56s)]
*  at Stanford School of Medicine. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  My guest today is Dr. Becky Kennedy. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=15.6s)]
*  Dr. Becky Kennedy is a clinical psychologist [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=18.1s)]
*  and one of the world's foremost experts [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=20.48s)]
*  in parent-child relationships. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=22.32s)]
*  Now you may or may not have children. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  If you do, today's episode is absolutely for you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=26.28s)]
*  If you don't, well, you were once a child. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=29.44s)]
*  Perhaps you're even still a child. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  Today's episode also will have valuable knowledge [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=34.08s)]
*  and tools that you can apply to your life. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=36.46s)]
*  Today, Dr. Becky Kennedy teaches us an immense number [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=38.92s)]
*  of extremely valuable tools for the workplace, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=41.74s)]
*  for romantic relationships, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=45.04s)]
*  for family relationships of all types, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=46.56s)]
*  not just parent-child relationships, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=48.5s)]
*  and of course, also for parent-child relationships. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=50.16s)]
*  We discuss themes that have not been discussed previously [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=53.44s)]
*  on the Huberman Lab Podcast. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=55.96s)]
*  Topics such as guilt, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=57.52s)]
*  which Dr. Becky Kennedy offers [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=59.0s)]
*  a completely unique perspective on, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=60.36s)]
*  one that I've never heard before, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=62.040000000000006s)]
*  and that frankly, I don't think anyone has heard before. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  In fact, she distinguishes [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=66.0s)]
*  between what most people think is guilt [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=67.0s)]
*  and an entirely different set of emotions, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=69.28s)]
*  and offers you very useful practical tools [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=71.56s)]
*  for when you experience guilt and how to work with guilt. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=74.04s)]
*  We also extensively discuss frustration, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  or what she calls frustration tolerance. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=79.12s)]
*  Frustration tolerance is an extremely important theme [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=81.68s)]
*  for everybody to understand and apply in their lives, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=84.62s)]
*  because frustration tolerance, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=87.04s)]
*  as Dr. Becky Kennedy so aptly points out, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  is central to the learning process [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=91.14s)]
*  of anything at every age. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=92.92s)]
*  If you can understand this concept [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  and you apply some of the very simple rules and tools [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=96.94000000000001s)]
*  that Dr. Kennedy explains during the podcast, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=99.12s)]
*  I assure you, you can learn many more things [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=101.54s)]
*  much more quickly and with much greater satisfaction, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=104.26s)]
*  if not during the process, certainly at the end, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=107.56s)]
*  when you master that learning. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=110.0s)]
*  And those are just a few of the themes [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=111.84s)]
*  that we discussed during today's episode. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  Again, whether or not you have children, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=114.76s)]
*  I assure you that today's episode [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=116.76s)]
*  is going to be immensely beneficial [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=118.4s)]
*  for all of your relationships. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=120.18s)]
*  You will notice during today's episode [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  that our studio backdrop is different. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=124.16000000000001s)]
*  You will notice that for once, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=126.56s)]
*  I was not wearing this particular style of shirt. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=128.4s)]
*  The reason for that is that this episode [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=130.94s)]
*  was recorded during the LA fires, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  what was initially called the Palisades fire, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=134.76s)]
*  and then spread to multiple fires throughout LA County. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=137.44s)]
*  So we were not able to access our normal studio. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=140.56s)]
*  So I want to express extreme gratitude to Rich Roll, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=143.36s)]
*  our good friend in the podcasting space, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  who allowed us to use his podcast studio, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  which is where I'm seated now [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=151.16000000000003s)]
*  and where I held the discussion with Dr. Becky Kennedy. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  First off, our entire team, our homes and our studio [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=155.4s)]
*  are fine, I can assure you of that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=158.52s)]
*  But most importantly, our thoughts and our prayers [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=160.78000000000003s)]
*  go out to the people who have lost their homes, lost pets, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  and sadly there have been fatalities during the LA fires. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=166.68s)]
*  So our thoughts and prayers are with them [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  and their families, and we hope everyone remains safe. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=171.6s)]
*  Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=175.12s)]
*  is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=177.76s)]
*  It is however, part of my desire and effort [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=180.44s)]
*  to bring zero cost to consumer information about science [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=182.32s)]
*  and science related tools to the general public. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=184.76s)]
*  In keeping with that theme, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=187.2s)]
*  today's episode does include sponsors. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=188.4s)]
*  And now for my discussion with Dr. Becky Kennedy. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=190.85999999999999s)]
*  Dr. Becky Kennedy, welcome back. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=194.0s)]
*  I'm so happy to be here. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=196.72s)]
*  Grateful to Rich Roll for lending us his studio [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=198.48s)]
*  under the duress of fires in Los Angeles. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=202.04s)]
*  I'm praying that his home is okay. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  It's unclear at this moment, but in any event, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=207.83999999999997s)]
*  let's talk about emotions, both theory and practice. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=212.44s)]
*  And if we can place it in the context of parenting, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=216.92s)]
*  that would be great, but I'm certain that this [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=219.67999999999998s)]
*  has a broader theme that pertains to everybody. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=222.39999999999998s)]
*  So I love the theory of emotions [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=225.04s)]
*  or how we would theoretically respond to something, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=227.78s)]
*  but then there's the reality. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=230.44s)]
*  So as a parent, let's say you have a stance in your home [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=231.94s)]
*  and in your family that it's okay to be sad. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=236.98s)]
*  Like sadness is normal, it happens, it passes, et cetera. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=240.9s)]
*  Let's say you're feeling particularly sad about something. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=245.58s)]
*  Do you express that and show that in front of your kids? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=250.46s)]
*  Because I've also heard that young kids in particular, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=253.22s)]
*  younger than eight or nine, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=256.9s)]
*  perhaps shouldn't be aware that their parents [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=259.58s)]
*  are experiencing, say, extreme sadness [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=261.52s)]
*  because it can be scary to them [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=264.53999999999996s)]
*  or they might feel like their world is destabilizing. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=266.41999999999996s)]
*  And then we also hear a lot about kids feeling [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=268.46s)]
*  like they had to parent the parents, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=271.17999999999995s)]
*  and then this whole thing becomes pretty complicated. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=272.94s)]
*  So while there's no perfect world [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=274.62s)]
*  where one knows what to do every single time, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=277.09999999999997s)]
*  how do you look at this business of modeling emotions [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=280.5s)]
*  and also encouraging kids to be able to experience [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=284.34s)]
*  and express their emotions? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=287.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and I think everything I'm about to share [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=289.34s)]
*  applies in the workplace. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=291.58s)]
*  Can a boss be really upset [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=293.53999999999996s)]
*  in front of the person they manage? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=296.41999999999996s)]
*  Management, so it's all the same stuff. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=297.62s)]
*  So I guess zooming out as a start, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=299.85999999999996s)]
*  emotions are normal, emotions are unstoppable. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=303.96s)]
*  You can't not feel sad just because you have [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=309.32s)]
*  your five-year-old in the room. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=311.76s)]
*  And I think the other thing that forms my perspective [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=314.26s)]
*  is it's really hard to not show someone that you're sad. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=318.02000000000004s)]
*  Like you might think you're doing that well, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=323.02000000000004s)]
*  but kids are extra perceptive. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=325.38s)]
*  They are actually built to be more perceptive than we are [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=328.06s)]
*  because their survival depends on adults, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  so they have to always notice, is my adult around? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=333.86s)]
*  Is my adult okay? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=337.02s)]
*  So they really attune to what's going on for us. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=338.02s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=341.62s)]
*  And so I think the kind of question is less, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=342.90000000000003s)]
*  do I show my emotions to my kid or not? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=346.42s)]
*  And it's more, okay, if I'm sad, my kid is gonna notice. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=349.38s)]
*  What do I do then? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=353.66s)]
*  And as a principal, one of the things I think about often [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=356.70000000000005s)]
*  is information doesn't scare kids [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=359.1s)]
*  as much as the absence of information scares kids. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=362.06s)]
*  So let's say there's something really awful. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=366.34000000000003s)]
*  I don't know, as a parent, you're a family member. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=369.38s)]
*  Someone died of cancer. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=372.7s)]
*  I don't know, there's something really horrible [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=373.98s)]
*  that you just found out, right? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=375.78s)]
*  There's wildfires right now. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=378.3s)]
*  Let's say you evacuated and you found out [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=379.7s)]
*  your house burned down, you're sad. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=382.38s)]
*  Your child is going to notice that, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=385.82s)]
*  and you want your child to notice that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=388.24s)]
*  You don't want your kid to be a teenager and adult [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=391.14s)]
*  who goes around the world unable to pick up [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=395.06s)]
*  non-emotional cues from other people. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=399.98s)]
*  That's not adaptive. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=401.7s)]
*  And so the patterns we set with our kids when they're young [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=402.86s)]
*  inform their view of the world when they're older. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=406.82s)]
*  And so here I am, let's say it's the situation [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=410.98s)]
*  of somebody dying and I'm upset. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=413.94s)]
*  First of all, as a parent, tell yourself, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=415.82s)]
*  it's not my kid seeing me sad [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=417.98s)]
*  that's going to destabilize them. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=421.62s)]
*  It's seeing me sad and me making up a bogus story [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=424.1s)]
*  or denying it because then my kid goes, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=428.94s)]
*  pretty sure my mom was upset. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=431.86s)]
*  Oh, she's not? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=433.18s)]
*  Oh, she's pretending like nothing happened? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=434.14s)]
*  Oh, she looks sad, but she's saying she's not sad. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=435.9s)]
*  That is really upsetting. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=439.3s)]
*  It would be like hearing your boss say, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=441.06s)]
*  oh yeah, 20% layoffs. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=444.5s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=446.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=446.94s)]
*  Oh, hi, everything's great. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=447.76s)]
*  How are you? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=448.7s)]
*  Like, what is happening? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=449.54s)]
*  Scary. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=451.26s)]
*  What you'd want is your boss say you just heard something. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=452.1s)]
*  You were right to hear that. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=454.48s)]
*  We are about to go through a really tough time. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=456.64s)]
*  I'm stressed about it. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=460.2s)]
*  That's why I yelled. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=461.04s)]
*  You might be stressed. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=462.12s)]
*  Here's what I know. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=462.96s)]
*  This is going to be hard [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=464.86s)]
*  and we're going to get through it together. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=465.7s)]
*  Now, all of a sudden, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=467.32s)]
*  that emotional experience has a container. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=469.08s)]
*  It has a story. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=472.24s)]
*  Humans need stories. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=473.48s)]
*  We like stories. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=475.15999999999997s)]
*  And so often we think it's the emotions [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  that dysregulate a kid. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=479.3s)]
*  It's the lack of a story to explain it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=480.96s)]
*  So let's say this really did happen. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=484.08s)]
*  People always say to me, okay, but Dr. Becky, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=486.44s)]
*  my kid is four. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=488.96s)]
*  I'm going to say that their aunt died. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=489.88s)]
*  They don't even know cancer, right? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=491.76s)]
*  We don't have a better alternative. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=494.28s)]
*  I can't even tell you how many parents I've seen [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=495.71999999999997s)]
*  whose kids have all of these issues [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=497.4s)]
*  because of the made-up stories. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=499.5s)]
*  I just said she went to sleep for a while. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=500.88s)]
*  Six months later, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=503.12s)]
*  my kid has a lot of trouble sleeping through the night. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=503.94s)]
*  Yeah, they haven't seen their aunt [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=505.91999999999996s)]
*  who went to sleep one time. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=507.47999999999996s)]
*  You know, creates a huge issue [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=508.84s)]
*  no matter what bogus story you make up. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=511.0s)]
*  Kids can handle the truth [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=513.74s)]
*  and they can handle the truth when it's told to them [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=515.78s)]
*  from a loving, trusted adult. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=518.98s)]
*  It's kind of like me and you. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=520.46s)]
*  Someone can tell us a hard truth, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=522.0600000000001s)]
*  but it's from someone you feel safe with [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=523.4s)]
*  and that you feel like also believes in you [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=525.74s)]
*  and says that honestly, it might be hard, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=528.1s)]
*  but it doesn't feel awful. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=530.44s)]
*  So it's about saying to your kid, you saw me crying. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=532.62s)]
*  One of my favorite kind of sentences [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=537.62s)]
*  to say to kids around this, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=540.0600000000001s)]
*  because I think it really builds their confidence, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=541.3s)]
*  is just you were right to notice that. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=543.04s)]
*  I was crying and I'm feeling sad. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=546.36s)]
*  And look, you saw that. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=548.92s)]
*  I'm gonna tell you why. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=550.3199999999999s)]
*  Making this up, Aunt Sally died. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=553.16s)]
*  Do you know what dying means? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=556.7199999999999s)]
*  Dying is when someone's body stops working. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=558.56s)]
*  Then I pause, right, so it's gonna just be a monologue. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=562.68s)]
*  I'll see how my kid responds. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=564.88s)]
*  I might add, I'm not dying. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=566.26s)]
*  Kids actually really need to hear that in hard times. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=569.9599999999999s)]
*  I'm not dying. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=573.88s)]
*  No one else is dying. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=575.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm safe. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=577.96s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=579.08s)]
*  I'm sad. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=580.4000000000001s)]
*  And I'm still your strong mom who can take care of you. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=582.2s)]
*  That sets the stage for such resilience [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=586.0400000000001s)]
*  and is kind of the opposite of everything's fine. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=589.08s)]
*  My kid keeps seeing me crying. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=593.32s)]
*  They keep hearing words they're not used to hearing. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=595.2s)]
*  Die, cancer, Aunt Sally, funeral, whatever it is. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=597.36s)]
*  And that information is what makes kids feel [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=600.64s)]
*  really, really uncomfortable and unsafe. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=602.56s)]
*  So it's the absence of information that causes the harm. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=605.92s)]
*  And it's the lack of coherence [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=611.24s)]
*  between what they're observing and feeling [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=613.6s)]
*  and kind of this like open loop. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=616.04s)]
*  If I kind of place it in neuroscience-y terms, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=620.4s)]
*  I feel like the brain does think in terms of stories. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=622.76s)]
*  Stories have a beginning, middle, and an end, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=626.66s)]
*  and they kind of want to know where they are [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=628.56s)]
*  in that story. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=630.12s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=631.4s)]
*  And the terms I would use to match your terms [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=632.36s)]
*  are coherent narrative. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=634.76s)]
*  What is therapy? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=637.88s)]
*  Why does therapy help people? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=638.72s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=639.8s)]
*  Therapy doesn't change what happened to you. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=640.64s)]
*  Therapy doesn't change your past. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=642.32s)]
*  Therapy does not take away the pain. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=643.68s)]
*  But the pain was never the thing that really got in our way. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=646.32s)]
*  It was the pain plus a lack [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=651.04s)]
*  of a coherent narrative and support. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=652.88s)]
*  And so early on, when kids have painful experiences [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=655.44s)]
*  from witnessing you or something else, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=658.12s)]
*  giving them a coherent narrative is what they need. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=660.36s)]
*  And without that, the way I think about it is [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=663.36s)]
*  they have what I call unformulated experience. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=665.8000000000001s)]
*  It's just affect and experience [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=668.9200000000001s)]
*  that kind of free floats in their body, unformulated. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=671.4000000000001s)]
*  That tends to later show up as triggers, right? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=675.5200000000001s)]
*  And kind of other things in adulthood. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=678.76s)]
*  And so, yeah, that's what we want to try to avoid [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=680.88s)]
*  when we can. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=683.12s)]
*  I'd like to take a quick break [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=684.8000000000001s)]
*  and thank one of our sponsors, Wealthfront. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=686.0s)]
*  I've been using Wealthfront for my savings [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=688.28s)]
*  and my investing for nearly a decade. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=690.04s)]
*  And I absolutely love it. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=692.04s)]
*  Every January, I set new goals for the year. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=693.8s)]
*  And one of my goals for 2025 is to focus on saving money. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=696.12s)]
*  Since I have Wealthfront, I'll keep that savings [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=699.96s)]
*  in my Wealthfront cash account, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=702.0s)]

*  For more information, see the episode description. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=772.56s)]
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Our Place. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=775.3199999999999s)]
*  Our Place makes my favorite pots, pans, and other cookware. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=778.3199999999999s)]
*  Surprisingly, toxic compounds such as the PFASs, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=781.76s)]
*  or forever chemicals, are still found [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=784.4799999999999s)]
*  in 80% of nonstick pans, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=786.3199999999999s)]
*  as well as utensils, appliances, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=788.68s)]
*  and countless other kitchen products. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=790.28s)]
*  As I've discussed on this podcast, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=792.16s)]
*  these PFASs, or forever chemicals, like Teflon, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=793.9s)]
*  have been linked to major health issues [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=796.76s)]
*  such as endocrine disruption, gut microbiome disruption, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=798.2399999999999s)]
*  fertility issues, and many other health problems. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=801.24s)]
*  So it's really important to avoid them. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=803.88s)]
*  This is why I've recently fallen in love [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=806.0s)]
*  with Our Place products, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=807.54s)]
*  especially one of their cooking pans, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=809.12s)]
*  the Titanium Always Pan Pro. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=810.62s)]
*  Our Place products are made [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=812.84s)]
*  with the highest quality materials [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=813.94s)]
*  and are all PFAS and toxin-free. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=815.48s)]
*  They're beautifully designed and function extremely well. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=818.02s)]
*  As I mentioned, I love the Titanium Always Pan Pro [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=821.12s)]
*  from Our Place. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=823.84s)]
*  I cook eggs in it most mornings, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=824.9s)]
*  and the Titanium Pan is designed in a way [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=826.48s)]
*  that allows the eggs to cook perfectly [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=828.6s)]
*  without sticking to the pan. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=830.4s)]
*  I also cook burgers on it, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=831.84s)]
*  and it really puts a nice sear on the burger [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=833.1s)]
*  without the meat sticking to the pan. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=834.88s)]
*  It's extremely easy to clean, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=836.54s)]
*  and like all Our Place products, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=837.92s)]
*  it's nice to look at when sitting out [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=839.88s)]
*  on the counter or stove. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=841.38s)]

*  I can't help but put this neuroscience lens on this [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=866.1999999999999s)]
*  because I find it so interesting [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=869.1999999999999s)]
*  that what you're basically saying, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=871.76s)]
*  if I understand correctly, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=874.24s)]
*  is that until we can place things into a story, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=875.24s)]
*  which is really a sense of beginning, middle, and end, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=878.02s)]
*  a sense of time, it just reverberates in us. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=880.48s)]
*  I mean, I think, I can't help myself. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=884.52s)]
*  I don't wanna give the impression [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=888.2s)]
*  we've got fires burning all around us [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=889.08s)]
*  in terms of this building, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=891.04s)]
*  but with some distance between us and the fires, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=891.88s)]
*  that's actually true. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=894.08s)]
*  And I think one of the things that's so destabilizing [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=894.9s)]
*  for kids and adults in this kind of circumstance [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=897.96s)]
*  is that we don't know how this is gonna work out. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=900.12s)]
*  We just don't. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=902.84s)]
*  And of course, none of us have a crystal ball. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=903.6800000000001s)]
*  We can't peer into the future. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=905.92s)]
*  But it's the not knowing [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=907.48s)]
*  that really extends our brain resources. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=908.64s)]
*  And I can imagine that for a kid, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=911.44s)]
*  seeing their parent upset and then hearing, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=913.22s)]
*  well, no, I'm okay, I'm okay, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=915.76s)]
*  would create this kind of open loop [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=918.2399999999999s)]
*  where then the kid has to worry about it. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=920.64s)]
*  When will this come to an end? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=923.68s)]
*  One question about expressing sadness in front of a child. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=926.56s)]
*  And if let's say somebody expresses why they're sad, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=931.1999999999999s)]
*  is it okay to accept consolation from the kid? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=934.52s)]
*  Because we hear so much that we shouldn't have to parent, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=939.0s)]
*  as children, we shouldn't have to parent our parents. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=942.38s)]
*  And this is a big theme, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=944.72s)]
*  especially on social media nowadays. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=945.96s)]
*  Were you the parent to your parent? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=948.12s)]
*  Were you the one that took out the trash [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=950.0400000000001s)]
*  when someone else should have done it [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=951.82s)]
*  and therefore you took on more responsibilities? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=952.88s)]
*  I don't want kids to think they shouldn't take out the trash. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=955.4s)]
*  But you know what I mean? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=957.08s)]
*  But if you're consoling a parent about a lost job, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=958.48s)]
*  if you're the kid that is sort of the go-between [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=961.72s)]
*  between the parents as sort of acting as therapist, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=965.32s)]
*  we hear about this a lot, a lot. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=967.48s)]
*  And I think a lot of people peer into their past [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=969.84s)]
*  and say, yeah, I grew up way too fast. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=971.96s)]
*  So on the other hand, I think we would all agree [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=975.12s)]
*  that being a empathic person, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=978.2s)]
*  teaching our kids that if somebody's crying, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=982.2s)]
*  walk over to that person perhaps and just say, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=984.96s)]
*  do you want me to sit with you or maybe do nothing at all? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=988.0400000000001s)]
*  Maybe offer a solution, maybe not, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=990.4000000000001s)]
*  but at least provide some sort of support. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=992.44s)]
*  That seems healthy. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=994.6800000000001s)]
*  But the basic question is, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=996.48s)]
*  should parents accept consolation from children [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=997.5s)]
*  when the parent is sad [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1002.1800000000001s)]
*  or experiencing some other negative emotion? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1003.1s)]
*  I think this is a great question. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1005.6600000000001s)]
*  There's a couple of things that are coming to mind. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1007.26s)]
*  So first of all, all of this is a matter of extent [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1008.74s)]
*  and patterning. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1011.7s)]
*  Yes, we do not want our kids to feel like it is their job [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1012.94s)]
*  to take care of our emotions. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1017.14s)]
*  It's not a good situation. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1019.38s)]
*  And I think the difference here actually comes down [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1021.74s)]
*  to what the true definition of empathy is. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1024.38s)]
*  To me, empathy is noticing someone's feelings [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1027.74s)]
*  and caring about them. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1030.38s)]
*  It's not taking care of them. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1032.6000000000001s)]
*  That's a big difference. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1036.3400000000001s)]
*  So let's say I'm crying and my kid comes over [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1037.42s)]
*  and this whole situation, maybe somebody died [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1040.0600000000002s)]
*  and they're like, oh my goodness, mom, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1043.0600000000002s)]
*  can I give you a hug? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1044.6200000000001s)]
*  And do you want me to get you a cup of water? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1046.0200000000002s)]
*  Okay, I just want parents to know, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1049.3000000000002s)]
*  you don't have to say, no, no, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1050.14s)]
*  I do not want you to be a parentified child. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1051.5800000000002s)]
*  Like, be like, that is so, that is so kind. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1053.7800000000002s)]
*  Yes, that would feel great. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1057.8200000000002s)]
*  Okay, that's totally fine. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1059.14s)]
*  I think the line is, and every parent just knows this [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1061.18s)]
*  for themselves, where it might get to, oh, you know what? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1063.5800000000002s)]
*  I love that you're noticing I'm sad [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1068.14s)]
*  and I love that you care about that. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1070.1000000000001s)]
*  And I also wanna let you know, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1071.8600000000001s)]
*  those are my feelings, not yours. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1074.74s)]
*  And I am really able to take care of them myself [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1077.8600000000001s)]
*  with whoever it is, a friend. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1081.7800000000002s)]
*  And you're still really allowed to be a kid [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1084.46s)]
*  who can go play, who can go have fun, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1086.7s)]
*  who can even not listen to me once in a while [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1089.9s)]
*  when I say it's bath time, that's actually your job. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1091.6200000000001s)]
*  So let's go do our jobs well. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1094.9s)]
*  And to me, that comes down to what empathy is, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1097.22s)]
*  the delineation of like, what is a parent's job [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1099.98s)]
*  and what is a kid's job. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1102.3000000000002s)]
*  But also I think all of this can get misrepresented [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1104.5s)]
*  in social media. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1107.5400000000002s)]
*  And I don't want parents to think that they always [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1109.02s)]
*  have to chastise their kid for acting in a caring way. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1110.94s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1113.62s)]
*  I feel like kids are, as you said before, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1114.78s)]
*  kids are so perceptive about what their parents [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1116.9799999999998s)]
*  are experiencing and they'll create [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1119.2199999999998s)]
*  or move towards all sorts of emotional gymnastics [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1122.1799999999998s)]
*  in order to work with that. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1126.1s)]
*  Years ago, I saw, I think it was a YouTube video [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1127.2199999999998s)]
*  with Jim Carrey, who basically revealed [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1129.8999999999999s)]
*  that he became funny as a way to make his sick mom laugh, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1132.26s)]
*  that he grew up with a very sick mom [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1138.1s)]
*  which is chronically ill. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1139.8999999999999s)]
*  And so he would like throw himself down the stairs [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1141.3799999999999s)]
*  and try and make her laugh or do, you know, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1143.74s)]
*  and he was an incredible world-class physical comic [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1145.1399999999999s)]
*  among other aspects of comedy. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1149.6999999999998s)]
*  But that his whole career was born out [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1152.34s)]
*  of this childhood tendency to notice [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1153.9399999999998s)]
*  that his mom was really hurting [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1156.5s)]
*  and try and basically make her laugh, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1158.4599999999998s)]
*  make her feel something good. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1160.78s)]
*  And it, you know, now I'm thinking about this [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1162.6599999999999s)]
*  because it's just incredible the way [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1164.74s)]
*  that kids can pick up on something [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1167.1799999999998s)]
*  and then try and find a solution to it. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1168.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1171.3s)]
*  You know, I could imagine that for kids [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1172.1399999999999s)]
*  who have a sick parent, could be a mental challenges [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1173.1799999999998s)]
*  or physical challenges that they've got to notice. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1176.9799999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1179.9399999999998s)]
*  And in the case of Jim Carrey, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1180.78s)]
*  one could argue whether or not it was adaptive [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1182.1399999999999s)]
*  or not adaptive, he had this, you know, meteorite career, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1183.62s)]
*  but eventually just left it, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1186.6999999999998s)]
*  decided that wasn't what he wanted to do. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1188.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1190.5s)]
*  But leaving that extreme example aside, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1191.9399999999998s)]
*  let's say a parent is sick with the flu [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1194.8999999999999s)]
*  or is grieving the loss of, God forbid, a spouse [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1197.14s)]
*  or something really major. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1201.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1204.3400000000001s)]
*  At what point does the parent need to say, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1206.22s)]
*  listen, I'm really hurting, this is bad, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1209.94s)]
*  and I can handle it? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1214.9s)]
*  When that might not actually be true. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1216.3000000000002s)]
*  So the question is, you know, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1219.0600000000002s)]
*  how much information to give kids? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1221.5400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1224.18s)]
*  Because you don't want to lie to them. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1225.0200000000002s)]
*  On the other hand, you don't want them to feel the burden [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1226.22s)]
*  of needing to worry about a circumstance. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1228.8600000000001s)]
*  And I'm framing this in the context of sick parent, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1232.22s)]
*  but I'm also raising this thing of financial worries. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1234.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1238.38s)]
*  I have a close friend who told me that growing up, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1239.22s)]
*  their parent was constantly dealing with, you know, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1242.74s)]
*  moving from one job to the next. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1247.74s)]
*  It was like this issue of whether or not [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1248.9s)]
*  we're going to have enough resources [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1250.3s)]
*  to get through the next year was a constant question. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1251.94s)]
*  And this person is now in their mid-30s, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1255.42s)]
*  and you can tell it still haunts them. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1258.5800000000002s)]
*  And it's completely shaped their relationship [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1260.3400000000001s)]
*  to work in finances. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1261.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1262.9s)]
*  I mean, I think we can think about this compared to, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1263.74s)]
*  what would I want from my boss? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1266.98s)]
*  I have a boss who's, I don't know, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1268.94s)]
*  going through a really hard time [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1270.42s)]
*  or having a really hard time at home, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1271.94s)]
*  and I kind of notice it. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1273.8200000000002s)]
*  I'd probably want my boss to level with me and say, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1275.3000000000002s)]
*  kind of again, you're right to notice [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1277.5s)]
*  I'm going through a hard time. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1278.98s)]
*  But at what point would it feel like, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1281.98s)]
*  ooh, am I safe in this organization? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1284.14s)]
*  Right? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1287.66s)]
*  I think we probably all have a point there, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1288.5s)]
*  and I think it's the same thing with kids. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1290.0200000000002s)]
*  Kids really do need to feel like they have sturdy parents. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1292.3400000000001s)]
*  Again, I always go back to pilots [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1297.26s)]
*  because I think airplane examples are so powerful [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1298.74s)]
*  because there's very few times in adulthood [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1301.22s)]
*  that we actually feel like our safety is truly dependent [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1303.74s)]
*  on another adult, like 100%. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1306.8600000000001s)]
*  When you're a passenger in an airplane, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1309.6200000000001s)]
*  you are 100% dependent. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1311.6200000000001s)]
*  So it's kind of the closest dynamic. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1313.38s)]
*  And you can imagine what it would be like [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1316.3400000000001s)]
*  if the pilot was saying, going through a really hard time, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1318.38s)]
*  who wants to come in and give me, you know, I don't know, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1320.5400000000002s)]
*  you know, tell me a nice story. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1323.5400000000002s)]
*  Oh my goodness, like, Kat, you're going through a hard time, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1325.5800000000002s)]
*  but this is really not feeling great, right? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1328.2600000000002s)]
*  And what that means, and which is kind of even a larger point [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1331.42s)]
*  is if you're a pilot, you need to make sure [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1334.7800000000002s)]
*  you're really doing a lot of self-care [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1337.42s)]
*  more than the average person [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1339.74s)]
*  because of this outsized responsibility you have. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1340.9s)]
*  This is what I think about parenting. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1344.98s)]
*  And it's why from, you know, the bigger theme here [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1346.38s)]
*  is this is what gets me out of bed, you know, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1349.42s)]
*  every morning so motivated is not just to help parents [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1351.74s)]
*  understand tantrums or emotions or, you know, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1354.3000000000002s)]
*  the latest struggle in their house. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1357.42s)]
*  Although I actually love that. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1358.9s)]
*  It's just like, hold on, like we've been really sold [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1360.94s)]
*  like an awful story about what it really means [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1364.02s)]
*  to be a parent and how parenting really, first and foremost, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1365.9s)]
*  is a journey of self-care. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1370.5s)]
*  How can I be the sturdiest person possible? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1372.34s)]
*  Who do I need in my life when things go poorly [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1374.58s)]
*  so I don't lean on my young children [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1378.46s)]
*  and give them a responsibility that is not theirs? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1381.78s)]
*  You know, I was just saying to someone the other day [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1385.5s)]
*  that when you have kids, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1387.58s)]
*  all of the unhealed parts of your childhood [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1390.5s)]
*  come right before your eyes. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1394.26s)]
*  They are just triggered over and over and over [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1395.58s)]
*  with your own children. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1398.46s)]
*  Oh, my kid's whining, I can't deal with that. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1400.66s)]
*  Oh, well, whining is probably triggering [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1402.78s)]
*  because it's kind of representative of helplessness. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1405.62s)]
*  What was it like in my family if I kind of felt helpless? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1408.58s)]
*  Was that allowed? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1410.78s)]
*  Did I grow up in a, you know, if you don't stop crying, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1411.62s)]
*  I'll give you something to cry about family. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1414.94s)]
*  Okay, if I don't resolve that, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1417.02s)]
*  I'm going to act that all out on my children [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1418.94s)]
*  and pass that along. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1421.94s)]
*  So all of kind of these situations where parents are feeling [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1423.54s)]
*  all these different emotions from a trigger, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1428.94s)]
*  from something in their life, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1430.78s)]
*  I think it goes to what I always tell parents, you know, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1432.6599999999999s)]
*  you have a first and foremost job of self-care [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1435.34s)]
*  and taking care of yourself. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1440.1399999999999s)]
*  That doesn't mean traveling to Europe for the year [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1441.34s)]
*  and leaving your kids alone. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1443.3s)]
*  It means what is going on inside you? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1444.62s)]
*  What skills do you need? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1446.78s)]
*  What networks of support do you need? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1448.06s)]
*  What do you have around you to help you [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1450.42s)]
*  on the hardest journey of your life [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1452.74s)]
*  and the most rewarding one of being a parent [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1454.3799999999999s)]
*  so that you don't have to say to your kids, you know, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1457.38s)]
*  oh, you know, can you kind of take care of me? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1460.5400000000002s)]
*  Paul Conti, who came on this podcast [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1465.18s)]
*  to do a series about mental health, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1467.14s)]
*  not just mental challenges, but also mental health, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1469.74s)]
*  which is an interesting concept in its own right, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1472.8200000000002s)]
*  has been quoted as saying that, you know, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1476.8200000000002s)]
*  that if you were to list out the hundred most important [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1478.5800000000002s)]
*  things for romantic relationships, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1481.2600000000002s)]
*  it would be self-care and communication repeated 50 times. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1483.46s)]
*  And I'm thinking about that now [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1488.46s)]
*  because it sounds like a pretty good model [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1490.26s)]
*  for pretty much every relationship. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1492.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1494.3400000000001s)]
*  Self-care, communication. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1495.18s)]
*  And I must say, the first time I heard him say that [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1496.22s)]
*  it wasn't on my podcast, it was on a different podcast, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1498.02s)]
*  sort of surprised, I thought, self-care first? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1501.6200000000001s)]
*  But the way you're framing it seems to me [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1504.46s)]
*  that if self-care comes first, or at least very high [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1507.26s)]
*  on the list of what parents should do, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1510.8600000000001s)]
*  it frees up the kids to live and experience life [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1512.94s)]
*  with a lot more ease, a lot more peace, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1516.3400000000001s)]
*  and to basically unburden them of about 50,000 jobs. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1520.8600000000001s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1525.5800000000002s)]
*  And I think self-care has gotten, you know, misrepresented. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1526.42s)]
*  It doesn't mean getting a manicure every week. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1531.26s)]
*  It could, if that does it for you. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1533.18s)]
*  But when I think about self-care, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1535.02s)]
*  and I really think about the work we do with parents [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1536.1000000000001s)]
*  at Good Inside, we always say Good Inside, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1538.02s)]
*  and like our app, it's not parenting. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1540.58s)]
*  It's for parents. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1543.1399999999999s)]
*  It's for the journey of what it means to be a parent. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1544.3799999999999s)]
*  It's for your own stuff. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1546.54s)]
*  It's for your triggers. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1547.5s)]
*  It's for finally learning how to set boundaries. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1548.94s)]
*  It's about finally learning [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1551.46s)]
*  that it's okay to get your needs met, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1553.54s)]
*  even when they inconvenience others. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1555.3799999999999s)]
*  It's learning that your relationships are strong enough [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1557.34s)]
*  that they can get through hard moments [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1561.1399999999999s)]
*  where people are upset with you, right? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1562.94s)]
*  It's about finally saying to, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1565.1399999999999s)]
*  if you need to, your mother-in-law, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1567.82s)]
*  we can't have any visitors on Saturday. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1569.34s)]
*  And the reason I'm finally able to do that [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1571.4599999999998s)]
*  is because I understand my self-value [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1573.4599999999998s)]
*  and all this stuff that has nothing to do with [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1575.54s)]
*  the fact that your kid isn't sleeping at night. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1578.06s)]
*  But that is the foundation for intervening [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1579.74s)]
*  in the way you're proud of [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1583.22s)]
*  when your kid is waking you up at two in the morning, right? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1584.58s)]
*  So that is the self-care. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1587.1s)]
*  It's really like a, not just self-care, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1588.4199999999998s)]
*  it's self-establishment. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1590.4599999999998s)]
*  It's self-growth, really. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1592.06s)]
*  I don't know the psychology literature [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1595.1799999999998s)]
*  or clinical literature around this, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1597.34s)]
*  but I'm thinking about speed of emotional shifts. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1598.9s)]
*  In my own experience of life, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1604.6200000000001s)]
*  I've known moody people, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1607.3000000000002s)]
*  and I've known not as moody people. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1609.74s)]
*  I define moody as people whose moods fluctuate quickly [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1612.66s)]
*  and sometimes spontaneously. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1616.18s)]
*  But this idea that some people are steady as a rock [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1617.98s)]
*  is a great concept. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1621.8200000000002s)]
*  But we also know that we need to feel our emotions, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1623.74s)]
*  express them to some extent. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1626.18s)]
*  And yet there are people where if we were to plot this, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1628.22s)]
*  it would look like a high-frequency wave [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1631.1000000000001s)]
*  where some people are really upset, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1632.8600000000001s)]
*  then they're feeling better again. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1634.22s)]
*  They're upset, then they're feeling better again. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1635.34s)]
*  I'm not talking about extreme pathology here. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1636.54s)]
*  I'm talking about, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1638.7s)]
*  someone cuts them off in traffic and they're pissed, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1640.98s)]
*  but then they're fine. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1642.78s)]
*  They're very, very happy about something they see. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1644.38s)]
*  So it doesn't always have to be negative. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1646.42s)]
*  But then they're kind of like flat affect, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1648.14s)]
*  and then they're into something negative. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1649.6200000000001s)]
*  I think that experience of emotions [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1651.38s)]
*  is so far and away different [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1655.02s)]
*  from the experience of emotions emitted from somebody who, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1656.82s)]
*  you can kind of see the emotion coming. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1661.7s)]
*  It's like a slow swell. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1663.34s)]
*  It's like a expansion and then a contraction again, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1664.78s)]
*  that you have time. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1668.74s)]
*  And I feel like, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1670.54s)]
*  I keep coming back to this theme of time perception. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1671.3799999999999s)]
*  Anytime we have time or we hear about [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1674.02s)]
*  like in all the Buddhist traditions, like space, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1675.62s)]
*  like you're trying to create mental space [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1678.34s)]
*  and this gap between stimulus and response, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1679.86s)]
*  it all sounds great, but with some people, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1682.34s)]
*  you have to really be on your toes [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1684.66s)]
*  or perhaps you disengage. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1687.3000000000002s)]
*  And so I've never heard a satisfying answer to this, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1689.26s)]
*  probably because I've never asked it out loud. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1692.02s)]
*  If you're a kid or if you're a parent [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1696.0600000000002s)]
*  and somebody is experiencing something, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1697.9s)]
*  let's say they're really angry or really happy, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1700.38s)]
*  you can imagine riding that wave in with them. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1704.66s)]
*  You could also imagine sitting back from it. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1706.8200000000002s)]
*  And some of this is probably what we'd call temperament, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1708.8200000000002s)]
*  but maybe you could talk about this a little bit [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1711.46s)]
*  in the context of having one or both parents [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1715.26s)]
*  that's kind of like a high frequency shifts [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1716.26s)]
*  between emotions versus kind of a slow expansion [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1718.8600000000001s)]
*  and then settling of emotions. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1721.8600000000001s)]
*  Because I feel like those are two completely different [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1724.3400000000001s)]
*  experiences of life. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1727.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1728.38s)]
*  I mean, I think you're speaking to how differently [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1729.3000000000002s)]
*  we feel emotions. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1732.3000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I think about one of my kids [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1733.46s)]
*  who I call a deeply feeling kid, right? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1735.54s)]
*  So my image is always, she's just more porous to the world. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1738.02s)]
*  And so if you think about someone who's more porous, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1741.46s)]
*  that their pores are literally wider, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1744.74s)]
*  a lot more is gonna come in. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1746.34s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1748.4199999999998s)]
*  A lot more is gonna come out, right? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1749.5s)]
*  And she's a kid who, by the way, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1751.6999999999998s)]
*  you're in a certain area in New York City. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1755.58s)]
*  She's like, I can't be here, the smell. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1757.58s)]
*  For me, I'm wired differently. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1759.86s)]
*  I was like, I literally don't smell anything different. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1762.2199999999998s)]
*  No, does that mean she's wrong? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1764.4599999999998s)]
*  No, I actually bet knowing her, she smells things. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1765.8999999999999s)]
*  And then she lets me know how awful it is [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1769.4199999999998s)]
*  and she can't stand on that corner. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1771.4599999999998s)]
*  And for me, in that moment at least, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1773.06s)]
*  cause we're probably all volatile in different ways, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1775.1s)]
*  I look steady as a rock, right? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1777.74s)]
*  I have another kid who, yeah, is pretty steady [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1780.5s)]
*  until he feels like his authority and power is threatened [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1784.7s)]
*  and then he better watch out, you know? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1789.22s)]
*  And so in one moment, someone might see him as, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1791.82s)]
*  oh, wow, that kid's really volatile. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1794.26s)]
*  But in probably 90% of other moments, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1795.74s)]
*  he's kind of cool as a cucumber. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1798.98s)]
*  So I also think it's important to categorize kids [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1800.82s)]
*  not as like always one way or another, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1803.8999999999999s)]
*  but we all feel emotions differently. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1806.3s)]
*  None of them is wrong or right. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1808.7s)]
*  To me, the goal is to not be locked into any one thing. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1810.34s)]
*  That to me, rigidity is always the enemy. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1817.1399999999999s)]
*  That's what holds us back in adulthood. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1820.1s)]
*  If we're always one way, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1821.86s)]
*  I can never handle someone cutting me off in traffic [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1823.78s)]
*  because the emotion takes me over and I have road rage. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1826.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's not good. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1828.8999999999999s)]
*  That's a very rigid, limited way of living life, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1829.74s)]
*  but it's probably also limiting to say, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1832.42s)]
*  I've never really gotten riled up about anything. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1834.94s)]
*  Forget road rage, but it's kind of amazing [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1836.86s)]
*  to get riled up once in a while [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1838.98s)]
*  and to feel really passionately about something [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1840.22s)]
*  and to feel something enough [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1842.1s)]
*  that you wanna go do something about it, right? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1843.42s)]
*  So there's no morality on it. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1845.6200000000001s)]
*  I think what's tricky, I can even say, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1847.9s)]
*  as a parent of three kids, is each of my kids, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1849.58s)]
*  I always kind of imagine this, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1853.3s)]
*  if I have all these different parts of me, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1854.9s)]
*  they each need a different part of me [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1856.86s)]
*  to kind of lead. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1860.5800000000002s)]
*  Like, they almost need different lead parents, right? [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1861.42s)]
*  So my kid who is my deeply feeling kid, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1864.3000000000002s)]
*  I know what's so important is that I believe her experience [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1867.26s)]
*  and I better be ready with certain boundaries [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1871.02s)]
*  because she feels things so intensely, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1873.1000000000001s)]
*  especially when she was younger. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1875.66s)]
*  I have to step in more often. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1876.66s)]
*  There's more difficult behavior, right? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1877.6200000000001s)]
*  My kid who's really, really steady, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1879.94s)]
*  I try to sometimes, even though it's convenient [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1883.02s)]
*  because he's so easy, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1885.8600000000001s)]
*  there's definitely a lot going on in there [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1887.3000000000002s)]
*  and sometimes I wonder, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1888.86s)]
*  does he almost feel like all the emotional space [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1890.9399999999998s)]
*  is taken up by his siblings [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1892.9399999999998s)]
*  and the only thing left for him is kind of steady as a rock [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1895.34s)]
*  and that can lead to a rigidity later in life, right? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1898.3799999999999s)]
*  So I think these are like moving systems. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1900.82s)]
*  So much of how we experience emotions growing up [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1903.4199999999998s)]
*  is also dictated by the system [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1907.6599999999999s)]
*  and kind of the roles our siblings play. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1909.6599999999999s)]
*  And so I don't know if that kind of gives you [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1914.3s)]
*  enough of an answer, but I think- [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1916.2199999999998s)]
*  That's informative. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1918.74s)]
*  Yeah, I think the thing I'd really want parents to know [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1919.58s)]
*  is I think we place a lot of morality on it [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1921.3799999999999s)]
*  and if we're honest with ourselves, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1923.26s)]
*  we're probably just comparing our kid to how we do things. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1924.54s)]
*  So if you're someone who's pretty steady, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1927.18s)]
*  you're like, my kid is crazy, they're dramatic, right? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1929.46s)]
*  If you're someone who's a little more out there, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1932.1s)]
*  you're not as bothered by that kid [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1934.06s)]
*  and then you have another kid, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1935.74s)]
*  you're like, that kid's kind of boring, right? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1936.58s)]
*  Because they're so flat. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1938.18s)]
*  And so, I mean, I think this is true in couples too. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1939.3s)]
*  Whenever we're fighting, we're probably just saying, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1941.78s)]
*  why can't you be more like me? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1943.3s)]
*  When we're triggered by our kid, we're like, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1944.66s)]
*  why can't you be more like me? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1946.02s)]
*  That's probably what we're always saying to each other, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1947.58s)]
*  going back to communication. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1949.26s)]
*  But if you take a little different perspective of, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1950.9s)]
*  hold on a second, there's no wrong or right way [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1953.58s)]
*  to feel emotions. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1956.3s)]
*  Some behaviors are not allowed, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1957.58s)]
*  but all the emotions have information. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1959.38s)]
*  And what might my kid need right now [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1961.78s)]
*  instead of, oh my goodness, is my kid messed up [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1964.5s)]
*  or why is my kid not just a little bit more like me? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1967.66s)]
*  How useful is it to talk to kids about emotions [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1971.58s)]
*  when they're not happening? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1974.38s)]
*  I mean, to me, this is something like, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1976.3s)]
*  I always just say, I always phrase it as emotion talk, right? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1978.62s)]
*  Just knowing that emotions live within you, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1981.78s)]
*  knowing that there's names for them, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1986.78s)]
*  that they're normal, that they make sense. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1989.06s)]
*  To me, it's like the ultimate leg up in life. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1992.22s)]
*  Like, it gives your kids such resilience [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1995.02s)]
*  because we can't beat our emotions. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=1997.98s)]
*  I feel like we've been trying that for generations. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2001.86s)]
*  Like, if I just only didn't feel so angry [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2004.42s)]
*  or so jealous or so sad, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2006.78s)]
*  our emotions are so primal in our body. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2009.5800000000002s)]
*  And I really do believe emotions, they're information. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2012.22s)]
*  That's what they are. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2015.54s)]
*  Why would we ever want to not get the information [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2017.3000000000002s)]
*  our body is giving us? [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2020.6200000000001s)]
*  And sometimes it's almost dramatic what happens [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2022.38s)]
*  in an amazing way. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2024.8200000000002s)]
*  So many people, I think about so many times [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2026.14s)]
*  I have people in a room for therapy, they start crying. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2027.94s)]
*  I'm so sorry. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2030.74s)]
*  You're feeling something so intensely [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2032.5s)]
*  that your body is producing water from your eyes [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2035.1399999999999s)]
*  to get your attention. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2038.22s)]
*  Like, that must be really important information. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2039.26s)]
*  Why are we saying sorry? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2043.1799999999998s)]
*  And as far as we know, a uniquely human thing. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2044.54s)]
*  I could be wrong about this, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2047.8999999999999s)]
*  but a colleague of mine at Stanford and psychiatrist, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2049.1s)]
*  Carl Dysaroff, talked about this, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2053.2999999999997s)]
*  that humans are the only species that we are aware of [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2056.62s)]
*  that sheds tears for sake of emotion. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2060.38s)]
*  Other animals, they have lacrimal glands, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2064.1800000000003s)]
*  they produce water, so to speak, salty water [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2065.86s)]
*  that comes out of their eye region, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2068.82s)]
*  but not as it relates to emotions. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2070.78s)]
*  At least we don't think so. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2073.06s)]
*  So that's a great example. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2074.7000000000003s)]
*  Like I even think about a conversation [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2076.1800000000003s)]
*  I have had with my kids. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2077.46s)]
*  And I like to just have these moments here and there. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2078.58s)]
*  Whenever I talk about good conversations with my kids, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2081.1800000000003s)]
*  I think people think I have these 45 minute, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2083.1800000000003s)]
*  no, they're usually 10 seconds. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2085.5s)]
*  I say one thing, my kids say, can I have a snack now? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2087.34s)]
*  And I think that's a great conversation [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2089.7799999999997s)]
*  because I know it gets in there. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2091.18s)]
*  Do you know that tears have really important information [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2093.8199999999997s)]
*  for us? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2097.5s)]
*  I can be like, what, what'd you say? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2098.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm just thinking, so many people think tears are bad. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2100.14s)]
*  Tears are kind of amazing. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2102.2599999999998s)]
*  It's like our body is trying to stop us [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2103.58s)]
*  and it's like asking us to pay attention [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2105.3799999999997s)]
*  to something really powerful. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2107.9799999999996s)]
*  I just think it's kind of an amazing thing. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2110.22s)]
*  Our body does. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2112.14s)]
*  And my kid goes, can I have pretzels? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2113.62s)]
*  Oh, sure, I'll get you pretzels. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2115.58s)]
*  That to me is a win. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2117.3399999999997s)]
*  I just want to tell everyone. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2118.3399999999997s)]
*  That is a 10 out of 10. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2119.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm bragging to people about that. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2121.06s)]
*  I'm like, I had the best conversation [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2122.78s)]
*  because I know this is seeping in. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2125.7000000000003s)]
*  Because in the moment my kid is crying, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2130.02s)]
*  you think it's going to be helpful [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2133.06s)]
*  when my seven year old is crying, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2134.2200000000003s)]
*  tears are amazing. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2135.9s)]
*  They're like, F you, mom. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2137.3s)]
*  No one wants to hear that. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2139.1400000000003s)]
*  My reflex would be to tell them the biology of tears. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2140.1400000000003s)]
*  Noam Sobel, who was on the podcast, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2142.7000000000003s)]
*  told us that tears contain hormones [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2144.1800000000003s)]
*  that signal to other people, pheromones, excuse me, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2145.6600000000003s)]
*  that literally change the biology [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2148.14s)]
*  of the people around you. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2149.8199999999997s)]
*  We can actually smell tears. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2150.8599999999997s)]
*  We don't realize we're doing it. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2152.3799999999997s)]
*  See, here I go. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2153.7s)]
*  So I realize I spend enough time with kids [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2154.54s)]
*  that if you tell them that, they're like, whatever. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2157.2999999999997s)]
*  But you know when that's a great conversation? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2160.18s)]
*  Around the dinner table. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2162.42s)]
*  And again, your kids will roll their eyes. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2163.2599999999998s)]
*  Kids roll their eyes about everything. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2165.02s)]
*  I always think rolling their eyes or stop [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2166.14s)]
*  is kind of a kid's way of saying, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2168.3399999999997s)]
*  there's a lot coming at me on my own person. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2170.58s)]
*  I just need to push it away a little [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2173.1s)]
*  so that on my own time and under my own control, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2175.62s)]
*  I can take it in. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2179.5s)]
*  And we take eye rolls or whatever it is so personally [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2180.58s)]
*  that then we end up getting into a parachute, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2183.1s)]
*  we'll go, why are you rolling my eyes? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2184.46s)]
*  And we miss this opportunity. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2185.58s)]
*  If we just say nothing then, our kid is gonna take in [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2187.1s)]
*  what we just said, just walk away. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2189.2599999999998s)]
*  Let the whole process happen. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2190.9s)]
*  It's kind of like if your boss comes in [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2192.7s)]
*  and says something like, oh look, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2194.2999999999997s)]
*  that project really wasn't as good as it could have been. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2196.5s)]
*  And I really need these things done. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2199.2999999999997s)]
*  And you're like, oh. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2201.1s)]
*  And then imagine, you're rolling your eyes at me. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2202.66s)]
*  If your boss just leaves the room, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2204.34s)]
*  you probably think, I didn't do that as well as I could. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2206.3s)]
*  I'm gonna go work on it. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2210.86s)]
*  So I feel like not taking the bait [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2212.2200000000003s)]
*  is a very important parenting tool. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2214.6200000000003s)]
*  But I think those moments with our kids [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2216.5s)]
*  to talk about emotions and to talk about our own, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2218.2200000000003s)]
*  especially when it comes to struggle. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2222.34s)]
*  One of the things I think a lot about, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2226.46s)]
*  I try to be intentional with my kids, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2227.86s)]
*  especially when they're younger. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2229.7400000000002s)]
*  I just think kids are flooded by their parents' capability. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2230.7799999999997s)]
*  And it is so hard to learn in environments [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2236.3799999999997s)]
*  where someone's capability is so far beyond your own. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2240.06s)]
*  Like I'm not a good cook, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2245.1s)]
*  but if I was really learning to cook, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2246.4599999999996s)]
*  I would wanna learn from someone from here or there, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2249.74s)]
*  burnt some garlic or messed up the broccoli. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2252.5s)]
*  And then it was like, okay, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2255.5s)]
*  well I guess I could do this next time. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2256.62s)]
*  I'd be like, okay. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2258.1s)]
*  But if I'm learning to cook from someone who is [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2259.06s)]
*  whatever celebrity chef, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2262.94s)]
*  I don't know, that person's like way too far from me. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2264.9s)]
*  And I almost feel shame. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2267.58s)]
*  So I think about this with our kids [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2269.46s)]
*  and how this relates to emotions. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2270.94s)]
*  Where when your kids are younger, especially, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2272.42s)]
*  if you just think about the first 10 minutes of their day, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2274.74s)]
*  like they're trying to figure out [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2277.5s)]
*  maybe how to brush their teeth, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2278.5s)]
*  how to go to the bathroom, how to turn on the sink, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2279.58s)]
*  how to wash their hands. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2281.46s)]
*  They always put their shirt on the wrong way. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2282.42s)]
*  They can't get on their socks. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2284.54s)]
*  There's so many things. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2285.7799999999997s)]
*  And you come out dressed perfectly. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2286.74s)]
*  And then I can't get on my socks. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2288.9799999999996s)]
*  And you go like this, okay, one, two. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2290.4599999999996s)]
*  And kind of in those moments, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2292.3399999999997s)]
*  I always think that's, I'm just kind of saying to my kid, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2294.4599999999996s)]
*  I can do everything easily. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2296.66s)]
*  And they don't know our history. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2297.8199999999997s)]
*  They don't know. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2299.8599999999997s)]
*  We struggled to put on socks for five years too. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2301.2599999999998s)]
*  I put on my shirt backward until college. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2303.8199999999997s)]
*  They don't know that. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2306.14s)]
*  And so I think again, in these calm moments, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2307.06s)]
*  you have this opportunity to say something like, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2309.74s)]
*  I cannot finish this crossword puzzle. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2313.74s)]
*  Or like, I love New York Times games, right? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2317.3799999999997s)]
*  And it's so fun with my kids now that they're older, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2319.7s)]
*  but my connections was really hard today. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2322.5s)]
*  I just, I really struggled with it. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2324.8599999999997s)]
*  And then I was like, oh, I can't do it. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2326.3799999999997s)]
*  I can't do it. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2327.7799999999997s)]
*  And then I took a deep breath [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2328.62s)]
*  and I tried it a little more. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2330.22s)]
*  And maybe I said, and I did it, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2332.02s)]
*  or I didn't do it, whatever it is. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2333.8999999999996s)]
*  And it gives my kid, first of all, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2336.14s)]
*  it gives my kid an opportunity [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2337.54s)]
*  to just notice that I struggle too. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2338.7s)]
*  It gives my kid again, kind of an arc and a story of, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2341.26s)]
*  oh, someone I admire so much. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2344.7000000000003s)]
*  Every kid admires their parents. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2346.9s)]
*  They've had hard times. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2348.6600000000003s)]
*  They still have hard times. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2349.78s)]
*  They work through things. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2351.3s)]
*  They burn garlic. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2352.34s)]
*  They can kind of talk themselves through it. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2353.38s)]
*  That is such a more powerful kind of lesson [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2356.5400000000004s)]
*  in emotion regulation than teaching your kid [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2359.82s)]
*  kind of directly. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2363.9s)]
*  Yeah, it also seems that here we're not defining [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2365.6200000000003s)]
*  the age of the kids, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2369.1400000000003s)]
*  but if one presents themselves as perfect or close to it [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2369.98s)]
*  in any kind of relationship, work, romantic, parenting, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2374.42s)]
*  et cetera, sooner or later, you're gonna fall from grace [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2377.9s)]
*  because they're either gonna be looking for the mistake [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2382.3s)]
*  or the moment you make a mistake, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2385.58s)]
*  it's gonna be this fracture in the picture [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2386.58s)]
*  that people had of you. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2388.38s)]
*  And I have to say, and I think some people [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2390.42s)]
*  might get irritated or even, dare I say, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2393.78s)]
*  triggered by the language I'm about to use. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2396.5s)]
*  But I feel like the real ninja move in all of this [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2398.9s)]
*  is to acknowledge that there are power dynamics [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2404.54s)]
*  between parent and child, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2407.7000000000003s)]
*  but then to try and dissolve the power dynamics. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2408.9s)]
*  And I say this in the context of having run a lab [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2411.62s)]
*  for a long time, which is very different [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2413.62s)]
*  than raising small children, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2414.9s)]
*  but you have people who are coming into your laboratory, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2416.02s)]
*  they are, if they're your graduate student or postdoc, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2418.62s)]
*  they're staking their whole career [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2421.46s)]
*  on your ability to teach and mentor. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2422.9s)]
*  And a lot is at stake. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2425.58s)]
*  Nothing is for certain. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2426.82s)]
*  They might not get a job, the papers might not work out, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2427.86s)]
*  and so there's just so much tension around it. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2430.98s)]
*  And so as a PI, as a principal investigator in a lab, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2435.06s)]
*  I remember feeling that pressure of like, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2437.54s)]
*  it's gotta work out. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2439.42s)]
*  And one of the best things that ever happened to me [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2440.82s)]
*  as a graduate student was that my first paper [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2444.06s)]
*  took forever to get accepted. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2446.02s)]
*  And we almost got in and then it didn't get in, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2448.5s)]
*  and then finally it got in, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2450.54s)]
*  such that every paper after that felt like a breeze [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2451.7400000000002s)]
*  because it took so damn long the first time. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2455.1400000000003s)]
*  And I got to see that my advisor [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2457.3s)]
*  couldn't like make magic happen. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2459.94s)]
*  And fortunately, that's the way [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2462.7400000000002s)]
*  the scientific process is supposed to work. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2464.38s)]
*  And I think about this in the context of parenting, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2466.2200000000003s)]
*  like if you're seen as invincible, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2468.38s)]
*  you know, we hear about this, like people say, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2471.2200000000003s)]
*  I thought my dad was Superman. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2472.54s)]
*  I thought my mom was Superwoman, you know? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2474.38s)]
*  But you can imagine how disappointing it must be [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2477.02s)]
*  when they discover anything about a lack of capacity [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2480.5800000000004s)]
*  or a break in emotional stability, et cetera. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2484.1000000000004s)]
*  So how does one present themselves as both powerful [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2487.5s)]
*  in the positive sense of the word, such a thorny word, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2491.5400000000004s)]
*  but powerful in the positive sense of the word, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2494.9s)]
*  but human and vulnerable to making mistakes [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2496.9s)]
*  in a way that you don't give up the essential, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2500.7400000000002s)]
*  let's just call it what it is, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2504.6200000000003s)]
*  a power dynamic with your kids [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2505.9s)]
*  so that the kid then doesn't feel they have to parent you. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2507.1800000000003s)]
*  I love this topic because it's so interesting. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2509.5400000000004s)]
*  Right now, it's kind of review season at Good Inside [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2511.9s)]
*  because I also am the CEO of a company. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2514.94s)]
*  And to me, the things I talk about with parenting [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2516.94s)]
*  and my kids and for other people parenting their kids, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2519.94s)]
*  they are the exact same principles, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2523.54s)]
*  exact as leading a team. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2525.54s)]
*  And so when I think about review season [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2528.34s)]
*  and the way we get feedback and the right, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2530.6600000000003s)]
*  and back and forth, it brings us all together [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2532.7400000000002s)]
*  and I'll explain. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2535.7400000000002s)]
*  So the other day I said to my kids, I love resolutions. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2536.58s)]
*  I actually do love resolutions, right? [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2541.7799999999997s)]
*  Because I love just the opportunity to say, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2543.7s)]
*  what is one small thing? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2546.14s)]
*  I'm like, I value and I'm gonna hold myself accountable [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2547.7799999999997s)]
*  to do. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2551.14s)]
*  What I said to my kids was, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2551.98s)]
*  I want you to come up with one thing, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2554.14s)]
*  just one thing for now. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2557.02s)]
*  And it has to be something like manageable and real [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2558.34s)]
*  that I could do that would really make me a better mom to you. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2561.8199999999997s)]
*  You asked your kids this? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2566.58s)]
*  I asked my kids this. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2567.42s)]
*  I actually asked my kids this relatively frequently. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2568.2599999999998s)]
*  It's like a review, right? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2570.7s)]
*  Because it's something I do at work all the time. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2573.2599999999998s)]
*  And what I say at work is, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2574.74s)]
*  cause often my direct reports say nothing. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2576.2599999999998s)]
*  I said, I just wanna tell you something. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2578.7s)]
*  I need one thing from you by the end of the day. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2580.94s)]
*  I need it. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2584.8599999999997s)]
*  Because like, I know, I know I can get hot. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2585.68s)]
*  I know I can get a little reactive, right? [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2589.14s)]
*  I know I'm always go, go, go. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2592.22s)]
*  And there probably is a moment that I need to pause. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2594.02s)]
*  I know, I know I have a lot of issues. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2596.8199999999997s)]
*  So if you don't tell me one thing, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2598.98s)]
*  I don't trust you as much. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2600.7s)]
*  So here's what happened with my kids. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2602.62s)]
*  At that point, it was only two of them. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2603.86s)]
*  It just happened the other day. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2605.26s)]
*  My son says, my seven year old son, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2606.7400000000002s)]
*  sometimes when you're trying to get some work done at home [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2611.02s)]
*  and I wanna get your attention for something, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2614.3s)]
*  this is what you do, mom. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2616.14s)]
*  One minute, one minute, one minute. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2618.14s)]
*  And then you still don't give me full attention. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2621.26s)]
*  He's clocking. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2623.9s)]
*  I'd rather you tell me five minutes [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2624.7400000000002s)]
*  and then give me your full attention. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2628.02s)]
*  That's literally what I, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2629.98s)]
*  I was just like, that is a really good suggestion. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2631.3s)]
*  And I really needed to hear that. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2635.9s)]
*  I can do that. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2638.74s)]
*  This was a couple of days ago. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2640.58s)]
*  Okay, I have to admit, two days ago, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2642.02s)]
*  he was trying to show me something. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2647.22s)]
*  And he just goes, you're doing it. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2649.1s)]
*  You're not really giving me your attention. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2651.2599999999998s)]
*  And I said, you're right. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2653.66s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2655.06s)]
*  Change is hard. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2656.1s)]
*  I actually do need about two minutes. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2657.98s)]
*  Is that okay? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2660.22s)]
*  And then I'll put my computer down [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2661.06s)]
*  because I'll sometimes look at him and like, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2662.62s)]
*  kinda look at, you know. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2663.86s)]
*  And he goes, okay. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2664.78s)]
*  It was kind of, it was so beautiful. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2665.86s)]
*  My daughter said, at night, she goes, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2667.9s)]
*  it's so interesting when you give people this opportunity, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2672.22s)]
*  how generous they can be with you. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2674.14s)]
*  I think it's been true at work and home. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2676.18s)]
*  My daughter goes, I know when it's my bedtime at night, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2677.74s)]
*  I always wanna do one or two extra things. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2680.7s)]
*  I know. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2682.62s)]
*  I always have to get my water. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2683.5s)]
*  It's just how I am. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2685.3s)]
*  That's what she said. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2686.54s)]
*  And you get this rushing voice and you go, come on. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2687.82s)]
*  It's bedtime. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2691.46s)]
*  And that's like the last voice I hear before bed. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2692.42s)]
*  And I really don't like that voice. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2696.66s)]
*  And so can you just know that I always need to do [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2698.7s)]
*  those one or two extra things and not use that voice? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2700.9s)]
*  And I said, you know what? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2705.9s)]
*  I wouldn't wanna hear that as the last voice. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2707.98s)]
*  You know, and I think at night especially [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2710.46s)]
*  is a little digression. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2711.82s)]
*  I always feel like I'm in a rush. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2714.18s)]
*  I don't know, an extra two minutes with my kids, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2717.1000000000004s)]
*  like my kids are getting older. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2718.7000000000003s)]
*  They're not even in my house for that much longer. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2719.82s)]
*  I just have to remind myself, I'm not in a rush. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2721.82s)]
*  Like this is the best use of my time. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2723.82s)]
*  So I said, and that one I've been really good at. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2725.34s)]
*  And so how do we show our kids that we're fallible? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2728.0600000000004s)]
*  One way is actually like asking for feedback, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2732.54s)]
*  especially when you have older kids. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2736.82s)]
*  When you have a teenager, this is the number one thing [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2738.46s)]
*  that can change things around. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2742.3s)]
*  You know what I'm thinking about? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2743.86s)]
*  It's hard to be a teen. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2746.38s)]
*  And I'm definitely not a perfect parent of a teen. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2747.58s)]
*  I'm sure you have a long list, but for right now, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2751.2200000000003s)]
*  can you name one thing that I could do [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2754.98s)]
*  that would make me a better parent to you? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2758.34s)]
*  And I wanna follow this through [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2760.2200000000003s)]
*  because what a lot of teens will do, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2761.1400000000003s)]
*  or parents will say, my teenager tells me something [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2762.2200000000003s)]
*  ridiculous. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2765.78s)]
*  They'll say, well, you know how you make me charge my phone [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2767.06s)]
*  at nine or 10 p.m. out of the room? [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2771.1400000000003s)]
*  You could let me sleep with my phone, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2772.9s)]
*  which maybe is parent like, I'm just not gonna do that. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2774.3s)]
*  Or they'll say, you know what you could do? [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2775.98s)]
*  You could give me a thousand dollars every week [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2777.6600000000003s)]
*  for an allowance, right? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2779.5s)]
*  And so parents will say, my kid doesn't take it seriously. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2780.94s)]
*  This is where like to me, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2783.3s)]
*  one of the most important life skills, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2784.5s)]
*  parenting, management, friendships, it doesn't matter, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2786.5800000000004s)]
*  is differentiating someone's words on the surface [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2790.46s)]
*  from their needs or their feelings or their fears, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2793.7400000000002s)]
*  whatever it is underneath, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2797.1800000000003s)]
*  and not responding to the words, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2799.2200000000003s)]
*  but kind of cutting onto them. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2801.38s)]
*  Let's even say, I can say the phone thing. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2803.42s)]
*  What would be so great about having your phone? [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2808.02s)]
*  Just help me understand it. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2809.54s)]
*  I know in my head, I'm never gonna do it, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2810.7400000000002s)]
*  but we don't realize just cause we're not gonna do something [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2812.26s)]
*  someone asks, it doesn't mean we don't owe that person [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2815.58s)]
*  the right to try to understand why they want it, right? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2818.1800000000003s)]
*  So I might just ask questions. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2821.42s)]
*  It might probably end with, look, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2822.58s)]
*  I actually hear what you're saying. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2823.78s)]
*  All of your friends are on Instagram until midnight. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2824.86s)]
*  It sounds like you legitimately do miss out [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2827.98s)]
*  on conversations by the time you get to school, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2830.02s)]
*  you feel out of them. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2831.82s)]
*  I'm not even joking. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2832.8999999999996s)]
*  I feel like if I was your age, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2834.3799999999997s)]
*  I'd be like, that's basically the worst thing ever, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2835.4199999999996s)]
*  I believe you. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2837.14s)]
*  Having your phone after X time, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2838.9799999999996s)]
*  it's just one of my non-negotiables. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2840.66s)]
*  It's actually just cause I love you so much [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2842.74s)]
*  that I feel like my job is to protect you. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2844.58s)]
*  I wonder if there is some other way [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2846.8999999999996s)]
*  that we can figure that out. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2848.4199999999996s)]
*  Or my kid says $1,000. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2849.62s)]
*  I might say, what would you do with $1,000? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2851.02s)]
*  Oh, you wanna go to more concerts? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2853.2599999999998s)]
*  Oh, your friends all get more allowance. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2854.9399999999996s)]
*  Tell me more. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2856.2999999999997s)]
*  No matter what your kid says to you, there's information. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2857.14s)]
*  So I think feedback is one. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2859.7s)]
*  I think repair is another way. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2863.02s)]
*  Repair is the most important relationship strategy [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2865.1800000000003s)]
*  to get good at. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2868.1800000000003s)]
*  And I just hope everyone hears the duality in that [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2869.54s)]
*  and realizes what that means. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2872.5s)]
*  Because if you're gonna get good at repair, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2874.02s)]
*  you have to mess up. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2877.46s)]
*  The only way to repair is to mess up. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2879.1400000000003s)]
*  And so if I'm telling you get good at repair, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2882.3s)]
*  I am telling you, you have to accomplish step one, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2885.1800000000003s)]
*  which is yelling at your kid. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2888.1s)]
*  You have to. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2889.94s)]
*  And you're gonna do it anyway. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2890.9s)]
*  I do it. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2891.82s)]
*  But if you then tell yourself, wait, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2892.82s)]
*  I'm getting good at repair, step one is messing up, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2894.5800000000004s)]
*  I crushed it, amazing, I'm half the way there. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2897.82s)]
*  Then when you repair, which is when you take ownership, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2900.1400000000003s)]
*  hey, I'm sorry, I yelled. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2902.86s)]
*  Just like you, I'm managing my emotions. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2905.1400000000003s)]
*  Emotions are really tricky. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2908.26s)]
*  Emotions are really hard. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2909.98s)]
*  And do you know what? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2911.5400000000004s)]
*  Even though you're gonna have a leg up on this [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2913.1000000000004s)]
*  compared to most people when they're adults, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2915.02s)]
*  because you're learning how to regulate emotions, [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2916.7400000000002s)]
*  you're still gonna be practicing that when you're my age. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2918.7400000000002s)]
*  That is my responsibility to work on. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2922.62s)]
*  It's not your fault. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2923.98s)]
*  And I love you. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2925.62s)]
*  So powerful. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2927.02s)]
*  I'd like to take a quick break [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2929.5s)]
*  and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2930.74s)]
*  AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2933.3399999999997s)]
*  that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2935.9399999999996s)]
*  AG1 is designed to cover all of your foundational [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2939.02s)]
*  nutritional needs and it tastes great. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2941.54s)]
*  Now I've been drinking AG1 since 2012. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2943.7s)]
*  And I started doing that at a time when my budget [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2946.4199999999996s)]
*  for supplements was really limited. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2948.5s)]
*  In fact, I only had enough money back then [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2950.38s)]
*  to purchase one supplement. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2952.2200000000003s)]
*  And I'm so glad that I made that supplement, AG1. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2953.54s)]
*  The reason for that is even though I strive to eat [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2956.58s)]
*  most of my foods from whole foods [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2959.02s)]
*  and minimally processed foods, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2960.6600000000003s)]
*  it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2962.5s)]
*  vegetables, vitamins and minerals, micronutrients [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2964.46s)]
*  and adaptogens from food alone. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2967.1400000000003s)]
*  And I need to do that in order to ensure [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2969.34s)]
*  that I have enough energy throughout the day, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2971.3s)]
*  I sleep well at night and keep my immune system strong. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2973.1s)]
*  But when I take AG1 daily, I find that all aspects [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2976.54s)]
*  of my health, my physical health, my mental health [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2979.22s)]
*  and my performance, both cognitive and physical are better. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2981.4199999999996s)]
*  I know that because I've had lapses when I didn't take AG1 [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2984.5s)]
*  and I certainly felt the difference. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2987.2999999999997s)]
*  I also noticed and this makes perfect sense [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2989.18s)]
*  given the relationship between the gut microbiome [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2991.22s)]
*  and the brain, that when I regularly take AG1, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2993.2599999999998s)]
*  which for me means a serving in the morning or mid morning [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2995.8199999999997s)]
*  and again, later in the afternoon or evening, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=2998.22s)]
*  that I have more mental clarity and more mental energy. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3000.3799999999997s)]

*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Juv. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3025.2999999999997s)]
*  Juv makes medical grade red light therapy devices. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3028.2599999999998s)]
*  Now, if there's one thing that I have consistently emphasized [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3031.2599999999998s)]
*  on this podcast, it's the incredible impact [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3033.54s)]
*  that light can have on our biology. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3036.02s)]
*  Now, in addition to sunlight, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3038.3s)]
*  red light and near infrared light have been shown [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3039.66s)]
*  to have positive effects on improving numerous aspects [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3041.78s)]
*  of cellular and organ health, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3044.44s)]
*  including faster muscle recovery, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3046.02s)]
*  improved skin health and wound healing, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3047.74s)]
*  improvements in acne, meaning reductions in acne, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3049.82s)]
*  reduced pain and inflammation, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3052.58s)]
*  improved mitochondrial function [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3053.98s)]
*  and even improving visual function itself. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3055.34s)]
*  What sets Juv lights apart [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3057.98s)]
*  and why they're my preferred red light therapy device [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3059.3s)]
*  is that they use clinically proven wavelengths, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3061.5s)]
*  meaning specific wavelengths of red light [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3063.7s)]
*  and near infrared light in specific combinations [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3066.02s)]
*  to trigger the optimal cellular adaptations. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3068.5s)]
*  Personally, I use the Juv whole body panel [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3071.18s)]
*  about three to four times per week, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3073.06s)]
*  typically in the morning, but sometimes in the afternoon. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3074.7s)]
*  And I use the Juv handheld light [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3077.1s)]
*  both at home and when I travel. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3078.98s)]

*  I love, love, love this thing about asking for a request. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3099.7799999999997s)]
*  It's different than asking for feedback, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3104.8799999999997s)]
*  which could quickly lead to a list of all the things [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3107.2s)]
*  that one does wrong as opposed to a request [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3109.7799999999997s)]
*  for how one could do better. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3112.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3113.54s)]
*  I think there's an important distinction there. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3114.3799999999997s)]
*  And then it seems that the question that the parent [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3115.8599999999997s)]
*  or who knows the boss or whatever, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3118.4599999999996s)]
*  maybe it's with a romantic partner, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3120.7s)]
*  needs to ask themselves is, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3122.26s)]
*  what is this request really about? [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3125.3s)]
*  Like what's underneath it? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3128.6200000000003s)]
*  I'm just paraphrasing essentially what you said. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3130.3s)]
*  And what's it really about? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3133.0200000000004s)]
*  Is it a request for more autonomy, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3133.98s)]
*  for more social connection with other people? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3136.84s)]
*  And then one starts to realize it, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3138.82s)]
*  and certainly in this example that you gave [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3140.78s)]
*  of a child asking for more time with their phone [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3143.5800000000004s)]
*  late at night is that it actually has nothing to do [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3146.5200000000004s)]
*  with your relationship to them. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3148.78s)]
*  It's really about their relationship to their friends. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3150.1400000000003s)]
*  And the fact that they might feel [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3152.7s)]
*  as if they're missing out. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3154.2599999999998s)]
*  And that leads me to another question, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3156.06s)]
*  which is what if you as the parent, partner, boss, et cetera, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3158.7s)]
*  keep your phone close to you until midnight? [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3164.7s)]
*  And they know that. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3167.32s)]
*  So one of the worst things that I believe anyone can say [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3168.54s)]
*  is do as I say, not as I do. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3172.06s)]
*  It's just such a blatantly arrogant stance [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3174.14s)]
*  of you're supposed to do what I say because I say so, [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3177.78s)]
*  but I'm not gonna do it because I don't want to. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3182.5800000000004s)]
*  And yet there are times like in parent-child relationships [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3184.42s)]
*  or boss-employee relationships [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3187.2200000000003s)]
*  where you're telling somebody to do something [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3189.1000000000004s)]
*  and you yourself are not going to do it [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3191.94s)]
*  or no longer do it or choose not to do it. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3193.98s)]
*  And in reality, you don't have to. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3195.94s)]
*  And maybe there's a good reason why you don't [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3199.2200000000003s)]
*  or don't have to. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3201.1400000000003s)]
*  That's the nature of, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3202.02s)]
*  that's why I use these words, power dynamics, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3202.86s)]
*  which everyone hears and goes, oh boy, here we go. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3206.82s)]
*  But it is an issue of power dynamics. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3209.1800000000003s)]
*  You have more power than the kid. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3210.98s)]
*  So what you're doing is you're giving the kid power [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3214.26s)]
*  to express where they want more agency. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3216.14s)]
*  I like the word maybe agency more than power. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3219.1s)]
*  Did you grant your son the right to use his phone [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3223.18s)]
*  later into the evening? [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3226.86s)]
*  Not to pry into your personal personal. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3227.78s)]
*  My son did not ask me that. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3229.62s)]
*  And he knows that our phone rules are non-negotiable. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3231.06s)]
*  I didn't mean to pry into your family dynamics. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3233.54s)]
*  But that kid, if that's a rule, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3235.9s)]
*  you would never give it to them. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3237.22s)]
*  But I think so many times, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3238.5s)]
*  and then we'll get back to power. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3239.94s)]
*  We shouldn't be afraid to learn more. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3243.34s)]
*  I actually just think that's what it is. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3246.02s)]
*  Our kid says, oh, my friends get this. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3248.1800000000003s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3250.38s)]
*  Why don't you just learn more? [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3251.2200000000003s)]
*  Oh, they do? [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3252.04s)]
*  It's like learning more about what someone says [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3252.88s)]
*  doesn't mean you ever have to change your boundary. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3256.7400000000002s)]
*  Most of conflict is about a lack of understanding anyway. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3259.6600000000003s)]
*  When you learn more, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3262.34s)]
*  you're trying to understand, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3263.7400000000002s)]
*  understand your kid, understand your, [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3265.58s)]
*  someone wants to raise and you think it's ridiculous. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3267.86s)]
*  You can learn more. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3269.94s)]
*  Tell me what's been going on. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3271.6600000000003s)]
*  What have you been doing? [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3272.6600000000003s)]
*  Learning more about someone's position [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3274.42s)]
*  does not weaken your position. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3276.56s)]
*  And I think that's really, really important [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3279.1200000000003s)]
*  in any form of leadership. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3280.82s)]
*  Now, in terms of the power dynamics, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3283.0800000000004s)]
*  there is something about the word power that like, you know? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3285.7000000000003s)]
*  Is that weird? [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3287.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3288.5s)]
*  I mean, I think the way I think about it [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3289.34s)]
*  and what we do at Good Insight a lot [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3291.1800000000003s)]
*  in terms of our leadership and parenting style, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3292.44s)]
*  I don't use the word power, [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3294.76s)]
*  but I think it's about embodying your authority. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3296.34s)]
*  Parents have authority. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3299.6600000000003s)]
*  Pilots have authority. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3301.54s)]
*  Bosses have authority because they're the ones [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3303.9s)]
*  kind of who have the job of setting up the whole system [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3307.2200000000003s)]
*  for success. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3309.82s)]
*  That's their job, right? [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3310.9s)]
*  My job isn't to make my kid happy. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3313.02s)]
*  My job is to help create the conditions [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3315.34s)]
*  for my kid to be like a real functioning, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3318.54s)]
*  confident adult. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3320.94s)]
*  That's what I believe, right? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3322.38s)]
*  A pilot's job is definitely not to keep passengers happy. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3323.54s)]
*  It's to get everyone safely on the ground. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3326.6s)]
*  A boss's job is not to keep everyone happy. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3328.16s)]
*  It's to set up the conditions [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3330.56s)]
*  for health and success of the business, right? [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3331.8s)]
*  Now, if you know that's your job, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3334.2200000000003s)]
*  it's no one else's job but the CEO. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3335.2s)]
*  I mean, to some degree, all the management, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3337.36s)]
*  but that is their job. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3338.7s)]
*  And so there's a difference where if the CEO believes [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3340.56s)]
*  a job needs to be done a certain way, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3343.76s)]
*  it's not that they have power. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3346.48s)]
*  It's just their role involves having that authority. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3347.96s)]
*  And if someone else disagrees, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3351.32s)]
*  it's up to them to say you can keep the job or not. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3352.8s)]
*  It's just you have different roles. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3355.0s)]
*  And I actually think owning that very outright, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3358.28s)]
*  it's actually something I recently said at work [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3361.0s)]
*  in a review around something I really wanted [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3363.88s)]
*  and kind of owned in my role as a CEO, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3366.8s)]
*  that is under my role to decide this is important. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3371.2s)]
*  And now we have to figure it out. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3375.12s)]
*  Let's see, I would love some input [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3376.22s)]
*  on how we're gonna get this done. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3377.72s)]
*  Same thing for a kid. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3379.28s)]
*  One of the lines I said over and over and over [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3380.92s)]
*  to my kid when they were younger, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3385.6800000000003s)]
*  and I see so many good inside parents [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3387.2000000000003s)]
*  tell me that their kids reflects back to them later, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3389.04s)]
*  is my number one job is to keep you safe. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3391.52s)]
*  So what does that mean? [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3394.8s)]
*  That kind of relates to power. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3395.64s)]
*  It can mean why am I not letting my kid, I don't know, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3396.92s)]
*  jump up and down on our kitchen counter? [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3401.46s)]
*  It's not because I'm pissed that my kid isn't listening. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3403.84s)]
*  I'm not letting them jump up and down [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3406.36s)]
*  on my kitchen counter where there's a light [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3408.28s)]
*  above their head because my number one job [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3409.64s)]
*  is to keep my kid safe. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3411.2799999999997s)]
*  Is that power? [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3414.96s)]
*  I mean, I guess, I think it's authority. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3415.7999999999997s)]
*  How would I embody that authority? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3417.12s)]
*  I would say, it looks hard for you to get down. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3418.7s)]
*  I'm about to pick you up and put you on the floor [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3420.8799999999997s)]
*  because I have authority, right? [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3423.6s)]
*  We get to this phone discussion, let's say, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3427.06s)]
*  and I really do believe that the phone has to be charged [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3429.68s)]
*  out of the room at a certain time. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3432.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm gonna understand, I'm gonna understand, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3434.48s)]
*  I'm gonna listen, hopefully I'm connected to my kid [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3435.8399999999997s)]
*  and they feel respected by me in a million ways [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3438.4s)]
*  and it might lead to me saying, look, my number one job [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3440.44s)]
*  still is to keep you safe and that really means [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3444.0800000000004s)]
*  making decisions that I really believe are good for you, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3446.92s)]
*  short term and long term, even if you're upset with me. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3449.7200000000003s)]
*  This is one of those times. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3452.6800000000003s)]
*  And so, I love you, this might be a point of conflict, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3455.1200000000003s)]
*  I know we're gonna get through this, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3458.6000000000004s)]
*  and that is my role as a parent. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3460.52s)]
*  And it comes from a place of wanting to protect you. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3463.52s)]
*  And I think when you embody your authority in that way, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3466.7999999999997s)]
*  kids never say thank you and they will roll their eyes. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3470.2799999999997s)]
*  And kids always feel loved and protected, they really do. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3473.64s)]
*  I hear it from my kids. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3477.7599999999998s)]
*  Maybe this is so true, sometimes things happen with my kids [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3480.7599999999998s)]
*  and I'm like, no one's gonna even believe this, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3483.52s)]
*  but I was walking with my seven year old the other day [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3484.9s)]
*  and I said, what does it mean to be a good parent? [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3487.88s)]
*  What does it really mean, I'm curious. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3490.64s)]
*  Really thought, because [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3492.44s)]
*  means you're kind of strict. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3497.2s)]
*  And I said, what do you mean strict? [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3499.24s)]
*  You have certain rules that you think matter. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3503.12s)]
*  And he goes, but it also means, [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3506.68s)]
*  you also have to be loving and fun. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3509.7999999999997s)]
*  And my heart hurts hearing myself say this [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3512.68s)]
*  in a good way, hurting, they know. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3515.72s)]
*  I think kids know, and maybe he says that [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3518.36s)]
*  because that's what we are, but I think kids know. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3519.88s)]
*  And I can't even tell you how many kids I used to work with [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3521.7s)]
*  and teens especially, the pain of their parents [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3525.12s)]
*  not embodying their authority was so clear. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3529.7599999999998s)]
*  They knew that they shouldn't be out at a certain time. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3534.64s)]
*  They knew that they were hanging out with kids [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3538.8599999999997s)]
*  who were like bad news and their parents had no idea [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3540.72s)]
*  and they felt unanchored. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3543.7999999999997s)]
*  Like they really, really knew, [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3546.16s)]
*  not that their parents were an exerting power, [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3547.8399999999997s)]
*  that word isn't, their parents weren't embodying [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3549.7599999999998s)]
*  their appropriate authority to protect their kids. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3551.66s)]
*  I had something come to mind, which is not a phrase [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3556.18s)]
*  that I've ever used before or heard before. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3558.8599999999997s)]
*  But what comes to mind is kind of statements of stance. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3561.8999999999996s)]
*  I feel like statements of stance [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3567.56s)]
*  in parent-child relationships, families, workplace, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3569.7s)]
*  romantic relationships, et cetera, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3572.74s)]
*  are great when they're about actions [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3574.18s)]
*  or about sort of overriding themes. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3576.7799999999997s)]
*  Like no matter what, I'm trying to keep you safe. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3579.3s)]
*  I might not get everything right, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3583.1000000000004s)]
*  but like that is like non-negotiable internally [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3584.5s)]
*  and I'm gonna try and make it non-negotiable externally. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3587.9s)]
*  Like it's a statement of stance about actions [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3590.6200000000003s)]
*  like, or, you know, keeping you healthy and safe [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3592.5s)]
*  is my number one priority. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3596.6600000000003s)]
*  Those are facts. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3598.1400000000003s)]
*  Those are things that one can really say and believe [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3599.02s)]
*  and, you know, until the end of time, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3601.3s)]
*  be trying to incorporate into one's behavior. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3603.78s)]
*  But I feel like statements of stance about emotions [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3607.02s)]
*  are very dangerous. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3609.58s)]
*  Like we don't yell in this house. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3611.2599999999998s)]
*  You know, it's okay to cry, right? [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3617.22s)]
*  There's always a caveat. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3620.3s)]
*  Of course it's okay to cry, right? [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3621.5s)]
*  But there are times when crying is less appropriate. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3623.56s)]
*  There's times when yelling might be appropriate. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3625.58s)]
*  There's times when emotions need to be expressed [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3630.02s)]
*  or not expressed in a particular way [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3633.18s)]
*  because I, look, I don't think I'm alone in thinking that, [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3635.6s)]
*  you know, the kid tantruming in a public environment [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3639.2799999999997s)]
*  is an embarrassing thing for them, for their parent, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3643.7599999999998s)]
*  for people around and it's not the end of the world, right? [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3646.6s)]
*  That's a tantrum for goodness sake, right? [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3648.96s)]
*  Like people will survive. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3650.92s)]
*  But I feel like statements of stance about emotions [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3652.88s)]
*  kind of hold us to this standard [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3655.92s)]
*  that we'll never be able to meet. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3657.2799999999997s)]
*  But that statements of stance about action are, you know, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3659.16s)]
*  till we fail and, you know, hope we don't, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3664.8799999999997s)]
*  we can say things like, you know, [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3668.96s)]
*  my job is always to keep you safe. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3671.12s)]
*  I'm always going to try and make the best decision [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3672.72s)]
*  for you and for your sister, for instance. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3675.04s)]
*  But I think that many people, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3678.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm not just speaking from my own experience, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3680.3199999999997s)]
*  but in talking to friends and others [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3681.8799999999997s)]
*  that they grew up in homes where like [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3684.68s)]
*  there were these philosophies, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3686.3599999999997s)]
*  these like statements of stance. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3687.52s)]
*  And the moment that things didn't match [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3689.48s)]
*  that statement of stance, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3691.02s)]
*  like the whole concept of what parents and children [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3692.56s)]
*  are supposed to be about just kind of started to dissolve. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3695.32s)]
*  And it creates that underlying fear. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3698.4s)]
*  Like, do they even really know what they're doing? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3700.08s)]
*  Or maybe they don't know what they're doing, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3702.7599999999998s)]
*  but maybe they're trying. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3705.2s)]
*  So in any case, it's just something that maybe we could [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3706.32s)]
*  talk about for a moment. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3710.04s)]
*  I have some reactions to that. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3710.92s)]
*  I think, I mean, I kind of think you're talking about [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3711.96s)]
*  values and principles, right? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3713.7599999999998s)]
*  And so I think there are, in my house, to be honest, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3716.0s)]
*  it's not like we have some wall of like, [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3719.7599999999998s)]
*  these are our family values. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3721.16s)]
*  I mean, some families might do this. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3722.64s)]
*  I've seen those in people's homes. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3723.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's not. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3724.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, on the refrigerator. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3725.48s)]
*  Not organized enough to do that. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3726.3199999999997s)]
*  But if I thought about a couple that come to mind, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3728.24s)]
*  like my job is to keep my kids safe. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3730.8799999999997s)]
*  By the way, safe does not mean [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3733.16s)]
*  they're never in a situation without risk. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3735.2799999999997s)]
*  That's not what I mean. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3738.08s)]
*  But in general- [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3739.2799999999997s)]
*  That's its own form of danger. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3740.12s)]
*  Exactly, the minimization of risk is also not safe, right? [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3741.44s)]
*  So, but in general, my job is to keep you safe. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3745.3999999999996s)]
*  I'm not gonna let you do things that, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3747.16s)]
*  endanger yourself or others. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3749.3999999999996s)]
*  So that's one. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3750.8s)]
*  Another principle I think about is, [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3752.0800000000004s)]
*  I will always tell you the truth, [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3755.48s)]
*  even if it's uncomfortable. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3757.28s)]
*  Like, you can always count on me for that. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3759.1200000000003s)]
*  We call that, kind of, I call that truth over comfort. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3761.04s)]
*  Right, so if my kid says to me, [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3763.92s)]
*  how are babies made? [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3765.48s)]
*  That value is useful, right? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3766.8s)]
*  Another thing is like, all feelings are allowed. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3770.6400000000003s)]
*  Not all behaviors are okay, right? [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3773.5600000000004s)]
*  Stuff like that. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3775.52s)]
*  What about we don't swear in this house? [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3776.36s)]
*  So what I was about to say- [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3778.44s)]
*  And then you're on the phone and then you- [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3779.28s)]
*  What I was about to say is- [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3781.48s)]
*  Screw up and then the kid goes, you swore. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3782.3199999999997s)]
*  To me, what's very different, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3783.16s)]
*  is these kind of rigidities around behavior. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3785.16s)]
*  We don't swear. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3789.16s)]
*  Swearing is a behavior. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3790.0s)]
*  We don't cry in public behavior. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3791.12s)]
*  We don't tantrum here. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3793.12s)]
*  That's a behavior. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3794.12s)]
*  Behaviors, all the time, are a manifestation of feelings [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3795.2s)]
*  that overpower skills. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3800.48s)]
*  So saying we don't do certain behaviors, [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3802.44s)]
*  to me, it doesn't even make logical sense. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3804.48s)]
*  Well, what if I'm in a situation [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3806.4s)]
*  where I have a really intense emotion [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3808.18s)]
*  and don't have the skill to manage it, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3810.0s)]
*  we don't, the behavior is gonna happen, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3811.6800000000003s)]
*  and then I feel like a bad person. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3814.16s)]
*  That's very different than values around intention. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3816.44s)]
*  I want to be truthful with my kids, [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3819.4s)]
*  even if things are uncomfortable. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3822.0s)]
*  I might fumble around with the words, right? [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3823.6800000000003s)]
*  I might even sometimes lie [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3826.32s)]
*  because I didn't do that value in action. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3827.6s)]
*  But what I can come back to is, okay, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3829.6800000000003s)]
*  nobody lives their values 100% of the time. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3831.56s)]
*  So I think we're talking about actually something core [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3835.12s)]
*  to what we think about at Good Inside, [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3838.04s)]
*  which is I'm a good person with values [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3839.4s)]
*  who is totally imperfect [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3843.08s)]
*  and sometimes acts in ways I'm not proud of. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3845.12s)]
*  Both are true. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3847.64s)]
*  When families have values that are very behavior-based, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3848.56s)]
*  what ends up happening in the kids [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3852.2000000000003s)]
*  is they start to equate certain behaviors with morality. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3853.56s)]
*  These are good behaviors that make me loved in my family, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3857.6800000000003s)]
*  and these are bad behaviors [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3861.36s)]
*  that kind of make me feel like [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3863.44s)]
*  I'm not the right part of my family. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3864.44s)]
*  And they even make me wonder, [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3866.42s)]
*  am I lovable? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3868.08s)]
*  Am I good inside after all? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3869.12s)]
*  Am I worthy? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3871.2799999999997s)]
*  That's not good. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3872.52s)]
*  Because whenever we tie behavior to identity, that's shame. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3873.56s)]
*  And we've tried to motivate kids with shame [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3877.9s)]
*  for hundreds and hundreds of years, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3881.12s)]
*  and it does not work and causes a lot of problems. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3883.2s)]
*  I think another one, which is interesting, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3886.3199999999997s)]
*  especially as my kids get older, [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3887.6s)]
*  I said this to my teen recently, [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3888.68s)]
*  I said, this is really tricky. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3890.72s)]
*  One of my jobs, as always, [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3892.84s)]
*  has been to create guidelines and rules with you. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3894.64s)]
*  It's always gonna be kind of collaborative. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3898.84s)]
*  Some, because of my authority, will be directive [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3899.7200000000003s)]
*  that I believe are gonna keep you safe. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3902.04s)]
*  I think this really relates to a phone. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3904.4s)]
*  I wanna tell you another part of my job [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3905.62s)]
*  that might sound contradictory, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3907.2400000000002s)]
*  but I actually think we just need to hold them both at once. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3909.36s)]
*  Another part of my job is to be there for you [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3911.68s)]
*  when you inevitably go against those guidelines. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3914.82s)]
*  And I want you to know that. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3919.2s)]
*  We have rules around what can and cannot be done online. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3920.7200000000003s)]
*  And I'll say this here, [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3923.84s)]
*  and if you do become part [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3925.48s)]
*  of a really inappropriate text conversation, [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3929.2s)]
*  if there is bullying, [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3932.28s)]
*  if you do come across some images online [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3933.88s)]
*  that make you feel really uncomfortable [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3936.2s)]
*  and you're like, I shouldn't have seen that, [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3937.64s)]
*  you're not getting in trouble with me. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3939.84s)]
*  I'm not gonna throw you a party. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3941.36s)]
*  I will be there for you to help you through those moments. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3943.64s)]
*  Those things sound contradictory, [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3946.42s)]
*  and in our family, we know two things can be true, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3948.04s)]
*  and those are both true. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3950.32s)]
*  To me, that's a really important thing [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3952.0s)]
*  for a teenager to know. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3954.96s)]
*  Let's talk about guilt and shame. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3957.28s)]
*  Yes. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3959.0s)]
*  I've heard some kind of catchphrase-y stuff, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3959.84s)]
*  not from you, but like, oh, you know, [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3961.64s)]
*  guilt is about the thing you did, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3963.44s)]
*  and shame is a feeling about who we are. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3965.4s)]
*  And, you know, while I'm not against those sort of [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3967.52s)]
*  1990s, early 2000s kind of psychology-isms, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3971.52s)]
*  I feel like they're not very useful. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3975.66s)]
*  In the same way that hearing that there's a gap [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3977.88s)]
*  between stimulus and response. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3980.26s)]
*  And if you identify that gap, well then goodness, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3981.76s)]
*  you're gonna be the kind of person [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3983.76s)]
*  that can feel stressed but not be reactive. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3985.4s)]
*  You're gonna be responsive, not reactive. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3987.1200000000003s)]
*  That's just a bunch of words that doesn't, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3988.88s)]
*  here I'm a biologist, so I'll just say, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3992.1200000000003s)]
*  doesn't take into account the fact that [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3993.52s)]
*  the biology of stress changes your perception of time, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3995.56s)]
*  and a whole bunch of other things that [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=3999.1600000000003s)]
*  basically make that gap between stimulus and response [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4001.04s)]
*  much, much smaller. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4003.6800000000003s)]
*  And I think once people understand that, [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4005.6600000000003s)]
*  they go, oh, so like the kitchen refrigerator magnet [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4007.08s)]
*  or the poster on the wall that says, you know, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4011.32s)]
*  there's a gap between stimulus and response. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4013.82s)]
*  It was supposed to save me, but it didn't, of course not. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4015.6600000000003s)]
*  Like we're just in different states of mind [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4018.2200000000003s)]
*  at different times. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4019.98s)]
*  So, how do you define, no pressure here, [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4020.82s)]
*  but how do you define guilt versus shame? [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4024.94s)]
*  And what about guilt and shame? [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4029.5400000000004s)]
*  Great, two of my favorite topics. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4033.0200000000004s)]
*  I have a couple different ways of defining things. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4034.38s)]
*  I'm like you, to me, I like defining things [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4037.3s)]
*  in ways that are very concrete and very usable. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4039.78s)]
*  That's all, and if there's multiple ways of doing that, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4042.58s)]
*  that's great. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4044.54s)]
*  So, the way I think about guilt, [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4045.38s)]
*  and this will probably set us off in a direction [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4047.1s)]
*  about what is not guilt also, [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4048.66s)]
*  is guilt is a feeling I have when I act [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4051.0s)]
*  out of alignment with my values. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4054.3s)]
*  And in that way, guilt is a really useful feeling. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4058.04s)]
*  Real useful, because it makes me reflect on, [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4061.9s)]
*  wait, I didn't act in line with my values. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4065.3s)]
*  I wonder why. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4067.7799999999997s)]
*  What would I have had to do differently? [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4069.5s)]
*  What got in my way? [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4070.8s)]
*  Well, I'm so glad I have that information from my body [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4072.8799999999997s)]
*  to have this deeply uncomfortable feeling [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4074.56s)]
*  to set in that process, right? [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4076.8399999999997s)]
*  So, if I yell at my kid, I'm gonna feel guilty, right? [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4078.3599999999997s)]
*  I think about a time when my kid told me, [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4082.72s)]
*  I lied to you. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4086.12s)]
*  I did take that eraser from that kid in school, [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4087.3399999999997s)]
*  and I feel really guilty. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4090.04s)]
*  And I said, first of all, I'm so glad you told me that. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4091.4399999999996s)]
*  I'm so glad you're feeling guilty. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4095.7599999999998s)]
*  That's the right way to feel. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4097.0s)]
*  Now, there must have been something so hard [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4098.88s)]
*  about seeing something so shiny and fun that you don't have. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4100.8s)]
*  I totally get that. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4104.12s)]
*  And you're right, that's not in your values to take it. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4105.4400000000005s)]
*  So, that's a useful feeling. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4108.7s)]
*  That feeling's gonna help you [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4110.320000000001s)]
*  not do something like that again. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4111.72s)]
*  Let's figure out what you can do. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4113.02s)]
*  Not just to say, sorry, this is what parents miss. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4114.8s)]
*  You know what's gonna happen another time? [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4117.26s)]
*  You're gonna see something else pretty cool. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4119.2s)]
*  Someone's cubby. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4121.320000000001s)]
*  And you know what most people think? [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4122.56s)]
*  I'm gonna take that. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4124.88s)]
*  You're gonna have the pot again. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4125.72s)]
*  I would too. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4126.76s)]
*  What can you do the next time you have that thought? [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4127.96s)]
*  All of this comes because of guilt. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4130.0s)]
*  Useful feeling. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4131.96s)]
*  Guilt is a feeling you have [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4133.12s)]
*  when you act out of alignment with your values. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4135.02s)]
*  Now, to me, guilt is one of the most misunderstood feelings [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4137.16s)]
*  because what you hear all the time, [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4141.44s)]
*  and you'll hear how much it kind of conflicts [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4143.36s)]
*  with this definition, is something like this. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4145.48s)]
*  I haven't seen my friends in years. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4148.64s)]
*  There's finally a dinner. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4151.84s)]
*  But it would require me not to put my kid down to sleep. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4153.92s)]
*  If I'm talking to someone, I'd say, [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4159.26s)]
*  okay, well, I'm guessing you're not leaving your kid alone. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4160.9800000000005s)]
*  Now, again, my husband or my mom, [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4163.38s)]
*  someone who's a totally safe adult. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4165.34s)]
*  But Becky, I told my kid, and she was clinging to me, [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4168.3s)]
*  like, no, mommy, I needed to be you, I needed to be you. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4172.58s)]
*  And so I'm not going to dinner. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4174.860000000001s)]
*  Do you know what I'm gonna say, Andrew? [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4177.58s)]
*  Because I feel so guilty. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4178.42s)]
*  This is, all right. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4181.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh, someone asked me to be in the PTA meeting. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4183.14s)]
*  I'm so busy, I can't, but I can't do it [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4186.06s)]
*  because I feel so guilty. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4188.5s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4191.700000000001s)]
*  Again, I'm just curious. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4194.42s)]
*  I say, well, it sounds like you really want to go [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4195.820000000001s)]
*  to dinner with your friends. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4197.860000000001s)]
*  She's like, oh, I do. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4199.22s)]
*  All I do is parent these days. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4200.38s)]
*  I literally haven't seen these friends in years. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4201.660000000001s)]
*  They're in town. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4203.02s)]
*  And she said, tell me about your friendships. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4203.860000000001s)]
*  I said, I value my, yes. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4205.26s)]
*  I know that I'm kind of more than just someone [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4207.900000000001s)]
*  who puts down my kid for bed, and I love doing that, [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4210.900000000001s)]
*  but this matters too. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4212.820000000001s)]
*  So I said, this is really interesting. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4213.88s)]
*  You really value your friendships. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4215.1s)]
*  Your life right now feels out of balance [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4219.06s)]
*  in that your friendships, that part of your burner [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4221.34s)]
*  of your stove is like really low. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4223.780000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4225.22s)]
*  And you're not going because you feel guilty. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4226.06s)]
*  I just want to share an idea. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4227.860000000001s)]
*  Guilt is a feeling you have when you act out of alignment [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4228.740000000001s)]
*  with your values. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4230.740000000001s)]
*  It seems like going to dinner would be in line [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4231.9400000000005s)]
*  with your values and almost, it's like, yeah, it's true. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4235.46s)]
*  So what is this feeling? [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4237.9400000000005s)]
*  And here's what I think the feeling is. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4241.02s)]
*  I call it not guilt just because I haven't figured out [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4242.82s)]
*  a more sophisticated term, but here's what I think [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4245.3s)]
*  is happening. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4246.94s)]
*  A lot of us, especially women, when we were growing up, [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4248.179999999999s)]
*  we learned to notice everyone's feelings around us. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4253.42s)]
*  And we learned that our value really, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4258.0199999999995s)]
*  and our worth really, and we were kind of best [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4261.82s)]
*  and good girls when we took care of everyone else's feelings [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4265.38s)]
*  except for our own. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4271.38s)]
*  I think so many young girls especially become expert [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4273.3s)]
*  at what people need of them by becoming distant [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4277.9800000000005s)]
*  from what they need for themselves. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4282.7s)]
*  The picture I get in my mind is sort of like having [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4285.26s)]
*  an antennae cast in every direction. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4286.9400000000005s)]
*  That's right. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4289.26s)]
*  Except perhaps at the exclusion of paying attention [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4290.1s)]
*  to the antennae that are inward. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4293.62s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4296.22s)]
*  And we are, you know, attentional resources [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4297.06s)]
*  are finite. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4299.62s)]
*  I mean, we just don't have the capacity to like, [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4300.54s)]
*  respond to other people's emotions and feel at the same time [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4304.3s)]
*  to the same degree that we would have, [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4306.860000000001s)]
*  if we just concentrated on theirs or our emotions. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4308.1s)]
*  And that's just a fact of how humans work. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4310.14s)]
*  Yeah, and kids are oriented by attachment. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4311.820000000001s)]
*  They have to learn with their families. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4313.780000000001s)]
*  How do I become the most lovable, safest version of myself? [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4315.780000000001s)]
*  So I have a friend who it's true. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4318.860000000001s)]
*  I remember her even in middle school. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4320.46s)]
*  I can't come. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4322.5s)]
*  My dad's traveling and my mom really needs me to stay home [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4323.9400000000005s)]
*  and watch a movie with her. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4326.780000000001s)]
*  And I know this mom well. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4328.46s)]
*  It's like, oh, you don't love me. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4329.7s)]
*  You don't, right? [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4331.46s)]
*  I mean, this was, so she became expert [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4332.3s)]
*  at always noticing other people's emotions [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4334.58s)]
*  and not only noticing them, taking the emotions from them, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4338.3s)]
*  kind of like taking them into their body [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4342.62s)]
*  and almost metabolizing them for them. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4345.14s)]
*  That's not guilt. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4350.54s)]
*  That is taking someone else's emotions [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4352.3s)]
*  and taking them into your body. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4355.820000000001s)]
*  At the expense of taking care of your own needs. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4358.7s)]
*  And so I have a visual for this [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4361.46s)]
*  because I think it's really powerful where, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4362.66s)]
*  let's say it's the situation where a mom is saying, [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4364.7s)]
*  I really wanna go out to dinner, but I feel so guilty. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4366.74s)]
*  First thing is just powerful to say that is not guilt. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4369.06s)]
*  It is something else and it is real and it is powerful, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4371.46s)]
*  but it is not guilt. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4373.54s)]
*  What is happening? [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4376.14s)]
*  I'm on one side of a tennis court, like me and you, Andrew, [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4377.22s)]
*  but let's say it's a tennis court [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4379.860000000001s)]
*  and you're on the other side or even in between [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4381.1s)]
*  and instead of a net, it's like a glass table. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4383.860000000001s)]
*  Over here, I am here in my desire to go out with my friends [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4386.5s)]
*  because I do value my friendships. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4391.34s)]
*  Over there is you're upset about it. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4393.62s)]
*  And let's say instead you're my daughter. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4397.1s)]
*  You're like, no, no, don't go. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4398.74s)]
*  No one else can put me to bed. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4401.46s)]
*  That is definitely hard to deal with, [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4402.78s)]
*  but that is your daughter's feelings. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4404.06s)]
*  Those are not your feelings. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4407.02s)]
*  Those are your daughter's feelings. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4408.14s)]
*  And some of us slash a lot of us [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4409.38s)]
*  have developed this tendency where we're on this court [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4411.78s)]
*  and all of a sudden, all those feelings from your side [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4413.9s)]
*  somehow go through that wall and they come to your side [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4416.74s)]
*  and you call it guilt. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4420.0599999999995s)]
*  It is not guilt. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4421.74s)]
*  And to me, one of the most liberating things, [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4423.5s)]
*  and this actually relates to empathy, [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4425.379999999999s)]
*  as I was saying, is to give that feeling back [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4427.54s)]
*  to its rightful owner. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4430.299999999999s)]
*  Because what that means is if I really give it back, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4432.46s)]
*  now I have a boundary. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4435.94s)]
*  That's my kid's feeling. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4437.46s)]
*  That's not mine. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4438.9s)]
*  And I can now actually empathize. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4440.58s)]
*  People said, no, I was empathizing. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4443.22s)]
*  I wasn't going out. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4444.54s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4445.66s)]
*  That's not empathy. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4446.9800000000005s)]
*  You weren't going out with your friends [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4448.42s)]
*  because you couldn't handle the distress in your body. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4449.9400000000005s)]
*  You just made your daughter's feelings your own. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4452.06s)]
*  You just engaged in something almost selfish. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4454.42s)]
*  This has nothing to do with your daughter. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4456.54s)]
*  In those situations, that's why we say weird things [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4458.22s)]
*  to our four-year-old. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4460.3s)]
*  Like, don't you want mommy to have friends? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4461.14s)]
*  I feel like for a second, [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4463.26s)]
*  why are you asking me that question? [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4464.1s)]
*  It's like a pilot being like, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4465.900000000001s)]
*  don't you want me to make an emergency landing? [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4466.860000000001s)]
*  Like, if you need to make an emergency landing, [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4468.9400000000005s)]
*  don't ask me for permission. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4471.74s)]
*  Because once I give it back to my daughter, I can do this. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4473.9s)]
*  I can say, you really wish I would put you to bed tonight. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4476.38s)]
*  You're right. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4479.7s)]
*  It feels so different when grandma does it. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4480.54s)]
*  Oh, it does. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4482.66s)]
*  I'm going out. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4484.34s)]
*  It's okay if you're upset. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4485.74s)]
*  I'll be back and I'll kiss you [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4488.139999999999s)]
*  and I'll see you in the morning. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4490.0199999999995s)]
*  And then this next part is so important. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4491.66s)]
*  When you walk out, I don't want any person [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4493.42s)]
*  having any illusion that the daughter's gonna be like, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4495.54s)]
*  yes, you go girl. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4499.82s)]
*  No, she is going to scream. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4501.0599999999995s)]
*  That's okay. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4503.9s)]
*  Going back to the boundary. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4504.74s)]
*  You're allowed to take care of your needs [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4506.62s)]
*  and other people are allowed to be inconvenienced [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4510.0199999999995s)]
*  and upset by it. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4513.98s)]
*  It doesn't mean your needs are wrong. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4515.58s)]
*  It doesn't mean their feelings are wrong [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4518.46s)]
*  and it definitely doesn't mean you feel guilty. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4520.62s)]
*  I'd like to take a quick break [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4525.54s)]
*  and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Element. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4527.82s)]
*  Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4530.5s)]
*  but nothing you don't. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4533.139999999999s)]
*  That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium and potassium [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4534.46s)]
*  all in the correct ratios, but no sugar. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4537.339999999999s)]
*  Proper hydration is critical [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4539.78s)]
*  for optimal brain and body function. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4541.099999999999s)]
*  Even a slight degree of dehydration [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4543.219999999999s)]
*  can diminish cognitive and physical performance. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4544.86s)]
*  It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4547.54s)]
*  The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium and potassium [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4549.78s)]
*  are vital for the functioning of all the cells in your body, [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4552.5s)]
*  especially your neurons or your nerve cells. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4555.02s)]
*  Drinking Element dissolved in water [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4557.3s)]
*  makes it extremely easy to ensure [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4558.700000000001s)]
*  that you're getting adequate hydration [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4560.18s)]
*  and adequate electrolytes. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4562.02s)]
*  To make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of hydration [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4563.620000000001s)]
*  and electrolytes, I dissolve one packet of Element [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4565.780000000001s)]
*  in about 16 to 32 ounces of water [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4568.38s)]
*  when I wake up in the morning [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4570.42s)]
*  and I drink that basically first thing in the morning. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4571.42s)]
*  I also drink Element dissolved in water [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4573.9400000000005s)]
*  during any kind of physical exercise that I'm doing, [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4575.620000000001s)]
*  especially on hot days when I'm sweating a lot [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4578.3s)]
*  and therefore losing a lot of water and electrolytes. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4580.42s)]
*  They have a bunch of different [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4583.26s)]
*  great tasting flavors of Element. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4584.1s)]
*  They have watermelon, citrus, et cetera. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4585.9400000000005s)]
*  Frankly, I love them all. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4588.02s)]
*  And now that we're in the winter months [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4589.3s)]
*  in the Northern hemisphere, [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4590.58s)]
*  Element has their chocolate medley flavors back in stock. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4592.02s)]
*  I really like the chocolate flavors, [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4595.02s)]
*  especially the chocolate mint when it's heated up, [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4596.34s)]
*  so you put it in hot water. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4598.22s)]
*  And that's a great way [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4599.7s)]
*  to replenish electrolytes and hydrate, [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4600.52s)]
*  especially when it's cold and dry outside [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4602.46s)]
*  when hydration is especially critical. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4604.780000000001s)]

*  Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4620.52s)]
*  8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4623.280000000001s)]
*  and sleep tracking capacity. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4625.8s)]
*  Now I've spoken many times before on this podcast [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4627.52s)]
*  about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4629.56s)]
*  of quality sleep each night. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4631.68s)]
*  That's truly the foundation of all mental health, [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4633.26s)]
*  physical health and performance. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4635.360000000001s)]
*  And one of the best ways to ensure [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4636.92s)]
*  that you get a great night's sleep [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4638.200000000001s)]
*  is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4639.52s)]
*  And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4642.02s)]
*  your body temperature actually has to drop [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4644.780000000001s)]
*  by about one to three degrees. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4646.56s)]
*  And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized, [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4648.1s)]
*  your body temperature actually has to increase [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4650.6s)]
*  about one to three degrees. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4652.52s)]
*  8 Sleep makes it incredibly easy to control the temperature [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4654.120000000001s)]
*  of your sleeping environment [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4656.64s)]
*  by allowing you to control the temperature [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4657.92s)]
*  of your mattress cover at the beginning, middle [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4659.4800000000005s)]
*  and end of the night. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4661.6s)]
*  I've been sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4662.76s)]
*  for nearly four years now, [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4664.400000000001s)]
*  and it has completely transformed [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4665.64s)]

*  of the pod cover, the pod four ultra. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4671.22s)]
*  The pod four ultra has improved cooling [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4673.84s)]
*  and heating capacity, [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4675.64s)]
*  higher fidelity sleep tracking technology [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4677.0199999999995s)]

*  Wow. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4703.18s)]
*  I say wow because I think the lens [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4704.18s)]
*  that you're looking at guilt through [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4707.46s)]
*  and the way you're defining it is so very different [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4708.88s)]
*  than the way it's been discussed ever. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4711.120000000001s)]
*  And I think this is a super, super important topic. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4712.860000000001s)]
*  So I'd like to lathe into it a little bit more. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4716.34s)]
*  In some ways, the way that I think many people experience [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4720.9800000000005s)]
*  guilt, at least according to your definition, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4725.92s)]
*  by the way, I love, [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4728.88s)]
*  it's when we've act out of alignment with our values [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4730.639999999999s)]
*  versus feeling pressure. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4734.139999999999s)]
*  Like I think about, I mean, Lord knows [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4737.44s)]
*  I don't have the best reputation [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4739.68s)]
*  as having a short text response latency. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4740.88s)]
*  It's variable. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4745.48s)]
*  Sometimes I'm quick on the draw [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4746.42s)]
*  and other times I'm like, oh goodness, [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4747.76s)]
*  it'll be days or weeks. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4749.3s)]
*  I mean, over the holidays, I was spooling through it. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4750.32s)]
*  I would respond to people like a week later. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4752.04s)]
*  And I do my best, but I do often feel, [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4754.44s)]
*  quote unquote, guilty about not being as responsive in text [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4760.639999999999s)]
*  to a number of people because I care about them. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4764.8s)]
*  I value them. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4767.44s)]
*  But I get overwhelmed by text messaging very easily [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4769.12s)]
*  to the point where I have to put my phones out of the room [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4772.04s)]
*  when I work, et cetera. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4774.24s)]
*  So the way I experience a bunch of text messages coming in [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4776.32s)]
*  is as pressure that then I feel guilty. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4780.72s)]
*  I'm not trying to make this about me. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4784.56s)]
*  No, I want to, let's go into this. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4785.400000000001s)]
*  I have a lot to say. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4787.0s)]
*  I feel quote unquote guilty, but what's interesting is [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4788.0s)]
*  I believe in cognitive dissonance. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4791.68s)]
*  And then what I notice is that then my brain [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4793.32s)]
*  tries to bridge that gap. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4795.52s)]
*  I come up with these like justifications with like, [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4797.32s)]
*  well, when I text people and they don't respond [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4799.76s)]
*  for like two weeks, I don't get upset, which is true [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4801.6s)]
*  unless it's in a particular sort of category [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4803.52s)]
*  of circumstances. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4805.88s)]
*  So how come the way they view this whole dynamic [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4806.7s)]
*  is not the same as the way I view this dynamic? [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4810.04s)]
*  Maybe this is a more male centric view [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4812.0s)]
*  as opposed to feeling porous, like I feel they're upset. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4813.84s)]
*  But I will say, in fairness to all the chromosomes [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4817.52s)]
*  and their arrangements, I do feel bad. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4820.88s)]
*  Like it sucks. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4824.08s)]
*  Like I love these people and they're reaching out [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4824.92s)]
*  to say whatever, happy new year or something. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4827.4s)]
*  And I'm feeling pressure as opposed to feeling [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4829.68s)]
*  how wonderful it is to have people in my life. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4834.08s)]
*  So here, this is such a beautiful example [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4835.72s)]
*  where I'd ask myself or I'd ask you to ask yourself, [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4838.04s)]
*  okay, you already named one of your values, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4840.56s)]
*  which is interesting. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4844.080000000001s)]
*  I really value my relationships. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4845.280000000001s)]
*  You said that. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4846.76s)]
*  Okay, that's one value. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4847.580000000001s)]
*  And I think this is, I'm gonna ask this question. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4849.68s)]
*  Do you value quick responses all the time [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4851.4800000000005s)]
*  from you on text message? [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4856.320000000001s)]
*  Is that a value of yours? [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4857.88s)]
*  From me or to me? [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4859.120000000001s)]
*  From you. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4860.4800000000005s)]
*  Do I value always responding to people on text right away? [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4862.240000000001s)]
*  The truth is, if I'm really honest, [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4864.84s)]
*  I hate shallow exchange of any kind, [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4867.32s)]
*  except maybe a fist bump to somebody [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4871.84s)]
*  you just kind of feel some kinship with on the street [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4874.24s)]
*  and you have that connecting [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4876.08s)]
*  and you just give them the fist bump, great. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4877.0s)]
*  But I like more in-depth lengthy connection. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4879.34s)]
*  Like three hour long conversation. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4882.799999999999s)]
*  Three hour long conversations or drop it. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4884.16s)]
*  I have a friend came by the other day for New Year's. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4886.759999999999s)]
*  He was on my list of people that, [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4889.32s)]
*  and yes, I made a list of people that I want to deepen [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4890.639999999999s)]
*  my friendship with in the New Year. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4893.2s)]
*  He came by, we had a two hour lunch, we chatted, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4895.04s)]
*  and I feel like it was awesome [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4898.28s)]
*  and worth a million single line text messages. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4901.36s)]
*  And I'm also the kind of person where like, [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4904.32s)]
*  I'm good to not see him for a while, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4905.92s)]
*  not because I'm tired of him, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4908.08s)]
*  but because I also have other friends and things to do. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4909.2s)]
*  So I'm more of a depth, not breadth kind of guy. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4911.88s)]
*  This is to me, this is such a powerful process. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4914.88s)]
*  And then after this, I kind of want to link it back [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4917.2s)]
*  to how I've actually told my kids about [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4918.82s)]
*  why I do go out to dinner with friends, right? [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4922.56s)]
*  So I value deep relationships. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4925.160000000001s)]
*  I value relationships. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4927.04s)]
*  I value deep relationships. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4927.88s)]
*  And if I'm honest with myself, [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4929.280000000001s)]
*  responding to someone right away, [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4931.64s)]
*  it's actually not my value. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4933.04s)]
*  But again, we can hold multiple things at once. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4934.360000000001s)]
*  That doesn't mean I don't care about those people. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4936.160000000001s)]
*  And I just laid out all my values. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4938.120000000001s)]
*  What I think is so powerful as a not guilt diffuser [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4940.4400000000005s)]
*  is naming this directly to the people. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4945.04s)]
*  So it doesn't have to be on text, [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4948.080000000001s)]
*  but you're seeing person X and you know, [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4949.72s)]
*  I'm never that good. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4951.08s)]
*  I just want to tell you, I really value our friendship. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4952.12s)]
*  I really value these times we have together. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4954.88s)]
*  Something I just also want to get off my chest [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4957.48s)]
*  is going back and forth quickly on text. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4959.12s)]
*  That's not something that's easy for me [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4962.12s)]
*  that I do very often. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4964.6s)]
*  And so you might text me and it might take me a while. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4966.16s)]
*  And I just wanted to name that to you, right? [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4969.08s)]
*  Now look, someone else always has the right to say, [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4971.88s)]
*  well, that's interesting. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4974.6s)]
*  That doesn't work for me. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4975.48s)]
*  And one of my top values with friends [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4976.32s)]
*  is someone who's always getting back and forth. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4978.38s)]
*  To me, that's actually great, great. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4981.78s)]
*  Now we know, okay, what are we going to do about that? [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4982.62s)]
*  That's fine. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4983.74s)]
*  You know where someone stands. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4984.58s)]
*  And the reason I relate this to the situation [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4985.54s)]
*  with going to dinner is I remember early on [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4988.299999999999s)]
*  when my daughter said, [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4992.0599999999995s)]
*  why do you have to go to dinner with friends? [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4993.0199999999995s)]
*  Or why do you and dad, this is it, [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4994.46s)]
*  why do you and dad go to dinner without us? [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4996.54s)]
*  I know the couple you're going out with, [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=4998.419999999999s)]
*  you both have kids, why can't you bring us, right? [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5000.099999999999s)]
*  And this is where we say we feel guilt, [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5002.7s)]
*  but we don't, because I'm like, time out. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5005.339999999999s)]
*  She's feeling this feeling, not me. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5007.42s)]
*  And also I don't need her permission or approval. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5010.7s)]
*  That's the real parentified thing. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5014.1s)]
*  We like go to our seven year old and we're like, [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5015.7s)]
*  don't you want me to have adult conversations? [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5017.26s)]
*  Again, not- [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5019.9400000000005s)]
*  It's not an atypical response. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5020.78s)]
*  I've heard parents do that. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5022.14s)]
*  Say that. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5023.1s)]
*  Like, don't you want me to have a social life? [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5023.9400000000005s)]
*  But you know what it is? [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5025.3s)]
*  It is asking your kid to do your job for you. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5027.9400000000005s)]
*  Again, can you imagine a pilot say, [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5030.74s)]
*  do you think we should make an emergency landing? [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5033.54s)]
*  You'd be, that's how a kid feels when they're asked that. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5035.82s)]
*  They're like, why are you asking me that? [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5039.0199999999995s)]
*  Here's what I said to my daughter in that situation. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5041.74s)]
*  I really did. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5043.94s)]
*  I want to tell you something. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5044.98s)]
*  I love being your mom. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5046.82s)]
*  I really do. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5048.0199999999995s)]
*  It's one of the most important things in my life. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5049.0199999999995s)]
*  I also really like being married to dad. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5052.5s)]
*  And I really like the times we have [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5056.34s)]
*  when it's just us and other adults. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5058.46s)]
*  That's really important. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5060.74s)]
*  I remember saying this, [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5062.219999999999s)]
*  maybe I was really trying to double down. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5063.0599999999995s)]
*  We actually, we had that before you guys were here. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5064.66s)]
*  Like what? [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5068.74s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5069.58s)]
*  And so one of the reasons, I want to be honest with you, [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5070.42s)]
*  why do we go to dinner without you? [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5074.3s)]
*  It's not so much we go to dinner without you. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5076.74s)]
*  We think of it as going to dinner with each other [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5078.0599999999995s)]
*  and just adults. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5080.82s)]
*  Is that something we really enjoy? [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5081.82s)]
*  It's really important to us. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5083.62s)]
*  It's a really important part of us. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5085.139999999999s)]
*  And that's why. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5087.38s)]
*  Being really vocal about your values [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5089.74s)]
*  as opposed to looking to your child unconsciously [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5093.94s)]
*  to give you permission to have those values. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5098.98s)]
*  If you want to use power, that's a power move. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5101.7s)]
*  And it's amazing. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5105.379999999999s)]
*  This is true at any time in life. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5106.54s)]
*  The more you can locate someone, [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5108.82s)]
*  the more you respect their boundaries. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5111.46s)]
*  I use that word a lot, locate. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5113.66s)]
*  I'm sure you know people in your life. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5116.379999999999s)]
*  Can I locate them? [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5117.82s)]
*  You kind of know who they are. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5118.82s)]
*  You know what they value. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5119.74s)]
*  And you respect them, right? [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5122.24s)]
*  When you can't locate someone, [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5124.44s)]
*  you feel very uneasy around them. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5127.799999999999s)]
*  You're kind of like, where are you? [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5129.5199999999995s)]
*  Who are you? [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5130.5599999999995s)]
*  What do you stand for? [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5131.4s)]
*  And as you can see with my daughter, [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5132.24s)]
*  I wasn't saying something mean. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5134.24s)]
*  I was saying something true. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5136.719999999999s)]
*  And so I think with the friendships, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5138.799999999999s)]
*  and when you say, is this guilty, [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5140.28s)]
*  it's like, well, maybe my step and my action [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5141.719999999999s)]
*  is just actually being honest with this person. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5144.44s)]
*  I'm not very good at responding right away. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5146.92s)]
*  I want to let you know, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5148.5599999999995s)]
*  I deeply care about our friendship. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5149.4s)]
*  I'm not very good at responding [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5151.599999999999s)]
*  to kind of small talk over text. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5153.16s)]
*  And I just wanted to let you know that [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5156.08s)]
*  so you didn't misinterpret it. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5157.5199999999995s)]
*  Like, I wonder what would happen. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5158.799999999999s)]
*  I wonder if people would kind of respond really positively. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5160.0s)]
*  I love it. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5164.44s)]
*  And I can't help but recall when I was a kid, [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5165.28s)]
*  after dinner, my dad would sometimes take a walk by himself. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5169.08s)]
*  Now, granted, he's a physicist [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5172.879999999999s)]
*  and he's a theoretical physicist. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5174.639999999999s)]
*  So he's like all his experiments were in his head. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5176.5599999999995s)]
*  He did work on paper too. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5178.759999999999s)]
*  But so he would take these walks. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5179.799999999999s)]
*  And occasionally I'd see him coming back from these walks [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5182.48s)]
*  and he'd be smoking a cigar, [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5184.599999999999s)]
*  something he doesn't do anymore, unfortunately. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5186.44s)]
*  I'm grateful that he's very robust. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5188.5599999999995s)]
*  He was actually a guest on the podcast recently. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5190.16s)]
*  Talked about science and life, et cetera. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5192.24s)]
*  And one of the things that I remember thinking [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5195.28s)]
*  and still to this day, think and feel is, [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5198.24s)]
*  it's kind of awesome how he takes this walk [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5201.24s)]
*  and he looked like so happy with the cigar and his thoughts [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5203.639999999999s)]
*  and he'd walk. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5207.32s)]
*  And I wanted to be on those walks with him. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5209.2s)]
*  He was very, very busy. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5210.24s)]
*  In fact, I wanted a lot more time from him than I got. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5211.36s)]
*  It's kind of interesting because now it's oftentimes [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5214.0s)]
*  that I'm the busier one, the tables turn, kids. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5216.04s)]
*  But in all seriousness, I didn't think of it as self-care, [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5219.719999999999s)]
*  but it was so clear that that was his time. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5223.5599999999995s)]
*  That was absolutely his time. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5226.36s)]
*  And I knew when I could and should join for things [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5228.639999999999s)]
*  and when I didn't. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5233.639999999999s)]
*  And so when you say the more you can locate someone, [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5234.48s)]
*  the more you respect their values. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5237.08s)]
*  I feel like bells go off. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5238.96s)]
*  It's like exactly that. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5241.04s)]
*  And there are other examples of my mom, et cetera. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5242.24s)]
*  But it's kind of interesting when we see somebody, [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5244.12s)]
*  adult or child, like really in their element of their thing. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5247.84s)]
*  It's almost like we love them for it and through it. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5252.88s)]
*  And it fills us, I think, with a healthy sense of safety. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5256.92s)]
*  Like they're right there. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5260.68s)]
*  Kind of like the pilot flying the plane really well. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5261.88s)]
*  Actually, we don't really want to know about the pilot. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5264.4s)]
*  I want to hear the thing at the beginning. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5266.12s)]
*  We're about ready to take off. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5267.599999999999s)]
*  I actually don't like it when we're landing [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5269.04s)]
*  and they say, we'll be on the ground in just a few moments. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5270.4s)]
*  I'm like, we're at 10,000 feet. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5272.72s)]
*  Can we make it a little bit longer than that? [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5273.96s)]
*  But you get the point, which is that [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5275.88s)]
*  I don't want to hear from the pilot. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5278.88s)]
*  I just want the pilot to fly the plane. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5280.8s)]
*  You want the pilot to do their job. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5282.5599999999995s)]
*  And again, I think I have so many pilot metaphors [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5284.72s)]
*  around sturdy leadership. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5287.64s)]
*  And I think it really is such a metaphor [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5288.72s)]
*  for how we teach people the skills they need to parent. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5290.04s)]
*  Because again, no one becomes a pilot overnight. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5293.92s)]
*  No one becomes a CEO overnight. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5296.84s)]
*  No one becomes a lawyer overnight [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5299.24s)]
*  or a professional basketball player. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5300.4800000000005s)]
*  I think we actually laud CEOs these days who say, [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5302.6s)]
*  I don't know how to do leadership as well as I'd want to. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5305.8s)]
*  I'm getting executive coach. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5307.8s)]
*  You all want to work for that person. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5309.28s)]
*  The amazing athletes in the world get amazing coaches. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5311.96s)]
*  And they go to amazing training camps [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5315.84s)]
*  because they're amazing. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5317.4400000000005s)]
*  And so somehow with parenting, it's like the last area [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5318.76s)]
*  where people think I should become [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5323.52s)]
*  an amazing parent overnight. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5324.8s)]
*  I shouldn't have to invest in skills or education. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5326.200000000001s)]
*  Even people who invest in skills and education [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5329.320000000001s)]
*  for every other area of their life [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5331.0s)]
*  that they probably care about less. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5332.360000000001s)]
*  There's so much shame we've internalized [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5333.64s)]
*  that we should be able to do it naturally. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5335.84s)]
*  And you do become a parent overnight. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5338.120000000001s)]
*  You become a parent overnight. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5339.88s)]
*  You do, yes. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5341.280000000001s)]
*  I'll remember my graduate advisor [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5342.160000000001s)]
*  who had two kids while I was working in the lab [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5343.52s)]
*  saying that there were all these books back then [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5345.84s)]
*  about pregnancy. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5348.72s)]
*  And she was like, it's wild. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5350.280000000001s)]
*  There are all these things of what you should eat [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5351.320000000001s)]
*  and how you should, you and your partner [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5353.08s)]
*  and how you should prepare for the birth and all this. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5354.56s)]
*  And then at the hospital, they're like, here. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5356.4400000000005s)]
*  And you're like, ah. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5359.04s)]
*  Now granted that was in the early 2000s. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5360.64s)]
*  That's still what it is. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5362.76s)]
*  And they're like, what do you need? [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5363.84s)]
*  And they go, you need a car seat to leave the hospital. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5364.76s)]
*  Which by the way, you definitely need. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5366.6s)]
*  That's all? [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5368.6s)]
*  Like just a car seat? [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5369.64s)]
*  Like how am I supposed to manage this? [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5371.120000000001s)]
*  Because I think I want parents to know, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5373.08s)]
*  because again, there's just so much shame. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5375.280000000001s)]
*  And maybe we should talk about shame, right? [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5376.84s)]
*  Is the only thing that comes naturally [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5378.96s)]
*  when it comes to parenting is how you were parented. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5383.36s)]
*  That comes naturally. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5385.919999999999s)]
*  That lives in your bones. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5386.839999999999s)]
*  That lives in your circuits. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5387.759999999999s)]
*  And there might be some people who say, amazing. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5389.2s)]
*  I have the greatest privilege in the world. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5392.5599999999995s)]
*  Then what will come naturally is exactly what I value [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5393.959999999999s)]
*  and what I wanna do. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5397.24s)]
*  I would say more often, people would say some version [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5398.679999999999s)]
*  of definitely not what I wanna do [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5401.44s)]
*  or parts I'll take, parts I wanna do differently. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5403.16s)]
*  And to me, it's kind of like if you are brought up [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5406.919999999999s)]
*  speaking English and you really wanna speak Mandarin [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5408.679999999999s)]
*  half the time to your kid. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5412.8s)]
*  And someone said, are you gonna learn Mandarin naturally? [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5414.4s)]
*  I feel like someone's saying, [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5417.36s)]
*  how does one learn Mandarin naturally? [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5418.92s)]
*  You would, I don't know, you'd probably sign up [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5421.08s)]
*  for Duolingo, you'd find an app or something or a course. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5423.68s)]
*  And you'd then practice and practice [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5427.8s)]
*  and you'd be able to make progress [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5430.08s)]
*  because you actually learned something new. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5433.44s)]
*  And so I just think big picture, [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5436.72s)]
*  parents are, they're so under equipped and set up to feel, [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5440.08s)]
*  and this is I think has to do with shame, [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5445.2s)]
*  that when my kids are struggling or when I'm yelling a lot, [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5447.16s)]
*  it means something is wrong with me [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5450.879999999999s)]
*  or something is wrong with my kid. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5452.719999999999s)]
*  I feel like these days in almost every area, [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5455.719999999999s)]
*  if a CEO is saying, I feel like I'm struggling, [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5457.759999999999s)]
*  is it my fault or my employee's fault? [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5461.719999999999s)]
*  They probably say, I don't know, [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5464.28s)]
*  there's probably people around who can help me, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5466.32s)]
*  who can teach me, why do I keep yelling, right? [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5467.8s)]
*  And same thing with almost every other field. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5470.08s)]
*  And to me more than like if there's any legacy [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5472.68s)]
*  I get to leave in this world, [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5475.96s)]
*  it's not even the approach itself, [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5477.64s)]
*  even though I think our approach to parenting [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5479.4800000000005s)]
*  is very different. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5481.04s)]
*  I just want parents to know, [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5482.88s)]
*  like there is no shame in investing in learning [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5484.400000000001s)]
*  and growing in parenting and to look at that, [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5488.16s)]
*  like they probably look at every other area of their life. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5491.72s)]
*  I assure you that your legacy extends far beyond that, [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5494.84s)]
*  but includes it as well. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5498.6s)]
*  You've had a tremendous impact and continue to. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5499.72s)]
*  I mean, it wasn't long ago that the power dynamics [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5501.8s)]
*  of parent-child relationships where you do what I say [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5506.360000000001s)]
*  and I'm the parent, you're the kid [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5509.0s)]
*  and like that kind of thing. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5510.16s)]
*  And I grew up in a different era, I'm 49 now, [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5511.2s)]
*  and I've been wanting to say I'm 49 now [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5513.16s)]
*  so that I can actually say something [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5514.96s)]
*  with having had some experience [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5516.360000000001s)]
*  when things were truly very different, [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5518.24s)]
*  they were just so different. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5520.0s)]
*  It was like you took what you got and you worked with it [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5521.4400000000005s)]
*  and things are so different thanks to your part [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5524.360000000001s)]
*  in all of this. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5528.08s)]
*  And one thing I do wanna return to [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5528.92s)]
*  because I realized I took us off track with it [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5531.6s)]
*  is this idea of kids, but perhaps adults as well, [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5535.6s)]
*  or thinking they feel someone else's feelings, [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5542.400000000001s)]
*  taking that on, this difference between real guilt [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5544.400000000001s)]
*  and gosh, it's really hard to come up with a word for it. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5548.320000000001s)]
*  At one moment I thought, well, maybe it's faux guilt, [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5551.0s)]
*  but no, you're not pretending, [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5552.76s)]
*  you're actually feeling something which feels like guilt, [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5553.88s)]
*  smells like guilt, tastes like guilt. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5557.76s)]
*  Someone said codependence, [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5559.0s)]
*  I don't know that much about that word, [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5560.360000000001s)]
*  but something like that. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5562.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a whole landscape. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5563.16s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5565.52s)]
*  It's a whole landscape. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5566.4800000000005s)]
*  But one practice that I'm familiar with [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5568.2s)]
*  that I know exists in a couple of different realms [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5572.24s)]
*  of let's call it modern psychology tools [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5575.12s)]
*  is this idea of creating a frame separation. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5577.96s)]
*  So like after you come together with somebody, [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5581.16s)]
*  say to like do therapy or something, [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5583.16s)]
*  or you've had sort of an emotional bind or entanglement, [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5586.24s)]
*  doesn't have to be negative, [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5590.5599999999995s)]
*  that one way that you can learn over time [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5592.36s)]
*  to differentiate their needs and wants [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5595.84s)]
*  from your needs and wants is this idea of in your head, [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5598.72s)]
*  I know it sounds kind of corny, [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5602.24s)]
*  but there's a clear neuroscientific basis for this, [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5603.24s)]
*  at least to my understanding of in your head, [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5605.36s)]
*  you say, for instance, like if we had just done this, [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5607.84s)]
*  like we had some resonance around something, [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5609.48s)]
*  maybe an argument, okay, like Dr. Becky and I [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5610.76s)]
*  got into a fight that in order to really be able [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5613.16s)]
*  to move away from that and see it clearly, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5615.92s)]
*  how much of that was yours, how much of that was mine, [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5618.2s)]
*  there's this idea that you tell yourself, [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5620.6s)]
*  okay, what are five ways in which you and I [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5622.360000000001s)]
*  are clearly distinct entities? [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5624.16s)]
*  So you say, and I know this folks might chuckle at this, [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5626.4400000000005s)]
*  but you say like, okay, I'm a man, you're a woman. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5628.64s)]
*  I live in California, Dr. Becky lives in New York. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5630.84s)]
*  Could even make it like first person, [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5635.2s)]
*  you say like, or third person rather, [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5636.64s)]
*  you can say, I, Andrew Huberman, [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5637.96s)]
*  I'm wearing a black shirt and a black over shirt [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5639.04s)]
*  and Dr. Becky is wearing black and white. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5642.72s)]
*  Okay, so some people might think like, [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5645.4s)]
*  what's the use of that? [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5647.84s)]
*  But to me as a neuroscientist, [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5648.88s)]
*  whoever came up with that and it wasn't me [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5650.64s)]
*  is nothing short of brilliant [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5652.64s)]
*  because the brain organizes emotions [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5654.5199999999995s)]
*  in these broader schemas of physical objects [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5656.76s)]
*  and physical distance and distance in time. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5659.24s)]
*  And that's the way that we can differentiate [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5662.48s)]
*  between ourselves and everything around us. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5664.08s)]
*  And there's a whole discussion to be had about this, [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5665.84s)]
*  so it's something that I've been playing with a little bit [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5668.28s)]
*  because I don't claim to be this ultra empath or anything, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5672.839999999999s)]
*  but I think it's clear that sometimes we take in [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5677.679999999999s)]
*  our thoughts and feelings about what other people [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5684.5599999999995s)]
*  are feeling, sometimes accurate, sometimes not, [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5687.2s)]
*  and it can become very difficult. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5688.959999999999s)]
*  Whether or not someone's a one of these, [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5691.16s)]
*  I guess you call it deeply feeling, [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5693.32s)]
*  deeply feeling kids. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5695.36s)]
*  Or not, I mean, anytime you get into an emotional resonance, [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5698.28s)]
*  good or bad, I think it's, we're porous, we're porous, [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5701.0s)]
*  and that's part of what makes humans so beautiful. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5705.599999999999s)]
*  But I found that practice to be very useful, [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5707.5599999999995s)]
*  even if it's just in my own head, [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5710.839999999999s)]
*  like they're over there and I'm over here, [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5712.04s)]
*  but not even necessarily pushing off them, [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5714.44s)]
*  but thinking like, oh, like I'm me and you're you. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5716.759999999999s)]
*  And there are a bunch of ways in which we differ [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5719.799999999999s)]
*  in time and space. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5722.0s)]
*  And I think the nervous system comes to understand that [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5723.32s)]
*  as a felt thing, as opposed to just a statement, [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5728.2s)]
*  like, hey, like you own your emotions, I'll own mine. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5731.04s)]
*  That's just a statement. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5733.599999999999s)]
*  Is this any of this? [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5735.92s)]
*  I've never heard of that, but I love that. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5736.839999999999s)]
*  And it is in parallel, I think, [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5738.12s)]
*  with so many of the things I teach parents. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5740.44s)]
*  So even the idea of locating someone, to me, [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5742.36s)]
*  like my version of people in my life that I know and love, [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5745.96s)]
*  even if I don't agree with anything they say [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5748.5599999999995s)]
*  that I can locate, they're like an egg with a shell. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5750.679999999999s)]
*  They have a shell. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5755.0s)]
*  There's a boundary. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5756.72s)]
*  We're really talking about boundaries. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5757.639999999999s)]
*  We all have different levels of porousness [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5760.16s)]
*  to the external world. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5762.5199999999995s)]
*  And I think if you know, and there's pros and cons of both, [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5764.28s)]
*  like I really mean this, [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5767.28s)]
*  I am not terribly porous to other people's experiences. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5768.84s)]
*  I really have solid boundaries. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5773.04s)]
*  There are definitely moments in my closest relationships [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5775.08s)]
*  because what people will say to me, [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5777.44s)]
*  okay, like I know these are my feelings and not yours. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5779.32s)]
*  Like we're in a close relationship. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5782.24s)]
*  Like, can you be here a little bit more with me? [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5783.92s)]
*  And that is true. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5787.16s)]
*  Like that is what I want to do, right? [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5788.0s)]
*  And sometimes it can be a little distancing, right? [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5789.96s)]
*  And a little separate. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5792.639999999999s)]
*  People on the other end of that spectrum, [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5795.04s)]
*  if they know I'm very porous, I tend to, [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5797.32s)]
*  to me, one of the ways of also thinking about it, [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5799.639999999999s)]
*  I think I gaze in before I gaze out. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5801.32s)]
*  And I think a lot of people gaze out before they gaze in. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5804.599999999999s)]
*  Right, they spend a lot of time in other people's brains [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5808.32s)]
*  and less time in their own, right? [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5810.84s)]
*  What do they think of me? [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5812.599999999999s)]
*  What do they think, right? [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5813.44s)]
*  If that's what's going on for you, [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5815.28s)]
*  then the shell to your egg isn't always intact. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5818.16s)]
*  And so there's a spillover. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5823.28s)]
*  Like whose feelings are whose? [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5824.8s)]
*  Whose thoughts are whose? [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5826.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm spending so much time worried [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5828.2s)]
*  about what that person thinks of me. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5830.0s)]
*  I almost like, what am I, what do I, what do I think? [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5831.599999999999s)]
*  Right? [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5833.96s)]
*  And so the exercise you're naming [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5834.8s)]
*  is actually just a resetting of a boundary, right? [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5837.0s)]
*  And things that are absurdly concrete are necessary [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5840.12s)]
*  for the most primal parts of our brain [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5844.96s)]
*  to actually understand. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5847.32s)]
*  My name is Becky Kennedy. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5848.92s)]
*  To me, what I say, I don't usually say that, [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5851.4800000000005s)]
*  I'll say my feet are on the ground. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5852.84s)]
*  When I do a grounding exercise, [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5857.4s)]
*  everyone in our community knows this, [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5859.72s)]
*  my hand is always on my heart. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5861.84s)]
*  I think there's some amount of having contact [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5863.4800000000005s)]
*  with your body, my hand is on my heart. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5865.36s)]
*  Sometimes I used to do this with clients, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5868.36s)]
*  especially after an emotional experience, [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5871.4800000000005s)]
*  going like this, name five things in the room [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5873.04s)]
*  is probably another way. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5875.72s)]
*  There's a red clock, I'm wearing a white shirt. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5877.08s)]
*  They're very, very, very basic [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5880.16s)]
*  as a way of kind of coming back into your body. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5883.04s)]
*  Two mantras that I find help parents a lot [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5886.92s)]
*  actually make me think about this exercise. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5890.52s)]
*  One is I am the pilot, not the turbulence. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5893.12s)]
*  In our kids' turbulent moments, [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5897.2s)]
*  when they are that turbulence, [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5899.2s)]
*  what so easily happens is we merge into that with them. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5901.72s)]
*  And then it's no wonder our kids can't calm down [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5906.8s)]
*  or episodes last forever [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5909.92s)]
*  because we're just turbulence and turbulence together. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5911.2s)]
*  So I'm the pilot, not the turbulence. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5914.12s)]
*  Also, one day I'm gonna do a partnership [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5915.8s)]
*  with some airplane company [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5918.400000000001s)]
*  because I feel like airplanes are just so beautiful [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5922.16s)]
*  because the pilot gets a cockpit, they get a boundary. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5924.400000000001s)]
*  That's what parents need. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5928.8s)]
*  So that's one. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5931.4800000000005s)]
*  And the other one, when your kids are upset [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5932.320000000001s)]
*  or after there's an argument, [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5933.72s)]
*  some people get very dysregulated [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5935.08s)]
*  just knowing someone's upset with them, right? [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5936.76s)]
*  Which is again, kind of whose feelings are whose. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5938.64s)]
*  I find one of the most effective mantras, [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5941.64s)]
*  and again, these sound cheesy, is just I'm safe. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5943.320000000001s)]
*  This isn't an emergency. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5947.56s)]
*  I can cope with this because our body, [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5949.8s)]
*  if you tend to be porous, [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5952.4400000000005s)]
*  you get activated just by other people being activated, [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5953.84s)]
*  even though it wasn't your feeling in the first place. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5957.72s)]
*  And your body actually needs the reminder [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5960.12s)]
*  that you're safe to not kind of add to that turbulence. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5962.76s)]
*  I love it. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5968.36s)]
*  Can we talk about projection for a second? [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5970.599999999999s)]
*  One of the things that drives me insane, [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5973.12s)]
*  people close to me know this, [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5977.2s)]
*  because of this issue of porousness versus non-porousness [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5979.16s)]
*  is when people tell me how I feel. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5983.64s)]
*  And so I've talked to a few very qualified psychiatrists [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5986.44s)]
*  about this and it's called projection. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5989.48s)]
*  Sometimes if in anger, it's a vacative projection, [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5991.48s)]
*  like you think I'm crazy, someone will say, [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5994.28s)]
*  like you think I'm crazy, [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5996.599999999999s)]
*  or you're upset with me or something like that. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=5998.12s)]
*  I feel like projection is one of the kind of litmus tests [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6001.5199999999995s)]
*  of how porous we are. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6006.839999999999s)]
*  Because in theory, somebody should be able to tell us [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6008.5199999999995s)]
*  that we feel whatever. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6011.4s)]
*  And if we first look inside, [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6013.5599999999995s)]
*  and by the way, I love this concept of, [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6016.0s)]
*  do you first look inside or outside? [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6017.56s)]
*  Do you listen to what's inside or outside first [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6020.04s)]
*  when something kind of arises emotionally outside you? [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6022.4800000000005s)]
*  Love, love, love that. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6026.92s)]
*  It's something I'll have to explore. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6027.92s)]
*  But if we don't do that, [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6032.4800000000005s)]
*  then you could see how projection would be very effective. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6034.72s)]
*  And I'm not accusing anyone of using this [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6037.68s)]
*  in any kind of diabolical way. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6039.68s)]
*  I think people just do it because it worked [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6040.96s)]
*  and they're doing it because they've always done it. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6042.400000000001s)]
*  But if somebody says, [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6044.92s)]
*  you don't care about me as a friend, [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6046.68s)]
*  or telling someone how they feel is so very different [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6048.4s)]
*  than telling someone how we feel, duh. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6053.12s)]
*  All right, it's kind of an obvious. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6056.48s)]
*  And yet once you start watching for projection, [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6057.36s)]
*  you see it all the time. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6059.64s)]
*  Not just at you, but in between people. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6061.84s)]
*  I know this stresses you out, [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6065.92s)]
*  but people start doing it all the time. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6067.12s)]
*  And it's very interesting to see how people kind of divide [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6069.12s)]
*  into a couple of different groups on this, [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6071.12s)]
*  maybe two or more groups, [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6072.64s)]
*  in terms of whether or not it affects them [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6074.36s)]
*  or if it gets in their head, [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6076.32s)]
*  or somehow they're like, no, no, it's ridiculous. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6077.88s)]
*  I don't feel that way. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6080.679999999999s)]
*  And for me, it's very context specific. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6081.88s)]
*  But I love your thoughts on projection [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6084.04s)]
*  both towards kids and from kids. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6087.96s)]
*  So, all right, I'm gonna respond to that. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6091.92s)]
*  And you just cut me off if you're like, [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6094.88s)]
*  Becky, that's not the direction I want you to go in. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6096.04s)]
*  Because I guess MGI, [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6097.88s)]
*  which is I call most generous interpretation, [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6100.96s)]
*  is to me the embodiment of not what I do all the time. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6104.36s)]
*  Definitely not, because I'm imperfect. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6107.4400000000005s)]
*  But what I think is just a useful framework [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6109.28s)]
*  to try to employ as much as possible. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6111.24s)]
*  Because the idea of what is the most generous interpretation [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6113.400000000001s)]
*  of someone's behavior, like projection, [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6117.2s)]
*  counteracts our very natural human tendency, [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6119.6s)]
*  which is just what is the least generous interpretation. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6122.08s)]
*  We all come up with the least generous interpretation [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6125.32s)]
*  of people's behavior all the time. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6127.8s)]
*  And it's just quick, it's easy. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6129.68s)]
*  And I think it's because in our brain, [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6131.32s)]
*  if we see something bad or annoying, [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6132.52s)]
*  it's just easy to think that that's the whole, right? [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6134.0s)]
*  So I can't even tell you how many times every parent I know, [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6136.88s)]
*  will say, my kid doesn't listen. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6140.120000000001s)]
*  They hit all the elevator buttons. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6141.4800000000005s)]
*  They hit other people. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6143.0s)]
*  And then I said, and I know what you're thinking, [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6144.52s)]
*  they're a sociopath. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6145.84s)]
*  They're like, that's literally what I'm thinking. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6146.68s)]
*  I was like, I know, I have that thought too. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6148.0s)]
*  You know, when I was a kid, [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6149.360000000001s)]
*  I used to put every button in the elevator. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6150.200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6152.4800000000005s)]
*  Does that mean I'm a sociopath? [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6153.320000000001s)]
*  No, it means you are a good kid [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6154.4800000000005s)]
*  who has not yet learned the skills to regulate urges. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6156.6s)]
*  That's all it means. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6160.6s)]
*  That would be the most generous interpretation. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6161.48s)]
*  They're there, you just wanna, no, I'm kidding. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6164.0s)]
*  You just wanna push them. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6164.839999999999s)]
*  I'm joking. You do. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6165.919999999999s)]
*  I have a kid like that too. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6167.04s)]
*  He wants things for himself [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6168.32s)]
*  and he derives a lot of joy from things. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6169.719999999999s)]
*  Those types of kids are gonna do things. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6172.2s)]
*  Okay, that's my resilient rebel. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6173.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay, but projection. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6176.4s)]
*  Why am I bringing that up? [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6178.959999999999s)]
*  So what's my most generous interpretation [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6180.04s)]
*  of why this projection would happen? [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6182.959999999999s)]
*  Why would a kid say, you're mad at me? [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6185.4s)]
*  Or, you know, I can see how mad you are at me. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6188.04s)]
*  Or why would someone even say in adulthood, [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6190.92s)]
*  you seem really, really stressed out, right? [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6193.88s)]
*  Again, the gazing in versus gazing out. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6196.36s)]
*  I think it comes back to, in our childhoods, [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6199.28s)]
*  I mean, that's what often a lot comes back to. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6201.88s)]
*  Were we taught that we have an emotional life [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6205.8s)]
*  that lives inside of us? [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6210.2s)]
*  Then were we taught how to understand that emotional life? [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6212.84s)]
*  Then were we taught how to manage [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6216.84s)]
*  and cope with that whole emotional life? [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6219.12s)]
*  Most people were not. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6221.599999999999s)]
*  So it becomes this very, very complicated conundrum. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6223.2s)]
*  The emotional life is happening inside me again. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6227.24s)]
*  Like you can't beat it. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6229.16s)]
*  It's happening. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6230.28s)]
*  Our feelings, we can't get rid of them. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6231.12s)]
*  And they're very powerful. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6233.24s)]
*  They're sensations. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6234.4s)]
*  But if your framework was always, [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6235.92s)]
*  you're getting punished, you're getting ridiculed, [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6238.04s)]
*  you're being a baby, [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6239.8s)]
*  then you develop a very conflictual relationship [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6240.96s)]
*  with your feelings. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6243.5599999999995s)]
*  Like they can't be real. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6244.4s)]
*  They almost can't be mine. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6246.0s)]
*  Actually, they can't be mine. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6248.0s)]
*  People like this often blame other people a lot [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6250.64s)]
*  for things they never did [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6254.04s)]
*  when they're really frustrated and upset. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6255.48s)]
*  Cause it's almost like, this can't be mine. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6257.16s)]
*  So like, who did this feeling to me? [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6259.0s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of that in the world. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6263.64s)]
*  A lot of that in the world. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6265.64s)]
*  Who did this feeling to me? [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6266.88s)]
*  Who put this in me? [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6268.96s)]
*  Right? [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6271.28s)]
*  It's so fragile and so sad almost. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6272.44s)]
*  And so, you know, toxic. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6276.52s)]
*  But projection in a way is the only way [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6280.04s)]
*  that I can understand my emotional life. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6283.12s)]
*  Is by imagining you having an emotional life. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6286.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6292.280000000001s)]
*  Like a lot of these things, [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6293.12s)]
*  I hear myself say this. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6294.08s)]
*  I like, Mel, I was like, [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6295.320000000001s)]
*  oh, what a vulnerable way to go about the world. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6296.4800000000005s)]
*  What an awful way to live in your body [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6299.280000000001s)]
*  that you're so overwhelmed [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6301.88s)]
*  and almost so self abandoning [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6305.2s)]
*  of the information in your body [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6311.96s)]
*  that it must be someone else's. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6313.52s)]
*  So that's what projection is. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6316.92s)]
*  So what do we do when we see it? [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6320.2s)]
*  Right? [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6322.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6323.76s)]
*  What's an example, right? [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6324.6s)]
*  Like you're so stressed out. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6325.4400000000005s)]
*  You've been so stressed. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6326.76s)]
*  And you're thinking, maybe you're thinking a partnership. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6328.16s)]
*  I feel like you're the one who's stressed, right? [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6330.639999999999s)]
*  Never helps in the heat of the moment to be right. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6334.32s)]
*  I've tried it a million times. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6337.4s)]
*  I don't know about you. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6338.8s)]
*  To be right in an argument. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6339.639999999999s)]
*  To be right in a heated moment [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6341.08s)]
*  when you're like, I'm gonna be right. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6342.44s)]
*  Not if you want an effective outcome. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6344.28s)]
*  No, but it's a very hard urge to resist. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6346.8s)]
*  It took me many years to learn, [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6349.44s)]
*  but someone taught it to me in one hour. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6350.88s)]
*  I feel very grateful that she taught me this. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6354.84s)]
*  She didn't tell me to do it, [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6357.76s)]
*  but I just realized if you just, [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6358.84s)]
*  I don't have any word other than just soften. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6361.64s)]
*  If you just kind of imagine becoming more like a noodle [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6364.72s)]
*  than a rigid bar of iron. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6371.08s)]
*  I just go. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6374.8s)]
*  And I actually, I think of the way that my, [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6375.64s)]
*  he always comes up, but I had this bulldog mastiff, Costello, [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6380.32s)]
*  and he was super lazy. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6382.96s)]
*  The contract with him was he would protect me [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6383.84s)]
*  with his entire life. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6385.64s)]
*  But if my life wasn't on the line, noodle. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6387.24s)]
*  And I remember just thinking, if I just go there, [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6391.16s)]
*  then the basic contract of I care about you, [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6394.92s)]
*  I'll protect you with my life is still there. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6398.0s)]
*  So I guess I learned it from my bulldog, [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6400.16s)]
*  but it sort of played out in a romantic relationship. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6401.679999999999s)]
*  And it was just really beautiful. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6404.04s)]
*  It was one of the best things I learned [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6405.08s)]
*  from the two of them. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6408.4s)]
*  Is that I just literally physically soften. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6410.719999999999s)]
*  Then everything becomes apparent. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6414.08s)]
*  Somehow for me, it allows me to get back [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6416.2s)]
*  into my own eggshell, but still have optics out. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6418.24s)]
*  Now that's me. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6422.16s)]
*  I realize it's, and that doesn't mean [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6423.0s)]
*  in the heat of the moment, I'm not feeling [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6424.44s)]
*  like I wanna be reactive. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6426.2s)]
*  But for me, a physical change to my body, [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6428.0s)]
*  self-directed physical change to my body [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6431.599999999999s)]
*  is what just kind of changed everything. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6433.84s)]
*  Yeah, and I think this is so true in relationships, [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6436.4s)]
*  definitely at work and definitely in parenting, [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6439.679999999999s)]
*  is you don't have to represent everything you believe in [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6442.44s)]
*  like a given moment. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6448.759999999999s)]
*  Like we're not so fragile, like to be like, [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6450.0s)]
*  no, and you're projecting, like I have time. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6452.24s)]
*  Like this is a heated moment. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6454.919999999999s)]
*  I can kind of chill out. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6457.32s)]
*  You're so stressed. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6459.0s)]
*  And I think I'm not, I think there's projection. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6459.839999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna say like, oh, I am? [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6461.36s)]
*  Well, who cares? [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6465.4s)]
*  Just like get through the moment, right? [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6466.24s)]
*  And then maybe after, if it feels important, [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6467.96s)]
*  I say, I feel like this thing happens sometimes [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6469.919999999999s)]
*  where when you're stressed, you say, I'm stressed. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6472.52s)]
*  I don't know, right? [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6473.72s)]
*  Like, let's talk about this. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6474.56s)]
*  That's when that happens. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6476.36s)]
*  I think this is really true with kids too, right? [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6478.08s)]
*  This happened the other day. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6482.08s)]
*  And in some ways it's the same strategy, [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6483.4s)]
*  which I jokingly on Instagram called do nothing [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6485.44s)]
*  with a capital D and a capital N [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6488.52s)]
*  because so many times in hard situations, [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6490.72s)]
*  especially when you're accused of something, [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6492.76s)]
*  that's not true, people will say to parents, [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6494.44s)]
*  oh, so you're just gonna do nothing? [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6497.0s)]
*  I'm like, take away the just. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6499.96s)]
*  Like doing nothing in a heated moment [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6501.92s)]
*  is a very sophisticated technique [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6504.04s)]
*  because really what you're saying is [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6506.6s)]
*  you're doing nothing on the outside [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6507.8s)]
*  and you're being an adult [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6509.84s)]
*  and managing your feelings on the inside. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6511.96s)]
*  Amen to that. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6514.320000000001s)]
*  Versus doing nothing on the inside [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6515.16s)]
*  and just yelling or reacting on the outside. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6519.12s)]
*  So the other day, my son came to me [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6521.76s)]
*  before school, my youngest, [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6524.16s)]
*  and he goes, my sweatshirt's still dirty. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6525.240000000001s)]
*  And I was like, oh man. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6527.4400000000005s)]
*  You promised me you would wash my sweatshirt before school. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6529.48s)]
*  Between us, he never asked me that, okay? [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6534.28s)]
*  And here's my fork in the road. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6538.48s)]
*  It's like, we all know what it would be easier. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6539.88s)]
*  And by the way, I wanted to say back to him, [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6542.48s)]
*  99% of me was about to go, you never asked me. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6545.2s)]
*  And then he'd say, I did. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6550.2s)]
*  No, you didn't. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6551.68s)]
*  And now you're lying to me. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6552.5199999999995s)]
*  And all of a sudden it's like, okay. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6553.72s)]
*  You know what he was saying to me? [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6555.5599999999995s)]
*  I wish my sweatshirt was clean. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6557.48s)]
*  That's what he was saying. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6560.759999999999s)]
*  That's what we're all saying. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6562.12s)]
*  And I'm so upset about it. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6563.639999999999s)]
*  The feeling is so big that it's like too overwhelming [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6565.919999999999s)]
*  in this moment as a seven-year-old to be mine. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6569.24s)]
*  So like, I kind of have to make it your fault [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6572.16s)]
*  to try to make sense of it. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6575.28s)]
*  So what did I do in the moment? [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6577.36s)]
*  I literally did nothing. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6580.08s)]
*  You promised me you watched my sweatshirt. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6582.28s)]
*  And I went like this. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6584.639999999999s)]
*  I kind of was just like looking at him [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6587.759999999999s)]
*  like I knew what it was like to want something [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6589.719999999999s)]
*  and not be able to have it. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6591.4s)]
*  And he's like, you did. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6593.32s)]
*  In the moment I go, I did. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6595.16s)]
*  That sweatshirt is dirty. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6600.0s)]
*  You really wanted it to be clean. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6601.5599999999995s)]
*  It's kind of, he's like, I really did. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6603.32s)]
*  I was like, oh, that's the worst. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6606.08s)]
*  Not joking. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6609.44s)]
*  And then he, by the end, by five minutes later, [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6610.28s)]
*  I didn't say anything. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6612.879999999999s)]
*  He got another sweatshirt. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6613.879999999999s)]
*  We moved on. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6614.919999999999s)]
*  I didn't say I wasn't gonna ruin the moment [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6615.76s)]
*  by being like, see, you could cope or you never asked me. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6618.0s)]
*  But I think in both these moments, [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6621.320000000001s)]
*  whether someone's saying you're stressed [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6623.68s)]
*  or my kid's accusing me, [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6625.08s)]
*  if I think about this a lot in parenting, [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6627.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't have to prove my parenting in a moment. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6629.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't have to prove it to my kid. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6632.400000000001s)]
*  I don't have to prove it because my mother-in-law [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6633.96s)]
*  is watching. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6635.52s)]
*  I trust myself way more than I trust one single moment [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6636.64s)]
*  to represent everything about me. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6641.84s)]
*  And I think when we can gain a little bit of that confidence, [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6644.2s)]
*  we have a lot more freedom to just be effective [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6647.12s)]
*  and to also know there's a moment to do nothing. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6650.639999999999s)]
*  And then if something's a chronic issue, [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6654.16s)]
*  if my son's chronically blaming me, [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6655.5199999999995s)]
*  when things are less heated, I'm gonna say to him, [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6657.76s)]
*  something and a calm moment. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6660.72s)]
*  So super important and novel approaches [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6664.04s)]
*  to things that I think everybody deals with, [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6666.76s)]
*  kids in the picture or not. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6670.5599999999995s)]
*  My audience sometimes gets angry with me [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6674.36s)]
*  when I ask very long extended questions, [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6676.2s)]
*  but could I just share with you something I learned [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6679.5599999999995s)]
*  about an experiment? [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6683.84s)]
*  Because I think it blew my mind. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6684.88s)]
*  I won't take long. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6688.24s)]
*  There's a imaging experiment. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6690.88s)]
*  So you put people in a scanner, [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6692.639999999999s)]
*  they image their brain, see which areas are active, FMRI. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6693.88s)]
*  There's a really wild experiment [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6698.24s)]
*  where they bring people in for the scan. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6700.04s)]
*  They don't tell them why they're there. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6701.88s)]
*  And they tell them they're gonna be paid $30. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6704.400000000001s)]
*  And they set out three $10 bills. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6706.12s)]
*  Maybe you know this experiment. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6709.08s)]
*  Then they go into the scanner and then they come out [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6711.04s)]
*  and then the researcher leaves [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6713.88s)]
*  and there's a discussion, et cetera, et cetera. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6715.04s)]
*  And at some point, one of the $10 bills [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6716.64s)]
*  is removed by the researcher. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6718.76s)]
*  And people are told at the end of the experiment, [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6721.08s)]
*  you took one of the $10 bills. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6726.400000000001s)]
*  And they're like, no, I didn't, because they didn't. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6728.92s)]
*  Nobody says you're right. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6731.72s)]
*  But then they re-image them. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6733.92s)]
*  And they compare that to a condition in other subjects [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6738.68s)]
*  where people actually did a little sneaky steal [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6741.88s)]
*  during a money game. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6744.56s)]
*  And the same areas of the brain light up [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6746.0s)]
*  that we think are associated with guilt. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6748.76s)]
*  In other words, if somebody is told that they did something, [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6753.56s)]
*  even if they know they didn't, [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6757.4400000000005s)]
*  there are aspects of brain circuitry [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6759.24s)]
*  that reflect a quote unquote feeling of guilt. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6762.0s)]
*  It's like it introduces this question about reality. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6765.16s)]
*  And so they can know with 100% certainty, [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6767.8s)]
*  you can know with 100% certainty [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6770.16s)]
*  that you did not do something. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6771.96s)]
*  And yet it starts to introduce these questions [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6773.92s)]
*  about how you gauge reality. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6775.8s)]
*  Simply because somebody you just met a few minutes earlier, [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6778.08s)]
*  yes, in a position of authority, [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6780.72s)]
*  they're the researcher, you're the subject, et cetera, [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6782.68s)]
*  told you that you did it. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6785.52s)]
*  I think this has huge implications [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6787.0s)]
*  for parent-child relationships, for romantic relationships, [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6789.2s)]
*  for workplace relationships, [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6792.6s)]
*  for real bias in the outside world. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6793.4400000000005s)]
*  You can imagine if you're told your whole life [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6796.04s)]
*  that you're a piece of garbage [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6797.6s)]
*  or that you're part of a bad group or something like this. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6798.76s)]
*  I'm not trying to get political here. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6801.2s)]
*  You could come to believe that [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6802.6s)]
*  at a level that is biological, [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6804.320000000001s)]
*  even if cognitively doesn't make sense. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6806.4800000000005s)]
*  So this is where I think about this challenging boundary [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6809.360000000001s)]
*  between knowing what we know, being a container, [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6814.280000000001s)]
*  staying in our frame, [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6817.12s)]
*  pick your favorite lingo around this. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6818.4400000000005s)]
*  And the fact that words and the emotions of other people [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6821.44s)]
*  really do have the capacity to rewire us on the inside. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6825.08s)]
*  You know, a question I'd have about that study, [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6831.04s)]
*  I'd be really curious if there was variation among subjects [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6833.719999999999s)]
*  where some people, that guilt part lit up a lot more. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6838.0s)]
*  Okay, so you reminded me. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6840.879999999999s)]
*  So this is the wild part. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6842.0s)]
*  The distribution of kind of like people who have this, [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6843.5599999999995s)]
*  by the way, folks, there aren't single brain areas [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6849.52s)]
*  for whole emotions, [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6851.160000000001s)]
*  but let's just for sake of simplicity here, [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6852.080000000001s)]
*  that have the guilt area activated, [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6854.8s)]
*  even when they didn't take the money. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6856.96s)]
*  The entire population of subjects [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6858.8s)]
*  doesn't experience that to the same degree. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6860.320000000001s)]
*  You have these people for whom it's [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6861.8s)]
*  very high amplitude response and others who aren't. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6864.68s)]
*  Now, I don't recall, and I need to go back [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6867.240000000001s)]
*  and look at the study if it divided according to male female, [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6868.96s)]
*  because earlier you said that this tendency- [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6871.8s)]
*  I would bet a million dollars [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6874.4400000000005s)]
*  that if I got to know those people, [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6876.6s)]
*  the people who really light up [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6878.04s)]
*  have a lot of focus on gazing out [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6880.8s)]
*  and determining their inner reality [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6883.24s)]
*  by what other people think about them. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6884.96s)]
*  And the people who did not light up as much [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6887.12s)]
*  are the people who gaze in [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6889.48s)]
*  and have a deep sense of themselves, [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6890.96s)]
*  even in the face of kind of a lack of validation [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6894.28s)]
*  or even in the face of criticism. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6898.52s)]
*  I would bet my money on that psychological kind of, [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6900.2s)]
*  is that a moderator or a mediator? [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6903.64s)]
*  I don't know, you would tell me. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6905.32s)]
*  So I'd be very curious about that. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6906.48s)]
*  Great, well, I have no skin in the game. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6908.16s)]
*  Like I didn't run this study and I'll go back [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6910.08s)]
*  and check it out. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6912.2s)]
*  And it's a collection of studies. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6913.04s)]
*  And I hadn't known about this. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6914.48s)]
*  I mean, I read the neuroscience literature, [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6915.719999999999s)]
*  but I hadn't known about this. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6917.639999999999s)]
*  I find it like a complete yes, of course, on the one hand, [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6918.48s)]
*  and also super surprising on the other, [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6923.759999999999s)]
*  and just oh, so cool in the sense that it's informative. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6926.0s)]
*  And it's making me think that some people [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6930.2s)]
*  really need to do the work of paying more attention [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6932.759999999999s)]
*  to other people's emotions and feeling them [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6935.12s)]
*  a little bit more. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6937.48s)]
*  And other people probably need to do the exact opposite. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6938.32s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6941.4s)]
*  And to me, like I always, I say this to people I manage. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6942.64s)]
*  I say, like, I think about this in general with adults. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6945.76s)]
*  I think such an empowering thing as an adult [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6949.84s)]
*  is just to know where you are in any given scale. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6952.4s)]
*  So for me, as a leader, I'm always gas. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6956.0s)]
*  I'm like, go, go, go, we can do this. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6958.68s)]
*  We can get this accomplished. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6960.16s)]
*  I'm probably like pretty far in that. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6961.16s)]
*  And given that, I know it's really important for me [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6964.04s)]
*  to have people around me who sometimes say like, [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6966.92s)]
*  whoa, let's look at this first, right? [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6969.12s)]
*  I also know that sometimes if I do have a like, [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6972.64s)]
*  maybe I should slow this down, [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6976.44s)]
*  I should like really listen to that [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6977.76s)]
*  because that's like not right. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6979.28s)]
*  But knowing where I am on a scale is important. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6980.72s)]
*  I talk about someone that I manage [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6984.0s)]
*  who she really needs to be more direct [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6986.44s)]
*  with the people she manages. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6988.2s)]
*  Just like, you know, like sometimes ask questions [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6989.24s)]
*  when she really wants statements [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6991.68s)]
*  and can have a little higher standard. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6993.64s)]
*  And I think it's helpful to know where she is in that scale [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6995.64s)]
*  because I remember saying like, [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=6998.5199999999995s)]
*  I want you to go as far as you can [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7000.0199999999995s)]
*  toward the other direction without being disrespectful [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7001.36s)]
*  because it's almost impossible to do that, right? [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7003.5199999999995s)]
*  And so I think for adults to know, [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7007.04s)]
*  let's say I gaze in or I more gaze out, [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7009.28s)]
*  neither is better or worse. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7011.5199999999995s)]
*  Probably again, mental health and resilience [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7013.32s)]
*  is about having just a lack of rigidity. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7016.36s)]
*  And so to say, what is my starting point? [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7018.92s)]
*  Like anyone listening, what is my starting point? [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7020.92s)]
*  There's no morality. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7023.88s)]
*  It's literally not better or worse. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7024.72s)]
*  It just gives me information about which direction [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7026.48s)]
*  to experiment with. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7030.08s)]
*  And I like to make this a concrete experiment, right? [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7031.44s)]
*  So let's say you are someone who tends to gaze out [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7034.12s)]
*  before you gaze in. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7038.04s)]
*  And you're always like, I can't do this thing I want to do [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7039.12s)]
*  because it would inconvenience someone. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7041.56s)]
*  I told this story the other day on my Instagram [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7043.16s)]
*  and people went bananas about it. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7044.88s)]
*  I was at the airport and I got a cup of coffee in the morning [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7047.16s)]
*  and I liked my coffee with just like [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7052.12s)]
*  a really little bit of milk, right? [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7053.44s)]
*  And I know to specify it if I'm asking someone else. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7055.16s)]
*  I went to the counter and I said, [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7058.0s)]
*  hey, can I get a medium coffee, not black, [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7059.04s)]
*  just a little, little bit of milk, pretty close to black. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7061.72s)]
*  Sure, no problem. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7064.16s)]
*  I go, I wait in line, then it's on the counter. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7065.2s)]
*  I pick it up, Becky. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7067.16s)]
*  And it's like light as can be. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7068.88s)]
*  I got back online. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7074.76s)]
*  I brought the coffee and I said, hey, [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7076.44s)]
*  I asked for this, I know there's a lot of people [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7079.16s)]
*  that probably got lost. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7080.76s)]
*  I asked for this darker, could you pour out [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7082.12s)]
*  a good amount of this and then refill it with coffee? [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7084.8s)]
*  The person, who knows if it could have gone [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7087.400000000001s)]
*  differently, different, oh, right, no problem. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7089.56s)]
*  Here you go. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7092.320000000001s)]
*  This happens with things that are so much bigger than coffee [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7094.64s)]
*  but the coffee example is such a good one [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7096.88s)]
*  because what I'm doing in that moment is I'm saying [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7099.2s)]
*  I'm allowed to have my coffee the way I wanted it [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7102.88s)]
*  and ask for it even if it's awkward [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7106.04s)]
*  or inconveniences the other person. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7110.08s)]
*  Now, can people be on the opposite extreme [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7112.96s)]
*  and can someone hear this and be like, [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7115.2s)]
*  I probably need to do a little bit less of my own needs. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7117.24s)]
*  That's what I'm saying, you have to know you are. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7121.72s)]
*  But what I have found at least with moms [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7123.44s)]
*  is the idea of, oh, you know, I asked for almond milk [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7127.56s)]
*  and this is whole milk. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7132.84s)]
*  I used to give my clients this experiment [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7135.240000000001s)]
*  who had this struggle. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7137.320000000001s)]
*  I said, I want you at the grocery store. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7138.280000000001s)]
*  After you're basically done checking out, [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7142.120000000001s)]
*  to say, oh, you know what, [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7144.4400000000005s)]
*  I actually don't need those paper towels. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7146.96s)]
*  I can't even tell you. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7149.0s)]
*  People are like, I can't do that, I can't return it. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7150.280000000001s)]
*  Oh my goodness, it was like a panic attack [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7153.280000000001s)]
*  and the panic, the panic feeling [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7155.240000000001s)]
*  is that would be a completely new circuit. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7158.0s)]
*  That would be me saying I'm willing to do something [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7160.68s)]
*  to meet my own needs. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7164.16s)]
*  I actually don't need that paper towel. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7165.12s)]
*  Even though it could get an eye roll [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7168.08s)]
*  or inconvenience temporarily someone else. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7171.639999999999s)]
*  Those little experiments and it might be the opposite. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7175.599999999999s)]
*  It might be saying to my partner tonight, [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7178.4s)]
*  you know what, we always sit down and talk about my work. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7180.5599999999995s)]
*  And I actually did have a stressful day, but you know what? [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7184.08s)]
*  I wanna hear about your day, you go first. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7188.04s)]
*  That's also an experiment. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7189.88s)]
*  And for someone who's on that extreme, [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7191.12s)]
*  they're gonna also have a panic attack. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7193.16s)]
*  They're gonna be like, this is deeply uncomfortable. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7194.48s)]
*  But just knowing where you are in the spectrum [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7196.92s)]
*  gives you the information you need [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7198.96s)]
*  to get a little bit of balance. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7201.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's clearly a distribution. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7202.639999999999s)]
*  And whether or not it's a binary distribution [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7205.28s)]
*  or it's kind of like a normal distribution, I don't know, [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7208.8s)]
*  but there's clearly variants here [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7211.599999999999s)]
*  from one person to the next. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7213.72s)]
*  And probably even depending on how well rested we are [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7214.92s)]
*  and all the rest. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7217.8s)]
*  But I do think that we do kind of fall into phenotypes [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7218.639999999999s)]
*  of prone to reacting to other people's emotions [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7221.56s)]
*  without hearing and listening to [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7225.68s)]
*  and responding to hours first, like truly hours first, [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7228.240000000001s)]
*  versus people who are just really out there. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7231.84s)]
*  I realized it's very different [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7234.6s)]
*  than any other kind of relationship. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7236.320000000001s)]
*  But when I first went from being a postdoc [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7237.56s)]
*  to having my own laboratory, the chair in my department, [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7239.320000000001s)]
*  my chairman in one department anyway, he said, [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7241.8s)]
*  you should get a great big desk that's really thick. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7244.080000000001s)]
*  I was like, yeah, why? [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7248.0s)]
*  I mean, I get it. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7250.240000000001s)]
*  I don't wanna be sitting right next to your employees [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7251.08s)]
*  or something, but why so that? [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7252.92s)]
*  And he goes, so that when they cry, [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7254.48s)]
*  you won't feel like you need to cry or take care of them. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7256.28s)]
*  You'll just slide the Kleenex across the desk. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7259.36s)]
*  And I was like, are you kidding? [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7262.68s)]
*  And he was like, no. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7264.64s)]
*  And then years later, I looked back [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7265.48s)]
*  and I realized I understood what he was saying. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7270.36s)]
*  I mean, he didn't know me at all, [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7272.12s)]
*  but he was just saying probably something about himself, [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7273.2s)]
*  which is people are gonna come into your office, [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7275.2s)]
*  they're gonna cry. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7277.92s)]
*  It does happen. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7279.24s)]
*  And you're going to need to be the boss, [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7280.48s)]
*  which is to be supportive and empathic, [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7283.719999999999s)]
*  but like you can't get pulled into it [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7286.28s)]
*  because they might be crying about something [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7287.599999999999s)]
*  they don't like about the lab [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7289.5599999999995s)]
*  or about something not happening the way they want it. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7290.799999999999s)]
*  I mean, who could imagine any other reason to cry [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7292.839999999999s)]
*  in your boss's office, [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7295.44s)]
*  but maybe they have a family issue. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7296.599999999999s)]
*  And so you have to remember you're the boss. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7297.959999999999s)]
*  And I thought, oh, that's interesting. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7301.2s)]
*  I ended up with a desk that was kind of medium in width, [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7304.0s)]
*  but I think that nowadays there's a lot more [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7307.04s)]
*  kind of bleeding of roles. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7310.76s)]
*  And it used to be that everyone got really dressed up [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7312.4s)]
*  for work, now dressing down as like common [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7316.96s)]
*  in certain circumstances and not others. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7320.24s)]
*  I think that there's a lot of kind of lack of clarity [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7321.88s)]
*  about, here we go again, power and authority, [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7325.92s)]
*  but also kind of staying in our own frame [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7331.5199999999995s)]
*  versus taking on someone else's frame. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7334.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7335.84s)]
*  I have a friend who runs a pretty large business [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7336.68s)]
*  and he did the same experiment that you did [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7338.8s)]
*  of asking people how he could do better. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7340.52s)]
*  But first he unfortunately made the mistake [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7343.68s)]
*  of asking people how they felt about being there. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7346.64s)]
*  And they ended up making one of these emotion clouds [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7349.360000000001s)]
*  where they took, everyone filled out a thing [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7352.08s)]
*  and wrote what the most dominant emotions were. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7354.0s)]
*  And then he told this story, like, call me late at night. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7356.240000000001s)]
*  He sits down and they're gonna present this as data [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7359.400000000001s)]
*  in front of everybody. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7362.12s)]
*  And this emotion cloud comes up [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7363.4800000000005s)]
*  and the biggest bubble in the middle just says stress. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7365.2s)]
*  And he was mortified, right? [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7369.16s)]
*  But he learned that they all feel really, really, [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7371.48s)]
*  really stressed. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7373.4s)]
*  That sort of exercise would never have happened [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7374.48s)]
*  10, 15 years ago. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7378.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7380.28s)]
*  It's like, yeah, like I won't say what profession he's in [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7381.12s)]
*  for sake of privacy, but like, it's a profession [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7383.599999999999s)]
*  where stress is part of the process [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7385.72s)]
*  and you don't kind of get the certificate at the end, [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7388.28s)]
*  so to speak, if you don't experience stress. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7391.0s)]
*  But this actually relates to what we started with [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7393.0s)]
*  in a way, I'm gonna circle it back there, [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7394.56s)]
*  which is, and cause I hear this a lot, [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7396.8s)]
*  kind of some kids these days, [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7401.64s)]
*  they don't know how to tolerate stress [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7403.240000000001s)]
*  or they're always overwhelmed. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7406.4400000000005s)]
*  But part of it is, again, maybe this is my MGI, [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7408.120000000001s)]
*  maybe they haven't been told the right story [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7411.080000000001s)]
*  about stress or anxiety. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7412.6s)]
*  This came up with my kids the other day. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7415.96s)]
*  My older son had his first basketball game of the season [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7418.080000000001s)]
*  and he goes, oh, I'm really nervous, [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7421.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm feeling a little anxious. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7423.0s)]
*  And it's just so interesting, [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7424.08s)]
*  the way we respond in little ways to our kids [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7425.4s)]
*  in these moments form, [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7427.84s)]
*  the way they end up thinking about those feelings later on. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7430.72s)]
*  I said, well, of course you're nervous. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7433.68s)]
*  Being nervous means you care. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7435.88s)]
*  You really care about basketball, right? [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7437.16s)]
*  And obviously we've had many conversations [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7439.68s)]
*  about what feelings mean, but it was so interesting. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7441.04s)]
*  I watched him go, yeah, I do care. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7443.0s)]
*  Kind of in that little sentence, [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7446.28s)]
*  being nervous means you care. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7448.36s)]
*  I mean, think about it, you're never nervous [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7450.84s)]
*  about anything you don't care about, right? [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7452.12s)]
*  If being nervous means I care, [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7455.08s)]
*  I have a story to understand it. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7458.0s)]
*  I now inherently feel like the feeling is normal. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7460.16s)]
*  I'm almost proud, like, yeah, I do care. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7462.88s)]
*  My relationship with that feeling [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7467.32s)]
*  is going to be so different than if my parents are like, [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7470.08s)]
*  why are you nervous? [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7472.5199999999995s)]
*  There's nothing to be nervous about. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7473.36s)]
*  Or, oh, you're nervous? [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7474.32s)]
*  Oh, does that mean you're not gonna play well? [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7475.599999999999s)]
*  Oh my goodness, are you gonna miss your foul shots? [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7476.96s)]
*  I mean, so in the first, right, [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7478.68s)]
*  my kid feels like being nervous is wrong, [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7480.84s)]
*  so I just set them up to feel like [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7483.0s)]
*  they're feeling the wrong feeling [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7485.24s)]
*  when they're feeling nervous going on. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7486.56s)]
*  In the second, I'm laying on my anxiety to their nervousness. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7488.12s)]
*  Not a great combo, but the stories we tell matter. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7491.6s)]
*  So in the workplace, you're stressed. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7494.6s)]
*  Yeah, you know, actually this makes me think, [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7496.2s)]
*  maybe not right now, one more time, [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7498.24s)]
*  it would be really helpful to talk about what is stress? [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7500.8s)]
*  Why do we feel stress? [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7504.0s)]
*  How do we talk to ourselves when we feel stress? [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7506.08s)]
*  Does anyone here know the way you talk to yourself [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7508.24s)]
*  when you're stressed has the power [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7511.32s)]
*  to make stress feel a little smaller or a little bigger? [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7514.28s)]
*  That's really interesting. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7518.719999999999s)]
*  I wonder, does anyone here use a session? [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7519.92s)]
*  Should we do something in the workplace [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7521.84s)]
*  about how to deal with stress? [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7523.28s)]
*  Because you're right. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7524.96s)]
*  This is a stressful job. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7527.24s)]
*  And this is where I don't think about power, but authority. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7529.0s)]
*  And I wanna own that and let you know that [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7532.12s)]
*  stress comes along with this type of job. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7534.719999999999s)]
*  I'm making this up. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7537.68s)]
*  And this is why you get paid pretty well. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7538.52s)]
*  And this is why, you know, whatever else could be true. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7540.76s)]
*  But one of my jobs is not just being honest, [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7543.52s)]
*  but actually helping everyone develop the best skills [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7546.08s)]
*  that maybe no one ever taught them before to manage stress. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7548.56s)]
*  Let me know if that's of interest. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7551.160000000001s)]
*  I just think about that. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7552.56s)]
*  The whole mood just changed. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7554.04s)]
*  You kind of own your authority and you own the story. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7555.280000000001s)]
*  And I think whether you're talking about being a CEO [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7559.64s)]
*  or being a parent, it's actually all the same. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7561.56s)]
*  That makes sense. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7565.360000000001s)]
*  I have a rule, which is if my pulse rate [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7566.92s)]
*  goes above a certain limit, my thumbs stop working. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7569.0s)]
*  Meaning I won't allow myself to text. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7572.28s)]
*  I don't talk on the phone. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7574.64s)]
*  I'll just go in the bathroom and just sit for a second [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7576.76s)]
*  if I have to, but that's rare. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7579.56s)]
*  Typically I just, I'm like, I have a rule. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7580.76s)]
*  My heart rate goes up, my thumbs don't work. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7582.4400000000005s)]
*  What do you do? [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7584.72s)]
*  I just do nothing. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7585.8s)]
*  I follow the do nothing thing. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7586.92s)]
*  I just wait. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7588.16s)]
*  I mean, I also have a rule, which is [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7589.04s)]
*  unless somebody's hemorrhaging right in front of me, [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7590.52s)]
*  it usually can wait. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7593.4400000000005s)]
*  Drives people crazy, but they thank me later. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7595.0s)]
*  Like unless somebody's literally hemorrhaging, [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7598.0s)]
*  like I can pause my response [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7599.64s)]
*  because I'm a kind of like move fast, [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7603.56s)]
*  get things done kind of person. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7605.8s)]
*  And actually it was taught to me by a chairman [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7608.56s)]
*  of a major university in New York home city, [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7611.6s)]
*  of New York city. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7613.84s)]
*  He said, there's always more time. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7614.68s)]
*  And I said, that's ridiculous. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7617.0s)]
*  He said, unless somebody's hemorrhaging [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7617.88s)]
*  right in front of you, there's always more time. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7619.16s)]
*  Going back to my daughter, it's one of the mantras [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7621.4s)]
*  that's been really helpful for me [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7623.2s)]
*  as someone who, again, just knowing myself, [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7624.36s)]
*  I always like to go, go, go. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7626.799999999999s)]
*  I get so much pleasure, probably identity value [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7628.96s)]
*  from doing things. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7633.04s)]
*  And so a by-product of that is I always kind of feel [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7634.599999999999s)]
*  like I'm in a rush because my body craves movement [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7637.759999999999s)]
*  and checking things off. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7641.04s)]
*  But being in a rush is never terribly helpful [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7642.719999999999s)]
*  in close relationships. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7646.24s)]
*  No one likes to feel like, come on, [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7647.639999999999s)]
*  can you get to the end of the story or, you know, [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7648.92s)]
*  that's not good. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7650.48s)]
*  So sometimes I think efficiency and relationship building [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7651.48s)]
*  are like antithetical. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7655.759999999999s)]
*  Amen, a thousand times over. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7657.919999999999s)]
*  No, I don't think we can be efficient in relationships. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7660.24s)]
*  It's like efficiency in other things is beautiful. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7664.2s)]
*  Well, it's a unitary experience being efficient [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7667.48s)]
*  in relation. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7670.12s)]
*  And so like when I can be in efficiency a lot, [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7670.959999999999s)]
*  mode a lot, and it's something that I have to really think [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7673.48s)]
*  when I'm going home to my closest relationships. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7676.44s)]
*  And it's interesting now that I work so much more [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7678.679999999999s)]
*  than I used to, it's almost reinforcing the efficiency mode. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7680.2s)]
*  So I really know I have to, you know, my own therapy, [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7683.88s)]
*  like really work on, like, that's not a value of mine [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7686.76s)]
*  all the time at work, maybe sometimes. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7690.599999999999s)]
*  Even there, sometimes you gotta get out of it [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7692.32s)]
*  to connect to people, right? [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7693.76s)]
*  And so that is something, again, where like knowing [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7695.96s)]
*  where I am on that scale, asking people to call me out. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7700.8s)]
*  Oh, mom, you're rushing me at night. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7704.76s)]
*  Becky, I wanna tell you the whole story. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7706.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm not just trying to give you the TLDR. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7708.72s)]
*  I want the experience of telling you the story. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7711.04s)]
*  I'm like, right, I'm doing that thing. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7713.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, slowing down is rarely a mistake. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7716.2s)]
*  That's really true. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7719.08s)]
*  I guess occasionally, but rarely a mistake. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7719.92s)]
*  It's really true. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7722.2s)]
*  I'd like to talk a little bit about technology. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7724.04s)]
*  I know this is a growing interest of yours. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7726.320000000001s)]
*  I've been thinking a little bit based on our earlier discussion [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7728.96s)]
*  about sort of people who are in their own container [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7733.68s)]
*  or sensing what's going on inside them [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7735.96s)]
*  prior to paying attention to and sensing what's going on [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7737.96s)]
*  in other people, because clearly both are important. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7741.2s)]
*  I don't like this idea that it's like one or the other. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7744.0s)]
*  But with the advent of text messaging, [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7747.92s)]
*  so here I'm not gonna talk about social media. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7750.64s)]
*  This is not about social media. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7752.6s)]
*  With text messaging, first of all, [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7754.6s)]
*  this is the first time in human evolution [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7757.4s)]
*  that humans have written with their thumbs. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7758.8s)]
*  That's weird, been kind of quirky reflection. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7761.56s)]
*  But the other one is this is the first time [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7764.44s)]
*  in human evolution, meaning very recently [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7766.28s)]
*  that we are aware of what's going on [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7768.16s)]
*  with so many other people and we're expected to at least [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7770.5199999999995s)]
*  know it and perhaps even respond to it. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7774.2s)]
*  I mean, it's just, I know people younger than 30 [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7776.2s)]
*  are probably gonna wait. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7779.96s)]
*  No, it's always been this way, but it wasn't always this way. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7780.8s)]
*  Clearly our brain has adapted to this new format, [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7782.88s)]
*  but it did not evolve in this format, [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7785.4s)]
*  whereby you're getting on a plane [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7788.08s)]
*  and you look at your phone and you are aware [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7790.44s)]
*  of the movements and requests and maybe kind statements, [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7792.44s)]
*  et cetera, from other people. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7796.879999999999s)]
*  We are tethered in so many ways. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7798.24s)]
*  And that means that our brain is really tethered [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7801.12s)]
*  to the states of others, their emotional states, [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7803.759999999999s)]
*  their physical states, where they are. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7806.919999999999s)]
*  You said, and I'll keep repeating it [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7808.5599999999995s)]
*  because I love it so much, [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7810.04s)]
*  the more you can locate somebody, [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7810.879999999999s)]
*  the more it reflects their values. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7813.44s)]
*  So being able to locate somebody in space and time [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7815.12s)]
*  and understand how bounded they are [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7817.839999999999s)]
*  or not to their own emotions or you're as fantastic [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7819.48s)]
*  but the fact that you have 10 people in your phone [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7822.599999999999s)]
*  that you're aware of, [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7824.879999999999s)]
*  you're not even supposed to be aware of 10 people at once, [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7827.2s)]
*  except the 10 people perhaps around you [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7829.599999999999s)]
*  on the boarding a plane. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7831.12s)]
*  So we're being forced to navigate a new landscape [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7834.16s)]
*  with all this. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7837.679999999999s)]
*  After this conversation folds, we'll look at our phones. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7839.759999999999s)]
*  You couldn't have that many, I guarantee one thing, [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7843.799999999999s)]
*  no matter how many text messages or few text messages [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7846.0s)]
*  you have, it's far more conversations, if you will, [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7848.5199999999995s)]
*  than you could possibly have by phone at once. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7852.0s)]
*  Yep. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7854.76s)]
*  So in the old days, you left messages [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7855.64s)]
*  and you'd get on the phone when you could. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7858.08s)]
*  I'm not saying we go back to that, [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7860.08s)]
*  but I think we might be asking ourselves to do something [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7861.28s)]
*  that is impossibly hard and maybe even bad for us. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7864.36s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know how apocalyptic [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7870.44s)]
*  you want me to get about this, [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7874.68s)]
*  but I think I actually, [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7876.48s)]
*  my husband and I were talking about phones [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7878.68s)]
*  and text and social media and AI, [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7880.84s)]
*  and I brought up something to him. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7886.4800000000005s)]
*  He's like, I don't think I've, [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7887.32s)]
*  and all the arguments I've heard, I haven't heard that, [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7888.28s)]
*  where I feel like we're changing in a dramatic way [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7889.92s)]
*  our basic evolutionary drive around attachment [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7896.28s)]
*  in a way where attachment has always been [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7900.68s)]
*  the primary evolutionary drive of humans. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7903.56s)]
*  And with all the different technological shifts [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7906.6s)]
*  there have been, because people would say, [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7909.52s)]
*  oh, there's been this, there's been this. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7910.84s)]
*  What's never been shifted is kind of the nature [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7913.040000000001s)]
*  really of one-to-one human attachment. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7917.360000000001s)]
*  We're entering into something really new, [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7922.160000000001s)]
*  where let's even say text messages, 20 at once, 10 at once. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7924.52s)]
*  Our bodies will always crave what's immediately gratifying [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7929.0s)]
*  over what is long-term good for us. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7934.120000000001s)]
*  It's just, it's, and another way I think about it is [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7936.160000000001s)]
*  our bodies will always choose convenience [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7939.2s)]
*  and ease and gratification over what's good [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7941.48s)]
*  for us long-term. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7943.4s)]
*  So you think about all these pings coming in. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7944.599999999999s)]
*  It's a lot of information, this text, that text, [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7946.48s)]
*  this text, this text. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7948.5199999999995s)]
*  And what you're doing in your circuitry, [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7949.96s)]
*  and over time evolutionarily, [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7952.24s)]
*  is getting used to the multiplicity of relationships, [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7953.72s)]
*  the multiplicity of information. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7956.2s)]
*  It's just more gratifying than one-on-one [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7957.8s)]
*  to the point that one-on-one conversation over text [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7961.16s)]
*  or even in person is gonna have so much more [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7964.639999999999s)]
*  of a gap than it ever has been in terms of how slow, [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7968.88s)]
*  how low-stim and how boring and awkward it is [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7973.84s)]
*  compared to, especially for kids who get this early, [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7980.56s)]
*  the constant information flow [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7983.52s)]
*  and gratification and stimulation. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7985.400000000001s)]
*  I think that's gonna have a profound impact, [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7988.12s)]
*  not right away, but over time. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7990.36s)]
*  And if you add in social media and then if you add in AI, [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7992.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, on the way humans just are even able [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7995.44s)]
*  to relate to each other. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=7999.24s)]
*  So yes, I think like this advancement in technology [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8000.759999999999s)]
*  and what's happening, [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8005.5599999999995s)]
*  I think there's always been a trade-off, always, [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8007.16s)]
*  between how short-term gratifying something is [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8009.5599999999995s)]
*  and how long-term good something is for us. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8012.24s)]
*  Because the things that are really good for humans long-term [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8014.44s)]
*  are the things that involve humans to tolerate frustration. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8017.4s)]
*  I would say that is the most important skill, [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8020.639999999999s)]
*  I think, for kids to learn. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8022.04s)]
*  But the world, more than ever, [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8024.2s)]
*  is built now with insanely low frustration tolerance [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8027.639999999999s)]
*  because we're built for so much information, [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8030.599999999999s)]
*  so much consumption and so much immediate gratification. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8033.04s)]
*  This is actually, I think, [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8035.88s)]
*  the thing that isn't talked about with technology. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8036.72s)]
*  It's why parenting has changed. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8038.24s)]
*  It's why so much of parenting is about making kids happy [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8039.4s)]
*  and their lives easy [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8041.96s)]
*  because there's never been a generation of parents [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8043.2s)]
*  like my generation where our lives are just so much easier. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8045.8s)]
*  We have so much less tolerance for our kids' tantrums [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8050.08s)]
*  because we're on our phones wanting our life to be easier, [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8053.8s)]
*  so we stop the tantrum. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8056.68s)]
*  We make their life easier. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8058.12s)]
*  We make them anxious. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8059.2s)]
*  We make them fragile [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8060.04s)]
*  because of our lowered frustration tolerance. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8061.28s)]
*  So I don't know where we're landing here, [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8063.6s)]
*  but, and by the way, I text. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8065.8s)]
*  I'm not like a purist here. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8068.360000000001s)]
*  I'm a realist. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8070.360000000001s)]
*  I live in the world. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8071.2s)]
*  But I think it's profound how it's changing [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8073.84s)]
*  human interaction and expectations and gratification. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8077.320000000001s)]
*  My colleague Anna Lemke, who wrote Dopamine Nation, [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8081.0s)]
*  cited some data that humans have more free time now [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8084.56s)]
*  across socioeconomic groups, [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8088.52s)]
*  more free time for everybody than ever before, [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8091.08s)]
*  more expectation of immediate gratification. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8094.52s)]
*  And it's not just the texts that we're getting. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8097.64s)]
*  It's, for some people, the texts that they're not getting. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8100.52s)]
*  They're thinking about the people [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8103.4800000000005s)]
*  that they haven't heard back from, et cetera. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8104.44s)]
*  I mean, the number of tethers, right? [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8105.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8108.32s)]
*  The number of tethers is just astonishing. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8109.8s)]
*  I had a conversation with somebody recently [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8115.44s)]
*  that popped to mind where it was a little bit, [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8117.12s)]
*  it was like a low friction one [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8120.16s)]
*  that ended in a really good place where I said, [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8122.08s)]
*  the problem is, I was talking about, [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8125.24s)]
*  there's a little bit of an age gap. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8127.92s)]
*  And I said, the problem is you think slow is low. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8128.96s)]
*  Like what I was saying was I like to just chill. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8131.96s)]
*  This is something I haven't done enough of in my life [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8134.88s)]
*  because I'm a pretty ambitious person [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8136.72s)]
*  and always have been since I was little about everything. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8138.6s)]
*  But I've learned that slow isn't low. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8142.400000000001s)]
*  I love just sitting down and hanging out with the dog [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8146.320000000001s)]
*  or just slowing down. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8150.320000000001s)]
*  And it used to feel like slow was low. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8154.04s)]
*  It used to feel like, oh, nothing's happening [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8156.320000000001s)]
*  or this is depressing or it's boring. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8157.96s)]
*  And I think in recent years, [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8160.72s)]
*  that became more and more the case [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8162.360000000001s)]
*  as I got more and more pulled into technology. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8163.8s)]
*  And then I did a little bit [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8166.16s)]
*  of a technology distancing experiment, if you will. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8167.16s)]
*  I have this wooden box that someone made for me [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8169.92s)]
*  and I put my phones in there. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8171.639999999999s)]
*  And it's so amazing how once you put the phone [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8172.92s)]
*  in a different container, [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8175.48s)]
*  it like completely changes the relationship to it. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8177.44s)]
*  I don't get it, but anyway, again, [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8179.5599999999995s)]
*  physical barriers to take emotional steps, [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8181.5199999999995s)]
*  always a good idea. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8184.16s)]
*  And I just realized like slow isn't low. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8187.84s)]
*  Like slow is awesome. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8189.76s)]
*  So I totally agree that the circuits of our brain [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8191.16s)]
*  have now adapted to expect immediate gratification. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8193.94s)]
*  I like to think, and maybe this is a false wish, [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8196.66s)]
*  but I like to think that there are components of our brain [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8202.18s)]
*  that are hardwired enough through tens or hundreds [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8205.220000000001s)]
*  of thousands of years of evolution [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8208.42s)]
*  that might be able to recognize and appreciate [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8210.34s)]
*  the slow moments and not feel like slow is low, [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8213.58s)]
*  meaning slow is depressing. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8216.94s)]
*  But I do think that if one is weaned in, [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8219.74s)]
*  raised in an environment where you expect things quickly, [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8222.62s)]
*  well then it's gonna feel like the horse in cart [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8226.140000000001s)]
*  compared to the car at some level. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8229.26s)]
*  I do, I agree. I think that's right. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8231.78s)]
*  And I think for parents who have young kids, [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8232.820000000002s)]
*  I think these are such powerful and empowering things [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8235.820000000002s)]
*  to think about when your kids are young [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8239.320000000002s)]
*  because I think it's easy to think, [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8240.7s)]
*  oh, okay, so I'll deal with this when my kid gets a phone. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8242.460000000001s)]
*  It's the circuits around even how your kid [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8247.060000000001s)]
*  will use the phone, [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8249.86s)]
*  how much you're gonna be able to set boundaries, [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8250.78s)]
*  how much you're gonna be able to get with your kid [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8253.539999999999s)]
*  when they get a phone. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8254.86s)]
*  All of these have to do with the patterns early on, right? [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8255.98s)]
*  So if we go back to slow is good, [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8258.7s)]
*  frustration and frustration tolerance [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8262.74s)]
*  is the name of the game. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8265.7s)]
*  It requires a lot of inconvenient moments [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8267.98s)]
*  that matter so much for how not only your kid [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8270.74s)]
*  learns to tolerate the frustration inherent in life, [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8274.98s)]
*  but I think this is really important, [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8278.7s)]
*  how your kid learns to feel capable. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8280.1s)]
*  Kids only develop capability [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8281.78s)]
*  from watching themselves get through hard things. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8284.58s)]
*  They don't develop capability by being successful ever. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8287.300000000001s)]
*  In some ways, it builds up this pressure and a fragility [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8290.02s)]
*  if that's been the only thing they have. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8293.42s)]
*  And when we think about this whole generation [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8295.58s)]
*  who's so anxious, kind of so fragile, [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8297.460000000001s)]
*  I really believe the antidote to anxiety is capability. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8300.220000000001s)]
*  And we, and I'll give an example, [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8304.54s)]
*  we steal our kids' capability all the time [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8306.78s)]
*  when they're young in the name of short-term convenience [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8310.5s)]
*  for everyone. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8312.94s)]
*  So here's an example. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8313.779999999999s)]
*  I remember this day, my oldest is now 13, [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8315.18s)]
*  he was like three and he was really into puzzles [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8317.9s)]
*  when he was three. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8319.58s)]
*  Puzzles are like really hard, right? [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8321.18s)]
*  He was working on it, something like, I can't do it, [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8323.74s)]
*  classic wine, which I just want everyone to know, [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8327.34s)]
*  no part of me is like, I love that sound. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8330.1s)]
*  No, nobody likes whining, okay? [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8332.74s)]
*  But to me, those are our like bang for our buck moments. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8336.5s)]
*  You know, they're not our easy moments, [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8340.46s)]
*  they're our bang for our buck. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8341.74s)]
*  My kid is gonna learn something about how to deal [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8342.58s)]
*  with situations they don't think they're capable [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8345.5s)]
*  of completing. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8348.18s)]
*  That is such an important lesson. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8349.54s)]
*  And I have a fork in the road. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8352.66s)]
*  I can either do the puzzle for him, [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8353.7s)]
*  which gives me short-term convenience, stops the meltdown. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8355.74s)]
*  But beyond frustration tolerance, [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8361.02s)]
*  like one of the things I really remember thinking about [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8363.02s)]
*  when my kid was young is if I do it for him, [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8365.62s)]
*  I'm stealing his capability. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8370.82s)]
*  Because if he can get through this [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8374.300000000001s)]
*  and kind of get to the point where he says, [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8377.300000000001s)]
*  I did a puzzle I didn't think I could do, [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8379.62s)]
*  that's incredible. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8382.42s)]
*  So I remember this because it felt so, [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8383.82s)]
*  he's still whined, but there are these moments as a parent, [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8387.980000000001s)]
*  and this is what I like to help parents with, [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8390.220000000001s)]
*  our wins are not based on our kids' reactions. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8392.02s)]
*  Our wins happen when you just know [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8395.06s)]
*  there's this amazing feeling you have as a parent. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8396.22s)]
*  I know that was important. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8398.539999999999s)]
*  I know it. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8399.98s)]
*  And I remember saying to him with this puzzle situation, [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8400.98s)]
*  sweetie, I'm not gonna do the puzzle for you. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8404.179999999998s)]
*  And I wanna tell you why. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8407.019999999999s)]
*  The feeling you get when you think you can't do something, [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8410.46s)]
*  kind of take a deep breath, maybe take a break, [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8414.58s)]
*  maybe even the next day, watch yourself do that thing [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8417.259999999998s)]
*  is literally the best feeling in the world. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8422.26s)]
*  It is the best feeling, it becomes addictive, [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8424.78s)]
*  and I will not take that feeling away from you [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8427.460000000001s)]
*  because I believe you're gonna get it. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8431.34s)]
*  I could cry. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8433.5s)]
*  And one of the things, [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8435.5s)]
*  I feel like people hear the story like, [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8437.42s)]
*  finally, okay, Becky, great. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8438.62s)]
*  I do not do that all the time. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8440.5s)]
*  Sometimes I finish the puzzle. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8441.5s)]
*  But when we think about what we want [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8443.18s)]
*  for our kids later in life, [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8445.02s)]
*  it might be, no, I'm not getting you a phone yet. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8447.34s)]
*  How a kid reacts to that situation [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8449.66s)]
*  is not just about a phone. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8452.78s)]
*  It's kind of, well, have you always just done the thing [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8454.5s)]
*  for me? [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8456.9s)]
*  Have you always just given me what I want? [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8457.74s)]
*  Do I have any ability to feel like I can tolerate [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8459.380000000001s)]
*  frustration and wait and figure things out? [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8462.66s)]
*  That all layers into how kids react to not getting a phone, [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8466.02s)]
*  how kids approach hard math problems, [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8470.460000000001s)]
*  how kids do or do not sit down to start their English essay, [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8472.7s)]
*  that is difficult to do. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8475.86s)]
*  And all that stuff, you can start building those skills [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8477.74s)]
*  and I know teenage years don't get me wrong, [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8480.82s)]
*  but the leg up your kid has at 14, [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8482.66s)]
*  when they've been basically building those life [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8486.18s)]
*  and academic skills from the start [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8488.58s)]
*  and they've built their identity around capability, [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8490.34s)]
*  like that's what I wanna give every parent [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8494.1s)]
*  and every kid in the world. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8497.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's awesome. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8499.5s)]
*  I said it last time we spoke, I'll say it again. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8500.94s)]
*  If you're thinking of adopting, [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8502.98s)]
*  I'd be happy to put myself up for adoption. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8504.34s)]
*  It's such a beautiful philosophy and stance [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8507.02s)]
*  to take around effort and frustration. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8510.14s)]
*  I mean, again, this isn't about my life, [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8511.98s)]
*  but I feel so blessed that came up in science [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8514.099999999999s)]
*  where things take forever. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8516.66s)]
*  You can work two years on a project and then discover, [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8518.5s)]
*  you do the right control experiment [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8521.06s)]
*  and you're like, we got nothing. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8522.42s)]
*  Like literally, we have nothing. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8524.699999999999s)]
*  And there still isn't a tendency to publish [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8528.619999999999s)]
*  what are called negative results, [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8530.34s)]
*  which aren't bad results, but where you basically got nothing. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8531.42s)]
*  You can find a flaw in the reagents you're using, [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8533.74s)]
*  you got nothing, you're starting again. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8536.22s)]
*  And to have that a few times and to have some papers [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8538.1s)]
*  take two, three, four years to get accepted, [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8542.66s)]
*  other papers, six months. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8544.7s)]
*  I'll tell you, the six months feels really short. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8545.66s)]
*  But these days we get so much immediate gratification. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8547.78s)]
*  The other day I was staying at a hotel [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8551.74s)]
*  and I ordered food in. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8553.1s)]
*  I don't do it that often. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8556.54s)]
*  I was like, I really want like a poke bowl. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8557.98s)]
*  There's that poke bowl place. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8560.220000000001s)]
*  It was there in 11 minutes. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8561.54s)]
*  I was like, whoa, like, this is so wild. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8563.74s)]
*  I was like, I gotta be careful. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8565.86s)]
*  Not because I'll overeat poke bowls. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8567.46s)]
*  You can only have so many poke bowls, [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8568.98s)]
*  but it's like, you just, it's there. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8570.779999999999s)]
*  Convenience. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8573.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8574.539999999999s)]
*  It's incredible. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8575.38s)]
*  I remember. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8576.939999999999s)]
*  And sad and scary and exciting and all the things. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8577.779999999999s)]
*  So I think having variable durations of effort reward [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8581.06s)]
*  in one's life and being able to see where, [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8587.06s)]
*  like the latency is very short. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8589.419999999998s)]
*  Yes, social media, but other things [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8591.3s)]
*  that where you have longer duration effort [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8594.06s)]
*  to reward contingencies. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8595.94s)]
*  I'm sounding kind of, this is like nerd speak, [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8597.7s)]
*  but I've gone on record saying before, [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8599.300000000001s)]
*  and I'll say again that, you know, [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8600.94s)]
*  dopamine that is achieved without effort preceding it [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8601.78s)]
*  is just be really careful. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8605.5s)]
*  Doesn't matter if it's amphetamine, cocaine, [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8607.78s)]
*  social media or anything else. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8610.18s)]
*  You get used to the schedule. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8614.34s)]
*  That's right. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8616.58s)]
*  And I think we need to be able to tolerate and enjoy [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8617.42s)]
*  and lean into and savor variable schedules [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8620.380000000001s)]
*  of effort and reward. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8623.94s)]
*  It's so interesting you say that. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8625.58s)]
*  I have two thoughts that number one, [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8626.62s)]
*  when I think about the puzzle situation, [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8627.66s)]
*  that's like effort, because effort, effort, effort, [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8629.74s)]
*  struggle, deep breath, effort, effort, [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8632.98s)]
*  nope, that's not it, effort, effort. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8635.26s)]
*  And then you get the dopamine. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8636.58s)]
*  That circuit, I just always think [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8638.02s)]
*  that is such a benefit to my kid later in life. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8640.22s)]
*  It's kind of the opposite of, you know, [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8644.66s)]
*  which we all do sometimes, but if it's the only circuit [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8646.74s)]
*  being on your iPad all the time as a little kid [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8650.26s)]
*  and the no effort, all the dopamine. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8652.58s)]
*  Well, I think about it as a friend used to call it years [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8655.1s)]
*  ago, birthday money. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8657.460000000001s)]
*  There's one time each year, okay, maybe a couple [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8658.42s)]
*  because of the holidays, when you're supposed to get [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8660.74s)]
*  presents just for being you, it's called your birthday. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8663.300000000001s)]
*  Right? [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8666.94s)]
*  Or if you're a kid, you know, or whatever holidays [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8667.78s)]
*  are where we celebrate kids by giving presents [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8669.82s)]
*  or we celebrate each other. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8671.86s)]
*  But every other day, you're not supposed to get rewards [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8672.7s)]
*  necessarily just because, not just for being you. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8675.42s)]
*  The rewards are out there in life and appreciating things. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8678.06s)]
*  I'm not trying to be too stoic here, [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8680.460000000001s)]
*  but there's only one day each year where you get [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8682.34s)]
*  literally presents just for being you. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8685.94s)]
*  The other stuff is supposed to require effort. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8686.9s)]
*  Yeah, and struggle. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8689.18s)]
*  I think, you know, it's really interesting. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8690.460000000001s)]
*  My second had a lot of speech issues when she was younger [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8692.26s)]
*  and I kind of noticed it, like at a certain age [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8696.62s)]
*  you're supposed to be building sounds and words [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8698.460000000001s)]
*  and she was replacing, like as soon as she had a new sound [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8700.220000000001s)]
*  she lost one and had a sense of what was going on. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8702.94s)]
*  She had a pretty serious speech apraxia. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8705.5s)]
*  She had to go to speech therapy three days a week, right? [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8708.02s)]
*  For probably a year. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8711.42s)]
*  She now, you wouldn't know, but it was interesting. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8712.5s)]
*  I remember that time, my older one, I tried five, [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8715.779999999999s)]
*  maybe she was two or three and six, [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8717.58s)]
*  and I remember someone saying to me like, [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8719.619999999999s)]
*  oh, about my daughter, like, oh, poor her kind of, [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8721.74s)]
*  you know, it's like a lot. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8723.9s)]
*  And I don't think I said this, but it's so interesting. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8725.34s)]
*  I remember thinking, she's way better off than my son. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8728.619999999999s)]
*  If I'm gonna worry about one of my kids right now, [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8732.38s)]
*  which I'm not worried about either, I'd worry about my son. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8734.06s)]
*  His early years were so linear, so without struggle, [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8737.859999999999s)]
*  like she's gonna have an early experience [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8742.58s)]
*  of struggling, working hard. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8745.58s)]
*  She won't remember it with her words, [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8748.3s)]
*  but that circuitry, which are important memories, [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8750.46s)]
*  ones we don't remember with our words, [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8753.18s)]
*  ones that our bodies remember, [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8754.78s)]
*  she has such an early experience [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8756.539999999999s)]
*  with watching herself struggle and get to the other side. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8758.94s)]
*  Like, I would wish that for every child. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8762.26s)]
*  And so I also think, I wanna also share that story [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8765.82s)]
*  because I think parents who have kids [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8768.98s)]
*  who have those early issues, it's so easy. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8770.539999999999s)]
*  I actually think it's really empowering [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8774.34s)]
*  to do a complete 180, to be like, [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8775.660000000002s)]
*  wait, I'm not gonna fix this right away. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8777.1s)]
*  I'm gonna support my child. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8779.300000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna let them know I believe in them. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8780.42s)]
*  I'm gonna let them know I see a version of them [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8782.26s)]
*  that's gonna get through this. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8783.94s)]
*  They're gonna still struggle. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8784.900000000001s)]
*  And that is actually gonna be like the best foundation [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8786.220000000001s)]
*  and almost like the best leg up. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8789.380000000001s)]
*  Now I have a friend very, very successful [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8792.34s)]
*  who told me that he wasn't until he was in his 40s [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8794.86s)]
*  that he had like kind of a major difficult life, [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8798.54s)]
*  a major business disappointment. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8802.58s)]
*  And it almost crushed him. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8804.82s)]
*  But he had never had that before. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8807.62s)]
*  He had been so successful over and over again. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8809.42s)]
*  It was fun for me to talk to my dad recently on the podcast [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8812.38s)]
*  because we haven't had a conversation like that ever. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8815.74s)]
*  And we were talking about sort of mistakes that one makes [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8819.14s)]
*  and in the context of work, et cetera. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8821.62s)]
*  And he said, I'm still ringing in my ears. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8825.22s)]
*  He said, well, those humiliations are actually good for us. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8827.34s)]
*  He called them humiliations. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8830.46s)]
*  I was like, really? [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8833.3s)]
*  He was like, yeah, they humble us [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8834.14s)]
*  and they keep us thoughtful about what we're doing next. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8835.38s)]
*  And I was like, yeah. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8838.46s)]
*  But it was kind of wild to hear that. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8839.419999999998s)]
*  I don't know why I need to hear it externally [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8841.66s)]
*  because I know it's true. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8843.179999999998s)]
*  I knew it was true. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8844.099999999999s)]
*  But yeah, it's not just making mistakes. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8845.46s)]
*  Like sometimes, listen, I'm fully against bullying [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8847.66s)]
*  where I understand how that can be very destructive. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8851.38s)]
*  But like there are gonna be times [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8854.099999999999s)]
*  when we're gonna feel humiliated. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8855.779999999999s)]
*  And to be able to bounce back from that is pretty awesome. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8858.259999999998s)]
*  I actually think that builds character strength. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8863.1s)]
*  I do. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8864.86s)]
*  Yeah, and I think this is like a great lead into parenting. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8865.7s)]
*  I hear this all the time where someone will say, [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8869.26s)]
*  I don't know if my kid's being bullied, [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8871.74s)]
*  but they were told you can't play basketball with us. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8873.02s)]
*  You're the worst basketball player in the grade, [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8876.98s)]
*  something like that. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8878.66s)]
*  Where the way I work with parents is, [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8880.300000000001s)]
*  again, assuming this isn't chronic, [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8883.58s)]
*  I don't think step one is calling the school. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8885.78s)]
*  I don't think step one is calling the other parent. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8887.86s)]
*  Right? [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8890.9s)]
*  If you zoom out, you're right. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8891.74s)]
*  Like I don't think a kid's gonna be called [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8892.82s)]
*  the worst basketball player, you know, [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8894.46s)]
*  over and over in the course of the next couple decades, [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8896.42s)]
*  but they will be called something. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8898.74s)]
*  They'll be left out. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8900.74s)]
*  Or even if nothing happens, you know what's gonna happen? [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8901.939999999999s)]
*  They're gonna feel less than in a group. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8904.3s)]
*  Like probably a million times. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8906.38s)]
*  I do, right, still. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8908.099999999999s)]
*  So we have this almost opportunity of like, [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8910.019999999999s)]
*  okay, well, what skills would be useful [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8912.259999999998s)]
*  when my kid is 18 and 30? [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8914.779999999999s)]
*  And actually the struggle, again, is my opportunity. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8916.9s)]
*  I was thinking, my kids are in my home for 18 years. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8920.42s)]
*  I, it sounds like sick, [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8924.02s)]
*  and I don't know if I really mean this, [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8925.859999999999s)]
*  but I'm gonna say it. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8927.42s)]
*  I almost hope they have all the variations of struggles [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8928.3s)]
*  they're gonna have later on. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8932.699999999999s)]
*  Cause then at least I can kind of get in it with them [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8934.26s)]
*  and like build some skills [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8937.98s)]
*  and help them see that they can manage. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8939.74s)]
*  And then I feel like those bumps are gonna happen. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8942.5s)]
*  Right? [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8944.9s)]
*  But they're pilots, don't they? [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8945.74s)]
*  When they have simulations, [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8947.02s)]
*  there's no way they simulate perfect flights [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8948.5s)]
*  and say you're ready to fly. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8951.02s)]
*  They simulate all the issues [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8952.86s)]
*  so that a pilot can learn the right controls [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8955.42s)]
*  and then they're really prepared. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8959.06s)]
*  They don't take away the issues. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8960.34s)]
*  Right. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8962.58s)]
*  Now I love the analogy of flying [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8963.42s)]
*  cause I, you know, I'll never forget driving [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8965.58s)]
*  in the really thick fog for the first time. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8967.86s)]
*  This happens if you grow up in the Bay area. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8969.34s)]
*  Just being able to see one reflector at a time [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8971.74s)]
*  and being terrified. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8973.58s)]
*  Now, like driving in fog never feels great, [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8974.82s)]
*  but I've been there. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8978.74s)]
*  It's like, it's a familiar feeling. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8979.86s)]
*  And yeah, I've been thinking a lot these days [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8981.9s)]
*  about this whole thing about proficiency [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8984.539999999999s)]
*  and our expectation of kids nowadays, [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8986.699999999999s)]
*  you know, that we have been told for a long time [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8990.98s)]
*  that we need to guard against kids [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8993.58s)]
*  feeling terrible about themselves. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8995.86s)]
*  On the other hand, we want them to be proficient. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8997.539999999999s)]
*  And what you're really talking about here, [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=8999.82s)]
*  if I understand correctly, is proficiency at being human, [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9000.9s)]
*  at being really good at certain things, [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9005.18s)]
*  less good at others. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9006.02s)]
*  I can also tell, you know, any kid, [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9007.34s)]
*  cause I was this kid, like in a group of musicians, [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9009.7s)]
*  I'm the least proficient. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9012.02s)]
*  I mean, you really just talk about wanting someone [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9012.94s)]
*  to do nothing. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9015.26s)]
*  I'm best off not even playing the triangle. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9016.26s)]
*  Okay, like just doing nothing would be the best thing [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9018.42s)]
*  I could do to any musical effort. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9020.46s)]
*  But I realize that at some point, [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9023.82s)]
*  even though every kid in my school played an instrument, [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9025.34s)]
*  they had like the youth symphony and all that kind of stuff, [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9028.54s)]
*  because it was also a time when I could just kind of relax. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9031.54s)]
*  Like you don't have to be certainly best at everything. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9035.22s)]
*  But I also believe that in order to really find [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9038.66s)]
*  what you're kind of quote unquote meant for, [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9040.58s)]
*  you have to try a bunch of things and find out [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9042.74s)]
*  what you're never going to even approach [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9044.699999999999s)]
*  partially skilled at. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9047.82s)]
*  But you still have to try. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9048.66s)]
*  I guess that's the point. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9050.3s)]
*  So on the one hand, I guess I'm saying do nothing. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9051.14s)]
*  On the other hand, I'm saying you still have to try. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9053.259999999998s)]
*  I guess you have to try to find out [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9054.58s)]
*  that you're really as bad at music as I found out I am. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9055.699999999999s)]
*  Maybe, or I think we're also talking. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9058.179999999998s)]
*  I'm good with it. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9060.019999999999s)]
*  I'm good with it. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9060.859999999999s)]
*  I love music, but I don't need to play it. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9061.699999999999s)]
*  But I think then what you're saying [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9062.539999999999s)]
*  is you're able to separate your identity from any behavior. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9063.38s)]
*  Being bad at music doesn't mean you're a bad person. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9068.099999999999s)]
*  And I think anyone hears that and they're like, obviously. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9070.82s)]
*  But we conflate those two things 90% of the time. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9073.019999999999s)]
*  That's why we really care about winning at Scrabble [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9078.38s)]
*  is like to some degree we think it means we're smart [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9081.06s)]
*  and everyone's like, you know, [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9083.22s)]
*  versus I'm probably the same level of smart [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9084.619999999999s)]
*  whether I win at Scrabble or lose at Scrabble. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9087.14s)]
*  And to me, that's what confidence is. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9089.38s)]
*  It's not feeling like you're the best at something. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9091.38s)]
*  It's feeling like it's okay to be you [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9093.98s)]
*  when you're not the best at something, right? [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9096.46s)]
*  It's feeling at home with yourself. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9098.74s)]
*  And to me, feeling at home with yourself is, [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9100.74s)]
*  first of all, it's an amazing internal motivator [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9104.06s)]
*  because you get to also figure out [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9105.9s)]
*  what you're really passionate about, right? [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9106.74s)]
*  And yeah, learning to participate in things [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9109.98s)]
*  and even have joy in things that you're not great at. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9112.939999999999s)]
*  Again, these are things I think our kids really can learn [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9115.699999999999s)]
*  not from lessons, not from a textbook, [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9118.5s)]
*  not really from a teacher. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9121.66s)]
*  They learn it from what we model. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9123.099999999999s)]
*  It's actually interesting. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9124.619999999999s)]
*  We play a ton of board games for my family. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9125.46s)]
*  And I'm just, I think they're like the antidote [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9127.5s)]
*  to everything on a screen. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9129.5s)]
*  So we have a million board games. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9130.82s)]
*  I'm the resident, if anyone ever needs a recommendation [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9132.46s)]
*  for a good board game. What's your favorite [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9134.939999999999s)]
*  board game to play as a family? [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9135.779999999999s)]
*  Okay, I love Sushi Go. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9138.14s)]
*  Okay, I don't know it, but I'll check it out. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9139.82s)]
*  Sushi Go Party is the better version. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9140.66s)]
*  It's actually a really great adult game too. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9142.339999999998s)]
*  It's very strategic. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9143.82s)]
*  We play code names. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9144.939999999999s)]
*  We play a lot of board games. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9146.98s)]
*  We play Boggle, we play Ghost, we play Scrabble, [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9149.06s)]
*  we play Rummy Q, but the game I was gonna say [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9151.82s)]
*  that we also play a lot of that I love is Scattergories. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9155.34s)]
*  Okay, so have you ever played that? [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9158.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's a fun game. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9159.66s)]
*  I, whatever part of the brain is good at generating [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9161.019999999999s)]
*  a lot of different things from a single letter [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9163.9s)]
*  must be very small in my brain. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9165.859999999999s)]
*  I am so bad at Scattergories. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9167.38s)]
*  I mean, my kids are all pretty quick. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9170.099999999999s)]
*  I lose to everyone, my seven-year-old included. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9171.82s)]
*  I'm horrible. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9173.9s)]
*  It actually is a game I suggest often. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9174.74s)]
*  I'm like, let's play Scattergories. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9177.14s)]
*  And I think that's actually so powerful for our kids. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9179.34s)]
*  I mean, I think a lot of us, if we look back, [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9183.939999999999s)]
*  we think like, is one of the reasons my parents [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9186.34s)]
*  didn't really play with me or do things [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9188.099999999999s)]
*  they felt like they weren't good at it, you know? [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9190.14s)]
*  Like probably, right? [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9191.939999999999s)]
*  To demonstrate to your kid, I can choose something. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9193.939999999999s)]
*  I can have joy in something. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9197.06s)]
*  I can want to do something that I'm not good at. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9198.859999999999s)]
*  That is, again, gonna be more powerful to your kid [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9203.06s)]
*  than sitting down and saying, [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9205.38s)]
*  this is what we think is gonna help kids. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9207.22s)]
*  It's okay to do things that you're not good at. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9208.58s)]
*  That's like logical words in the brain. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9211.82s)]
*  That's not an experience they're building or internalizing. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9214.22s)]
*  Kids learn from stories, from experiences. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9217.82s)]
*  And so I think that's one way in terms of [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9220.46s)]
*  how do I help my kids be confident, [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9224.339999999998s)]
*  but also just be at home with themselves [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9226.42s)]
*  and do things they're not best at. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9228.82s)]
*  Probably the best way to do that is to model it [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9230.98s)]
*  over and over to your kids. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9234.18s)]
*  I love it. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9236.06s)]
*  We're back to theory versus practice. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9236.9s)]
*  Yes, I'm big on practice. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9238.82s)]
*  Maybe I'm both. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9240.7s)]
*  I feel like as long as there are kids and adults [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9242.1s)]
*  that seem, I want to emphasize seem, to do everything well, [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9245.1s)]
*  the athlete, academic, musician, good dancer, [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9250.1s)]
*  as long as charming with other people, [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9257.62s)]
*  as long as those people exist or seem to exist, [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9259.7s)]
*  we're going to have to all overcome our sense [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9264.26s)]
*  that we should be at least partially good [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9267.26s)]
*  at a wide variety of things, maybe not everything. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9270.220000000001s)]
*  Do you think those people exist? [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9274.26s)]
*  No, I know they don't exist. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9275.54s)]
*  I know that there are people that apparently are like that. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9276.78s)]
*  They're fakers. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9280.26s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9281.34s)]
*  I will say that, and this is, [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9283.5s)]
*  I don't get paid to say positive things [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9286.300000000001s)]
*  about the university I work for or not, [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9288.86s)]
*  but I will say occasionally I'll meet a student [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9292.42s)]
*  from Stanford and I'm like, goodness gracious. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9296.22s)]
*  Like this kid can apparently do everything. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9300.18s)]
*  Like they're an athlete and they're a musician. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9304.54s)]
*  They have all these things. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9306.38s)]
*  There are those people. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9307.22s)]
*  And I will say, but this is important, [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9309.78s)]
*  the pressure that the perception of those people [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9313.86s)]
*  creates on them without fail brings them [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9318.18s)]
*  to immense challenge in their life, if not then later. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9322.5s)]
*  I've seen it every single time. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9326.5s)]
*  I know because I grew up in the town [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9327.86s)]
*  where I'm now a professor and I went to school [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9329.98s)]
*  with many people who ended up there [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9332.5s)]
*  or other places like that. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9334.42s)]
*  And of course there are people like that [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9336.78s)]
*  in every environment. [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9338.02s)]
*  They are outliers. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9339.380000000001s)]
*  They tend to be very salient. [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9340.460000000001s)]
*  We tend to notice them and they create this false sense [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9342.06s)]
*  of internal pressure. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9347.58s)]
*  This is the reason I raise it. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9348.86s)]
*  And I wanna say it's not like they eventually fail [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9349.94s)]
*  and dissolve into a puddle of their own tears. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9353.22s)]
*  Like hopefully they're resilient [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9354.94s)]
*  and they push forward in life. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9356.74s)]
*  And some of them do amazing things [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9357.86s)]
*  and some of them do less amazing things. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9359.3s)]
*  But the point is that there are people among our species [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9361.380000000001s)]
*  that seem to do many, many things very, very well. [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9364.460000000001s)]
*  And I think when we hold ourselves to that standard, [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9367.26s)]
*  we suffer and we hold ourselves back. [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9372.78s)]
*  I think that I believe, [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9374.82s)]
*  I just have a central belief that we all do have [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9376.18s)]
*  some unique gifts that we're meant to bring to our life [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9378.380000000001s)]
*  and to the world. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9381.1s)]
*  And it shows up in different forms. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9382.34s)]
*  And one of the worst things we can do [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9383.86s)]
*  in trying to find that and express it [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9385.66s)]
*  is trying to be really good at everything. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9387.58s)]
*  I just think that's the most poisonous idea [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9390.86s)]
*  in the American mindset [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9394.34s)]
*  that we're supposed to be really good at everything. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9396.58s)]
*  On the other hand, I personally believe [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9398.14s)]
*  that we should try a variety of things [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9400.14s)]
*  so that we experience frustration and fail [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9402.5s)]
*  and eventually find what it is [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9404.82s)]
*  that is we're quote unquote meant to do. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9406.06s)]
*  I do, but I feel also very fortunate [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9409.18s)]
*  that I was never really pushed [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9411.3s)]
*  to be excellent at everything. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9412.58s)]
*  I have terrible hand-eye coordination, [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9414.18s)]
*  but I'm pretty good at sports with my feet. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9416.14s)]
*  But when I say pretty good, I mean passable. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9417.539999999999s)]
*  So I gave up on the idea of becoming a professional athlete [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9420.18s)]
*  very, very young. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9422.46s)]
*  So I think we have to know that we had to play games [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9423.82s)]
*  with our hands and our feet in order to figure that out. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9425.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and I guess, we were talking about this [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9428.3s)]
*  maybe before we started, [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9432.26s)]
*  but I don't know, I'm trying to think why this is, [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9433.34s)]
*  but I tend not to put anyone on a pedestal. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9435.98s)]
*  I feel like, and maybe part of it is [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9440.3s)]
*  in part of my private practice for years, [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9442.94s)]
*  I saw, maybe I saw the Stanford grads [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9445.22s)]
*  who were then living in New York. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9447.74s)]
*  And they weren't literally from Stanford, [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9449.1s)]
*  but I'd have all these late 20 year olds [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9452.58s)]
*  and their pedigree all look the same, top of their class. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9455.1s)]
*  Ivy League, Goldman Sachs, this MBA. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9459.06s)]
*  And so many of them had the same [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9463.86s)]
*  insane anxiety and emptiness. [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9470.02s)]
*  I still remember the way one of them described [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9472.7s)]
*  how they felt and she was brilliant with her words. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9474.58s)]
*  And she said, I walk around and it's like, [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9477.7s)]
*  when I'm with people and doing things and at work, [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9481.5s)]
*  it's like, there's a ton of color. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9483.98s)]
*  When I'm alone, I feel like I am an empty room [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9485.82s)]
*  with white walls. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9489.98s)]
*  Oh goodness, that's very sad. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9490.9s)]
*  It actually has a happy ending, [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9493.9s)]
*  which is really, or has a nuanced ending, [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9495.82s)]
*  but happy ending where she feeling, [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9498.42s)]
*  I was actually saying this to a friend [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9505.779999999999s)]
*  because it actually relates to my own childhood. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9507.019999999999s)]
*  I feel like I've grown a lot, had my therapy. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9508.38s)]
*  And I feel like when I was younger, [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9512.779999999999s)]
*  I was really hard driving [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9515.3s)]
*  and really like somewhat people pleasing. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9518.18s)]
*  And me and my friend who are both like that, [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9521.980000000001s)]
*  we're like that have kids who aren't really like that. [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9524.980000000001s)]
*  And they're amazing kids and they do so well [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9528.060000000001s)]
*  and they have this internal confidence. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9530.18s)]
*  But sometimes we joke for like, [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9531.42s)]
*  but there's nothing that will drive you [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9533.7s)]
*  like feeling not good enough. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9535.980000000001s)]
*  There's nothing that drives you like feeling [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9537.94s)]
*  like every test score defines yourself. [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9539.66s)]
*  And it's so sick, right? [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9544.300000000001s)]
*  Because we're almost like conflicted with our kids. [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9546.1s)]
*  Like they're all great kids, they're responsible, [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9547.94s)]
*  but they almost have a little bit more inner contentment. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9550.9s)]
*  But I think about that young woman I saw [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9556.22s)]
*  and how at work she felt amazing until, [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9559.14s)]
*  didn't happen until she was 28. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9564.619999999999s)]
*  She didn't get the promotion she thought she was getting. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9567.26s)]
*  And then, I mean. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9570.14s)]
*  She never failed before. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9573.46s)]
*  And it's not only the never failure. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9574.859999999999s)]
*  When your internal sense of self is built outside in, [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9576.9s)]
*  which you actually can do [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9582.22s)]
*  if you have a lot of accomplishments, [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9584.46s)]
*  it works for a while. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9586.74s)]
*  But as soon as that stops working, if you have nothing, [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9589.699999999999s)]
*  you feel like in an empty room with white walls. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9594.66s)]
*  What's really compelling about the therapy [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9598.539999999999s)]
*  over the course of a number of years, [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9601.34s)]
*  is I still remember over COVID, we were then zooming [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9602.54s)]
*  and she'd had her own place. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9606.86s)]
*  And she actually went through this process [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9609.14s)]
*  and she was very artistic of painting the walls [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9611.58s)]
*  in her actual room, talking about making something concrete. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9614.5s)]
*  And like kind of in the way that she was feeling [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9617.86s)]
*  a lot more lit up inside out instead of outside in. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9619.86s)]
*  It's great. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9624.06s)]
*  But I just think, I guess I know myself too. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9625.26s)]
*  And maybe this is part of why I try [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9627.78s)]
*  not to put people on a pedestal. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9629.02s)]
*  Maybe it's as I'm talking, people are like, [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9630.5s)]
*  oh, Becky gets it right with her kids and she's doing this. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9631.9s)]
*  And whatever I can share, that is part of my story. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9634.18s)]
*  I also yell at my kids. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9638.619999999999s)]
*  I also feel like sometimes I'm on my phone too much. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9639.98s)]
*  I feel like my life is at a balance. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9642.14s)]
*  I don't get to see my friends nearly the way I used to. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9644.14s)]
*  They probably often are like, where's Becky? [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9646.22s)]
*  Why is she not, not only responding to texts, [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9648.18s)]
*  but remembering my birthday or whatever I forget. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9650.3s)]
*  And that doesn't feel good to me [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9653.1s)]
*  because I used to do more of that. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9654.26s)]
*  And so no one has it all figured out. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9656.02s)]
*  Like humans, I think that's why are remarkably complicated, [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9659.54s)]
*  remarkably imperfect. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9663.06s)]
*  We all have parts of us that feel really good. [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9664.42s)]
*  And maybe some of us play up those parts more than others. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9667.26s)]
*  And we all have parts of us that feel confusing, [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9670.98s)]
*  maybe have some shame, feel, you know, I don't know, [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9676.22s)]
*  just more complicated. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9681.34s)]
*  And so I at least wanna get that out there about myself. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9683.54s)]
*  Oh, I really appreciate you sharing. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9687.5s)]
*  And I wanna be clear if I was at all unclear [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9689.14s)]
*  that I certainly don't hold up these ultra performers [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9692.74s)]
*  in all domains on a pedestal. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9697.02s)]
*  I think they're in a very precarious place [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9698.38s)]
*  inside and outside. [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9701.14s)]
*  They've essentially given up all their power and agency [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9702.539999999999s)]
*  to one incoming failure. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9704.86s)]
*  And maybe they never experienced it [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9706.98s)]
*  and they get to the end without having known, [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9708.26s)]
*  but what a terrible way to live anyway. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9709.5s)]
*  I've always looked up since I was little [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9711.619999999999s)]
*  to people that really took a unique path. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9713.66s)]
*  I've always found that they, yes, [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9716.82s)]
*  accomplished tremendous things [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9720.1s)]
*  and they have interesting, sometimes painful flaws. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9721.26s)]
*  Like I'm a huge fan of the late neurologist [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9724.98s)]
*  and writer Oliver Sacks, very incredible man, [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9728.1s)]
*  very complicated life. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9730.94s)]
*  Incredible. [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9731.94s)]
*  You know, if you read his books, his autobiography, [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9732.78s)]
*  which I highly recommend everybody do [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9734.74s)]
*  if you're interested in science and just animals [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9737.46s)]
*  and a life uniquely lived, he's a really good example. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9740.98s)]
*  And there are a bunch of other examples [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9744.779999999999s)]
*  that are meaningful to me. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9745.74s)]
*  Certainly not somebody who, you know, [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9747.34s)]
*  he couldn't do an experiment to save his life. [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9748.82s)]
*  He was moved out of multiple universities and places, [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9751.22s)]
*  you know, a very, very complicated character, [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9754.82s)]
*  had a methamphetamine addiction, [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9757.619999999999s)]
*  was a closet homosexual, came out later in life [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9760.1s)]
*  and was then long periods of time on his own. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9762.5s)]
*  Then anyway, had a great relationship later in life. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9765.26s)]
*  Very interesting person became that way [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9769.26s)]
*  and found his passion by realizing how terrible he was [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9774.54s)]
*  at certain things, including certain branches of medicine. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9777.34s)]
*  So I think that trying many things [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9780.94s)]
*  and being really realistic about whether or not [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9783.14s)]
*  something's for us or not, but is the key. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9786.14s)]
*  But then I guess the question becomes, [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9789.1s)]
*  and this must be so hard from the perspective of parenting, [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9791.1s)]
*  but also just in terms of guiding ourselves through life [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9793.1s)]
*  is, you know, how much friction do we experience [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9795.26s)]
*  before we say, you know what? [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9797.86s)]
*  I'm not a musician and I'm cool with that. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9799.66s)]
*  I love music, but I'm gonna put my efforts [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9802.460000000001s)]
*  into these other things. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9805.18s)]
*  And, you know, this thing comes more easily for me. [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9806.060000000001s)]
*  You know, I do think we have a lot of natural tendencies [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9808.220000000001s)]
*  and I feel like, especially in the United States, [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9810.42s)]
*  there's been this complicated relationship [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9812.140000000001s)]
*  with parenting and education, [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9814.220000000001s)]
*  whereby we don't wanna push people to their own, [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9815.62s)]
*  you know, like suffering and demise, [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9819.460000000001s)]
*  but we also have to avoid not pushing them [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9821.42s)]
*  because then they don't ever find [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9823.66s)]
*  what they are proficient in [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9825.54s)]
*  and they don't learn that overcoming friction thing. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9827.06s)]
*  So it's tricky. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9830.34s)]
*  I do believe everyone has a unique expression [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9832.1s)]
*  of themselves in life, whatever that is. [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9834.26s)]
*  It doesn't have to be in professional life, [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9836.1s)]
*  but to try a lot of different things. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9837.42s)]
*  And, you know, how, at what point you bail out. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9839.66s)]
*  I mean, I've had few in my lab, [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9843.38s)]
*  but I've spoken to graduate students in postdocs [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9845.46s)]
*  where I had to say, you know what? [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9847.14s)]
*  I actually had this conversation with a postdoc. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9848.98s)]
*  I was like, you know what? [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9850.46s)]
*  You're a really good scientist. [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9851.3s)]
*  You're never gonna be a professor. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9852.58s)]
*  Let's get you a job in biotech. [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9854.22s)]
*  And they were like, oh, they thought their whole life [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9856.18s)]
*  they were gonna be a professor. [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9858.18s)]
*  I'm like, you're not. [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9859.06s)]
*  And the data are the following, which point to that. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9860.42s)]
*  And it's kind of devastating, [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9863.38s)]
*  but then years later they thanked me [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9864.46s)]
*  or they thanked me in that case. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9866.539999999999s)]
*  A few others probably cursed me, but. [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9868.34s)]
*  So how do you know when to keep pushing your kid [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9870.74s)]
*  to even engage in something? [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9875.14s)]
*  Like maybe they're the kid that always [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9878.18s)]
*  is picked last for the team, [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9881.619999999999s)]
*  but you know they should play sports. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9882.74s)]
*  So I guess my first reaction is I'm reacting [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9884.7s)]
*  to the word pushing, [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9887.900000000001s)]
*  because I'm not sure that's the verb I would think about, [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9888.78s)]
*  because I think the idea of pushing your kid, [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9894.460000000001s)]
*  even like how much do I push, [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9896.18s)]
*  there's a lot about us there. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9898.300000000001s)]
*  Is that my desire? [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9901.060000000001s)]
*  I guess I grew up in a town where a lot of kids got pushed. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9901.900000000001s)]
*  Oh, I mean, I grew up in a town where every kid got pushed. [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9903.7s)]
*  So maybe that's why I know something about it, right? [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9906.220000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think we see this all the time. [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9908.900000000001s)]
*  And it goes back to actually what side of the tennis court, [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9910.18s)]
*  like whose feelings are whose. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9912.5s)]
*  Is this my unlived dreams as an athlete in my youth, [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9914.779999999999s)]
*  or is this actually about my kid's soccer skills? [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9919.66s)]
*  I think parents watching their kids playing sports [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9922.42s)]
*  is a prime example of am I living out my unfulfilled dreams [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9925.619999999999s)]
*  and projecting that onto my daughter? [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9931.539999999999s)]
*  Or does my daughter like soccer? [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9934.5s)]
*  And like, how can I really differentiate those, right? [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9936.619999999999s)]
*  I think actually though, making it back to that, [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9940.18s)]
*  a lot of this actually goes back to frustration tolerance [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9942.460000000001s)]
*  and why it matters so much to me. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9945.38s)]
*  Like my approach to teaching frustration tolerance, [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9948.42s)]
*  which is like a hidden gem we have here at Couldnside, [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9951.7s)]
*  I really want to be in every school. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9955.06s)]
*  I think it needs to be in every school. [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9958.26s)]
*  And I wanna describe it to you, okay? [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9959.58s)]
*  So I literally have this graph, it's helpful. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9962.38s)]
*  And I know you like to write things down too, [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9964.3s)]
*  to make it concrete. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9965.42s)]
*  We're like, point one is not knowing how to do something. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9966.34s)]
*  Okay? [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9970.66s)]
*  And point two, which is very far away, [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9971.5s)]
*  is let's say knowing how to do it or being very proficient. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9973.9s)]
*  This could be soccer. [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9977.1s)]
*  I think a good example is reading, okay? [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9978.86s)]
*  Like everybody starts out not knowing how to read. [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9981.46s)]
*  And let's say not everybody, [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9984.86s)]
*  but a lot of people learn how to read. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9986.38s)]
*  The space between not knowing and knowing, [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9991.1s)]
*  I call the learning space. [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9994.22s)]
*  It has a name and it's helpful to know [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9996.78s)]
*  where you are in a map. [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9998.34s)]
*  And the learning space has one feeling [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=9999.42s)]
*  that you're supposed to have, frustration. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10003.3s)]
*  That is the feeling you're supposed to have. [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10007.18s)]
*  And we have this idea that we share from not knowing [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10010.3s)]
*  to knowing like this. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10014.3s)]
*  It's because of those damn Star Wars movies. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10017.3s)]
*  And oh, no, actually Star Wars incorporated some frustration, [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10019.7s)]
*  but it's because of movies. [[02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10022.14s)]
*  Boom, you're supposed to just have the skill [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10023.94s)]
*  because you picked up the rock or the sword [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10025.78s)]
*  or the pen or the wand. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10027.58s)]
*  And now it's because if you think about the circuitry [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10029.62s)]
*  that kids get used to with dopamine [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10032.5s)]
*  and the space between wanting and having in general is, [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10034.9s)]
*  well, because when you don't know something, [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10040.22s)]
*  you want to know it. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10042.14s)]
*  Here, you do know it. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10043.42s)]
*  Our tolerance and our kids' tolerance for wanting [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10046.22s)]
*  and not having is so low that what's so sad [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10049.86s)]
*  is the learning space has gotten massively compressed [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10054.26s)]
*  and people fear frustration. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10058.3s)]
*  This image, when I've gone over this with kids [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10059.539999999999s)]
*  and even teachers, I know teachers who teach us [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10061.5s)]
*  in their class, okay, today we're gonna learn [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10063.099999999999s)]
*  this new thing. [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10065.06s)]
*  We're gonna learn whatever it is, [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10065.9s)]
*  how to read a short word. [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10068.14s)]
*  Everybody in this class is here, not knowing. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10069.9s)]
*  Everybody in this class is going to get here. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10073.619999999999s)]
*  And probably today, most of us, [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10076.82s)]
*  and you can actually do it now, are gonna be right here. [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10079.779999999999s)]
*  What does this say? [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10081.82s)]
*  The learning space. [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10082.9s)]
*  How are we supposed to feel [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10083.939999999999s)]
*  when we're in the learning space? [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10086.26s)]
*  The class can say, frustrated. [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10087.54s)]
*  Okay, here's an interesting assignment, [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10089.82s)]
*  different than you think. [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10092.14s)]
*  The goal today is not to tell me if you can read [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10093.18s)]
*  the letters that are in front of you. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10096.18s)]
*  I want you to raise your hand when you feel frustrated, [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10098.380000000001s)]
*  which feels like this. [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10101.82s)]
*  Oh, I can't do it, because I'm gonna come up to you [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10102.66s)]
*  and I'm gonna give you a high five [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10105.22s)]
*  and I'm gonna say, you are in the learning space. [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10106.460000000001s)]
*  You are learning. [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10108.54s)]
*  How amazing is that? [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10109.460000000001s)]
*  Andrea, I really believe this has the power [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10110.9s)]
*  to change learning, because then when we talk [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10112.66s)]
*  about proficiency or when we talk about years from now, [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10115.78s)]
*  my kid is saying, this happens all the time. [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10119.380000000001s)]
*  I get questions about this all the time. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10120.86s)]
*  My kid says they wanna do whatever. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10122.66s)]
*  It could be a coding class, it could be a lacrosse class. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10124.94s)]
*  And they do it once and then they always come home [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10128.62s)]
*  and they say, I wanna do it, I quit. [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10130.7s)]
*  Or maybe they're on a swim team and they wanna quit. [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10132.78s)]
*  Do I let my kid quit? [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10135.34s)]
*  To me, the question is actually, [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10138.220000000001s)]
*  most likely none of our kids are gonna be Olympic swimmers [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10141.980000000001s)]
*  or like professional basketball players. [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10145.18s)]
*  I think about this a lot with youth sports. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10146.66s)]
*  The whole goal in my mind for most people with youth sports, [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10148.300000000001s)]
*  not everyone, but most, is learning [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10151.14s)]
*  how to deal with frustration, learning how to do things [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10153.98s)]
*  you thought you couldn't do, character, [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10156.34s)]
*  sharing, being a good teammate, sportsmanship, right? [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10159.220000000001s)]
*  All those things are hard skills to learn. [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10162.460000000001s)]
*  So the reason I'm signing my kid up for basketball [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10163.9s)]
*  is actually just because it's like a good medium [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10165.98s)]
*  for all those things. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10167.7s)]
*  And so I wanna be sure that if my kid is quitting, [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10169.26s)]
*  it's not because they're escaping [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10173.7s)]
*  the very, very natural learning space [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10175.460000000001s)]
*  that is so important to be in in life. [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10178.18s)]
*  And this happened, actually my oldest wanted [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10182.18s)]
*  to quit baseball, he'd played for years. [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10184.060000000001s)]
*  And he wanted to quit and the conversation [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10186.7s)]
*  we ended up having was, look, [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10189.740000000002s)]
*  let's wait till the end of the season. [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10192.26s)]
*  Like, and this goes back to values. [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10194.380000000001s)]
*  It's not we don't quit, but like in our family, [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10196.140000000001s)]
*  we really value and try as much as we can [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10200.1s)]
*  to keep our commitments and not just to ourselves, [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10202.06s)]
*  to each other. [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10205.699999999999s)]
*  And so the rest of the season, [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10206.74s)]
*  you might be thinking all the time, [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10208.5s)]
*  I don't wanna be doing this. [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10209.939999999999s)]
*  And again, in my head, I'm thinking, good, [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10211.18s)]
*  that's like a good life experience [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10213.34s)]
*  to watch yourself go through that, [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10214.66s)]
*  as long as it's not toxic. [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10215.74s)]
*  And at the end, we'll talk about it. [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10216.939999999999s)]
*  Interestingly enough, he had the best baseball season [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10219.22s)]
*  he'd ever had. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10221.66s)]
*  He had a grand slam, which no shade to baseball. [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10222.539999999999s)]
*  That's as exciting as youth baseball ever gets, right? [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10225.3s)]
*  And still he was like, they come done. [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10228.46s)]
*  And I felt really good about that. [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10232.78s)]
*  I was like, look, you ended on like, [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10234.74s)]
*  you're playing really well. [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10237.02s)]
*  It wasn't just cause you got moved down in the batting order. [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10238.380000000001s)]
*  Like if that's the reason why I could get moved down [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10241.380000000001s)]
*  to the batting order, they're not starting on basketball. [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10243.82s)]
*  I hear this all the time, now they wanna quit. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10246.1s)]
*  I don't have any rigid rules, [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10248.380000000001s)]
*  but if that becomes a pattern, that worries me, [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10250.060000000001s)]
*  or not worries me, but forget youth sports. [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10254.66s)]
*  That's just not a great circuitry that would be conducive [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10258.46s)]
*  with kind of resilience and confidence in adulthood. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10262.619999999999s)]
*  I love, love, love this concept, [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10266.38s)]
*  which I believe to be entirely true, [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10270.82s)]
*  that the learning space between unskilled and skilled, [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10273.06s)]
*  if you will, is characterized by the feeling of frustration [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10276.619999999999s)]
*  in mind and body. [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10280.9s)]
*  I don't wanna rattle off another experiment, [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10282.779999999999s)]
*  but there is just, oh, so much data. [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10284.619999999999s)]
*  I'll share this with you offline, the papers that is, [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10287.1s)]
*  showing that brain plasticity changes in neural circuitry [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10290.460000000001s)]
*  only occur when the chemical milieu of the brain [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10294.1s)]
*  is different than it normally is. [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10297.06s)]
*  Otherwise, how would the brain know it should change? [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10298.54s)]
*  So what sets the context for massive change [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10301.26s)]
*  in our neural circuitry is when there's a lot of adrenaline [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10304.98s)]
*  in the body, sorry folks, it's true, [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10308.1s)]
*  adrenaline also called epinephrine, [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10310.26s)]
*  and norepinephrine released in the brain. [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10311.86s)]
*  Now you don't wanna be in a state of panic or stress [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10314.02s)]
*  to the point where you're debilitated, [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10316.62s)]
*  but that shift in the chemical milieu sets the stage [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10318.86s)]
*  for rewiring of connections between neurons. [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10323.34s)]
*  I mean, this is known at the molecular level, [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10327.220000000001s)]
*  it's known at the cellular level, [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10328.94s)]
*  it's known at the circuit level, [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10330.1s)]
*  and I'm excited to share that literature with you [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10331.140000000001s)]
*  because it just basically is a bunch of nerd speak [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10333.060000000001s)]
*  and numbers to support the fact that you're nailing it [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10337.220000000001s)]
*  right in the bull's eye, which is without frustration, [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10341.26s)]
*  there is no rewiring of the neural circuits. [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10344.02s)]
*  And if you think about it, it had to be that way. [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10347.26s)]
*  Otherwise, why would the circuits change? [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10348.38s)]
*  So that the error signal is what sets plasticity in motion. [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10350.74s)]
*  Now the actual rewiring occurs during sleep, [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10355.18s)]
*  so this is my reminder to make sure [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10357.18s)]
*  that your kids get enough sleep, [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10358.460000000001s)]
*  because that's when the actual, [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10359.42s)]
*  this is the phenomenon of not being able to do something [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10360.42s)]
*  coming back a few days or weeks later, [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10362.34s)]
*  and you're like, can do it, [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10363.86s)]
*  well, it's because it happened in sleep, [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10364.82s)]
*  the final portion of the rewiring. [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10366.22s)]
*  That's why phones shouldn't be in the bedroom for kids. [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10368.02s)]
*  I think 75% of people between the age of seven and 18 [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10370.38s)]
*  are massively sleep deprived. [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10375.539999999999s)]
*  And the neural rewiring deficits associated with that [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10378.539999999999s)]
*  are serious, and these are what we call sensitive periods. [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10382.58s)]
*  I like sensitive periods more than critical periods, [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10386.179999999998s)]
*  because critical periods imply an open and shut. [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10388.14s)]
*  Sensitive, there's a tapering, but it does taper. [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10390.22s)]
*  So this unskilled to skilled [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10393.779999999999s)]
*  and frustration in the learning space model, [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10397.66s)]
*  this is part of something that you're putting together now. [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10400.22s)]
*  Could you expand on that? I already have it. [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10402.06s)]
*  Our frustration tolerance program, it's a workshop, [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10403.78s)]
*  it's within our membership. [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10406.3s)]
*  So it's one of 30 workshops. [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10409.82s)]
*  To me, it's one where, the thing is no parents say, [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10412.7s)]
*  Dr. Becky, what I'm really dealing with [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10416.38s)]
*  is low frustration tolerance. [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10417.62s)]
*  They'll say, my kid is having tantrums, [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10419.14s)]
*  or they won't do their homework, [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10421.54s)]
*  or kids with ADHD tend to have [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10423.06s)]
*  low frustration tolerance. [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10425.62s)]
*  So to me, it's like one of the first things I recommend [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10427.1s)]
*  to new members where I say, okay, you might, [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10431.02s)]
*  this is the thing, this is like the key thing [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10434.14s)]
*  that underlies a lot of tantrums, [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10435.9s)]
*  that underlies entitlement, it underlies not sharing, [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10438.179999999998s)]
*  it underlies why you throw the board game [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10442.42s)]
*  when you're about to lose, it underlies quitting, [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10443.98s)]
*  it's not homework. [[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10446.3s)]
*  And again, the MGI, the most generous interpretation is, [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10447.22s)]
*  wait, right, the commonality in all those situations [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10450.38s)]
*  is my kid is frustrated. [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10454.259999999998s)]
*  And if what they're learning or what they've practiced [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10456.46s)]
*  is when I feel frustrated, it's so intense. [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10459.66s)]
*  That sometimes I think like, do our kids learn [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10463.66s)]
*  that their emotions operate on a dimmer switch [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10465.619999999999s)]
*  or an on off switch? [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10468.74s)]
*  We want our kids to operate on a dimmer. [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10470.34s)]
*  Like you said, if you're at a 10 out of 10, [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10472.539999999999s)]
*  you can't operate. [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10475.06s)]
*  But if every time, and I'm so interested [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10476.5s)]
*  in this literature you mentioned, [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10478.38s)]
*  because I was thinking, what would happen [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10479.46s)]
*  in the first number of years of a kid's life [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10481.539999999999s)]
*  if every time they're frustrated, well intentioned, [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10483.1s)]
*  but again, just under resourced parents, turn it off. [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10486.62s)]
*  Then what I think would happen, and I'm wondering, [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10490.5s)]
*  is then something that could be like a five out of 10, [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10492.740000000002s)]
*  I feel like would feel like a 10 out of 10, [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10497.18s)]
*  because you never had a dimmer, right? [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10499.900000000001s)]
*  Because if you only operated when a light went on [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10502.78s)]
*  with always going off, then even if over time years later, [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10505.1s)]
*  the light was at a five, it's still gonna feel blinding. [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10508.62s)]
*  Right, and so this idea of a dimmer, [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10513.060000000001s)]
*  you want your kids when they're frustrated, [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10515.42s)]
*  that's what frustration tolerance is. [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10517.54s)]
*  Nobody says I'm frustrated, I can't read, yay! [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10520.26s)]
*  No one says that. [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10523.18s)]
*  But if it kind of comes up, oh, there's that light. [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10524.58s)]
*  We want their bodies to think, okay, all I need to do, [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10527.94s)]
*  and I have skills to get my nine out of 10 to an eight, [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10531.26s)]
*  an eight to a seven, when I'm at a seven, [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10534.7s)]
*  that's where learning happens. [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10538.3s)]
*  That's very different than it's at a nine, [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10540.1s)]
*  and kind of like, who's gonna turn it off for me? [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10543.380000000001s)]
*  Or the reason in those situations, [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10546.5s)]
*  kids say, I'm not doing my homework, [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10548.3s)]
*  is they don't have the skills to bring it to a seven. [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10550.06s)]
*  And so their choice is to stay at a nine or 10 out of 10, [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10552.5s)]
*  which no human can do, or walk away and bring it to a zero. [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10554.82s)]
*  And so what I'm saying is our frustration tolerance [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10558.34s)]
*  workshop, which I want every parent to take, [[02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10560.18s)]
*  but I also just wanna get into schools, [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10562.18s)]
*  is literally the thing that helps you teach your kids [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10565.3s)]
*  how to get frustration tolerance, how to, [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10569.1s)]
*  you really can do this, it sounds sick, [[02:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10572.34s)]
*  but like, you can get your kids to like being [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10573.98s)]
*  in the learning space, to be like, I'm gonna thrive here, [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10576.94s)]
*  the good feeling is eventually gonna come, [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10581.06s)]
*  I'm relatively comfortable here, [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10583.460000000001s)]
*  because I just have watched myself survive [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10585.78s)]
*  at that many times, and so the benefits of that workshop, [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10588.18s)]
*  and just the program, is not only tantrums, [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10592.460000000001s)]
*  but actually is a lot in academics, [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10595.78s)]
*  because that, so many times when kids have issues in school, [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10598.26s)]
*  ADHD is real, dyslexia is real, [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10602.98s)]
*  that definitely can be a component, [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10605.14s)]
*  but so many times, it's actually an issue [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10607.06s)]
*  of frustration tolerance, and that's often not [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10610.300000000001s)]
*  kind of labeled for parents. [[02:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10614.460000000001s)]
*  I'm realizing as you're saying this, [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10617.300000000001s)]
*  that the literature that I'm aware of about stress [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10620.300000000001s)]
*  and trauma is actually relevant here, [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10622.9s)]
*  in an interesting and perhaps surprising way, [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10625.34s)]
*  whereby, this thing I said earlier, [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10627.460000000001s)]
*  the brain only changes under conditions [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10629.9s)]
*  where norepinephrine and epinephrine are released, [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10631.46s)]
*  there is such a thing as one trial learning, [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10635.38s)]
*  and it's associated with negative experiences, [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10637.3s)]
*  and the reason negative experiences [[02:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10640.099999999999s)]
*  create such robust learning in only one trial, [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10641.98s)]
*  is because there's a massive amount of epinephrine [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10644.699999999999s)]
*  and norepinephrine and other neurochemicals released, [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10646.939999999999s)]
*  so it's stamped into the nervous system, [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10648.98s)]
*  but learning of things we want to learn, [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10651.259999999998s)]
*  relies on the same neurochemicals. [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10654.5s)]
*  I mean, there's a wild and really cool literature [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10656.74s)]
*  from a guy named James McGaw, [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10659.58s)]
*  who showed that like if you spike adrenaline before learning, [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10661.98s)]
*  the learning is much faster and much more durable. [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10664.539999999999s)]
*  If you spike adrenaline after learning, [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10666.78s)]
*  it turns out the learning is more durable. [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10669.14s)]
*  Now, we can't start getting into kind of biohacking [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10672.38s)]
*  experiments on kids or themselves, [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10675.42s)]
*  but the adrenaline is supposed to come [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10677.3s)]
*  during the learning itself, which is what you're saying, [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10680.38s)]
*  but the problem is, if we stop once we're frustrated, [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10682.58s)]
*  we get the increase in adrenaline and norepinephrine, [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10688.06s)]
*  and again, other neurochemicals as well, [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10690.98s)]
*  but then the perception is that the plasticity loop [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10693.34s)]
*  is closed there, so what did you learn? [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10697.02s)]
*  When I do hard things, I get frustrated. [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10698.46s)]
*  When I stop, the frustration goes away. [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10700.06s)]
*  That's all you learn. [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10703.34s)]
*  In the same way that somebody exposed to trauma, [[02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10704.18s)]
*  this underlies the basis of almost all [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10705.94s)]
*  modern trauma therapies, is that in the right setting, [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10707.86s)]
*  take people back through it sequentially, [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10710.7s)]
*  let them experience that and start to desensitize to it [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10714.34s)]
*  so they can complete that loop. [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10717.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10719.3s)]
*  And so I think it's so important [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10720.3s)]
*  to push through frustration, and I think it's so important [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10722.58s)]
*  as you're, I'm just agreeing with you here clearly, [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10725.62s)]
*  but that oftentimes that frustration can last [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10728.94s)]
*  more than just the learning session. [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10732.5s)]
*  It can be weeks or months or in some cases, [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10733.98s)]
*  a year of a really challenging course [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10736.94s)]
*  or a sports participation, and so that's where it gets tough [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10739.18s)]
*  because as empathic creatures, one hopes, [[02:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10743.1s)]
*  we hate to see members of our own species suffer, [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10745.66s)]
*  especially our kids, and so it becomes this thing of like, [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10749.1s)]
*  do you let them opt out? [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10752.62s)]
*  Like, what did they learn by opting out? [[02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10754.460000000001s)]
*  And that's where it gets really complicated [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10756.02s)]
*  because we also got a forebrain [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10757.86s)]
*  which can set all these different rules. [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10759.02s)]
*  And so- [[02:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10760.54s)]
*  But can I, I don't know about frustration for a year. [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10762.34s)]
*  I guess I always think how we experience a feeling [[02:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10764.7s)]
*  is the feeling plus the story we tell ourselves [[02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10768.54s)]
*  about the feeling. [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10771.380000000001s)]
*  And the feeling kind of is at a certain level, [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10773.34s)]
*  but the story we tell ourselves about the feeling [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10777.26s)]
*  and what it means about us [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10779.78s)]
*  or how capable we are of coping with it, [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10781.62s)]
*  that can make a feeling that was here go to here. [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10784.300000000001s)]
*  Something about frustration of a year, like, [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10787.66s)]
*  it's interesting, we're talking so much about stories, [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10790.62s)]
*  but again, if one of the things I try as a parent [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10792.94s)]
*  is when my kid is saying, [[02:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10796.66s)]
*  I don't know, what would it be to quit? [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10798.9s)]
*  I hate gymnastics, right? [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10801.02s)]
*  And you're thinking, okay, like, first of all, [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10806.02s)]
*  quitting is not always weak or wrong. [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10808.62s)]
*  Sometimes quitting is a very brave, awesome, [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10810.380000000001s)]
*  great thing to do. [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10812.14s)]
*  Definitely sometimes the absolute best thing to do. [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10812.98s)]
*  100%. [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10815.5s)]
*  But as a parent sometimes, and I get this a lot, [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10816.62s)]
*  like I'm conflicted, like, I don't know what's right. [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10818.26s)]
*  First of all, there's probably not a right. [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10820.3s)]
*  And again, our parenting never hangs on one decision. [[03:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10822.26s)]
*  So just let that go. [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10825.14s)]
*  But I think what I would be curious [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10827.619999999999s)]
*  to just experiment with, again, [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10829.9s)]
*  maybe it's because I'm so obsessed [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10831.539999999999s)]
*  with frustration tolerance, especially in this world, [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10833.26s)]
*  that is so working against frustration tolerance. [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10836.66s)]
*  I feel like it's like even more my duty as a parent to help. [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10839.539999999999s)]
*  So I'm like, okay, let's just have an experiment. [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10842.42s)]
*  Where I would say, okay, talk to me about [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10844.58s)]
*  why you want to quit gymnastics. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10846.66s)]
*  And I might know in the back of my head, [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10847.86s)]
*  maybe they're not as good as everyone anymore, right? [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10850.02s)]
*  Or maybe they just don't like it, who knows? [[03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10852.619999999999s)]
*  But I might say, you know, look, maybe this isn't relevant. [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10855.060000000001s)]
*  I'm thinking about when I did, [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10859.42s)]
*  you know, I'm thinking about a different sport, [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10862.140000000001s)]
*  when I did track growing up. [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10864.9s)]
*  And there were like whole years where I was like, [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10866.94s)]
*  I love track, I love track. [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10868.94s)]
*  And I don't know if I ever told you this, [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10871.220000000001s)]
*  but when I was 11, I hated track. [[03:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10872.58s)]
*  I went from love to hate it. [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10875.86s)]
*  And part of it was, and again, [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10878.66s)]
*  say something kind of relevant to your kid. [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10881.66s)]
*  Part of it was, there was a new kid at school [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10882.98s)]
*  and like I was kind of the track star until she came in. [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10885.1s)]
*  And then I was like second and that just kind of stunk [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10887.66s)]
*  and no, I didn't tell myself it's okay. [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10890.3s)]
*  I kind of told myself this stinks every day. [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10892.539999999999s)]
*  And part of it was all my friends were doing soccer [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10894.5s)]
*  and I kind of felt left out. [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10897.26s)]
*  But I finished the year [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10900.06s)]
*  and the next year something interesting happened. [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10901.3s)]
*  And this is what a kid will say. [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10903.46s)]
*  I'll go, oh what, you love track again? [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10904.66s)]
*  You know, and it's this amazing moment [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10907.46s)]
*  because they're always going to say that to be like, [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10909.66s)]
*  no, no. [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10912.5s)]
*  I ended up deciding that next year is my last year at track [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10915.3s)]
*  and I stopped after that, but can't explain it. [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10917.9s)]
*  It just, it felt like it came from like a different place. [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10920.82s)]
*  And almost like I felt more settled I think after, [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10924.26s)]
*  like I really knew. [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10926.26s)]
*  And I don't know if that's relevant to gymnastics. [[03:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10928.3s)]
*  I do know you've loved it for a while. [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10931.06s)]
*  It's kind of new to not like it. [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10932.54s)]
*  And sometimes when something's new and you don't like it, [[03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10934.94s)]
*  you just gotta go. [[03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10937.42s)]
*  But other times when something's new and you don't like it, [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10938.94s)]
*  you wanna like figure it out. [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10941.26s)]
*  And I don't know, I'm wondering if we should give it [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10943.3s)]
*  a few more weeks to try the figuring it out thing. [[03:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10946.14s)]
*  And again, maybe your kid says, no, I wanna quit. [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10949.82s)]
*  And you're like, fine. [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10952.26s)]
*  And in some ways you've already had the experience [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10953.74s)]
*  no matter what they do. [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10955.619999999999s)]
*  But I think that's what I think about playing around with [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10957.5s)]
*  with kids way more than I think what parents say is, [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10961.14s)]
*  should they quit or not? [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10965.06s)]
*  It's so binary, it's so rigid. [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10966.26s)]
*  And I think we're missing the nuance of the story [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10969.54s)]
*  and the process that matters more [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10972.140000000001s)]
*  than the eventual decision. [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10974.060000000001s)]
*  I love your use of story in narrative with your kids. [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10977.380000000001s)]
*  It seems like you use that a lot. [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10983.380000000001s)]
*  I do. [[03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10984.900000000001s)]
*  Instead of saying, and forgive me for, [[03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10985.740000000002s)]
*  I'm not an analyst, but I feel like it starts [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10988.78s)]
*  with an observation, like, okay, you're behaving this way. [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10991.140000000001s)]
*  Maybe what's behind the behavior or you're expressing this. [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10994.140000000001s)]
*  What's maybe deeper than that. [[03:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10996.380000000001s)]
*  But when talking about your own experiences [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=10997.66s)]
*  towards your kids, as you've been doing here [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11001.06s)]
*  in these pseudo hypotheticals, I'm sure some of them is, [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11002.9s)]
*  this will interview your kids later and find out. [[03:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11005.26s)]
*  No, I'm kidding. [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11007.02s)]
*  It's clear that you use story as a way to kind of share [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11010.38s)]
*  genuinely, but also probe for what might be going on [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11014.38s)]
*  with them. [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11017.58s)]
*  And I have to say, I find it really delightful [[03:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11018.42s)]
*  because it raises lots of questions [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11022.58s)]
*  that I think anyone would have. [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11028.34s)]
*  And I think it's part of your gift, clearly, [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11029.98s)]
*  because so many people follow your advice. [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11033.7s)]
*  But the advice you give is also, it's interesting. [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11038.86s)]
*  It's like an observation, like frustration is key. [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11041.1s)]
*  I want to increase frustration tolerance. [[03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11043.42s)]
*  But then you're not like, okay, you're gonna hammer [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11045.58s)]
*  down their throats frustration tolerance [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11049.06s)]
*  in the following way. [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11050.7s)]
*  It sort of becomes a question, [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11051.54s)]
*  like where's their frustration in your life? [[03:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11052.9s)]
*  And then you put it into your own narrative [[03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11054.94s)]
*  as opposed to necessarily asking them questions. [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11057.74s)]
*  I think asking kids questions or asking people questions [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11060.74s)]
*  generally is great. [[03:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11062.86s)]
*  Like, hey, how can I do better, as you pointed out earlier? [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11063.74s)]
*  But it's really, I don't know if the word is disarming, [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11067.220000000001s)]
*  but it's really entirely positive way, [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11069.7s)]
*  the way you use your own narrative to allow people [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11074.54s)]
*  to start going, oh yeah, like, [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11077.62s)]
*  where am I experiencing frustration? [[03:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11078.86s)]
*  Where can I tolerate that better? [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11080.1s)]
*  And so I think that there's this incredible triad [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11081.820000000002s)]
*  or tripartite thing of like observe, consider, [[03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11085.62s)]
*  like the deeper layer, and then offering a narrative [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11092.300000000001s)]
*  that's really a bunch of questions [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11094.820000000002s)]
*  where you're speaking from your real truth. [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11098.02s)]
*  It's really elegant, I have to say. [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11100.380000000001s)]
*  It's spectacular. [[03:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11102.220000000001s)]
*  I hadn't realized it until right now. [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11103.460000000001s)]
*  I don't know if I realized those parts, [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11104.94s)]
*  but you know what is interesting is it brings up the word [[03:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11106.42s)]
*  we kind of mentioned before, but didn't talk about. [[03:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11109.66s)]
*  And maybe it'll be surprising that I say this. [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11111.86s)]
*  Is shame, and I think shame is the biggest blocker [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11114.140000000001s)]
*  to learning, and shame, I think, can be defined [[03:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11118.9s)]
*  like a lot of things in many ways, [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11122.06s)]
*  but it's the experience of aloneness. [[03:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11124.18s)]
*  I think shame is the feeling you have [[03:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11126.34s)]
*  when you kind of feel like a part of you is not attachable. [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11128.34s)]
*  So for a kid, that's an existential threat [[03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11131.1s)]
*  to not be in attachment with someone. [[03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11133.82s)]
*  And in that way, when you're not attachable, [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11136.42s)]
*  you're alone, you're alone. [[03:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11137.86s)]
*  And so, so many of the things that happen with our kids, [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11140.74s)]
*  because I'll model another story, [[03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11142.86s)]
*  and maybe I'll get some flack for this [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11144.58s)]
*  because it's probably counterintuitive. [[03:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11147.22s)]
*  But I think about like one of my kids, [[03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11149.86s)]
*  my resilient rebel, who was in a hitting stage [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11152.5s)]
*  when he was younger. [[03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11155.14s)]
*  Hitting, and he was just also in like a couple weeks, [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11156.42s)]
*  he was hitting, and then there was this one time [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11159.699999999999s)]
*  where we were doing a family puzzle, and he was younger. [[03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11164.5s)]
*  He was probably like three. [[03:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11167.06s)]
*  It was really hard. [[03:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11168.5s)]
*  It was more for my older kids. [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11169.58s)]
*  He was kind of doing his own thing. [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11171.26s)]
*  He was putting the blocks on the side. [[03:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11172.94s)]
*  We leave, we come back, and like a couple of the puzzle [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11173.82s)]
*  pieces were missing that were in. [[03:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11176.74s)]
*  And I just knew, I knew it. [[03:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11179.7s)]
*  He saw it. [[03:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11181.66s)]
*  I know most generous interpretation, he felt like, [[03:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11182.98s)]
*  oh my God, I can't participate in what the rest [[03:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11186.74s)]
*  of the family is doing. [[03:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11188.42s)]
*  And so you know what I'm gonna do? [[03:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11189.9s)]
*  Because I'm a smart kid, I'm just gonna stop them [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11190.98s)]
*  from participating. [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11193.06s)]
*  And so I'm gonna take the puzzle pieces and hide them. [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11194.26s)]
*  I knew it, I know. [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11197.62s)]
*  So he'd come back, and we'd worked really hard [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11199.14s)]
*  on this puzzle. [[03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11200.7s)]
*  Of course you're angry, but again, I can either do nothing [[03:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11202.699999999999s)]
*  on the outside or do nothing on the inside. [[03:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11204.9s)]
*  In that moment, not always, but chose to be an adult. [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11207.1s)]
*  And I was just like, I know you took the puzzle pieces. [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11210.46s)]
*  I just want, you know, and he's like, what are you talking, [[03:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11212.58s)]
*  no I didn't, you know, maybe he's four, no I didn't. [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11214.18s)]
*  And I was like, we're working on this puzzle. [[03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11216.019999999999s)]
*  I get that it's probably frustrating, but like you need, [[03:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11219.06s)]
*  I'm not, I didn't have the puzzle pieces. [[03:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11223.019999999999s)]
*  That was not working. [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11225.38s)]
*  And then this is truly, going back to stories [[03:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11227.82s)]
*  and going back to shame. [[03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11229.66s)]
*  If you feel like you're the bad kid who's doing bad things, [[03:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11231.580000000002s)]
*  and you're the only one who's like that, [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11237.1s)]
*  you are shut down from learning. [[03:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11240.900000000001s)]
*  So I went up to him on the couch, [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11243.980000000001s)]
*  and my husband, I remember watching me being like, [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11245.300000000001s)]
*  what are you doing? [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11247.060000000001s)]
*  And this is how I started, I go, [[03:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11248.62s)]
*  I don't know if I can tell you this, which any kid's like, [[03:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11251.18s)]
*  I don't know if I can tell you this. [[03:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11254.5s)]
*  When I was probably about seven, [[03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11257.3s)]
*  I did something really bad. [[03:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11262.259999999998s)]
*  That's what I said, and he was like, I can't even tell you. [[03:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11264.34s)]
*  He like, every part of his anger like diffused. [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11267.539999999999s)]
*  And you can really draw a kid in by just saying to them, [[03:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11271.58s)]
*  I can't tell you, I've never told anyone. [[03:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11274.539999999999s)]
*  I go, okay, and this is true. [[03:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11276.14s)]
*  I go, my sister was too, [[03:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11278.46s)]
*  and she had these like oily stickers, [[03:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11281.9s)]
*  and I really wanted them. [[03:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11285.46s)]
*  And I asked my mom, and she said, [[03:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11287.5s)]
*  no, we couldn't go to the store, no, [[03:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11290.18s)]
*  those are my sister's stickers. [[03:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11291.34s)]
*  You're never gonna guess what I did. [[03:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11294.34s)]
*  And he was like, I don't know, you asked her for them, [[03:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11299.46s)]
*  you waited, you know? [[03:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11303.46s)]
*  And I was like, no, I took them. [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11305.42s)]
*  But that's not the worst part. [[03:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11309.58s)]
*  He's like, what? [[03:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11311.66s)]
*  And I go, my mom asked me if I took them. [[03:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11313.619999999999s)]
*  I knew I did, so you know what I told her, [[03:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11318.46s)]
*  and he said, you told her yes, and I go, no. [[03:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11320.619999999999s)]
*  I told her no. [[03:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11324.98s)]
*  And he literally goes. [[03:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11328.74s)]
*  And I feel like in that moment, [[03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11332.74s)]
*  what's happening is he's saying like so many things [[03:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11334.58s)]
*  that you can never say didactically, [[03:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11337.66s)]
*  like, mom, like, you're my mom, I love you. [[03:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11339.34s)]
*  I hold you on a pedestal, and like, even you [[03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11342.94s)]
*  did something that wasn't so great. [[03:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11348.1s)]
*  There's like so much hope and goodness. [[03:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11349.86s)]
*  And then I didn't, in that moment, [[03:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11352.66s)]
*  I did not say, and you cannot say in these situations, [[03:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11354.74s)]
*  so now you can tell me that you just have to like trust, [[03:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11357.66s)]
*  because I think the shame of the badness, [[03:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11361.94s)]
*  shame freezes you, right, as an animal defense state, [[03:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11365.9s)]
*  shame freezes you, so a kid who's lying to you [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11369.14s)]
*  is always in shame, and you can't get a kid to unfreeze [[03:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11372.9s)]
*  and move to a different place of telling you the truth [[03:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11378.42s)]
*  if you're adding more shame through fear, [[03:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11381.3s)]
*  like, the math doesn't work, but you can through stories. [[03:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11383.699999999999s)]
*  Now, true story, he did not right after that say, you know, [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11387.22s)]
*  I was just like, I remember my husband, [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11393.699999999999s)]
*  okay, when he's saying this, he was like, [[03:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11396.46s)]
*  we have to punish him, we have to, you know, [[03:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11398.300000000001s)]
*  we have to punish him. [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11399.5s)]
*  I was like, in the moment, [[03:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11400.58s)]
*  that's gonna feel very cathartic to us. [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11401.62s)]
*  That's what punishment does. [[03:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11403.1s)]
*  It makes you feel very powerful. [[03:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11404.02s)]
*  It makes you feel very cathartic. [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11405.5s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[03:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11407.42s)]
*  It just doesn't, especially not with kids [[03:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11408.62s)]
*  who are strong-willed. [[03:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11410.58s)]
*  I was like, just give it a couple days. [[03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11411.98s)]
*  It's probably a good three days later, [[03:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11414.94s)]
*  and he brought me the puzzle pieces in a bag, [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11417.7s)]
*  and he just said, I took them, [[03:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11422.02s)]
*  and he truly started crying. [[03:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11425.78s)]
*  And I did not lecture him. [[03:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11428.94s)]
*  I feel like the whole arc, the whole lesson [[03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11431.02s)]
*  had basically already happened. [[03:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11434.54s)]
*  Honestly, like the day after or so, [[03:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11436.9s)]
*  again, and this is what I think we miss as parents, [[03:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11439.06s)]
*  and like, we're almost afraid to like, [[03:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11440.74s)]
*  just name the humanness of it. [[03:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11442.86s)]
*  And I kind of gave an example earlier. [[03:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11444.54s)]
*  He's gonna wanna do something bad again. [[03:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11446.62s)]
*  We all want to do bad things. [[03:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11448.26s)]
*  That's not a bad urge. [[03:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11450.74s)]
*  It's just about having the skills to do something differently [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11451.82s)]
*  when you have the urge. [[03:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11454.5s)]
*  So I think a couple days later, and I do this, [[03:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11455.42s)]
*  I do these little like role plays. [[03:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11458.38s)]
*  They take like 20 seconds. [[03:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11459.22s)]
*  I was like, oh my goodness. [[03:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11460.38s)]
*  Look at the puzzle, [[03:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11463.22s)]
*  because we'd still been working on it. [[03:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11464.06s)]
*  What if you wanna take it again? [[03:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11465.34s)]
*  He goes, I won't. [[03:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11466.539999999999s)]
*  I go, I know, but I think you might want to. [[03:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11467.38s)]
*  Remember how I took the oilies? [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11469.86s)]
*  So you're acknowledging that inside him, [[03:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11472.98s)]
*  there might be a piece that still wants [[03:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11474.74s)]
*  to do the wrong thing. [[03:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11476.699999999999s)]
*  Feelings, and that's an urge. [[03:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11477.619999999999s)]
*  I teach my kids, an urge means you want to do something. [[03:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11479.3s)]
*  My kids will say, an urge is not a behavior. [[03:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11481.82s)]
*  Behavior is doing the thing. [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11483.98s)]
*  That's not okay. [[03:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11485.539999999999s)]
*  But the only reason your urge doesn't convert into behavior [[03:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11486.82s)]
*  is because you have a skill to manage the urge. [[03:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11489.699999999999s)]
*  And you can't build skills if no one teaches you them. [[03:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11491.98s)]
*  So I said, what could you do instead? [[03:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11494.98s)]
*  Could you run to me and say, [[03:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11497.5s)]
*  I really wanna take the pieces? [[03:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11498.58s)]
*  Can you say, I need time with you? [[03:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11500.26s)]
*  Because at the end of the day, I think he felt left out. [[03:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11501.66s)]
*  And we did. [[03:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11503.98s)]
*  And by the way, this kid, is he like perfect now? [[03:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11504.82s)]
*  No, but like it brings together so many things. [[03:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11506.539999999999s)]
*  It brings together so many things. [[03:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11509.94s)]
*  When number one, when we trust ourselves that we have time, [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11513.980000000001s)]
*  when we realize shame, the fear of being the only one, [[03:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11517.140000000001s)]
*  being bad, being unlovable, being alone [[03:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11520.26s)]
*  is often the biggest blocker for kids. [[03:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11522.460000000001s)]
*  When you really realize that, punishment [[03:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11524.86s)]
*  and sending your kid away makes no sense at all. [[03:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11527.580000000002s)]
*  And you can kind of give yourself freedom to tell stories. [[03:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11532.380000000001s)]
*  Right? [[03:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11536.300000000001s)]
*  Because when we're really struggling with something, [[03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11537.140000000001s)]
*  you don't wanna look at someone, [[03:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11540.419999999998s)]
*  especially someone who's perfect. [[03:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11541.699999999999s)]
*  Right? [[03:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11543.699999999999s)]
*  It's like when you really have a bad experience as an adult, [[03:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11544.539999999999s)]
*  the only thing you wanna hear is your friend who I don't like, [[03:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11546.66s)]
*  you know, I'm mortified. [[03:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11549.259999999998s)]
*  I sent this email to my boss. [[03:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11550.779999999999s)]
*  The only thing that would make me feel better [[03:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11553.5s)]
*  is someone like, let me show you the email I sent. [[03:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11555.099999999999s)]
*  I'm like, oh wow, that's worse. [[03:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11557.419999999998s)]
*  That's the only thing that makes you feel better. [[03:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11558.859999999999s)]
*  Not because I wish bad upon other people, [[03:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11560.3s)]
*  but because you wanna know you're not alone. [[03:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11561.98s)]
*  And other people's stories do that, like vulnerability. [[03:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11564.66s)]
*  It's kind of like, it's like this magic, this magic trick. [[03:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11568.3s)]
*  I mean, it's pretty far away from the parenting dynamic, [[03:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11572.66s)]
*  but the understanding and actual data [[03:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11576.14s)]
*  from like 12 step programs and group therapy generally, [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11580.74s)]
*  including trauma therapy that is of a group therapy nature, [[03:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11585.699999999999s)]
*  fully supports everything you said. [[03:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11590.859999999999s)]
*  Hearing the terrible and or humiliating things [[03:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11592.18s)]
*  that people have done or have done to them [[03:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11597.1s)]
*  as awful as that sounds, you know, [[03:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11599.1s)]
*  is often what underlies people's willingness to recover, [[03:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11600.5s)]
*  ability to recover, and then they become the teachers [[03:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11604.1s)]
*  over time. That's right. [[03:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11607.62s)]
*  Like you said, I think you said so many incredible things [[03:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11608.62s)]
*  there, but right at the end, you said something [[03:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11611.300000000001s)]
*  that I hope everyone internalizes, [[03:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11613.5s)]
*  that when you do something embarrassing, [[03:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11615.300000000001s)]
*  maybe even humiliating, the last thing you wanna hear is, [[03:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11618.7s)]
*  look, it's all gonna be fine. [[03:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11621.82s)]
*  The thing that actually helps is somebody [[03:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11623.62s)]
*  who has experienced something similar and is doing fine. [[03:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11625.42s)]
*  Yeah, and I use that at management. [[03:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11629.82s)]
*  Like we had someone do a presentation at work [[03:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11631.58s)]
*  and it was for a bunch of people and it did not go well. [[03:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11633.78s)]
*  And I met with her and she knew it kind of didn't go well. [[03:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11636.74s)]
*  And honestly, the only thing I said to her, [[03:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11639.14s)]
*  I don't even manage her directly, she's more junior. [[03:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11640.62s)]
*  And I really mean this, we had, [[03:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11643.18s)]
*  in clinical psychology grad school, like it's intense. [[03:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11644.66s)]
*  You do a session when you're first doing sessions [[03:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11647.02s)]
*  and like everyone's watching you. [[03:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11649.7s)]
*  They're like watching you do therapy, which is helpful. [[03:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11651.58s)]
*  But I remember my first one [[03:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11654.54s)]
*  and I felt like pretty okay about it. [[03:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11656.5s)]
*  I was like, this is my first one, I was okay. [[03:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11658.18s)]
*  I got torn to shreds. [[03:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11660.58s)]
*  They were like, that was not good, you know? [[03:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11662.58s)]
*  And now obviously I'm on the, [[03:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11664.98s)]
*  I feel good about my clinical abilities, [[03:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11666.7s)]
*  but the only thing I said to her is I was like, look, [[03:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11669.5s)]
*  and I shared it with her. [[03:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11673.02s)]
*  And I said like, I've been there. [[03:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11674.54s)]
*  Like eventually I look back on that, helped me learn. [[03:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11677.66s)]
*  That day I just fell awful. [[03:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11682.34s)]
*  I wasn't like, this is my learning space moment, you know? [[03:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11683.94s)]
*  And so if you're feeling like that, [[03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11686.62s)]
*  I just wanna let you know, like I've been there too. [[03:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11687.9s)]
*  This is the starting point to getting better. [[03:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11690.980000000001s)]
*  This is gonna like make you stronger. [[03:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11693.1s)]
*  I know that I've lived that. [[03:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11694.66s)]
*  And I think storytelling in that way [[03:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11696.460000000001s)]
*  is probably like a really underutilized kind of quote tool, [[03:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11698.980000000001s)]
*  almost dehumanizes it to call it that, [[03:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11702.220000000001s)]
*  in management, in any relationship. [[03:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11704.62s)]
*  Love it. [[03:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11708.140000000001s)]
*  And I feel like the story of your son [[03:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11708.980000000001s)]
*  bringing those puzzle pieces back is like, [[03:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11711.140000000001s)]
*  there's so much there. [[03:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11714.300000000001s)]
*  So much. [[03:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11715.62s)]
*  And the fact that there was a delay [[03:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11716.460000000001s)]
*  and then he brought it back on his own accord [[03:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11717.9s)]
*  and that you had already kind of let it go, [[03:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11721.060000000001s)]
*  that's, I feel like a really interesting piece. [[03:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11724.1s)]
*  It wasn't to like appease you, [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11726.42s)]
*  it was really something internal for him. [[03:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11728.7s)]
*  Like he got the lesson for him. [[03:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11730.300000000001s)]
*  It wasn't just about like making mom feel okay about him. [[03:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11733.980000000001s)]
*  Like he clearly understood you still love him, [[03:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11737.18s)]
*  but it wasn't about like fixing something externally, [[03:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11738.86s)]
*  as much as it was about fixing something internally, [[03:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11742.38s)]
*  which I think is the addressing [[03:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11744.38s)]
*  and overcoming the shame piece. [[03:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11746.859999999999s)]
*  I think that's right. [[03:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11748.46s)]
*  And that's the thing. [[03:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11749.3s)]
*  Like I think sometimes it's like, [[03:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11750.3s)]
*  are we teaching kids what to think or how to think? [[03:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11752.179999999998s)]
*  Like after they're gone from our house, [[03:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11756.339999999998s)]
*  like it's the how to think. [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11758.099999999999s)]
*  And you said questions. [[03:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11759.179999999998s)]
*  I love kind of stochastic questions for kids. [[03:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11760.98s)]
*  Like, oh, if again, a different version of a story [[03:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11764.3s)]
*  would be like, oh, okay, [[03:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11766.98s)]
*  I know you didn't take the puzzle pieces, [[03:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11768.98s)]
*  but I'm just thinking for me, [[03:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11770.58s)]
*  like what would make me take puzzle pieces? [[03:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11771.54s)]
*  Oh, I wonder if I felt left out [[03:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11775.740000000002s)]
*  or I wonder if I was just really trying [[03:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11777.980000000001s)]
*  to get my parents' attention for a while [[03:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11780.1s)]
*  and this was the only way to do it. [[03:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11781.460000000001s)]
*  And what would I do after? [[03:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11782.62s)]
*  And what would I need? [[03:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11784.820000000002s)]
*  Now I'm gonna get emotional. [[03:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11786.660000000002s)]
*  What would I need to know about myself or from my parent [[03:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11788.54s)]
*  for me to share that I did take it? [[03:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11792.94s)]
*  Maybe I would need to know that my parents knew [[03:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11796.26s)]
*  I was a good kid. [[03:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11798.980000000001s)]
*  Anyway, sorry, what were we talking about? [[03:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11800.86s)]
*  Like, cause your kids eventually make a decision, [[03:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11802.54s)]
*  adults make good decisions for themselves [[03:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11806.66s)]
*  because they ask themselves the right questions. [[03:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11808.58s)]
*  Not because they've heard their parents' specific lesson, [[03:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11812.66s)]
*  right, because they're able to say to themselves, [[03:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11815.900000000001s)]
*  like, what am I feeling right now? [[03:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11817.54s)]
*  What am I really looking for? [[03:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11818.86s)]
*  Why did I do that? [[03:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11819.900000000001s)]
*  So like asking questions, telling stories, [[03:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11821.1s)]
*  asking questions without even answering them [[03:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11823.220000000001s)]
*  actually provokes a much more sophisticated [[03:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11825.94s)]
*  developmental process in your kid [[03:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11828.62s)]
*  than the lectures we all, me included. [[03:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11830.980000000001s)]
*  Trust me, plenty of times at my kid [[03:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11834.5s)]
*  that I've just lectured them. [[03:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11835.900000000001s)]
*  But again, they're just catharsis. [[03:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11837.5s)]
*  They're not actually terribly effective. [[03:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11838.7s)]
*  Yeah, if ever there was some core truths [[03:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11841.460000000001s)]
*  about brain plasticity, it's that frustration [[03:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11845.02s)]
*  is associated with the chemicals that foster brain change. [[03:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11848.86s)]
*  We know that. [[03:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11852.7s)]
*  And that questions have a really interesting impact [[03:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11853.54s)]
*  on learning. [[03:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11857.26s)]
*  Which sounds kind of like a duh. [[03:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11859.3s)]
*  Well, of course they do. [[03:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11860.14s)]
*  But when we ask questions, it creates this open loop [[03:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11860.98s)]
*  in the brain that the brain wants to solve [[03:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11862.619999999999s)]
*  as opposed to hearing a statement. [[03:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11864.58s)]
*  This is why I always felt like those pictures [[03:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11866.46s)]
*  on office walls, like motivation, when you blah, blah, blah. [[03:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11869.22s)]
*  Like the motivational statements don't mean much [[03:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11872.46s)]
*  in terms of, because they're not about verb states. [[03:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11876.14s)]
*  When we ask questions, we put our brain [[03:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11879.38s)]
*  into kind of a process of verb states, [[03:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11881.099999999999s)]
*  of asking what behaviors are gonna lead to which outcomes. [[03:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11883.339999999998s)]
*  There's an interesting literature about this [[03:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11886.14s)]
*  that probably isn't fully relevant here. [[03:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11888.859999999999s)]
*  But it gets back to trying to learn basic motor tasks [[03:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11890.22s)]
*  and the same things are applied to basic cognitive tasks. [[03:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11892.859999999999s)]
*  So like, how do I solve this? [[03:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11895.1s)]
*  And that puzzle is a great example [[03:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11896.539999999999s)]
*  because it's both cognitive and motor. [[03:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11899.5s)]
*  Like you're fixing these pieces in different ways. [[03:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11901.5s)]
*  I have to get back to doing some puzzles I'm realizing. [[03:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11903.9s)]
*  And emotional. [[03:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11906.26s)]
*  I can really embarrass myself. [[03:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11907.66s)]
*  But one of my favorite things that I, again, [[03:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11908.98s)]
*  I've just noticed my kids extending for puzzles [[03:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11910.699999999999s)]
*  because they all did a lot of puzzles when they were young [[03:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11913.26s)]
*  is so funny. [[03:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11914.82s)]
*  I remember my kid doing like this puzzle [[03:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11916.14s)]
*  and getting some frustration. [[03:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11918.74s)]
*  What I did is I did a puzzle to the side of him. [[03:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11919.859999999999s)]
*  Instead of doing it perfectly, I kind of like mimicked. [[03:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11923.779999999999s)]
*  I was like, oh, this doesn't fit. [[03:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11926.42s)]
*  Oh, it's not that piece. [[03:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11928.34s)]
*  Okay. [[03:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11929.58s)]
*  And one of the things I noticed [[03:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11930.42s)]
*  is when my kid was really young, [[03:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11931.26s)]
*  he, kids have a really hard time with puzzles [[03:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11933.66s)]
*  and it's kind of a metaphor for life. [[03:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11935.66s)]
*  For when a piece doesn't fit, they keep trying it. [[03:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11937.539999999999s)]
*  When what they really need to do is, [[03:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11941.539999999999s)]
*  such a metaphor is put it down [[03:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11943.26s)]
*  and pick up another piece, right? [[03:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11946.019999999999s)]
*  But I could tell my kid that, [[03:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11949.1s)]
*  but I'm not, I always feel like [[03:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11950.34s)]
*  just telling doesn't really work. [[03:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11951.42s)]
*  So this is what I did. [[03:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11952.42s)]
*  I'm not joking. [[03:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11953.26s)]
*  I'm gonna sing. [[03:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11954.699999999999s)]
*  Okay, get ready, okay? [[03:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11955.539999999999s)]
*  So I was doing it over here and I just go, [[03:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11956.58s)]
*  oh, it's not fitting. [[03:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11958.42s)]
*  It's not fitting here. [[03:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11959.34s)]
*  It's not fitting here. [[03:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11960.18s)]
*  And I go, [[03:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11961.06s)]
*  if it doesn't fit, [[03:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11962.82s)]
*  put it to the side [[03:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11965.66s)]
*  and try another piece. [[03:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11967.699999999999s)]
*  And then I was like, oh, right. [[03:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11972.38s)]
*  I can put it to the side. [[03:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11974.66s)]
*  Okay, I'll get this one. [[03:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11976.3s)]
*  And I didn't make a perfect, I was like, oh, oh, oh. [[03:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11977.38s)]
*  That one fits there, right? [[03:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11981.58s)]
*  I have heard, not anymore, my kids are too old, [[03:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11985.339999999998s)]
*  but there was a time, I remember me and my husband [[03:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11987.98s)]
*  were like outside the playroom and we heard our son, [[03:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11989.779999999999s)]
*  like singing this song. [[03:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11993.939999999999s)]
*  It's just, it's a mantra. [[03:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11995.539999999999s)]
*  It's self-regulation because is it cognitive? [[03:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=11996.82s)]
*  Is it physical? [[03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12000.539999999999s)]
*  It's also emotional. [[03:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12001.619999999999s)]
*  It goes back to frustration tolerance, [[03:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12002.86s)]
*  where our kids need, they need mantras, they need skills, [[03:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12004.900000000001s)]
*  they need songs to actually up-level their skills [[03:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12007.460000000001s)]
*  to regulate the emotions [[03:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12011.94s)]
*  that get in their way of doing great things, right? [[03:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12014.7s)]
*  And that kid is interesting, like not really anymore. [[03:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12017.66s)]
*  Now that I think about it, I wanna revive it. [[03:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12021.82s)]
*  He makes up songs through situations. [[03:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12023.380000000001s)]
*  What an amazing skill, right? [[03:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12026.380000000001s)]
*  But this stuff can like, and if anyone's hearing this, [[03:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12028.78s)]
*  I call that unrealistic, like it's amazing you do it one time. [[03:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12032.06s)]
*  One time, make up a silly song, [[03:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12035.46s)]
*  model the frustration yourself, make up a song, [[03:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12037.66s)]
*  struggle again, and then get success. [[03:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12041.02s)]
*  Whatever it is, it could be with reading, [[03:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12043.38s)]
*  with a puzzle, with putting on your sock. [[03:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12045.46s)]
*  It could be, oh, it doesn't fit. [[03:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12047.5s)]
*  I'm taking a deep breath and trying it again. [[03:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12050.699999999999s)]
*  It could literally be anything [[03:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12054.5s)]
*  because it adds a little play and joy. [[03:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12056.26s)]
*  And you probably know what song does in the brain [[03:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12057.699999999999s)]
*  better than I do, but probably regulating. [[03:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12059.06s)]
*  I would put money, that's so weird. [[03:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12062.74s)]
*  Becky, you're right, it didn't take that much time. [[03:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12065.9s)]
*  I did it one time and my kids started singing the song [[03:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12067.06s)]
*  and now they put their socks on by themselves. [[03:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12069.539999999999s)]
*  I love it. [[03:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12071.98s)]
*  You taught a process through song [[03:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12072.82s)]
*  and there actually is a lot of data on music in the brain [[03:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12074.34s)]
*  and how it organizes things mostly in the form of a story [[03:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12077.94s)]
*  of a beginning, middle, and end. [[03:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12080.58s)]
*  And just the quickest example I can give is [[03:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12081.699999999999s)]
*  when we learn our ABCs, we learn them in song. [[03:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12083.98s)]
*  ABC, you never forget that, right? [[03:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12088.06s)]
*  It's much easier to learn things through rhythmic song, [[03:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12092.74s)]
*  little motifs, than it is through a list of letters [[03:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12096.14s)]
*  or numbers. [[03:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12100.74s)]
*  Does our brain encode it differently? [[03:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12101.58s)]
*  Yeah, so it fragments it into a beginning, middle, and end [[03:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12102.82s)]
*  and then there's an underlying repetitive sort of wave. [[03:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12105.82s)]
*  A, B, C, D, E, G, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, [[03:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12108.22s)]
*  okay, here I'm now, I'm singing. [[03:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12110.38s)]
*  So, at risk of inducing all sorts of bad neural responses [[03:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12111.58s)]
*  and listeners, but you get the point. [[03:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12118.14s)]
*  It's a wave form that the brain can recognize. [[03:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12120.26s)]
*  I actually have a friend who's a very accomplished musician [[03:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12123.380000000001s)]
*  and I know the lyrics to his songs very well. [[03:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12126.02s)]
*  And I said, remember that song? [[03:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12127.86s)]
*  And he goes, well, I have to hear the underlying melody. [[03:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12129.26s)]
*  And then he can remember all the words. [[03:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12131.9s)]
*  He's a singer, he's a lead singer [[03:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12133.54s)]
*  in a very well-known band. [[03:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12134.94s)]
*  He doesn't even know the words to his own songs [[03:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12136.74s)]
*  if you just ask them for him, but you give him the music [[03:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12138.42s)]
*  and he's just out the gate. [[03:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12141.300000000001s)]
*  And he can do this in front of tens of thousands of people. [[03:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12142.82s)]
*  So then it is a cheat code for coping skills [[03:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12145.14s)]
*  if you put it to song. [[03:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12147.42s)]
*  It becomes a verb process. [[03:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12148.5s)]
*  Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off there. [[03:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12150.58s)]
*  It's almost like saying like, [[03:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12151.78s)]
*  oh, the mechanics of writing are you pick up, [[03:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12152.62s)]
*  you put the pen between you, you know, [[03:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12154.34s)]
*  there's a whole rhythm to writing. [[03:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12156.34s)]
*  There's a whole sequence of a motor sequence that we learn [[03:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12159.14s)]
*  or eating or anything for that matter. [[03:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12162.42s)]
*  No one who's an expert piano player thinks about [[03:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12165.3s)]
*  playing the individual keys at the point [[03:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12167.58s)]
*  where they've learned it, they've batched it into, [[03:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12168.94s)]
*  it's sort of like chunking, but it has an underlying rhythm [[03:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12171.82s)]
*  that's carried by a neural circuit [[03:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12174.78s)]
*  that allows the expression of the movements of the fingers [[03:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12176.5s)]
*  or the words out the mouth, or in this case, [[03:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12179.22s)]
*  overcoming frustration to just kind of ride on top [[03:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12181.26s)]
*  of all of it. [[03:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12183.9s)]
*  So there's an unconscious genius to what you did. [[03:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12184.9s)]
*  And I love it. [[03:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12189.06s)]
*  Maybe as long as nobody hears me sing, [[03:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12189.9s)]
*  I'll need to sing more to get through frustration. [[03:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12192.54s)]
*  I have a question about Ms. Edson. [[03:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12198.34s)]
*  Yes. [[03:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12202.18s)]
*  People are gonna be like, what? [[03:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12203.06s)]
*  Before we started recording, you shared with us [[03:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12205.02s)]
*  something I think is entirely appropriate [[03:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12207.82s)]
*  to what we're talking about now, [[03:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12209.34s)]
*  which is learning and learning hard things [[03:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12210.300000000001s)]
*  and frustration tolerance. [[03:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12213.34s)]
*  And you've evolved these concepts, you know, [[03:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12215.140000000001s)]
*  in the course of your work and through your own [[03:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12219.300000000001s)]
*  parenting child relationships, clearly your own [[03:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12221.42s)]
*  and then yours with your kids. [[03:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12224.460000000001s)]
*  Who was Ms. Edson and what did she teach you? [[03:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12226.58s)]
*  Because when you told me this, I was like, whoa, [[03:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12228.300000000001s)]
*  that's super valuable. [[03:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12230.66s)]
*  We all need to know about this. [[03:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12231.9s)]
*  Yes, so Ms. Edson was my second grade teacher. [[03:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12233.46s)]
*  And I remember writing in her class. [[03:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12236.66s)]
*  And I remember something she told us, [[03:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12240.3s)]
*  and it's truly something that shapes me every day. [[03:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12242.859999999999s)]
*  And she said, if something feels too hard to start, [[03:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12245.3s)]
*  it just means that the first step isn't small enough. [[03:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12250.22s)]
*  And then she really kind of made this even more concrete [[03:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12255.06s)]
*  because what I remember in her class writing, [[03:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12259.419999999998s)]
*  and I still use this in writing today is, [[03:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12262.18s)]
*  okay, so if something feels too hard to do, [[03:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12264.779999999999s)]
*  the implication is, it doesn't mean it's my fault. [[03:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12267.34s)]
*  It doesn't mean I can't. [[03:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12269.74s)]
*  It doesn't mean I'm stupid. [[03:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12271.099999999999s)]
*  It literally just means the first step isn't small enough. [[03:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12272.099999999999s)]
*  That's very actionable. [[03:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12275.019999999999s)]
*  And so the way I play around with it now, [[03:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12277.34s)]
*  even in my own writing is, okay, I have to write [[03:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12281.099999999999s)]
*  a new article. [[03:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12283.619999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, I can't do that. [[03:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12284.539999999999s)]
*  Okay, so I'm in I can't mode. [[03:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12286.46s)]
*  Okay, if something is in I can't mode, [[03:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12287.66s)]
*  if it feels too hard, I hear her voice. [[03:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12289.82s)]
*  It just means the first step isn't small enough. [[03:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12291.660000000002s)]
*  So I'll make it literally, I'll just make it smaller. [[03:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12293.460000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna write a page today. [[03:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12296.220000000001s)]
*  And then often I'm like, I can't do that. [[03:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12297.5s)]
*  Okay, smaller, a paragraph, no. [[03:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12299.42s)]
*  And I literally do it until, and some days it's a word. [[03:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12302.740000000002s)]
*  And I go, oh, you know what? [[03:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12305.62s)]
*  I can write a word. [[03:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12308.18s)]
*  Okay, now I'm not, okay, right. [[03:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12309.660000000002s)]
*  And I really think Miss Edson was ahead of her time. [[03:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12312.5s)]
*  I mean, obviously now we talk a lot about frustration, [[03:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12316.54s)]
*  tolerance, growth mindset, [[03:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12318.300000000001s)]
*  but this really is a way of saying, [[03:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12320.06s)]
*  when things are hard, it's not your fault. [[03:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12323.619999999999s)]
*  And there's something you can do [[03:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12326.14s)]
*  to build the circuit of capability. [[03:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12327.98s)]
*  Because I think when we're trying to do something hard, [[03:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12330.38s)]
*  there are like, if you think about it, [[03:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12332.859999999999s)]
*  I don't know, you're on the top of a ski mountain. [[03:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12334.14s)]
*  And on the one side is that I can't, it's too hard. [[03:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12336.939999999999s)]
*  And the other side is I can. [[03:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12340.22s)]
*  We all have natural capability. [[03:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12343.019999999999s)]
*  I really believe this every person. [[03:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12346.1s)]
*  But it's just about figuring out how to get your skis [[03:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12348.66s)]
*  like to the beginning of the ski slope. [[03:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12352.06s)]
*  And then maybe if we've practiced [[03:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12353.86s)]
*  being on the I can't do hard things slope, [[03:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12355.74s)]
*  our skis keep trying to turn, [[03:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12358.58s)]
*  but we just have to keep getting them back. [[03:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12359.9s)]
*  And so if we tell ourselves I can't do this [[03:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12362.42s)]
*  and we just stay there, stagnant. [[03:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12365.02s)]
*  But if you say, wait, smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller. [[03:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12367.94s)]
*  Like I used this with a client a while ago. [[03:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12372.06s)]
*  I can't ask my boss for a raise. [[03:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12374.26s)]
*  I know I deserve it. [[03:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12375.66s)]
*  Cool, no problem. [[03:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12376.98s)]
*  Let's make it smaller. [[03:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12378.86s)]
*  Okay, what would be smaller? [[03:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12379.86s)]
*  I don't know, let's get creative. [[03:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12381.58s)]
*  Could you write down what you would say? [[03:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12383.22s)]
*  Okay, no. [[03:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12385.86s)]
*  Could you say the word to me five times out loud? [[03:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12387.22s)]
*  Raise, raise, raise, raise, raise. [[03:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12391.26s)]
*  I remember she laughed. [[03:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12393.22s)]
*  She goes, I can do that. [[03:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12394.06s)]
*  Cool, let's start there. [[03:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12394.880000000001s)]
*  Okay, she literally did that. [[03:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12395.72s)]
*  What I think is so powerful about Ms. Edson's advice [[03:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12397.7s)]
*  is as soon as we get even our skis a tiny bit [[03:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12401.460000000001s)]
*  into the I can circuit, the I can slope, [[03:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12404.86s)]
*  it's actually just a lot more likely to stay there [[03:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12409.22s)]
*  or at least that becomes a bigger part of our identity. [[03:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12411.38s)]
*  Right? [[03:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12415.38s)]
*  So with this woman that I was working on this with, [[03:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12416.22s)]
*  one of the things we were working on, [[03:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12418.46s)]
*  it was just, okay, so you did that. [[03:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12420.179999999998s)]
*  Amazing. [[03:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12421.9s)]
*  The next thing, I even just had her play around things [[03:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12423.019999999999s)]
*  saying to me, can you say to me, I deserve a raise? [[03:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12424.619999999999s)]
*  It was very interesting. [[03:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12427.14s)]
*  She had, I think this was one of the reasons [[03:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12428.22s)]
*  she had trouble speaking up for it. [[03:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12430.099999999999s)]
*  It was really hard for her to embody that. [[03:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12432.26s)]
*  We said that. [[03:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12434.42s)]
*  She couldn't, I remember a week she said, [[03:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12435.74s)]
*  she couldn't bring it, she didn't. [[03:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12437.38s)]
*  Again, I like parenting. [[03:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12439.14s)]
*  I didn't punish her. [[03:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12440.5s)]
*  I didn't send her to her room. [[03:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12441.699999999999s)]
*  I said, okay, that was just too big. [[03:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12442.859999999999s)]
*  Let's make it smaller. [[03:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12444.42s)]
*  Let's write it together. [[03:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12445.259999999998s)]
*  Wrote some things down there. [[03:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12446.42s)]
*  Right? [[03:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12448.06s)]
*  I then had her write it as an email and send it to me. [[03:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12448.9s)]
*  And I then had her practice it with her best friend. [[03:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12452.9s)]
*  And then she asked her boss for a raise. [[03:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12456.98s)]
*  Like, I mean, I don't even, [[03:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12459.779999999999s)]
*  probably no one's surprised. [[03:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12461.58s)]
*  Yeah, like that makes sense. [[03:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12462.42s)]
*  She'd gone through a lot of steps. [[03:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12463.42s)]
*  But it's just applicable in every area of your life. [[03:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12465.22s)]
*  So even anyone listening, [[03:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12467.82s)]
*  we all have something in our I can't category. [[03:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12469.3s)]
*  This is too hard or I can't. [[03:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12471.5s)]
*  And we just stay there. [[03:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12473.58s)]
*  And if you hear Ms. Edson saying, [[03:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12474.619999999999s)]
*  wait, if something feels too hard to do, [[03:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12478.3s)]
*  it only means that the first step isn't small enough. [[03:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12481.58s)]
*  And if then the next smallest step feels too hard, [[03:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12484.58s)]
*  no biggie, like no judgment, [[03:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12487.26s)]
*  make it smaller, make it smaller, make it smaller, [[03:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12489.34s)]
*  and then allow yourself to eventually build up from there. [[03:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12492.26s)]
*  Love it. [[03:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12496.06s)]
*  Love Ms. Edson. [[03:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12496.9s)]
*  I'm gonna thank you and Ms. Edson. [[03:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12497.74s)]
*  Yes, thank you, Ms. Edson. [[03:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12500.06s)]
*  I think the idea of lowering the stakes [[03:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12502.26s)]
*  to be able to move forward is just spectacular. [[03:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12505.98s)]
*  And in everything. [[03:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12509.34s)]
*  And I noticed you do that, [[03:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12511.38s)]
*  by the way, I'm not like analyzing, [[03:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12514.099999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying you do that with parenting. [[03:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12515.58s)]
*  I think there's so much tension around this notion [[03:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12518.099999999999s)]
*  of like creating healthy, productive, functional kids. [[03:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12520.9s)]
*  And I think there is a lot of shame for parents [[03:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12524.74s)]
*  when things aren't going great and people know it [[03:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12527.22s)]
*  or they know it. [[03:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12530.1s)]
*  And the idea of creating lower stakes [[03:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12531.26s)]
*  in order to be able to make pretty big moves over time [[03:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12535.5s)]
*  where they're required or just do nothing [[03:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12539.699999999999s)]
*  when sometimes that's what's required. [[03:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12542.34s)]
*  Yeah, and the similarity is so interesting. [[03:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12544.1s)]
*  What I think that the powerful thing [[03:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12546.22s)]
*  about Ms. Edson's advice is she's almost saying, [[03:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12547.699999999999s)]
*  make something small enough so you can get your first win. [[03:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12551.26s)]
*  Having a win is really powerful. [[03:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12555.06s)]
*  It's kind of addicting. [[03:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12556.98s)]
*  You're like, what's my next win? [[03:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12558.06s)]
*  You're on the wind circuit. [[03:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12559.26s)]
*  One of the reasons we wanna create [[03:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12560.98s)]
*  so many more resources for parents. [[03:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12564.94s)]
*  And when parents come to us and even say, [[03:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12566.58s)]
*  this is a problem, this is a problem, this is a problem, [[03:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12569.22s)]
*  I often just start, I would say, okay, [[03:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12571.54s)]
*  what is the smallest thing would change [[03:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12574.42s)]
*  that would make you when you go to bed at night? [[03:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12576.26s)]
*  Be like, today was a better day. [[03:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12577.9s)]
*  Like there's some bigger stuff, I hear you. [[03:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12579.82s)]
*  Probably not gonna tackle that. [[03:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12581.9s)]
*  I wanna get you a win today. [[03:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12583.02s)]
*  And then all of a sudden when a parent starts to build, [[03:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12587.14s)]
*  it's kind of their own self-efficacy, [[03:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12590.42s)]
*  their own like, oh wait, [[03:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12592.22s)]
*  I did feel good about that one moment. [[03:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12593.779999999999s)]
*  I did feel more connected to my kid. [[03:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12595.699999999999s)]
*  I said this one thing. [[03:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12597.18s)]
*  It's momentum. [[03:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12599.18s)]
*  And we have to give ourselves the opportunity [[03:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12602.42s)]
*  to build momentum, which really usually only starts [[03:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12604.06s)]
*  by taking the smallest step anyway. [[03:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12608.3s)]
*  I think it's spectacular. [[03:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12611.78s)]
*  I was going to ask you, and I never do this, [[03:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12613.34s)]
*  but I was gonna ask you, if there were one thing [[03:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12617.060000000001s)]
*  that people could start the process [[03:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12619.26s)]
*  of trying to be a better parent, better to themselves, [[03:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12621.060000000001s)]
*  if it's more about emotional containment, et cetera, [[03:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12624.1s)]
*  maybe it's this thing of asking at the end of today, [[03:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12627.58s)]
*  what would be one thing that would allow me [[03:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12631.300000000001s)]
*  to have said it was a better day? [[03:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12632.900000000001s)]
*  Would that be it? [[03:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12634.26s)]
*  And certainly that's powerful. [[03:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12635.1s)]
*  I'm gonna give you two things. [[03:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12635.94s)]
*  One is kind of a one small thing, [[03:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12637.220000000001s)]
*  but it's kind of a bigger theoretical thing. [[03:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12639.54s)]
*  And one thing is very, very, very concrete. [[03:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12641.740000000002s)]
*  So the bigger thing. [[03:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12646.140000000001s)]
*  I really believe that the single biggest thing [[03:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12647.78s)]
*  that gets in our way of feeling more empowered [[03:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12649.980000000001s)]
*  and capable as parents is that as much as we say, [[03:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12653.740000000002s)]
*  we value parenting, and I think parents, [[03:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12657.460000000001s)]
*  people do, or parents are like, yeah, [[03:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12659.300000000001s)]
*  what do I care about more than parenting? [[03:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12660.7s)]
*  It's kind of the lowest on our list [[03:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12662.7s)]
*  in terms of what we invest in. [[03:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12664.7s)]
*  People invest in all types of things. [[03:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12667.14s)]
*  And I wanna be clear, yes, [[03:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12669.619999999999s)]
*  like we have an offering at Good Inside in our membership, [[03:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12671.539999999999s)]
*  but that's not what I mean. [[03:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12675.06s)]
*  For someone listening, they might be like, [[03:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12676.099999999999s)]
*  there is that parent coach in my town [[03:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12677.619999999999s)]
*  who I've been like saying I'm gonna call, [[03:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12679.539999999999s)]
*  or maybe it's a therapist, [[03:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12682.019999999999s)]
*  or maybe it's a parenting group at your school, [[03:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12682.98s)]
*  or maybe someone listens to me and they're like, [[03:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12684.859999999999s)]
*  no offense, Dr. Becky, [[03:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12687.38s)]
*  there's someone else I follow on Instagram [[03:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12688.38s)]
*  and they have a course and I like them better. [[03:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12689.939999999999s)]
*  I'd be like, do that today. [[03:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12692.779999999999s)]
*  Align your even purchasing decisions with your values. [[03:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12695.779999999999s)]
*  Because we're not expected to know this naturally. [[03:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12702.099999999999s)]
*  We're not. [[03:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12705.66s)]
*  And as long as we don't have the resources around us, [[03:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12706.5s)]
*  a little kind of, someone described it to me [[03:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12709.5s)]
*  as like a onesie twosie thing. [[03:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12711.419999999998s)]
*  It's just not giving ourself what we deserve. [[03:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12714.22s)]
*  It is like a surgeon saying, [[03:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12717.3s)]
*  they're not good at surgery when you find out [[03:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12719.5s)]
*  they never went to medical school or residency. [[03:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12721.099999999999s)]
*  You'd be like, well, [[03:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12723.5s)]
*  I just didn't really get resourced [[03:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12724.3s)]
*  in the way you deserve for this very challenging job. [[03:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12726.14s)]
*  So that would really be the thing if I'm really honest, [[03:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12728.619999999999s)]
*  because I'm not, as much as I'm about a quick win, [[03:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12730.82s)]
*  I'm not about a quick fix. [[03:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12733.099999999999s)]
*  I think that just sets us up for more, like a bandaid. [[03:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12734.539999999999s)]
*  Having said that, I love a quick thing. [[03:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12738.22s)]
*  So a couple of things I think people can do with their kids. [[03:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12740.9s)]
*  Telling your kid at night, and I'll model how I would say it, [[03:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12744.56s)]
*  I think most people, it's not just me, [[03:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12747.66s)]
*  when you put your kid to bed, [[03:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12748.9s)]
*  it's like, oh, you're like, I just wanna be on the couch, [[03:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12750.66s)]
*  but it's when your kid's willing [[03:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12752.3s)]
*  to spend five extra minutes with you, [[03:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12753.3s)]
*  because it's the cruel irony at night, [[03:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12755.019999999999s)]
*  you want time without your kids, [[03:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12757.019999999999s)]
*  and they just want a little bit more time with you. [[03:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12758.06s)]
*  If you allow yourself to lean in, [[03:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12760.259999999998s)]
*  and you can just say to your kid, [[03:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12762.34s)]
*  almost like in a whisper, [[03:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12763.939999999999s)]
*  I think whispering to your kid [[03:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12764.859999999999s)]
*  is one of the most underutilized simplest strategies. [[03:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12767.06s)]
*  Whispers are so sacred, they feel sacred, [[03:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12769.22s)]
*  and they feel like they know they're just for you. [[03:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12771.42s)]
*  Whispering to your kid, like, I just wanna tell you, [[03:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12773.359999999999s)]
*  there's nothing you could ever do [[03:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12778.74s)]
*  that would make me stop loving you. [[03:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12780.22s)]
*  Or, I just wanna tell you, you're a really good kid. [[03:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12783.3s)]
*  We're in a hard stage, but I will never, ever, [[03:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12788.98s)]
*  ever think of you as anything but a really good kid. [[03:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12793.74s)]
*  Don't expect your kid to say anything. [[03:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12798.099999999999s)]
*  But just, that takes 10 seconds. [[03:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12801.06s)]
*  And if you're like, whispering feels awkward, [[03:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12804.779999999999s)]
*  don't whisper, just say it. [[03:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12806.42s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you're thinking, [[03:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12807.259999999998s)]
*  you don't know my kid, they're a teenager, [[03:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12809.22s)]
*  text them, text them. [[03:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12811.26s)]
*  Sometimes a text to a teen can feel like an unexpected [[03:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12813.86s)]
*  whisper from a parent, you know? [[03:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12816.1s)]
*  And that's it. [[03:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12818.54s)]
*  And that's the single thing today. [[03:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12820.14s)]
*  And then maybe, I'm an out of third, [[03:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12822.86s)]
*  just do something like that for yourself. [[03:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12824.9s)]
*  Give yourself credit, put your hand on your heart, [[03:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12826.14s)]
*  tell yourself, is parenting things really hard? [[03:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12827.78s)]
*  Like, I'm doing enough, [[03:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12831.300000000001s)]
*  I'm not messing up my kid forever, that's not a thing. [[03:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12834.1s)]
*  Like, and I've got this. [[03:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12837.300000000001s)]
*  Awesome. [[03:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12839.54s)]
*  Well, this whole thing that you've attempted to take on [[03:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12841.380000000001s)]
*  is also really hard and you're doing incredible work [[03:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12845.86s)]
*  educating people on how to parent. [[03:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12849.34s)]
*  There's so many things that you've said today, [[03:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12851.140000000001s)]
*  I'm not gonna recap them all. [[03:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12852.580000000002s)]
*  You know, we do timestamps and all that [[03:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12854.220000000001s)]
*  so people can find them, but in no particular order. [[03:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12855.78s)]
*  I mean, you know, this concept of telling your kid [[03:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12859.02s)]
*  your right to notice when they notice something important [[03:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12863.5s)]
*  in you or in others or in themselves, [[03:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12867.38s)]
*  that rigidity is the enemy. [[03:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12870.94s)]
*  Asking like, what's this really about [[03:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12874.98s)]
*  when they're doing or saying something [[03:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12877.46s)]
*  or expressing themselves in a way that feels confusing [[03:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12879.5s)]
*  or maybe, especially when it's irritating. [[03:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12881.539999999999s)]
*  Encouraging frustration as a route to learning, [[03:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12886.9s)]
*  like incredible. [[03:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12889.86s)]
*  And then you said, the more that you can locate somebody, [[03:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12892.5s)]
*  the more you respect their values, [[03:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12895.86s)]
*  which I think is incredible. [[03:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12898.38s)]
*  And on and on, I mean, there's so many gems [[03:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12900.9s)]
*  in today's conversation and so many actionable gems [[03:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12903.82s)]
*  that you provide on social media through your courses, [[03:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12907.26s)]
*  through conversations like this [[03:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12913.06s)]
*  and others that you're holding in other podcasts. [[03:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12914.5s)]
*  And I just wanna thank you so much. [[03:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12916.9s)]
*  You know, you're teaching people how to parent others, [[03:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12919.46s)]
*  how to think about their own parenting. [[03:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12923.82s)]
*  Oh yes, that's the other one. [[03:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12925.54s)]
*  You said the only kind of parenting [[03:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12926.820000000002s)]
*  that we do reflexively is the one that was done for us, [[03:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12928.300000000001s)]
*  which will evoke, you know, feelings of relaxation [[03:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12931.7s)]
*  in some people and feelings of dread in others. [[03:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12935.660000000002s)]
*  But it all just speaks to the importance of paying attention [[03:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12938.460000000001s)]
*  to this thing that we call parenting. [[03:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12941.02s)]
*  And I think the way that you're merging this [[03:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12942.820000000002s)]
*  with a thoughtful eye on technology, [[03:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12945.900000000001s)]
*  where it's taking us and where there are concerns [[03:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12948.5s)]

*  about the work that you're doing [[03:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi4VwpEs3LE&t=12956.02s)]
