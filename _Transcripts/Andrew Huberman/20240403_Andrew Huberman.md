# Dr. Matt: The Biology of Sleep & Your Unique Sleep Needs | Huberman Lab Guest Series
**Andrew Huberman:** [April 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OBCwiPPfEU)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab guest series,
*  where I and an expert guest discuss science
*  and science-based tools for everyday life.
*  I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
*  and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
*  Today's episode marks the first
*  in our six episode series, All About Sleep.
*  Our expert guest for this series is Dr. Matthew Walker,
*  professor of neuroscience and psychology,
*  and the director of the Center for Sleep Science
*  at the University of California, Berkeley.
*  He is also the author of the bestselling book,
*  Why We Sleep.
*  During the course of the six episode series
*  for which we release one episode per week,
*  starting with this episode one,
*  we cover essentially all aspects of sleep
*  and provide numerous practical tools to improve your sleep.
*  For instance, we discuss the biology of sleep,
*  including the different sleep stages,
*  as well as why sleep is so important
*  for our mental and physical health.
*  We also talk about how sleep regulates things
*  like emotionality and learning and neuroplasticity,
*  that is your brain's ability to change
*  in response to experience.
*  And we discuss the various things that you can do
*  to improve your sleep, everything from how to time lighting,
*  temperature, exercise, eating, and the various things
*  that can impact sleep, both positively and negatively,
*  such as alcohol, cannabis, and various supplements and drugs
*  that have been shown to improve sleep.
*  We also talk about naps, dreaming and the role of dreams,
*  and lucid dreaming, which is when you dream
*  and you are aware that you are dreaming.
*  In today's episode one, we specifically focus on
*  why sleep is so important and what happens
*  when we do not get enough sleep or enough quality sleep.
*  We also talk about the various sleep stages,
*  and we also talk about a very specific formula
*  that everyone should know for themselves called QQRT,
*  which is an acronym that stands for quality, quantity,
*  regularity, and timing of sleep.
*  Four factors which today you'll learn how to identify
*  specifically for you what your optimal QQRT is,
*  and then to apply that in order to get
*  the best possible night's sleep, which of course equates
*  to the best possible level of focus and alertness
*  throughout your days.
*  Both Dr. Walker and I are very excited to share the material
*  in this six episode series with all of you.
*  And as we march into today's episode one,
*  I'm sure it will both provide a ton of excellent
*  practical learning for all of you,
*  as well as spark many questions that are sure to be answered
*  in the subsequent episodes of this series.
*  Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
*  is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
*  It is, however, part of my desire and effort
*  to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
*  and science related tools to the general public.
*  In keeping with that theme,
*  I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
*  Our first sponsor is 8Sleep.
*  8Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling,
*  heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
*  Many times on this podcast, we discuss how in order to fall
*  and stay deeply asleep, your body temperature actually
*  needs to drop by about one to three degrees.
*  And in order to wake up feeling maximally refreshed
*  and energized, your body temperature needs to heat up
*  by about one to three degrees.
*  8Sleep makes it very easy to control the temperature
*  of your sleeping environment so that it's easy to fall
*  and stay asleep and wake up feeling refreshed.
*  I started sleeping on an 8Sleep mattress cover
*  several years ago, and it has completely
*  and positively transformed my sleep.
*  So much so that when I travel to hotels or Airbnbs,
*  I really miss my 8Sleep.
*  I've even shipped my 8Sleep out to hotels
*  that I've been staying in
*  because it improves my sleep that much.
*  If you'd like to try 8Sleep,
*  you can go to 8Sleep.com slash Huberman
*  to save $150 off their pod three cover.
*  8Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, UK,
*  select countries in the EU and Australia.
*  Again, that's 8Sleep.com slash Huberman.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by BetterHelp.
*  BetterHelp offers professional therapy
*  with a licensed therapist carried out online.
*  I've been doing therapy for well over 30 years.
*  Initially, I had to do therapy against my will,
*  but of course, I continue to do it voluntarily over time
*  because I really believe that doing regular therapy
*  with a quality therapist is one of the best things
*  that we can do for our mental health.
*  Indeed, for many people, it's as beneficial
*  as getting regular physical exercise.
*  The great thing about BetterHelp is that it makes it
*  very easy to find a therapist that's optimal for your needs.
*  And I think it's fair to say
*  that we can define a great therapist
*  as somebody with whom you have excellent rapport,
*  somebody with whom you can talk about
*  a variety of different issues
*  and who can provide you not just support, but also insight.
*  And with BetterHelp, they make it extremely convenient
*  so that it's matched to your schedule
*  and other aspects of your life.
*  If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
*  you can go to BetterHelp.com slash Huberman
*  to get 10% off your first month.
*  Again, that's BetterHelp.com slash Huberman.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
*  Element is an electrolyte drink
*  that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
*  That means plenty of the electrolytes,
*  magnesium, potassium, and sodium, and no sugar.
*  As I mentioned before on this podcast,
*  I'm a big fan of salt.
*  Now, I wanna be clear.
*  People who already consume a lot of salt
*  or who have high blood pressure
*  or who happen to consume a lot of processed foods
*  that typically contain salt
*  need to control their salt intake.
*  However, if you're somebody who eats pretty clean
*  and you're somebody who exercises
*  and you're drinking a lot of water,
*  there's a decent chance that you could benefit
*  from ingesting more electrolytes with your liquids.
*  The reason for that is that all the cells in our body
*  including the nerve cells, the neurons,
*  require the electrolytes in order to function properly.
*  So we don't just wanna be hydrated.
*  We want to be hydrated with proper electrolyte levels.
*  With Element, that's very easy to do.
*  What I do is when I wake up in the morning,
*  I consume about 16 to 32 ounces of water
*  and I'll dissolve a packet of Element in that water.
*  I'll also do the same when I exercise,
*  especially if it's on a hot day and I'm sweating a lot.
*  And sometimes I'll even have a third Element packet
*  dissolved in water if I'm exercising really hard
*  or sweating a lot, or if I just noticed
*  that I'm not consuming enough salt with my food.
*  If you'd like to try Element,
*  you can go to drinkelement, spelled lmnt.com slash Huberman
*  to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.
*  Again, that's drinkelementlmnt.com slash Huberman.
*  And now for my conversation with Dr. Matthew Walker.
*  Dr. Matt Walker, welcome.
*  Dr. Huberman, it's an absolute privilege
*  and a delight to be back.
*  That's right, you've been on here before, but I have.
*  During this episode in this series,
*  we are going to go a lot deeper.
*  By the way, you look very well rested.
*  Thank you very much.
*  I actually slept pretty well last night,
*  despite it being a foreign location.
*  Same time zone, that helps just astronomically.
*  Amazing.
*  Well, rather than ask you what a great night's sleep
*  is for you, because I'm pretty sure you're gonna tell us
*  that there's some individual differences
*  that people need to pay attention to
*  in terms of what is quote unquote optimal sleep.
*  Let's start off with the basics.
*  What is sleep?
*  So sleep, I think, in some ways you can define as,
*  at least in humans, and in fact in all mammalian species,
*  is broadly separated into two main types of sleep.
*  On the one hand, we have something
*  that many people will have heard of
*  called non-rapid eye movement sleep,
*  or non-REM sleep for short.
*  And non-REM sleep has been further subdivided
*  into four separate stages,
*  and they are unimaginatively called stages one through four,
*  increasing in their depth of sleep.
*  So stages three and four,
*  that's the really deep sleep that we can speak about.
*  And I should explain a little bit at some point
*  what happens during that state within the brain.
*  It's stunning, it's astonishing.
*  So you've got stages one and two, light non-REM sleep,
*  when you sort of look at your sleep trackers
*  and it has light non-REM, deep non-REM, and then REM.
*  Stages one and two, that's light non-REM.
*  Stages three and four, that's deep non-REM.
*  And that's non-REM encapsulated.
*  On the other hand, we have rapid eye movement sleep,
*  or REM sleep.
*  And it's named not after the popular Michael Stipe band
*  of the 1990s, but because of these bizarre
*  horizontal shuttling eye movements
*  that occur during this stage of sleep,
*  hence the rapid eye movements.
*  And REM sleep is the, depending on your definition,
*  and we'll probably come to this in later episodes,
*  it's the principle stage in which we dream.
*  But if your definition is quite loose,
*  which is any reported mental activity when I wake you up,
*  or when you wake up, then it turns out that we dream
*  in almost every stage of sleep.
*  But I'll describe REM sleep from here on in
*  as perhaps dream sleep, and I'll make that faux pas.
*  So you've got these two types of sleep,
*  non-REM and REM sleep.
*  They will then play out in this beautiful battle
*  for brain domination throughout the night.
*  And that cerebral war is going to be won and lost,
*  on average for the average adult, every 90 minutes.
*  And then it's going to be replayed every 90 minutes.
*  And that creates the standard cycling architecture of sleep.
*  So whoever is listening to this,
*  when your head hits the pillow tonight, what will happen?
*  You'll start to go down into the light stages of non-REM,
*  then you'll go down into the deeper stages of non-REM sleep,
*  and you'll stay there.
*  And after about 45, 50, 60 minutes,
*  you'll start to rise back up again, and then you'll pop up,
*  and you'll have a short REM sleep period.
*  And then back down you go again,
*  down into non-REM sleep and up into REM sleep.
*  And as I said, you cycle through that,
*  on average, about 90 minutes, but I'll come back to that.
*  What's interesting, however, is the ratio of non-REM to REM
*  within your 90 minute cycle is not stable.
*  And what I mean is, as you move across the night,
*  the domination of those two types of sleep
*  within the 90 minute cycle changes,
*  such that in the first half of the night,
*  the majority of those 90 minute cycles
*  are comprised of lots of deep non-REM sleep,
*  but very little REM sleep.
*  But as we push through to the second half of the night,
*  now that ratio balance, that seesaw balance, shifts over,
*  and instead we have much more rapid eye movement sleep
*  and very little deep sleep.
*  So when people think about, okay, I just go to sleep,
*  I lose consciousness, my brain is still,
*  firstly, nothing further from the truth could be the case
*  in terms of your sleep.
*  Second, your sleep has a very specific pattern
*  that has consequences to real life.
*  So let's say that you're someone who normally gives yourself
*  an eight hour sleep opportunity in bed.
*  But the next morning, based on what I've just told you,
*  you say, okay, well, I want to,
*  I'm gonna get a jumpstart on the day,
*  or I've got an early morning flight.
*  So I'm just going to come up with numbers here.
*  I'm not suggesting that this is the ideal sleep schedule
*  by any means, but just to make the numbers simple.
*  Let's say someone normally goes to bed at midnight
*  and wakes up at eight.
*  So there's that eight hour opportunity.
*  But today, they're gonna wake up at 6 a.m.,
*  rather than 8 a.m. to get this push on the day.
*  How much sleep have they lost?
*  Well, technically, they've lost two hours of their eight hour,
*  so they've lost 25%.
*  But that's not entirely true.
*  They may have lost 25% of their total sleep,
*  but because of the strange structure of deep sleep first
*  and then REM sleep later, they may have lost 60, 70,
*  maybe 80% of their REM sleep.
*  So I only make this point because understanding
*  how sleep is structured can have consequences.
*  I will come back to the 90 minutes though.
*  It's fascinating.
*  We've often, and some people probably have heard this before,
*  it's a 90 minute cycle.
*  Well, there's huge variability.
*  Some people can have a sleep cycle on average,
*  that's maybe 75 minutes, others 120 minutes.
*  Is it consistent with an individual?
*  It is relatively stable within an individual.
*  So I would say that the size of the difference
*  from one individual to the next is much bigger
*  than the size of the difference within an individual
*  from one night to the next to the next.
*  Not unlike a healthy menstrual cycle in a woman,
*  which can range from as short as 24 days to 31 days
*  and still be considered a healthy cycle that's regular.
*  But, and it will change across the lifespan of course,
*  but for a good number of years,
*  it's going to be pretty consistent within a given woman.
*  And yet between women, it can vary quite a bit.
*  Immensely.
*  And what's also interesting is that speaking about
*  some sex specific things, there are sex differences.
*  So on average, men, if you look at them,
*  will have a sleep cycle that's about 15 to 20 minutes
*  longer than women, which on a 90 minute average
*  is actually quite a lot.
*  And I bring this point up because you may have seen
*  some of those sort of claims or devices out there.
*  Well, firstly, probably on social media
*  and people send me these things and say, is this true?
*  Which is you really have to structure your wake up time
*  at these very distinct 90 minute on the clock
*  when the clock strikes the 90 minute midnight.
*  That's when you have to be waking up
*  and you should set your alarm.
*  Right, the rationale, you'll tell me
*  that it's wrong presumably, but the rationale
*  of those devices is that one would be better off waking up
*  at the end of a 90 minute cycle,
*  as opposed to in the middle of a 90 minute cycle,
*  even if it means getting less total sleep.
*  Because the argument is that waking up
*  at the end of a 90 minute cycle allows one
*  to be more alert upon waking.
*  Right, that there's something uniquely special
*  about the completion of a 90 minute cycle
*  that will have you ejected out of sleep feeling
*  like an energizer bunny, kind of,
*  that's some of the claims that they.
*  And if I were to ask you now, true or false?
*  False.
*  So sleep for as much as you possibly can sleep.
*  Don't terminate that sleep artificially
*  on the basis of anyone telling you
*  that there is this kind of DaVinci code magic 90 minutes.
*  That's unfortunately not true.
*  And I've been guilty of saying it's a 90 minute cycle
*  and repeating that.
*  So if I didn't know any better, I would believe that.
*  So I'm not trying to chastise anyone.
*  I'm just simply saying, be aware of that and don't worry,
*  don't stress about this unique 90 minute cycle.
*  And there's some products out there that say
*  they're going to time you on your 90 minute cycle
*  and wake you up.
*  I would probably stay a little bit clear of some of those.
*  What about going back to sleep?
*  You said to get as much sleep as possible.
*  If I get six hours of sleep and then wake up
*  and I feel like I could go back to sleep,
*  would I be better off going back to sleep
*  provided that my work schedule allows for that?
*  Or is it the case that after you've gotten
*  a certain amount of sleep,
*  that's a good idea to get up and go?
*  I would say that if you feel as though
*  there's still more sleep in you.
*  There is.
*  I love that this has become biographical instantly.
*  It's going to be a good episode when that happens.
*  I would say, hold tight, stay in bed
*  with an asterisk that I'll come back to
*  and see if you can get back to sleep.
*  And we can speak about different ways of helping you do that.
*  But the reason I put a slight asterisk there
*  is the following.
*  If you're then in bed for the next 45, 50 minutes
*  wide awake, the danger, and it doesn't happen to everyone,
*  but the danger is that you start to associate
*  this thing called your bed
*  with this thing called wakefulness and not sleep.
*  And one of the things that we do
*  in cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia
*  is we try to prevent you
*  from spending long periods of time awake.
*  And I would say it's probably about a 25 minute
*  rule of thumb, it's not a rule, it's a rule of thumb.
*  If after about 25 minutes, you just can't seem to catch it,
*  and this is happening frequently,
*  I would just be mindful of you then starting to build
*  a bonded association in your brain
*  that your bed is also the place of being awake.
*  The analogy would be, you would never sit
*  at the dinner table waiting to get hungry.
*  So why would you lie in bed waiting to get sleepy?
*  And the answer is that you shouldn't.
*  And so we need to break that association.
*  Now there's nothing stopping you, however,
*  from saying there's still sleep in me,
*  I know that there is.
*  So I'm just going to get out of bed,
*  go to a different room, I'm just going to read a book,
*  listen to a podcast, and then only when I feel sleepy,
*  I'm going to go back to bed
*  because my schedule allows for it.
*  That's the best way I would tell you
*  if you still think there's sleep there on the table,
*  to try and get it back.
*  That's immensely valuable,
*  knowing that there's sort of a conditioned place effect
*  of being awake in bed.
*  I must say, I get pretty good sleep most of the time.
*  There've been phases of life, including recently,
*  where sleep has been challenging,
*  and I notice as I head toward the bed
*  to go to sleep recently, the words in my mind
*  are here's the battleground.
*  Like it's going to be a night of going to sleep,
*  waking up, going to sleep, waking up.
*  We'll get to this business of continuity of sleep
*  a little bit later, so we don't have to go into that now.
*  I should also note, by the way,
*  that for some people, when I speak with them,
*  they will, and it's just because you mentioned it,
*  it's beautiful, they will be saying,
*  I'm so surprised because I am watching television,
*  and I'm falling asleep on the couch,
*  and then I get into bed, and I'm wide awake,
*  and I don't know why.
*  And that's because in part,
*  you've built this connection in your brain.
*  And when you go into the bedroom,
*  that's what we try to do
*  with cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia.
*  You spoke about it as a battleground,
*  that it's almost this adversarial thing,
*  which in some ways infers that at that point,
*  you feel as though your sleep controls you,
*  and it is a miserable feeling.
*  And gradually over time,
*  what we would do is work with someone,
*  and at that point now, you control your sleep,
*  your sleep doesn't control you,
*  and that is such a freedom when you get it.
*  But sorry, I interrupted you.
*  Oh no, I interrupted you, but thank you.
*  Yeah, I've prided myself my whole life
*  on being able to sleep anytime, anywhere.
*  I learned it from my bulldog Costello,
*  or maybe that's what brought us together,
*  because he certainly had that trait.
*  I'm so sad he's not here around anymore with us,
*  because I would have loved,
*  he feels like he is the best sleep ambassador.
*  If there's a post child for good sleep.
*  Well, he's here in spirit sleeping.
*  So this is interesting,
*  and I think it's important for people to hear,
*  if you can't fall asleep,
*  or if you wake up in the middle of the night,
*  and you can't fall back to sleep pretty quickly
*  after about 20 minutes or so,
*  probably best to get out of bed.
*  So these 90 minute-ish cycles
*  that include different types of sleep,
*  prompt me to ask, if you were to describe
*  the basic characteristics of each of those
*  four stages of sleep,
*  and especially the deeper stages,
*  three and four, and REM sleep,
*  not just at the level of rapid eye movements
*  during REM sleep,
*  but in terms of the types of dreams,
*  or the characteristics of bodily state,
*  maybe you just flesh out the physiology and neurochemistry,
*  and touch on the dream features
*  associated with each of these different stages of sleep.
*  This just gets so exciting to me,
*  and even now when I go into the lab,
*  or I look at sleep traces from my sleep center,
*  I'm still in awe, in bewildered awe of what the brain does.
*  So as we start to fall into those lighter stages of sleep,
*  once you get past stage one sleep,
*  which is sort of almost the shallows
*  where you're just wading out,
*  then you go into stage two sleep,
*  and one of the hallmarks of stage two non-REM sleep
*  are something called sleep spindles.
*  And the way that we measure sleep in a laboratory,
*  by the way, is that we place,
*  you look like a spaghetti monster.
*  You've got all of these electrodes on your head,
*  you've got things above your eyes,
*  and you've got things on your body.
*  And we're essentially measuring three main signals,
*  electrical brain activity, we're measuring muscle activity,
*  and we're measuring eye movement activity.
*  And I'll explain why those three things are necessary
*  for me to know, are you awake, are you in sleep,
*  and if you're in sleep, which stage of sleep you're in.
*  So going into that stage two non-REM sleep,
*  we've got these sleep spindles,
*  and at that point I'm looking at the electrical signals
*  from your brain, what we call the EEG,
*  or the electroencephalogram.
*  And these sleep spindles are these beautiful,
*  short, synchronous bursts of electrical activity,
*  and they last for about a second to two seconds,
*  maybe a little longer.
*  And they are bursting at what we call a frequency
*  of somewhere between 12 to 15 hertz.
*  And what that means is that these brain waves
*  are going up and down 12 to 15 times per second.
*  That's what our measure is, 12 to 15 hertz.
*  And then you go back, and your brain at that point
*  has started to slow down.
*  Now when we're awake, your brain wave activity
*  can be going up and down maybe 20, 30, 40 times per second.
*  It's very fast and frenetic,
*  it's actually very chaotic electrical brain activity.
*  But as we're going into these lighter stages of sleep,
*  then the brain starts to slow down.
*  And at that point in stage two non-REM,
*  it's maybe going up and down
*  just four to eight times per second.
*  So a huge deceleration in terms of brain wave activity.
*  But occasionally you'll get these,
*  so it's going, shh, shh, shh, shh,
*  and then brrr, you'll get these beautiful bursts
*  of these sleep spindles.
*  I actually did, I've never published it publicly,
*  or we did a project called the sonification of sleep.
*  And we took these electrical signals
*  and then we turned them into sound waves.
*  And you can actually hear this beautiful sort of,
*  this, it's almost this beautiful throbbing
*  of a slow down in your brain,
*  and then you'll hear these spindles.
*  Almost sounds like that beautiful,
*  delicious rolling R in Hindi, so brrr,
*  it's just wonderful.
*  I'm not sure I can do that R, how does it go?
*  Brrr, brrr.
*  Yeah, not too bad. Is that right?
*  Okay. Not too bad.
*  I mean, we're erring on the side of feline,
*  but that's okay, Andrew.
*  So, so coming back to, I'm so sorry.
*  Coming back to sleep, we've gone into light stage two
*  as I'm trying to desperately hold it together,
*  and we're going down into deeper non-REM sleep.
*  Now something spectacular happens,
*  and this is where I just almost lose it every time I see it.
*  The brain now goes back down,
*  and its speed of oscillation, of going up and down,
*  is maybe just one or two times per second.
*  It's incredibly slow.
*  And this is whole brain activity or localized activity?
*  So we'll come onto this.
*  At first, the way we would measure it
*  is just from these electrodes,
*  which are measuring hundreds of thousands
*  of brain cells underneath them.
*  So a good analogy would be,
*  let's say you're at a football stadium,
*  and it's Stanford playing Berkeley in American football,
*  and what we've got is a single microphone
*  dangling over the middle of the stadium,
*  and that microphone is picking up the summed voices
*  of the 60, 70,000 people underneath.
*  It's the same thing with when we place an electrode
*  on your head, you're measuring the summed activity
*  of hundreds of thousands of neurons underneath.
*  But we've now started to use maybe 100, 200 electrodes
*  on your head, and we can pick these up
*  in local territories of your brain.
*  But that beautiful, powerful, slow brain waves
*  that we're getting during deep non-REM stages three and four,
*  it's not just slow activity.
*  You would think, okay, that sounds like
*  the brain is dormant.
*  No, no, the brain at that point,
*  the size of the waves is almost quadruple,
*  maybe 10x the size of the brain waves when you are awake.
*  Why is that?
*  Meaning that the brain waves are going up and down
*  very slowly, but the size of them,
*  which is what we call the amplitude,
*  that is now huge, it's epic.
*  So think about it, you're on the beach,
*  and when you're awake, the waves are coming in
*  very, very quickly, but the small waves,
*  and they're coming in in a random fashion.
*  But deep, slow wave sleep are these kind of epic things
*  that would happen in Hawaii,
*  where you just get these 20, 30 foot waves,
*  and they're coming in very slowly,
*  but they are epically big.
*  That is deep, slow wave sleep.
*  And then what happens is riding on top
*  of those big, slow waves are these sleep spindles.
*  They just keep coming.
*  So according to the sort of the sleep sonification project,
*  what you would hear now, these slow waves would be
*  shh, shh, brrr, shh, shh, brrr.
*  That's the slow wave and the sleep spindle.
*  What is it that happens in your brain though,
*  to your question, to produce these slow waves?
*  Well, let's go back to the football stadium analogy.
*  There before the game, that's wakefulness.
*  Everyone is having a different conversation
*  in a different part of the stadium,
*  and you just get this kind of incoherent sort of blabber
*  that's going on.
*  That's wake.
*  Your brain is doing different things
*  at different sort of locations of the brain processing,
*  different information at different moments in time.
*  And that's the fast frenetic activity of wakefulness.
*  When you go into deep sleep,
*  all of a sudden for reasons
*  that we still don't quite understand,
*  hundreds of thousands of brain cells in your cortex
*  all decide to unite in their singular voice of firing,
*  and they all fire together,
*  and they all go silent together.
*  They all fire together, and they all go silent together.
*  And that's what's producing these huge, big, powerful waves.
*  So the analogy in the football stadium would be,
*  at this point now, and I'll come across to your university,
*  Stanford is winning, and the crowd is buoyant,
*  and all of a sudden the Stanford crowd is singing,
*  Berkeley sucks.
*  Berkeley sucks.
*  And they're all uniting.
*  The whole stadium cries out at the same time,
*  and then goes silent at the same time.
*  It's an epic display of coordinated neural activity
*  in a way that we don't see in any other brain state.
*  It's phenomenal.
*  It's just in awe.
*  You answered the question I was going to ask,
*  which is, does the pattern of brain activity
*  that you just described occur in similar or identical form
*  during any waking states?
*  And I think you just said the answer is no,
*  meaning, if I understand correctly,
*  this is a very, very specialized brain state,
*  unique to sleep, unique to a specific portion of sleep.
*  And that begs the question, what is it doing?
*  So it turns out that all of these stages
*  that we'll describe, different stages of sleep
*  do different things for your brain and your body
*  at different times of night.
*  And it's very understandable that people in the public
*  will come over to me and say,
*  how do I get more deep sleep,
*  or how do I get more REM sleep?
*  And my question back to them firstly is,
*  why do you want more REM sleep?
*  And they'll say, well, isn't that the good stuff?
*  And I will say, well, it turns out that they're all important.
*  You need all of them.
*  But we can come on to,
*  I'll speak about non-REM sleep functions first,
*  and then I can probably, I should unpack REM sleep
*  and then explain its functions.
*  But as an overview, what we know is that during deep sleep,
*  first you switch over in terms of your body's nervous system
*  to what we call the parasympathetic nervous system
*  that you've spoken about a lot before,
*  which is this kind of very quiescent, calming state
*  of your body's nervous system.
*  The sympathetic nervous system,
*  which is very poorly named,
*  because it's anything but sympathetic.
*  It's very aggravating and activating.
*  And when we're awake, that seems to be somewhat more dominant
*  depending on what state you're in.
*  But in sleep, especially in deep sleep,
*  you shift over into this very strong parasympathetic,
*  quiescent, calm state.
*  And that instigates together with other things.
*  And we've demonstrated, by the way,
*  that we published a paper probably about a year and a half ago
*  that these slow waves and these sleep spindles
*  and the coordination of them,
*  how well that they're coordinated,
*  seems to instigate a signal down into your body's
*  what we call the autonomic nervous system,
*  which carries both the sympathetic
*  and the sympathetic nervous system inside of it
*  and forces you over into a parasympathetic state.
*  So these brain waves,
*  one of the things that they seem to be doing
*  is transacting a message to your body's nervous system
*  to say, calm down, quiet down.
*  What then happens?
*  Firstly, what we see is your cardiovascular system
*  ramps down.
*  Deep sleep, you could argue,
*  is almost the very best form of blood pressure medication
*  that you could ever wish for.
*  It's beautiful.
*  Then something happens within your immune system.
*  We're starting to unpack this,
*  but we still don't quite know why.
*  These pulsing deep, slow brain waves
*  seem to be a trigger for instigating
*  two things for your immune system.
*  Firstly, it stimulates the restocking of the weaponry
*  in your immune arsenal
*  so that you wake up the next day
*  and you are a more robust immune individual.
*  So these are things like T cells, natural killer cells,
*  things of that sort. Correct.
*  All of that good stuff.
*  But what's also interesting,
*  and there's a more recent discovery,
*  it's not just that your body has put back
*  all of this armory in place and in fact amplified it,
*  but your body's sensitivity to those immune factors
*  has also increased.
*  So you've restocked the weaponry
*  and you've made your body more sensitive
*  to those immune signals.
*  And that's why we will see in probably later discussions,
*  your immune system can start to become
*  really markedly impaired
*  when you're not getting enough sleep.
*  So that's a second benefit of the deep sleep
*  brainwave patterns.
*  The third benefit that we've realized
*  is that it's very good at regulating
*  your metabolic system and specifically your ability
*  to control your blood sugar and your blood glucose.
*  And if we selectively deprive you of just deep sleep alone,
*  and we can do this now very cleverly,
*  it's not as though I see you going into deep sleep
*  and I go into your bedroom and I wake you up
*  and then you go back to sleep,
*  which is how we used to do it sort of 10 years ago.
*  Now we can use a very clever method
*  where we play auditory tones to your brain.
*  But they are of a level that will not wake you up.
*  It's what's called a sub-awakening threshold.
*  And we determine that.
*  And by playing those tones,
*  it forces the brain to resurface out of deep sleep.
*  So you will still sleep a total eight hours.
*  But I will have selectively excised just your deep sleep.
*  And when I do that, sure enough,
*  your blood sugar ability,
*  your ability to control your blood sugar, I should say,
*  is impaired really quite demonstrably.
*  And it's for at least two reasons.
*  The initial thing is that your pancreas,
*  when it sees this spike in blood sugar,
*  it normally releases something called insulin.
*  And that insulin is a trigger to your body
*  to say start absorbing the blood sugar
*  so we don't get this toxic
*  or we don't maintain this toxic spike in blood sugar.
*  Your pancreas, when you are under slept
*  and specifically when you're not getting enough deep sleep,
*  does not release the appropriate amount of insulin.
*  Worse still, what we found is that
*  selectively depriving you of deep sleep
*  means that what little insulin is released,
*  the cells in your body become less receptive
*  to that insulin.
*  So you're not releasing enough of this chemical
*  to say start absorbing blood sugar.
*  And the cells that are designed to do the,
*  they stick a straw out into your bloodstream
*  and they suck up the blood sugar,
*  they don't respond to the insulin anymore.
*  So on both sides of the blood sugar regulation equation,
*  you become impaired.
*  And then I can give you an example upstairs in the brain.
*  One of the things that we found and we'll discuss
*  is that deep sleep helps regulate your learning
*  and your memory functions.
*  It helps start to move memories around in your brain
*  and protect them and shift them from short term to long term.
*  Deep sleep, however, we've now discovered is critical
*  for de-risking your Alzheimer's trajectory.
*  It's during deep sleep when you have a cleansing system
*  in the brain that starts washing away the toxic proteins
*  that build up by way of wakefulness.
*  And two of those toxic components are something
*  that we call beta amyloid and tau protein,
*  which are fundamental ingredients
*  in the Alzheimer's disease brain equation.
*  So certainly I could then understand
*  based on that litany of things that I've just provided,
*  and those are only a few of what deep sleep is doing,
*  you could imagine that's the stuff that I want to get
*  and that's the thing that I need to optimize for.
*  Not true because there is REM sleep.
*  I'd like to take a brief break
*  and acknowledge our sponsor AG1.
*  AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
*  that also contains adaptogens and is designed
*  to meet all of your foundational nutritional needs.
*  By now, I'm sure you've all heard me say
*  that I've been taking AG1 since 2012.
*  And indeed that is true.
*  Now, of course, I do consume regular whole foods every day.
*  I strive to get those foods mostly from unprocessed
*  or minimally processed sources.
*  However, I do find it hard to get enough servings
*  of fruits and vegetables each day.
*  So with AG1, I ensure that I get enough
*  of the vitamins, minerals, prebiotic fiber
*  and other things typically found in fruits or vegetables.
*  And of course, I still make sure to eat fruits and vegetables
*  and in that way, provide a sort of insurance
*  that I'm getting enough of what I need.
*  In addition, the adaptogens and other micronutrients in AG1
*  really help buffer against stress
*  and ensure that the cells and organs and tissues of my body
*  are getting the things they need.
*  People often ask me that if they were gonna take
*  just one supplement, what that supplement should be
*  and I always answer AG1.
*  If you'd like to try AG1,
*  you can go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman
*  to claim a special offer.
*  You'll get five free travel packs
*  plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
*  Again, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman.
*  Before you talk about REM sleep,
*  what about stages one and two of sleep?
*  Are those just kind of the jog into the sprint
*  that is deep sleep stages three and four?
*  Or if I were to stage the question
*  I'm asking as an experiment,
*  say I'm an undergraduate or graduate student in your lab
*  and I say, can we do an experiment
*  where we selectively deprive people
*  of stage one and two sleep only?
*  And then of course the question becomes,
*  what do you put in there instead?
*  So there's a bunch of other experiments
*  that one would have to do,
*  but has that experiment ever been done?
*  And if so, what is the consequence
*  of being stage one, two deprived
*  as opposed to just deep sleep deprived?
*  So just as you already elegantly demonstrated
*  that stage one selective deprivation is very difficult
*  because it's a de novo thing you have to pass through
*  to get to the other stages of sleep.
*  Is stage one the stage of sleep
*  that I and other people have experienced many times
*  where you're falling asleep
*  and you start to have a dream perhaps
*  about walking or running and then you kick yourself awake?
*  That's right.
*  And I should have explained what happens to stage one.
*  I love, so as we're going into stage one,
*  obviously our eyelids are closed,
*  but one of the first signs that we know
*  as we're recording, I told you we're recording
*  the electrical activity on the head with these electrodes,
*  but I also said that we're measuring eye movement activity.
*  And as you're going into light stage one non-RAM,
*  for reasons that again, we have no idea why,
*  your eyeballs start to roll in their sockets
*  underneath your eyelids.
*  That change that we can start to see,
*  we call them slow rolling eye movements
*  and they are the hallmark of you entering sleep.
*  And if you are lucky enough to have a partner,
*  you can see this.
*  You can, as they're falling asleep,
*  you will see these bizarre, now granted, if they wake up,
*  usually the relationship is terminated very quickly
*  because the thing you're like, what are you doing?
*  This time I'm on a plane, if the person next to me is sleeping,
*  I'm gonna be the guy kind of like,
*  where are your mirror, yeah, no, don't do that.
*  I'm the only one who gets away with it
*  because I'm a card-carrying sleep scientist
*  and even then, yeah, American Airlines
*  sometimes takes on bridge.
*  But so you get these slow rolling eye movements
*  and the brain waves start to sort of slow down again,
*  but you mentioned something else
*  and they are called hypnagogic jerks.
*  And as we're going into this first stage of sleep,
*  I told you that the principle stage in which we dream
*  is rapid eye movement sleep.
*  That's not exactly true because everyone
*  has had this experience that just as you're drifting off,
*  you start to have these little mini dreams,
*  almost sort of diet or dreams light, LITE.
*  And you can almost wake yourself up
*  based on the fracture point of cognition.
*  What I mean is you're thinking,
*  okay, so tomorrow I've got to get to the studio,
*  I'm interviewing that desperately annoying
*  British guy, Matt Walker.
*  And then there was the elephant in the room
*  with the helicopter wings on its head.
*  And you almost just think it wakes you up
*  because you think, wait, wait, sorry, excuse me,
*  go back, rewind, what just happened?
*  That's the point at which you've transitioned over
*  into what we call the hypnagogic state
*  where you can have these hypnagogic dreams,
*  but you also get these jerks.
*  We don't fully understand what happens,
*  but what we do understand is that as you're going
*  into sleep, you start to lose different aspects
*  of your sensory perceptual apparatus,
*  not lose in the sense of where did they go
*  and I can't find them, but the processing of those.
*  Now, many will remain during sleep.
*  One of the things that starts to degrade
*  is what we call proprioception.
*  And you've spoken about this before,
*  which is knowing how your body is positioned in space.
*  So proprioception is fascinating.
*  As you're walking with a colleague
*  and you're crossing over a street,
*  have you ever had that feeling where you step off the curb
*  and you're chatting and all of a sudden
*  you have one of those really ugly wobbles
*  where you can, oh, and it's because you had calculated
*  non-consciously and computationally,
*  you understood where your foot was in space,
*  you understood the velocity force
*  with which it was descending down onto the road below you,
*  you had miscalculated the distance
*  and your brain had expected your foot to hit that road
*  at a certain time and it did not.
*  It sends an error signal back up your spinal cord
*  and that's where you get that, oh.
*  This happened to me just last weekend.
*  I was at the San Francisco Zoo
*  and periodically throughout the landscape
*  of the San Francisco Zoo,
*  they have these kind of squishy surfaces
*  that are seamless with the concrete around them.
*  I think this is so kids can play
*  on the various sculptures there
*  and if they fall, it's a little bit more forgiving.
*  So I was just walking across this thing,
*  talking to the person to my left
*  and I stepped on this now rather squishy surface
*  and all of a sudden I'm like,
*  well, I don't know how to walk across this thing.
*  And I'm like, you know,
*  I've been walking on a long period of my life
*  and I really had to pay attention.
*  And then transition back onto the concrete
*  and could stop thinking about it for a moment.
*  And you almost then have to stop the conversation
*  that you are having because it takes over
*  and you switch from non-conscious proprioceptive
*  and you switch over.
*  So the issue is that when you are lying there awake in bed,
*  you sense the mattress underneath you,
*  you sense the support,
*  you're getting all of that feedback signal
*  that I was telling you was absent
*  when you inappropriately calculated the distance
*  down onto the road.
*  All of that is in place
*  and your brain is saying everything's fine.
*  But as we're drifting off into sleep,
*  we start to lose that proprioceptive feedback.
*  Now, normally that loss of proprioceptive feedback
*  and sensation of what's going on and where my body is
*  is before the loss of consciousness.
*  And so you lose consciousness
*  and that's then thereafter
*  when the loss of proprioception happens
*  and you don't have this sort of mental freak out
*  of proprioceptive break glass in case of emergency.
*  But sometimes the speed with which those things happen
*  changes and you start to lose the proprioceptive sensation
*  before you fully lose consciousness.
*  And at that point, your body says,
*  oh my goodness, mattress has just disappeared
*  and I'm falling.
*  And that's where you can have these jugs.
*  That's our current best theory.
*  I know we're going to talk a lot about dreaming
*  in a later episode of this series,
*  but what you just told me forces me to ask at this moment,
*  whether or not in dreams where we sense we are flying
*  is that possible because of the absence of proprioception?
*  We're sort of, we're on the mattress
*  or on whatever surface we sleep on,
*  but according to the brain, we're suspended in space.
*  Is that right?
*  Yeah, so it's one possibility
*  as to why we have those experiences.
*  In some ways though, it does bring us onto REM sleep.
*  During REM sleep, and I'll explain what happens
*  in the brain, but what you're talking about
*  is something that is even more unique about REM sleep.
*  As we go into REM sleep, your brain paralyzes your body.
*  So you are physically locked
*  into the incarceration of your body.
*  Why would your brain do this?
*  It's what we call muscle atonia.
*  Now, I was telling you that we measure
*  your electrical brain activity
*  and we measure your eye movement activity,
*  but we also measure your muscle activity.
*  Why do we do that?
*  Well, as you're going into non-REM sleep,
*  that muscle tone decreases,
*  but there's still some muscle tone there.
*  But as you go into REM sleep, in fact,
*  just a few seconds before you enter REM sleep,
*  I already know you're going into REM sleep
*  because bang, you become completely absent of muscle tone.
*  And if I were to pick you up,
*  and I mean, I'm probably not gonna be able
*  to pick you up out of your bed
*  based on certain images I've seen on social media.
*  If I lift you up, you'd just be like a rag doll.
*  You would have no muscle tone whatsoever.
*  It's almost like those toys where it's like a donkey
*  that sits up and it's got a button underneath
*  and you press the button.
*  I love those.
*  And it just falls down.
*  I used to have those as a kid too.
*  Like the simple things that you and I had as children
*  that would fascinate us.
*  I still own a couple of these,
*  but yeah, I need to get a donkey one in any event.
*  I know what you're referring to.
*  So this muscle, as we call muscle atonia,
*  and I think in sort of medicine,
*  usually with an A before it means the absence of something.
*  So sort of if you have arrhythmia,
*  absence of normal arrhythmia.
*  Aphasia.
*  Aphasia, yeah, sort of, or,
*  and here it's atonia, absence of the tone in your muscles.
*  Why would the brain do this?
*  Well, the brain paralyzes your body
*  so your mind can dream safely.
*  You would imagine how quickly you could be popped out
*  of the gene pool if, just like you described,
*  you thought I can fly.
*  So you get up out of your bed and you go to the window
*  and you launch.
*  Probably not going to end well,
*  depending on what floor you're on.
*  So this absence of muscle tone,
*  this physical incarceration that we have,
*  is one of the things, by the way,
*  that defines REM sleep from when you are awake.
*  Because if all I was doing in my sleep lab
*  was recording your electrical brain activity,
*  and I was in the other room
*  and I was just looking at your brain waves,
*  as you go into REM sleep,
*  I would not be able to tell,
*  are you in REM sleep or are you awake?
*  Why?
*  Because the electrical brain activity
*  is so similar when you are in REM sleep,
*  relative to when you're awake.
*  And what that tells us is that REM sleep
*  is an incredibly active cerebral condition.
*  Your brain is just firing away.
*  In fact, some parts of your brain can be up to 30% more active
*  when you're in REM sleep than when you're awake.
*  Stunning, particularly emotional brain centers.
*  So it's a stunning state of paradox,
*  and that's the reason that we sometimes call it
*  paradoxical sleep.
*  Your body is completely immobilized, utterly inactive,
*  but your brain is fervent with its activity.
*  By the way, people should not worry
*  when I say that your muscles are shut down.
*  And what happens is that,
*  just before you go into REM sleep,
*  there's a bursting activity that will go up into your brain
*  to light up your cortex,
*  but there's another signal from the brain stem
*  that's sent down all the way down the spinal cord
*  to the alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord
*  that will essentially create this inhibition.
*  It's only your voluntary skeletal muscles,
*  meaning that your involuntary muscles,
*  things, for example, such as your respiration
*  that helps you breathe in your heart,
*  that's the reason that we survive
*  and live another day after sleep.
*  So don't worry about that too much.
*  With two exceptions, though,
*  there are two sets of voluntary muscles,
*  for reasons that we still don't know either,
*  that are spurred from the paralysis of REM sleep.
*  One of them is the extraocular muscles,
*  and that's the reason that when you go into REM sleep,
*  you can have these darting horizontal movements
*  back and forth.
*  Those should also have been paralyzed, but they're not.
*  And then oddly, there is a muscle
*  in the middle inner ear muscle
*  that does not undergo the paralysis,
*  and it will also twitch too, just like your eyes.
*  But I'm getting into the weeds.
*  So that's what's happening
*  in these different physiological states.
*  And to your question,
*  when you don't have any muscle tone whatsoever,
*  maybe that is in part the reason why, A,
*  you can start to have these dreams
*  of absent gravitational pull,
*  meaning you can start to fly.
*  It may also be the reason, by the way,
*  coming back to proprioception,
*  you can sometimes have that feeling of,
*  some people would describe,
*  my teeth are always falling out.
*  I always feel as though, it's a very common thing too,
*  where you feel the absence of clothing on your body,
*  and you say, I walked out, and I was going to this meeting,
*  and I realized I didn't have any pants on.
*  And you forget that proprioception is also about knowing
*  that your clothes are on you and sensing those clothes.
*  You and I can now direct our attention
*  and sense those clothes on us.
*  Is it also the case that when we talk about sleep,
*  we talk about falling asleep,
*  that the sense that one is falling back into their head
*  is related to the progressive loss of proprioception
*  in the early stages of sleep?
*  Yeah. Or is it just semantics?
*  No, I often think that that may have been
*  where that notion comes from.
*  Why would we not say that I am,
*  sometimes people say I'm drifting off into sleep,
*  or I'm about to enter sleep,
*  and we say I'm falling asleep.
*  Now, some of that may be that I'm falling into
*  a sort of a deeper and deeper state
*  of a brainwave activity pattern, maybe,
*  but I actually think you're right.
*  Now, we don't know ultimately the origin of it,
*  but I believe it's in part because people have this sense
*  of falling, hence falling asleep.
*  Along those lines, I've found that
*  if I sleep horizontally on a bed or sofa,
*  the sleep is far and away different
*  than if I fall asleep upright in a chair
*  or partially upright in a recliner.
*  Yeah.
*  For instance, on an airplane.
*  Now, there are a bunch of other things happening on airplanes,
*  bright lights, noises, et cetera,
*  so it's not a good experiment
*  to compare those two situations,
*  an airplane recliner versus in bed at night.
*  Too many variables, temperature especially,
*  but is there any evidence that one's bodily position
*  during sleep or the orientation of the feet
*  relative to the head, the angle elevated,
*  upward or downward, has any impact on the pattern
*  of different sleep stages or quality
*  or any other aspects of sleep?
*  There is a reason for it,
*  and we'll probably come onto this at some point
*  when we speak about different methods for sleep optimization
*  or the new wave of fascinating sleep enhancement tools
*  has to do with temperature, we think,
*  that for you to be able to fall asleep and stay asleep,
*  you have to drop your brain and body temperature
*  by just a little less than about one degree Celsius
*  or probably two, two and a half degrees Fahrenheit.
*  And that's the reason, by the way,
*  that you will always find it easier to fall asleep
*  in a room that's too cold than too hot
*  because the room that's too cold
*  is at least taking you in the right temperature direction
*  for good sleep, whereas the room that's too hot,
*  the opposite, it turns out that the body's ability
*  to dissipate heat, what we call thermoregulation here,
*  and thermoregulation in one direction,
*  which is the reduction in core body temperature,
*  is superior when you are lying down
*  versus when you are inclined
*  versus when you are standing up.
*  Really?
*  And in part, it has to do with the distribution of blood
*  throughout certain parts of the brain
*  in the distal versus proximal regions,
*  meaning sort of the regions that are closest
*  to the core of your body
*  versus the regions that are further away.
*  But your body's ability,
*  if we largely take most items of clothes off you
*  and then we measure the core body temperature
*  and the way that we do this, it's a delightful technique.
*  It's called a rectal probe, and it's neither pleasant,
*  necessarily for the installation
*  of the experiments of doing it,
*  and it's certainly not necessarily for the participant,
*  but putting that aside for a second,
*  we can measure your core body temperature
*  and we can measure using temperature sensors
*  all over your body exactly what's going on
*  with the blood flow, and we can measure
*  how the brain is starting to dissipate the heat,
*  because one of the principal ways
*  that we dissipate heat from our body
*  is by moving blood around the body.
*  When we bring blood into the core of our body,
*  we're trapping it in the core,
*  and our core body temperature increases.
*  When we push that blood out to the surface,
*  it goes to these thin sort of capillaries and vessels
*  on the surface of your skin,
*  and you start to dissipate that heat,
*  and you dissipate it more quickly,
*  so your core body temperature drops.
*  And the body's sort of vasoactive capacity
*  for distributing that blood,
*  and then releasing that trapped heat
*  from the core of the body is superior
*  when you are lying down,
*  and therefore your body temperature can drop more quickly,
*  which is one of the many reasons why it's not as easy
*  to fall asleep when you're sort of at a 45 degree angle,
*  and why the quality of your sleep won't be as good.
*  Now there are other reasons too, just as you mentioned,
*  but coming back to position,
*  I would say that there are maybe,
*  there's perhaps at least two pieces of evidence
*  that would recommend positional differences
*  or positional changes.
*  The first is very obvious.
*  If you are someone who is snoring,
*  and you have, certainly if you have untreated sleep apnea,
*  which is where you're not just snoring,
*  but you'll have an absence of breath,
*  that's what the word apnea means.
*  Here's another one with an A in front of it,
*  panea, sort of you know, you've heard of pneumonia,
*  and this is about breath,
*  and apnea is about an absence of that breath.
*  And with sleep apnea,
*  not only do you start to have an airway collapsing partially,
*  and that's where you get that flutter,
*  and that's the sound of the flutter that we're having,
*  but then at some point, you just hear silence.
*  At that point, the person has stopped breathing entirely,
*  and that's the absence of breath.
*  That is much more likely to happen
*  if you are sleeping on your back,
*  because when you're sleeping on your back,
*  your airway is giving way to gravity,
*  which is wanting to pull the airway down,
*  and close it and shut it off.
*  So one of the suggestions for people
*  who have snoring or sleep apnea
*  is trying as best you can to train yourself
*  out of sleeping on your back.
*  Now there's lots of gadgets out there
*  that you can do that.
*  The old school way that we used to do it,
*  sleep apnea is more common in men than it is in women,
*  but women still have it.
*  But if you had a male,
*  you would bring them into the clinic,
*  and you would say,
*  it's often males who perhaps are carrying excessive body weight,
*  and so they're of larger mass size.
*  You'd say, can you also bring a T-shirt of your wife,
*  and it has to be a T-shirt that has a pocket on the front?
*  And then we would ask them to,
*  were the T-shirt back to front,
*  so it's a very tight fitting T-shirt, it's back to front,
*  and then you took a tennis ball or a hockey ball
*  in the back pocket.
*  And as you're lying there in bed,
*  and you turn over onto your back,
*  you get this painful signal of the tennis ball
*  pushing you in the back, and it gradually, I know.
*  Who came up with this?
*  Was this Matt Walker's idea?
*  This is not me.
*  I am not the sleep.
*  It's clever.
*  Yeah, I should now be, on social media,
*  I should be changed to sort of like sleep torture
*  or rather than sleep diplomat.
*  So that's one recommendation.
*  Try to stay clear if you're asking me,
*  are there certain positions we should stay away from
*  in that circumstance?
*  Yes, it would be.
*  The other comes back to something I mentioned
*  during deep sleep.
*  When this cleansing system starts to kick into gear,
*  and you're in deep sleep,
*  you should be able to wake up in your brain
*  and wash away these toxins from the day.
*  What we've found, a little bit of evidence,
*  and we in the Royal Week,
*  because I, like you, my lab doesn't do animal research,
*  we only do human research,
*  but some animal researchers had discovered
*  that when animals will sleep with their head on the side,
*  the brain is superior than when the animal is sleeping
*  on its back or sleeping on its front.
*  And in fact, if you look, and you would love this project,
*  if you go into Google and you just search
*  for sleeping animals, look at the head position,
*  and I will guarantee you that many of them,
*  if they're naturalistic,
*  are animals with their head turned to the side.
*  Now, the cute ones, the funny ones,
*  are when a kitten is splayed out on its back
*  and its head is back.
*  That's how someone with sleep apnea
*  would sort of sleep on their back.
*  But that's very rare.
*  We almost never see that.
*  So it's very interesting.
*  And what they found was that when those heads
*  were in those sort of side positions,
*  the cleansing mechanism of the brain
*  was a little bit better.
*  It wasn't night or day.
*  It's not as though, oh my goodness, I'm a front sleeper,
*  and I'm not getting any brain cleansing
*  or I'm a back sleeper.
*  I'm not saying that.
*  There's no need to take it to the extreme.
*  But I don't think there's any good evidence yet in humans
*  that firstly, that's the case,
*  and nor is the strong enough evidence
*  to make any recommendations.
*  But I just bring it up because it's in the data
*  and it's starting to emerge that if you were to ask me
*  about sleeping position and are there any recommendations,
*  those are the two pieces of descriptive advice
*  I would give you.
*  They are not prescriptive pieces of advice.
*  You mentioned the relationship between temperature and sleep
*  and we're going to get into that in some degree of detail
*  a little bit later because it's so critical.
*  But prior to starting to record this episode,
*  we were talking a little bit about yawning.
*  And you told me something really, truly fascinating
*  about yawning, which was?
*  So there are at least four competing theories of yawning
*  that we have and I think there is probably
*  an emerging clear winner.
*  The first theory was that it was just tiredness,
*  that yawning is simply a sign of you being tired.
*  And it turns out that that's not true
*  because many people can yawn when they're bored
*  and they are not tired and they've been very well rested.
*  So that doesn't seem to be true.
*  The next one was one that seems to be very logical,
*  which is it's about trying to rebalance your blood gases
*  and specifically oxygen and carbon dioxide.
*  And you would think that perhaps when you yawn
*  with that sort of when you,
*  and you inhale a huge volume of oxygen,
*  what you're trying to do is pump back up the oxygen
*  in your bloodstream or when you sort of,
*  and the exhale, maybe it's about exhaling
*  more carbon dioxide.
*  Not unlike the physiological size that occurred
*  during sleep of a double inhale with a long exhale.
*  Correct.
*  Or that one can voluntarily generate
*  for anxiety management in wakeful states.
*  Exactly, yeah.
*  And so that was a theory that maybe you're trying
*  to balance these blood gases.
*  And there was some very clever experiments
*  where they took individuals
*  and they artificially increased their oxygen levels,
*  but more specifically,
*  they increased their carbon dioxide levels bidirectionally.
*  They tried to manipulate it and they asked,
*  did those individuals start to yawn more?
*  Because the idea would be if your blood oxygen
*  is coming down and your carbon dioxide is starting to rise,
*  if this theory is correct,
*  you should start yawning with greater frequency.
*  And there was no difference whatsoever.
*  That's probably also the reason that you don't see people
*  yawning on a treadmill or when they're going into more
*  of an oxygen debt and higher levels of carbon dioxide.
*  So that theory was knocked out.
*  The third theory was one of contagion.
*  And it's fascinating.
*  Yawning, like several other things,
*  has a contagious element to it.
*  So as the audience, unexpectedly,
*  they didn't know what you were going to say.
*  And before you said it, you said,
*  you told us something interesting about,
*  I guarantee you that there will be people listening right now
*  who said, oh, I just yawned in response
*  to Andrew Huberman yawning.
*  It is very contagious.
*  In part, it's the mirror neuron system.
*  And you obviously understand this in depth.
*  Your brain has this capacity to mirror the action states
*  of other individuals.
*  So a good example would be,
*  let's say I'm walking out the door now
*  and I'm closing the door with my hand.
*  And all of a sudden, I'm going to get my hand trapped.
*  And you on the other side of the room,
*  you are seeing my hand.
*  And as soon as I trap my hand and I yelp out in pain,
*  you almost hold your own hand.
*  Because why?
*  Why are you doing that?
*  It's not just because you're trying to be compassionate.
*  No, you have experienced some degree
*  of what I've just experienced.
*  How does it do that?
*  Because your brain has a system inside of it
*  that mirrors my action states.
*  And it's called a mirror system.
*  And you can imagine why it's very good
*  to understand the action and emotional states of others
*  for pro-social capacities and all of that good stuff.
*  And one of the things that can also happen
*  with this mirror neuron system is that it mimics yawning.
*  So when you yawn, my likelihood of yawning increases too
*  because my mirror neuron system is matching your yawn.
*  And what's interesting is that we know other species
*  also have a mirror neuron system.
*  And that means that when you yawn,
*  there is a statistically higher chance
*  that your dog will yawn and it's cross species.
*  So when your dog yawns,
*  there's a higher probability that you will yawn.
*  And we've got this data and it's very clear.
*  One of the other interesting theories though,
*  is that when species that are cooperative species,
*  for example, a pride of lions,
*  when one of those lions yawns,
*  firstly, many of the other lions will yawn
*  in a contagious fashion.
*  But then consequently, there is a collection of actions
*  that happen after that contagious yawn.
*  And so some people have suggested that the yawning
*  is a way to enact cooperative group behavior.
*  That's another theory.
*  The final theory, number four,
*  which I think has the best evidence for,
*  is not the gaseous exchange balancing
*  of carbon dioxide and oxygen.
*  But when you inhale oxygen from the outside,
*  it's usually cooler
*  than your core body and brain temperature.
*  And when we inhale,
*  there is a modest drop in brain temperature.
*  And when the brain temperature starts to rise,
*  that's when we see yawning frequency beginning to increase.
*  So next time you see someone yawn,
*  don't think, oh, they're bored,
*  or they didn't get enough sleep.
*  Go over to them, hug them and say,
*  I know your brain is getting warm.
*  It's okay.
*  And then at that point, the friendship will be terminated
*  because no one should be hugging each other
*  and saying, your brain is warm.
*  I'm so sorry.
*  But anyway, that aside,
*  I'm sorry I took us down that tributary
*  of my polluted stream of consciousness,
*  but that's yawning explained.
*  Those are the four theories.
*  And we don't have a definitive answer,
*  but I think the best one right now that will continue
*  is that it's about brain cooling.
*  That theory makes a lot of sense.
*  People tend to yawn when they get tired.
*  As you mentioned, people can yawn for other reasons as well.
*  If I'm yawning because I'm tired
*  and yawning is to cool off my brain that's too warm,
*  is that an attempt to put my brain to sleep
*  because we need to cool the brain
*  in order for it to go to sleep
*  or something else going on there also?
*  And this sort of merges with the previous question
*  about body position.
*  I've lectured in the university for well over a decade
*  as I know you have as well.
*  And occasionally, every once in a while,
*  there's one student, I'm just kidding,
*  there are several students,
*  especially if it's an afternoon class
*  or a very early morning class
*  that is falling asleep in their chair
*  and then their head, they kind of jolt awake.
*  And we all know that keeping the room a little bit cooler
*  sometimes helps to keep people awake
*  as opposed to a warm afternoon classroom.
*  But in some ways, what we're talking about here
*  violates what you were talking about earlier,
*  that it's easier to fall asleep in a cool environment
*  as opposed to a warm environment.
*  The brain needs to cool in order to fall asleep.
*  But then when we yawn,
*  it's in response to the brain being too warm.
*  And so I'm having a little bit of a hard time.
*  Square that circle for me, yeah.
*  Help me understand.
*  Square that circle, I like that.
*  Yeah, please square that circle for me, Matt.
*  So it turns out that for you
*  to drop your core body temperature,
*  the opposite has to happen,
*  which is that you have to warm up
*  to cool down, to fall asleep.
*  And I mean warm up in a very specific way.
*  You have to have the outer surface of your brain warm up.
*  You have to get blood to the surface of your skin.
*  And that surface is almost acts like a snake charmer,
*  that it draws the warm blood from the core
*  and it pushes it to the surface
*  and you radiate the heat out.
*  And as you radiate the heat out,
*  as I said, your core body temperature plummets.
*  So why would people be falling asleep
*  in an afternoon meeting
*  when it starts to get a little warm?
*  Well, in part it's because the warmth of the room
*  is starting to make the face a little bit more rosy.
*  It's drawing the blood out to the surface.
*  So what's happening, the core of your brain
*  and your body temperature are starting to drop.
*  And at that point, that's why you're going to start
*  to feel a little bit more sleepy.
*  That's reason one.
*  The second that you described is that afternoon,
*  you're in meetings around a table
*  and you start to get, as you said,
*  those wonderful head nuts and people listening,
*  you all know that where the head goes down
*  and snaps back up.
*  It's not that people are listening to good music
*  and sort of doing this head bobbing.
*  It's that they're falling prey to what we know
*  is a genetically hardwired pre-programmed drop
*  in your afternoon alertness.
*  It's called the postprandial dip in alertness.
*  And that infers that it's after some kind of a meal.
*  It turns out it's not really related to a meal.
*  People say, well, I had a heavy lunch.
*  I had sort of pasta at lunch
*  and I always feel sleepy afterwards.
*  Maybe in part, but if I remove it,
*  I prevent you from having lunch
*  and we've done these studies too,
*  your brain still shows this very reliable drop
*  in alertness somewhere between,
*  it's quite wide,
*  but somewhere between about one to 4 p.m. in the afternoon.
*  Yeah, for me, it's always between two and 3 p.m.
*  which is a time where-
*  As I'm resisting looking at my watch right now.
*  Yeah, we might be in that phase of the day.
*  I can always feel it.
*  And if I close my eyes for 10, 20 minutes,
*  I usually can fall asleep pretty quickly for a nap.
*  I know we'll talk about naps later,
*  but if I don't and I ride it out,
*  usually by about 3, 3.30, I'm fine.
*  Get that rise back up, don't you?
*  And it sort of swings back up.
*  And so that's in part the reason though,
*  explaining the yawning and that warm feeling of,
*  I'm in the meeting room, the boardroom meeting
*  and the blinds are open, the sun is coming through.
*  I've got the sun on my back.
*  I'm starting to get very warm,
*  but I'm starting to get really, really sleepy.
*  It's the collusion of two things.
*  It's that you're going into this higher frequency
*  sleep zone in the afternoon,
*  this postprandial drop in your brain alertness
*  and we can measure it.
*  It's very reliable.
*  You can see this dip in your brain electrical activity
*  and you're getting warm at the surface,
*  which brings blood to the surface,
*  releases that heat from the core,
*  it drops and boy, do you want to fall asleep.
*  I wanna take a brief break
*  and acknowledge our sponsor InsideTracker.
*  InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
*  that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
*  to help you better understand your body
*  and help you reach your health goals.
*  Now I've long been a believer
*  in getting regular blood work done.
*  For the simple reason,
*  the many of the factors that impact your immediate
*  and long-term health can only be analyzed
*  from a quality blood test.
*  The problem with a lot of blood tests out there, however,
*  is that you get information back about metabolic factors,
*  hormones, et cetera,
*  but you don't know what to do with that information.
*  With InsideTracker, they make it very easy
*  to understand your results
*  and they also point you to specific directives

*  I took us on a bit of a journey into some,
*  I don't want to call them sidebars,
*  but some specific features around sleep
*  and falling asleep, et cetera.
*  Let's get back to the different stages of sleep
*  and frame that under the question of what is great sleep?
*  What is mediocre sleep?
*  I think we all know what bad sleep is.
*  It's when you can't get sleep,
*  but I think there's a whole different category of bad sleep
*  that you're gonna tell us about,
*  which is sleep that we think is good,
*  but is actually not as good as we think it is.
*  I'm always the bearer of doom and gloom.
*  No, but also the deliver of powerful tools
*  to improve one's sleep and thereby wakeful state.
*  So along those lines, what is sleep for truly?
*  And what happens when we don't sleep well
*  is perhaps more intuitive to most people.
*  Oh, I feel cranky or I can't remember things
*  or I just kind of, stress seems to feel a little more intense.
*  The same amount of stress feels more intense.
*  And what is great sleep?
*  And this is, I think all under the umbrella of,
*  why do we sleep?
*  I mean, why do we spend a good third to,
*  or more of our life in this incredible state of mind
*  and body that we call sleep?
*  And it really is quite a stunning state of idiocy
*  when you consider it because when you're asleep,
*  you're not finding a mate, you're not reproducing,
*  you're not foraging for food,
*  you're not caring for your young,
*  and worse still, you are vulnerable to predation.
*  On any one of those grounds,
*  but especially all of them as a collective,
*  sleep should have been strongly selected against
*  in the course of evolution.
*  And in fact, one of the founding fathers
*  of sleep research, Alan Rexhafen,
*  once said that if sleep doesn't serve
*  an absolutely vital function,
*  it is the biggest mistake
*  the evolutionary process has ever made.
*  And now what we've learned through,
*  almost 10,000 plus research studies over the past,
*  certainly 70, 80 years now,
*  is that nature did not make a spectacular blunder
*  in creating this thing called sleep.
*  So maybe I can firstly address,
*  what is sleep doing and what happens
*  if we're not getting sufficient sleep?
*  And then the other question is, what is good sleep?
*  In terms of what sleep is doing
*  and why he was right in saying
*  that mother nature didn't make a blunder,
*  and it hasn't by the way,
*  because if you go back,
*  every species that we have carefully studied to date
*  seems to sleep.
*  And what that tells us, even very old,
*  evolutionary old, ancient earthworms seem to sleep.
*  They will have a period of what we call the thargicus,
*  which is where they seem to be inactive.
*  So I bring that point up because it means that sleep
*  appears to have evolved with life itself on this planet,
*  and then it has fought its way through heroically
*  every step along the evolutionary path.
*  And that by itself must tell us
*  that whatever sleep is doing,
*  it must be non-negotiably life support necessary.
*  In what ways is it life support necessary?
*  Well, we now know many of those.
*  First, when you're not getting sufficient sleep,
*  I can speak about your hormonal systems.
*  Let's say I take a group of really healthy young men,
*  and I limit them to four or five hours of sleep
*  for five nights.
*  They will have a level of testosterone,
*  which is similar to someone
*  who is probably 10 years older than them.
*  So a lack of sleep will age you within five days by a decade.
*  We also see equivalent impairments
*  in female reproductive health caused by a lack of sleep,
*  impairments in estrogen, in follicle stimulating hormone,
*  and also in luteinizing hormone.
*  What about the effects of a single night's
*  poor sleep on hormones?
*  And not to get too down in the details here,
*  but is it necessary to have four or five nights
*  of minimal sleep in a row
*  before you start to see these effects?
*  Or let's say somebody is getting good sleep
*  for three nights or four nights of the week,
*  but then the other three are kind of challenging
*  for whatever reason.
*  But does one see a graded effect,
*  a kind of intermediate reduction in sex-storied hormones
*  like testosterone, estrogen, follicle stimulation?
*  There is some degree of a dose-response curve,
*  but we haven't mapped it out with high,
*  so the way I would want to do it,
*  as a sleep scientist would say,
*  okay, I'm going to do this for one night,
*  and I'm going to thin slice you to seven hours,
*  six hours, five hours,
*  and then I'm going to do it for two nights,
*  and you're going to, again,
*  be in the six hours, seven hours, four hours.
*  And I would like to build up this high fidelity map
*  and understand that we don't have that,
*  but certainly what we know is that a night
*  of total deprivation will markedly impair those hormones,
*  and we know that after about a working week of short sleep,
*  you see those impairments too.
*  But let me come back to one night,
*  so that's the hormonal system as an example,
*  and we've already spoken, or I'll come back to it right now,
*  the metabolic system and another hormone, insulin.
*  What we found is that if I take you again,
*  and I limit your, and you're perfectly normal, healthy,
*  you don't have any signs of type two diabetes,
*  and I limit you to, let's say, five hours of sleep
*  for four nights, and then I measure your ability
*  to dispose of blood sugar,
*  your level of blood sugar impairment is so disrupted
*  that at that point, your doctor would classify you
*  as being pre-diabetic.
*  So I could take an individual,
*  and within five nights of short sleep,
*  I can move them towards a path
*  that's getting very close to type two diabetes.
*  And as I said, we've understood, and we, royal we,
*  and whenever I say we, by the way, it usually means that,
*  well, whenever I say I did something,
*  I mean at my center, we did something,
*  and when I say we did something,
*  I mean that they did something.
*  That's a fair shorthand for attribution.
*  And so there have been studies that have re-decomposed
*  exactly how that impairment in blood sugar happens,
*  and we mentioned that earlier in this episode.
*  I can also then move on to, for example,
*  your immune system, this is a very good demonstration.
*  Firstly, there's a great study done by Michael Erwin
*  and his colleagues at UCLA, and he took individuals,
*  healthy individuals, and he limited them
*  to just four hours of sleep for one single night.
*  And he measured levels of critical
*  anti-cancer-fighting immune cells called natural killer cells.
*  And what he found is that after that one night
*  of just four hours of sleep, there was a 70% reduction
*  in natural killer cell activity.
*  That is a striking state of immune deficiency.
*  And just to give people a reference point,
*  these natural killer cells, think of them almost
*  like the Secret Service agents of your immune system.
*  These natural killer cells, they are very good
*  at identifying dangerous, unwanted elements
*  in your body like cancer, and going after them
*  and destroying them.
*  So you wish for a very virile set of these immune assassins
*  in your body at all times, and if you're not getting
*  sufficient sleep, that may not necessarily be the case.
*  We also know that if you are not getting sufficient sleep
*  in the week before you get your flu shot,
*  and this is just another example of how sleep is critical
*  for your immune system, if you're not getting that sleep
*  in the week before you get your flu shot,
*  you produce less than 50% of the normal antibody response,
*  therefore rendering that flu shot largely ineffective
*  in terms of vaccinating you.
*  We also know that if you're not getting sufficient sleep
*  on average, let's say that you're getting less
*  than six hours of sleep or less on average,
*  you're almost three times more likely to develop
*  the common cold, the common flu, and I know that you,
*  at the time of us recording this, you've released
*  some fantastic content about the flu
*  and the rhinovirus in particular.
*  So that's a good demonstration of your immune system.
*  We also know that it's not just that,
*  it's also your cardiovascular system that suffers
*  when you're not getting sufficient sleep.
*  And here again, the data I think is very strong,
*  cardiovascular disease writ large,
*  including stroke and heart attack.
*  And there is one study that I think illustrates this
*  and granted now in terms of the replication,
*  the effect sizes may not be as big,
*  but this study was interesting.
*  They didn't do something radical like depriving you
*  of sleep for an entire night, nor did they just limit you
*  to five hours of sleep for four nights.
*  There is a global experiment, sleep experiment,
*  that has performed on about 1.65 billion people
*  across 70 countries twice a year.
*  And it's called daylight savings time.
*  Now in the spring, when we lose an hour of sleep,
*  what they observed in that paper was a 24% relative increase
*  in heart attack risk the following day.
*  Yet in the autumn, in the fall,
*  when you gain an hour of sleep,
*  there was a 21% reduction.
*  Amazing.
*  So it's bidirectional.
*  And by the way, and I just said that paper,
*  there are some aspects that you can sort of discuss,
*  but it has been replicated.
*  We see increased rates of hospitalization
*  after that one hour of lost sleep in the spring.
*  There are higher rates of car accidents on the road
*  after one hour of lost sleep.
*  We also see higher rates of suicide
*  after one hour of lost sleep during the spring time change.
*  We even see this great data.
*  They looked at the sentencing of federal judges
*  in the United States.
*  And because it's the federal system, the government system,
*  all of those things are cataloged and well documented.
*  So you have a huge database.
*  And they went back.
*  And what they found is that in the spring,
*  when we all lose that one hour of sleep opportunity,
*  those judges doled out harsher federal sentencing
*  in the day after they had lost one hour of sleep
*  because their emotional and mood states were impaired.
*  And we'll speak about this in a later episode too.
*  So if you are up for sentencing,
*  or please try to avoid that spring time change
*  as best you can.
*  Go for the fall date if it's possible.
*  So that's your cardiovascular system.
*  I could also tell you that it goes all the way down
*  into the cellular and molecular state of your body.
*  And I'm trying to do this
*  to impress the fundamental importance of sleep.
*  There was a wonderful study done by my colleagues
*  at the University of Surrey back in the UK,
*  led by Dirk Yandike.
*  And what they demonstrated was that
*  if you take healthy individuals,
*  and everyone is going to act as their own control,
*  and you limit them to six hours of sleep for one week
*  versus allowing them to sleep at least eight and a half hours
*  or more time in bed.
*  And then what they did was they measured the change
*  in their gene activity profile
*  relative to when those same individuals, as I said,
*  were getting a full eight hour plus opportunity in bed
*  versus the six hours of limited sleep.
*  And they found two interesting things.
*  First, sizable and significant 711 genes were distorted
*  in their activity caused by lack of sleep.
*  By the way, that's relevant.
*  We know that almost one out of every three,
*  maybe even one out of every two, if you look at the data,
*  people that pass you on the street is trying to survive
*  on six hours of sleep or less during the week.
*  So it's a relevant ecological manipulation.
*  The second result was that about half of those genes
*  were increased in their activity.
*  The other half were decreased.
*  Now those genes that were impaired by way of one week
*  of short sleep were genes associated with the immune system.
*  So once again, you can see this immune deficiency
*  but now playing out at a genetic level.
*  Those genes that were increased or what we call overexpressed
*  were genes that were associated
*  with the promotion of tumors,
*  genes that were associated
*  with long-term chronic inflammation within the body,
*  and genes that were associated with cellular stress
*  and as a consequence, cardiovascular disease.
*  And to me, that study impressed the fact
*  that there is no aspect of your wellness
*  that seems to be able to retreat at the sign of sleep deprivation
*  and get away unscathed.
*  It's almost like a broken water pipe in your home.
*  That sleep will leak down into every knuck and cranny
*  of your physiology and it will even tamper
*  with the very DNA nucleic alphabet
*  that spells out your daily health narrative.
*  So I paint this picture which seems dire
*  and I think someone once said to me,
*  look, your TED talk, which I think was called
*  Sleep Is Your Superpower, they said that talk
*  should have actually been sleep or else dot dot dot.
*  Which was a completely fur thing
*  because I think very early on as a public figure for sleeper,
*  I did a terrible job, I was very dictatorial.
*  Oh, I disagree.
*  Well, I think I was very absolutist
*  and I've learned my lesson.
*  I disagree and I'm going to interrupt intentionally,
*  not to puff you up just because,
*  but I think that it's fair to say,
*  I know it's fair to say that the cautionary notes
*  that you spoke about in those early TED talks
*  and in your book, Why We Sleep,
*  while they may have stimulated some anxiety for some people,
*  they absolutely had and have a net positive effect
*  in the sense that they cued people
*  to the importance of this thing called sleep
*  because prior to you doing that or those things,
*  it was the case that it was the,
*  I'll sleep when I'm dead mentality.
*  And as somebody who's pulled many all-nighters
*  in his career, many, many, although not these days,
*  any longer, thank goodness, I can tell you
*  that that information was transformative for my behavior
*  and also for people in the arenas of military,
*  sports, children, adults.
*  I, it is fair to say that we have better parents,
*  better kids, better citizens of every country
*  as a consequence.
*  So I won't allow you, one of the few things
*  I will have a hard line on,
*  I won't allow you to malign your contribution.
*  And the good news is this series is also going to include
*  a lot of discussion about things that one can do,
*  anyone can do to improve their sleep.
*  So enough with that, Walker.
*  Thank you for saying that.
*  I will stop trying to reject that, but I would also just-
*  Folks, put in the comments on YouTube,
*  whether or not you agree with me or you agree with Matt
*  and then, you know, and thanks for agreeing with me.
*  I would say though that please don't start,
*  as you mentioned that getting anxious,
*  if you're not finding it easy to fall asleep,
*  that listening to me is firstly,
*  probably not going to make matters any better,
*  but don't think even if you're in the general public that,
*  look, I had one bad night of sleep,
*  does it mean I'm now going to develop Alzheimer's disease?
*  Absolutely not.
*  There's, we're not suggesting that,
*  we're talking about a model in which, you know,
*  week after week, month after month,
*  yes, I've demonstrated that, you know,
*  after just one night of something of short sleep,
*  you can see measurable impairments and we can,
*  and I can't, you know, I can't be untruthful
*  about the scientific data,
*  but it's not as catastrophic as one may think.
*  And as you said, in this series, we will also speak
*  and focus a great deal about what can you do
*  to start to try to optimize your sleep.
*  So thank you for that opportunity.
*  Absolutely.
*  So lots of things not good for us happen
*  when we don't sleep enough on a consistent basis.
*  Yes.
*  One poor night's sleep, let's face it,
*  I mean, our species would cease to exist
*  if that were the case.
*  Precisely.
*  Because all these parents that have stayed up,
*  you have an emergency or the neighbor's dog is barking,
*  or you go to an Airbnb where it's too warm
*  and you can't sleep.
*  I mean, but clearly bad things start to happen
*  when we are chronically sleep deprived.
*  We hear less often about the great things that happen
*  when we get great sleep.
*  Perhaps we can talk about a few of those.
*  I mean, obviously, many of them are going to be
*  just the inverse of what you just described.
*  But for instance, learning, neuroplasticity,
*  the nervous system's ability to change
*  in response to experience.
*  Sleep deprivation impairs learning, yes.
*  Yeah.
*  And a great night's sleep makes it a lot easier to learn.
*  Right?
*  So what are the data in terms of the relationship
*  between sleep and learning?
*  Again, something we're going to go into
*  in quite a bit more detail, but can you give us a,
*  can you throw us a bone about some of that?
*  Can you incentivize us for getting good sleep,
*  not just through fear, but we heard the sticks,
*  throw us a carrot.
*  Yeah, so there are so many wonderful carrots.
*  So when you are sleeping, your brain's capacity
*  in its learning centers are so much more
*  ready to absorb information.
*  So think about these memory centers in the brain,
*  almost like a dry sponge if you've been sleeping well.
*  And they are so excited to soak up new information
*  and retain that information.
*  So firstly, sleep before learning
*  is going to help you acquire and imprint new memories
*  very effectively.
*  And we've demonstrated that,
*  and I'll tell you about the studies in a later episode.
*  We also know that sleep after learning
*  does something delicious.
*  It will take those freshly minted memories
*  and it will consolidate them into the brain,
*  meaning that it will start to fixate them,
*  almost like sort of setting them in concrete into the brain.
*  And so you are far less likely to lose those memories,
*  which is to say you are far less likely to forget
*  if you've been sleeping after you've learned.
*  It's not just that though.
*  Sleep does more than simply strengthen
*  those individual memories.
*  Sleep will start to cross-link
*  and connect those memories together.
*  And as a consequence, the next day you will wake up
*  and that memory back catalog has now been updated
*  with all of the recent information,
*  and it's integrated and it's associated.
*  So you are now able to come up with new creative solutions
*  to issues or problems that you've been facing
*  because you've updated what we call
*  the associative networks in your brain.
*  And this is the reason that people will describe
*  having had these insights by way of sleep
*  and these problem-solving capacities.
*  And really that's what, to me,
*  a good student is not simply a student
*  who can learn all of the individual rote facts
*  and then just regurgitate them.
*  An individual memory is not as sitting as an isolate island,
*  is not particularly useful.
*  That's why your laptop isn't, well,
*  as long as it's not connected to the internet now
*  and OpenAI, it's not particularly intelligent.
*  I mean, it has a storage capacity
*  that is almost more perfect than your brain.
*  It doesn't make some of the memory mistakes that we do.
*  The reason it's not as intelligent as we are in part
*  is because it has not integrated the information.
*  It doesn't link all of the, wouldn't it be wonderful
*  if you woke up one day and you'd installed a program
*  on your computer and your computer just understood
*  how all of the files were interrelated and connected
*  and it was saying, okay, you've double-clicked
*  on this file, well, now I'm going to tell you
*  that there is this related information.
*  You should pull this in here
*  and it would enhance this paragraph that you're working on
*  or it would improve this experimental idea
*  that you're coming, it doesn't do that,
*  but your brain does that.
*  How does it do that?
*  In part, it's because sleep is building
*  these associative networks.
*  So it's not simply the student who learns the rote facts.
*  It's the student who learns the facts
*  and then understands what they mean.
*  Sleep is not just about learning
*  and it's not just about knowledge.
*  It's about wisdom, which is knowing what it all means
*  when you fit it together.
*  And that's one of the other roles of sleep.
*  So those are some of the beneficial things,
*  the sort of the carrots that can come by way
*  for your learning and memory.
*  There are so many other carrots though.
*  We described for your immune system
*  how there is this restoration that happens
*  during deep sleep and it primes that.
*  But there are other benefits too.
*  One of the things that we've discovered
*  and we hopefully will get to discuss this in more detail
*  is that sleep provides almost a rebooting
*  of your emotional and your mood states.
*  And as a consequence, you wake up the next day
*  and you are dressed with a very different set
*  of emotional clothing.
*  And sleep when you're getting it,
*  almost it's like a set of emotional windscreen wipers
*  that it's just cleared those things off and you wake up.
*  It's the reason that people will tell you,
*  if something is troubling you, don't worry.
*  Just come back tomorrow.
*  Just give it a night of sleep
*  and you'll probably feel better tomorrow.
*  That feeling better notion is sleep acting
*  as this emotional balm that just soothes
*  that those jagged edges that we've,
*  be sort of almost like a CD getting scratched
*  if anyone out there knows what a CD is these days.
*  But these scratches that we get, emotional wounds,
*  sleep is starting to heal those as well.
*  So those are benefits.
*  I could also mention some other aspects
*  of your weight control and your weight gain.
*  And this is a huge, huge effect size.
*  Sleep moves the needle on almost every aspect
*  of brain and body health.
*  I think it's very clear at this stage
*  that there is no single tissue
*  or major physiological system in your body
*  and no operation of your mind
*  that isn't wonderfully enhanced by sleep when you get it
*  or demonstrably impaired when you don't get enough.
*  But when it comes to appetite and regulation of weight gain,
*  this is immense.
*  Firstly, what we know is that
*  when you're getting sufficient sleep,
*  you can create a nice concentration ratio
*  of two appetite regulating hormones
*  called leptin and ghrelin.
*  And let me go sort of in the reverse
*  to probably give you a better example.
*  Let me say I deprive you of sleep.
*  And what we see is that these two hormones that,
*  and I joke, they sometimes sound like,
*  leptin and ghrelin sound like hobbits
*  from Lord of the Rings, but they're not.
*  They're real hormones.
*  And leptin essentially is the signal
*  that tells your brain,
*  okay, you're satiated by your food.
*  You're full and you don't want to eat more.
*  So hunger and appetite decrease.
*  Ghrelin does the opposite.
*  When ghrelin increases,
*  now it's the signal of hunger
*  and you get increasingly unsatisfied
*  despite eating a full meal.
*  If you've got still high levels of ghrelin,
*  you don't feel satisfied with that meal.
*  And many people listening may start to say,
*  I have this feeling where I'm just eating
*  and I just don't feel satisfied on some days.
*  And those days, I suspect can be days
*  when you are not sleeping well.
*  And I think everyone has had this feeling of saying,
*  I just didn't sleep well last night
*  and I just get ravenous
*  and I just unleashed this unholy hunger and appetite.
*  That's in part because these two hormones.
*  So what happens is that when we're not getting
*  sufficient sleep, leptin, the signal that says,
*  you're satisfied with food, stop eating,
*  that is impaired by way of lack of sleep.
*  If that wasn't bad enough,
*  the hormone ghrelin that says,
*  no, you're not satisfied with your food, eat more,
*  that's the signal of hunger, that increases.
*  So it's almost like double jeopardy.
*  You're getting punished twice for the same crime
*  of not sleeping.
*  Once by way of a drop in leptin, stop eating.
*  And once by way of ghrelin, foot to the floor acceleration,
*  I want to start eating.
*  That's in part why your waistline can start to expand
*  when you're not getting sufficient sleep.
*  But when you do, it's a fantastic way of controlling,
*  I guarantee you, if you start to implement better sleep,
*  your ability to regulate your basal levels
*  of appetite and hunger will decline.
*  But it's not just that you want to eat less,
*  or you at least want to eat an appropriate amount
*  for your body mass.
*  It's also what you want to eat.
*  And what we've discovered is that when you are,
*  again, not getting sufficient sleep,
*  you start to eat more, yes, you do,
*  but you eat more of specific things.
*  You crave things like these heavy hitting,
*  sort of stodgy carbohydrates, like bread and pasta
*  and potatoes and pizza.
*  And also you crave simple sugars.
*  And so those foods we know in excess can be
*  what we call obesogenic foods.
*  They are foods that can lead you
*  to a more rapid amount of weight gain.
*  Whereas when you are getting sufficient sleep,
*  now you're reaching at the food bar for,
*  you're saying, well, actually I think the salad
*  and those healthy nuts and the fruits,
*  and those things look quite appetizing today.
*  Versus when you are under slept,
*  all you want to do is go after the junk food,
*  and because you kind of got these munchies.
*  What's interesting is that a recent discovery
*  came back to that notion of the munchies.
*  When I say I got the munchies,
*  people sometimes think of a drug reference,
*  they'll say, well, I've been smoking weed,
*  I always get the munchies.
*  Why is that?
*  Because when you are bringing in cannabis into the body
*  and these cannabinoids,
*  these what we call exogenous cannabinoids,
*  they will increase your appetite.
*  They will stimulate your appetite.
*  Cannabinoids are appetite stimulating components.
*  But we all have our own version of cannabinoids
*  that we produce inside of our body
*  that you've spoken about before called endocannabinoids.
*  When you are under slept,
*  the brain releases more endocannabinoids,
*  and that's in part why you get this strong impulse.
*  And thus ago, when you start sleeping better,
*  you moderate all of these hormones and these chemicals,
*  and your appetite is controlled.
*  When you eat, you feel satisfied with your food,
*  you're not craving more.
*  When you make your food choices,
*  you're making better food choices.
*  We did a study with brain imaging
*  where we under slept individuals,
*  and we had them see food items inside of a brain scanner,
*  and they had to rate how much do I desire
*  and how much do I want these items.
*  And those items range from very healthy items
*  all the way to unhealthy items.
*  Things like ice cream and sort of beets
*  and all of that good stuff and sweets,
*  candy, as you would say over here.
*  And we looked at their ratings.
*  And by the way, to make this a more ecological,
*  because you could say, well,
*  they're gonna know what's the healthy choice,
*  so they're probably just gonna be politically correct
*  and say, oh, I desire the healthy food.
*  Because the way that we tried to get around that was,
*  we said, anything that you said was desirable,
*  when you come outside of the scanner,
*  we've actually got all of these foods,
*  and you're gonna have to eat them.
*  So they were making more realistics.
*  And each person went through the experiment twice,
*  one night after a full night of sleep,
*  one night with significantly less sleep.
*  And sure enough, inside of the scanner,
*  they were rating unhealthier foods as more desirable.
*  So your preference was going in that unhealthy direction.
*  But what was interesting was what was going on in the brain.
*  We saw that the frontal lobe regions,
*  these sort of areas that sit above our eyes
*  that almost act like the CEO of the brain,
*  and they help regulate our deep emotional centers,
*  those regions of the brain had gone offline
*  by way of a lack of sleep.
*  And these emotional centers that are usually associated
*  with more hedonic reward,
*  and they're also excessively more active
*  in people with obesity,
*  who have what we call hedonic eating patterns,
*  those regions were ramped up by way of a lack of sleep.
*  So it's not just that there are chemical changes
*  in your body that conspire to have you eat more.
*  There are also changes in your brain
*  that prevent you from making the healthy food choices.
*  But when you're getting sufficient sleep
*  in the control condition, when they were getting that sleep,
*  their brain was beautifully regulating
*  the optimal food choices.
*  So that's just another example of a carrot,
*  no pun intended now, that when you're getting sleep,
*  if one of the ways you want to manage your body composition
*  and manage your appetite is by way of getting
*  sufficient sleep, it's actually a very powerful tool
*  that we probably underate.
*  And then this other aspect I would say
*  is emotional and mental wellness.
*  Everyone knows that your emotional and mood states
*  will take a nosedive like a dart into the ground
*  when you're not getting sufficient sleep.
*  It's that idea of I just snapped, dot, dot, dot.
*  And those are the words that usually are uttered
*  by people who are not usually sleeping very well.
*  But when you're getting good sleep,
*  it's so much easier to regulate and manage those emotions.
*  And Michael Grandner, great sleep researcher,
*  he did an interesting study, and it was one of those studies,
*  many studies I read from my colleagues,
*  that my initial reaction to the study was jealousy
*  because it was such a good study and I was jealous
*  that I didn't think of the idea.
*  And now gradually with my senior age,
*  I've disabused myself of that ego and very quickly,
*  I then think this is the best paper
*  and I can't wait to tweet it out.
*  But he did a great study and it was only quite recently,
*  he asked, what are the reasons
*  that people want to try to improve sleep?
*  You would have thought that we'd have known this,
*  decades ago.
*  And it's a relevant question to the point that you're asking,
*  which is about these carrots.
*  I know that there is still probably some degree
*  of a sleep loss epidemic out there in the world.
*  There is still that sleep machismo mentality
*  that I can sleep when I'm dead.
*  So how can we try to motivate people?
*  Well, I can do it with the stick
*  and I can do the whole sort of, you know,
*  if it bleeds, it leads and do the doomsday stuff
*  and that can motivate.
*  But why don't I try to understand what it would be
*  for most people that would have them try to enact
*  better sleep behaviors?
*  And they asked all sorts of different options.
*  And the two things at the end of the paper,
*  when they did all the statistics that stood out,
*  like two sore thumbs,
*  I want to try to improve my sleep
*  because I want to improve my mood.
*  I want to improve my sleep
*  because I want to improve my body weight.
*  People know it.
*  They already knew it.
*  We didn't have to show them the data.
*  And so it's just interesting.
*  So I'm just bringing those two things up
*  as carrot examples.
*  There are many others, of course, too.
*  Terrific examples of carrots that one can get
*  if they get adequate sleep.
*  And we'll talk about quality and some other features
*  of sleep that are important in just a moment.
*  But I'm curious, how come when we are sleep deprived,
*  we get bags under our eyes and our skin health shows it?
*  Like even one day, if you know someone well
*  and you see them regularly and they walk in
*  and they look particularly well rested,
*  we think they're bright eyed and bushy tailed, so to speak.
*  But you can often see it in their skin and in their eyes,
*  how glassy their eyes are, how open their eyes are.
*  But also the bags under their eyes.
*  And of course, folks, never say to somebody,
*  you look tired.
*  The other way to do it is just if they look particularly
*  well rested on a given day, say, you look well rested.
*  Actually, I told you that today.
*  You did, you were very kind to us.
*  That's right, I forgot about that, but now I remember.
*  And it's true, you look very well rested
*  being the sleep guy and all.
*  Why do we show our lack of sleep in our skin so rapidly?
*  It's almost like a thermometer on how much sleep
*  somebody got the night before.
*  It's stunning, isn't it?
*  And you can almost see it.
*  You know, if you have a partner and they come through
*  to the sort of kitchen in the morning and they look at you
*  and because you're so familiar with that face,
*  because it's a face that has imprinted on you
*  thousands of times, you can notice subtle changes.
*  And you can sometimes sense, you know, they do look tired,
*  but you're absolutely right.
*  You don't say that, you just say, you know,
*  how are you this morning?
*  And is there anything I can do for you?
*  Should I make you a coffee?
*  Maybe you should go back to sleep.
*  Yeah, yeah, I think that's the politically correct,
*  indirect way of saying, boy, do you look tired.
*  Two things on that front.
*  The first, it comes back to the immune system.
*  That sort of pale parlor in a face,
*  almost that sickly looking skin,
*  in part is because you're already seeing the effects
*  of the immune system.
*  And it's the same with the bags under the eyes.
*  That part of this reboot of the human being,
*  you know, that human beings seem to have
*  what I would describe as a recycle rate.
*  And it seems to be about 16 hours.
*  That after about 16 hours of wakefulness,
*  we need about an eight hour-ish,
*  and it's seven to nine hours is the recommendation.
*  Don't get hung up on it.
*  And we'll speak about exactly that in a second.
*  But that seems to be required to reset
*  this whole panoply of health and physiology
*  of a human being.
*  One of the things is the immune system,
*  and you get this sickly look about individuals,
*  and you get the bags under the eyes.
*  So that in part explains it.
*  There was a great study done by a colleague of mine,
*  Tina Sundalen, and working out in Sweden
*  at the Karolinska.
*  And this again was one of those studies
*  that I just thought was so genius.
*  And it was a two-part study.
*  They firstly took individuals
*  and they sleep deprived them for a night,
*  or they allowed them to sleep well.
*  In fact, they went through both of those.
*  And after a full night of sleep,
*  or after a night of sleep deprivation,
*  they went into a studio and they had their picture taken.
*  They had a portrait shot done
*  under identical lighting conditions.
*  So now for every participant in the study,
*  you've got two headshots,
*  one of when they were sleep deprived,
*  one when they were sleep rested.
*  Great.
*  Now came the second part of the experiment.
*  They then took all of those kind of headshots
*  and they recruited a new set of participants
*  who acted as an independent set of judges.
*  And those judges knew nothing
*  about the experimental conditions
*  and the manipulations that had just happened.
*  They were simply shown these images
*  and they were asked to rate
*  how attractive does this person look,
*  how healthy does this person look,
*  and how tired does this person look.
*  And again, they knew nothing about what was going on.
*  Sure enough, with very high statistical probability,
*  when the headshot that was taken when they were under slept,
*  they rated that individual as looking less attractive,
*  as looking more sickly in terms of their appearance,
*  and also looking more tired.
*  So first they had proven this thing called beauty sleep,
*  that you look a more attractive version of you
*  when you're getting sufficient sleep.
*  But they also noticed this sickliness,
*  sort of composition to someone's face.
*  So that's a very long way of explaining the bags under the eyes.
*  I'm sorry, I go off on these tangents, Andrew.
*  Not a tangent at all.
*  I asked, you answered, and here we are.
*  Okay, so you've been explaining
*  the different dimensions of sleep,
*  the underlying physiology,
*  some of the psychological and physiological consequences
*  of getting not enough sleep, enough sleep, et cetera.
*  I think a question that everybody is asking themselves is,
*  A, how much sleep should they get?
*  And B, what is really great sleep?
*  And then of course, there are all these other parameters of sleep,
*  leaving aside whether or not one sleeps a little bit reclined
*  or on their side, et cetera.
*  How should we think about this activity that you're calling sleep?
*  How should we break it down?
*  What are the variables that we need to think about
*  in terms of being able to ask ourselves
*  how well or poorly we're doing,
*  and for lack of a better way to put it, to optimize our sleep?
*  So I think, to me, the question of what is good sleep,
*  at first it seems to be obvious.
*  You can come through, again, to your partner in the morning,
*  and they'll say, how did you sleep?
*  And you have an answer.
*  Yeah, I slept well, or I don't think I did sleep well.
*  So we all have some subjective sense.
*  But science, for the most part, science and medicine,
*  has usually used a singular rubric,
*  which I think is reasonable, which is quantity.
*  So you would hear that, OK, how much sleep do we need,
*  and what would that look like to be good sleep?
*  And the answer is it's a quantitative answer,
*  somewhere between seven to nine hours.
*  Well, actually, I would answer it differently.
*  If someone said, how much sleep does an average person need,
*  I would say about 90 minutes more.
*  If you look at the...
*  That's the answer you would give everybody.
*  Yeah, how much sleep do I need?
*  And I would say probably about 90 minutes more.
*  If you look at the average data.
*  But setting that...
*  90.
*  90 more.
*  If you look at, based on the epidemiological studies
*  of how much people actually are getting.
*  But that metric of quantity is the way that most of us,
*  and I've been certainly party to this as well,
*  have answered the question as, what is enough sleep,
*  or what would be a good amount of sleep?
*  And good amounts of sleep would be somewhere between seven to nine.
*  And that's the current recommendation.
*  That's the recommendation by many health organizations,
*  including here in the US, which is the CDC.
*  They recommend or they stipulate a minimum of seven hours
*  for the average adult.
*  To me, however, that doesn't capture the true complexity
*  that sleep really is.
*  And it is, as we've now discussed in the episode,
*  a wonderfully complex ballet of physiology.
*  And so I've stepped back and I really tried to think,
*  to me, what are the main components that would constitute
*  this recipe for good sleep?
*  And I've conceptualized what I would describe
*  as the four macros of sleep.
*  That there are, you know, when we think of diet,
*  we've got three macros, fat, protein, and carbohydrate.
*  For me, sleep actually has four macros.
*  And you can remember this by the acronym QQRT.
*  And it stands for quantity, quality, regularity,
*  and timing.
*  QQRT, quantity, quality, regularity, and timing.
*  And maybe I can just go into detail because I'm telling you,
*  you know, these are the rules for good sleep.
*  No one responds to rules.
*  They respond to reasons and not rules.
*  So let me explain the reasons behind each one of these.
*  So quantity we've already spoken about,
*  somewhere between seven to nine for the average adult.
*  Let me move on to quality.
*  We measure quality in a variety of different ways.
*  The first principle quality measure of sleep is continuity.
*  So meaning, was your sleep nice and continuous
*  and you didn't wake up many times?
*  Or was your sleep fragmented and littered
*  with many awakenings?
*  It was punctuated by these awakenings.
*  If it's very highly fragmented,
*  that's what we call poor quality of sleep.
*  That's low efficiency of sleep.
*  So maybe you would be in bed for, let's say, nine hours
*  and you still got seven hours of sleep.
*  So if all you used was your quantity measure,
*  you would say, well, you've still had good sleep.
*  You've had seven hours.
*  But two of those hours have been spent awake, summed total.
*  So that is very low quality of sleep.
*  And it's what we would call a low score of efficiency.
*  So if you're looking at any of your sleep trackers,
*  that's probably best captured by sleep efficiency.
*  What is sleep efficiency?
*  Sleep efficiency is simply calculated as,
*  of the total amount of time in bed,
*  what percent of that time were you asleep?
*  So if I was in bed for eight hours and I slept for six hours,
*  I would have a sleep efficiency of 75%
*  because two out of the eight hours, 25% of that time,
*  I was awake.
*  And an efficiency that is 85% or above,
*  we typically classify as healthy sleep.
*  And we would like to see you there
*  or perhaps a little bit higher.
*  If you have a lower sleep efficiency score than that,
*  it usually means that you're awake too much of the time
*  and we'll think about that and address that.
*  So that's one measure of the second Q of the QQRT.
*  That's quality.
*  But there's another measure that we can also use.
*  That measure comes back to the deep sleep that we spoke about
*  and particularly the electrical quality of those brain waves.
*  So you can have deep sleep and it
*  can be of different qualities, electrical qualities.
*  You can have deep sleep that is immensely powerful
*  with huge epic waves.
*  Or you can have deep sleep that still is classified
*  as deep sleep, but it's a little bit more sort of anemic
*  in its quality.
*  And you can't really measure that with these sleep trackers.
*  We have to use electrodes and then we
*  decompose the electrical brain activity
*  using a fancy equation.
*  And that tells us what was the amount of sort
*  of strength of activity, what we call electrical power,
*  in that deep sleep regiment.
*  So that's another measure that we use for quality.
*  Next is regularity.
*  And actually, I should come back to quality.
*  For a long time in sleep science,
*  we were using quantity as our major metric
*  for predictability, meaning I look at your quality
*  and does it predict your learning or your memory?
*  I look at your quantity and does it predict
*  your blood sugar regulation?
*  I look at your quantity, does it predict your immune health?
*  I look at your quantity and does it predict
*  your mortality risk?
*  And the answer has been yes, that quantity
*  does predict many of those things.
*  That's great.
*  What was interesting is that if you
*  look at the statistic of the predictability of quantity
*  alone, it was strong, it was significant,
*  but it still left a lot of unexplained
*  what we call variance.
*  So it must be that there are some other things in sleep
*  that are explaining these health metrics in addition
*  to quantity.
*  And quality has now come online, I think,
*  in the past 10 years as carrying as much, if not perhaps even
*  more in certain domains of a predictive strength
*  in determining your mental and your physical health
*  that quantity has.
*  And it at least forced me in my own research
*  to, A, always be measuring quality in as high resolution
*  as I can and always including it into a statistical model.
*  And we can do fancy things where we put those two things,
*  pit them head to head, and see which one actually
*  holds more of the statistical weight.
*  But certainly quality sleep is as important,
*  I would say now, at least as important
*  as the quantity of sleep.
*  Now, you can't shortchange on either.
*  You can't say, OK, did he just tell me
*  that I should not worry about how long I'm sleeping?
*  So you can't just get four hours of sleep
*  that is incredibly good quality and get away with it.
*  But you also can't be in bed for nine hours or 10 hours
*  getting seven hours of sleep.
*  But it's really bad quality of sleep.
*  You have to get both.
*  You can't shortchange either one of those.
*  So at that point, you think, well,
*  isn't that the end of the story?
*  The QQ, why do you need this R and T of QQRT?
*  The regularity has come online, I would say,
*  in the past 18 months as being a relevant metric.
*  When I say, you would say, well, hang on a second.
*  Regularity and timing, they sound like the same.
*  When I say regularity, I mean when you go to bed
*  and when you wake up.
*  If you keep that consistent, that
*  is the third piece of the four macros.
*  That's regularity.
*  I go to bed at the same time.
*  I wake up at the same time.
*  Plus or minus how much?
*  So I would say plus or minus 30 minutes.
*  That's your wiggle room.
*  You don't want to try.
*  And everyone, even I, I'm fairly puritanical about my sleep,
*  not because I want to be some poster child
*  and practice what I preach.
*  It's simply that if you knew everything I did about sleep,
*  it's an entirely selfish act to prioritize my sleep.
*  I don't want to die any sooner than I have to.
*  And I don't want to live with disease any longer.
*  And the greatest health insurance policy
*  that I know of that is universally available,
*  largely free, and mostly painless,
*  is this thing called a night of sleep.
*  So I'll gift it to myself every single night.
*  I don't see it as selfish because, of course,
*  when we are ill or dead, there is a burden on others.
*  It can be an absence burden or a presence burden,
*  depending on what and how people feel.
*  Please look at me when you say presence.
*  People feel about us, but that's interesting.
*  Now, when you say same wake up time, same to sleep time,
*  plus or minus 30 minutes for each of those,
*  is that plus or minus 30 minutes getting into bed?
*  Or are we talking about falling asleep,
*  entering that first stage one?
*  It's really from the time of light out.
*  So OK, I've been in bed.
*  And I got into bed at the same time.
*  But last night, I went to sleep about an hour later.
*  And then the night before, I got into bed.
*  I just turned the lights out.
*  And then two nights ago, I got into bed again
*  at the same time.
*  But then I was kind of online shopping,
*  and I started chatting with a friend in a different time zone.
*  And then it was 2 and 1 half hours later before lights out.
*  That is what we would classify as irregular sleep.
*  And the reason that this has really
*  been forced on me is important.
*  There was a great study that came out maybe,
*  I'll get this wrong, from about five months
*  from the time of filming this ago.
*  And it used a huge database.
*  It's something called the UK Biobank,
*  which is a wonderful database.
*  And they looked at over 60,000 individuals.
*  And they looked.
*  They were able to track the sleep from one night
*  to the next, to the next, to the next.
*  So they had some metric of this consistency, this regularity.
*  And then they split those 60,000 individuals into quartiles.
*  And in their statistical model, they
*  looked at people who were most regular versus people
*  who were least regular.
*  And they tracked them over years.
*  What they found, and then they looked at their mortality risk.
*  How likely was it that those people would pass away
*  during that study interval?
*  And they were also able to map what were they
*  dying of if they passed away.
*  So what they found was that those people who
*  are in the top quartile of being most regular,
*  relative to those people who are highly irregular,
*  if you had good regular sleep, you
*  had a 49% reduced risk of mortality
*  relative to someone who is very irregular.
*  Of that general all-cause mortality risk,
*  when you split it apart, there was a 35% decrease in cancer
*  mortality, specifically.
*  And there was almost a 60% de-risking
*  of cardiovascular mortality risk if you
*  are regular versus irregular.
*  Then they did this brilliant thing.
*  Because they were measuring both the quantity of sleep
*  and when these individuals were sleeping,
*  they did what I just said, which is they put them
*  into a statistical model.
*  Sure enough, the quantity of sleep,
*  just as we've shown time and time again,
*  was very predictive of all-cause mortality.
*  Using that sweet spot of seven to nine hours.
*  And we can speak about what happens when you start
*  to sleep longer, because it's actually very unpredicted.
*  It's very interesting.
*  But sweet spot of seven to nine, the shorter your sleep,
*  the shorter your life.
*  That's what the data seems to suggest.
*  But what they found was that that was true,
*  yet regularity or irregular sleep carried almost twice
*  the effect size, the magnitude of predictability
*  that duration did.
*  And I think the whole field, we knew that regularity,
*  I knew that regularity was important.
*  I don't think we understood how important
*  and the strength of mortality de-risking
*  if you're regular or increased risk if you're irregular,
*  that this metric of R carried in the QQRT equation.
*  So I've started to be much more mindful myself, at least,
*  and almost over-index that.
*  The final aspect comes on to timing.
*  And I should say that we've used this, essentially,
*  this kind of equation, this sleep algorithm, as it were,
*  of QQRT now in a lot of my work in the past at the Sleep Center
*  in the past four or five years.
*  And it does seem to be a pretty good proxy of covering,
*  predictive-wise, many aspects of your health.
*  That if you use any one of these by themselves,
*  they help, they predict things.
*  But if you use them as a collective,
*  that seems to be where you explain most of the variance.
*  Now, it's not by far a perfect measure.
*  There are even more nuanced ways that you would want
*  to split it and I want to split it.
*  But I would say that this is a pretty good proxy
*  for the general public.
*  And it seems to be, in our research,
*  a pretty good proxy for health and wellness, too.
*  The final aspect of the QQRT, quantity, quality,
*  regularity, comes on to timing.
*  How is timing different to regularity?
*  Because regularity is about getting your sleep
*  at the same correct time.
*  What I mean by timing is your chronotype.
*  So people may have heard of this phrase,
*  are you a morning type, evening type,
*  or somewhere in between?
*  That, it turns out, is, and it's about a third, third split
*  across the population, maybe a little bit different.
*  Does it divide up any differently
*  according to male, female?
*  And here, presumably we're not talking about children
*  or teenagers, that's a whole other business
*  and we'll talk about that.
*  Yeah, so once you are an adult,
*  and because that pattern of your timing of sleep
*  does change during development, very much so,
*  despite, you know, we can all remember being kids
*  and wanting to stay up with the grownups.
*  And all of a sudden, the last thing we remember was,
*  you know, seven o'clock comes around,
*  eight o'clock comes around and you think, great,
*  we're gonna stay up until 10 or 11 with them.
*  And then you wake up the next morning
*  because you were carried to bed because it was lights out.
*  So setting that aside, once you're an adult
*  and you have your stable rhythm in place,
*  it, there is variability.
*  Now in sleep science, we break it down,
*  not into three categories, but five,
*  extreme morning type, morning type, and neutral,
*  evening type, extreme evening type.
*  Could you repeat those again?
*  So extreme morning.
*  Extreme morning type.
*  So what qualifies as extreme morning type?
*  An extreme morning type would,
*  someone who would like to say go to bed around 8 p.m.
*  and then they would be, you know, waking up
*  and they wake up very easily around four,
*  4.30 a.m. in the morning and they're bright as a bunny.
*  They are ready to get to the gym and I'm in neutral.
*  I just sit right in the middle.
*  So I'm kind of an 11 to 7.30 kind of guy.
*  Okay, maybe we could walk through this.
*  So the extreme morning type is to bed.
*  But let's say around eight and they could be,
*  they could wake up at let's say four, 4.30
*  and they would be fine.
*  A morning type, maybe they would like to go to bed
*  around 9.30 and then they're waking up closer
*  to sort of 5.36.
*  Then you've got a neutral like me
*  and I would like to go to bed probably around 11 p.m.
*  and wake up around sort of 7.30-ish.
*  I try to give myself about an eight
*  and a half hour time period in bed.
*  And then you get to the night owls.
*  So then you've got the evening type
*  and then the extreme evening type,
*  which finishes out the full five.
*  The evening type, maybe they would like to go to bed
*  12.31 and probably wake up around maybe 9, 9.30.
*  And then you've got the extreme evening type
*  and they are not ready for bed until maybe 2.30, 3.00 a.m.
*  and they're waking up middle of the morning.
*  So what's interesting about your chronotype,
*  and by the way, people, if you want to find out
*  your chronotype, if you want an actionable suggestion,
*  you can just go online and you can search
*  for something called, just type in chronotype MEQ.
*  And that stands for the morningness,
*  eveningness questioner MEQ.
*  Just type in chronotype MEQ
*  and you will see you can fill it out.
*  It takes three, four minutes, series of questions
*  and it will give you back a score
*  and that will then bucket you into these different flavors
*  and sort of say, okay.
*  I've tried all of these.
*  And you can go to the next question.
*  I've tried all of these.
*  Okay.
*  And I hate to admit it, but if I had my preference,
*  I would go to sleep at 8.30 and wake up at 4.30 or so.
*  Well, let me ask you this question
*  because rather than doing the MEQ,
*  there's a single question I normally ask and say,
*  okay, Andrew, I now put you on a desert island.
*  Alone?
*  Alone, you've got nothing to wake up for,
*  no electricity, no responsibilities, no nothing.
*  What time do you think your body
*  would like to go to sleep and wake up?
*  And I say that specifically because if I ask you,
*  what time would you like to,
*  you're still biased in your head
*  by all of the trappings of society
*  and this terrible bias towards morning types.
*  Do you think that naturally,
*  that's probably the regiment that you would do?
*  Yeah, great question.
*  I would go to sleep sometime between 90 and 120 minutes
*  after sundown.
*  Yeah, okay.
*  So that's why I was going to answer,
*  I'm either an extreme morning type or a morning type.
*  I can go to bed around 9.30, wake up at five feeling great
*  or go to sleep early, 8.00, 8.30, wake up at four
*  and really wanna get up and write and exercise.
*  Now, that's not the schedule I follow.
*  I may start to follow that schedule.
*  I've tried for various portions of my life,
*  but typically I end up defaulting
*  to go into sleep a bit later, 10, 10.30,
*  waking up around six, six, 30.
*  And that's assuming that there are no events in my life
*  that are disrupting my sleep
*  because then I'm really going to sleep in if I can
*  and a bunch of things to try and compensate.
*  But assuming everything is cool in life
*  and in the room that I sleep.
*  That's the spirit there you go.
*  I would say going to sleep at nine
*  and waking up at about 4.35 a.m.
*  when it feels great.
*  And in fact, I always thought of it
*  as a bit of an anti-depressant feel.
*  I don't consider myself somebody who's depressed,
*  but I can get a little low level malaise
*  if I'm staying up till 11, 30, 12
*  and even waking up at seven.
*  I don't feel quite right.
*  And when I go to bed early and wake up early,
*  I feel really, really good.
*  You do. All day long.
*  And what's interesting about that is it works both ways.
*  So that malaise that you're speaking about
*  also happens for evening types
*  who are forced to be morning types.
*  Unsympathetic.
*  No, I'm kidding.
*  Just kidding.
*  Society is, we are desperately biased
*  towards the morning types.
*  And we chastise and stigmatize evening types
*  as being slothful or lazy.
*  That they just can't get it together.
*  Why can't you be at the gym at six a.m.
*  and in the office by nine 30?
*  What's wrong with you?
*  Or seven 30. What's wrong with you?
*  Well, I'm chuckling because I was weaned in academia
*  and the late Ben Barris, who was my postdoc advisor
*  and then later a colleague that unfortunately
*  he passed away in 2017.
*  But he used to say, I don't do mornings.
*  Now he was our department chair at the time,
*  but he would just say, I don't do mornings.
*  But he would come in around 11 a.m. or noon,
*  but he would stay until three in the morning.
*  And I feel like there's been a cultural shift.
*  I feel like 10 years ago,
*  if you were the person who stayed late
*  at the office or the lab,
*  you were considered a hard worker.
*  But getting in early at that time,
*  it seems was not as rewarded.
*  Nowadays, maybe something's just changed in my world,
*  but I feel like the person who gets in first
*  kind of gets the prize in terms of
*  the psychological credential.
*  Yeah, there is that reward bias that's given.
*  It's this notion, the early bird catches the worm.
*  So I think we were desperately unkind.
*  Society is engineered towards morning types.
*  It's engineered against evening types.
*  The reason that that's not fair is that this,
*  and I'll come back to timing again and how it works
*  and why it's important and the fourth ingredient,
*  the fourth macro.
*  But coming to chronotype,
*  the reason it's unfair is that it's not your fault.
*  That your chronotype is largely genetically dictated.
*  And we now understand that there are at least
*  22 different genes which augment your chronotype,
*  which determine your chronotype.
*  In other words, it is gifted to you at birth,
*  it's hardwired, and it is not your fault.
*  Yet we still have this stigma and this,
*  I think, disgraceful, not only under appreciation,
*  but almost this kind of wry evening types are
*  of a certain kind, not very favorably viewed.
*  So think about it this way.
*  You would never, let's think about another trait,
*  eye color that is genetically determined.
*  And you were to look at me and you would say,
*  he's got blue eyes.
*  It's just, you're kind of lazy because you've got blue eyes.
*  Oh, you've got green eyes?
*  Gosh, that's wonderful.
*  Well done, congratulations.
*  Wait a second, it's not, I didn't get the choice.
*  It's genetics.
*  What's the same with your chronotype?
*  But coming back to why for me I included it
*  in this sort of algorithm of what is good sleep.
*  If I were to take an extreme morning type
*  and force them to stay awake until midnight,
*  they're going to be incredibly tired.
*  They're going to be so tired
*  and they're gonna be grumpy and miserable,
*  and they will have no problem falling asleep.
*  The problem, however, is that they're still going to,
*  because of their natural chronotype,
*  which determines your circadian rhythm.
*  So everyone has this 24-hour circadian rhythm.
*  As you've been a wonderful proponent of that
*  and done incredible work in this area.
*  We all have this 24-hour rhythm
*  and it looks like a sinusoidal wave.
*  It sort of goes up and we, as a diurnal species,
*  we're active and awake during the day.
*  And then you get this awesome downswing at night
*  and we're inactive at night.
*  And it steps and repeats.
*  It's just a 24-hour cycle.
*  Everyone has that.
*  So why doesn't everyone fit the same chronotype
*  timing model of sleep if we all have a 24-hour clock?
*  Well, what's different is that where that peak
*  and that trough sit on the 24-hour clock face
*  varies from one individual to the next,
*  and that is what we call chronotype.
*  So this comes back to why it's important.
*  The morning type, they are in their awesome downswing
*  of their circadian rhythm at midnight
*  and they are miserable.
*  They're desperate for sleep.
*  And when you put them into bed at midnight,
*  four hours later than they would otherwise, they are gone.
*  The problem is their circadian rhythm now starts
*  to climb back up around 4.30 in the morning.
*  And even though they went to bed at midnight,
*  they're probably going to wake up artificially
*  before the eight-hour or seven to nine-hour completion,
*  and they're going to be short slept
*  on the back end of sleep.
*  Yeah, this happens to me many, many times.
*  I want to go to bed around 8.30 or nine,
*  but for social or work reasons,
*  I stay up until 11.30 or 12.
*  I fall asleep very easily.
*  Yep.
*  I almost always have fallen asleep easily.
*  And then 3.30, four in the morning, I'm awake.
*  And you cannot get, it's almost as though,
*  you know, I was telling you, okay.
*  I tend to do this yoga nidra, non-sleep deep rest,
*  and sometimes I can fall back asleep that way,
*  but oftentimes it's a struggle.
*  And it's a struggle because of your chronotype
*  and your circadian rhythm,
*  which is on its wonderful piston upswing now.
*  Apologies for the motorsport reference, but I'm obsessed.
*  Yeah, I can't help myself.
*  Matt's a big F1 fan, folks, just as is Peter Atiyah.
*  So anyway, the awesome upswing that you're experiencing
*  for your circadian rhythm prevents you
*  from sleeping in further.
*  But now let's reverse the table.
*  Let's take the evening type,
*  and I put them into bed at 9 p.m. or 10 p.m.
*  when normally they will not be ready for sleep until 1 a.m.
*  And they're lying in bed, and they are wide awake,
*  and they cannot fall asleep.
*  And this is the principal reason
*  that I will get evening types coming to me,
*  and they'll say, look, I think I've got terrible insomnia.
*  I just have, and there are, you know,
*  you can think about insomnia in lots of different ways,
*  but there may be two broad categories.
*  One is that you have sleep onset insomnia,
*  I can't fall asleep, or the second is
*  I have sleep maintenance insomnia,
*  which is the sort of thing that you were describing,
*  which is where, and you don't have,
*  I don't think you have insomnia, but just as an example,
*  you fall asleep quickly, but you can't stay asleep.
*  That's the maintenance insomnia.
*  So they will come to me with the opposite of your concern,
*  which is that they say, I just cannot fall asleep.
*  And I say, okay, let me just ask you a few questions,
*  and we go through the chronotype questionnaire,
*  and it's very clear that they are an evening type.
*  And there's lots of different things
*  that you would want to exclude
*  to make sure they don't have insomnia,
*  and then you can say, you actually don't have insomnia,
*  you're just an evening type.
*  And you're going to bed at the wrong moment in time,
*  and if you were to try to go to bed at midnight,
*  you're not going to suffer from the problems that you have,
*  and you'll sleep through later.
*  But of course, their response is,
*  well, I need to be in work by 8 a.m.,
*  and I've got an hour commute,
*  so I have to be awake at 6.30,
*  so I need to be in bed by 10.
*  So on both of these ends, you can see that the morning type
*  who goes to bed too late falls asleep easily,
*  but can't stay asleep.
*  The evening type who is forced to go to bed too early,
*  they can't fall asleep, but then they stay asleep,
*  and when the alarm goes off at 6.30 a.m.,
*  they don't want to wake up.
*  So this is why when you sleep out of synchrony
*  with your chronotype, things do not look good.
*  So in those two circumstances,
*  let's say that I standardize it.
*  Everyone is going to go to bed at 10 p.m.
*  and wake up at 6 a.m.
*  And let's say that we've got a morning type,
*  not an extreme morning type,
*  who kind of likes to go to bed around 9.45,
*  they are going to sleep very well.
*  It's very close to their natural rhythm.
*  And then I get an extreme evening type
*  who likes to go to bed at 2 a.m.,
*  and I have them sleep the same opportunity amount,
*  eight hours, at the very same time.
*  Well, surely they should be identical.
*  They're not going to be.
*  It's not that they don't have the same opportunity.
*  They do, eight hours.
*  It's just that one is placed at the inappropriate time
*  on the 24-hour clock for the evening type,
*  but appropriately for the morning type.
*  And thus the quality of sleep that they each have
*  is very different.
*  And that's why you always need to build into a metric
*  of what is good sleep.
*  It's not just about quantity or quality
*  or getting it regular.
*  It's also about where do you place
*  your sleep opportunity window on that 24-hour clock face
*  to align with your chronotype.
*  When you fight biology, you normally lose,
*  and the way you know you've lost is disease and sickness.
*  That's why to me that final T of QQRT is so critical.
*  Does that sort of unpack and explain this?
*  Beautifully, yes, beautifully.
*  And as you were finishing up there,
*  I was thinking that, first of all,
*  we've heard of chronotypes, or many of us have,
*  but the way you described it is extremely clear
*  as to why this almost has to be the case.
*  Because if we think about the extreme example
*  of mistimed sleep, which is shift work,
*  being awake at night and sleeping during the day,
*  essentially nobody has that chronotype.
*  But people force it upon themselves.
*  And by the way, thank you shift workers, we need you.
*  Yeah, if I have an appendicitis at four a.m. in the morning,
*  I'm very grateful for people who can help save my life.
*  Right, truckers, airline employees, and on and on.
*  Nurses, et cetera, parents taking care of kids
*  in the middle of the night, that's shift work.
*  But we know that there are health issues associated
*  with being nocturnal and sleeping during the day.
*  But of course, there are a bunch of other variables,
*  like lack of availability of sunlight
*  if you're sleeping during the day and you're awake at night.
*  But I realize there's no reason to think
*  that one can slide their sleep timing around
*  even by a few hours and still get away with it.
*  In other words, this notion of chronotypes
*  makes perfect sense, it's just that the shift work
*  is the most extreme example of being out of sync
*  with your chronotype.
*  So I'm certainly gonna take this chronotype test,
*  but I'll tell you right now, if I could get to sleep
*  tonight at nine and wake up at four,
*  that would feel so good.
*  I'm gonna put you in my car, I'm gonna do an intervention
*  and you are gonna be in bed by nine o'clock this evening,
*  non-negotiable.
*  Fair enough.
*  So we have QQRT, quantity, quality, regularity and timing.
*  How do we know if we're getting enough sleep?
*  And this is something that you say seven to nine hours,
*  I've heard, well, if you're feeling alert during the day,
*  but perhaps have just a little bit of that
*  postprandial dip, is that how I get that right?
*  Then you're probably okay, but presumably there's
*  some other ways to gauge whether or not
*  we're getting enough sleep or not.
*  So there are certainly some ways that we do it in science
*  and clinically, but let's let those go for a second
*  and just say for people listening,
*  what are some very easy tests?
*  I think the first test that I would offer is
*  if your alarm clock didn't go off tomorrow morning,
*  would you sleep past your alarm clock?
*  And if the answer is yes, which for many people it will be,
*  then you're not getting enough sleep.
*  No other species as well, by the way,
*  artificially terminates their sleep.
*  It's so interesting.
*  But we humans will do it.
*  We will wrench ourselves out of sleep.
*  Now, I told you that regularity is key
*  and I do have an alarm clock.
*  I usually wake up close to it or a little bit before it.
*  So I do advocate an alarm clock.
*  In fact, I would argue that you should have two alarm clocks.
*  You should have a to bed alarm clock
*  and to wake alarm clock.
*  Most of us only use an alarm clock in the morning.
*  Why don't we have it to tell us when it's time to go to bed?
*  So I have both of those.
*  So I would say that it's good to use
*  to keep yourself regular,
*  but truly if you would sleep past that alarm time,
*  then you're probably not, you're not done with sleep.
*  Your body isn't done with sleep
*  and animals would never do that.
*  And so I think that's the first metric.
*  Another metric, sometimes it's not that incredibly specific,
*  but have you ever been driving day after day after day
*  and sometimes you think,
*  I don't know if that light was red or green
*  that I just went through.
*  Inattentiveness.
*  How fast are you driving, man?
*  I'm like, bite your tongue, Walker, bite your tongue.
*  So that was you.
*  I may have been.
*  That's one potential concern.
*  In fact, one of the ways that we've developed a metric
*  for dose response to sleep deprivation
*  is using concentration and alertness tests.
*  So in other words, if there is a breathalyzer
*  for a lack of sleep, doing these concentration,
*  focus concentration tests is, they are so sensitive.
*  They're so predictive.
*  You get people just to focus on the screen
*  and start to do very basic stimulus response.
*  And they can do that for the first minute or two.
*  With stimulus response, for those that don't know,
*  it might be three letters pop up on a screen
*  and then you pick two keys.
*  You have access to two keys on the keyboard.
*  If there are two letters that are similar,
*  you press right, right key.
*  If there's only one, there aren't two
*  or more letters that are similar, you press left key.
*  Simple things, but when you have to pay attention to a rule
*  and you're just doing a lot of different trials
*  of different rules.
*  And it just becomes monotonous.
*  It's not really very challenging.
*  But you have to pay attention.
*  And that perfectly mimics in some ways,
*  but we don't do it for two or three minutes.
*  We'll have you do it for 10 minutes.
*  And my goodness is it mind numbing.
*  I mean, it's kind of just, but it mimics very well.
*  Think about just even a one hour road trip
*  at 10 o'clock in the evening.
*  And you're on the motorway, the freeway.
*  All you've got to do is just focus on the road
*  and the white lines are coming and there's nothing much
*  to do and you've got to attend and focus not for 10 minutes,
*  but for 60 minutes.
*  When you are under slept, one of the dangers,
*  the big problems with a lack of sleep
*  is that you don't know you are sleep deprived
*  when you are sleep deprived.
*  And we know this because when I'm tracking
*  your performance objectively,
*  it's going down and down and down.
*  But when I'm asking you subjectively,
*  how do you think you're doing in terms of your performance?
*  You say, I'm hanging in there.
*  So far, I'm good.
*  So subjectively, you think you're fine,
*  but objectively, you're not.
*  The analogy would be a drunk driver at a bar.
*  They've had seven or eight beers, they've had six shots.
*  And they pick up the car keys and they say to you,
*  look, I'm fine to drive home.
*  And your response is no, I know that you subjectively
*  think you're fine to drive, but trust me,
*  objectively you're not, I'll just call you a taxi.
*  Don't worry, it's fine.
*  It's the same way with a lack of sleep.
*  So I make this point about going through the traffic lights
*  because you can have these lapses of attention.
*  And these lapses of attention are caused by microsleeps.
*  Microsleeps happen when the brain, just very briefly,
*  it's almost like one of those toy ducks
*  that kind of dips its bill into the water
*  and then sort of comes back up again and dips it.
*  Your brain just drops down and has a quick sample of sleep,
*  a microsleep, and we can measure it in your eyelid
*  that your eyelid starts to have what's called
*  a partial closure, and it just kind of goes
*  half the way over, or it closes fully shut.
*  That's a microsleep.
*  Even when it's half open, your brain is essentially offline.
*  It's in a sleep-like state.
*  We can measure it, and then it comes back online.
*  So I bring that.
*  That's a very long way of saying,
*  that's the second metric I would use.
*  Are you having these absences where you just kind of lapse?
*  Another is that, you mentioned it before,
*  I just don't feel restored.
*  You could say, look, I sleep for probably around
*  about seven and three-quarter hours every night,
*  but I just don't feel awake.
*  I don't feel refreshed.
*  So can you operate without needing caffeine
*  and have good grace, good mood, and good cognition
*  without needing caffeine before 11 a.m. in the morning?
*  And if the answer is no, you may be self-medicating
*  your state of insufficient sleep,
*  but that metric of saying, I sleep seven hours and 45 minutes,
*  that's what my sleep tracker says,
*  but I don't feel refreshed,
*  that comes to the second cue of QQRT.
*  Sufficient quantity of sleep, my guess is that
*  I would then look at the quality of your sleep,
*  and we would probably find a deficiency
*  in the quality of your sleep.
*  So there are these different sort of tools that you can use,
*  but a good one is, do you feel refreshed
*  and restored by your sleep?
*  It's not a guarantee, any of these, but.
*  In order to answer that question,
*  do you feel refreshed and restored by your sleep,
*  could we dig just a little bit
*  into some of the contour of the day?
*  So if I get a good night's sleep,
*  which for me means going to sleep early, waking up early.
*  Which tonight we are absolutely.
*  That's the plan, I wake up pretty quickly.
*  I'm alert upon wake up, maybe five, 10 minutes
*  to get out of a semi-groggy state,
*  but sometimes I'm just eyelids open, I'm ready to go.
*  Is the latency from wake up time to full alertness,
*  is that a relevant metric?
*  The other question is whether or not
*  the postprandial dip is a relevant metric.
*  We established already that it's natural
*  to feel a bit of an energetic dip
*  somewhere in the afternoon,
*  I think you said between one and four PM.
*  One and four, yeah.
*  Something like that.
*  For me, that's true between the hours of two and three PM.
*  Assuming all other things equal,
*  I just experienced that no matter what.
*  But I could imagine some people
*  are really dragging in the afternoon
*  and they would like to know,
*  is that the normal postprandial dip
*  or is that a reflection of not getting adequate sleep?
*  Is there any way that we could just dig
*  into these two times of day as a measure
*  of evaluating one's duration and quality of sleep
*  a little bit more?
*  Beautiful questions.
*  I would say that one should not take necessarily
*  either of those two as your best metric.
*  The reason is the wake up component,
*  for some people like you,
*  you're waking up and you are good to go
*  pretty much out the gate.
*  Many people, however, will experience
*  something called sleep inertia,
*  which is this, it's almost this just period of time,
*  it's a bit like a sleep hangover, the first hour.
*  I'm gonna have to come back to a car analogy.
*  It's like a classic car engine
*  where you don't just pull out and you can rev it
*  and it just needs, you need to warm it up,
*  gradually bring the oil temps up.
*  And at that point, after about an hour,
*  you're up to operating temperature and you're good to go.
*  The sense of, okay, I walk through into the kitchen
*  and sort of your partner maybe looks at the dishes
*  and I say, I know, darling, I know I said
*  I was gonna wash the dishes.
*  I'm so sorry, I forgot, but can I just have my cup of coffee
*  and I'll be the very best version of myself
*  in about an hour, can we discuss it then?
*  Because right now I'm not the best version of myself.
*  That's sleep inertia and that is natural for many people.
*  Now, if you are an evening type and you're waking up early,
*  you're going to have a much heavier sleep inertia period
*  than you would do that is natural to you.
*  But I wouldn't necessarily use that as the direct measure
*  because many people will have sleep inertia
*  and if you do, you may get worried if I say,
*  oh, it's the very best measure
*  that you're not getting quality of sleep.
*  The postprandial dip, as you mentioned there before,
*  even you, the monumental organism called antihuman,
*  even you can fall prey to that and do fall prey to that.
*  So that's perfectly natural.
*  I've actually learned to love it.
*  I just love it, here it comes and I go,
*  okay, that's my circadian rhythm
*  and we'll talk more about circadian rhythm in a few minutes.
*  And if I can get 10 to 15 minutes of shut eye time
*  in that postprandial dip, then I really love it.
*  And you get, and I bounce right out of that.
*  And we'll speak about how we were designed to sleep
*  maybe in a later episode too
*  and whether that should be the way human beings are sleeping.
*  So I wouldn't necessarily use that.
*  I always have this postprandial dip.
*  Does that mean I should be worried about sleep?
*  I would say that if you have excessive daytime sleepiness
*  throughout the day where you're constantly tired
*  and that is a term that we use in sleep medicine
*  is excessive daytime sleepiness or EDS,
*  that should be of a concern.
*  I would use a slightly different metric
*  of the same question but at a different time of day.
*  Let's think about that circadian rhythm again.
*  For most people, even if you're a morning type
*  or evening type, by about 11 a.m.,
*  by about 11 a.m. midday,
*  you're really starting to get to your peak.
*  Most people are somewhere either side of the peak
*  or around that peak.
*  I would say that if you are feeling groggy
*  and not alert and awake at 11, 11.30,
*  depending on your chronotype,
*  I would use that as probably the better metric
*  of my daytime sleepiness.
*  But by the way, it's very interesting that that peak,
*  if you look at that circadian peak
*  when you're at your optimal,
*  it's both your optimal for your brain
*  but it's also for your body.
*  It's the point at which your core body temperature
*  starts to peak.
*  That's the moment where you have optimal physiology.
*  And when you look at world records
*  that have been broken in the Olympics
*  and you plot them on the basis of time of day,
*  you see this incredible, beautiful spike
*  where most people are breaking world records
*  right in that circadian sweet spot
*  around that midday period.
*  Why?
*  It's because that's the period where human physiology
*  seems to be at its optimal thermal temperature at least.
*  Fascinating, fascinating.
*  Right around sometime between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.
*  Depending on what time somebody goes to sleep and wakes up.
*  Correct, yeah.
*  And what time the chronotype is and that will vary.
*  On average, that's the way you'll see it.
*  Because for me, it would be my peak alertness
*  and physical ability work output
*  is somewhere between 10 a.m. and noon.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And that fits both with your brain.
*  And my guess is that if we were to get you into the gym
*  and have you go through your routine
*  and see if we could do that routine
*  once we've got a basal set of metrics,
*  I will have you do it at 7 a.m.,
*  then have you do it at 9 a.m.,
*  then do it at midday, then 3 p.m., then 6 p.m.,
*  and then 10 p.m.
*  Same workout, same human being.
*  But there will be definitive periods of time in the day
*  when you are optimal.
*  And my guess is that that optimality of brain
*  is matched by optimality of body,
*  such that your peak performance output
*  and let's say your peak jump height
*  or your peak muscle strength
*  would be right around those time periods
*  that fit with your own circadian chronotype rhythmicity.
*  So you've been talking about this 24-hour oscillation
*  in sleep-wake activity called the circadian rhythm.
*  Maybe we can drill a little bit deeper
*  into the circadian rhythm.
*  You know, what is it, what can shift it,
*  if it indeed can shift.
*  And I'm especially curious about forces
*  other than the circadian rhythm
*  that have an impact on sleepiness, sleep, and wakefulness.
*  So the way we think about it in sleep science
*  and there is some argument
*  that it's maybe even more complex than this,
*  but for the most part, there are two main forces,
*  two main processes that will determine
*  when you want to be awake and when you want to be asleep.
*  The first of those we've spoken about,
*  which is your circadian rhythm.
*  And that circadian rhythm is
*  you have a clock inside of your brain.
*  You have a central 24-hour clock, and it's a master clock.
*  And that clock, as you've spoken about many times,
*  is called the suprachiasmatic nucleus.
*  We don't have to get hung up on the statement.
*  Just think about it as your master 24-hour clock.
*  And it beats out this rhythmic sort of message
*  of activity for us because we're diurnal during the day,
*  and then inactivity at night, activity during the day.
*  And it just goes up and down, up and down, every single day.
*  That's your circadian rhythm, and that's the suprachiasmatic.
*  The reason I say it's the master clock,
*  we've now learned that there are these circadian rhythm clocks
*  in almost all cells of the body.
*  You've got clocks all over your body
*  in these tiny little clocks.
*  But a little bit like Lord of the Rings,
*  just like there's one ring to rule them all,
*  well, there's one clock to rule them all,
*  and that is the central brain clock,
*  the suprachiasmatic nucleus.
*  Now, you can dissociate those different clocks,
*  and you can get them kind of doing some funky things,
*  but for the most part, it's the central time giver.
*  So you would think that, well, that's all you need
*  to tell your brain and your body it's time to sleep
*  or it's time to be awake.
*  It's not.
*  There is a second force in place here,
*  and it is called proce, or we sometimes call it,
*  as process S, or sleep pressure.
*  So you've got your circadian rhythm on the one hand
*  going up and down every 24 hours,
*  but then you've got this funny thing called sleep pressure.
*  Sleep pressure comes down to a chemical
*  that is called adenosine.
*  So from the moment that you and I woke up this morning
*  and everyone listening,
*  a chemical has been building up in your brain.
*  That chemical is called adenosine.
*  And the more of it that builds up,
*  the sleepier and you sleepier you will feel.
*  And after about 16 or so hours of being awake,
*  there is enough of that sleepiness chemical,
*  that adenosine sleep pressure,
*  and by the way, it is a chemical pressure.
*  It's not a mechanical pressure.
*  You don't have to worry that your head's gonna explode
*  if you go longer than 16 hours a week,
*  but that sleep pressure is going to start weighing down
*  on your shoulders, and you can sense that feeling
*  where you start to think,
*  you're watching television,
*  you're starting to go down sort of the hill
*  and you think, I should go to bed, I'm tired now.
*  That's because of one of two things that's happening.
*  Firstly, you're getting to that peak crescendo of adenosine
*  where it's just getting so powerful
*  that it's knocking you over and you're ready for sleep.
*  Usually when you are in synchrony with all of your biology,
*  these two forces, your circadian rhythm
*  that goes up and down every 24 hours,
*  and your sleep pressure align in this beautiful
*  sort of Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers Dance partnership,
*  and they're in harmony.
*  The strange thing is that they know nothing
*  about each other and they don't care about each other.
*  One does not influence the other.
*  They are completely two independent things,
*  but let me run it out in the normal circumstance
*  and then I'll describe to you a good example
*  of how I can separate those two
*  and show you that they're truly independent.
*  So normally when we're in a sort of stable rhythm
*  of sleep-wake activity, we're awake during the day,
*  we've got this awesome upswing of our circadian rhythm,
*  and then in the evening, let's just take you for example,
*  as you're getting into that sort of eight, nine p.m. region,
*  your circadian rhythm has finished its peak many hours ago
*  and it's now starting to descend down
*  and you're getting onto the steep phase
*  of its downward sort of stroke
*  of its awesome downward movement.
*  But also don't forget that at that moment,
*  your sleep pressure, your adenosine,
*  is also now at its peak.
*  You've been awake for now almost 16 hours.
*  So the moment when your circadian rhythm
*  is on its nice downward swing
*  and your highest in your levels of adenosine
*  in your sleep pressure, that's the moment truly
*  that will determine, okay, now is when I feel nice and sleepy.
*  So then what happens?
*  Then you go to sleep.
*  You come down that curve of your circadian rhythm
*  and you kind of hit its nadir, its lowest point
*  in the middle of your sleep phase.
*  But also when you go to sleep,
*  that second factor of sleep pressure,
*  your brain gets the chance to clear away that adenosine.
*  And it seems to be about a seven to nine hour period of sleep
*  is enough time for your brain to jettison
*  all of that adenosine that has been building up
*  across the 16 hours of prior wakefulness.
*  And then these two things align beautifully again.
*  When it comes to your natural wake up time,
*  you've been asleep for let's say seven and a half hours,
*  you've cleared out all of that adenosine,
*  so you no longer have the weight of that sleepiness
*  pushing you down.
*  But also your circadian rhythm is now on its awesome upswing.
*  And when those two things align,
*  when you dissipated and jettisoned all of that sleep pressure
*  and your circadian rhythm is starting to rise,
*  now that's the time when you would naturally wake up.
*  So that's things when they are working well and in alignment.
*  Let's say that I now take you
*  and I'm going to deprive you of sleep for 24 hours.
*  So now coming into sort of 10 p.m.,
*  your circadian rhythm is dropping down
*  and your adenosine is starting to get high.
*  And by about 2 a.m., you're probably not going to be happy.
*  By about 4 a.m. or 5 a.m., you're miserable.
*  Why?
*  Because you've now been awake,
*  let's say for almost 20 hours straight,
*  so you've got all of this excess sleepiness, adenosine,
*  pushing you down, screaming at you.
*  You've been awake for 20 hours.
*  And your circadian rhythm is at its lowest point,
*  desperately wanting to pull you into this thing called sleep.
*  And you feel terrible.
*  But then something strange happens.
*  By 11 o'clock in the morning, relative to let's say,
*  you've now been awake for many more hours still.
*  So you've built up even more adenosine.
*  So the prediction would be that if it's just adenosine alone,
*  that makes the difference.
*  You should feel even worse at 11 a.m.
*  You don't, you feel better despite being awake for longer.
*  Why?
*  Because your circadian rhythm has come to the rescue
*  and it's now starting its upswing.
*  And it lessens the distance between those two
*  and you feel a little bit more alert.
*  But then as I push through later into the day,
*  by about 6 p.m., 7 p.m., you're now on your circadian
*  downswing once again and you've been awake for even longer.
*  And at that point, there's almost nothing
*  that can keep you awake.
*  You're gonna be falling asleep on your feet and your toast.
*  But that's a nice demonstration
*  of how you can separate those two.
*  And despite one continuing on, you can start to feel better
*  because the other has come to your rescue.
*  And that shows me that your circadian rhythm
*  doesn't care about how much adenosine is in your brain.
*  It's just gonna keep going up and down,
*  up and down every 24 hours.
*  And your adenosine level doesn't really care much
*  about your circadian rhythm.
*  It's gonna just build and build and build
*  the longer and longer that you're awake
*  and then get dissipated whenever it is that you sleep.
*  The clearance of adenosine, I'm curious about it.
*  How does that work?
*  So this chemical adenosine is building up in our brain.
*  Does it also build up in the body?
*  It does, but in the brain,
*  it has this very interesting influence.
*  Now, I've described it as making you sleepier,
*  and it does, that's exactly what it does.
*  But it does it in a very, very interesting way.
*  It's a bidirectional way.
*  There are at least two different adenosine receptors
*  or adenosine welcome sites within the brain.
*  And adenosine is very clever in how it makes you sleepy.
*  Adenosine, as it's rising, will turn down the volume
*  on the wake-promoting regions of your brain,
*  but yet it will increase the volume
*  on your sleep-promoting regions.
*  And by way of this dual action,
*  that's how it seems to instigate this feeling of sleepiness,
*  by tamping, putting the brakes on wakefulness,
*  but hitting the accelerator pedal on sleepiness.
*  But then, adenosine seems to be part,
*  or one of the reasons that it builds up,
*  is because it's a metabolic byproduct
*  of cellular activity, of cellular metabolism.
*  And it seems to be that the longer that we're awake,
*  because our brain is very cerebrally active during the day,
*  even though I told you that the brain state of sleep
*  is very active, it is,
*  it's a very metabolically active state of sleep.
*  It is less metabolically active, however,
*  during deep non-REM sleep.
*  And it seems to be that it's deep non-REM sleep
*  that is the principal time when we clear,
*  we get the chance to clear away adenosine.
*  Now, adenosine clearance is happening all of the time.
*  It's just that the rate of accumulation when we're awake
*  exceeds the speed with which we can naturally clear.
*  But when our brain goes into deep non-REM sleep
*  and becomes less metabolically active,
*  it's not as though there's necessarily a more active
*  or a very proactive state of deep sleep doing that cleansing.
*  It's not, it's the same process of adenosine clearance.
*  It's just that there is no longer
*  the accumulation that's happening.
*  So it gets the chance to catch up
*  on the day's adenosine accumulation,
*  and then reduce down that adenosine debt,
*  and then get you to net-net neutral by the morning.
*  And in fact, the amount of deep sleep,
*  the quality of that deep sleep that you're getting,
*  specifically the electrical quality of your deep sleep,
*  is a very good predictor
*  of how well you dissipate that sleepiness.
*  Again, it's not as though there's something special
*  about non-REM sleep that is proactively
*  doing the cleansing faster than happens when we're awake.
*  It's just that the rate of accumulation when we're awake
*  is greater than the exceeding,
*  and exceeds the capacity of the clearance, so it builds up.
*  When we go into non-REM, less metabolically active,
*  it now, the clearance exceeds the buildup,
*  and you're able to cleanse that debt.
*  I have two more questions.
*  The first is about growth hormone.
*  So I was taught that growth hormone
*  is released primarily in sleep,
*  although there are some daytime activities
*  that can promote the release of growth hormone as well.
*  Certain forms of exercise, maybe some thermal stimuli,
*  but the major event of growth hormone release
*  occurs in sleep.
*  Is that true?
*  It is, although there is some argument that it is,
*  is it sleep-dependent, or is it simply sleep coinciding?
*  Meaning that it's that, at the time of day,
*  so is it a circadian process,
*  where it's just nighttime-ness,
*  means that you release growth hormone,
*  or is it nighttime plus sleep that is needed?
*  And it seems to be a mixture of both,
*  but it seems to be more sleep-dependent
*  than it is nighttime-dependent and sleep-independent.
*  I probably should have said before,
*  growth hormone, critically important
*  for growth of children during development,
*  but also for tissue repair and metabolism
*  throughout the lifespan.
*  Throughout the lifespan.
*  When we're adults, we critically need it.
*  So if I understand correctly,
*  when one goes to sleep, growth hormone is released,
*  but that there's a circadian component as well.
*  So it's a bit of an and gate, as they say,
*  which is that you need this and that
*  in order to get growth hormone release.
*  And the reason I ask this,
*  and I'm gonna frame it this way
*  because I think it's gonna both clarify what you said
*  and also lead to a practical step,
*  which is about sleep regularity and timing.
*  I've heard that the growth hormone surge
*  is greatest at the beginning of the night of sleep,
*  and that if we go to sleep a few hours later than usual,
*  we miss the opportunity to experience
*  the same level of growth hormone release,
*  even if we sleep the same total number of hours.
*  So yet more incentive for regular sleep timing.
*  Yes.
*  So you're right, it's an and gate.
*  So it's nighttimeness does help,
*  but sleep helps perhaps significantly more,
*  meaning that I can have you experience the nighttime,
*  but I can deprive you of sleep
*  and selectively of deep non-REM sleep,
*  and I can markedly impair your growth hormone release.
*  Put differently, I think, tell me if this is correct,
*  put differently, if somebody has to work the night shift
*  and they sleep during the day,
*  they'll still get a growth hormone release,
*  but not as much growth hormone release
*  were they to have slept at night.
*  Correct, so we can do it one of two ways.
*  So my way is to say, I keep you on a diurnal,
*  nocturnal sort of schedule where you're awake
*  during the day and you sleep at night,
*  but I'm going to selectively deprive you
*  of just your deep sleep at night.
*  So you're still sleeping,
*  and you're still spending the nighttimeness in bed,
*  which is not the shift work version,
*  but I can block or not block,
*  I can significantly reduce your growth hormone
*  because I selectively deprive you of sleep,
*  or I can do the opposite,
*  which is the shift work approach,
*  which is I'm not going to deprive you of sleep,
*  you're going to sleep during the day,
*  but now I have held sleep constant.
*  So in my version, I have held nighttimeness constant,
*  and I've manipulated sleep.
*  In your version, the shift worker, we've done the opposite.
*  We've held sleep constant, they're sleeping during the day,
*  but we've manipulated nighttimeness.
*  And now, as you said,
*  yes, they will release some growth hormone,
*  even though that's not the natural time on the 24-hour clock
*  when we would see growth hormone released.
*  Why? Because they are getting sleep,
*  because it's a somewhat sleep-dependent process,
*  but they're not going to necessarily release as much,
*  in part because they're not experiencing sleep
*  at nighttime phases.
*  So you can elegantly separate those two out,
*  and that's why it's not quite one or the other,
*  but it seems to be both.
*  Certainly, it's a sleep-sensitive,
*  I would say sleep-sensitive
*  is a very good way of describing it.
*  Okay, so translated to actionable protocol,
*  everyone should strive to get sleep, ideally, at night,
*  of sufficient quality and quantity,
*  which you already discussed,
*  and getting sufficient amounts of deep sleep
*  is going to be especially important
*  for sake of growth hormone release.
*  Correct. Got it.
*  My last question has to do with the other end
*  of the sleep cycle, which is toward morning and waking,
*  which is the hormone cortisol.
*  We hear so often these days about cortisol,
*  and people often frame it as bad.
*  Cortisol is bad.
*  You hear this. That is simply not true.
*  Remove cortisol from an organism, they will not do well.
*  Right, and we need cortisol for immune system function,
*  for waking, for certain forms of memory formation,
*  although too much cortisol is a bad thing, indeed.
*  Not enough cortisol is an equally bad thing, indeed.
*  So what is the relationship between cortisol
*  and emerging from sleep?
*  And put differently, what is the relationship
*  between deep sleep and cortisol,
*  meaning is sleep one way that we keep cortisol at bay
*  during stages of the 24-hour cycle
*  when it would be deleterious to have elevated cortisol?
*  Yes, it is.
*  And that's one of, I spoke about,
*  and we'll come onto this perhaps when we speak
*  about emotional and mental health,
*  and when we are under slept, we shift over
*  into a more sort of activated, sympathetic,
*  agitated state of our nervous system.
*  That's one aspect of it, but there's another aspect
*  of the stress response, which is yes,
*  you get elevated heart rate, you're more sympathetic,
*  which is this activated state rather than parasympathetic,
*  but you also get, when you're sleep deprived,
*  a greater release of the stress hormonal axis,
*  which is called the HPA axis,
*  which if you really want to go into detail,
*  it's the hypothalamopetuitary adrenal axis,
*  which is a fancy way of saying that it's a signal
*  from your brain going down to release cortisol.
*  So when you go into deep sleep, not only do you shift over
*  into the nice quiet, rested, quiescent state
*  of the nervous system, but you also get a dissipation
*  in that stress-related axis and the release of cortisol.
*  Cortisol, however, seems to be also under the strict control
*  of your circadian rhythm, where it drops down at night,
*  and in fact, you have one of the steepest declines
*  right at the moment when you're starting to get sleepy too,
*  almost as though your brain and your body know
*  we can't have cortisol even at sort of normative levels
*  that you would have during the day,
*  because otherwise this person is just gonna still be
*  a little bit too wired.
*  This is the problem with a stressful event
*  after say 8 p.m. at night.
*  If you see something stressful,
*  experience something stressful,
*  I mean, if it's stressful enough,
*  it will spike your cortisol at that late hour,
*  it can really impede your entire sleep structure.
*  I would say it's one of the things that I would advocate
*  in terms of a good sleep-optimized routine,
*  and we can come onto that.
*  And avoiding stress and arguments and disturbing news
*  and things like that as much as possible
*  in the late evening and early night hours.
*  Even if you don't think you're necessarily
*  someone who's sensitive to that,
*  now it turns out I am someone who is sensitive to that,
*  it can really quite trigger me, so I stay away from it.
*  We often see this with insomnia too,
*  and we call it the tired but wired phenomenon.
*  And people will say to me, look, I am just so tired.
*  Matt, I am so, so tired, but I'm just so wired
*  that I can't fall asleep.
*  I'm desperate for sleep, I know I want sleep,
*  but I can't fall asleep, because I'm just so wired.
*  And that is a sympathetic hyper cortisol state,
*  and you can see it in their physiology.
*  But coming back to your question,
*  cortisol will drop naturally throughout the night,
*  but then it starts to rise back up,
*  and will start to produce its fantastic sort of peak
*  climbing rate right at the moment when you would naturally
*  again want to wake up.
*  So what we're mapping here is this wonderful tapestry,
*  this kaleidoscope of coordinated biology,
*  that your adenosine levels are finally coming
*  to their lowest point, your circadian rhythm
*  is starting to rise, your cortisol levels
*  are starting to rise, your core body temperature
*  is starting to increase because it's dropped
*  throughout the night.
*  All of these things unite in this beneficial timing ballet
*  of just brilliance that naturally has you waking up
*  and feeling like you're ready to go
*  if everything is aligned.
*  If you've got your chronotype right,
*  your sleep quantity, your quality, regularity,
*  and your sleeping in appropriate sort of timed amounts.
*  Well, your enchantment with sleep is indeed infectious.
*  I've experienced it and I know that everyone listening
*  and watching has experienced it as well,
*  as you've taken us through this truly spectacular voyage
*  through this phenomenon that we call sleep.
*  I mean, you informed us about what sleep is,
*  what the different sleep cycles are,
*  how they are structured and interrelated.
*  You talked to us about the four macronutrients
*  of good sleep, quantity, quality, regularity, and timing.
*  It's highly actionable information.
*  And then of course, some of the hormonal neurochemical
*  interactions and consequences of good sleep, bad sleep,
*  for mental health, physical health, and performance.
*  So first, I'd like to just extend a giant thank you
*  for taking us on this voyage in this first of several
*  or more episodes of this mini series on sleep.
*  And I very much look forward to our discussion
*  in the next episode about how to improve one's sleep
*  and perhaps even optimize one's sleep.
